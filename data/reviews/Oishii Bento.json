{"text":"Come here all the time for years. Great service. Very professional and food is very consistent."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey for a sushi roll lunch, but the rolls themselves were flavorful and attractive. I will definitely be going back to get my sushi fix on campus.

However. 

This place lost a whole star for me because of the atmosphere. It's cute but a little crowded and frantic. For the price, I'd also want to be eating with real, washable plates and cups instead of styrofoam and plastic."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for Korean food. This was my first time visiting and I would definitely visit again based on my experience. Food was very reasonably priced considering the size of the portions that were given. Be sure to check their daily specials!

I don't understand all of the 3 star or less reviews. They seem to be just very picky people and maybe it wasn't up to their \"standards,\"  but before you go believing their nonsense, give this place a try. The food was delicious, got it within 10 minutes (remember that speed doesn't always equal satisfaction. They cook the food fresh per order; expect about a 10-15 minute wait) and the staff was very nice. Will come here again!"}
{"text":"Katsu don was good. It might be too sweet for someone, but for me it was just right. 
However, it took around 15-20 minutes for this menu. I'm not sure whether it was an average time for here, or just for this dish. 
I will go back here again if I'm not in rush."}
{"text":"Consistently great food for the value!

The galbi bento was great as well as the variety of sushi we got was great. $10 Minimum for credit cards.I strongly recommend Oishii!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The lunchboxes are great and very reasonably priced. I also often go for the bowls, which are basically some kind of meat with veggies over rice (and are also just $6). Not a sushi eater, but they have a fairly decent selection here for those interested."}
{"text":"Mmm.  This is probably the opposite of Chaya -- where I go when I want to pay very little and stuff myself with somewhat Americanized food.  Then again, what do I know about whether it's authentic?  I haven't been to Japan or Korea.

I always order the sushi, and even though I have a huge appetite when it comes to that vinegared rice, I can't usually make it through three rolls here.  These are generous portions.  The beef bowls and Korean BBQ are great too, or so I'm told.

The cushion seating along the window is cute, despite the crappy view of Oakland Avenue, but unfortunately I'm too tall to sit there comfortably (at only 5'6\"!)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here every week since arriving in Pittsburgh. Mind you, I have only ever had the beef bulgogi bowl, which is amazing! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So good! There was a line when I visited but my bentos came out in 10 mins. They were both very good. I got the spicy pork bento and the bulgogi bento. Yummy! There's a seating area upstairs so you can eat there. I saw lots of college kids, probably due to the reasonable price. 
I also tried their sushi (ocean roll), while it didn't look any different from grocery store rolls. It tasted amazing. Super fresh and lpts of flavor. 
Overall, great experience and I'd highly recommend it"}
{"text":"One of my favorites, I like the Galbi Bento - short ribs marinated in their house sauce.  Good kimchi. This place is a quick stop off to get tasty Korean food."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. The food is consistent and fresh. Only issue is the price increases I have seen the last 2 yrs. Some prices have gone up 20% although I'm willing to attribute that to operating expenses and not price fixing as I've noticed the asian eateries there seem to work together instead of competing. It is a great place, professional, unique, healthy food and quick service but I would re-evaluate if it hit $8/bowl."}
{"text":"Probably the best option for students wanting quick, tasty Asian food, but lately things have been a bit dodgy. This place is EXTREMELY popular, and because of that, I feel they have started cutting corners lately. My all-time favorite meal here is the Galbi bento. However, they recently upped the price on it (and a few other dishes) and reduced the amount of meat that comes with it. Not cool. The bentos themselves are still a pretty good deal. They come with your entree, a side of 2 dumplings (they usually don't warm these up, so if you like cold meat...), a side of glass noodle salad, picked cucumbers, white rice, and your choice of kimchi, salad, or miso soup. I get the miso soup every time, since it's the best option in my opinion. It's bigger than the other two sides in terms of volume, and their kimchi really isn't that great to begin with. I prefer the bentos at Korea Garden, but Korea Garden's bentos are a bit more expensive, and Oishii's location is a lot more convenient."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy pork bento.  It was very tasty and the portion sizes were huge.  Very student-budget friendly, but still somewhat expensive compared to the surrounding restaurants.  Will definitely be returning here again before my visit ends."}
{"text":"Totally forgot to review this place the last time I was in Pittsburgh. This small fast food style Korean-owned joint offers both Japanese and Korean dishes. While I have not tried any of the rolls the 3 times I've been here, I'm solely basing my generous rating on the Korean food because its the only place I know that can satiate this craving in the city. 

The dining area is definitely small where there is a 2nd floor and a small bar area on the first floor. And the ambiance is catered for busy people looking for a bite to eat or for the college crowd. Call in advance for your carry-out order otherwise you can wait 5-10 minutes for a walk-in order if its busy. Good portions and expect to drop $8-10 per person. 

What I've ordered:
- bibimbap - recommend 
- spicy pork bento (comes with your option of sides) - good enough

Will I come back?
- when I need a quick korean fix"}
{"text":"Great place to pick up DELICIOUS, inexpensive Korean food on the go.  I recommend the bento dishes.  You get tasty meat (beef, pork, chicken, salmon, etc...) served with rice, few fried dumplings, and rice noodles and your choice of Kimchi, salad, or miso soup, which are carefully arranged in boxed containers.  
It's not much of a sit-down place, though there is a small area upstairs with tables (which should be back open in about a month; see note below).   

I had a slight cold and had the spicy beaf soup two days in a row.  The soup did wonders in clearing up my sinuses and helping my sore throat.  

FIRE UPDATE:
in mid June, there was a fire, and the the fire damaged part of the second floor.  The place closed down for about a month and a half, but as of yesterday, they are back open!  The second floor is temporarily closed, though they now have some flat screens for the menu, and the prices are also about $.50 lower than before.  Glad Oishii is back!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of Korean fast food. Whatever you order, I recommend getting a salad bowl, miso soup and their home-made kimchi."}
{"text":"This is great for those on the hurry and go looking for cheap, yummy Korean food. You get a lit for your money. The amount is enough for two meals. If you're lucky, you can find seating on the stocks floor. If not, grab it on the go and enjoy it in the park."}
{"text":"Awesome and authentic! Even the dressing on the salad is real Japanese style and delicious. You can get a bento box and definitely feed two people. The staff was very friendly. I'm excited to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place but I couldn't get in. It's small, no place to sit. It's strictly take out.
I'm giving three stars because menu looked good. And for college area and not being able to get in due to crowd, this place must be good.
Maybe next time in town, I will make special effort to wait it out."}
{"text":"This is maybe passable as food for a rich college student, but not this well-traveled, experienced eater.

My friend and I ordered the bulgogi, a couple sushi rolls and an order of tea.  All of the food was sub-par.  First, let me say that everything comes out on Styrofoam.  Everything.  And it's accompanied with plastic forks and little packets of soy.  I wouldn't have cared if the food was half as expensive as it was, but it wasn't inexpensive by far.  Then you can take it to dine upstairs where you have a disarray of crowded shaky, unclean tables.

The tea was low-grade bagged green tea, served in a Styrofoam cup.

The sushi rolls were almost on par with what I'd expect to get from a Korean buffet.  Nothing exciting.  The special sauce was bland.  The crab, fake.  The rolls, sloppily cut.

The bulgogi was new to me, but my friend claimed it wasn't great.  I actually thought the peanut sauce was decent, the best part of the meal.  But the meat was bland, unmemorable.  

I would never come here again.  There are much higher quality places within 5 miles that are more interesting and less expensive."}
{"text":"Decent food both dining in or take away, price is kinda reasonable, goes well with the bubble tea shop just next door"}
{"text":"Wow. I went to this restaurant because I was in Pittsburgh with my son and we were hungry for Korean food. I was going by the other ratings and this restaurant looked pretty good. I had the WORST bowl of bimbimbap I've ever had in my life. It was cold and yucky with wilted unappetizing vegetables. We also had very mediocre edamame -- how do you mess that up? My son had a very generic beef bulgogi bowl that looked like he could have poured it out of a LaChoy can. It was as similar to Korean food as Taco Bell is similar to Mexican food. Didn't try the sushi and maybe should have focused on that rather than attempting hot food. Not going back."}
{"text":"I've gotten bento boxes from a few different places around Pittsburgh (Wai wai's, Zen Asian Diner) and these are the best ones around in my opinion. I usually get the spicy pork bento box. It is so delicious and it is high quality food, a large amount for a decent price. There is a nice upstairs area to eat your food, though it is somewhat small. Also, if you take your receipt next door you can get 50 cents off bubble tea. There is also complimentary tea to drink while you are waiting for your food. I am looking forward to trying more menu items here!"}
{"text":"I ordered Ton-Katsu chicken Bento couple days ago.  I thought it was made from Japanese family, but it is not.  Actually the restaurant was run by Korean and the chef was not from Korean either.  The katsu chicken was cooked too tough and without chicken taste.  Also I did not see any katsu source like Japanese family run restaurant.

Even the Korea bowl is not good because the chefs are not from Korea.

Overall, 
1. Go to other authentic Japanese run restaurant for Katsu chicken which is the Japanese food.  Do not order Ton-katsu chicken Bento.  Otherwise, you will waste your money.

2.  Go to authentic Korea restaurant with Korea chef for authentic Korea foods."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken-katsu bento, tofu bibimbap, and sushi platter.

- The sauce for the chicken bento was pretty good, but some of the chicken was a little dry.

- The tofu in the bibimbap was a bit undercooked and overall tasted a bit bland.

- The sushi was ok, but they put a little dab of wasabi in the middle. Which I wasn't told about and kinda caught me off guard (not a big fan of wasabi).

Overall, I was a little disappointed in this place after reading all the glowing reviews. If I had to eat here again, I'd stick to the chicken bento."}
{"text":"yay! i'm a fan.  I have been so disappointed by food in Pittsburgh, but oishii was goooood!  This place was so good.  fast fresh great flavour.  we got take out so it was packed well for us to go home and eat.  I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Oishii is my go-to for lunch in Oakland, as they offer generous portions of fresh, flavorful, and fairly nutritious food for a very reasonable price. I usually get the spicy pork or bulgogi bento: for less than $9 you get a big heap of meat, rice, noodle salad, 2 small fried dumplings, 2-3 pickled radish slices, and kimchi/soup/salad. It is always plenty to satisfy my hearty appetite. I'd recommend phoning your order in, as it is gets crowded during lunch."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food tasty but I didn't like being served in plastic, disposable containers while they advertise their dishes with photos of nice wooden bento boxes."}
{"text":"Waited for ages!!!!! My friends finished eating and had a bubble tea before my bento was ready"}
{"text":"The bibimbap here is really great and you have lots of different meat (or tofu if that's your thing) options. The spicy pork bowl is also really good if you want a little kick with your meal and it's always packed with a ton of pork. Lines can be a little long depending on when you arrive so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi and katsu are pretty good; good place for takeout and if you're craving Asian food"}
{"text":"Oishii Bento is irreplaceable! I haven't found anything quite like it on the east or west coast. It's quick, inexpensive, delicious, and comes in large quantities. My favorite go-to is the spicy pork bento."}
{"text":"Their bento boxes are great but my favorite thing there are their udon noodle soups. I always get takeout for that when I'm sick. They are the best udon noodles I've ever had."}
{"text":"Decent food for reasonable prices. Honestly, the best deal around in terms of quality/price. Bowls are good, bentos are not worth it, and sushi is ok, considering it is cheaper than worse attempts"}
{"text":"Oishii is one of my favorite fast takeout Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Prices are very reasonable, but its really not the best sit-down place. In terms of their menu, they have a wide variety of options and everything is very flavorful.  Personally I enjoy the chicken katsu or one of their sushi roles (customized any way you like).  The entire place is rather small, but that doesn't take away from the quality of the food. Overall, this is a great goto restaurant for people who want something different from regular takeout."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place I go to if I'm craving Japanese food apart from sushi. I normally get the Katsudon, which is pork cutluts with onions and egg over rice. The rice can be a bit dry sometimes and they normally give far too much in proportion, so I normally end up wasting half the rice. The seating area is also pretty crowded (upstairs from the register)."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place as a Korean restaurant, so I usually order something Korean such as one of the bentos: Bulgogi, spicy pork or Kalbi with salads. I like these three a lot. The salad is usually romaine hearts with sesame paste based sauce. The portion of a bento is more than enough for me even when I'm hungry. I tried the beef soup once and it was good too. 

My friend ordered sushi and shared with me. It's rolled sushi with sashimi on top, which I like better than nigiri. 

They don't have much of sitting space, but I never had problems finding seats on the second floor."}
{"text":"I visit Pittsburgh every 3 weeks and was looking for some food Asian food. I www walked in and loved this place. Vast and fresh menu, good service and many traditional Japanese and Korean foods. Reminded me of one of my favorite little finds in Tokyo."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in the college part of town, this place is pretty awesome. If it were in my neck of the woods, I would go far more often. Good food, good price, reasonably fast service, and good take-out accomodations."}
{"text":"Oishii is the only legitimate option for sushi in Oakland.  I have eaten at Sushi Boat across the street and oishii is as good as sushi boat is bad.  Oishii is a \"fast food\" type asian place but the fish is extremely fresh.  My favorite items on the menu are the rainbow roll ($8.50), spicy tuna ($4.75) and the oishii roll ($8.75).  

The rainbow roll is standard with a california roll topped with tuna, snapper, shrimp, eel, yellowtail, and salmon.  The Oishii roll is a huge inside out roll that has shrimp tempura on the inside and topped with smoked salmon covered in a house special sauce which seems to be spicy mayo.  The rainbow roll and oishii roll are a bit more expensive but are specialty rolls.  When comparing these specialty rolls to other restaurants, Oishii's are much, much cheaper.  One caveat: Oishii's rice is very sweet and most rolls are made using a lot of rice; this can make the rolls more filling, which to me is a good thing.  Normally my girlfriend and I can share three rolls and be full.  Food and price wise, I would give Oishii Bento 5 stars, but without waiter service it seems unfair to grant it a perfect 5.  

Also, Oishii is normally filled with Asians, who I assume know Asian food.  I would take their word for it."}
{"text":"Oishii Bento is one of my favorite restaurants to go to in Pittsburgh. Cheap food + good taste = great for a college student. However sometimes it's a hit or a miss. Most of the times their galbi bento is great and I love it, but sometimes the meat is dry or extra fatty or has too many bones. Their miso soup usually has a little too much base, but it's easily fixable with hot water from upstairs. Finally I wish that their korean noodles had a little more flavor as they are a little bland, but overall anything you get at Oishii bento is worth the price compared to the other korean restaurants in the area which are much pricier."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, fast, clean, delicious Korean food! My boyfriend and I almost come here every day. Beef bibimbap and unagi bowl are always my choices."}
{"text":"Cute! I love Oishii. To be honest, I just get tonkatsu bento every time and I've yet to regret it. It's a huge serving for the price, and the seating is very roomy for a counter joint. 
Not the classiest place ever, but you can't really do much better in Oakland!"}
{"text":"best Korean food in pittsburgh. It's cheap, fast, friendly service and food is the best! I've ordered the udon, bulgogi and the kalbi all are delicious! Wish they were open on Sundays though"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered the chicken katsu bento and the oishii bento. They serve it in to go boxes regardless of whether you're eating in or out. The portion was just nice. We ordered ours with miso soup and the sides that came with it include two small dumplings, pickled radish, and Korean tapioca noodle (not sure what it's really called). It was nothing special but definitely worth the value. 

We initially wanted to sit upstairs but it was warm and stuffy so we decided to eat at the nearby park instead and order some bubble tea at a different shop."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  Best (optimized) for take out.  There is seating on the second floor, its still take out trays etc... The place was very active with customers, not packed, but very busy.  It took a little bit of time, so best to call first and place your order.  Looking forward to coming back on a sunnier, warmer day.  It was a bit chilly and rainy when we went, so we never really warmed up per se.  Hence the \"atmosphere\" gets dinged by one star."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and you can get a discount for the drink next door. The beef Y... bowel is good."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest price wise, but the food is great, and service is good. I highly recommend the happy roll!"}
{"text":"Oishii has good sushi and asian food for a good price.  I'd say they're better tasting than Sushi Boat across the street, but at a slightly higher cost.  

The food here is good.  The bulgogi bowls are cheap and a great deal, and the sushi is decent quality.  Try the caterpillar roll - you won't regret it!

The inside of the place is clean and they have seating upstairs.  Staff is friendly and you don't wait too long for food.  Give it a try, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Tim has recently been introducing me to different types of cuisine that he enjoys...Oishii Bento was no exception! I was thrown off by the set-up of the restaurant: you order downstairs and wait for food upstairs in the dining area. They have a digital number caller in the dining room so you don't miss your food.  Plus, lots of plasticware, chopsticks, and free water!
This place is constantly packed (Pitt and hospitals close by) and you will find yourself sharing elbow room with someone you don't even know. Don't be alarmed! The food is excellent. I had a Chicken Katsu Bento and YUM! The rice is perfectly sticky. The Ton-Katsu sauce tastes like a rich, barbeque style (for those of us who don't regularly partake in Asian cuisine), which really complements the fried chicken. 
And yes, Tim did make me try kimchi."}
{"text":"This place is good for what it is: Cheap fast food. I wouldn't consider it a great place to take a date or a fancy meal. It's in the style of an Americanized Korean place that also does Japanese food, which is not entirely uncommon in other cities. You aren't getting the most authentic Korean food, but it's not so bad. 

I don't think the portions are so incredibly large compared to similar type places in California.

As far as Oakland eating options, this may be one of the best for quality, taste, value."}
{"text":"Oishii Bento is a great place to get a quick lunch when you're on the go - it's always packed with Korean students, which is a good sign in my books, and if you put the number in your phone and call while enroute, your order will be ready and waiting for you to skip the (reasonable) wait! 

My favorite is the katsudon, a breaded chicken cutlet cooked in a broth with scrambled eggs and onions and served over rice. The portion is HUGE, definitely enough for 1.5-2 meals or for one person who isn't counting calories. The bento are also fantastic, with fried gyoza, glass noodle salad, pickled daikon, rice, salad/kimchi and generous portion of the main dish. My favorite is the Oishii Bento itself with shrimp tempura over veggies in sauce, and any bento here is pretty much a \"eat this and skip dinner\" meal. 

My office orders the big sushi trays ($50) for parties, and they are a huge hit. For cheap sushi, you can't beat this place, because the fish is actually good and the presentation is also very nice. If you have a big sushi order, definitely call in advance or order at an off-peak time, because the sushi chef is one of the busiest of their cooks. 

Overall, a great Japanese/Korean food addition to the Oakland area, and everything is very authentic and tasty!"}
{"text":"Traveling from NYC and dopped by here.
Take out one Bento!

Very good value and great food with good price. Extremely good price for the quality for sure!

You can get like 2 person portion amount of tasty/healthy rice(Tasty!), side of delicious authentic Korean KimChi, asian raddish pickle and 2 dumplings in one Bento (Just $10)!!!!! 


This asian.. haha... will definitely recommend this place to friends !!

Enjoy your bento ^^
Will try other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Waited around 10 minutes for my food, I got the kimchi udon and the sushi burrito (on the menu it is listed as Japanese burrito).

I asked for the kimchi udon to be spicy. While the broth was somewhat spicy, it wasn't enough for me to actually call it as spicy. Regardless, it came with a healthy portion of vegetables and a lot of udon. It actually was enough to last me two days (and for under $9, that's insane!)

The sushi burrito was an experience of its own as well. The rice was seasoned PERFECTLY, everything inside tasted amazing. Unfortunately, my shrimp tempura inside was a bit soggy but everything else about this creation was mind blowing. 

Definitely would recommend this place, the prices are insane and the portions are great!"}
{"text":"2.0/5 - Ocean Roll (Tuna/Salmon)
2.5/5 - Spicy Pork Bowl: Generous portion, good flavor, very spicy, a tad dry.
4.0/5 - Galbi Beef: succulent flavor and tender"}
{"text":"The best Asian bento in town! They cook upon receiving orders and don't just heat up the cooked ones and serve them - one thing I really like about the restaurant! Also the staff there are always nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently have their galbi bento and oishi bento take-out as out dinner. Very convenient and delicious."}
{"text":"First of all, everything is delicious. From their Bento plates, to their sushi, to their bowls and even their awkward Japanese burrito (yes... even though it is what you think it is, it's so freaking delicious.)

The food is priced like fast food, but the quality would give no indication of that. If you were only to eat at one Asian themed restaurant in Oakland, give this one a try."}
{"text":"I really like their rainbow roll and california roll. And the beef bowl is really good, but be cautious, you may need to remove the odor out of your clothes."}
{"text":"Bento tastes really good, especially for east asian taste. 
Sushi is ok, though a little bit expensive."}
{"text":"Phenomenal for lunch. The menu has a wide range of dishes, but the bowls are where it's at. Food is competitively priced and pretty quick, and it will be more than enough to fill you up. I don't even know if you can eat in, but the takeout service is great.

Favorites so far: chicken & beef teriyaki bowl and the chicken katsu bowl. The teriyaki bowls are pretty standard: protein, vegetable, rice. The teriyaki sauce is very nicely balanced, and doesn't have the overpowering saltiness that is so prevalent elsewhere. This is the kind of sauce you won't mind your rice ending up drenched in. Chicken katsu is breaded, fried chicken served on top of rice and with a tonkatsu sauce. Only wish it came with some vegetables. Both super tasty, recommend."}
{"text":"Good lunchboxes and pretty reasonable prices. There's seating upstairs so there's almost never a wait. My only complaint is parking options - but Oakland is always tough."}
{"text":"Tried veggie udon. It's nothing special about it. Soup base is too heavy for me, but kimchi is excellent."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint.  Having seen photos/read reviews, I took a chance and stopped by for lunch.  I had the pork cutlet Bento box.  The serving size was quite impressive.  I have a huge appetite and the box filled me up.  I'm not sure what all I ate, but everything, and I mean everything ,was delicious.  The service was somewhat slow, but it was quite worth it, because the food is delicious and the price is right.   I will be back."}
{"text":"It's like Korean and Japanese fast food. You can get sushi (its hard to get good sushi in Pittsburgh so by those standards, its pretty decent). You can also get the usual Korean fare: bulgogi, galbi, and kimchi. My favorite is the galbi bento (although its over $8 so I don't usually get it), or the bulgogi bowl. 

The bento boxes come with a little bit of chap chae (Korean glass noodles), kim chi, a salad with \"oriental dressing\", japanese yellow pickles, a few pot stickers (not bad, not good), and of course, whatever entree you ordered. 

The bowls are simple: rice topped with meat. Yum! 

The space is small though so its okay for 4-people groups."}
{"text":"I think that this is a good place for a casual, japanese or korean meal.  I usually skip the sushi because I find low-priced sushi, particularly in Pittsburgh, to not be worth eating.  Instead I usually order either the chicken katsu or beef bulgogi, both of which are quite good.  I don't like their udon - the selection of things in it, which includes broccoli, doesn't do much for me.  The shrimp tempura is all right, but if it's ordered in a bento box, it will probably get soggy from the broth before it makes it to your table.  The unagi isn't bad for the price, particularly since it's in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"places like Oishii Bento make me wish I lived on or near a college campus.    If oishii Bento wore 66 it would score a natural hat trick, Its good, cheap and for the area its unique.  I must say thinking about OB brings out the poet in me.

Two roads diverged from a steel city
Shogun? OB? oh hell with Hibachi
The flying shrimp out of our way
Parking nearby we shall pray
Bento boxes peaks my interest
and that has made all the difference"}
{"text":"The service is always friendly. This is the best place to get good Korean food fast and for a reasonable price. I love the ribs, though a bit pricier so worth! The bulgogi and spicy pork bowls/bento are always a safe option too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable bento, which is huge enough for two meals. Its was fine, but they slathered the sauce on the vegetables its was overwhelming. I also wish they had vegetable dumplings on the bento. The seating area is upstairs which I didn't know about, I was confused since there wasn't any room on the ground level. They need more vegetarian/vegan options too ,so I don't know if I would come here again."}
{"text":"this is your basic - moslty takeout - sushi joint in a college town. i felt they executed well on all points, the sushi and rolls were fresh and well prepared, and we managed to enjoy a good amount of sushi at $30/pp. Not a place for ambience - but fine to kill the bait craving. 

if your hangin near univ of pitt, this is a good place for standard sushi fare and - from what i saw - the bento offerings as well. (good portions)"}
{"text":"This place has good fresh food, especially the bento boxes. The sushi is okay, and cheap.  Jessica M. and I would go during nursing school when we needed a sushi pick-me-up after a long day. Best sushi in Oakland.

Going on off hours is a good idea if you want to sit in the big windowed, sunny upstairs room and watch the people below and discuss all the awesome places you're going to do travel nursing when you get outta dodge..."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch spot. Their beef Bibimbap bowl is excellent  and their sushi is really fresh. Just be prepared to wait, cuz they're always busy."}
{"text":"I'm realized that Pittsburgh offers some rather good bulgogi. The wait was a bit long. I've had the bulgogi bowl, which is a generous portion of meat, almost caramelized onions, mushrooms, on top of rice. I also tried the bibimbap bowl, which was veggies, eggs, bulgogi, and rice. They also give you a spicy red sauce with it (it's sort of sneaky spicy, as it tastes sweet at first and you slowly realize there's a kick to it).  I was a bit disappointed with the bibimbap bowl, however, as it had very skimpy portion of bulgogi in it."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch. Excellent and never disappoints! I love the tofu bipimbab. Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Oishii Bento is a solid lunch spot, conveniently located to Pitt's campus and the rest of Oakland.  I went there for lunch on a Thursday with one other person and enjoyed it.

I got a teriyaki tofu bento box.  The price was perfect for lunch, but the wait between ordering and it being ready was a bit long for lunch, but all in all it wasn't more than 5-10 minutes.  It was good and I'll definitely get it again the next time I go here.  It was also a lot of food, more than a reasonable lunch's amount (and I have a healthy appetite).  They also had free tea in the corner on the first floor, which was a great warm up on a snowy day in Pittsburgh.

I'll be back for lunch.  It's on my go too lunch list in Oakland."}
{"text":"Having been to cities like LA, NYC, and Washington DC, where there are many excellent Korean restaurants, I can be very critical of restaurants serving Korean food. For Pittsburgh, this is great Korean food.  They serve tasty food, quickly, and cheaply. Only problem is the parking. I had to drive around in circles to find a parking space, which is street parking and Pay parking."}
{"text":"This is definitely a good pick for budget-minded students looking for sushi or Korean food.  The restaurant itself is tiny, but the bright colors and big windows of the upstairs dining room help open it up visually.  Service was not super fast but the food was pretty good.  $5.25 gets you 12 vegetarian sushi rolls (I chose 6 avocado & 6 cucumber, but you can also get carrot.)  My boyfriend got the $7.50 bulgogi bento and I was amazed at the amount of food: side salad, pickles, 2 dumplings, a cold noodle salad, and plenty of beef and rice.

There are not too many vegetarian options so it probably won't be someplace I visit often, but the sushi was pretty good and we got a lot of food for about $15.  And there are coupons on their website, so make sure you print them off before you go!"}
{"text":"I'm really fan of Gabi bento, but for other food I don't quite like them, I think 4 star is fair enough. Sometimes I feel too full after eating Gabi bento."}
{"text":"Really homey food with great flavors. I don't think they're authentic at all, but who cares? It's delicious food, period.

I love the radishes and gyoza in their bentos. It also comes with some sort of other side that I can't remember, but great variety in a box and all really good. The portions are generous. I can never finish a bowl if I get one. The \"main\" of the bentos are more manageable for some reason? So maybe it's a psychological thing for me, or smaller compartments in the bentos than would fit in a bowl. I don't know, never done a side by side. 

I don't like the tanginess of tonkatsu and theirs had very bold flavors, for those who like that. I love the bulgolgi - very homey, great flavor, goes perfectly with rice. Anything pork here I've tried is really good. The chicken though... the pieces are small cubes, but they taste very dry when chewed, and I don't like the texture. Sushi was not very memorable, so neither amazing nor awful I suppose, but I rarely get that here."}
{"text":"Oishii isn't fast food--it's good food, fast. I've stopped in for lunch on multiple occassions and enjoyed each menu item I've had. I'm partial to the rice bases of their bowls, but I've also tried a few of the bento boxes, sushi rolls, and the bi bim bap. Always receive my food in a few minutes with a smile to boot. 

I've never eaten on location, I always order to go, but the restaurant seemed cleaned albeit small! Price for lunch was always under $10 for me, usually around $7-8, so it wasn't something I'd buy every day. Portions are well worth the cost though. Great value over at Oishii."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is. I am a huge fan of Korean food and it's very hard to find takeout Korean in this city that is reasonably priced. Oishii has good portions, good prices, and most importantly the food is bomb. I usually opt for the beef bulgogi bento box. The beef is so tender and perfectly seasoned. When you combine it with onions and mushrooms its really an incredible dish. The sides are great, too. It usually comes with dumplings, some pickled radish, rice, and glass noodles. You also get kimchi or soup on the side. What a great place. I will be a frequent customer as long as I live here."}
{"text":"My go-to place to get my fix of Korean food when I need it the most. I think I've tried almost all of their bowls, bentos, and bibimbabs. Each order feels like about 2 servings so it's definitely a lot and will keep you full and satisfied. Definitely if you wanna treat yourself, go with the galbi or hwe-dup bab. Food here is not the cheapest but it's good food and fast. Getting take-out here is ideal bc seating can be very limited during the busy lunch and dinner hours. Don't forget that if you order food here, you can get 50¢ off a bubble tea order next door at Chicknbubbly! During the winter times, they have complementary warm barley tea they offer near the corner by all the condiments. 

Overall, can't say many bad things about this place because it just really is a convenient place to get Korean/Japanese food well made and fast."}
{"text":"Spicy pork spicy pork spicy pork!! I like this small clean restaurant, the sushi is fresh. spicy pork and galbi bento are my favorites, recommand"}
{"text":"I came by for lunch, ordered a rainbow roll and a seaweed salads to go. I waited for about 5-10 min before they were ready. The rainbow roll is soooo goooood that I ate them all. Now I'm too full to walk lol. The seaweed salad is good too. It has great texture just like all good seaweed salads do. But it is a little too salty for me."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but I feel like I can give this 5 stars.  I am not a pro on eating Korean food, so I have nothing to compare it to but I love it.  I have only gotten the bento boxes, one spicy pork and the other chicken katsu.  It is always a tough decision as to what to get.  

The service is quick and terrific also.  They might not be the nicest staff but they are efficient.  Whether super busy school year or less busy summer, they can churn out the food.  

Order anything and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"food was alright for a take-out asian fusion place. don't expect much authenticity, especially if you're looking for japanese food. the shumai were overpriced and tasted like pre-packaged frozen ones. the redeeming factor is that the portions were pretty big."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu bento and Galbi bento are my favorite. Oishii has the largest amount of meat with the cheapest price. I literally come here four times a week"}
{"text":"So pumped to have great Korean food in Pittsburgh. You order at a counter and they pack all the orders to go, not in numerical order or calling out your numbers. There's a bit of a waiting area near the counter, but there's upstairs seating.

I got the beef bulgolgi with an egg (50 cents more) with rice. It was a really generous portion, enough for two meals. I was surprised at how tender and flavorful the meat was, definitely not skimping there. There were also mushrooms in it, which I haven't experienced before. They also have free barley tea. Great food, no frills dining area, but would come again."}
{"text":"Their red heat roll is delicious!  it is a spicy California roll topped with tuna.  At 9 something after tax its worth it for a healthy tasty lunch.  It is quite beautiful too, but that's the raw tuna lover in me talking.  Sushi always amazes me because you know the fish were swimming in oceans thousands of miles away just two to three days ago!  Its always fresh at Oishii and sushi is a work of craft here (as it should be anywhere)!  
Idk how but i only realized recently that wasabi complements raw fish so perfectly, it elevates the sushi/sashimi experience to another level.  If you're wary of the fishiness of raw fish try extremely fresh fish with wasabi and soy sauce.  

It is unfortunate about this place that they use a lot of packaging and styrofoam and aren't environment friendly in that sense.  Maybe I'll suggest that they switch to real plates and such for their dine upstairs orders, I'm thinking it would be slightly more cost effective on their end as well.  
Sadly I'm always crossing my fingers and hoping their fish is sustainably harvested and I'm not participating in killing fish stocks around the world whenever I'm eating fish, but fish is healthy brain food with lots of omega-3 fatty acids!  

Their other dishes and bento boxes are great as well.  I particularly like their katsu don bowl, its one Japanese dish that i am obsessed with.  I will try it at any Japanese place I go to, the eggs and sauce are so delicious at a good place.  

For korean food the kalbi bento is good, I have a weakness for beef short ribs in any form.  The portion size is just ok, someone with a normal to big appetite might crave more after the meal but that's always kalbi for you."}
{"text":"My first time at Oishii, I had no clue what to order.  The people that worked there were very kind and helpful, and helped me choose.  I've been back several times, and gotten the bentos, bowls, and sushi.  I haven't tried any of the Korean food yet, but I will soon.  
The Oishii roll is very very good.  

The only downside to this place is seating, as I've been here on multiple occasions and had to take my food to go because there were no tables/chairs available."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Oishii I always get the chicken teriyaki bowl and it never fails to impress. It is the perfect portion, reasonably priced, and tastes absolutely incredible. The teriyaki sauce is not too overpowering but you can still taste its greatness. I would absolutely recommend this place. Great service, very attentive. One of my Oakland favorites."}
{"text":"The chicken and shrimp teriyaki bowl lacked flavor. It didn't taste like anything had any seasoning and the sauce wasnt thick so it didn't really add much. I didn't really find it to be worth $10 and I can't say I'd return."}
{"text":"Good Korean food is Pittsburgh is rare and usually expensive, but Oishii is the one exception. Get a bento for under $10 and it'll be full of really fresh, steaming rice, your choice of meat, and other side dishes like 2 fried dumplings and japchae. You also get a side of kimchi, salad, or miso soup with the bento. The wait can be long sometimes, especially at dinner time, but the food comes out pretty quickly. Oishii is more of a grab and go food place, but there are tables upstairs if you want to sit there. Whenever I crave Korean food in Pittsburgh, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Very sizable servings (esp. the rice bowls), for a good price. (This is one of the few restaurants where I sometimes can't finish my entire meal.) The food is tasty and the service is very friendly. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I wish I tried this place sooner! I've been wanting to try Oishii Bento for a long time but we always ended up going somewhere else instead. The prices here are incredibly reasonable, the food is to die for and the service is so quick. It's more of a take-out place, so the space is very small but there are a few tables upstairs if you'd like to dine in. I really like that there is a decent menu of Korean and Japanese dishes. My husband and I ordered the bulgogi bento and the chicken katsu bento, which were both delicious. The bento boxes included some gyoza, pickled radish, perhaps japchae, rice and the main entree. Oh, not to mention you get a choice of a side: soup, salad or kimchi. The bulgogi was a shredded beef that had a little sweetness. The katsu chicken was a (very large) breaded and fried chicken cutlet, with a tangy, savory sauce on top. Both were amazing and fresh. I like the bento boxes because you get a little variety but they also have bowls, which don't include the little extras. They also have a variety of sushi which I'm really excited to try during my next visit. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cheap, easy, and good.  I'd only give this place 3.5 stars based on the food, but the low prices make this a good enough value for 4 stars to be justified.  I had a tonkatsu bento, which came with a large helping of katsu (breaded, fried pork), rice, gyoza, kimchi, some noodles, and some other things I'm forgetting.  Everything was pretty good, and the quantity of food was pretty impressive considering it only cost about $8.  This seems like somewhere that would be great for lunch, although I'm sure it's good for a quick dinner too."}
{"text":"Great Korean food, delicious sushi, good portions. Call ahead at lunchtime or plan to wait a bit. A really nice family-owned business."}
{"text":"Oishii. My default spot when it comes to a great tasting, affordable meal on Pitt campus. Oishii is closed on sundays.. I am well aware of this because for whatever reason I always crave Oishii after church, ahh.. you want what you can't have (on Sundays).

KATSU-DON ($8.75): My go to. I just love the pork with the veggies and then the house broth makes the bowl not too dry, like the tonkatsu or the chicken katsu are. Some may think it is a little sweet, but when I come to Oishii, I'm getting the Katsu-Don 99% of the time.
SPICY PORK BOWL ($8.00): Also a great choice, with the pork and veggies all the same reddish color, it may not be the most prettiest dish, but it does have a kick of spiciness! If I'm in the mood for just a lotta pork and some fried onions in there too, this is what I'm getting. The portions are so generous here that I never feel like I'm wasting my money.
VEGETABLE TEMPURA ($7.25): For those times when I want to be fake healthy and eat veggies but they're fried. The fried zucchini and onions are meh, but the fried sweet potato is super delish! The tempura come with a sauce to dip in.

SEATING: Is very limited to like 3 chairs on the main floor and like 30-40 seats upstairs? So choose your dining time wisely, or just do take out! However they do have sriracha, soy sauce, barley tea, and water here if you do decide to stay.

SERVICE/WAIT-TIME: Probably at least 15 mins for your food to be made, they give you a number and you wait until it's called/ on their number system thingy in the upstairs. 
**Want to skip the wait? Call in beforehand and place an order via the phone and pick it up when you get there. Give them some time because this place is popular and they take their time making your yummy Korean food.

Not the cheapest option on campus, but I do think that most of the entrees are worth it. ~$10 for a bowl might seem a lot, but you actually get a lot of food to save for a second meal, otherwise you may fall into a food coma if you can eat it all in one sitting.."}
{"text":"yummy, cheap, fairly quick, and big portions!  Worth it if looking for a cheap lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming my favorite sushi place in Oakland. The sushi rice is soft and perfectly sticky, while their fish tastes like it was just caught an hour ago. I highly recommend their eel and octopus sushi, their sushi burrito, and their chicken bowl!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst... That would be my one sentence about this place. It's not the cleanest, or the freshest, or the best selection, but it's edible, and not even that bad. 

I think that this place is a little over priced and a little too dirty for me to go back to."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place if you want some affordable korean food. Prices aren't too bad, around $7-8 for a bento box. It's quality food, not overly greasy or fried. The bento boxes portions are huge, usually lasts me like two meals. There are more seatings upstairs if needed. 

My favorite thing there is the spicy pork bento box. Bento boxes come with your main protein, white rice, a little bit of clear noodles, 2 or 3 fried dumplings, a few slices of pickled yellow radish and your choice of miso soup or side salad. Miso soup tasted kind of bland, and salad had an interesting peanut sauce dressing. The spicy pork is a combination of spicy and sweet. If you like spicy food, I highly recommend the spicy pork bento. For those who want a smaller, healthier portion, I recommend any of the Bibimbap bowls. Again, I always get the spicy pork bibimbap bowl. It comes with your main protein, fresh chopped veggies, kimchi and a fried egg."}
{"text":"TLDR: A good restaurant to satisfy an Asian craving. Great value but not necessarily the most authentic food. The photo is of a Bulgogi bowl.

Oishii Bento is a great local establishment to get a quick fix of different iconic Asian meals. Although these dishes are not the most authentic, they are great value with their generous serving sizes. The ambiance and service is what you would expect from a restaurant that aims to serve customers quickly and affordably."}
{"text":"I've been here mostly for the sushi, which is cheap and decent enough for the price. I usually get take out and have only eaten lunch here once and it was crowded and we made it just in time to get a table so because of space, I'm not sure I'd recommend trying to eat in at lunch unless you go early. They only have the one sushi chef so sometimes there can be a wait but it's never too long. I like the red heat roll. I've also gotten their pork bipimbap and it was really good and defintiely a huge serving for the price. I can't comment on the authenticity at all but I'd definitely go back for their bowls."}
{"text":"Ah, Oishii Bento. It's a pretty decent place to eat - in fact I think they've improved over the years. I say this since I ate here as a student a couple times, and I remember not being super impressed by the sushi and thinking that one of the bowls I ordered wasn't that great. There just wasn't a lot of flavor or freshness in any of the meals I got back then.

These days the sushi at least is massively improved in my book. I picked up their Caterpillar roll and Red Heat roll to go recently and really liked both. The fish was of a reasonable quality even if it wasn't the freshest fish ever, and the topping and sauce combinations in both rolls were pretty tasty too. So while Oishii wouldn't make my admittedly snobbish list of the top 5 best sushi places, I do think they now offer reasonable and fairly tasty sushi options. 

Something I appreciate now that hasn't changed since I was a student is the prices. My latest meal cost a bit more than usual here but hey, I ordered two of their pricier rolls - what do you expect? It's reasonable to assume that a student ordering one roll or some sashimi and soup could get a good deal for their sushi fix. And I did get pretty large pieces of sushi in my last order, so at least I got what I paid for quantity wise.

Granted, it took a long time to get the food, but I did stop in during their dinner rush. Eating and picking up food anywhere in Oakland during the student dinner rush takes a long time. Oishii is admittedly one of the smaller places you could hit up for some grub, so during the dinner rush in particular there's practically no room for the crowd that gathers downstairs that's ordering and getting their food. I remember that there's an upstairs dining area that was pretty \"meh\" - it's a place to sit but it's not exactly a fine dining area.

I'm giving them 3 stars since I can't quite say \"yay I'm a fan!\" and I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat at Oishii - but hey, the food is decent and I'd consider stopping in again in a pinch, so that's worth an a-ok in my book!"}
{"text":"For some reason, on the day I came here, I was really biased and just really wanted salmon wherever I went so I ordered the salmon bento. The salmon itself wasn't too bad, although I can tell it was probably frozen and recooked or something. The sauce wasn't too salty but it just tasted like soy sauce. The bento was worth its value and I would definitely recommend this place for its bentos. As for the sushi, I haven't tried it because they looked too big and \"plastic-y\". The place is definitely more \"fast food\" than \"restaurant\" but it's nice how they give you your order directly even while you're sitting upstairs."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey for what it is -- that it to say, a quick sit-down/to-go type joint crowded with students. The bf and I ordered a bento box each, the oishi roll and a spicy salmon roll. The damage? About $30+. 

The rundown: the spicy pork was decent (but this is pretty hard to mess up), the chicken katsu was forgettable, the oishi roll was pretty good, and the spicy salmon, again, not very memorable. 

We'll probably be back again, but I've definitely had better and for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"If there was only one place I could eat food from in Oakland, this would be it. The seating is cramped but I only ever get take out from here anyway. They usually have a barley tea for folks waiting. The bento lunches are great, my go-to is the chicken katsu bento, which in addition to the panko crusted chicken cutlet comes with two gyoza style fried dumplings, two pickled daikon slices, and a small side of noodles, along with sticky rice and miso soup. A bento lunch will run you around $10 without a drink. There's a lot of worse options out there for that price."}
{"text":"The bento boxes are huge servings for the price, which is the only thing I've had on the menu. The restaurant is small and cute, and the service is very nice. The food was very hot, and good, although not amazingly so. The salad didn't have enough dressing on it.

We were expecting Japanese food, though the menu appears to be half Korean at least. The drinks are cans of soda, and they serve Pepsi productts only. Also, they only take Visa/Mastercard - no Discover or American Express."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Pittsburgh for its price! Nothing fancy, just a nice hot serving of bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, galbi...just to list a few. Many other options to choose from, like sushi or udon noodles. 

Tiny place where you order and pick up once your number is called (a few seats upstairs). This is not the place to go if you want all those fancy Korean dishes. 

Plus if you want bubble tea, take the receipt from here and go right next door for a nice bubble tea and get 50 cent off!

Again, want fast and simple but hot and delicious Korean food?! Don't need to look any further!!"}
{"text":"Great bento boxes and kimchi. Good prices. Not really a sit down restaurant but there is some limited seating upstairs."}
{"text":"For a Korean bento box place, it hit the spot.  

My son and I arrived in Pittsburgh from San Diego and were hungry.  My son ordered the bulgogi bento box so I ordered the same.  I was thinking about ordering the fire box which looked like a spicy sushi bento box but it was too pricy.  

We went upstairs to their dining area.  They had those Korean style order number systems that I have seen in Korean department stores food courts like shinsaegae.  

Food came out.  It was very delicious.  The meat was very tasty and small bite size.  There was sliced cooked onions which enhanced the taste.  It also included mandoo (fried), white rice and chapchae but a little bit.  

The price was good.  

I think the owners also run the next door chicken and boba place so they gave a 50 cent discount coupon on the receipt.  

We had a  honeydew slushies and I had strawberry.  Without the boba- we are not fans of the boba, but I am sure others like them.

Both of these places had clean area and friendly service."}
{"text":"The food is good and can be ready within 5 to 10 minutes for to go orders. I recommend the bulgogi. Kimchi is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Their meat selection might be better cooked than the vegeterian ones. I once had a vegetable bibimbap, and honestly i think they just throw the veggies haphazardly into a plastic bowl, give you a cup of red bean paste and call it a meal. And one more reason why i give this a 3 instead of 4 is because they always use plastic utensils, bowls, plates, bento.... and then put that in a plastic bag Even when you dine in. I mean, they have dish washers, theres no need to be that lazy, plus harming the environment, hello?"}
{"text":"Great tasting food, but a bit more than what I have been used to paying. Even though the name of the restaurant is Japanese, we ended up getting a couple of their Korean items. I really wanted to try their ribs dish that lots of reviewers referenced, but spending 11.95 for a lunch just didn't seem right to me. So yes, they have one menu for the whole day (e.g. no lunch menu).

If I took out the price factor, since I am not Pittsburgh/Oakland cost of living knowlegeable, then I likely would have given the four stars if they were in alignment...but I didn't see anythwhere else that supported a higher cost of living than the Denver area, so integrating that in...results in a 3 star rating.

So the food..,we got the bulgolgi and bibenbop both weremade with great ingredients and flavor. Service was so-so. However I was there around 3 in the afternoon so they were busy doing other stuff I guess. There were no real tables to sit at, so we took it somewhere else to eat (really small place). Great for college kids on the go."}
{"text":"Love this place- I always want to get something new but I can't resist the beef bibimbap.  Sushi is delicious too.  You can also order the super awesome Korean  crunchy chicken wings next door (they own that too) and eat it upstairs."}
{"text":"I go to this place often. I really like it because they give you a lot of food and also they make it pretty fresh. And it taste pretty authentic"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a fast Korean fix in Pittsburgh. The bulgogi or spicy pork bento boxes come with a complete Korean meal reminiscent of cafeteria food in Korea. The galbi is good too but more expensive. Their bibimbap and sushi are great too. Crowded at times and the seating is tight so I usually get it to go."}
{"text":"I love the bulgogi bowl! This is a takeout place, but there is a seating area upstairs. The service has always been a little slow, but I don't mind waiting for my food here since it's so good. Portions are pretty generous."}
{"text":"Spicy Pork Bento (ask for it extra spicy). That's all you need to know.

Everything else here is so-so. The tonkatsu would probably be my second favorite. Thankfully, the spicy pork is good enough to warrant 4 stars. One of my go-to dinners around Oakland."}
{"text":"A bit pricier compared to the other Asian restaurants on the street but the quality is definitely higher and worth the price. Most people order either a bento or a bowl dish. None of these options are bad and the food is good. The place is lacking in the sushi department though and it's pretty cramped so takeout is a good option."}
{"text":"Oishii is my favorite food place in Oakland!! Service is always great and the food is absolutely amazing. Never disappoints. I definitely recommend the chicken teriyaki bowl as well as the shrimp tempura roll and spicy tuna roll. Owned by such nice, kind people, oishii is my go to every night!"}
{"text":"Oishii is not a sushi bar that some of you might be used to. So if you ar looking to try different types of sushi, it might be better to go somewhere else. However, if you are craving good sushi at a very reasonable price then this is the place to go. 

I would highly recommend the oishii rolls and the galbi bento (if you like ribs).

It is located on the University of Pittsburgh campus so you would be sure to bump into a lot of students."}
{"text":"Just tried the place for lunch at 11:45 for the first time. Staff was very helpful to explain the menu and offer recommendations. Its a small place and it gets crowded quickly, but the orders roll out fast. I ordered the Beef bulgogi, it was great! A very good sized portion I might add. The beef and sauce and mushrooms had great flavor and didn't need any seasoning, the goyzas were delicious. Very good value just get there early so you have a place to site down."}
{"text":"All three stars are being awarded for the cheap lunch price.  I got the six piece spicy tuna roll for $5.00.  In college town you've got to have dirt cheap prices to stay a float. 

Would I go back to Oishii Bento if I could go to Sushi and Rolls prehaps no?  The roll was mostly rice with some pale orange mayo....that was not very tasty.  The roll was mostly avocado and I couldn't taste my tuna with my mouth full of avocado.  The avocado may have been listed in the discription of the roll and I could have over looked it.  I just wanted more fish and a lot less avocado. 

I did like that the menu is mounted on the wall and it's three vertical flat screens, that was a nice touch.

I just wasn't too happy with my sushi lunch, I'd rather add an extra $4.00 and get something worthwhile somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Affordable, filling, and satisfying for the college student. I like their rice bentos and ton katsu."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place in Pittsburgh -- it's reasonably priced, and the food quality is high. I've been coming here for years, and actually prefer it to all but the priciest sushi places in town. I'd recommend the red heat roll, caterpillar roll, California rolls, unagi bowl, and spicy pork bowl. I pretty much bounce around those options with some inari thrown in once in a while. They also have great party platters which are a good deal for three or more people.

My only complaint is with the wasteful takeout packaging which is used (to a lesser extent) even for eat in meals. Lots of plastic and, if you eat in, styrofoam goes to waste. I'd love to see actual dishes, or at least more thought put in to how much packaging is really required. How about adding a recycling bin at the minimum?"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot on Pitt's campus. I usually always get the galbi bento, it's so much food, fast, and delicious. Not sure if they make their kimchi but it's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Holy Bento, I'm so glad I decided to try this place out! 

I absolutely adore bento boxes and sushi, but I had to try the Japanese Burrito... Ever since I found out that sushiritos are a thing, I've been searching for a place in Pittsburgh that makes them!
It was everything I had hoped for, such a great combination of flavors with spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, avocado, and more.

My one caution is that if you go at regular lunch hours, you WILL have a bit of a wait, and you'll probably have a hard time getting a seat. The small seating area upstairs fills up fast!

Still so worth it!"}
{"text":"Lucky review #100! Oishii Bento is a great spot for quick, reasonably priced, and delicious food in the heart of Oakland. It's way bigger than it looks because of the upstairs, so while I usually take it to go, there's definitely enough room to sit down as long as it isn't a crazy lunch rush, which a few other reviews have mentioned as well. 

The guys running the place are really nice too! I'll be back again very soon as always."}
{"text":"OMG Let me just say it.

Get the Galbi bento (if you're a beef eater). You will not regret it.

If you're a vegetarian, the bibimbap is pretty good too. 

Like sushi/sashimi, try the hwedopbap. It's a little bit on the spicy side, so make sure that the sauce is on the side (it usually is anyways)."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out this place because of all the rave reviews. I went with a couple people and we all liked what we got. One of my friends is Korean and he goes there often, so to me, that's a good sign. 

There's not much ambiance, but we were getting stuff to-go anyways. We waited about 10ish minutes during the evening. I got the bulgogi bento. It didn't look like much, but I ended up having some leftover bulgogi so I guess I would describe the serving size as generous. I wasn't super impressed by the food, but it was tasty and I'd go back some time as it's a good balance of speedy take-out and freshly made food that tastes authentic and flavorful."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch bento of spicy bulgolgi, side of kimchi, side of noodles, pickled veggies, two dumplings, and a large serving of rice. The bulgolgi had little to no gristle or fat. The kimchi was spicy and very flavorful(usually places over do it on the bean paste). I ordered take out and it was fairly fast. Definitely going to be a lunch staple for me."}
{"text":"Korean owed restaurant with a Japanese name. My favorite lunch spot in Oakland. Bulgogi bibimbap/ spicy pork bento are my two favorites. Not a fan of their sushi though."}
{"text":"Make sure you order in advance for pick up! It's a bit of a wait and there isn't a lot of space to wait for your food. Everything is pretty expensive, $8+ for anything that comes as a meal, $4+ for sushi. I came here last year, ordering a chicken teriyaki bowl, katsu bento, bimbibap, but this year the quality has gone down. 

I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl, around 7:30pm, but I've always ordered when they were busy. The quality was always good but this time my vegetables were sparse and still a bit raw. The rice was still super soft and the teriyaki sauce was good. The chicken was a bit bland. My friend ordered the bimbibap and she was also missing vegetables and her rice was hard. 

I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. The quality isn't consistent and it's a bit pricy."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's hard to get decent Korean food around CMU/UPitt, and I feel like this is probably one of the best ones around.  It's very accessible in Oakland, and there is a small parking lot next to it (metered).

I only get one thing here: The bulgogi bento.  It costs under $10, and you get the kimchi or salad along with sides of Korean clear noodles (SO GOOD), some fried dumplings, and those yellow carrot things.  The bulgogi has a lot of onions though (which is fine).  And I am obsessed with Oishii salad.  Weird I know, but I think it's some sort of sesame or ginger dressing (forgot), but it's very good.  I've gotten the udon here before, but it's kind of bland.  So, bulgogi it is!

It's kind of hard to find seating during busy hours because both upstairs and downstairs there isn't much seating area.  You can get free water upstairs too.

I love this place and I'm going to miss it when I leave CMU!"}
{"text":"Slow food served fast. Good quality and quantity for the price. It is definitely a perfect place for college students who are hungry and want their food immediately at a cheap price. Bibimbab comes out the quickest. I would like to recommend the spicy pork bento, chicken teriyaki bowl, and oishii roll if you are visiting for the first time. Everything is in a take-out system and the place itself is quite small. It may not seem like a family-friendly place to dine-in but I've seen many families come and sit for the food as well."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, btw it's basically right across from UPMC Presby, the whole street of Asian restaurants are right there!

This place had a great atmosphere. There were Koreans and Asians everywhere, and that's when you know it's good. 
Everything comes in takeout containers, and you can go upstairs to eat. 

I got the bulgolgi bento box. It had chapchae, rice, 2 fried mini dumplings, kimchi, and BULGOLGI. Also comes w a side of salad or soup (I think)
It was delicious. It was hot, and tasted like home cooked Korean food. 

I approve and will definitely be back 
(Also, you can get $0.50 off any BUBBLE TEA (YESSS) next door at Chicken Bubbly!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to stop before my evening class. They have a nice selection of meals and snacks. I like getting a small order of Shumai, a small roll, or inari as a pre-class snack. The food comes out quickly, is very affordable, and always tasty! They also have free self serve barley tea which is a big plus when it's chilly out, and really warms you up! 

For meals, they have great rice bowls that are a generous serving and pretty well balanced. I like the chicken teriyaki bowl, all of the bento boxes, and the udon! They have some seating downstairs and a bunch of tables upstairs, so you're good to eat in or take away. Also with your receipt, you can get 50c off at Chick n Bubbly next door! Get some bubble tea to wash down the meal :)"}
{"text":"Sushi for lunch is healthish right? obsessed with their sushi burrito!!!! 

Wow! I would never have thought this little sushi place would be this good!

I think it is very creative and interesting when it comes to there meals and specialty rolls... I've seen their menu a \"Sushi Burrito\" ! um hell yeah i'm gonna order that! it was so yummy and filling...just eating ONE roll and i'm good till dinner....they put a good amount of fish in their sushi...which makes everything extra yummy...they have complementary hot tea...which goes great with your meals! i would definitely come back and try their Korean food!"}
{"text":"Everything you can get here is delicious. Some of the freshest tasting sushi I've had and the prices are really reasonable. I always get the spicy pork bowl! Only downside is sometimes it takes long to get your food but that's only because it's always so busy. Love love love oishii"}
{"text":"Korean Food in oakland... Didn't have this when i was living in Pittsburgh. Ordered the katau don $7.50 and 6 pieces of sushi $9.25 for lunch... There isn't much seating downstairs. But the place has plenty of customers which is a good sign. The katau don was ok, but without the rich tasty brown gravy thy i am used to also the pork was a bit bland. 

The sushi was good, but the tuna and salmon was previously frozen it seemed. Which was only noticeable because of how cold it was.  The eel was the best I have had in quite awhile. Also the sushi was hard to eat since the rice kept falling apart. 

All in all, a decent spot, but they has allot of work to so to catch up with Korea Town in NYC"}
{"text":"Great place if you want authentic cheap Korean food. Their bimbimbap is the best I've had yet and I'm a big fan of their bulgolgi even though I don't really like red meat! Their rainbow roll is really delicious too- there's really nothing bad you can order here!"}
{"text":"The only words you need to know is \"Spicy Pork Bugogi Bowl\"

mmk? It's delicious; it's filling; it's served piping hot and spicy hot.  Great bowl of rice with heaps of pork that's coated in a red hot sauce with sauteed onions.  YUM.

Only gripe: A little $$, minimal seating, and long long LONG waits at lunch.

Otherwise...go get the pork."}
{"text":"Ambiance: small place, but theres more seating upstairs.. seems like a lot of college kids come by here.. I just stopped by for lunch after visiting the carnegie museums

Service: food was ready in a few minutes.. they put up your order number and you pick it up at the counter when its ready

Food: the bulgogi bowl is awesome.. perfect for a cold day.. not too spicy but very flavorful"}
{"text":"Today was the perfect day to try Oishii Bento! I needed something quick due to the amount of errands I had to run. I have never tried Korean, but I knew exactly what I wanted to try based on recommendations from friends and family. I walked right up to the register and ordered my Bulgogi Bento that included a side of rice, 2 little potstickers that were fried, jap chae, and kimchi. After 10 minutes my order was ready and I was outta there! I did notice a sign for extra seating upstairs but this is definitely not a place for large parties. Also, if you are in the mood for bubble tea take your receipt next door to chickn' bubbly for 50 cents off! 

I couldn't wait to get home to eat my meal, it smelled amazing and by no surprise it tasted amazing too! I was really pleased with how much food you get for the price. I believe the price was around $9.63 and that ended up being two meals for me because my leftovers are now in the refrigerator. I cannot wait to come back and take my parents along with me! Next time I would like to try the Bibimbab or Galbi Bento."}
{"text":"I always get their bubolgi bowl because it's so good and filling. I'd go here for a quick and un-fancy lunch meal. If you're looking for good sushi I'd try elsewhere."}
{"text":"been here since my sophomore year at Pitt. The food is really good, but the wait can be long during busy hours, and they sometimes forgot my orders, I waited nearly an hour only to find out that the order is not in yet, so if you waited for a long time, and they haven't call your number, you better off asking the front desk about it."}
{"text":"I think my taste buds either got picky or the quality if my most recent visit went down.  But I'm mostly annoyed that they didn't get my order right... Especially if I told them no green onions at least three times."}
{"text":"I ate here twice a week (at least) for the 8 years I lived in Pittsburgh. There's nothing you can order that will disappoint, and this is the best place in the city for sushi. It's a small place, but I've never had a problem finding seating if I wanted it. It's great for takeout, but I would recommend calling in your order as sometimes there can be a bit of a wait. The pricing is perfect, and the quality in unbeatable. If you frequent this restaraunt, don't be surprised if the staff remember you and your favorite dish. They greet every customer with a smile and they will thank you as you leave (I'm not kidding)."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the sushi since I've never had it but I can say that this is a pretty good place to go if you want lunch for the bento boxes or for carry out. They have seats upstairs so that's at least nice. I think a huge thing I would have to say is if you plan on getting anything with katsu, I would STRONGLY suggest that you get the sauce on the side. The sauce is super salty and the tonkatsu or chicken katsu will be over sauced if you just have them put it on directly. I got it once that way and totally regret it since I could only eat half of the serving. I just couldn't stomach the excess sauce. The next time I got it on the side, it was much better and you could taste the crispiness of the chicken.

Their bento boxes are pretty reasonable and while I would say the miso soup is a bit sub par, I would say everything else is pretty good eats."}
{"text":"Delicious and decently priced! Every place I've ever ordered bulgogi from comes with a higher price tag. But the price and portion sizes here were great! I couldn't believe how much I got for how much I paid. I'll definitely be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"My wife, brother, and I stopped in for dinner while in town for my cousin's wedding and were thrilled with our food. We shared a sushi plate (yellow tail and salmon), which was amazing. Really fresh and flavorful. Our group also had an order of the pork bibimbab and two bowls--a beef and a katsu don. All of them were fantastic. The flavors were unique and meshed well together and just tasted great. Food was served up quickly (its mostly a take away place, but there is a small seating area upstairs) and with a smile. And its cheap--all our food came to only $38 plus tip. Outstanding! This is a must stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"When you first arrive at Oishii, your first thoughts are how pretty the sign is! Once you get inside, you'll find the interior is similarly colorful and cozy. They offer free barley tea (at least when I went, during the cold weather) and display their menu on large screens. When you order at the register, checkout is easy and friendly! After ordering, you're basically on your own -- everything from setting up your food at your table to cleaning up after is done by the customers, so it's definitely a more casual than sit-down place.

I came here with a friend during dinner hours and we went upstairs, where there's much more seating than downstairs -- the street level is really more for the ordering process rather than dining. We sat at a table, which was a little dirty, but I think that's just because we must have sat down right after another left -- we saw employees wiping down other tables pretty thoroughly. The place was definitely full as well.

The process of ordering was pretty organized! Once we were upstairs, there was a digital sign that dinged whenever an order was ready and displayed the order number. Once you pick up your food, you're ready to dig in!

I got the Bulgogi Bento Box with Kimchi, which is pretty popular, and I could taste why. They were pretty generous with the meat, gave a good amount of rice, and all the food in the box was delicious! There was enough for a full meal (or, if you're a smol person like me, enough for leftovers) and the bento comes in a disposable container that's easy to stow away in the fridge. The bento cost $10, which isn't cheap for a college student, but it's a nice meal to get every once in a while and arguably worth the money, considering how sparse Korean food is in Pittsburgh. 

Overall, the atmosphere was cozy and casual, the employees were friendly, and the food was pretty good! Originally from an area where Asian food -- and in particular, Korean food -- is prevalent, I'd say the taste was pretty spot on, and worth the money for an occasional splurge."}
{"text":"Affordable and amazing. I have been around the sushi block and this is some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh. I can't speak to the other food items, but the sushi is fresh and just as good as it would be in any expensive restaurant. The only difference with Oishii is there are less elaborate choices (ex. I love crunchy sushi but they don't offer that). Another note, there is only a small seating area upstairs - which has water and is always clean."}
{"text":"My bf was in the mood for sushi. We've been eating at the same place for sushi for 4 years. I wanted to try something different. I looked up sushi places via yelp and noticed Oishii Bento had a gerat mix of reviews and a nice menu.

My boyfriend went with Lion King Roll which is: shrimp & smoked salmon over a smoke salmon tempura roll (8pc/$9.50) It was delicious! I am not a fan of salmon fillets but this roll was great! I loved the sauce on top. He also ordered the Catapiller Roll which is: eel, avocado over a California roll (8pc/$11.50)

I went with a Chicken Teriyaki Bento. It has chicken & mixed veggies plus white rice. For sides they gave me 2 dumplings and rice noodles. 

The food was great and it came out quick. I'm excited to head back for the lion king roll!"}
{"text":"Oishii is definitely one of my favorite places (and one of the only places) to go on campus for Korean/Japanese cuisine. I frequently order the bento boxes, specifically the spicy pork bento and chicken katsu. The katsu is sometimes as dry and rough as the chopsticks you're eating it with, but it varies every time I go. The vegetable udon and gyoza that come with the bento are all really good. For me, the bento is enough for about 1.5 meals, but I also eat very little so I can see some people complaining about the quantity of food--back at home, I'd order bento from H-Mart for about the same price and it would come with much more of everything.
I've also had the spicy pork bowl, which was good but not as flavorful as I expected it to be. It was definitely spicy, but not much else. 
I still really like Oishii because it's probably one of the best places to go for Asian food in the area. Service is quick and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I was not wowed by this place. It is a confusing structure for a restaurant, and it's never clear whether you order first and go sit, or order and then stand and wait, or what. Even if you figure out exactly how to get food, it is not really worth getting. The sushi is especially appalling--definitely avoid it at all costs. The rice bowls are not so bad, for fast food...but I wouldn't come here again unless I was starving."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant by Oakland standard. I got bulgogi udon but the bulgogi in there seemed more like ground rather than sliced beef. It still tasted good but wasn't entirely what I expected. The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"I can honestly say the food was tasty, the portion plentiful, and the location excellent. but I had a few issues.  I think the place could be a little cleaner/neater.  I wouldn't mind a bit more atmosphere.  It was not simple due to design choices but more or less for budget reasons.  The girl at the register was irritated with our lack of knowledge of the menu.  Hey girl, it was our first time in the place and it's not a strictly Japanese or Korean cuisine.  It is a mash up.  I felt like we were bugging the girl at the register.  She seemed really bored and would rather be anywhere else but there.  That didn't deter us from ordering and it was very flavorful food.  I had the a shrimp and scallop dish with vegetables while my son had chicken teriyaki.  When we were leaving, the cook/owner was sitting in the waiting area; he thanked us for our business.  I would go back for the food but not for anything else.  I think takeout is an excellent choice for next time."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, the last time being awhile ago.  The first time, I ordered one of the noodle dishes; the second, I ordered a bento box, and the third, I ordered some of the sushi (salmon roll w/ cream cheese).  Each time, the food was pretty fresh, and my orders came out fairly quickly.  I've always sat upstairs to eat.  They serve a variety of Asian food, including Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.  The prices are very reasonable.  Given the price, quickness, and location, this is a great place for people from Pitt and Presby to grab lunch."}
{"text":"Small and comfortable Asian fusion place that serves a variety of signature Korean and Japanese dishes. Their menu includes sushi, different Korean meat \"bowls\" (small, under $10) and \"bentos\" (larger, over $10), appetizers, and noodles like udon. 

The food itself is quite good, despite not really having the feeling of an authentic Korean or Japanese meal. I've had the bulgogi, spicy pork, and bibimbap, and each had a good combination of ingredients and sauces. The bulgogi and spicy pork bowl only comes with onions and mushrooms for vegetables, but both have a fair portion of meat; I've found the spiciness level of the pork to vary. The bibimbap is a fair replication of the more traditional dish which comes and is made in a stone bowl. They also serve galbi, terikayi, and katsu dishes.

The ambience is set up for efficiency (probably catering to the students). You order at the counter and you wait maybe up to 10 minutes for your food, at which point you can take it upstairs and hope that there's seating, which may sometimes be lacking during busy hours. On the bright side, there's no need to tip!"}
{"text":"Although the block of Oakland between Forbes and 5th is littered with \"Asian\" restaurants, most look dubious at best. Oishii is the sole exception. This clean and cheerful Korean/Japanese eatery serves solid lunch boxes efficiently at a reasonable price.  

The bentos and bowls run for about $7. They are generously portioned and contain a good mix of flavors, making for a satisfying quick meal. I am less sure if it'd be worthwhile to get the sushi here. I suspect better quality-to-price deals can be scored elsewhere. I recommend the bibimbap.

Overall, I think the food quality is probably more in the range of 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because it is vastly superior to most other Asian fast-food options in Oakland."}
{"text":"Oishii has some pretty good food for reasonable prices. I always liked the teryaki bowl, but I have tried the Oishii roll, which is really good, too."}
{"text":"Great lunch food! I especially like the spicy pork bulgogi--a generous portion and lots of flavor. Maybe not the best thing to eat on a hot summer day (the spiciness will overheat you for sure) but it sure tastes good. Lunchtime is crowded and loud, but not unpleasantly so."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Oishii! It's quick and easy on the wallet, great for a quick dinner or lunch. The place itself is small and it looks like there's nowhere to sit but they have a whole upstairs area with tables and cushion-seat counter. 

I got a bulgogi bento box here that came with a miso soup and sides of kimchi, pickled radish and glass noodles - all for under $10! We also got a spicy tuna roll, it still wasn't spicy and the rice wasn't very packed but for being $4 or so, I wasn't complaining."}
{"text":"Used to come here once a week during my days at Pitt.  Have to say it has some of the best food on Pitt campus.  

Bulgogi Bowl is solid. Can't go wrong there, though I often went for something else. My wife's favorite.

Spicy pork bowl is my go-to lunch. Spicy, juicy. 

Unagi Bowl used to be my dinner go-to till I figured that the eel is likely overpriced. I highly doubted that the eels were made in-house.  I dont blame them for it.  I just think there are cheaper options for the same taste.  Correct me if I am wrong.

My \"feel-good\" dinner go-to is \"Galbi Bento\".  I do think that their short ribs (bone-in) is one of the best in town. It is on the expensive-side of their menu. It's ~$15 dinner with sides, plus soup or kimchi.  

Hwe Dup Bap is Korean style raw fish with rice.  It comes with lots of greens, diced raw fish (tuna & salmon).  Instead of wasabi, it comes with a spicy sauce to mix.  It's ok.  My better-half likes it, I prefer my galbi bento.

Only complain, I had Oishii Udon once for take-out.  The shrimp tempura started absorbing the broth and became soft.  They should have thought of it and placed the tempura in a second container.  Never tried in the house.

Overall, good price and taste for a campus food stop.  There is a help-yourself clean-up yourself dining area upstairs.  5* for campus food."}
{"text":"Great food. Strange seating, but the price is right."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Just a small takeout place.  Their Korean food is really good not sure how fresh their sushi are.  Fast place always a lineup. Its cheap and good."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive option that is consistently great. 

I am in love with the bento dishes and the bowls. For the amount of food they give you...$8 is a steal. My favorite is the Spicy Pork and Donkatsu bentos: a huge portion of meat, 2 dumplings, pickled radishes, jap chae (vermicelli), and rice? All equally tasty! Who knew that Korean food could be so affordable?

Your best bet for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Had two rolls from Oishii Bento today for lunch.  Sushi was very fresh and had great taste.  Called ahead and it was ready when I got there from the office.  I will be back next time I am in the Oakland area."}
{"text":"I always leave this place smelling of teriyaki.  Every time.  I sit at my desk and wonder why it smells like Oishii in my cubicle.  

Anyhow, I could think of worse things to smell like, because OISHII is delicious!  Get there early (before noon) on a week day or else you will have to take your food to go.  The upstairs fills up fast.  The teriyaki bowls are quite good, and enough food for 2 meals really.  If you go for the bento, it comes with a kyoza and salad and some pickled item that I don't really ever eat because I don't like pickled things.  The ginger salad dressing is really good.  A tad grainy, but has good flavor.  Also, this is one of my favorite places for sushi.  

One of my favorite places in Oakland!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Perfect for the hungry college student. My favorites are the Ton-katsu bento and Bibimbap. Because they go for quantity, cheapness, and speed the food is cold sometimes but still good. Lines are long during lunchtime and seating is limited but you can always find a nice place to eat around the Pitt campus."}
{"text":"Right next door to Chick'n Bubbly! (In case you want a bubble tea while you wait.)

Asian fusion. Spoiled for choices. Fast, affordable and delicious. Haven't had anything here I didn't like. Try the Katsu Don."}
{"text":"Black clouds filled the sky, thunder rumbling in the distance. Or was that my stomach? I was running low on energy and knew it wouldn't be long before I was completely spent. I needed sustenance and Sushi Boat was going to provide it to me. I left my respective place of sanctuary and hit a desperate lurching walk up the street. It wouldn't be long now. Just a little further. As I turned the corner and saw the unlit store front, I knew all hope was lost. I ran towards the store and pounded on the glass, screaming, begging to be serviced. But it was of no use. It was closed down and I was poop out of luck. The Boat had failed me. I fell to my knees as the strength left my legs and closed my eyes, visions of Buffalo Chicken Rolls and other traditional Chinese cuisine dancing before my eyes as I slowly drifted into unconsciousness...

...I awoke to the sound of laughter, drifting lazily towards me, and cautiously opened one eye. Across the street, standing out starkly against the inky black of night, was a brightly lit window topped by a glowing neon sign. I tried to make out the name. Oishii Bento? I made my way across the dimly lit street and opened the door into a world of light and colors. Inside were several large screens flashing ads in Chinese, a kindly looking woman in traditional garb standing behind the register, and a group of schoolchildren standing off to one side, chatting about Dota or drifting in some Oriental dialect. It appeared I had somehow been transported to China. Was this a vision or some cruel quantum mishap?? I didn't know, but I did know that I needed to eat, and fast. I approached the counter and ordered the \"Teriyaki Chicken Bowl\" and the \"Philadelphia Roll\" (both traditional Chinese dishes) and took a seat. After several minutes, my meal was ready. I took my bag from the kind old women and used what little Chinese I knew. \"Cao!\" I said, using the Chinese word for \"Thank you\" and walked towards the door, smiling to myself as I thought about what that old woman would think about the polite, young Westerner who had magically appeared in her little store. The stories she would tell! Then I stepped out the door...

...and suddenly I was back in Oakland! I gasped, the harsh city air filling my lungs with the toxins they had become so accustomed to. Was I dreaming? I spun around, but the restaurant was gone. Yes, a dream then. Nothing more. Then I looked down. I was still holding the bag of steaming food. Dumbfounded, I sat down there in the middle of the street and ate the best ******* meal of my life, silverware and all. Later in the life, doctors would tell me I had experienced what is commonly referred to as a psychotic breakdown, that I'd imagined it all. And sometimes I agree. But deep down, I know that the kind Chinese woman and the Oishii Bento shop are just off somewhere helping someone else like me. Maybe we could have been together. In another time, another place. But not here..... Not now.

{"text":"Oishii Bento is a great place! 

Pros: Everything I've eaten there has been very tasty, my favorite thing on the menu being the Japanese burrito! The staff has always been very friendly. 

Cons: Seating is very limited here, there's just a few tables upstairs and nowhere to sit outside. Sometimes during the lunch hours it can get super busy and take a little long for me to get my food, which is completely understandable but sometimes I've had to wait for quite a bit.

Other than those few small things I think this is a wonderful restaurant that I am always happy to go back to."}
{"text":"Their best roll is the oishii.  It's probably my favorite roll in the Pittsburgh area.  The place is reasonably priced and the food overall is of a high quality.  It's a VERY casual place, however and it's located near the University of Pittsburgh in Oakland.  Parking can be a little tough, but there is a small metered parking lot near by."}
{"text":"Great food for the price and perfect for when you are busy/on the go. I lived on this stuff in college!"}
{"text":"Came in on a rainy day and this place is great! The food is so fresh and the portions are big. Definitely bang for your buck. Got the teriyaki chicken bento and it came with glass noodles, pickled radish, gyoza and miso soup in the side. Really worth it! It lasted me three days. The flavor is great, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was seriously craving some Korean food, so I'm super overjoyed that this place exists! I went on a weekend trip with a couple friends to Pittsburgh and we decided to stop here for lunch. The place is a little small, and really great for takeout, but they do have an upstairs area for seating. Service is polite and friendly.

They offer a variety of different foods, from bento boxes to bulgogi or galbi bowls, to bibimbap, pot stickers, or even sushi!

I went for the bulgogi bowl, because it has been ages since I've had one. (It was absolutely delicious.) My friend ordered bibimbap with beef, and since she couldn't finish it and I'm the resident food receptacle amongst my friends, I got to have that too, and it was equally as wonderful. :] (Portions are awesome, but I just eat a lot, haha.)

The prices are reasonable, and food is ready fairly quickly. They give you a receipt with an order number when you place your order, and you can either stay downstairs to wait, or sit upstairs until your number comes up on the screen. (We went on a Saturday afternoon, and the wait wasn't bad at all.

(I love the hot barley tea in the corner by the window!)

$5 minimum for credit card purchases, and you get a discount if you take in your receipt to get bubble tea next door!"}
{"text":"Just a short walk from Presbyterian Hospital is the small \"Oishii Korean and Japanese style lunchbox\". 

I was greeted as soon as I stepped into the restaurant and there was no line at 10 minutes to noon.

There are so many interesting dishes on the menu including bento, udon and rice bowls. I was craving sushi on this warm day so I ordered a salmon avacado roll ($5) and seaweed salad ($3). The roll is beautiful and delicious. Everything is fresh! An equal amount of fish & avocado is in each piece, which is a sizeable mouthful. The sushi rice has nice flavor so you don't need soy sauce imho. The wasabi paste is not weak! The seaweed salad smells fresh, has the lovely crunch that I crave and is a nice portion. 

Overall a great experience and at great price you know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yummy box is a good description for this place. I don't know where else you can get a substantial Korean-inspired bento box for $7. This place is the chinese take-out of korean bento boxes, and it's a great alternative when you want take-out, and I bet it would be a good lunch spot. I wouldn't head here for a sit-down dinner. 

Overall, this is a surprise treat for take-out food."}
{"text":"Decent Korean restaurant. Yes it's Korean not Japanese.
Was one of my go-to after class dining place back when I was a student. I always get either bolgogi bento or calbi.

Beware of your stinky burp after eating though... A lot of onions... You don't wna go kiss your date after eating here for sure.

Price okay, nice people."}
{"text":"** Affordable Korean and Japanese food that tastes authentic and great sized portions. Great spot for college students to take to go or sit upstairs. 

Oshii was one of the first restaurants I ate at in Pittsburgh, and it has always been one of my go to spots. It's consistent - everytime you go you know what to expect and the food delivers everytime. Not to mention, I am satisfied with all the prices there, as well as the portions (especially on the katsu don). What also stands out is that it fills you up but tastes clean - doesn't feel heavy and make you feel gross after. 

Typically I order katsu don which has pork, egg, and onion over rice which gives good variety compared to other things like the bulgogi bowl that is mainly just meat over rice. Sometimes I order the kalbi bento, (around $13) which is pricier but very tender and juicy. Bi Bim bap is another great dish for variety, gives you a decent amount of veggies to go with everything. 

You can also order online before hand so you save time."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I've been eating in many Korean and Japanese restaurants, but they still have a long way to masters their skills."}
{"text":"I originally tried this place because of the great prices, but kept going back because it was so good. I've tried about 5 of the sushi rolls and enjoyed them all. I also tried a teriyaki bowl which was very good. I really like the service and how the sushi bar is up front so you can see them preparing the rolls. This will be one of my most missed restaurants from my time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Oishii bento is situated in the Asian food megapolis of Pittsburgh...that is...Oakland.

So anyway, the place is a little shop along a street of other small Asian foods, and it really fits well in the scene. I usually like to stop by oishii and pair it with some other places around.

In terms of the food, I like it! It's very simple, cheap, and definitely fills you up. I would say the service can be a little slow at peak hour, so it's a good idea to order boba or run around for other food while you're waiting, but other than that, it's a well-run shop that is super consistent. The food gives a hint of homestyle Asian food, which is really nice if you're just looking for food that's comfortable and reliable."}
{"text":"Update: No change in quality of food but the last two times I have dined there, I have had to wait for the food downstairs.  They don't bring the food upstairs anymore..."}
{"text":"After watching a documentary on sushi I had a huge craving for it and consulted yelp for the best sushi restaurant. We didn't want to spend 20 dollars for 6 rolls so we chose Oishii. 

I thought that oishii was going to be another get your food and get out sort of place but no, we sat upstairs and dined.  There was a really efficient number system to their food and while the food didn't come on ceramic plates, the food itself was so good I forgot about it. 

We got the salmon roll, california roll, and a bulgogi bento box.  Everything was perfect. The food was equivalent to food that you'd get at any other classy upscale asian restaurant.  The amount of food that you get for the price is something you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"I may have ranked this place down for price before, but it has proven me wrong. This place is a fantastic place to find Korean and Japanese food of good quality. The beef (bulgogi) bibimbap I'm currently munching on is delicious and diverse in its offerings-bean sprouts, cucumbers, carrot, seaweed salad, beef and a fried egg over easy on rice. Delicious, but not overly heavy on spices. But there comes a little container of spicy hotness if you'd like to add it. Recently I tried the chicken katsu Udon, which was delicious! Lots of great entrees here, make sure to stop by at least once every couple weeks!"}
{"text":"Anyone will tell you that this place makes no sense.  Its got a japanese name and serves alot of korean food, but if you order the spicy pork, you'll understand why it doesn't matter (yes yes, I know the serve some japanese food, but mainly its just sushi).  Its not amazing, but its really good and its fast and cheap.  If you are walking around oakland and want something tasty, this place is second to none!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a couple of times and found the food to be excellent, and Korean food is hard to find here in Pittsburgh.  I've had the bi bim bap, the beef bul go gi and one of their sushi rolls and everything was prepared well and reasonably priced.  There isn't much seating so people generally take order to go but the orders are prepared pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was DELICIOUS!! Coming from the bay area I am super picky about my sushi, and this place was wonderful! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food that fits into my slim college budget without a doubt. Any meal I get is always under $10 and I'm stuffed by the end of it. Traditional, Japanese/Korean fusion done right!"}
{"text":"Slight hesitations if I made the right choice for sushi over Mt Everest and Fuku across the st. Got the ocean breeze, which typically is tuna and salmon together in one roll; they offered eel which I thought was interesting so that was why I went.  My mistake! It's actually just a single order of salmon and single order of eel.  I should have realized it when it noted 12 pieces but I just thought maybe they were small.

Anyways, the guy got my order wrong and looked annoyed when I told him I didn't order tuna but salmon.  Luckily they provided some
Barley tea on the side while you wait so I sipped myself to distraction while he remade my order. 

So, not what I expected but it was good! Large pieces and the fish is good for the price. I think its slightly cheaper than Mt Everest but simpler rolls.  I think if I had to choose I would go back to Everest for sushi but potentially come here for their donburis, I hear their spicy pork is pretty good."}
{"text":"Good bang for the buck, freshly made to order so be prepared to wait 10 minutes during a busy lunch line to be served. 

Had the spicy pork bento for lunch today. Good sized portions with your choice of miso soup, salad, or kimchi on the side.

I might quibble with the amount of onions in the pork mix, but it was till very tasty."}
{"text":"This will probably always be busy and filled with college students, but they have solid sushi and are a great place to get side orders of things when getting delicious, delicious chicken wings at Chick'n Bubbly next door.

If you get a lunch bowl to go, or eat upstairs in that dining room. Space is very limited and it's basically a take out place, but it is very worth it. Wanna grab a quick lunch to carry back to the office? This is definitely a great place to go for quick sushi in Oakland. 

Oh, and you should get a green or barley hot tea with your order. It's so calming and warm to enjoy on a stressful chilly day (as Pittsburgh days often are - chilly that is)."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine in Oakland. Great sushi and seaweed salad! There are a variety of other choices as well but I usually go here for the sushi. If you work or go to school in Oakland, it's a nice little place to grab lunch. But there is one caveat - if you arrive during the lunch rush, you may have trouble finding a seat and the wait may be a bit long. This can be problematic if you need to get back to work in a timely fashion. Otherwise this place is a favorite of mine. Ah, my eel roll has just arrived and my spicy roll is on the way. Time to enjoy! I encourage you to do the same."}
{"text":"I love Asian flavors.  This spot has Korean and Japanese fare and the menu was full of mouth-watering options by the look of it.  I could've chosen among sushi, udon, bento, or bowls for my meal.  I decided upon the Bulgogi bowl with the help of my dining companion for my lunch.  It was a huge bowl of rice and thinly sliced beef, mushrooms, onions, and scallions.  It was very delicious and more than enough.  I ended up taking 1/2 of it home for dinner.  

It's a small venue.  At first I thought it only consisted of the downstairs which only held room for a few at a small window counter.  I was glad when my friend escorted me upstairs to a bigger dining area.  Good thing we got there at 11:30; it soon filled up with the lunch crowd.

My happy dining experience cost under $7.00, well worth it."}
{"text":"man....what the hell?  the lack of good Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh is depressing.  I need a go-to-Korean BBQ place with the actual grills on the table.  I need a go-to Soon Doo Boo place. Still haven't found one in Pittsburgh.  Oishii bento is the best so far. The name of the restaurant implies it's Japanese.  I guess it sort of is, maybe?  This place is one of those places that likes to sprinkle sushi into their menu.    I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll accept rounding up.  It's not quite a 3 star place for me.  Oh well, at least it's better than what I had in Shreveport, LA, where I suffered for four years by the lack of culture and the battles through medical school.

Food (7.759/10) = the spicy pork bowl and bibimbap aren't bad at all.  Certainly not the best, but close enough.  The price is very reasonable for $7 a bowl.  Actually,..I can't remember the last time I saw a Korean restaurant serving spicy pork bulgogi or bibimbap for less than $10.  They throw in a quarter cup of kimchi for you too.  I haven't tried the sushi.  I haven't tried the Japanese dishes like udon or katsu-don.

Ambiance (7.5/10) = chill AZN joint.  Order your food downstairs, and go upstairs to chow down.  

Service (7.5/10) = standard.  Order your food downstairs, pick it up.  AZN fast food.

Overall Opinion = Oishii bento, you will have to do for now until I find a more suitable place for Korean food."}
{"text":"Though this was only my second attempt at Korean food, my visit to oishii didn't disappoint. After supposedly having the best Korean buffalo had to offer, i was curious to see how restaurants in Oakland measured up.
After reading reviews on yelp, i decided to give oishii a try.  The galbi was awesome- juicy, fatty, and tender. Based on limited experience, the kimchi was also really good. Not to hot but not bland either.
Maybe pricey by some college students standards, but you get your moneys worth. I recommend! I cant wait to come back and try what else oishii has to offer!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  Anything I order here is delicious !  I work in the area and if I'm ever ordering out for lunch you'll most likely find me here getting a tonkatsu bowl with a side of seaweed salad.  This is a breaded and crispy pork dish with a sweet plum sauce.  The serving sizes are always more than I can handle, which makes leftovers something I look forward to ;).  I can't express how much I LOVE this place.  I've been going here for years and I've never been disappointed! 

As for their menu they serve Korean and Japanese cuisine.  They have fresh sushi and I am not positive on this but I think they also own the store next door called chicken n bubbly that serves double fried chicken wings.  The receipt that comes from Oishi can usually give you a discount on the boba next door.  A couple of other dishes I've tried (but not pictured) include: bulgogi, bibimbap, teriyaki, udon noodles, and just about almost all the sushi options.  They also have interesting specials!  This is a great spot for students and professionals in the area.  I'm a big big fan"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Yelp does not have half star ratings, but I would award Oshii Bento a solid three and a half out of five stars. The greater portion of the menu consists of Bulgogi and Teryiaki based Bentos and Bowls as well as Sushi. I opted for a Bulgogi bowl which consisted of Korean style beef with rice, mushrooms, onions, scallions, and sesame seeds. It was  satisfying and filling (in fact, I was unable to finish the entire bowl). I would have preferred for the dish to be served with peppers and more scallions, but I will have to wait until next time to make that request.

I haven't had Korean food elsewhere in Pittsburgh, but the restaurant takes a fast approach to a typically slow, tapas-like cuisine. The adaptation certainly accommodates the restaurant's clientele (college students) and allows it to compete with the neighboring restaurants.

Lastly, I recommend ordering ahead. The wait for my food was only 15 minutes, but most of the customers who walked in ordered ahead and were immediately on their way."}
{"text":"I used to think that after I graduated and moved out, I'd never come back to Oakland. If Chick'n'Bubbly wasn't enough to keep me in the area, there's no better old friend than Oishii Bento.

I either get the Chicken Katsu bowl (over rice), or a bento box with either beef or chicken. I hear the sushi isn't bad, but I can't come here and not get a bento box--pickled vegetable, fried dumpling, rice, meat, and your choice of soup, salad, or kimchi. The world would be better with more bento boxes."}
{"text":"The Oishii Roll on its own gets this place four stars. The avocado roll and salad I got along with it were fine, but the special roll was one of the better tasting rolls I've ever had. Quality and taste shine here, so don't expect any frills!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the sides that come with the bentos here, especially the glass noodles.  A little bit of pickled yellow radish, and bit of salad hits the spot.

I don't, however, recommend the teriyaki bentos here.  I had the tofu teriyaki bento, and there was just too much sauce.  And big pieces of cooked onion.  Unfortunately the two vegetarian friendly bentos here are teriyaki dishes (tofu and vegetable teriyakis), so maybe I'm just outta luck.  The vegetarian sushi rolls are pretty limited to just cucumber, avocado and carrot, but they're decent.  

The upstairs seating area is brightly colored and pleasant for an Oakland eatery.  I'll come back to try the vegetable bibimbab.

*Edit: Another Yelper pointed out that teriyaki sauce can have meat/meat-based ingredients in it.  I didn't think of asking the folks at this place about that.  Double check before ordering if this is an issue for you, too.   You're not missing much if the teriyaki dishes aren't vegetarian-friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Veggie Bimbimbap! The kimchi and pickled vegetables were very flavorful, and the hot sauce came on the side so you can choose how much you want to order. 

The actual restaurant itself is very small, and the upstairs conditions aren't that great; all the chopsticks had splinters and were pretty old. This wasn't the best that I had, but it definitely wasn't the worst either."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Offers a wide variety of Korean and Japanese food, and is reasonably priced to boot.  The ton-katsu is particularly good, as is the galbi.  Perfect place for when you need lunch on the go, and offers take-out in a japanese style bento lunchbox with a wide variety of sides, including kimchi/salad, gyoza dumplings, mungbean noodles, and pickled radishes."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, and a sampler of food with the bento box. I recommend the bulgogi box, along with several of the other reviewers."}
{"text":"I stop by this store around 8PM.
Parking was really hard to find, but luckily I found one after search around about 10 min.
This was 2 storage building which they have a seat at second floor also.
I search the menu and this place more close to Korean food then Japanese.
Price was very reasonable.
I ordered Spicy Pork bulgogi bento and Miso soup, and it cost me not over 8 bucks.
I been lived Los Angles for 17 years, so my taste for Korean food is very spoiled.
When I tried to taste my food...well it was not great, but it was okay taste to me if you think about the price.
Miso soup was not that great, and spicy pork was little too much sauce on it. But for the overall taste when I consider here is Pittsburgh it was pretty okay to me.
I watched around what kind of the other people order here, and most of people was eating bulgogi ( Korean style rib eye) or garbi (Korean style BBQ short rib).
I re command you try bulgogi bento or Gari Bento."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to when I'm in Oakland for school/work. I'm a pescatarian, so I haven't tried any of the red meat or poultry dishes, but the salmon bento and rainbow roll are great. The miso soup is perfect for a cold winter day. However, I wish the sushi rolls had larger slices of fish, and I wasn't a big fan of the veggie bibimbap. Still, delicious and fresh food that is great for when you want something fast and healthy."}
{"text":"The bento boxes are excellent.  I've had the galbi, oishii, chicken katsu, and bulgogi.  They have all been good so far."}
{"text":"Decent value for the money, and I've been content with the things I've tried here. Being a grad student, I only allow myself a limited budget ($100) each month to eat out for lunch, and from that perspective, I consider this to be a \"mid-tier\" place- I can count on being happy with what I order, unlike some of the truly cheap places around; and although it's too expensive for daily trips, it's cheap enough that I'm a semi-regular customer. A solid choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my beef bulgogi bento box for lunch today.  The spicy tuna rolls were nomful as well.  and the price certainly kicked ass."}
{"text":"After being in Pittsburgh for the past few years, Oishii has become a comfort food haven for me. It's a small little restaurant in Oakland that nearly always has a huge crowd that's flowing out the front door. 
From Kalbi to Chicken Katsu bentos, I can't really complain. The selection here is centered around Japanese/Korean cuisine and includes sushi, bentos, noodles, and more. I haven't found anything I don't like on the menu, especially because I can easily try something new every time.
The service here is always efficient and kind. Recently, I phoned in a take-out order that wasn't written down and sent to the kitchen. However, the cashier quickly made sure that my order was prioritized and that I'd get my food ASAP. I really appreciated her attentiveness to my issue and her effort to fulfill my order.
The parking situation near here is pretty difficult, but there is a parking lot you can enter on South Bouquet St. that takes quarters!
Overall, I'd highly recommend Oishii to anyone. If you want honest comfort food, this place will not let you down."}
{"text":"This place has good rating for a reason. Decided to pick up food before I headed back home. I ordered a bibimbap bowl and one katsu chicken bento box. The bibimbap was fresh, and I was honestly quite surprised. Th bento box is great for heavy eaters. You get a LOT of food! I honestly couldn't finish it one go. It's very reasonably priced and everything I ordered was delicious.

There's seating upstairs, parking would however not be easy considering it's in central Oakland. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and I would recommend calling in advance if you plan on take out. They take forever to make the food if you order it at the counter.

Their food is super yummy and they have a bunch of different options. I usually order the chicken katsu bento, I can't help myself every time I come here. I like that they have a variety so I am sure anyone can find something that they would like there! 

There is upstairs seating as well as some counter space downstairs. It is a nice change of pace from the other food in Oakland."}
{"text":"First time, had the bulgogi bowl and oishii roll here. Having traveled all over the world and eating amazing Korean and Japanese food, this place is good and quite fair. Not great, but for the value I'll come back and try some other dishes. 

You order your food downstairs, service is good, menu is not too big and perfect I think. You can take-out or go up stairs to eat in. It can be quite busy due to the college scene. There are two other sushi restaurants right across from them too and this seemed to be the popular one."}
{"text":"Sushi was good , had a tuna roll , nothing special but was fresh and it was made while you wait .. Also ordered a bulgogi bowl and a chicken bowl for the kids.. The chicken bowl was ok, it was tender but I found myself wishing there was more sauce or different veggies in it . Overall, I would go back for sushi."}
{"text":"It's my favorite Korean joint in Pittsburgh. Good portion with reasonable price, and good quality too. I really like their galbi bento and spicy pork bento, but even there japanese dishes are really good too like donburi or udon."}
{"text":"The bento (not the bowl) is the best stuff I can get around this area to feed myself."}
{"text":"I am here nearly every other week! the food here is prepared efficiently and with fresh ingredients. I also love how well they pull off fast-casual sushi, bento boxes, and even galbi. I think the prices here are extremely reasonable considering the quality and volume of the food they serve. 

I also catered from Oishii and received excellent and responsive service. 

For the convenience, great service, and high quality food, I highly recommend Oishii Bento. Sometimes, however, I wish they were open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Aside from the moderately long wait for food, this place is great. Just plan ahead, time wise. The prices are very fair. Americans,I recommend for you to step outside of your comfort zone and order something aside from the teriyaki chicken or something along those lines. The spicy pork bowl is very good, if you like a little heat. The bentos are always great because you get a little bit of a few things. 

The upstairs dining room is always filled with Asians, which is a dead giveaway that the food is good. While eating today, I heard Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Korean all being spoken. That shows the diversity of the menu and that truly, anyone can find something here. 

4 stars."}
{"text":"This place has the best bulgogi in Pittsburgh. I ate tons of bulgogi growing up but every time I would order it in Pittsburgh I would be disappointed. Oishii Bento changed that for me. The place was packed and I was the only non-Asian in the place. We ordered the bulgogi bento, soft crab roll, miso soup and shrimp dumplings. Based on the prices, I figured the portion size wouldn't be that big. I was wrong. The portions are big and we couldn't finish everything. I have been walking past this place for the last couple of years and now regret not trying it sooner. I will surely be back to this place soon."}
{"text":"We like the place. It is very inexpensive. It's a better deal to get a bulgogi box than a bowl even it's $1.5 more."}
{"text":"Good on my wallet, cheap, and their bento boxes ain't half-bad."}
{"text":"The price is really good and is very popular among college student like myself. I usually get the bulgogi bento. One thing about the beef is that it's too salty to my non-Korean palate. Make sure to come here at non hour or you may end up waiting 40 minutes for food."}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time when I went to Pitt when I wanted some affordable korean food (the other korean restaurants in Pittsburgh are pretty pricey) i don't know why they say they're a \"Japanese\" and Korean restaurant because it just seems like a Korean restaurant. It's decent, there's definitely better but I've had worse too."}
{"text":"Got a bulgogi bento! This place is really busy around noontime, so it might be a wait. Thankfully theres plenty of seating upstairs. Needless to say, food here is pretty good. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my bf for lunch for some quick yummy food before heading to Phipps Conservatory. We got the bulgogi bento and chicken-katsu bento. It was nice being able to sit on the second story and people watch. The food came out really fast and for $8, you get a good amount of food. The bulgogi was flavorful and the katsu was cut into small sized strips. I think it was a good fusion between japanese presentation and korean food. There's a lot of things I wanted to try on the menu, so when I come back, I definitely would like to try the bulgogi bibimbab!"}
{"text":"Oishii is a hidden gem in my book! It is hidden off of Forbes on Oakland but I even almost drove past the place as was distracted by the other lit restaurants. Super clean and vertically compact inside. Order on the first floor and can eat on the second. Oishii to me is all about business. 

I came in looking for an array of udon dishes but instead found a focus on bento, sushi and bowls. I settled on the bulgogi bento with an app of tempura. Tempura was crispy and not greasy accompanied by a light sauce. Bulgogi bento came with cold noodles, rice, bulgogi beef and mushroom and onion combo, something yellow and then dumplings. Also with some miso soup. I enjoyed the cold noodles and dumplings. Bulgogi was ok though I think I will come back for the spicy pork. What I like about Oishii is the price for all of this food - $7.50 for the bento and $7 for the tempura. Can't be beat for dinner. I'll be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, and generous portions! This place is perfect for the college student. 

I usually get the bulgogi bowl, tonkatsu bowl, or spicy pork bowl and they're all very good. Always flavorful, and I can usually save half of it for a second meal (small asian girl). I've also had the bentos once, and while I really enjoyed it, I usually just opt for the bowls because they're cheaper and give you more food. 

The seating area is rather small though and it's upstairs. If you buy food here, you can show the receipt next door to Chick N Bubbly and they'll give you 50 cents off of bubble tea! Sometimes I'll just bring my food over the Chick N Bubbly and eat there after getting bubble tea, which can solve the seating problem."}
{"text":"Oishii has been a lunch time school treat for me throughout my years here in Pittsburgh- unfortunately I'm not the only one who loves it. The astronomical wait times to get your order make this the type of place to go if and only if you call in advance for take out or have 1.5hrs for lunch. 
Their spider rolls are fantabulous."}
{"text":"This place is popular with Asian Americans and students- not surprising with its huge tasty inexpensive Korean/Japanese takeout/fastfood style menu. I tried the tofu bibimbap bowl, and the pork Katsu Bento (at another visit).  The bento comes with an almost too hefty portion of rice-- perfect for hungry college students. It's pretty basic, filling food and for the price it's decent."}
{"text":"Oishii is always a great place to stop for a quick lunch or dinner on campus. It's a great value for how much food you get, whether you get a bowl or bento. My go-to is always the pork katsu teriyaki bowl, and it's always enough to last me a few meals. I haven't tried their sushi yet, but it looks pretty good and is reasonably priced as well. They can get quite busy at times (it's one of the more popular Asian restaurants in Oakland), so call in your order ahead of time if you can!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! I love that it's close to my work, I come here when I crave for any Asian food. From Korean to Japanese. It's like an authentic Asian food express. The price is very reasonable, and the service is always so efficient. I love their ton katsu, spicy pork, and bulgogi. I don't think I've had any food here that's not above average. Good job oishi! They also own the chick n bubbly place next door, if you get food from oishi they often give you a small discount on a recipe for bubble tea next door. 
Sometimes the wait doesn't get long during lunch and dinner time, so I would call and place an order in advance, just to save some time :p! Give this place a try if you haven't :)"}
{"text":"Galbi is good. Wait for 10 min and no place to sit. If you want to sit and eat, please think again"}
{"text":"Oishii bento is a low key place to order lunch and take it upstairs to eat. Upstairs, there is self serve water and a display to let you know when your order number is called. 

Most of the Oishii bento boxes come with a huge portion of rice, two deep fried gyoza, 2 picked radish, a little bit of glass noodles along with your main dish. I got the pork katsu, which arrived in a generous amount. However, the pork was too dry and the sauce too sour. 

The vegetable tempura was fried well and crispy but the vegetable slices were not cut well (the pieces were too big) -- the zucchini was cut at a diagonal because the slice was almost as long as the chopstick itself. 

The Oishii bento was also a disappointment. The tempura here was soggy and the button mushrooms were too sweet. 

If I were to come back again, I would try the galbi bento again. It used to be my favorite bento but the price has gone up and I thought I'd try something else."}
{"text":"This place serves a great bento! I went to grab beef teriyaki bento with miso soup. The teriyaki is delicious with huge umami punch to it. It also comes with fried gyoza and some sort of clear noodle salad, and both are great. The miso soup actually tasted good too and not like many soup that felt like watered down miso."}
{"text":"I ordered the bulgogi bowl. As someone hailing from Bay Area, California, which has a large Asian food scene, I was highly disappointed by the beef. The meat was poorly marinated and seasoned, and as a result, was dry and flavorless. Furthermore, the bowl was largely rice. Only plus side was that it was fair-priced for the amount of food you receive.

Perhaps I went at a bad time, as it was early in the afternoon. The credit card machine had poor reception, which required me to pay in cash. Not the best experience, but will likely come again to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Bruh!  

I can see how people around the school could like it here. The prices are decent and it's a nice place to sit and look out into the street, but come on ya'll...really? The miso soup was blah, the soda was flat, the beef teriyaki was chewy and the California roll was pitiful."}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up, my entire quality of life skyrocketed. I am originally from the Bay Area and am used to a large quantity of high quality Japanese food, not to mention my favorite Korean food ever (and I used to live in Hawai'i too). Since I moved here, I've tried udon in about 4 different \"Japanese\" restaurants. (I put that in quotes as the majority of them are run by non-Japanese who are clearly using a free hand to interpret the Japanese food.) This is the only place I got it more than once. In fact every month since they opened. And the Kal Bi, zomg, it is so good. Although after a year or so they sweetened the marinade. It's not as good, in my opinion, but totally worth ordering.

They have the tagline \"yummy lunchbox\" which is a literal translation of oishii bento. And let me tell you, it is seriously yummy. They are generously sized portions - the lunchbox will have rice, noodles, kimchi or salad, and a couple slices of picked daikon, and 2 gyoza as well as the main dish - and prices almost reasonable. I mean it's about Oakland prices when you compare to like, say, Qdoba, Panera, Red Oak Cafe, etc. I have also enjoyed the shrimp tempura appetizer and the beef bulgogi. The gyoza on the other hand is deep fried more in the Korean style, so that I don't love. Also the chicken teriyaki, while beloved of my co-workers, I found a little tough. Plus made with white meat, boooo. Oh, and they have sushi, but I am not a sushi eater, so don't ask me. Also, upstairs seating means it may be possible to eat in.

Frankly, Oishii is like one of my fave 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Oishii Bento, daisuke."}
{"text":"I don't come here very often, but I'm happy with the food every single time. They don't have a huuuge selection of Korean food but honestly I think it's not bad considering that there are other Korean restaurants in the area that want $20 for a bowl of kimchi stew (which is freaking ridiculous - I'll just wait until I go home, are you insane).

I've gotten various different things on the menu but I think my favorites are anything with bulgogi or their tonkatsu. Big portions and very flavorful food. I enjoy everything that I get here. I always call ahead since they can get pretty busy, so I'm usually in and out pretty quickly. Prices aren't bad. Workers are usually pretty nice and welcoming, indifferent at worst. I usually try to avoid eating at Korean restaurants because I'm biased towards my to Mom's cooking; but whenever I'm craving some basic Korean food, like bulgogi, I come here."}
{"text":"Great quality with awesome prices. So far I have ordered an ocean roll, seafood bowl, and miso soup. All are delicious and your receipt doubles as a coupon for the bubble tea place next door."}
{"text":"Oishii Bento offers Korean and Japanese offerings, I have only sampled the Korean dishes.

Cheap, delicious, and fast.  There is nothing else one can really ask for.  I've sampled their Spicy Pork Bulgogi Bento/Bowl and their Galbi Bento, and both are delicious.  All the meat options are made to order.  Bowls come with the dish on top of rice while Bentos also include pickled yellow radish, kyoza's (Korean fried dumplings), japchae, and the choice of a basic salad (iceberg) with peanut sauce or kimchi.  An entire meal runs for around $10 tops, and the average wait is definitely less than 10 minutes.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us.  The sushi and the hot food we ordered were good.  But this place is a take out, not a full service restaurant.  There are tables and chairs on the second floor but space is limited.

I may return to eat there but only it's because the location is close to Pitt"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend that you go here for dinner or if you want a nice sit-in meal, but it's really great for take out. The food comes out quickly and there are generous portion, and it's pretty decent Asian food. 

The sushi is pretty bad but the bibimbap and bento box is good. They give you a massive portion of rice so if you're into that, it's the place to go."}
{"text":"Lovely owner, and lovely sushi.  This was one of my go to spots when I went to Pitt.  The sushi is priced just right for students, and is always fresh and fast.  If you want to eat good sushi but not spend a lot of money this is the place!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews of this spot, and I was really excited to have Bento again. It's the kind of place where you place your order and then wait. 

The people behind the counter were not nice. The food took an eternity - like 25 minutes - to come, and I was super hungry. The price was expensive. 

The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"While trying out a bunch of the food places around the area, I came across Oishii Bento. The reviews were pretty good so I gave it a try. 

I came in during the lunch rush so there were a ton of people there. I got takeout so I waited downstairs but the waiting area was small so I winded up standing most of the time. The wait was quite long but so was the line, especially for a tiny place. I waited probably a good 10 to 15 minutes for my food and it was just uncomfortable for the first 5 minutes, since you had 20 people cramped in a space the size of my college dorm room. 

The food was not as good as I expected. I got the ton-katsu bento and una-q roll. The ton-katsu bento had its good points and bad. Good point was that the ton-katsu itself was pretty good. Another good point was all of the side dishes and the miso soup that it came with. Bad point was that the sauce was on top of the ton-katsu unevenly so I got too much sauce with some bites and too little with other bites. It would have been better if the sauce came on the side for to go orders, which I assumed it would as it was my first visit. The sushi, on the other hand, was mostly bad points. I absolutely love sushi so I was super excited to try some but winded up pretty disappointed. It was the type of sushi that you could get at any American supermarket. It had a ton of rice and some avocado and cucumber, and a tiny dot of eel. Not impressed at all. 

One thing that I really liked was that they had free hot barley tea in the corner, which was amazing on a day with negative degrees. It was not noticeable but it was still pretty nice that they offered that in the waiting area for takeout orders. 

Service: 4 stars - nothing out of the ordinary but I loved the barley tea
Bento: 4 stars - pretty good
Sushi: 1 star - pretty disappointed
Overall: 3 stars - there were other foods I wanted to try but I may or may not go again. We'll see."}
{"text":"my all time favorite. Bulgogi! I've had sushi once. I always get bulgogi. Very good, and fair price for the portion."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Asian food. Cheap, delicious, and if you know when to go, the service is quick. I usually hit Chick'n Bubbly next door for a drink while I wait for my order, too. The bentos aren't as filling as I like, but they're definitely worth the price. I highly recommend the galbi and bulgogi bentos and bibimbap."}
{"text":"I like their bento and kimchi~ However you have to wait for a long time to get your dish especially at lunch time."}
{"text":"The prices are pretty reasonable and the food was pretty good. I wasn't IN LOVE with the spicy pork bowl, but I'm definitely going to go back to try more of the menu. The pork was a good amount of spicy, however some pieces were very hard (some because they had tendon, but I couldn't find the reason for some of the other pieces). The restaurant's ordering area can get very very crowded around prime meal times, so big groups of friends may have a hard time finding seats. 

**update** The teriyaki chicken bowl was so delicious!! It was a great portion for the price that it costs. I would definitely come back to order other items!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the huge Oishii Roll for $11... It is serilously enough for two! Fast, friendly lunch service.  Go next door to Chick'n Bubbly for awesome bubble tea and better seating!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this place for lunch with my colleagues.   My favorite is the chicken katsu bowl. They offer generous amount of chicken and rice. The katsu sauce is very delicious. Typically?, I have leftover for dinner unless if I skip my breakfast that day and had to substitute the bowl for both breakfast and lunch. 

There is usually a wait time during the lunch time. However, you can place your? order on phone and  that will save you lot of waiting time. Or you can sit and watch them preparing sushi. 

Looking for a hearty and homely meal on a tiring work day, maybe this is the place you might want to go to."}
