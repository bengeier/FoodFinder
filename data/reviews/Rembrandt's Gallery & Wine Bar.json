{"text":"For a Madison noob, I am so thankful that this place exists. It reminds me so much of my hometown. I love wine, art, and pizza, so this is one of my favorite places to frequent. Everything is delicious, the staff is so kind. Go here!"}

Madison I hit this place up. Go and give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm having a bottle of Eruption and a pineapple BBQ pizza recommended by Pagedra. (Pardon my spelling) This place is nice and relaxing. The menu has enough to offer anyone something to cleanse your palette while you jump from vineyard to vineyard in your pursuit for the perfect wine. The decor is funky in an old storefront with art and pottery adorning the walls, but it adds to the atmosphere . Be sure to look for the small sign or you'll pass it 3 times, like I did! Lol, but once you come in, you'll fall in love with it and the people who work here."}
{"text":"Rembrandts is a spectacular gem in Madison.  Great wine. artisan flatbreads.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  It's also a gallery for handmade wood items (quality).  We have been here with groups and as a couple.  Service is a bit slow but I'm not in any kinda rush when I'm having a glass of wine on a perfect fall evening."}
{"text":"Great pizza in a great building with lots of character.  Wine,  art and pizza.  One of a kind wood tables and chairs (Madison Table Works) the first business of the proprietor,  has created a business for sitting around his works of art by creating great pizza and flatbreads to consume while drinking wine.  Other artists have their pieces in the Gallery & Wine Bar for purchase and we had a very relaxing evening with good conversation,  drinking a glass of wine while our pizza was cooking in the wood fired oven.  Can't wait to get back here."}

{"text":"Lovely setting, good food, fair prices, great and friendly service.  Romantic if you are in that mood, or want to be!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to a nice little artisan gallery and table manufacturing business.  A beautiful setting in an old carriage manufacturing building.  Nicely outfitted and there is not a better, more relaxing place to be on a nice summer evening.  They have big floor to ceiling doors they can open to let the fresh air and sunshine flow in.  Great wine and wine tastings with guest presenters, wood fired pizzas are also a great addition.  Don't be in a hurry or you will get disappointed because the pizzas can take a while if several others are in front of you but they are great.  They recently started offering burgers and also hard cider.  This was a great addition as well and very nicely done.  Sit down and enjoy a nice evening with friends here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, extensive wine choices, and a tasty menu! The Spring salad has an interesting mix of ingredients- highly recommend, along with the wood fired pizzas...we usually go for the Rembrandt pizza. The fruit and cheese plate is perfect to nibble on over drinks. Bob has an eclectic assortment of art to gaze at and where else can you dine on the most beautiful hand crafted wood tables. They are works of art and are crafted on site and available to purchase! My only wish is that they were open more often."}
