{"text":"A great place to visit and see how the locals do it!   The food was awesome...true southern style!  Prepared directly in front of you while you wait. I was surprised to hear how long this place has been around, as I've lived in Charlotte nearly two years before finding out about it. I tell everyone I know about it, make sure to check this spot out...soon!"}
{"text":"Rudean's is located on the west side of Charlotte, very well known to the locals as Ms. Rudean once had a club in the area also.  For the longest time I thought the restaurant was a club(I think it still is on the weekend) and never knew they actually sold food until hearing WGIV broadcast live for breakfast.  I thought I would drop by to test the waters......if you will:-)  The baked chicken, mac n cheese and greens weren't the best nor the worst I've ever had, but nothing that will have me in a rush to return.  I did enjoy talking to the owner and the staff while I was there, they made me feel like I was back home.........an old school vibe to this place."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! First time here and I'm sad that I waited this long to go. I ordered to go food with some friends and ended up sitting at the counter and it was like we have a crowd of friends within 5 mins. The wings are off the chain!!!! And the sweet tea is AMAZING!!! Get here before they close this place for good."}
