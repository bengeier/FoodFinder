{"text":"I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place my first time visiting Montreal. Thoroughly charming (the abundance of hanging plants is quite a sight), with great service and very good coffee. Anyone who is dairy free--you will be very satisfied with their alternatives! Will miss Montreal and my morning almond milk cappuccino at Pigeon."}
{"text":"Super service and great cappuccino. The ginger molasses cookie was just right. Pretty tables and benches, ideal for a small coffee break post-lunch."}
{"text":"Very overpriced coffee because it's \"imported\". 
Rude staff and garbage ownership aka Johnathan"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best lattes I have had. Whoever served me and made it was just amazing: extremely friendly. 

I love the theme: pigeons on the Connect Four tokens at the long window table (love that there's Connect Four), lots of plants, pigeon drawings, quotes, and just an overall really warm and welcoming aesthetic and aura. The place is quite small with only a few stools to sit inside, and a few benches outdoors. There is free wifi!!"}
{"text":"This is 4th stop with barista passport! What a cute spot! I love the name of the place, Pigeon espresso bar; very unusual and unique. It is a super small place. 3 or 4 bar stools indoor and two tables plus two small benches outdoors. Our barista was very sweet, enthusiastic and charming. I loved her spirit. I enjoyed thoroughly the decor inside the coffeeshop. Perfect lighting with plants. It had the young and hipster vibe. I ordered my usual cappuccino and my little sister got a gingerbread cookie. Both were delicious. If you are in downtown, near Concordia University, pass by..."}
{"text":"Sign in the window says \"worlds worst coffee\"... sarcasm or false modesty?  'Coz my latte was pretty darn good.  Super cute little spot near Concordia metro.  Great coffee and friendly service.  It's tiny, with seating for about 5 people.  They also have tea and hot chocolate and a small selection of baked goods.  Definitely a step up from Starbucks or Second Cup, will be my new drop in spot for a caffeine fix when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Pigeon Espresso Bar is the newest addition to a small group of new businesses at the corner of Maisonneuve and Bishop - right next to the brand new Brit&Chips. It advertises itself as the \"World's Worst Coffee\", something that made people quite curious. Today, my friends and I set to verify that claim. Well, it's unsurprisingly untrue. 

The place is smaller than expected, and doesn't have any seats. The interior is simple and modern, with exposed brick walls and tons of beautiful greens dangling overhead. A large, shiny espresso machine seats in the middle of the counter, next to coffee grinders and a display of delicious-looking pastries. They carry their own beans, in addition to Brooklyn's Stumptown (a very nice brand). It's not cheap (2.50-5$). We ordered a latte, an americano and a cappuccino (Pigeon brand). Service was fast and professional. The coffee was overall good, but flavours were rather weak. 

Pigeon Espresso Bar is hands-down the most handsome coffee shop in the neighbourhood right now, but its coffee still has some tough competitors.

Note: Cutest logo ever."}
{"text":"The first thought I had when walking into this cafe was \"wow this place is as tiny as me\". Then I looked up and noticed all the plants and vines hanging down from the ceiling. It was a feast for the eyes. The cafe advertises \"the world's worst coffee\" but it was pretty darn good. While there isn't much space to sit inside, there are a few benches and tables outside to sit and enjoy your coffee with a book. The service was good and the barista was very friendly and helpful. Definitely a nice little spot."}
{"text":"Alors il faut reconnaître que le café est bon pas excessivement cher par rapport au Starbuck ou autres enseigne. Ça pourrait devenir mon rendez vous de tous les jours... mais si je met 3 étoiles c'est à cause du service peux être que la serveuse était levée du mauvais pied ce jours là mais dans le commerce il n'y a pas de jours sans ."}
{"text":"Small and cramped indoor space, but they have a patio to accommodate more. My boyfriend ordered an almond latte and really enjoyed it. I had tea and it wasn't anything special. The barista was very nice  and friendly. I like the atmosphere and decor, but it's like any other hipster coffee shop."}
{"text":"Spent a week in 'Golden Square Mile' and visited this gem everyday (sometimes twice a day) for coffee or kombucha. Both the espresso drinks and filter coffees are outstanding. Loved the branding, and the friendly baristas."}
{"text":"A very small but cute coffee shop close to Concordia university. Beautifully decided with the wittiest signs and so so many hanging plants! It was so nice to something natural in such a small cafe. They have many options with baked food options. I had the iced cappuccino which was good but I wouldn't say the best I've had. It was very warm and sunny day so we sat outside on the benches. There are a couple of tables and chairs and benches outside. Inside a few high stools. It's a perfect pick and go coffee shop. There was only one person behind the counter but service was quick."}
{"text":"Super cute renovations! It's in a convenient location, right beside (or possibly on) Concordia University. It's a place where you grab coffee and go. There's not much seating space. However, there are a few seats that face the window. My friend recommended this place to me. Unfortunately when I did get around coming to this place, the coffee tasted burnt. Given that, I would give the coffee shop another try before I go to other neighbourhood coffee shops."}
{"text":"Okay stop. Interesting little shop but the Americano I had was not very strong. It tasted rather insipid.  They were out of the premium blend so I settled. For the house brand. I was in the mood for a croissant in the morning but they don't seem to sell them."}
{"text":"Hands down best coffee in Montreal. Small and unassuming, right next to Concordia university. Beautiful plants and nice decor. Really lovely baristas. The coffee is always perfect, and make the best almond cortados I've ever had. The place is small but perfect for taking an espresso at the window bar. Prices are comparable with others in Montreal. After trying a lot of coffee places in Montreal, this will always be the number 1 for me. Baked goods including the raw bar are really good."}
{"text":"Best coffee place in Montreal.  Serves their won roast or Stumptown.  Vegan friendly.  Great assortment of condiments including agave.  Kombucha on tap."}
{"text":"This little café is very close to MB building of Concordia University, making it very popular for students. There are only four stools with a slim table, so there are very few places for people who want to stay there. I highly suggest that if you want a coffee, just do take-out, because the café is really tiny. I tried their latte and it was quite good. The decor of the café is also nice with all the green plants suspended from the ceiling. It's super cute!"}
{"text":"I was attracted by the small advertise signboard \"World's Worst Coffee\" when I walked on the street. I was being curious for a while that how worst this coffee would be. After walking by several times, I finally got a chance to go inside. It's small inside as people can see from the outside. But I like the simple and modern style interior. Also, it's very clean inside. There are only several chairs in front of a black bar counter against the floor-to-ceiling window.
I ordered a latte with bean of Pigeon brand. It tasted really good! It was also very nice to sit in front of the widow, holding a warm coffee, staring at the street and feeling the time passing by slowly.

In one word, it's a lovely store with tasty coffee. I'll go back again one day and I would like to taste its pastries for the next time"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best lattes I have had. Sarah was super sweet and friendly. 

Very nicely decorated with plants and has a really nice feel. Since The place is very small with a few stools to sit indoors and benches outdoor. So it is ideal for pick up in the winter. 

I am a huge latte lover, will definitely be back."}
