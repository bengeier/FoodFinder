{"text":"If you have a 2 for 1 coupon, this place cannot be beat.  You can get a coupon in just about any local news paper.  The soups are very good, sushi is pretty decent for all you can eat, but the best is the stir fry.  The stir fry is located in the back, pile you plate with fresh ingredients and they cook it up right in-front of you.  A must have.  If you are going to go, make sure you get the stir fry!"}
{"text":"i go here often. this is one of the largest of all chinese buffets as far as selection.  the prices are reasonable, on the cheaper end. i always have good food here. it's not a fancy place and some of the booths have tears. they do have a couple tvs so if you want to catch and news or a game you can watch it while eating. i think this is an A+ for large variety. the servers are always quick."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE! I use to rave about this place but after today I will NEVER eat here again! COCKROACHES!!! I couldn't believe my eyes, I walked up to get a plate of food and what did I see...Yes a cockroach on the food counter!!! I couldn't get out of there fast enough...Enough Said!"}
{"text":"Where do you go when you are extremely hungry, have a yen for asian food and only have $13 to spend?  As long as you don't mind the sparse and tacky feel of being in a place that looks like it used to be a dime store in it's prior life then The Great Wall could just be the place.  Hey, ambience costs more.  The buffet is $9.95; drinks (soda, milk, tea) is extra.  The waitresses are very attentive and refill drinks without being asked at no additional charge.  Come when they first open.  You may have to wait a few minutes for them to finish bringing out all the food but it's worth the wait.  At least you will have first pickings and it's all fresh.  Lots of dim sum in addition to what you expect to see at Panda.  They throw in a little Japanese tempura and a little Thai just for good measure.  All the dishes are marked clearly and indicate whether it's hot or spicy.  Personally, I am partial to the baby octopuss, crab puffs and baos.  For the kiddies there is some \"American\" fare like salad, jello and egads, chicken nuggets.  It's kinda funny really, but if you are not picky, what the heck.  This is not gourmet by any means, but they won't try to chase you out and they are kid friendly.  If buffet is not your \"thing\" they do have a regular menu, but why bother?"}
{"text":"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER! I GOT SHRIMP A LA PUBE HAIR. So I just left this roach motel and I am sick so I am letting people know. I went there because my co-worker heard it was ok. Unfortunately for me I paid before eating so the chairs all have holes in them and the place looks creepy and no one, and I do mean no one, speaks English, which would not have been a problem  had not pulled hair from my food! I had not eaten very much when I asked for the manager, who I now refer to as, \"Chow Mein\". She was the rudest monster I have ever seen, and I watch horror films. Chow Mein screamed at me in Chinese and refused to do anything. Unfortunately, since I had paid already ofcourse she would not give me back my money or do anything to make up for the fact that her hair was in my food. All she did was scream at me. The waitress even told her that I did not eat and was there to witness me pull the hair from my food and Chow Mein was mad at the waitress for admitting it was in my food. Needless to say I urge you to eat anywhere else but here! i am sick and I may leave work early because my stomach is so upset."}
{"text":"Cheap, nobody bugs you, its what you expect from an Asian buffet. Pretty simple layout. Not super clean. You'll probably be pooping later. And yes they have cool place mats that tell you what your personality is."}
{"text":"Helloooo!  Oct. 19, 2013  Great Wall Restaurant on 43rd ave PHX was just cited with 7 health code violations by Maricopa Coiunty Health. Just to let you know ..."}
{"text":"Constant dans la qualité et le service, ce restaurant style buffet chinois est assez populaire dans ce coin de l'Ontario. Ce ne sont pas des ingrédients de tout premier choix, mais le rapport qualité prix est assez bon et certains plats sont bien meilleurs que d'autres.   En prime, ce restaurant est tout près de l'autoroute 401 qui relie Toronto à Kingston ou Montréal."}
{"text":"yelp Google yahoo and all the social media are total BS  how can they have more stars than Chipotle ????? They also control how many stars you try to give. One star they post right away, 5 stars they need to review it LOL Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Surprise Surprise, the food quality at a Chinese buffet is less than stellar, I know, big shock.  We went here on a holiday so there was promise of crab legs and lobster in the buffet.  These things were in the buffet, but they were not good.  You can't expect seafood to be perfectly cooked if it sits in a steam tray for hours.  And the crab legs and lobster were not pre cracked, and they do not have the proper utensils for guests either.  All the flesh  was impossible to get to, and was shrunken and clung to the shell.  There was also no rhyme or reason to the placement of things in the buffet.  The chocolate pudding was found beside the potato salad.  The sweet and sour sauce was with the salad dressings that were beside the soup...  The only good things I had from the buffet were the won ton soup, and  the pork dumpling.  They do have a made to order stir-fry station that looked promising however I didn't get that far before I was full from over-fried, over cooked, over battered cheap food.  Only took 2 trips, as I avoided the section with french fries and onion rings.  Hardly worth the $54 for 2 people including soft drinks.  Make sure you have a coupon."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Asian buffet I've ever been to. You walk in and you can get a sense of the dinge. The table I was seated at had two ripped leather seats with foam spilling out. Sure, Asian buffets can be of questionable quality, but this took questionability (is that a word?) to new extremes.  The food? Let's just say oilier than Jermaine Jackson. The chicken and beef made my stomach spin into a giant vortex of bleh - you really got the sense that their shelf lives were long gone. I left half my plate there and walked out - no longer hungry even though I was starving when I walked in.  I'm not biased against Asian buffets. Just this one.  My poor stomach. All abused."}
{"text":"UGGGHH ~ DON'T do it!!! I really wanted 2 like this place but it's not a 'Gr8' anything except @ giving violent lengthy sessions praying 2 the porcelain gods as a result of giving them a try (a gamble I was pretty quickly sorry 4 having taken if it weren't 4 my lunch companion's insistence).     I wasn't expecting much & everything I tried seemed 2 b @ the right temp & most items ranged from decent-good tasting, but 15 min8es in I fell ill w/ severe pain & loud thunderous disapproval stemming from my extremely unhappy stomach. Not sure exactly what the culprit(s) were, but I noticed the lo mein noodles were far greasier than they looked present8ion~wise b4 being on my pl8. I also had some green beans & mixed veggie dishes in addition 2 some EFY, couple bites of an imit8ion crab looking casserole, & a couple Crab Puffs w/ the red sweet n sour sauce. Whatever disagreed w/ me certainly gave me a 'sour' stomach & such painful forceful heaving that I thought I'd literally c my guts coming up any moment as I felt pretty much turned inside~out.     I wasn't intending 2 visit their restrooms as I have a gr8 disdain 4 public 1s (which turned out 2 b a 'case~in~point' why) but it was either that, or lose it all @ the table. If u need 2 throw up, the condition of the bathrooms or even on ur way 2 them will easily push u over the edge (not that I needed it as I barely got there w/o cre8ing a spectacle as it was). Funky rancid stench & stepped on fortune cookies etc carelessly left in ur path on ur way there as u pass kitchen/janitorial workers who r 2 busy hanging around the soda fountain thinking it's a QT.    Do urself, ur body & health a favor of skipping this place. I've never been so sorry as I was yesterday 2 give the benefit of the doubt 2 an establishment  by unknowingly risking myself in the process. I guess it coulda been worse = by spending full amount instead of the discounted price (thx 2 a coupon) 2 get an instant case of food poisoning. I wouldn't wish this on any1 & this has got 2 b the most Excruci8ing bout I've ever encountered ~ & I've experienced a couple b4!! Service was ok, interior outd8ed & in desper8 need of an upgrade (esp the latrines which were equivalent 2 rest~stop bathrooms @ best)!!     Well, can't say I didn't give them a shot but take heed, ur better off not giving them the same chance I gave 2 prove I shoulda been more cautious about the neg8ives st8ed in previous reviews....... This is a case of shoulda stuck w/ my 'gut' so I could keep mine, instead of being talked in2 something against my better judgement..... ;-("}
{"text":"We noticed today that there were no customers so went and took a look.  There is an eviction notice on the door stating they were $135K in arrears on rent!  The date was August 14, 2013.  I would guess that means they are gone for good now.  I wonder who will go in there next?  Update on 2/24/14 - There is a sign out front saying it will be reopening soon as Yongs Super Buffet $9.99 for lunch and $15.99 for dinner.  I hope the new owners do a better job!"}
{"text":"This place Is not as a good as a lot of the the Chinese super buffets but  they had 90+ items and everything I ate was good. All the food was was at the right temp. and the service was fast and friendly. This place gets way to many bad reviews so I am giving them 4 stars instead of a high 3 just to help them out.This is a buffet I would return to. So yes I am a fan.(chinese donuts real good)."}
{"text":"Within an hour of being home after eating there, the three of us had food poisoning and got SO sick!  Never eat there!  Horrible!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was somewhat busy which is good to see.  What I did not like to see was hair in my food.  When I was trying to explain it to the employees there I got no where as they do not understand English very well.  I have not been back since then.  I advise anyone who chooses to patronize this establishment to look very carefully at the food you select."}
{"text":"Everyone give this place a bad review. I've been here 3 times and I'm never dissapointed. When going to a buffet it's all about the timing. If you go during slow hours of coarse it taste like shit. Why would they keep putting out food. I come during the lunch or dinner rush. I'm sitting here eating as I'm typing this review and there are a lot of people here. They have a good selection and its tasty! I only give it 4 stars because the iced tea tastes a little funky. I've never gotten sick from here. And if you don't want to come here fine, more food for my fat ass!"}
{"text":"Dang, I have to demote this to 2 and a half stars, rounded up to 3.  The food was a disappointment during a previous visit, but I thought it may have been just an off day for them. I went in today hoping to find the food as good as during my first visits, but unfortunately this meal was just as disappointing as the last one. There were still some good dishes - the clams in spicy broth, the shrimp dishes, the veggies, the baked yams. But the sushi - which I raved about in my previous review - was not quite fresh, the fish fillets had a batter that was still uncooked underneath the fried exterior, the fried chicken was a little tough and tasted like reheated leftovers. The rest of the  dishes remained pretty much the same as in previous visits: some good, some just OK. For now I have to take this off my list of preferred buffets."}
{"text":"Really bad.  Really.  Just don't.  I normally write longer reviews, much longer, but just don't.  It's really bad, not as a buffet, but as, anything.  Don't."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this buffet for a long time, since it's close to where I live and I pass by it all the time. Got my chance today, and was it worth the visit? Well, I did enjoy my meal but It wasn't something to write home about, either. I would say it's a moderately good Chinese buffet, not great. Some of  the dishes were just OK, some were good, a few were great. Recommended dishes: their fried chicken (just lightly flour-dredged, not thickly battered, and very tasty), the Singapore rice noodles, and the shrimp dishes. Other dishes, including dessert, were about typical for a  large Chinese buffet restaurant.  The restaurant is very spacious and the servers were very friendly. My meal here was not spectacular, but pleasant and satisfying enough."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst place I have ever eaten. I will be amazed if I do not get sick from this experience. The entire time I was there nothing was rotated. Everything was cold. No rating on the door. My first clue should have been the lack of people. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I don't know why i come back to this place. Its always a stomach ache away. It used to be cheap but they jacked their prices up and it doesn't make it attractive anymore. Restrooms are horribly dirty. The place is mediocre clean. The food is ok but way too greasy. I remember the first time i went it was good i love it but its gone downhill over they years. I don't think i will ever go back."}
{"text":"an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but the selection of food has dwindled.  However, the location is perfect and when you want to stuff your face this is the place for a great price."}
{"text":"OK... so not the best buffet I've ever been to, and certainly not the worst. Honestly, this place didn't really seem that big, but once you get inside there is a wide open space with lots of seating. You can tell this place has a lot of mileage - everything from the building to the decor and TVs are pretty old. But the people here are nice and they seem to have a steady crowd that come here often.  The couple times I've come here for lunch, the food was fresh and hot and the stations were clean - so no complaints there. For under $8, not that bad a place for a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what it is about this location but every chain that has tried to make a go of it here seems to fail miserably and I'm afraid that Great Wall Buffet will be the next in a long line of casualties.  Over the last several months I've seen this place deteriorate drastically to the point where, when I came here last night for dinner, I was hard-pressed to find something that was actually edible.  The quality and selection of their food has gone completely downhill and I no longer consider this restaurant to be worth the time or money... even with the 2 for 1 coupon.  I suspect their days are numbered."}
{"text":"I really love the food. My favorite is the clams, shrimp, crab puffs and crab. The people there are very nice. I haven't tried all the food but what I ate so for is delicious."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it two stars was because the food was edible. Wasn't tasty and it wasn't horrible. Good customer service but it does not make up for the food."}
{"text":"Not good anymore! Food quality is not the same as before. I think it was last my visit to this buffet. Was poisoned from the food. Prefer to spend just 5 or 10 dollars more and go to real  Chinese restaurant in Scarborough. Check Hi Shanghai restaurant, fair price and best Chinese food (dumplings and more)."}
{"text":"We arrived an hour before close and there was barely anything left. Everything else was Luke warm and just tasted old and gross.  Pretty much a waste of money."}
{"text":"EW, this place stinks! Literally I don't know what the funk that smell was but it gagged me at the door. I decided to check out the buffet. It looked a mess. Most dishes were overcooked. The Mongolian BBQ had raw beef, chicken, pork and fish sitting out in what I would call a salad bar. The meat looked old and the beef was starting to turn. It wasn't even covered yuck!   I decided I did not want to spend the night in the ER having my stomach pumped so I left. This is a scary place enter at you own risk.   My taste-buds were spared the torture, I went to Famous Sam's and had some wings!"}
{"text":"Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.    Located in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  Let's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.  Do not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.  The other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.  After eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try this place out again since it was pretty good the first time around.  This time I was pretty disappointing.  Last time I went it was after 12 noon.  This time I came in just after 11am.  What a difference an hour makes.  Almost all of the food wasn't hot at all.  Fries, wings and some of the other stuff was cold.  Some of the other was lukewarm.  I'm not an expert by any means but food has to stay at a certain temp to keep from making you sick.  I had my first plate and was very hesitant to go back for more.  I waited until the kitchen guys brought out the fresh hot food before trying anything else.  The place opens at 10am so there's plenty of time to get the warmers going.  If they don't fix it and continue to serve food that temp than someone will get sick."}
{"text":"I do admit this place could use some rehab and a little cleaning but my family and I have been coming for YEARS and we've gotten to know the owners and staff. They're awesome people. I have been to many, many, many, many, many Chinese buffets and this one along with Lims is at the top of best Chinese places. It's hard to find a place that puts up with all my family and many others (since each Sunday after church over half the Mexican population congregates here). The food isn't anything special but its at a fair price and its all you can eat. So live life a little dangerously and venture in here to experience an authentic buffet."}
{"text":"What makes this americhino boofay different from all the rest? Nothing.  It's just got decent quality consistency in the food.    Most of the service is also of a decent quality.    The variety is quite good for the price.  With mongollian grill included, your choices are just as much as at the super buffets, but a few bucks less out of pocket.    They've got a great coupon where weekday lunch between 2-3pm is only $3.99 drink included!"}
{"text":"I called the health dept on this disgusting place and a inspection will be happening soon. I also filed a complaint with the BBB. As for anyone thinking of eating here, I urge you not to if you have any shred of dignity."}
