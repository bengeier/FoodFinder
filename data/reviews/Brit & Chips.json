{"text":"Not a huge fish fan but this place was great.  The fish wasn't fried too much and the breading was really good.  The beer selection was pretty regular (at least for canada or montreal more specifically, if I was in NY I'd say it was sub-par).

Would def. come back and try the other varieties of fish they have, as well, which is nice since it's not just cod.  I had the cod but the lady friend I was with had the haddock.  Both were really good!  Next time I'm in town I will def. make it a point to stop by again."}
{"text":"If only they didn't over fry the chips this would be five stars. 

I grew up on Fish and Chips in the UK and this is by far the best fish and chips place I've found in 20 years living in North America and I've tried hundreds. Okay it helps that the owners came from England and being the best was their strategy but it's not often people actually achieve it. Brit and Chips has. 

Straight away you notice that it's set up like a proper f&c shop, long order counter, long bar table with stools and an area with grouped table and chairs. The restaurant is spotlessly clean; not even salt spills on the counters. That speaks volumes about their approach to business and food. 

There's a superb selection of fish, each served with a unique batter, designed to enhance the fishes own natural flavor but you can opt out of that if you're insistent. There's pies, pasties and some nice shrimp/scampi salads. 

The fish frying is done to perfection. No greasy, oily residue just piping hot fish and soft crispy batter. The two separate easily and the fish remains firm yet easily flakes - just as it should be. The chip frying is unfortunately more haphazard. Twice the potatoes were golden brown, third time dark brown and fourth so dark and blackened ends that we sent them back. Was really surprised but we were told that other customers had ordered them like that. Well not us!  

The menu also includes traditional chip shop items you just don't find in the USA - scotch eggs, pickled onions and mushy peas. All wonderful in their own strange way and a true taste of Blighty. 

Fish review:
Cod and burgundy batter. So good, so much like a taste of merry old England and a wonderful example to anyone of how fish can be prepared and fried. It had all the right notes to take me mentally back years and if you're trying fish and chips for the first time this is the one for you. 

Haddock with maple syrup batter. By far the stand out for me. I have an adventurous side and this speaks to that. A lot of English and a little of Montreal. If they did exports I'd buy the batter by the pint. It's subtle but beautiful. Adds a slight sweetness which enhances the truly fresh, firm fish. It's a combination that is just heavenly. Loved picking this up when it was so hot that it hurts your fingers but it feels so good in your mouth.

Hake and orange crush. An underrated fish in my opinion which is greatly enhanced by expert prep and a good batter. Brilliantly done, elevated this fish to a new level. 

If you're a fan of f&c or trying it as an alternative to the spring fast food you can't go wrong. My favorite fish and chip shop in North America by miles."}
{"text":"Assez rare de trouver un bon fish & chips par ici je trouve ! Le poisson est bon, bien frit, la carte assez complète (environ 6 poissons proposés). 
Je n'ai pas gouté la bière, mais parait-il qu'elle accompagne royalement le plat.

Petit bémol, les frites cuites je ne sais pas combien de fois dans l'huile, beaucoup trop grasses pour accompagner qql chose de déjà frit. Poisson sans frites pour ma part, a emporter avec des frites maison !"}
{"text":"There are some pretty interesting batters at Brit & Chips (eg. orange crush, maple syrup). It's your typical pub fare with a pretty extensive menu. 

The maple syrup battered haddock was pretty good, the maple wasn't too overpowering and the chips were GREAT. The service was also really good...the waiter kept making suggestions to make our bill total lower. I understand that Brit & Chips gets pretty busy and I imagine it would get really crowded as the tables are a bit close to one another. I was also surprised to see that they close at 10 or 11pm on weekends... I would've thought that a place like this would be a haven for those who need to...\"recuperate\" ;)

Definitely give Brit & Chips a try if you're jonesing for some legit English pub fare"}
{"text":"Excellent Fish&Ship ! Tout comme à Londres. Une panure du mois et les habituelles. À essayer, toujours un pur régal. Pour les petits appétits, partagez-vous une frite à deux, il y en a suffisamment. Autour de 12$/personne."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a fish n chips kinda girl, but I would definitely come back to this place. Try the haddock, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fish person but have been having a mad craving for fish and chips lately. I found Brit & Chips located in proximity to metro Square Victoria. My partner and I ordered each 2 different kinds of fish to share. We ordered the salmon battered with Guiness and we ordered a hake battered with Orange crush... They were both very good. For appetizer we had battered shrimps that were very yummy and the fact that I enjoyed them even shocks me because I normally don't like seafood. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that enjoys fish and Chips.... They have several interesting dishes and also a variety of imported sodas. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 10 (Sept 17,  2014). Too small inside so we ate outside. Lots of interesting fish options (maple syrup batter). Fast, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went to Brits & Chips with two English friends for dinner (after PyCon 2014- python conference) and all of us loved the food. I was surprised that both fish and fries (chips) here were not greasy in comparison to many of fried food I had in US (fries also had more potato content than many other empty just crispy fries). I had gluten-free hake with chips, and I enjoyed the whole experience. Though I don't have any basis for comparison, because this is my first official fish & chips (and definitely first gluten-free version). 

For me one of the most important thing about fried food is whether I feel well after because I have a pretty sensitive stomach. I feel pretty sick soon after having fried food at places that presumably use bad quality oil (or continuously re-use oil which is supposedly bad). I had no problem with food here. All the fried food was timely fried, just right between chewy and crispy outside, and rich with actual fish or potato inside, so I could actually appreciate simple taste of fish and potato as food, not just something overpowered by and oozing with grease (which unfortunately happens at many places). One of us got Haddock which was fried in Maple Syrup Batter which he said was amazing (and he's English and would know good taste of fish & chips way better than I do =)).

It's a small, quite interesting place; I've simply never been to a place like this in US or elsewhere. It's hard to describe but there are two super close narrow, long high tables facing opposite directions (you'll be super- and really mean this- close to person sitting on the other side) and several sit down tables at the back. 3 of us sat at normally 2 ppl table in the back, which was comfortable. (3 or less seems like the right group size for this place). Our server was friendly and helpful with our questions. I'm totally biased here, but  this was one of the most memorable and enjoyable food & experience I had in Montreal (perhaps one of my favorite comfort food ever, and one of my favorite fries. the way 'chips' are cut compared to fries, it is more potato-ey and just tastes better IMHO- found this way more tasty than poutine), something I'll truly miss when I return to SF."}
{"text":"Service was fast, waitress was super nice, food was alright: the fish was good (maple syrup batter!), chips undercooked inside but brown outside, side salad was limp. Not sure I would go back. Maybe it was just an off-day for the cook (considering the other positive reviews)."}
{"text":"Brit and Chips offers five types of fish, each (not including the fish of the month) with its own unique batter - not including the Veggie Haloumi \"fish\"; the fake, mock fish... the \"fockish\". I had the salmon in Guinness batter. Two generous hacked fillet of salmon, I had the \"with chips\" option on the menu; I mean what's fish and chips without the French fries, I mean chips? Then it would just be \"fish\" and that's not fun. Not that it goes without saying, but the chips were as honest as a 19th century British machine worker covered in soot - hard on the outside and pillowy inside; never call a factory worker \"soft\".

Salmon has a tendency to dry out and become dense when overcooked - the fish was perfectly cooked, tender and flakey while remaining a blushing pink in the middle. You can't really taste the actual Guinness in the shattering batter, however, the dark, murkier and earthy flavours that a stout has is definitely noticeable after a few bites as the flavours linger in your mouth."}
{"text":"Asked the concierge, Jean Francois, at the Embassy Suites for a great fish & chips place for locals.  BAM !!   Brit & Chips gets it done.  Old school fish & chips designed to clog your arteries in the best possible fashion.    Some things taste just too good to give up, and this qualifies.   About 6 to 8 types of fish available, each with its own distinctive batter.   I had the haddock with maple syrup.  Mon frere rolled with the sole.  Both great.   Scorching hot from the fryer, so you'll need to balance the scales with a ice cold beer.    Haven't had fish & chips this good since I hit it on the fishing docks on Victoria Island.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bon service rapide"}
{"text":"I like this place for when I am in the area and I want something fast to eat. The fish is always well cooked and the fries are also really good. Service is excellent and they serve the food pretty quick."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you feel like you're in a real fish and chip shop in England. The cod is fresh and the chips are real. They even give you a wooden fork to eat it. These are the best fish and chips in North America! They also have a 99 for dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm a brit living in the US visiting Montreal and \"Brit and Chips\" had to be tried. I have a constant struggle to find good fish and chips in North America and I wasn't holding out much hope for this place, how wrong I was. I had the Haddock in maple syrup batter and I have to say it might have been the best fish and chips I have ever had, in North America or in England. The batter sounded weird but complimented the haddock perfectly in a really weird way that led to a very slightly sweet fish that tasted like heaven. Coupled with good chips that looked double fried (like they should be) and a good beer and I was a very happy Englishman."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  It's a place for fish, which I don't eat.  So I had the popcorn shrimp with frites.  Yummy.  The batter delicious and the chips were perfect.  It's a place for locals, but everybody fits right in.  There was great, friendly service, and smiles and cheers all around."}
{"text":"I've been quite a few times and typically enjoyed the experience. It's heavy and greasy, but that's what you're there for. 

Today, I stopped in for lunch and it wasn't too busy. I ordered the chicken and leek pie with chips as I've done several times before. When I got back to my office, this is what I opened. It looks like half a pie (not at all like what they used to serve.) and a small amount of chips. Four bites of the pie and it was gone.

I've had this before and enjoyed it and have enjoyed their fish before too, but I wanted to send this shout out to the owners to say I wasn't impressed nor happy and it will be a while before I consider going back there for my fix."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 
Horrible horrible experience, owner named Jonathan refused to fix anything and acted as if he can do no wrong. 
What a joke."}
{"text":"I've had much worse fish n chips in England!  The batter has a really unique flavour, having pepper mixed in which makes it really interesting. Chips were ever so slightly overdone however but I like a lot of good malt vinegar on my chips which softens them up. 
They have proper English condiments as well, you can't beat real chip shop Sarson's vinegar from England. 
Overall a great meal, oh and you can get a 99 ice cream for desert! :)"}
{"text":"I was born and raised here in Montreal but I'm a huge Anglophile (no, not over the English language) and of course, I traveled to Britain. So when I discovered this place with a few friends of mine, I was thrilled to have a place to go to, as well as Burgundy Lion (which is owned by the same people) whenever I miss the UK. Which is pretty much all the time.

The atmosphere of the place feels authentically British down to the newsprint tissue paper that is served on your plate. \"How sweet\", an English dining companion of mine commented. 

When I traveled to Britain, I didn't sample the fish and chips because I was a vegetarian at the time so the only dishes I could compare them to were the ones in Boston (they were fabulous) and McKibbin's, Aqua Lunch and Kelseys. Aqua Lunch and Kelseys don't necessarily count but either way, McKibbin's wasn't all that impressive and was way too greasy for my tastes.

Enter Brit and Chips. Tried the usual batter, the Doritos one and the sour cream and onion one as well. I find myself craving them all the time. And the haloumi is another addictive item I find myself ordering every time I'm there. The batter is crispy and greasy but not greasy enough to the point where you feel as if you're drinking and tasting oil more than the fish (or the cheese) itself. 

So why the 3 star rating?

Because their staff is quite rude. Rude enough for me to wonder if this was part of their attempt at British authenticity. The service workers in the UK are usually not all that perky and smiley and I've witnessed some pretty blunt fights between service workers and customers that we would never get away with over here in North America. But I don't necessarily expect smiles or anything like that. Anyway, I have walked into Brit and Chips on more than one occasion feeling as if I just interrupted something. I walk in, nobody says hi, everybody just stares at you and it feels like high school all over again. Sometimes I am at the cash, waiting awkwardly for someone to notice and to take my order. What the? I have felt unwelcome on several occasions and that's not something a customer should feel especially if they're giving you business! I don't expect feigned joy at the sight of me but an instant hello, smile or not, does the trick.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when the cashier girl asked me--and I will quote her verbatim \"you didn't tip. Was that intentional?\" and then proceeded to screw up my order upon that discovery. I was pissed. That was the tackiest thing an employee from Brit and Chips has done. I have tipped other employees generously (the ones who have covered the basics like acknowledging me) but I am also a regular and this was takeout. Managers, you either need to hire new staff or train them to have courtesy towards your customers!"}
{"text":"My favorite fish and chips restaurant in Montreal. The price is cheap and the amount is big."}
{"text":"As promised, we returned yesterday and had the same fish and chips as last time. A little greasier this time but still very good. Still highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you feel like sticking it to the poster child of francophilia that is le Québec, come eat here! 

On a more serious note, though, this place is merely okay. You do have a fair selection of (what tastes like) fresh fish to choose from and the fries were prepared well, but it's nothing to write home about and it is slightly overpriced. 

Steer clear if a claustrophobe."}
{"text":"Totally authentic and absolutely delicious. And they had my favorite drink IRN-BRU. Loved it!"}
{"text":"After craving fish and chips for awhile and finally discovering that Montreal actually has a pretty decent fish and chips place, I decided to venture to Old Port. 

My partner and I went on the coldest day ever, it was windy, cold, snowing. And to top it of all we got lost on our way. Just as we were going to give up, we started to smell fried food. So we thought \"Well it should be a good sign yes?\" Turns out it was the 5 Guys smell. Hah! Little did we know that Brit & Chips was just across from them. So we finally got there and ordered their regular fish and chips plus tandoori/curry shrimp \"pop-corn,\" we cal them pop-corn 'cause they were tiny and delicious!

I have to say, though, it was kind of expensive for fish and chips. But splurging once in awhile is good, right?"}
{"text":"This place is just as advertised.  They serve delicious fried fish.  We tried the haddock, sole, and popcorn shrimp.  All were perfectly cooked and delicious.  The fries could have been a little crispier for my taste.  For dessert we had the \"Fried Whatever.\"  This was a fried candy bar.  We got one of each type available and they were all good, especially the Snickers bar.  The service was great and staff friendly.  The atmosphere is casual and the price inexpensive."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips in Montreal. The bater is light the fish is melt in your mouth good. The service is just the best and very fast. Worthe the detour."}
{"text":"The pasties are awesome, especially the steak and veg pastie. If you haven't tried this British specialty you don't know what you're missing. The fish is really good too-- we got the haddock, it was perfect. Good chips too. Friendly staff. After trying this place we had to go back for dinner the next night so my daughter could get her own pastie!"}
{"text":"I am a little confused/upset by all the positives reviews on this place... which was what lead me to eat there.

I am not British, so I am not here to comment on whether the food is authentic or as good as you may get it in the UK, because I do not know that.

What I know is that I have had good/decent Fish 'n Chips before, and it wasn't as drenched in frying oil as at Brit & Chips. It almost made me nauseous by the end of it, and don't get me wrong, I usually LOVE deep-fried anything.

The chips were also soaked in frying oil, which made them kind of unbearable and grossly soft. 

Not what I expected, and definitely not worth $12 per person. :/"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend who is originally from London.  I had recently just come back from a trip to London so I had fish n chips on my mind.  We came on a sunny warm afternoon in July and sat on the little outside tables set up on rue Mcgill.  

They have an ok selection of English ales.  Not too many choices, but a lot of items that you normally can't find in MTL (i.e. some sodas).  I ordered the cod and chips.  The fish comes in the burgundy lion batter.  I have to say that the batter didn't overtake the fish and the fish was still tender and juicy.  I actually thought that is was a little better than the one I had in London.  My friend also agreed that the fish and chips here are almost as good as the ones back home.

It was a good experience overall and need to come back when the weather warms up again."}
{"text":"Jam packed and you can see why. Vatious types of fish, each robed in its own special batter, can be ordered with or without chips. the classic cod is my favourite. and definitely order the chips. batter stood up excellently against a liberal sprinkling of malt vinegar. quite good scoth egg and sausage roll amongst the sides. and no joke, the mushy peas are great for just a buck! next time, I'm going to try the pies."}
{"text":"Wasn't really a fan of fish & chips after trying some not so good ones in London. But when we decided to try this place out. Let's just say we finished what we ordered. 

I ordered the haddock fish with maple syrup batter. Sweet & salty = perfect! The fish inside was cooked well and the batter outside was crispy. The chips were great too. Real sliced potatoes! Whilst, my mom got the sole fish with the sour cream & onion batter. 

I must say they did not disappoint. Wish we had this in New York City!"}
{"text":"Sorry for the short review, but i don't have a lot of spare time.
Had the aiglefin and saumon
Great tasting and thin batter.
The fish was simply melting in our mouth.
Best fish and chips I've ever tasted outside of Vancouver ;D"}
{"text":"I've tried most of the menu items. I think the best is the halloumi (vegetarian) one. The batter is lightly spiced and really good. The cheese is really delicious especially when it's hot enough. When it cools down the cheese becomes dry, and rubbery."}
{"text":"I can't say I've tried a lot of Fish & Chips in Montreal, but I see no reason to look any further. Nice portions, good variety. Fish & Chips as it should be done."}
{"text":"Really good fish and chips. The prices are on the cheap  side (With tax and tip it might go just under 14$).

You have to try the bitter shandy ! The beer one of couse. The others taste like something youve already had for a dollar or two while the beer bitter shandy tastes like something you never had before ! (Caution: its 3.50$ for the regular sized can) I do imagine that maybe this is what a butter beer tastes like (one of the mysterious food of harry potter)

So yes you might be ending with a bill of 30$ if you get everything (entree / f&c / bitter shandy)"}
{"text":"Cute little place, doesn't seat many but we sat at the counter. I had the Haddock and it was perfect. The staff was super friendly, would love to make this a regular stop if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"Staff here is super nice and those from Montreal love it. If I actually ate meat I'm sure I'd like it more, but I settled for the fried Lebanese cheese in chipotle batter.  Also interesting collection of classic british soda. I had the dandelion. Check it out if you're in old Montreal and need a greasy meal."}
{"text":"Super de l accueil au service jusqu à l assiete délicieuse et le tarif vraiment raisonnable juste génial merci pour se bon repas continuer comme ça"}
{"text":"The fish & chips is not as good as they claim and is no where close to British fish & chips. Overall the food is ok"}
{"text":"Took me back to England!

Good crispy fish, not overly oily or battered. The shrimps are also totally worth mentioning, the kind of side you savor as long as you can!

Definitely a must-go Fish&Chips place in Montreal. Try the home brewed beer, very good!

Prices are reasonable for the fish quality!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aime ce petit resto que j'ai essaye durant le lunch. Le service a ete rapide et sympatique. Les prix sont raisonnables et les assiettes genereuses et appetissantes. Les differentes panures sont originales et gouteuses. 

J'ai aime la panure a la biere guinness et celle au sirop d'erable. La salade de langoustine est delicieuse. Les frites sont bonnes.

Une belle experience gustative pour un lunch rapide."}
{"text":"I love fish n chips, and although i know you should have French food in Montreal, had to keep eating here.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was good.  The fried chocolate bar with ice cream is amazing though. I've had other fried chocolate bars at fish and chip places, but this was the only place that served it with ice cream."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chips I've had in town. And by \"best\", I mean that there's actually quite a bit of perfectly-cooked fish inside of the batter. I wasn't too crazy about their selection of batter, though. Maple syrup, orange crush, chipotle... meh. I decided to go with their Burgundy Lion batter, which was excellent.

After a big meal that is entirely fried, I probably shouldn't have had dessert. Still, their '99' ice cream was tasty.

All in all, I had good time. I went on a Thursday evening and the place was absolutely empty. I probably wouldn't go back unless I'm in the area. I prefer going to my favourite hangout, its big brother The Burgundy Lion."}
{"text":"Just ate here by my lonesome. Had the haddock, chips and a crime soda.  Delicious!  Fish was cooked excellently, batter was fantastic, chips and tartar sauce also great!  Generous portions, had to get a doggie box. Just wished I'd had room for some fried dessert!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips with a variety of fish options and a unique take on the chips (maybe quartered fingerling potatoes or something). I would have liked to try the \"Fried Whatever\" dessert, but didn't save room."}
{"text":"J'adore l'ambiance de l'endroit, on s'y sent vraiment dépaysé! L'endroit est minuscule pour le nombre de personnes qui y mangent, des chaises sont rajoutées un peu partout pour arriver à asseoir tout le monde. J'y suis allée avec mon copain et mon meilleur ami. Nous étions 3 sur une table minuscule théoriquement faites pour 2.

Le menu offre diverses variations du fish & chips. Les panures sont parfois à l'érable, parfois à la bière, etc... Et chaque panure recouvre un poisson différent. Bien intéressant. C'est un peu dommage que le goût ajouté à la panure ne goûte pas plus... (pour ne pas dire du tout).

Des bières importées sont offerts en fût. Quand j'y suis allée, après avoir passé ma commande, on m'a dit que le fût ne fonctionnait plus, mais que ça ne devrait pas être bien long... pas de problèmes, on va attendre... Et le temps a passé... La serveuse est revenue nous voir pour nous dire que les bières allaient nous être offertes gratuitement dès que le tout allait fonctionner puisque c'était très long...
On a reçu nos plats avant nos bières et finalement, les bières se sont retrouvées sur notre facture quand même...

Pour dessert, l'endroit offre des palettes de chocolat frites. Allo la friture, le gras et le sucre dans une seule bouchée! C'était assez intéressant. Surtout qu'une des palettes offertes est directement importée d'Angleterre.

Pourquoi on y va? Pour un dîner entre amis sans fla fla, une ambiance dépaysante, des plats servis dans des paniers de papiers journaux et pour l'originalité de l'endroit."}
{"text":"All Fish & Chips lovers, as John Catucci would say: \"You gotta eat here!\" Yumminess (yes this word exists) to all levels!!! Probably top 5 Fish & Chips I have tried. England friends, come on over and tell us we didn't make you proud, we also gave it a little twist which I am sure you will enjoy. All kinds of fishes possible: Cod, Haddock, Salmon, Sole, Hake, fish of the month and oh for Vegan's out there there is also the Tofu version! Enjoy :D

*** You cannot leave this place without sharing their famous dessert: \"Fried Whatever\" which is a fried chocolate bar (which vary from time to time). I know it might sound ihhhh, but trust me you will regret not trying it and those who did, you will thank me for it! Your welcome ;) 

They have 3 locations, if you can try the one in the Old-Port so then you could take a walk along the canal up to the clock tower, which is pretty amazing (in summer time specially) and you will burn off the calories! 

Pro's: 
- Very original combination of Fish & Batter (Try Sour Cream 'n Onion)
- Portion of fries is very generous 
- Vegan option: Smoked Tofu & Chipotle batter 

Con's: (If I have to find one)
- It happened twice I believe that I had very small portion of fishy, I was sad but then it passed hihi"}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try after reading so many positive reviews. I'm visiting from Vancouver where we have some outstanding Fish n chips places. 
Went to the McGill location on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was almost full.
Girlfriend and I ordered the Cod and chips each, and the orders came promptly.
Firstly, the appearance gave and indication on how the taste was going to be. The fish's batter was overcooked and was very dark. The fries were the same, overcooked, and not uniformly cut. 
Like the author of one of the reviews mentioned, it doesn't appear that they flour and egg wash the fish. The batter was slimy on the inside, and frankly put us off.
There has to be a better fish n chips place in Montreal?"}
{"text":"Brit & Chips saved my Montreal trip.

After going to many places and finding the food underwhelming, my boyfriend suggested this place as he had read about it somewhere. I'm glad he did.

This was the first thing I actually liked eating in Montreal and it was British food! 

We got the haddock (maple syrup batter) after the very friendly and helpful waitress recommended it. All the prices at brit & chips were really reasonable, even for drinks which I got an awesome cider.

Haddock wase perfectly crispy and fresh tasting and with a little lemon squeezed on it, sooo good. I tried to eat slow to savor it, but I couldn't.  Almost considered ordering another one, but we had fried twix we desert on the way.  That was really really good too.  We were super full and we don't ever really eat unhealthily, but I loveddddd everything we ate there. 

Definitely a place to check out in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. I like how they have different kinds of fish and batters. We had the salmon with Guiness  batter. Fish was very good and crisp. Service was good also."}
{"text":"This was my favorite part of the Montreal food tour. We went to the restaurant as soon as they opened and on the weekend so there was no wait. Ambience was very hip and casual. It was my first time having fish and chips. Beer battered cod was definitely the way to go. Well flavored. Fries tasted double fried as they were perfectly crispy. Prices were very reasonable. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Atlantic Canada,  I have enjoyed many fish and chip meals. This was the best I have ever had. Maple battered haddock was perfectly prepared. Homemade fries were delicious. The deep fried bounty bar was totally different than I expected - the fried coating cut some of the sweetness of the bars - it was neither too fried or too sweet. Overall, one of the best meals I have enjoyed in a long time!  Definitely will be back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town. EVEN HAS THE NEWSPAPER. 

I recommend the sole, as it's the most basic original entree. The other choices (sour cream + onion batter) are very good as well"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed after reading other reviews.  Service, location and ambiance are all good.  Fries were excellent but the fish left a bit to be desired. My wife and I both had the Haddock.  The fish was good and the batter was good but where the fish meets the batter was a bit slimy.  At first I thought that it was greasy or undercooked but it was not.  I think that the fish was not floured or egg washed before being dipped in the batter.

They do not serve tea or coffee!  I think this is to turn the tables over faster.  Really wanted a tea after dinner.   I had the \"flake and ice cream\" dessert.  TERRIBLE, do not order.  As a Scotsman, I have had this often and what should have been a flake (Cadbury's) crushed over a French vanilla ice cream with a cup of tea was a waxy piece of chocolate stuck into the side some soft ice cream with a glass of water......

I will go back as the selection of pies looked really good.  Would love if they had Scotch Pies on the menu.

Service was exceptional and prices are good.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We came in from walking around in the cold and hungry. We saw a chalkboard sign displaying their lunch special. It was lunchtime. We were lucky to come in after the rush. The server asked if we were dine in or take out and then we're promptly seated. This place is small but they have an efficient system. There is an open kitchen and service was fast. We ordered the cod chips special that comes with a glass of beer. The servings were large and we left full. We also ordered pickles to go with our meal. All items were excellent. One bonus is they serve XL ketchup packs!"}
{"text":"It's the closest thing to a solid fish & chips (aside from going to England). A touch greasy and the batters can be thick but the folks here are cheerful. Don't plan on heading out afterwards as you will smell like fried food but this place brings me back to my homeland. The scotch eggs and the mushy peas just makes me feel good:) oh and if you are feeling adventurous get a fried chocolate bar (ooeey gooey goodness!)."}
{"text":"I was staying nearby for a conference and stopped in on the first night. The fish and chips were very good and not too heavy. I had salmon. I liked how they had numerous fish and batter options. A larger beer selection would have been nice.  The service was good."}
{"text":"This really is the best fish and chips in town.  Like that they have six different types of fish, and their slightly herbed batter is light and damn tasty.  The fries are a bit above average and better than most places in Montreal.  (side note - for a city that serves up fries all over the place in many guises I find most places are below par compared to other cities I've lived)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving fish and chips and upon doing some research I found that this was the best place in Montreal. Surprisingly it worked out as the restaurant was only a 5 minute walk from my girlfriends workplace!

The place is really cute, from the outside it look like a classy pub, but when you walk in it has this old school British diner-like look to it. We sat down and picked the normal cod, a sausage roll and by recommendation the haddock with maple batter. The waitress was even nice enough to recommend that we only get one of the battered fish with chips and not both as the portion of french fries is very large. 
The sausage roll was crispy and warm and paired with the dijon mustard was great. The fish was on another planet; the batter was flaky, the fish was warm and fell apart without the use of a knife, just how it should be. The tartar sauce was also incredible. Overall just an amazing plate of fish and chips at a really nice and cozy restaurant. Both of us ate for less than 30$, so the pricing was very reasonable and worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and our first restaurant stop was this fine place. 
It's everything you'd expect for a small restaurant downtown in terms of look and class. 
Food was delicious, sizeable and tasty!
The maple haddock was definitely our fave. But even the salmon battered in Guinness just as amazing!
Fine place."}
{"text":"I had an excellent Haddock N'Chips with Maple Syrup batter served by the welcoming and friendly staff at Brit & Chips on McGill street. The crust is sweet but the maple flavor very light, though I can't imagine how to make it stronger... Nonetheless, perfect place for your quick fix of fried fish and beer, in a very tight retro style seating."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of lightly battered fish.  Small patio with table service.  Fantastic server.  Salmon, cod, haddock and other types of fish.  Fries are great.  Malt vinegar on each table."}
{"text":"This place has the best Fish and Chips in town FINS down. You would think fish & chips would be the same everywhere but this place makes all other fish eat their bubbles.

First off they have their fish of the month specials that vary month to month. A great selection of fish overall and you won't be disappointed. Prices are fair and the fries/chips are very very good. 

The service is good and they are usually always pacted at this small place in Old port. I would suggest going after their deep fried surprise dessert menu if you still have room, the fact is their fish is such a big serving that in the end you would definitely have to save room for dessert. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"$11.50 cod and chips.  Very nice  and excellent batter on the fish.  I lived in England for two years and this was just as good or better than in the UK.  We were there about 7pm on a weekday night.  I can see this being crowded at lunch or in the late evening, but we had the place to ourselves.  English spoken fluently.  The server and the cook both came out to chat with me and make sure I had everything I needed."}
{"text":"What makes this chippery THE place for fish and chips in Montreal?  The batter.  Each fish is fried in a differently flavored batter; a stroke which develops the taste of the fish itself rather than masking it.   My wife and I had cod and haddock and found both perfectly cooked with the accompanying chips better than any we've sampled elsewhere (including several chip shops in the UK and Eire).  Beer menu isn't long, but it's choice.  Service is fast, professional, and pleasant.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We walked past this place on our way to old Montreal and decided to give it a try (after dinner - don't judge). What an amazing place this turned out to be. Very cool"}
{"text":"Place is not that great.  It just seems unhealthy, very unhealthy.  The fishes are overly fried and the fries tasted burnt."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the highlight of my trip. Not only was the service quick and friendly, but the decor and environment was cozy, with a little bit of a pub yet 50's dinner vibe, in my humble opinion.

Ordered tandoori shrimp and maple syrup batter haddock with chips and smashed peas. Everything was AMAZING! The maple syrup batter was to die for, and the haddock was moist and flaky. Chips were fantastic, especially with some malt vinegar drizzled on top. Only thing I regret not ordering was some pickles cucumber to tie everything together.

Price is right and quality is superb. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The cod is addictive! I like it with the spicy sauce they have. Popcorn shrimp is very good. Worth every penny spent."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon and place was pretty empty.

Service: Waitress was nice and attentive.

Food: The bf had the cod and I had the Hake. It was good for the first few bites but it's so greasy you feel like crap before finishing the meal.

You might want to share one meal with someone else and order an appetizer."}
{"text":"Late night option is a plus. Did the veg pasty and it was a little light on content, but tasty. Sausage rolls were a bit small too but good. Could use a little more content on both."}
{"text":"Je l'avoue, je suis une anglophile finie! J'adore tout ce qui vient des Îles britanniques. C'était donc un arrêt obligatoire pour moi que d'aller au Brit & Chips.
Nous sommes allés à la nouvelle succursale sur Côte-des-Neiges, à la place de l'ancien Nouilles Dépôt. Les nouveaux locataires de l'espace ont complètement rénové le local (disons que c'était plus que dû!) avec un look moderne et épuré. La cuisine et les toilettes y sont aussi passées.
Nous sommes allés tôt, avant d'aller au cinéma. Nous avons donc eu droit à un service exceptionnel de la part des serveuses qui sont venues à plusieurs reprises nous demander si nous avions des questions sur le menu et nous expliquer les différents articles de celui-ci. Même lorsque le resto s'est rempli, le service est resté régulier, quoique j'ignore si les autres clients ont eu droit à autant d'explications sur les poissons et les panures.
Pour ma part, j'ai opté pour le merlu, panure au Orange Crush, avec chips bien sûr! Mon copain, ne mangeant pas de poisson, a pris la tarte poulet et poireaux. Tout était délicieux, bien que très lourd à cause de la panure. Disons qu'on n'a pas pris de de dessert!
J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner pour goûter aux autres plats, mais il faut faire sa réserve de légumes avant!"}
{"text":"First and last visit : quite disappointed over the small size of haddock ( not halibut) portions and the mountain of fries.  Cole slaw could have offset the heavy load of carbs, but that's extra. $14 down the drain.
For top quality fish and chips, I would highly recommend Le Chalutier in Laval. People rave about that place and justly so."}
{"text":"Great small place with a wonderful atmosphere and awesome service. The menu is diverse. Got the cod and chips with tandoori popcorn shrimp to start. So delicious. Great burgundy batter with the cod."}
{"text":"The fish was a bit too oily, and lacked a bit of saltiness. Not the best fries also, but for the price if youre hungry its okay. Would suggest to pay a lil extra and head over to comptoir 21. BEST. FISH AND CHIPS. EVER."}
{"text":"Loved the relaxed atmosphere. 
Waiting staff very friendly. 
Food was exactly as expected : delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Un petit vendredi tranquille, mon amie et moi voulons allez manger un lunch rapide et nous avons FAIM.

Il y a belle lurette déja, nous allions dans un petit shack a patate situé sur la rue McGill qui s'est maintenant magiquement transformé en shack a fish&chips. La joie dans mon cerveau a l'idée de manger du poisson frit et de la sauce tartare. Nous nous installons dehors sur la terrasse. Comme personne ne vient nous voir, nous allons directement a l'intérieur ou on nous dit qu'il y a du service sur la terrasse. La charmante serveuse nous suit a l'extérieur et nous explique le menu. 

J'opte pour le classique fish&chip de morue avec friture a la bière, mon amie choisit plutôt le saumon avec la panure a l'érable. Nous partageons une peinte de bière. Le service est courtois, rapide, souriant. 

Je ne pourrais pas vous décrire la sensation unique lorsque le poisson parfaitement frit a enveloppé mon palais. La sauce, hmmmm. J'aime vraiment les fish&chip et n'en ai jamais mangé d'aussi bons !!! a recommencer"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips.  Fast service and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was great.  Good amount of servings for the price."}
{"text":"Franchement décevant pour un resto de spécialité.
Ils sont situés dans un de mes coins préférés du Vieux-Montréal à proximité de la dernière rue éclairé au gaz de ville. On m'y accueille chaleureusement dans la langue de Molière. La décoration y est sobre, soigné et propre. 
Le menu est à ma surprise relativement varié pour un restaurant de spécialité. Mais je ne me suis pas déplacé par cette soirée orageuse pour manger un patté à la viande même si il est d'inspiration britannique. Parmi le choix de poisson offert je jette mon dévolue sur le Fish & chips à la morue bleue. J'ai été déçu de se qu'on m'a servi. Avant de continuer je dois ici faire une  parenthèse (oui encore une). Ma mère à force d'acharnement est arrivée à faire des Fish & chips aux dorées vraiment difficile à battre mais pas vraiment de style britannique. Je suis donc très exigeant et rarement satisfait de ce qu'on m'offre au resto dans ce domaine. J'ai aussi fait un voyage en Grande Bretagne et comme vous le savez quand on est pas très riche le Fish & chips est probablement la seule chose que l'on a les moyens de manger régulièrement. Je n'apprécie pas ce mélange de patte à frire croustillante à l'extérieur et mole à l'intérieur se fusionnant avec des traces d'un poisson à chaire mole et grasse. 
Pourquoi 3/5 : Même si je les comparent au Fish & chips que j'ai abondamment mangé aux UK ce qu'on m'offre ici se classe dans la moyenne sans plus. Pour moi c'est beaucoup trop gras. Après quelques bouchés je ne goutais plus rien tant mes papilles étaient saturé de matière adipeuse. Les frites était ma fois correcte, les quantités généreuses et la boîte pour emporter simple et jolie. Mais quand même je ne donnerai pas une étoile de supplémentaire pour une boîte! 

Donc j'y retournerais volontier si je suis dans le coin et qu'un ami veut essayer l'endroit, mais ne ferais jamais un détour spécialement pour goûter à leur cuisine. Pour mes rages de Fish & chips je reste fidèle au Comptoir 21."}
{"text":"My son is a fish and chip fan and orders it wherever we go if it's on the menu. \"This is#1\" he says. And it is. The fish is fresh ( we chose cod) the batter was just right and they're fast. Even the tartar sauce was perfect. You gotta try if you're in Montreal, after all, a local recommended this place to us."}
{"text":"Simple and good concept; choose your fish, and you will get what you want! Easy menu, stable quality, very friendly service (till late in the night), suitable beer for fries. probably its better to come with friends, so you can try  their various fish & chips in different flavour!"}
{"text":"Excellent Fish & Chips! Produits frais et goûteux. Le serveur a très bien exiqué le menu et le service a été impeccable. J'ai adoré leur bière maison et apprécié souper sir la terrace. Déjà hâte d'y retourner."}
{"text":"Fantastic Fish and Chips! Fresh and crispy and served with one of the best tartar sauces I have ever had. For those who love a traditional chippy this place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Coming to Montreal for a holiday? I'm sure smoked meats and poutine are on your list. However, Brit and Chips should definitely make that list as well. Located in Old Montreal, it's perfect pit stop among the attractions in the area. This is described as a québécois twist on the classic fish and chips. 

There's a perfect deal for $14 for a set meal of a soft drink, fish and chips. My friend and I got the cod and the haddock. The cod is the classic and most popular kind while the haddock has the maple batter, which made it a unique fish that's sweet and salty. 

This is legitimately one of the most flavourful and flakey fish and chips I've had in my life. The fish was soft but the batter was crispy. The chips are also crispy and a perfect match to the fish. 

Do yourself a favour and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious and a not so bad way of cheating on a diet, okay its bad but how could one resist fries cooked to perfection and crispy battered fish deep fried to perfection and if that's not good enough they even deep fry chocolate bars that's right deep fried chocolate bars .. this place is more than a must go .its a demand from the glutton king himself."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for comfort food and as I was in the area, Brit & Chips seemed like the perfect choice (not to mention that I had just spent the last 48 hours at the Jewish Hospital next door... I was hungry!!). Sooooo I ordered Cod and chips, Tandoori Popcorn Shrimp,\"99\" Ice Cream with Flake and a pint of Burgundy Lion Ale. I loooved the ice cream which was so light and so tasty, however, I disliked the rest of my order as I felt it was a bit too greasy, I could barely taste the Cod. The service was perfect and the waiters were very friendly. I'm not sure I will be going back anytime soon, but I have to admit that it's an original concept... A must try at least once :)"}
{"text":"Super glad that a Brit&Chips opened in my neighbourhood! The fish is great and they also have tasty pies and pastries. And good beer, of course. I've been there for lunch a couple of times already and it seems to be getting popular. Hopefully the owners will adjust to that and hire more staff. Today at 1pm they had only 1 waitress to serve all tables and the place was full. She was very nice and was clearly doing her best but it wasn't ideal."}
{"text":"An excellent fish'n chips place, probably one of the best in Montreal.

L'endroit est comfortable et relativement tranquille, le serveur est sympa aussi"}
{"text":"Prior to eating at this joint, I could not tell you the last time I had fish and chips.... maybe 10 years ago... I am old. I am glad this was my reintroduction to fish and chips..  the food really good.  The service was friendly/fast.   While the food is made fresh, it does have a fast food feeling to it.... its not a place to go for a nice evening on the town.  However, if you are looking for some tasty fish and chips... hit this spot."}
{"text":"The food here was good, pretty straight forward menu. The prices are reasonable but for some dishes I find it a bit pricy. The service could of been better but at the same time the waitres was the only one working for both the outside and inside."}
{"text":"Fine, that's not the most original tagline, but fish and chips are far from original. They've been a staple in London since the late 1800s, and have been a personal family favourite in my home since I was about 8.


Brit & Chips got off to a rough start but it was smooth sailing by the time we got our food.

The patio was full so we headed inside.  The server who greeted us seemed cranky. But we grabbed a seat anyway and ordered. By the end, our server had gone from zero to hero. 

It seems we got there just in time (around 6:00 pm) because it filled up and before you know it, there was a long line. Our server's mood brightened and he started making jokes and smiling. He didn't even charge my sister for fries. You see, she had ordered just a serving of the cod (burgundy batter), but then I reminded her that I don't like sharing fries. So she asked him for a side order just before our dishes were served.

I had the haddock (maple syrup batter) and we shared the tandoori popcorn shrimp.

It's a little more expensive at $9.50 (for two pieces, $11.00 if you add chips) than I'm used to paying, but well worth it. The batters were tasty and crispy. I liked the cod better, my sister the haddock - good thing we shared. Both fish were meaty and tender, and with so many choices (salmon, hake and the fish of the day) share with friends and try them all. Except the fries, they're so yummy you'll want your own serving. 

I could dedicate an entire post to their tartar sauce - but I won't. It was delish - creamy, tangy, fresh with a hint of dill. Yum.

My sister and I would both go back, but we'd probably skip the popcorn shrimp and try the mashed peas instead. So Brit."}
{"text":"British fish and chips in a predominantly French Canadian province! The name of the place is pretty simple and self-explanatory.

HADDOCK (maple syrup batter) - Acts like a slightly sweet batter. The maple flavor gets lost a bit in the fried grease.

SOLE (sour cream and onion batter) - WOW. If you have a weakness for sour cream and onion junk food, then GET THIS. You get the flavor immediately on the first bite.

Hake (orange crush batter) - One of the most curious types of batter out of the selection. We opted for the half portion ($6) to try this out which was the right choice over the full portion. The flavor is only mildly sweet won't the most bare flavor of orange soda present.

Shrimp Scampi Salad - The shrimp is flavored with herbs and abundant throughout the salad. The salad itself isn't too special. It's not like you have a decent amount of other options if don't want the chips portion with your fish order. Speaking of the chips, they're decent also with a bit of salt.

Overall a good change up of cuisine located in Old Montreal. This place won't break your tourist wallet and prices are super cheap for fish. Everything is fried crispy, and well portioned, definitely recommend (if you're tired of poutine)."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Absolutely the best fish and chips on this side of the ocean 

Don't understand why the restaurant was almost empty at dinner time. 

Great service."}
{"text":"The british invasion in Montreal shows no sign of stopping. Brit & Chips owned by the same group as The Burgundy Lion Pub, has taken over the once coveted Mc Gill Hot Dog, and opened its doors to offer locals a more authentic fish and chips experience. With four staple fish options to combine with chips (british equivalent of french fries) they are well beyond most seafood spots in town.

The menu also features Tandoori popcorn shrimp, a variety of pasties and other British foods including pork pies, and sausage rolls.

A healthy option for those avoiding the deep fried page on the menu is the Seafood salad, which is a healthy portion at a great price.

Where the Burgundy Lion has the pub atmosphere dialed in, Brit & Chips has the food perfectly locked in. For lunch or dinner the food is fresh, tasty, and substantial. It's also great for sharing.

Dead center of the old port business district, expect it to be busy during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall but good service and good food. Some of the best fish and chips I've ever had. Also tried the tandoori shrimp snack which was excellent."}
{"text":"No complaints, really great fish & chips. Fries were good and crispy. Fish was nice, moist, and soft. Quick service as well!

[ My Order ] : Sour-Cream Sole + Chips"}
{"text":"Très bon fish'n chips... faudra revenir pour essayer les différents poissons et saveurs!"}
{"text":"The mushy peas were, if I may, \"brilliant,\" with a vibrant flavor better than several comparable versions we'd tried in the UK. Both the cod and the haddock were delicious --the cod's batter especially won us over. We also lost our Scotch Egg virginity here, and it was everything we'd hoped it'd be.

What we didn't like were a couple of older, frumpy American ladies behind us loudly \"educating\" two poor young Montreal students about the state of U.S. affairs in an obnoxiously distorted, one-sided fashion, completely bereft of facts. They exemplified everything awful about American tourists."}
{"text":"Good place to grab lunch. Authentic fish & chips with a French Canadian twist to it. Services is good. Waitress spend time to explain to us the catch of the month and different batter they have. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Why does beer taste so good with fried food? The fish and chips though, were really good at Brit and Chips. Whoever, thought of fried food with more fried food was a genius - probably was the brits as they were smart enough to take over the world. But yeah, would recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish! Had the cod - deep fried to the point of super crunchiness. Really tasty, nop notch fried fish. Chips were ok, but fish is to die for."}
{"text":"So what do you do when you are visiting Montreal for the first time and you are hungry since you haven't eaten lunch? Try to find a lunch place is what you do. The weapon of choice is the Yelp app, of course. 

This place was not our first choice. The place we chose was closed for lunch service so we stumbled to Brit & Chips as it was within walking distance from where we were. 

I didn't know anything about this place beforehand nor did I bookmarked this place on Yelp. When my Yelp friends started commenting about the different batters, I realize what was the specialty of this place. They use different batters for their fish using local styles and flavours. 

The place is not very big and seating and space is limited. There's only one big table for a group at the back and two people tables alongside. The rest of the seats are located in the bar like setup. 

My wife, daughter and I decided to go for the $14 combo of fish, chips and a soft drink. There's a $18.50 combo with fish, chips and a burgundy light ale. My wife and daughter chose the Cod with the burgundy batter while I went for the Haddock with the maple syrup batter. 

I loved my fish along with the fries. The batter was crispy while the fish inside was tender. I loved the Tartar sauce too. However, my wife and daughter were not impressed with their fish, but all 3 of us agreed that their chips were one of the best we had. 

Service was minimal but efficient. Once you are done, go to the front to pay. 

I wish Toronto had a place like this. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm by no means a fish and chips connoisseur, but this place's are pretty good by my standards. The size of the bill and the ambiance are somewhere between a fast food joint and a pub."}
{"text":"When I think of fish and chips, I am reminded of being a kid and throwing some Morton's or Van De Camp's frozen fish sticks in the toaster oven. And dipping them in ketchup. Yes, my standards were low, but mom worked late and I was a hungry boy. For a treat, sometimes my mom would take me to an iconic place in Los Angeles (where I grew up) called Pioneer Chicken, where in addition to their fried chicken, they served fish and chips. And let me jus say, it wasn't a huge upgrade from the frozen fish sticks. 

Well I've been a grown up for some time now, and I realized a few years ago that I needed to enhance my fish and chip experiences. Atlantic Chip Shop in Brooklyn helped set a standard for me. Comptoir 21 in Mile End was the first place in Montreal to help me fulfill that craving. And luckily for me, a place like this exists a few blocks from my place: Brit & Chips. 

I arrived on an Friday afternoon, and it was pretty mellow. The server was super sweet and helpful, suggesting the classic Cod in burgundy batter, their most popular. And I could see why. Big pieces of cod, crispy thick batter, fries (ahem, chips) cooked just right. The tartar sauce had a hint of horseradish which I appreciated as well. At first glance, two pieces of fish might not seem like a lot, but I felt myself getting full maybe halfway into my meal. But I buckled down and scarfed it all up :)

All in all, a satisfying, quality meal. Can't wait to return and try the other plates."}
{"text":"We tried the vegetarian halloumi & chips, with a salad and mushy peas. It was delicious! The portions were great for 2 to share and the halloumi was not drenched in oil, but remained fresh and tasty. A great experience. Could have more seating or a terrace for the summer, but overall will definitely be going back for the portions and great taste."}

{"text":"There where ants in my fish and chips, never went back. Sad since so many of my coworkers raved about this location."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly and did a great job refilling our drinks.  Went for the fish and chips and it was predictably greasy.  But my problem was that the oil was obviously old and the fish, fritters and fries were all dark brown.  When food is fried in fresh oil, batter will be much lighter in color."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The food is great, the portions are very generous. The menu is simple and effective. The service is great, the waiters are always available and attentive. The prices are acceptable, especially considering that you will leave feeling full and happy. Make sure to arrive early because there are a lot of people during peak hours. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and are looking for great fish and chips."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because the cod was delicious - once I scooped it out of its burnt batter shell - but I can't find anything else positive to say.

Trust your first instinct when you think, how good a chippy are you likely to find in Montreal? I wanted to like this place; I wanted to find a better value than the surrounding bistros. I wanted the batter to be golden and just crispy, not close to burnt, and definitely cooked in fresh oil. The vanilla ice cream with chocolate flake was dull as the economy flavor from the supermarket."}
{"text":"Belle découverte que ce resto! Trouvez par hasard après une marche dans le vieux, Brits &Chips est apparue comme une vision. J'adore les fish&chips mais je trouve habituellement ceux servis aux restaurants fades, huileux et douteux dans certains cas. Mais pas aux Brits &Chips. 
Les choix de panures sont intéressantes et l'ont sent la fraîcheur du poisson qui font littéralement sous la dents. Le service est convivial et rapide et les desserts décadent (plusieurs choix de paillettes de chocolats frites). On sait que l'on raccourcis sont espérance de vie en mangeant au Brits &Chips mais c'est pas grave, parce que ça en valait la peine!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this the best fish and chips place in Montreal, but in reality is there really that much competition here?

No.

This was the only fish and chips place I saw on my entire trip, and I always took the metro or walked.

That said it was good.

Nice batter, nice fish.

But, if you're comparing this place to England, then it would be a different flavor.

Here they have maple, sour cream, fried bars, a more modern taste on the classic dish."}
{"text":"A good find during my visit to Montreal. At this place you will find a choice of fried fish and fries. No complicated choices to make. Everyone at my table ordered something different and we liked our food. I don't eat fried food often but was still pleased with my purchase."}
{"text":"This place is not opened by Brits, but rather it's a local Brit-inspired chippie. Service is great, and they have a variety of fish and batter to choose from.  They even have a version using Halloumi cheese for vegetarians!! 

We tried a few varieties (the waitress let us know that we can get one fillet as a half order).  Batter wise, I like the Sour Cream 'n Onion the best.  Burgandy is nice too, but while the maple syrup one is very popular, I don't really like the sweetness of it.  As for the fish, we prefer the firmer texture of cod and haddock over the sole.  That said, we did enjoy everything."}
{"text":"What's a yogi to do after an intense 90-minute yoga class? Hit up Brit & Chips, of course! I mean, what's the point of sweating my a$$ off doing Power yoga if I can't treat myself to some deep-fried goodness after? 

I ordered the Haddock, which was deep-fried in a maple syrup batter. It was deeeeee-licious! I was a little worried that the maple syrup would cause the batter to be too sweet but the truth is that I barely tasted it. In fact, if I didn't specifically know that there was maple syrup in there, I'd never have guessed. NOW: the fish was so very flaky and moist and well, perfect. The batter was plentiful, yet light and crispy. The whole damn concoction was simply amazing and, in my opinion, the ratio of fish to batter (or vice versa) was perfect. Bonus? The homemade tartar sauce had a nice little bite to it as well. Tasty.  

As for the chips - well, this is a huge compliment where I come from: they reminded me of the ones my mum makes at home. Nice and thick, golden and not too fried, and thus, not at all oily or greasy. I'm not an expert but these fries were not cooked in week-old oil. Or maybe they were and they're just really good at hiding it. Who knows? In any case, the lot (fish, chips and all) were served upon newspaper, in a pie plate. I finished off the night with a .99 cone topped with one of my favorites: Flake. Noms.

The restaurant itself is small, but they do have a terrace that you can enjoy as long as you don't mind the pedestrian traffic. They have a fairly extensive menu for such a small joint as well, so go check'em out!"}
{"text":"Great location, near Concordia University.

Super clean with modern and simple decor.

Friendly and amiable service. 

Menu is extensive with fish and chips, and many more items. Reasonable prices.

Shrimp Popcorn Poutine ordered; a big portion that I hard time to finish it. A whole dish was good except the cheese was too salty. Soda are watered down sadly. 

Overall, a great restaurant with superb quick service."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff. Nothing special. Your fried fish and chips. Seems pretty common."}
{"text":"Excellent chippie! Wasn't sure what to expect from the maple battered haddock but was pleasantly surprised.  The maple flavor was very subtle and didn't detract from the mildness of the fish.  The quality of fish was impressive my haddock fillet was fresh and meaty.  We especially enjoyed the chips--it's hard to find proper chips outside of Britain but these came very close.  The Mystique cider is excellent and well  worth trying.  Portion sizes are reasonable and service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"On a très bien mangé! J'ai commandé le poisson avec la panure de doritos et jalapeños et c'était vraiment bon!!! Ça coute 12'5$ deux morceaux de poisson et les frites. Pas mal de choix de poissons et de panures différentes. On a aussi commandé une pinte de burgundy (c'est la seule qu'ils ont en fut, le reste c'était en bouteilles). C'est un resto plutot grand. Je n'irai pas à un autre resto pour un fish and chips!"}

We had the fish of the day which was the sole in Cajun batter. Then we had the sole in their regular batter. My friend had the cod which was delicious. And another friend had the salmon filet which was okay. 

The scotch eggs were just okay. We also had the fritters which I'm not too big of a fan of fritters. 
But overall the food was good service was friendly. We definitely are too much! I'd love to come back for some more of the cod.."}

 No complaints, nothing to rave about. If you like fish and chips, this is good fish and chips. Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Just love this place. Fast and friendly service. Great prices and many choices. Will be going back"}
{"text":"I had fish and chips the first time at Brit & Chips, and I must say it's a wonderful thing! 

This restaurant offers very interesting batter flavors and many kinds of fish. The food is fresh out of the fyer, portions are generous and prices affordable. The creamy dips are also delicious, both for the fish and the fries. If eating too much fried food makes you feel sluggish/stuffy, you can try adding lemon juice or vinegar (it helps a bit). Apart from the fish, we also tried their Tandoori Popcorn Shrimp, which was good, but nothing special. I recommend trying their Ben Shaws sodas - again, they have interesting flavors, such as Dandelion&Burdock and Bitter Shandy.

Really happy they added a location on Maisonneuve!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of everything British; music, cars, motorcycles and beer. Brits & Chips is a great find. The star here is the freshness of the fish. I had the haddock with maple batter. The haddock was so fresh and flaky it couldn't stay together. The batter was light with a hint of maple flavour. The chips (fries on this side of the pond) were great too. Once again proving that fresh ingredients are key even in the simplest of dishes.

For starters, I shared with my family the popcorn shrimp which had a touch of spiciness even my kids devoured without complaining about the heat. The sausage roll was good, but not a as big as a hit as the haddock and shrimps.

Finally, we did not have any sinful deep-fried mars bars of any sweet deep-fried dessert, but we did really enjoy their line of Ben Shaw soft drinks. We shared a Shandy and a Cream soda and was blown away by them! The Cream soda was subtle without being overly sweet. If anyone knows where to find these in a specialty grocery store please yelp me!

Ultimately, if you want the best deep-fried fish in the city this is the place. Like they say in the UK- It's the Dog's Bollocks!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch with my boyfriend. I ordered the Sole and he ordered the Salmon.

Pros: 
Location (Near Concordia)
Portions (waaaaayyyy too much food, they give you two pieces of fish!)
Price
Fast and Friendly Service
Succinct Menu 
Good Fish and Chips + Drink combo

Even with all these positive points, the taste just wasn't all there. I felt like the fries were kinda boring, their tartar sauce too pickle-y, and their batter not airy enough. The more I ate, the more I felt weighed down by the food. Usually, the fried portion of Fish and Chips is nice and fluffy, I just didn't get that here. I understand that it is fried food and fries so it makes sense that it's heavy, but I've had fish and chips that didn't leave me feeling greasy.

It's a real shame because this place is so awesome! I am going to visit again and try something else."}
{"text":"Visited twice, the first time I had the classic cod and Burgundy Lion batter. I was pleased that the chips were as close to proper British chips that I've had in North America. The fish was light and flakey and the batter was golden and crispy. 

On my second visit I opted for one of their chicken and leek pie. (The waitress did mention that it was their fish they were famous for). Sadly the pie was not to the standards of the fish. The centre was very dry and unappetizing. 

One fun and unique thing about Brit and Chips is their chocolate bar and crisp selection. Authentic products right from the UK. They also offer cider if you want a truly British experience!

Both times I have been they have had deep fried chocolate bars on the menu. Get them. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal! I orders the Haddock cooked in maple batter and my wife ordered the fish that came in the sour cream and onion batter. The fish was crisp and fresh out of the grease. Homemade tarter sauce was on point and the beer on tap paired nicely. Although it was only two pieces and fries, we both left full and satisfied. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  A *best ever* for us....

Simple perfection, the menu includes many types of fish, pies and Brit items.

While the summer rain fell outside, we opted for the Cod and Chips, and the Tandoori  Shrimp to share.

This was the right amount of food for two....

Cod and Chips...melt in your mouth fish, phenomenal crust, cooked just right.  Chips were not from the freezer....yum!!

Tandoori Shrimp....warm mild flavor, so good!!

Our last dining experience in beautiful Montreal was without a doubt my favorite!"}
{"text":"Yep, this is the place to go for fish and chips in Montreal. So many places use frozen fish filets, but here you get fresh, hand-battered, deep fried goodness every time - you can even see them drop it. I love the Maple Haddock, and their tangy tartar sauce is pretty delicious as well. Fries are pretty standard, haven't had an over-done one.
I've tried the popcorn shrimp which had a nice tandoori-esque spice to them, and were not undercooked. I've also had a delicious steak pastie, and tried a deep fried peanut butter cup (there are 3 in an order, way too much for one person alone). The pickled onions were strong, and vinegary, and cut though the fattiness of the fried items. 
They also do takeout in cute little newspaper print boxes, and even gave us a free reusable bag since we bought so much XD
So TL;DR: Very good :)"}
{"text":"Good place to go and hang out with friends. Really nice ambience. I've been there a few times. Got the poutine when it was poutine week (not worth it in my opinion) and went with the fish of the month the other times. Honestly, fish & chips kind of all taste the same to me, regardless of fish/restaurant. This is still a cute place tho!"}
{"text":"Small place but with plenty of choices on the batters that you will combine with the type of fish that you like. Every time I go there, I always get a fresh fish"}
{"text":"Brit & Chips wasn't bad at all. The fish was fresh, and they have several varieties of fish and batters. I don't know that I would go out of my way to eat there again, though. It's good, but not great. For some reason the server was really pushing the mushy peas, as if they were some kind of delicacy."}
{"text":"I'm writing my review based on a few visits here in the old port of Montreal this summer. There is a small seating patio out front of the restaurant on rue Mc Gill; if you prefer eating inside there are very few booth style tables. Takeout is a great option too! 
Well the first time I tried them I had the \"algefin\" haddock is what it is. OMG! Amazing - huge portion of fish & chips in a cute fake newspaper box(looked traditional enough) cause who remembers old school fish n chips when they actually used real newspapers to wrap your fish n chips. Anyway the fish was thick & moist- 
You also pick what type of batter you want them to fry your fish in-it's on the menu board for takeout -kool! 
Another few times I had the halibut n chips- another winner! Oh but this time my fish was wrapped in \"fake\" newspaper - luv it! 
I can't wait to go back to Montreal in the old port just so I can eat at this place. No complaints, staff is bilingual & friendly and the price point is typical for a fish and chips place. They have other types of fish & foods to choose from so if you're with some friends who don't dine on pescatarian food, no worries they have you covered. 
Adieu pour maintenant"}
{"text":"Have eaten at many fish and chips around the world. For Montreal it's very good. Compared to England or Nova Scotia, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"ah, its like only the best fish and chips on the planet - they even have salmon fish and chips, i'm not kidding.  one of the best meals ive eaten anywhere on the planet"}
{"text":"Wow! This was the best fish & chip I've ever had. They had a October special which was sole with a squash batter. On top there was a yummy salty feta crumble. Talk about bringing fish & chips to the next level.  Sit down with service at the table and totally unpretentious. Great music piping through speakers and friendly quick service. What more can you ask? Not much! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. The fish and chips are done brilliant, and the appetizers and sides are excellent as well. Service was solid, but we didn't expect much anyway. This is a very casual eatery. 

Standouts: Guinness salmon (crispy AND moist as can be), maple-batter haddock, tandoori shrimp. Scotch egg was an interesting side, and the Burgundy Lion beer is crisp and cheap. 

Our 2nd time here, we tried a deep-fried something a la mode. Don't remember the name of the chocolate (there was cherry in the middle), but it was heart-stoppingly awesome. 

Even the chips are unique, greasy little nuggets of joy. 

A great casual eatery to do a bit of calorie splurging."}
{"text":"I'm a Brit so you can take this review to the bank.

I grew up on a stable diet of fish and chips from my local \"chippy\" and moving to Canada I missed the experience and taste of good quality fish and chips. No matter where you go in North America I feel like I am always served fish and fries instead of a proper chip. Then I found Brit n chips in Montreal!

I've been there a few times but only got round to reviewing it after my visit today. I went in at lunch time and the place was packed but staff still said hello to me and service was super speedy. On this occasion I ordered a portion of cod and chips and a portion of salmon and chips. I also had a side of mushy peas which are pretty authentic and true to what you'd find in good old Blighty. 

The fish is always cooked expertly and the variety of batters on offer is excellent. For instance, my salmon was cooked in a Guiness batter. 

As for the chips they are actual chips and not fries. They are lightly salted by the staff after cooking and served in faux newspaper which is a very nice touch. Tartar sauce and lemon comes included with the meal but you can ask for extra if needed.

Overall I couldn't speak highly enough of this excellent tribute to fine British cuisine!"}
{"text":"Impressed by what Brit & Chips does: Fish & Chips. If you want Fish & Chips, and lots of different, specialized options in fish and batters, come here! If you're a purist, the menu might anger you, but I thought the options were a fun twist to fish & chips and made sure to ask the wait staff for the best combinations. Unsurprisingly, batter is heavy, you come out full and greasy, but thats understood when you go to an exclusively fish & chips restaurant!"}
{"text":"After living in Calgary for the past year I was anxious to enjoy some decent fish and chips. When I learned of Brit and Chips during my long weekend trip to Montreal I knew I had to check it out.
I have to say I was suitably impressed. It reminded me of the Fish and Chips back in Australia! If you are up for some Fish and Chips in Montreal then this has to be on the top of your list."}
{"text":"Located on Mcgill Street in Old Montreal (not to be confused with Mcgill College), I went over to Brit & Chips for lunch and had the Cod with Burgundy batter. So good. I am a huge fan of fish 'n chips to begin with so I am a bit of an easy sell. What this place has over other spots is the variety of different types of fish and batters they offer their clients. When I go, I usually go with the cod or haddock but I am told that the Sole and the Salmon are amazing. The chips too, I must say, are great.

You can get beer or wine but I usually find that I am WAYYYYY too bloated after if I grab a brew or two so I usually stick to water. So heavy. So greasy. So good. If you are a fan of fish 'n chips, check this spot out.

***They have deep fried chocolate bars. It seems to be a rotating menu. I have not had them yet since, again, I am usually really full by the end of my meal but I am told that they too are good."}
{"text":"Really, REALLY, good British pub food. Inexpensive and tasty. I actually ate here twice in one day. 

For lunch I had the steak and ale pie with a large 16 oz Fuller;s English Pride.  The pastry was flaky and excellent.  Lots of meat and a nice sauce with a tang to it.  Kinda like A1 sauce, but better.

Later I decided to stop back by for dinner.  I had the onion and cheese pastie, which was fabulous.  Wish it was a bit bigger though.  Washed it down with a large Lion Burgundy ale.

The place is a bit bright and the music is a little off-putting.  Bon Jovi and U2.  Not quite what was expected for ambiance, but the counter help is really nice.  I'm sure I'll be back before the end of the week."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips!! Super accueil et service. Malheureusement étant enceinte et prise de nausée au milieu de mon repas je n'ai pu finir. La serveuse m'a gentiment fait un doggy bag. Et même réchauffé au four c'était excellent au petit déjeuner le lendemain matin."}
{"text":"I'd been warned that Brit & Chips wasn't all it was cracked up to be, but being in the area closer to 8 p.m., I decided that it was too late to venture farther for food.  I should have kept walking.

I ordered the Orange Crush Hake and Chips from the counter, since it wasn't immediately apparent if it was a place with table service, but when the order was put in for takeout, I quickly asked if I could eat there instead.  The cashier (and server as I soon found out) was  obliging and quickly told the cooks that it was eat-in.  The whole transaction was in French (which can often make a difference in Montreal).

The service was remarkably fast in getting the food to the table, but after that, the experience went downhill.  Although it looked great to start with, the food was incredibly bland, no matter how much lemon and tartar sauce I used.  I was okay that the server ignored me the whole time I was there (the \"extra mile\" would have been to offer water and check in).  With eating out in restaurants much more frequently, I'm inclined to tip generously for good service (because the difference has become much more apparent), but I'll only do that on the way out when I've judged the service.  I don't feel like anyone really did a good job, and when they all ignored me on the way out, suddenly I wasn't inclined to part with any more money.  (I totally had it ready in my pocket for the tip basket too.)

When I left, I felt a funny feeling in my throat (definitely from the food), but today it's actually a full-blown sore throat.

I usually give glowing reviews but this restaurant needs the feedback.  I think people will be more forgiving of bad food if the service is great, but usually those go hand in hand, so maybe the staff have given up.  And even if that was a one-off night, a customer in the restaurant is still a person with money to part with, right up until they leave your establishment."}
{"text":"I was on a food tour in Montreal and they gave us a sample, I got one piece of cod, chips, and tarter sauce....OMG. My boyfriend is Scottish and my mom is English so I know good fish and chips. My boyfriend and I LOVED it!!! I would come here every time I'm in Montreal (: Great place !"}
{"text":"I was born in London and spent the majority of my summers on the southwest coast of England visiting my aunts and indulging in some fondly-remembered fish n chips. I remember going into one of those family-owned chippers every summer and ordering up crispy and vinegar-doused-but-slimy-inside pieces of plaice and chips wrapped in a newspaper. Brit & Chips brought me a little bit closer to home and my heart beats faster because of it. I also tried the scotch egg (pretty good) and the sausage roll (if anyone knows me, the sausage roll is the most amazing and glorious snack food known to homo sapiens)...the puff pastry was spot on, the sausage itself a little off, but close enough.  Thank you Brit and Chips for your unexpected joy!!!"}
{"text":"For our first night in Old Montreal, my wife and I just wanted something quick and somewhat familiar to eat. We were rewarded with an unexpectedly good meal at Brit & Chips.

Between us we had the sole with sour cream and onion batter, as well as the halibut with maple syrup batter. The fish was well-cooked, and the batter was not overly thick. We both loved our fish, and the \"chippies\" were good as well.

The restaurant was cramped but clean, and the staff was very friendly. You essentially come here for the food, not necessarily the atmosphere. If you even think you like fried fish, you will love this place. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very much a no frills, cozy, place to satisfy your fish and chips cravings. I stopped by as a solo traveler looking for an affordable seafood option in Montreal. I got the cod and chips and was pleasantly surprised. The fish was cooked perfectly and they also nailed the all important fish to batter ratio. The menu was small but included the classic hits like mushy peas and pints of Québécois beers."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted something simple on our last night in town and so we stopped in.  It was a great meal.  We both had the Cod and Chips.  I had a nice pint of the Burgandy Lion Ale and it was fantastic.

Next time I would like to try some of the other dishes--like the mushy peas or one of the meat pies--they all looked great.

Luckily, I didnt run into any frumpy American ladies, but I did have a nice conversation with the friendly waitress.  (The service people in Montreal are some of the friendliest I have ever met.)"}
{"text":"wow just wow! I have had my fair share of fish and chips all over the world and have found that there are a couple criteria that the dish needs to meet for me.
1)fluffyness
2)crispyness
3) moistness 

this place hit the trifecta! I had haddock (being a bostonian, it was hard for me to order haddock) and was not disappointed. This is such a great mini-chain (couple of locations) and they only have a few things on the menu but they have perfected those items. I would love to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Probably my favourite British fish and chips in Montreal. The price is reasonable, and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you have celiac disease please do not order their gluten free dish!  They use the same deep fryer as for their gluten dishes!

This was really misleading, dangerous, and unfortunate.  I hope none of their clientele gets sick. :("}
{"text":"Really liked this place. The waitress was friendly and took the time to answer questions. Lots of different choices of batters and fish -- even had a delicious vegetarian version of fish (actually harloumi cheese) that was battered. The servings were plentiful and the there was one beer on tap and several other bottled choices. The mushy peas were good. The atmosphere was very casual, and the prices were reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"fish & chips tasted amazing! good service. the waitress was nice. came here in January when it was freezing cold (tourists from NYC). we were the only ones in the restaurant and not a soul to be seen outside. will come back though if ever visit montreal!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say that fish and chips usually make me feel nauseous before I've finished what's on my plate. Just way too much grease. Not so here - the batter and chips were both crispy and light. I went for the standard fare - cod and chips in the house batter. Next time I'll try something a little bit more adventurous. The staff was friendly too, which was a bonus. I took off one star because the pieces of fish were a little small for the price. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Clean, fast and easy going service qualifies this place as good 'fast-food' in Montreal.  Salads are fairly portioned and the fish+chips was more than enough for me to eat on its own.  I'd be happy to go back here if I was in the area on my next trip into Montreal ;)"}
{"text":"It was on a cold wintery day, my first winter in Montreal and I was missing home terribly (I am from the UK). I told my husband I really felt like some \"chips\" so he got me a bag of Lays originals :/ After making it clear that chips in the UK = fat fries/potatoes, that evening, after a little research, he discovered Brit and Chips. We went for a small walk, not too far by the old port and as soon as we were unable to bear the cold, rushed to this very cute and cosy restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised to see the traditional 'chippy' interior with the metal counters and deep fryers exactly as if it were in the UK! We had amazing cod fish fried in tasty batter and the chips tasted as if I was having them back home... I was in heaven! I couldn't even believe that just like the chippies in Scotland, they even did deep fried chocolate bars! My husband was just too curious and ordered a snickers one. It was delicious!

I love how they have put a twist to the traditional British chippy by giving it a local touch.. By introducing various batter flavours (such as maple syrup) different deep fried chocolates than the original Mars bars and adding sauces. There is a lot of choice but you can even go there for a good old British cuppa! They also do the famous '99' Ice cream which I cannot wait to try out in Summer! 

Overall we both loved this place and I will probably be back there soon when I am feeling homesick! :)"}
{"text":"We walked in the pouring rain to have lunch here. To say it was worth it is a massive understatement! By far our favorite place we ate on our trip! As New Englanders, we've had our fair share of fish and chips, this gave everything we've had on the coast a run for its money! We had(and shared) the cod(burgundy batter), haddock(maple syrup batter), and the sole(sour cream and onion batter). It was all AMAZING! Everyone said their favorite was the one they ordered. I had the maple syrup batter and it was wonderful! Not only are the batters delicious, but the fish is cooked to perfection! The tartar sauce is a great compliment to the dish as well! There is a good amount of seating with a couple tables inside and out and good bar space inside. We finished our meal with a fried 'whatever' which we chose kit kat and werent disappointed! 

Brit and Chips is a must for Montreal visits!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, fish is so fresh, great atmosphere!

The \"$$\" from Yelp fooled me, for a fish & chips is C$12.5, I think it is a very reasonable price! The place is packed with people during lunch hour and a lot of people waited for their take-out orders, you can tell it is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"The fish & chips gave us life after a long trip! The fries were so gooood and the fish was nice and crispy! The beer was good as well! I would definitely say that this meal was as good as the one in London!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets when it comes to fish and chips in Montréal. As someone who has been to the UK and had a fair share of fish and chips while there, I can say without a doubt that Brit & Chips does the classic staple justice on many fronts.

I decided to go with the standard choice of cod coated in a Burgundy batter with chips as well as a pint of Burgundy Lion on the side. Brought out steaming hot and fresh from the fryer and served on newspaper, I was salivating in anticipation and excitement, and it did not disappoint. The fish was fried to a perfect crisp, even to the point where I could hear the crunch after biting into it. It was also juicy and went along amazingly with the tartar sauce and lemon, creating a savory, creamy, and tangy experience all in one bite. The chips were cut into decently thick slices and were soft but not soggy and maintained an edge to that differentiated them from your typical fries. The Burgundy Lion beer complemented the fish very nicely and I could actually stomach tasting it unlike most beers, and I could see myself drinking it voluntarily on a regular basis (not trying to sound like an alcoholic or anything).

I have also been to Comptoir 21 for fish and chips, but I have to say that Brit & Chips wins the battle hands down. The offerings overall stay way more true to what you would actually get in the UK, and it shows in the quality of the food and drinks. I would definitely come back here again with friends so I can spread the love for this place and make it more known because that's what it most definitely deserves."}
{"text":"Excellent Fish and chips ! Ambiance anglaise, mais très simple! La bière en fut Burgundy est excellente!"}
{"text":"Love the place, old school diner setting. Quick service, a great selection of different type of Fish&Chips combos. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Le Brit & Chips ne déçoit jamais. Je passe souvent devant, j'ai toujours envie d'y entrer.

J'ai visité quelques fois la succursale Côte-des-Neiges et une fois celle de McGill (pour soulager une grosse peine en l'étouffant dans la panure, ce fut un moment exceptionnellement réconfortant). Même constat: c'est excellent. Excellent service, excellents repas, bon choix de bières en bouteille. Le décor est vraiment bien. En hiver, par contre, il fait un peu froid à l'intérieur lorsqu'on est à l'avant du resto. 

Un repas au Brit & Chips, c'est l'occasion parfaite d'avaler cette dose de poisson nécessaire que ta mère mettait toujours au menu quand tu étais plus jeune et que tu négliges fortement maintenant que tu habites en appart avec tes copains. Je te jure, c'est loin de goûter le mal de coeur et l'huile de foie de morue. 

À mon avis, c'est particulièrement agréable d'y aller entre amis, tu peux donc amener tes colocs. Il y a de l'espace, profitons-en!"}
{"text":"Ver nice place, great food, perfect atmosphere. Go there, you will not regret!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a British restaurant. 

I had \"Fish of the Month\" + chips, pork pie, and cod fish cake. 

The fish cake sucks. But the fish of the month is yummy. Overall it is ok except the food is too expensive."}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips in town... Located on Rue McGill, Brit & Chips claims to be expert in English Cuisine with a hint of  Quebecois spice to it . There's a notion bout English people in North America - \"All they eat is fish & chips\". As ignorant as it seems, I'd say if  fish & chips are as yummy as what you get at B&C, I'd eat em daily too. The fish here is always fresh & flaky. Chips are really good. Not too greasy. They have a few English as well as French beer's. Their Pie's are good too. I'm a fan of the Pork pie.  Also the popcorn shrimp is yummy. Definitely worth a visit. 

P.S :- This place gets real busy during lunch


Food -  Good
Service - Friendly
Ambiance - Casual
Worth the money - Hell Yeah"}
{"text":"Very nice place for authentic uk fish. Cod was best. Chips are to die for best i have had in a while"}
{"text":"We wanted quick indulgent fish and chips and that's exactly what was delivered.  The maple batter added a interesting twist."}
{"text":"Best Fish n'Chips I've had yet in Montreal, lost of good stuff to eat here, including curried popcorn shrimp and scotch eggs.
The Steak and Ale pie was also great with a pickle."}
{"text":"So just devoured a fish (cod) and chips dinner from this place. As a girl that grew up in England and really knows good fish and chips, this place is pretty decent. Fish was the better part of the duet. Crispy and light batter that contained a load of flavor. Hard to find a well battered fish like this in Texas. 
Now the chips on the other hand were better than most, but don't expect them to be like the ones you might have grown up on from the neighborhood fish n chip shop. (If you grew up in the U.K.) Still searching."}
{"text":"Un fish and chips qui s'approche vraiment de la perfection. Ma 2e visite et toujours aussi bon!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai goûté que la partie \"chips\" du fish&chips et j'en suis très satisfaite. Pour 3$, on a une généreuse portion de frites maison, larges et tendres, dorées à souhait et bonnes en goût, juste comme je les aime ! 
Tous les produits utilisés ont l'air frais et de qualité. Sinon, beaucoup de poissons différents et de panures différentes (autour de 10$).
Aussi pas mal de place pour s'asseoir et une petite terrasse sur rue."}
{"text":"The place is great. It looks like an authentic fish and chips shoppe. And they even use a chip fork and put paper under the delicacies. Try the maple batter. Be aware, the cod cake appetizer is a little spicy but not bad."}
{"text":"Nice portions, clean restaurant, great service, average fish and great chips. Way too much batter makes for a heavy greasy fried fish experience. Priced right in the heart of town. Try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4, and possibly a 5 if you're only comparing the fish. It's a very casual, and maybe cramped, space. They do some interesting combinations, including a salmon fried in Guiness batter and a hake in Orange Crush, but all three of us ordered the daily special; blue cod in jalapeno batter. I also had a side of baked beans.

The beans were decent, and the fries were pretty good. The fish was the great part. Lightly battered, flavorful fish, filling but not leaving you feeling stuffed. If I had just had a larger order of the fish with nothing else, the meal would have been even better.

We decided to go for broke and order the Fried Whatever; they deep fry whatever candy bars they have lying around, and serve it with ice cream ($1.50 extra) for $5.00. It took awhile, but eventually 2 plates of 3 deep fried Reeses cups each, and one with a deep fried Snickers bar, were set down.

Indulgent? Of course, but I've occasionally tried deep-fried candies (they're disgustingly popular at the New York State Fair) and these were actually pretty good. The batter didn't make you feel sick as you were eating it, as I tend to feel when thinking about just what \"deep-fried\" is. The ice cream wasn't great, but I'm a bit pickier with my ice cream than the average population, and this place is known for their fish, not their desserts."}
{"text":"Nice enough for what it is. The service was slow, but they were apologetic, so we didn't mind too much. The chips were a little overcooked but the fish was very nice and they have some very creative batter/fish combinations to choose from."}
{"text":"It's a real shame they don't deliver. I was referred to Foodora but they treat Cash like a plague. Honestly I don't think any restaurant that doesn't accept cash for delivery should be listed in the delivery section."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner and loved it,  My wife had the Cod and I had the Salmon: both were excellent!  The peas were unique to me (more like smashed peas) but we loved them.  We would go back again."}
{"text":"Bon fish and chips !
Il y a du choix dans les poissons et le résultat est convaincant bien que parfois un peu lourd à la fin du plat !
Ils possèdent aussi une terrasse qui permet de pouvoir profiter du soleil pendant son repas.
En entrée je vous recommande les acras de morue qui sont vraiment bonne."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Best fried fish I have ever had. I had the classic cod. Delicious elevated tartar sauce....lemony mayonnaise with a little mustard. Great mushy peas and baked beans. I am still thinking about this fish and its crispy batter and delicate flesh! You must go here. Got crowded quick on a Friday lunch."}
{"text":"This was our first stop this mtl trip. Fries were crispy. scotch eggs were okay.  Curried fish mayo sauce was good  House beer was very good. service was great."}
{"text":"This place is brilliant! The fish is delicately battered, chips are great, too, and all served over newspaper. Easily the best fish and chips I have had (tried the haddock with maple syrup butter which was delicious)."}
{"text":"Ok let's be real, it's not the real deal but it's as close as your going to get in Montreal. It's a little small and tight but your on McGill street everything is that way. What hits you in the face first is the overwhelming smell of the fryer but what do expect with fish & chips. We tried both cod & haddock and was pleasantly surprised. Nice crisp fish cooked to perfection and the fries were also nicely done. Over all for a quick fix, I would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped at Brit & Chips on a day where I had an extended lunch. I was wandering around downtown trying to decide what to have for lunch and walked by this place. It was across the street from Concordia University's downtown campus so very close to Guy Concordia metro.

I arrived at 10:55am and their door was open. I walked inside and couldn't see anyone on this particular hot/warm spring day. They were making some fries from the looks and smell of it. I went back outside to try to decide whether I should sit outside or inside. I went back inside where I saw a server coming out of the kitchen. I asked her what time they opened and she informed me that they were open right now and had just opened for the day. I also asked them if they accepted credit cards since there was no indication of this and on Yelp (until I had it changed), it showed that they didn't accept credit cards. She informed me that they did (Visa & Mastercard only).

She asked me to have a seat and I sat down. She pointed to the fold-up pamphlet menu which I took a quick look at but had already decided what I wanted to eat. I wanted one of their lunch specials/combos which was basically fish & chips dish with either a 12oz soft drink ($14+tax+tip) or a pint of burgundy lion ale ($18.50+tax+tip). I opted for the one with the ale.

The server that I had was new since she was appeared to be training and shown stuff while I was there. She passed by again and asked me if I knew what I wanted. I told her that I wanted the (lunch) combo with the burgundy lion ale. She then asked me if I wanted something to drink with my meal and I asked \"Doesn't it come with the ale?\". She apologised and we both had a good chuckle. As she was walking away, I asked her if I could pick my fish. She asked me to wait a second so she could get the answer. She returned quickly and said that I could. I asked if I could have the \"Maple Syrup Batter\" and she said it would be fine.

I was the only person in the restaurant so it was very quiet but they had just opened for the day so take it for what you want in terms of speed/service.

My combo arrived relatively fast. The ale and the fish & chips were very filling. I can't say that I tasted any maple syrup in the batter. The fish was quite moist with the outside being crispy. The fries were some of the best fries that I've had. They were fresh cut fries (similar to the style done by places like Belle Province) so thick cut and not like the fries served at fast food places like McDonald's, Harvey's, etc. The ketchup was in individual packs (but about double the size of a standard pack from most fast food restaurants)

While I was eating, the server passed by and asked me if everything was fine with my meal and I mentioned that it was. When I finished my fish & chips and was just finishing my beer, she stopped by again and took my plate and mentioned that I could pay at any time in the front. After finishing my beer, I went to the washroom to wash my hands. The washroom was clean. I had issues with the hand dryer since it was automatic and turned on based on how close your hands got to the sensor but it seemed to need to be very close. Service-wise, it was relatively fast since I wasn't in a rush and left after ~45 minutes so I wouldn't have an issue coming here when I don't have an extended lunch and only have a 1 hour lunch.

Went to the counter after finishing up and paid. It was very good and I would rate the experience to be 4.5 stars which I've rounded up to 5."}
{"text":"Pip pip and cheerio. I had never been to Brit & Chips before but had always heard good things. Don't get me wrong the food was good but it all kind of tastes the same. We had the Haddock in maple syrup batter and Hake in Orange Crush Batter and really couldn't tell them apart. The real flavor came from the dipping sauce. One thing I did really like was that the fish is very lightly battered so you do get a really nice piece of fish with very little fried exterior.  I also tried the he tandoori popcorn shrimp appetizer and that was excellent. Overall if you like fried stuff, this is a great place to try but you might as well just close your eyes and point to a fish on the menu since the flavor profile will be the same regardless of what you pick."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal this past weekend and hit a few restaurants, including a fast food run to Brit & Chips.  Excellent...loved the haddock and cod and the breading on both, and there were plenty of fries and tartar sauce to keep me happy.  And they had a \"half-order\" of local beer for $3.50, which was plenty for a quick lunch before walking around town.  The price was just about perfect for the serving size and the four-person staff was pretty friendly.  I like it!"}
{"text":"Fish: Really quite good! Enjoyed the haddock. Fish light and fresh, batter not too heavy or too sweet.
Chips: Pretty good.
Mushy peas: Not as much of a standout as what I (subsequently) had in England, but still good.

If you're a fish and chips fan, it's a winner."}
{"text":"My previous review was an 3 stars by accident (based on my breakdown it should have been a 4) but forget that now! It's a 5 I say! A FIVE. We stopped in for a bite before heading to BotaBota and it was all because I had a fish & chips craving from earlier in the week that had yet to be satisfied. My poor victim of a guest is NOT a fish and chips person whatsoever and told me as we were waiting that they had literally never had an enjoyable fish and chips meal.

We grabbed a seat on the terrace and took advantage of the $18.50 for a full fish & chips + a pinte. We ordered the Salmon (stout batter) and the Cod (beer batter). The service was relatively quick and efficient in ensuring we were enjoying our meal. OH BOY WERE WE. We split the two dishes so we could taste some of both. The Cod plate was honestly what most higher end restaurants would aim for if they had fish on their menu. Very moist, thicker but light batter, and of course, perfection in the form of potatoes. Every bite was perfect in taste and texture. There was no excess oil, burnt corners or the usual slew of crap in the batter or frozen fish to be seen. This was the real deal. Then to make the meal even better, I had my first bite of the Salmon. The fish itself was perfectly moist, flavorful and wrapped delicately in a thinner layer of a thicker (stout beer) batter. It was too good. Literally, now I'm mad I haven't been going since its farther from home.

Honestly, that Salmon Stout dish... The Keg would be lucky if their chef's could regularly put out a fish and chips dish at that level. And they CERTAINLY wouldn't be doing it for under $14.

In classic British form, the shop's front window gives you a view to the \"kitchen\" (open). You can see for yourself not only how fresh everything is, but how clean and well managed it is. I love that they have seating that overlooks the direction of the kitchen for when you're here solo. I'll definitely be back in the next 10 days to try their \"of the month\" which in September 2017 is JERK. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't quite as personable as the McGill location but food was still spot on. Unlike my last visit, this location had the double-sized ketchup packets that make me grin. Kitchen was spotless and this will still be my best suggestions for anyone in the area needing lunch. Ample seating and super quick delicious food!"}
{"text":"The Resturant is small and clean . The selection of beer was great. The menu is basically anything and everything fried. We started off with the popcorn shrimp which were small but good . The fish chips were good they had different types of batters to choose from. The fried deserts selection was interesting. The Heinz ketchup packs were the double size which was great since they had no bottles on the tablet and everything fried  needs ketchup. The tarter sauce was nothing to write home about . The staff was friendly and helpful. Great place for a fast meal not fancy  plastic knifes and forks place ."}
{"text":"Love this place. I often stay in the area, and this is a \"go to\" place for super tasty food. From what I've tried in the area, this is definitely the best fish and chips. They seem to have mastered a nice crispy exterior, with melt in your mouth fish. Their chips are also amazing and definitely worth of being called British chips!  I recommend the cod, or the maple haddock but you really can't go wrong whatever you order. If that's not enough, their service is also spectacular. Great folk, great food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My goodness how I get cravings for this place!  From what I hear its not authentic fish n chips like you would typically find in Britan, I think its more playful and \"jazzed\" up a bit, example: my favorite dish is the salmon in new castle batter. I dont think thats a typical combo in Britain but boy is it good!. It is rather pricey, About 12 dollars a meal, also its pretty heavy and greasy but definitely worth the extra cash and minutes on the treadmill. 

This place is not good for groups larger than 4, and even that is pushing it. The decor is charming, service is good, and I would highly recommend it for a relaxed date. The burgundy lion beer on tap compliments any dish here very well."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific!  The fish and chips were so good it is as close to British Fish and Chips you are going to get in Canada."}
{"text":"This spot took me back to London-town.
The menu is on a chalkboard as you walk in, they also have paper menu's you can select from.
The fish was crispy, fresh, and greasy (like it should be).  Served with a whole bundle of fries (they were a tad overdone) and wooden spork.
I don't think you can go wrong with any of the fish selections, the hake was tasty and made perfectly.
Sit at the bar area as it's great for people-watching."}
{"text":"This was recommended by locals so we had to try it... ;-)

Being from the UK originally, we were a bit dubious, but actually it was really very good indeed... the fish were both excellent and the batter superb...  the mushy peas were nothing like English ones (actually they were better!). I didn't think the chips were very authentic, but my wife liked them.

Overall, extremely good and definitely a recommend..."}
{"text":"Always find a way to come here on an extended trip to Montreal. You can't go wrong with the fish and chips; was with a professional chef this time who said the kitchen layout is outstanding and fun to watch."}
{"text":"I dont know why I just adore their fish and fries! I usually go and get whatever's on special since I do find it a bit pricey for fried food, but hey it's fish so what do you expect. Good service, relatively fast, I usually take to go though because the decorum is a bit too shabby for my taste."}
{"text":"Having lived in the UK for almost 2 years, I was delighted to discover this little joint! It's quite cozy and they have outside seating during the summer. It's not spacious but well enough themed. The decor doesn't seemed to have changed since I first visited about 3 years ago. I always end up getting fish of the month which is tasty! Just wished that they would dab off the oil a bit after removing it from the fryer.. Or at least changed oils often for frying. Prices are reasonable for the portions. Apart from tandoori shrimps, the accompaniments are disappointing. Always tried fish and chips so can't comment on the pies or anything else. Beers are a fun selection. 
Was always tempted to try the deep fried whatever but the portions are so huge, never ended up having courage to stuff up more with food..  
Overall, it's one of my frequently visited joints for lunch. Reasonably priced, and they offer spc discount too! I have enjoyed everytime I went to Brit and chips."}
{"text":"Having grown up in England this was the closest to chips I've had on this side of the pond.  The fish was good too!!"}
{"text":"Family favourite. Tonight between six of us we had the outstanding maple syrup battered haddock, sour cream and onion battered and the special curry and coconut battered.  I would rate it a five if I could get a healthier side as their salad is perfunctory. Friendly, warm service, good with kids."}
{"text":"Really good! Closest thing I've had to fish and chips from London."}
{"text":"Never had fish & chips where the fish was out fresh waiting for batter. The best I have ever had. I'm only in Montreal for another day or two, and I'm tempted to eat there again before I leave!"}
{"text":"Heureuse découverte, cette place est est digne d'un restaurant de fish & chips qu'on pourrait retrouver en Grande-Bretagne avec en plus une petite tournure québécoise. Les plats principaux sont servis sur des papiers journaux et toutes les marques qu'on retrouve dans le restaurant sont britanniques. Ce restaurant est idéal pour les fans de mushy peas et ceux qui voudraient essayer la batture au sirop d'érable tout en savourant une pinte de bière anglaise !"}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends on our first night in Montreal. We tried two different fish/batter options, fries and a beer and had a great evening! The fish was fried perfectly and absolutely delicious. They played chart-topping hits from the U.K. and provided a casual and friendly vibe after a long drive for us."}
{"text":"This was really good fish & chips. Decent size portion served up by a very nice young lady. Came with a delicious house made tartar sauce. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I ever had! My friend and I went there and she got the salmon fried in Guiness batter and I got the Cod fried in Burgendy Lion beer batter. You get two pieces of fish each so we swapped one of ours so we can both have a taste. Totally awesome! We also got the Tandoori popcorn shrimp which were sooooo good! Went extremely well with a few Guiness! I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Brit & Chips is a right proper chippie that does fish and chips right, serving up one of the best versions of the British classic that I've ever had (including in the British isles).

Aa this was my first visit, I had to go with the classic, having the cod that was dipped and perfectly deep-fried in a Burgundy batter. The cod had a wonderful creamy texture, and the batter made for a crisp, flavorful crunch. Despite being deep-fried, the fish wasn't greasy, and that's a sign that the folks at the fryer know what they're doing. The chips were hot and plentiful, the mushy peas were on-point, and the Burgundy Lion ale was the perfect complement, making for a great, low-key dinner. 

Brit & Chips offers various types of fish, as well as pasties, meat pies, and Irn Bru for Brits longing for a beverage from the other side of The Pond. 

Perfect fish and chips, a great pint, and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours playing in the background... pretty damn great!

BTW, you can check Brit & Chips out on Food Network Canada's site, as they were featured on YGEH! (for 'You Gotta Eat Here!'):  http://tinyurl.com/britandchips"}
{"text":"Rude, dismissive waiter with black freaky beard.
Asked for well done chips, received a salty soggy mess.
Asked for 2 tartar sauces, received one.
Fish is half  the size it used to be.
Expensive for what it is, gross indigestion followed.
Tartar out of a tin, un recognizable from anything I have ever had before.
Waiter was rude, dismissive.
Never again."}
{"text":"I love a good plate of traditional fish and chips! And this place does it right.

For the fish and chips, you can choose between a few different types of fish, and all of them are battered differently. I tried the cod (classic for fish and chips) and it was perfect. You get big pieces of freshly battered and fried fish, served with homemade chips. The chips are small pieces of fried potato- different from normal french fries, and you can definitely tell how fresh they are.

It's pretty cheap (about 10 to 12 per person). They have a selection of bottled French and Canadian beers, and they have one beer on tap. For a very casual, cheap, tasty and deliciously unhealthy food, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chip diners in Montreal! You have the option to choose your kind of fish, batter and sauce. The batter options are unique and flavourful, and the fish fresh and tender. The portions are generous and we never walk away too hungry after a meal here. :)"}
{"text":"Love fish and chips if they are done well and this place has it. Different fish to choose from, fast service and great British takeaway ambiance."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to check this place out for a while, finally did! And I am happy I did. This was my second time trying fish & chips and I was very pleased. Love at first bite, indeed! It's a cute little British spot that offers both take-out service and dine-in service. I tried the cod with burgundy batter which was delicious. Huge portions though. I could not finish the fish or fries. I wouldn't recommend subsisting the chips for poutine, unless you have a big appetite. Service was pretty good and fast. Who doesn't like happy faces! Yay! Another spot - added to the fav list!"}
{"text":"I had supper Tuesday evening at Brit & Chips.

It's a cute spot ... you can eat in or take out.  I ate in.

I ordered the battered haddock.  It was a generous portion (two pieces of fish and lots of fries) ... and delicious!  The batter was light and I could taste hints of maple syrup and pepper.

I had a pint of Burgundy Lion Ale ... it was tasty too.

Virginie was my server and she took good care of me.

If you are in the mood for fish and chips, you should check out Brit & Chips!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! As an American I feel a bit unqualified to make this claim but then again, after growing up with the full range of fried food options, I may be a suitable enough critic. Visiting Montreal for work and needed to order in dinner via Foodora. After a couple previous disappointing dinner deliveries, I was skeptical and decided to keep expectations low, especially for fried fish. Not only did the food arrive very quickly, but the fish was perfectly fried - the funnel cake balance of crispy and fluffy, not overly greasy and not overpowering the flavor of the batter. It was the right balance of sweet and savory all at once. I had the maple syrup batter on haddock and would order it a million times over. Very pleased that I thought to order the \"deep fried whatever\" dessert too - turned out to be some magical creation of fluffy crunchy battered chocolate marshmallow. Happy happy happy!"}
{"text":"Quaint little spot. Excellent choices of fish and chips variations. My broken French was quickly discovered and they switched to English for me. Waitresses efficient and friendly. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"A great go to restaurant when you just don't know what to eat. They won't ever disappoint you with their crunchy fries and fresh fish. The only thing is that the service can be mediocre at time (like when you're out on the deck and the waiter forgets you're there and doesn't come for 40 mins...) but overall the food is great and I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Food is great from time to time i work on mcgillst just too bad that staff is not so friendly but efficient. Put a smile on your face kids"}
{"text":"This our second lunch on day #1 of our visit to Montreal. We really had no business eating another lunch but we were there to bust a gut and decided a highly rated fish n chips joint was too tempting to pass up.

For the fish choices, they had cod, haddock, salmon, hake & sole. We shared the haddock which came with nigh perfect crinkle cut fries. The fish was moist, had a thin crispy batter and tasted great once we added the malt vinegar, lemon or tartar sauce. Slightly disappointing was the portion size of the fish. There was one medium sized fillet and two small ones - not like the large sized fillets you get when you order fish n chips in England... but I'm usually of the mindset that taste triumphs all, so it was all good. 

To wash down the food, I got the Burgundy Lion Ale which is the only beer they had on draft. It was a crisp beer that went well with the dish and the best part was you could get half a pint for $3.50. 

Fish+chips+a pint of beer=$24 all in. Now that's an equation that would make me a happy customer any day of the week, especially when the food is tasty like it was at Brit & Chips."}
{"text":"Waitress tried to tell me that the clearly transparent shrimp was cooked, and that it was bought pre-cooked... 

The fish was good.  I had the cod."}
{"text":"We entered the restaurant and it is a really cozy spot- very clean, white and has a very casual and welcoming vibe to it.  Since it was 23 degrees today in Montreal, we decided to sit outside and enjoy the weather.  Their terrasse is quite small due to their location but it is still a very nice area.  My SO had the Sour Cream & Onion Battered Sole with Chips ($12.50) and since I am pregnant and did not wish to have any beer battered fish, I decided to try their Large Scampi Salad ($13).  I know they have alcohol free options, such as their famous Maple Syrup Battered Haddock, but I wanted to be on the bit healthier side, so I got the salad instead.  I honestly ended up eating a bunch of the fries off of his plate- they taste so good.  If I could have stolen his Fish, I would have done that too.  I took most of my salad home with me.  I am not saying it is bad, but it is not what I was in the mood for I suppose.  

Overall, I don't think I would order the salad again, although it is light and refreshing which is great for the Summer months. I would definitely order some of the Fish and Chips next time we go because they taste AMAZING and I can see why this place is so well known for having Montreal's Best Fish and Chips.  I can't wait to try their other battered options once I am able to- we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"It was like London all over again!!!

The fish was fresh, crispy, greasy, and delicious!

I ordered the cod: which was amazing.

Scotch egg: was okay, I ordered it anyway just because.

the chicken and leek pie was decent as well.

I wish the have a tasting platter so that people like myself, can just order the tasting and eat the whole menu..

Highly recommended when you are in Montreal, QC."}
{"text":"Hi, I'm a Brit. This is not traditional fish & chips - we have our chips fatter and yellower than this, and we don't put maple syrup in our batter - but I don't care, this was amazing.

It's a little heavy on the old \"Rule Britannia\" theming but, eh, I'll let it slide. Maple syrup in fish batter is my new craving."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant dans le vieux port de fish and chips. Je voulais tester une de leur tourtière (chicken pie) ils n'en avaient malheureusement plus!! Donc j'ai pris le fish and chips avec de la sole comme un poisson. Le poisson est délicieux, tendre et fondant en bouche. La friture est bien grasse attention à votre ligne :D je n'ai pas pris les frites mais une salade pour alléger le tout mais j'ai goûté à la frite elle a un goût légèrement sucré en bouche, tendre elles sont très bien. Service courtois et rapide. Petite terrasse avec 5 ou 6 tables dehors pour profiter de la rue mcgill. Dommage qu'ils ne proposent pas de poutine avec ces frites ça ferait un malheur!!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips was amazing - it was crispy and had the right seasoning.  Kudoos to the chefs =D.

The waitress though - hmmm - made my dining experience a bit rough around the edges.   See I would love if our waitress wouldn't give me this \"go away from here\" feeling.   Then I can actually enjoy the yumminess.

So... With that said - dining experience for me comes in two fold (food and service).  If the service is bad, then the food will get stuck on my throat and won't go down."}
{"text":"Tried the maple syrup and the regular fish and chips. They were both delicious! Not too much batter and a good portion of fish. Sat outside on a beautiful day. Inside was a bit warm so we preferred to sit outside. But there were plenty of people eating inside that seemed not to mind. The service was great! Waitress offered up some recommendations and was very polite. Some of the best fish and chips I've had ... If not the best! Must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great authentic chippy spot. 
The batters aren't authentic but ... It will do. 

Was not crowded on a snowy day
We were seated immediately and service was always attentive

We had the maple butter battered haddock and a sausage roll (tres bien!). The burgundy lion ale on tap was delicious.

We will be back to try the pies and the other fish."}
{"text":"Good stuff, nice variety to choose from. I think this is more for takeout than for eating in, but definitely a good place to satisfy a fish-and-chips craving. Try the orange crush batter!"}
{"text":"I had the haddock, nice and juicy,  my wife had the sole, good and flakey. The fries were crispy. I definitely recommend. The popcorn shrimp were a great starter. Ask for the the smoke jalapeno sauce, the spicy mayo, and the siracha to dip. Must have!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves my most preferred comfort food and they do it well. Going there is really a like trip to the UK. The different types of fish'n'chips served there are truly authentic and all taste heavenly. The fries are amazing as well. They also have a whole range of other dishes, such as pies and seafood salads that I'm eager to try. It is one of a delicious experience to go there!! Try it!!"}
{"text":"I ve been wanting to go to this place for a long time. They have a reputation for making one of the best fish & chip and they live up to it. I ordered the burgundy batters, I was not disappointed. You get 2 pieces of fish and you can order chips for extra."}
{"text":"Service rapide et courtois ! Mignon petit restaurant et nourriture délicieuse ! J'ai pris le saumon avec la panure Guinness et c'était vraiment bon ! Mon chum a pris le poisson du mois de la morue bleu panure hawaïenne jambon ananas et c'était tout aussi délicieux ! C'était mon premier Fish n chips et je dois dire que c'était très réussi ! Ce restaurant m'avait été recommandé par un ami a mon chum et je ne suis pas déçue ! Ça vaut le déplacement et les prix sont également très abordable !"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat ok. I thought it would be better for a few reasons. When I got here, I heard there was some hype to this place and it was supposed to be really good. Well, when I got there, I felt disappointed with the fish selection and the fact the staff here are not actually British. They had fried white fish, cod and haddock. I would've like to seen more selections like fried salmon, fried etc and what's the point of having a British chip place if the staff are not British?

It was actually mostly French waiters which killed the theme of the place for me. Oh yes, the food here is really greasy, I had stomach problems after eating here."}
{"text":"Finally got to see what the hype is about! This place is no nonsense deliciousness. No gimmicks, just delicious fish and chips. Tender, flaky and cooked to perfection, it's amazing that you don't feel greasy after inhaling your plate. And let's not forget the fries: perfectly seasoned and crispy, these merit the title of \"chip.\" Plus, the staff are super inviting and friendly. So what more could you ask for? Already excited to go back."}
{"text":"Brit and Chips had long been on my list of places to try so I was very happy to give the downtown location a go one cold December evening.  It's a really casual restaurant that focuses on fish and chips but if that isn't your thing you can always order a pasty instead.  The menu is pretty small but I'm okay with that as long as the quality is there.

They have a few different types of fish and each comes with their own batter.  You can't mix and match batters here.  I ordered the haddock with maple syrup batter.  The fish was very crispy however I couldn't really taste the maple syrup.  Come here hungry because the portions are rather generous.  You get two big pieces of fish and a huge helping of fries.  I was very full by the end of the meal.

That meal and a beer only cost around $18. Given the portion and quality of the food that seemed very reasonable.  I was glad to have finally given Brit and Chips a go because I really enjoyed it and I definitely want to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Decided to grab lunch here before visiting the Saint Joseph's with the girlfriend. This Brit and Chips is found among the variety of cafes  on Côte des Neiges, just up a couple of steps. The restaurant is divided in two main sections: a counter top area with stools for those in a quick-bite-and-go scenario or ordering to go, and a larger room with tables for groups. Overall the place had a pub like ambiance.

We were not looking to stay long so we each ordered a plate of fish n' chips, a Guiness for me and Mystic cider for her. My Guiness battered salmon has a great crisp and was overall enjoyable though nothing out of the ordinary. Her sour cream and onion sole was fun! If they can pull that pair off I am curious to how the orange crush battered fish is like... Satisfying portions for reasonable prices. Can't wait until next time so I can try a pie and some of those interesting appetizers."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Brit & Chips with a bunch of my friends over NYE weekend. We just stumbled upon the place since it was one of the only places open late at night. Holy cow, this place was insanely delicious! Two giant thumbs up. Since we had a large group, we ordered everything on the fish menu. Everything was delicious. However, the sole in the sour cream and onion batter was HANDS DOWN the best choice on the menu. You can not go wrong with the other options, though since all the fish was so fresh, & the batter on the fish had the perfect amount of crispiness. 

Food - A+++++
Service - A+ 
Beer - A+"}
{"text":"Do one thing, do it well - This is what Brit and Chips was born for!

I was here around 5:30 on a Tuesday evening, it's a small joint and it was getting full quickly but they do have a take out counter. Seating is a mix of bar stools and tables. Brit atmosphere is complete with Beatles music in the background.

Nice menu variety, was surprised to see tandoori popcorn shrimps so I wanted to try that immediately and it was delicious. I ordered sour cream and onion batter sole and my friend got the maple syrup haddock - both were very tasty and cooked well, however the batter was thicker on mine. Crispy on the outside, moist inside.
Fries were thick cut, not too soggy. Simple ingredients that turn into savoury satisfaction! If you're still feeling for some greasy goodness, I dare you to try their deep fried dessert ;)

I'm also digging their British Ben Shaws soda, I drank up the \"cloudy lemonade\" which is a perfect balance of sweet and sour that got my taste buds tingling.  I'll be back for more and I'm making sure to tell everyone!"}
{"text":"Love Fish and Chips and these are amazing! I got the Cod my daughter got the Maple  battered haddock. Everything is fried to perfection and the chips are typical English chips, cut short and not super crispy."}
{"text":"Je suis un vrai amateurs de fish n chip, j'ai été très déçu. Il y avait vraiment trop de panure sur le filet de sol. Ambiance fast food. Dison un 5/10, j'ai quand même passer un bon moment"}
{"text":"Yum! We stopped here for a quick dinner and it did not disappoint. I had the haddock with a maple syrup batter, I was a little nervous for this, but couldn't taste any maple syrup. My boyfriend had the cod and I thought his was a little better, but both were very good. The fries - err, I mean chips - were also hot and delicious. I felt a bit sick after, but I guess that's just the price you pay for eating a lot of oily fried food. That being said, I'd still do it again!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I had the popcorn shrimp,could of been better. The batter just slips right off and the shrimp itself was almost raw. I'd give this place another chance but def not for shrimp. Maybe cod or salmon?"}
{"text":"This is my first time having legit (at least I hope this is legit) fish and chips and I wasn't disappointed! The space is a bit crowded but with the summer months coming around there will be outdoor seatings. I wouldn't recommend going with a group of more than four as there is only one table inside that seats four. There are bar seats available as well. I got the sour cream and onion one and it was delicious! Though I wish the flavour was a bit stronger, it was still good. The chips, or fries, were nice a chunky and go well with the fish."}
{"text":"Decent prices. Quick service. Comfort food. Not exactly my food preference, but a good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Un vrai régal, La salle est un peu exiguë et l'odeur de friture présente mais les plats sont bien présentés, et La qualité évidente. J'ai apprécié que le poisson soit issu de la pêche durable. L'accueil à été très bon. Je recommande"}
{"text":"I was served beautiful pieces of moist fish encased in a crispy batter shell. Alongside came tartar sauce and a perfect wedge of lemon to follow every bite. I also took the option of chips (french fries) which were nicely crispy on the outside. Soon enough, I look down on my plate and there was only an oily sheet of newspaper. I didn't realize how fast I was devouring the fish n chips. Definitely the best I've had in my life so far. 

Of course, fish n chips aren't just the only things worth trying out at Brit & Chips. You'd be missing out if you didn't try the imported Ben Shaws soft drink. I don't think that there are many places in Montréal offering these drinks. If you like cream soda then you should absolutely try Ben Shaws' because it just puts any cream soda to shame. 

As for desserts, I had a deep-fried Wunderbar chocolate bar which was somewhat excessive but it was surprisingly good! The melting chocolate and caramel concoction is held together with bits of peanut in the center by which everything is inside a layer of crunchy batter. So good! Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Honestly, you almost wonder why they would have a Brits and fish at that location, bit we decided to give it a try. The least we can say is that we didn't regret it for a second. Nice restaurant, friendly waiters and good food. I took the Salmon with chips and was very please with how fresh it was, large portions and very tasty fries to go with it. Prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Délicieux fish&chips ! Si vous voulez du bon fish&chips, c'est la place ! J'ai pris, le saumon panure Guiness + frites avec une bière Burgundy Lion, frais et très bon. Ils ont une petite terrasse extérieure sur la rue McGill."}
{"text":"The most recent addition to Montreal's recent fish & chips revival is Brit & Chips and they've gone to great lengths to get the details right (from the Irn Bru to the Sarson's), while leaving the door open to play with the formula (one batter features Orange Crush, another features maple syrup, and one of their fish options is salmon). Most importantly, their fish is fresh, it's sustainable (!), and the two varieties I've tried (beer-battered cod and Orange Crush-battered hake) were both exceptionally good. The chips were also tasty, if a little too limp to hold up to the requisite malt vinegar. Other standouts: the tandoori popcorn shrimp could have kicked up the spice a notch, but were juicy and sweet and hard to stop eating; the steak and ale pie had a nice, flaky crust and the braised meat inside was ever so tender. More playfulness: the house dessert at the moment is a deep-fried whatever (i.e., whatever candy bar/sweet treat they have on hand--in our case, a Mr. Big bar). House beer is from The Burgundy Lion. A welcome informal addition to the Old Montreal dining scene."}
{"text":"Went to Brit & chips at around 5pm on Thursday. I walked past it the day before and really wanted to try it out. I wanted to see what it was like compared to the fish and chips from Sydney. 
I was definitely impressed. The cod was fresh and the serving amount for me was just enough. The chips were nice and thick cut. The tartare sauce was delicious, not overly salty. I accompanied the meal with half a pint of ale on top. It was perfect!! 
The waitress was very friendly and hospitable.
Would definitely revisit if I ever get the chance !!"}
{"text":"When I was growing up in the 1970's, Britain probably had the worst reputation on Earth for their food. Rife were the jokes about Brits and how they would boil toast,  and that the only decent thing you could ever eat in London was Fish & Chips.

Well, thank God some things have changed for the better and some things have stayed the same. London is now one of the foodie capitals of the world but the English tradition of great Fish & Chips, with a few small changes and updates,  continues here. I guess it shows what a total opposite of a scenester/ hipster I am since this was my first visit. I've heard tons about this place the past 2 years and I came in with so-so expectations.
There are several versions of Fish & Chips here, differing either in the type of fish or the type of batter they use. I went with the Sole with Sour Cream and Onion batter. It was great and so was the fact that even though everything is deep-fried in oil, nothing came off as greasy or swimming in pools of oil. It was almost light.
I saw a few other interesting items on the menu which i was too full to try but I intend to come back and at least try their Scotch Egg as well as their Deep-Fried anything dessert. Prices are really decent and the service is friendly as well. 

Bonus: If you love Cadbury Flake chocolates like I do and make a point of buying them in bulk everytime you fly through London Heathrow, they serve Cadbury Flake chocolate bar with ice-cream here as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish-n-chips!  The chicken and leek pie was pre-cooked and ready to go for a quick meal - and tasty!  Small place, but lots of character."}
{"text":"This is such a great little gem. The inside transform you into a whole other place and the music they have playing is enough to get you to stay a while and hang. Their menu is simple, fish and chips, so you know they're doing something right. My husband and I had the classic but they do put a twist on their batter, which is a nice touch. The fish came out hot and fresh, and the batter was perfect. My husband had authentic fish and chips in London last year and he said on a scale of 1-10 these were an 8 in his book. Can't get much closer on his scale. They have a great selection of local brews, the cider was my favorite. Decently priced food, great portions and an awesome vibe. Authentic England in the heart of Montreal, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Probably the best fish and chips I've had in Montreal so far! They can literally fry anything it seems and they do a good job presenting customers with hearty portions. The service can get slow at times, but definitely a place to check out in Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Cute and cheerful, this location serves up some awesome fish. We tried the haddock (aiglefin, en francais) and the sole, and both were the equal of anything I've eaten in London.

The greasy chips, on the other hand, were limp and heavy. If an item is in the name of your restaurant, you really need to make said item exceptional. These were anything but. (The mushy peas are delicious, so I'd recommend those as a side dish instead.)

They were out of Burgundy Lion Ale, sadly, but the Bierbrier is a good alternative."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was my point of reference from a recent trip to the East Coast, but Brit & Chips did not live up to the reviews. I was disappointed by the sole with the sour cream and onion batter. The quality of the ingredients from Brit & Chips were questionable. I was overwhelmed by the grease and underwhelmed by the lack of freshness of the fish. The sole was also overcooked. The chips were slightly soft and not as crispy as fries could be.

On a more positive note, the waitress was very hospitable. Both of the wait staff were very friendly and patient with our indecisiveness."}
{"text":"Love this place. Soooooo fresh! And local beers! And very reasonably priced. And super friendly service.

Has outdoor seating, although I think the indoor atmosphere is what really makes this place. Would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I basically write a review for every place I think deserves a 5 stars! Brit & Chips on McGill street is one of them! Went one a Monday night, was the only place that seemed \"alive\" in the area. 

You can sit at the counter in front of the kitchen for the action, on the high chairs  or at the back for a more discrete spot.
 
I committed a sin, took a Fish 'n Chips without Chips but it was to enjoy more the awesomeness of my plate: maple syrup batter Haddock  Delishhh

The waitress was friendly and if I wasn't checking my calories I would be there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Your best bed for fish and chips in Montreal. But you should probably just wait until your next trip to the coast. Oh well. Capable of satisfying a craving. The scotch egg is quite weird."}
{"text":"J'ai été vraiment surprise par Brit & Chips. Ça n'était pas la première fois qu'on me le suggèrerais, mais j'avais une image d'un endroit où on ne sert que de la friture donc c'était un peu plus difficile de me convaincre d'y aller. Pourtant, les belles salades, et les entrées variées m'ont surprises. Il y a des panures différentes selon le type de poissons pour bien complémenter les saveurs de la chaire. Elles sont originales et varient de celle à l'érable, à celle à l'Orange Crush puis une à la Guinness. J'ai aussi goûté aux crevettes popcorn, qui bien que très bonnes, n'ont pas été mes favorites de tout ce qu'on a mangé. Mon coup de coeur a définitivement été le fishcake au curry. J'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner pour m'en prendre un avec une salade pour le lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced, has good service, and great food. (I ordered the cod.) Only wish is that there would be three pieces instead of two, but overall, it's a great place!"}
{"text":"We arrived close to closing time and they were still as friendly as ever. Food was ready in an instant as we were chatted up by the cashier who was very helpful in recommending selections. Wish we had to return during our trip. Their music selection was awesome. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the cod fish 'n' chips and thought that it was solid. Not my favourite compared to the one back home, but still good. 

Good customer service, nice seating, and it wasn't busy when I went around 1pm which was surprising!"}
{"text":"Dropped in while in Montreal for a conference my wife attended! As ex-pat Brits ourselves we found the whole experience absolutely authentic - even right down to the Ben Shaw'a soda pop!! Loved the Haddock in maple syrup batter nut got me the star of the show was the tartare sauce - home made I'm sure!!!! All in all a great Montreal find!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what you would expect when it comes to great fish and chips. I was a little weary because this meal is easily ruined. These folks no how to make a crispy, dark chip and the fish is well battered and fried perfectly - all the batter sticks. We had several types of fish and batters and it was all really good. If you are looking to clog an artery in a fun way, this is your place."}
{"text":"My last meal in Montreal did not rhyme with wooteen sadly, but it did feature a firey fish and chips number from this fine establishment. 

This part of town looks as if it recently came into some money, so it has a more posh exterior than the rest of Montreal, and while it lacks that North American Euro anytown look and feel so pervasive in the rest of the city, I kind of like it. It's clean, well maintained, and pretty quiet.

But, enough about that...onto the food! The fish was fried expertly, with a crisp finish and flaky interior. The chips were fat, plump and greased up just so to give off that perfect glisten. I had the poisson du mois, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. This particular mois featured a sole with jerk batter that gave the fish a wee bit of kick.

I also love the origin story of the place that is on the menu, on the wall, and even on the paper in the basket, below the fish and chips."}
{"text":"So awesome! I'm glad we came here for lunch. Some of the best fish and chips I've ever had. It's nice that they also serve beer here as well. 

Eats:
- salmon which was delishious so soft, fresh and greasy. 
- cod the same as the salmon
- scotch egg was good for my first one ever

Likes:
- service was good
- prices good
- fish was big and they give lots of chips
- they serve beer
- the menu has more than just fish and chips
- location

Dislikes:
- you leave smelling like something fried
- seating for two works well. Anything more than two can be tough

I would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"My friend picked up take-out for the two of us but it was still crispy and fresh about a half hour after later! We got the classic cod and the salmon. Both were wonderful - I don't even know which one I liked more honestly. 
A bit oily, but HUGE portions, and that dipping sauce - YUM
I didn't pay so I'm not sure how much it cost but I will certainly be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Bouffe - Ces gars-là connaissent leur friture ! On vous offre une variété de poisson avec une friture propre à chaque type de poisson. La friture à l'érable est vraiment bonne. Les crevettes cocktails frites sont bien croustillantes et l'uf écossais très intéressant. Un uf cuit dur, enrobé d'une saucisse, le tout frit ! eh eh !

Ambiance - le restaurant fait très bistro de coin de rue avec les tabourets et les comptoirs en tuile carrés de couleur jaune. Un style qui donne un certain charme à la place dois-je dire !"}
{"text":"After having visited at least 50 chippers (95% of them in London) I'm frankly surprised to say this one now belongs to the of the Top5 for me! 

Cod'n'chips was lovely, fish was fine as well as were the chips which in so many other fish & chips places sadly are left as not crispy at all. Pint of Burgundy Lion Ale nicely finished the experience.

I guess it's politically incorrect to say \"in your face Parti Quebecois\" but since I'm a Finn I really don't care: One of the quintessential proper traditional British restaurants is right in your front door, take that!"}
{"text":"I may be the last person to try out Brit &amp; Chips in this city but hey I finally got to it over the weekend, so let me bore you with my experience, okay? 

For the uninitiated, Brit and Chips is exactly what it sounds like - a fish and chips shop. They originally opened up in Old Montreal and have relatively recently opened up a second location in the Cote des Neiges district. They offer a variety of different fish and batter combinations along with other British fare such as scotch eggs, sausage rolls and meat pies. For my first experience, I decided to try one of their more eclectic options - hake in orange crush panure.

Outside of the batter, which was quite amazing might I add, the rest of the dish is very traditional and very well done. The fish is nice and flaky and the batter is thin but very crispy. Add to that some nice fries and a dynamite tartar sauce and you have the makings of a great dish. To add to the experience, they have a variety of different British beers you can enjoy at the same time. 

Unlike most locations of this variety, Brit and Chips also does dessert which I must highlight. They have a deep-fry \"anything\" option which is essentially \"pick your chocolate bar from the options we have and we'll fry it for you\". It comes with or without soft serve ice cream depending in your preference. They had Reese's cups so I couldn't pass this up.

It was exactly as decadent as you can imagine it would be. A perfect end to a very good meal.

With the caveat of having not tried Comptoir 21 yet (in the works....eventually), Brit and Chips is by far the best option in the city for Fish and Chips. If you haven't gone yet, you must certainly do so when you are in the neighborhood.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I ever had, hands down. It's one of my favorite dishes and these guys do it best. Love the beer battered fish and especially the sour cream and onion battered one."}
{"text":"Good stuff here. Decent beer on tap. Fish was nice and crispy with lots of flavor. Good price considering this place is famous."}
{"text":"Greasy but wanted. Fast service, few tables, terrasse available, all collection Beatles music playing all day ;)"}
{"text":"Heard of this place from a bus driver.  We were on a Hop On Hop Off tour of Montreal.  He said that this place makes the best fish & chips in the city.  Well, that's all we needed to hear.  We got off on the next stop, and we walked all the way back to Brit & Chips!!!  

I have to say that Brit & Chips does make some fine fish & chips.  It was the best that we had on our trip, and one of the best that I've had anywhere.  My wife and I already had dinner plans, but we decided to eat here anyways for a late lunch!  ;)

We shared the Cod N' Chips ($12.00).  It was a good sized portion.  Just perfect for the two of us to share.  It was a little greasy, but it was yummy.  Batter was delicious with the fish.

By the way, the ambiance of this little restaurant was very cool.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Restaurant was spotless.

Next time we're in Montreal, I am heading back here for some really yummy food!"}
