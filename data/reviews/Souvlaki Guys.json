{"text":"This place has been open for a couple months. Replaced another Greek takeout place. Exterior and interior have been totally refreshed. Clean and bright inside.

Had the promo 2 Gyros for $10 (cash only for the promo).
Service was friendly and swift.
Meat and fillings were hot and fresh. No fries inside but that's my preference anyway. Pita was pleasantly pillowy and good amount of Tzatziki. Overall gyro size was average but good value for the promo price (regularly $8 each). 

They have family combos and lunch specials.
Will visit again to try other things!"}

{"text":"My wife and I were in a mood for Greek today and this place was really close to us. The place is very small but has a few seating spots inside. It has a patio with metal tables and chairs which right now with the warm weather is great. 

We ordered the Lunch specials: Pork Souvlaki pita with fries for $10 and a Chicken Souvlaki Pita with Greek salad for $12 ($2 more) for the substitution. Service was friendly and efficient. Prices are fair. Stick with the specials to make it cheaper. We both loved the Souvlaki. The Pork and Chicken were cooked perfectly and tasted great. The sides were a bit disappointing. Fries were a bit salty and the feta in the Greek salad seemed off. It seemed more like a powder. 

We'll definitely come back for the dinner as we want more of their Souvlaki and to taste their rice and potatoes. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Best suvlaki i've had in Toronto. I lived in Montreal, NYC, Atlanta, LA and Vancouver and now Toronto... Montreal has hands down the best Suvlaki and this place reminds me of the good places in Montreal. It's killer suvlaki... eat it... EAT IT!"}
