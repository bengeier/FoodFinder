{"text":"Ordered food for my son and I, missing home...Hawaii (Oahu)  Read reviews and thought to try in hopes the food would be Ono (tasty, good)  since the business name really did interest me. Ordered Chicken Katsu, was unrealz Ono, barbecue chicken was just as good!!  So happy I ordered - grinds is a winah"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that Japanese and Hawaiian combined to form the mega crux of beef and chicken. Ordered through Yelp got food in 30-45 mins after order really hot and perfectly sweet, spicy and not to sticky great food. Mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE????

I've been coming here 1-2 a month for 5 years, and it has progressively gotten worse. They don't have half the things on their menu, so if you are looking for something other than the VERY BASIC combination plates, you're better off going to another location. Some of the items they don't have anymore are: pork katsu, pork cutlet, lemon chicken, POTATO SALAD (Aloha A Go Go?!), grilled salmon, KIMCHI, aloha fried rice, manapua, egg roll, any sort of curry, etc.

They also have/HAD a stamp card where 20 stamps would qualify you for a free meal. I went there last week to get my final stamp (which would have made this meal free), and the girl tells me that they are not doing the stamps or honoring the cards anymore because of new management. She tells me the change happened in December. WOW."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Wish they still serve kimchi."}
{"text":"I loved this place, I wanted to take my mom that was here from out of town to try something new, i'm a huge sushi person and she's really not but the combination of a sushi place with a hawaiian place there was more than plenty to choose from, the service was incredible and the prices are amazing for the amount of food you get, she ordered the kalbi rib plate and I got my sushi with an order of chicken musubis on the side so there was plenty to choose from.Also loved the fact that China a Go Go was connected to it so there was chinese food if we wanted to, loved loved loved it will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I this place on yelp and thought I would give it a try. I called to make they were still open and I could still order. When they answer the phone They told me that  they were still open and I could still come in order. When u got to the store they didn't greet me or  knowledge that I was standing at the front counter when I finally asked if I could place an order someone walked over to the front he was incredibly rude he didn't even make eye contact with me. I ordered two different type of sushi I then asked him if he thought the ones that I ordered were good he said they were okay.  I then asked him if he had any recommendations and he said that the   Crunch roll was good which was when I was that I had ordered. He wasn't really paying attention to what I had ordered and he had already written my order down wrong and he just seemed annoyed that that we were even buying food which was kind of strange. Over all the sushi was decent but base in service will not be going back. Disappointed how I was treated."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian bbq here is pretty good, the sushi however is below average, in fact it is borderline horrible. I would go there just for the bbq because there aren't a lot of places around this area to get my Hawaiian fix."}
{"text":"never tried this place because we always go to china a go go next door. i had the grilled mahi mahi and the chicken combo.both very good and comes with alot of food. rice was good and so was the macaroni salad. i was very happy with how good the food was. if you havent tried give it a shot a solid choice!"}
{"text":"I leave nearby and really like their beef platter or seafood platter, the service is okay and they have been pretty fast every time Ive been there."}
{"text":"I the aloha a go go the all sushi and I like the bqq ribs and I like the takeout and pickup delivery"}
{"text":"Not bad for an all you can eat sushi but you need to read the fine print on the menu."}
{"text":"Found this little place when they sent an ad to my house and when i saw they sold sushi and how close they were i had to try it out! I just went there this morning and had a few rolls. For the price, they were great! Definitely filled my sushi craving and i will definitely be coming back for more. The lady there was real nice and the service was quick! I recommend you all try it out."}
{"text":"I go for the spam musubi and I stay for the.... Well I don't stay I usually order to go. Never gave me the runs and I'm still alive so I am pretty sure that means it's good! Havnt tried anything else but definitely recommend filling up on spam!"}
{"text":"Well fuck. I usually rant about asian places.. but this place was on top of their fucking game tonight. Water refills CONSTANTLY. Usually they stingy and shit about their h2o. Not water deprived at all!! Even the sushi was good. They constantly came around asking how we were doing. And the food came out fast. Bathroom was suprisingly clean too. For an east side native I give this place 5 stars fuck all my friends who don't like this place!!! #eastside"}
{"text":"Based on 3 orders. Their mac salad wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't good either. I had pork katsu, it was very over cooked (chewy and inedible towards the end) and the batter/breading wasn't right, much if it just fell off the pork anyway. Boyfriend had chicken cutlet (they used katsu breading for his...) and he said they cross contaminated the oil cause it had a shrimp taste and the gravy was lumpy as well. Other friend had BBQ beef which was fine, but pretty much standard."}
{"text":"I stumbled up this place today during lunch, the Hawaiian BBQ that is.  I am familiar with Hawaiian BBQ because there is one right down the street from my house and I order from there frequently.  Needless to say, I am not happy with my food.  I got the #1 BBQ Mix combo, which is something I always get.  Let me just say, all of the meat, except fir the short ribs are suspect.  I ate as much as I could stomach.  I will not be going back to this location anymore.  Wish I could get my money back!"}
{"text":"Menus were totally confusing---very inconsistent and many items (like dumplings) are left off the printed menus.  Their combos were a bit confusing too--like a mini portion of orange chicken came with rice but not macaroni salad, yet other chicken items came with the macaroni.  I ordered a side of macaroni but after a taste I couldn't eat it--flavorless.  The orange chicken looked beautiful but wasn't that great of quality--big portions--enough for two, but I wish it was more white meat.  The grilled mahi mahi was very salty and their french fries were horrible.  Their burgers were chewy and bland.  Sadly, I won't be back, even though they have a wide variety of items, but I don't think it will be better."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick meal.  The kahlua pork looks disgusting but tastes delicious!  The amount of food you get for the price is very reasonable.  I like the chicken katsu but not the sauce they serve with it so I just use soy sauce and chili sauce, yum.    The only side dish that is almost good is the macaroni salad...they need to cook the pasta longer, always hard, blech.

Man I wish it were open right now, I'm craving that ish!!"}
{"text":"WHERE: Located in the plaza on Charleston & Sloan.

WHEN: 10am-930pm, I believe.

WHY: If you happened to just recently move around this side of town, and are desperately in need of some quick and great tasting Hawaiian food, look no further!

WHAT: I had got off from work and straight home to some hungry brothers of mine! We debated on what type of food to eat, and came to conclude we were all craving some good old Hawaiian food! I would usually drive that 5 minutes to Island Flavor, but the 5 minutes actually became 35 minutes from our new place! Boohooo!!! =(

I then decided to search on Yelp, and I was lucky enough to spot this SPOT. Muahaha!!

First thing's first. We step in to order. My brother and I both get the chicken combo, while my other brother gets the local plate. (Most plates are 8 bucks and well-worth the 8 bucks!!) While we are waiting for our food, the server brings us a bowl of MISO SOUP!!! C'mon, who has ever had a side of miso at a hawaiian joint!! I say BOMB.COM!!! That right there = SOLD! Haha.

After a minute or so, we got our actual combo plates. Fast service, I may add! I loved the chicken katsu, but my bbq chicken was on the bland side.  I could suggest adding a little bit more seasoning or even bbq sauce would have done the trick! Besides my bbq chicken, everything was splendid! I will definitely come back on those chicken katsu crave days!"}
{"text":"I was out running errands and stopped in for a quick lunch. I generally prefer to eat at independent places rather than the corporate chains that dominate this part of town. But as Aloha A Go Go proves, local doesn't always mean better. Looking back, I should have tried Pick Up Stix next door instead.

I opted for the garlic shrimp lunch special, and it came with chow mein, fried rice and a drink for $6. Not a bad deal if the food was good, but alas...  Everything but the shrimp was lukewarm, as though it has been sitting on a steam table for a while. The noodles were lo mein rather than chow mein and were rather greasy and lifeless, the fried rice was overcooked and bland and the veggies under the shrimp were cold. Only the shrimp themselves were hot.

Pretty crappy experience, even for fast food. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I wanted to checkout another Hawaii hole in the wall, and found a decent one in Aloha A Go Go.   I have to admit it's located way out in the right field of Las Vegas, and take some time to get too, but if your craving some Hawaii style plates in the area, it might not be bad thing check them out,   It's pretty well hidden in a Albertson shopping center at the foothill of Sunrise mountain, and has a menu similar to Yummy Sushi.

The place is fairly small, but it has a pretty good take out customer traffic; so getting a table wasn't a problem, but to figure out what to eat was the difficult, because of too many choices.     I ended up with a combo teri beef, and Garlic Chicken.

They took about ten minute to set up the plate, and my teri beef was okay....nothing to write home about, but the Chicken was kind of a stolen recipe of L & L (the ones in Hawaii) garlic chicken...it was good!   but the Mac salad sucked a#s, and they need to work on that big time.

Would I make a special trip to visit them again?  NO, but if I'm near the area, and staving,  I might get the chicken, but without the salad."}
{"text":"Their store sign says \"Hawaiian BBQ\" and not Aloha A GoGo, but it's next door to the China A GoGo, so we figured we found the right place.

Hubby had the Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate and I had the Chicken Combo. We shared the Unagi Roll sushi.

First the good news:  My plate consisted of the chicken katsu and BBQ chicken, which came with a side of katsu sauce, 2 scoops of rice and a side of macaroni salad. Both chicken types were good and I had no complaints, but the rice was on the dry, \"al dente\" side and the macaroni salad left a bit to be desired. I've tasted better macaroni salad before and even L & L serves up better macaroni salad.

The unagi sushi was great! Very smooth and delicious and the avocado inside the sushi was perfect and flavorful! The sushi was filled with crab meat, avocado, and cucumber with eel on top of it, drizzled with eel sauce. Very nice!

Now the bad news:  Hubby was not so fortunate with his choice, which was the Hawaiian BBQ mix plate consisting of BBQ short ribs, BBQ beef, and BBQ chicken. The beef and short ribs were tough and chewy, in spite of the BBQ beef being very thinly sliced. Short ribs are normally tender, but not this one and he said its flavor was mild to almost nothing. The meat was served with a side of sauce, though, so that helped somewhat. Same story as mine for the rice and macaroni salad on his plate.

We thought the best part of the meal was the eel sushi and we'll definitely go back again to try other types of sushi and also their malasadas. I have to say that their sushi is reasonably priced. California Roll is $3.95 and the unagi sushi we ordered was $5.95. Very affordable.

They have a wide assortment of food choices on their menu such as burgers, saimin, musubi, and haupia (coconut pudding dessert) and they offer catering service and delivery service within 3 miles. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Aloha A Go Go used to be known as just serving Hawaiian based food with side sushi rolls. But ever since they've combined their restaurant with China A Go Go and became one establishment, they've added the name Sushi House. So if you order take out, you might be directed to either side when you pick it up. They do delivery as well and are usually on time. Never had a problem with that.

Their main menu looks completely different, as it only looks like they serve sushi, but you can still order all the same Hawaiian food items from before. They've even kept their old menu taped on their window!

They offer All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi for both lunch and dinner. I personally haven't done AYCE here, but I've ordered to go countless of times. I've tried almost all of the sushi on the menu and it always turns out yummy and fresh. Prices seem to be in the same range as other AYCE restaurants as well.

It's not my go-to sushi place, but it's a great joint when you're craving for something quick and you're in the area. Plus it's far from where I live and I wouldn't travel all this way for this restaurant compared to other authentic Japanese sushi houses.

Staff is not very personable when it comes to customer service, which may come off as being unfriendly to some. But it doesn't really bother me since I only get food to go when I'm in the area visiting friends.

It's a great place to try when you're not looking for formality in an eatery and when you just need to feed your tummy with good food. lol

*Since Aloha A Go Go and Sushi House are one establishment, but are known by two different names, I have written the same review for both check-ins*"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is connected to the China A Go Go business that's two store down from it and much like that place, I'm very satisfied with this place. Much like China A Go Go, they cook you fresh food and it's quick. This place has the typical Hawaiian BBQ menu with enters such as macaroni salad, chick katsu, bbq, chicken, mahi mahi, fried shrimp and so on but half of it's menu consist of Japanese dishes. There's about 12 different sushi rolls, tempura a couple of bowl dishes and musubi.Good stuff all the way.

As with any Hawaiian BBQ restaurant, I always judge it by it's chicken katsu and this place is my top spot. I last ordered a katsu/bbq chicken combo and I prefer their version of both compared to the more popular L&L. 

As for the venue itself, it's all clean, less than two years old I think. Last I remember, this place used to be a Sandwich Masters and compared to that place, it's a completely different store. Fairly small, only about 9 tables I think but I've never seen that place busy. Usually people just order and pick up there. You seat yourself there so it's more of the fast food type of deal than a sit down place. 

They seemed to be stressing about not being able to get deliveries out though so either eat there or do a pick up. If you're in the mood for some Hawaiian or Japanese food, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was okay tasting. Will go back to try the malasadas and give a more complete review."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, food is really good. They serve a good portion for your money, I recommend the grilled mahi mahi very tasty!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is rated so low! I happen to like this place! Not as good as Hawaiian Hale, or Ross J's... but it's above average! The lady that works on the register is always sweet and friendly. She remembers me even if I haven't been back for a while! I will continue to go here for their garlic chicken and garlic shrimp whenever I get a craving! Plus, even though they stopped the frequent diners card, i still was able to use my old one that was filled up for a free individual plate!! I love a free meal!"}
{"text":"So I happened upon this place while house sitting for a friend of mine. It was close and I saw online that they had manapua so I had to mosey on down to check them out. The place is small but really clean. The counter had a lot on it but was overall organized. The staff greater me as I came in and told me approximately how long the food would take to cook since I had to go back outside to attend to my dog (who came along for the ride.) So overall I would say the staff was really nice.

On to the important stuff.... The food!!! The Hawaiian BBQ beef that my friend had was really good, but my manapua left a lot to be desired. It dry and lacked the great Hawaiian flavor I was anticipating. If I came back here I would probably stick to one of the BBQ plates. Oh one other thing that kinda annoyed me was they still had skewers on the menu even though they no longer offer them.  So I had to option for a different more costly item to go with my manapua."}
{"text":"This our go to place for ordering if we want something fast, simple, and delicious.  We usually get the Hawaiian bbq chicken plate and my husband gets the bbq chicken sandwich.  Everything is so good.  The chicken is tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  And I must say that I am not a huge fan of macaroni salad but for some reason their macaroni salad is so good.  And also my husband likes their fried rice that comes with the meal."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the hamburger steak I had there.  These people dont understand that the gravy NEEDS to be brown, not white.  What a turn off!  Didn't taste very good at all.  Sushi is good though.  Perhaps they need to actually go to Hawaii and eat a plate lunch before opening a \"Hawaiian\" BBQ!  Auwe!"}
{"text":"Slow service and the boy in pick up has no personality. He needs to watch Barney and learn his please and thank yous!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop into this restaurant today because 1. I just came from the gym and I was pretty hungry and 2. I'm Hawaiian and I'm pretty fond of Hawaiian food.  Checked out the menu and saw that there weren't many options for the vegetarians out there :(  But, it is Hawaiian food (aka rice and meat central) and I knowingly took the risk.  Lucky for me I am a pescetarian so I divulged on the Mahi Burger.  Being used to the Vegas version of the \"L&L\" mahi I was actually expecting something subpar and didn't expect the sandwich to be actually pretty dang good!  The fish was fresh and that's all you can really ask for in a mahimahi burger.  They also let me substitute my fries with kim chee and I must say - the kim chee here is SO good!  I'm not really into the saucy kim chees out there and their kim chee hit the spot.  My fiancee had the \"Local Plate\" which consisted of BBQ beef and chicken, two scoops of rice, a scoop of mac salad AND two musubis for 8.50!  What a deal!  She barely finished it because there was so much food to try and digest.  I did try some her mac salad to compare to the mac salad from back at home but it didn't compare so I passed on eating more of it.

Overall, I thought the food here was actually pretty grubbin'.  Four stars for the lack of veggie stuffs but thumbs up to making a killer mahi sammich.  Would I visit here again?  Pretty sure I will.  Right down the street from my house so why not?  Nice to eat some Hawaiian food other than the L&L and Aloha Kitchen usual I frequent.  More updates soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"My favorites are the Spam Musubi (sp?), Loco Moco, and the Las Vegas Sushi Roll! Great customer service and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Aloha! a go go?  Obviously the sister joint to china a go go ....do Chinese know how to cook Hawaiin?  Anyways....I usually have lunch here once a week or so, I usually have the spam or bbq chicken saimin noodles.  They taste just like the description: spam n noodles.  I have also sampled the lunch special consisting of wayyyyy toooooo much fooood...... like 2 full slabs of chicken katsu, rice, macaroni salad and they toss in one maldagascar or whatever they call it puffy dessert thang....not many choices in the area so I gotta endure it....oh, and the tonkatsu sauce was too watery....til next time, good eating!"}
{"text":"This is a good solid place for a Hawaiian fix. 

I like to get the Atkins plate, it comes with BBQ chicken, short ribs, BBQ beef, and 2 eggs. They also give you a side of rice and Mac salad! It's all very flavorful, and they give you a couple pieces of each meat. This is forsure worth the 8.25. The Mac salad is fantastic, which is another reason I like to get the plate.

If you're feeling extra lazy, they deliver! I haven't used it yet so I'm not sure if they have a minimum. But, how many other Hawaiian places deliver? It's a big plus, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  First we ordered a C&C roll (sushi with crab, avocado, and cream cheese).  It was so fresh and yummy!  It came out very quickly.

My husband ordered the combo that had short ribs, bbq beef, and something else meaty.  The short ribs were a bit fatty, but the bbq beef was really good.  I ordered the chicken combo with bbq chicken and chicken katsu.  Tons of food, and for $7.95? Can't beat it.  Loved the chicken katsu, but the bbq chicken was a bit fatty.  Loved the katsu sauce.  The mac salad was really good!  First time I've ever tasted tuna in a Hawaiian mac salad.  

Overall, really good food.  I wanna come back especially to get some more of that C&C roll!"}
{"text":"Closest Hawaiian food from my place. If I don't feel like driving to L&L. Just as good! But katsu at L&L is better in my opinion"}
{"text":"Come here when I need a sushi fix! Conveniently located in a residential area. We don't have to drive across town and comb for parking. 

It's located in a plaza, right next to China a gogo and Albertsons. 

The staff is really nice. They serve hawaiian food and sushi. The hawaiian food is alright, just as good as L&L. The sushi is decent as well. Not amazing but it's good enough. $4 for and 8 piece California roll and $7 for specialty rolls. 

It's very clean inside and they have comfortable booths."}
{"text":"This place is great when you want to stuff your face after not eating for some elongated period of time. I always order the sampler dish, which has 3 fried seafoods. 

This location isn't nearly as tasty or fresh as the chain's spots in Oahu, where I used to hit up after long days of surfing but still noticed the superior quality as opposed to Vegas locations.

I'd avoid this place after 7 or 8pm, b/c they definitely don't cook the food to-order near closing time."}
{"text":"I love how this place has sushi and also the other common things found in other franchised Hawaiian places. The sushi rolls are good but a tad expensive for each because there is no option for AYCE. But the chicken Katsu is really good :]

If you eat there they give you a little miso soup. Pick up is quick and it's usually never busy.

Being located super close to my house Is a plus.

Overall it's a cool little spot :]"}
{"text":"I'm a good fan of this place. Having eaten here twice, i've tried their sushi and their chicken Katsu. Hawaiian bbq isn't something i eat too often so once in awhile it just tastes great. The menu here has a nice good selection, prices are alright, but the food quality is very satisfying.

Service is fast and the lady working here is very nice. Waiting on orders have been short with my experiences, maybe 5 to 10 minutes on 3 dishes is quite short for the amount they have to cook. I'm not a big fan of Macaroni Salad, but Aloha A Go Go has a pretty tasty macaroni salad. Of course don't expect anything fancy here. 

The chicken katsu is also quite good. comes out fresh tasting, and crunchy and at the right temperature it's just perfect.
Not much else to say but definitely give it a try. I've tried many other Hawaiian bbq's in Las Vegas and Aloha A Go Go doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"They recently did a complete remodel of the restaurant. It now has a swanky sushi house appeal that is actually pretty well done. There is nothing left that remotely conveys any aloha spirit. With that said the menu is still the same but prices went up about a buck. They now have a wait staff that was prompt and efficient albeit any emotion. There is no music playing anywhere and it gives the ambience a very odd vibe. Sort of feels like going to your buddies house for dinner only to find out that daddy is sleeping with the lady next door and a divorce is right around the corner. The food was pretty decent still. I had the grilled mahi and they served with 3 solid pieces of fish, 2 scoop rice and 1 scoop Mac salad. I think they changed the recipe of Mac salad or they just get it from Albertsons next door. It used to be bomb, ono, or even \"broke the mouth\" if you will. It basically now just plays the part. They do offer AYCE sushi now which is kinda cool. The table next to me had plate after plate coming out so that's good. Food was good and all but when I want Hawaiian I want aloha spirit. I'd probably just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yes, there's L&L and Aloha Kitchen on the Eastside, but my favorite spot is Aloha a Go Go for Hawaiian food.  

Its a small restaurant with about 6 tables.  I usually order food for pick up and they're very fast and efficient with getting orders out because I've never had to wait for the food to be done.  

I always order chicken katsu and I like how all their food isn't overly greasy as it is at other restaurants.  You can order your meals either mini (1 scoop of rice and mac salad) or regular (2 scoops of rice and mac salad).  They also have sushi rolls available!  My go to rolls are the Las Vegas and Lisa roll.  And you can get a side of kimchi for $1."}
{"text":"Dad back home from hospital after several months after a heart attack, heart surgery, pt.

So for Thanksgiving, we decide to order food out so that my mom will not have to cook anything since she has been very busy since my dad came home just several days before.  The goal was to find something a group of people can enjoy.  Since we are Pilipinos, we don't adhere to the Turkey thanksgiving adage so anything good is fine.  My sister and her family are visiting from Pittsburgh so we discuss what should we eat.

Joji - well what should we order, check out chinese, costco, trader joes, smiths anywhere

Melanio - well we have to know what is open

Kuya, well how about Don Antonios, they have pasta (this is bec I mentioned Brian my partner will not be eating meat like everyone else who will eat anything

Melanio - I will look up.  Great menu, not open on Thnksgiving Day, their suggestion is to buy it Wed and heat it up Thurs.  Nope

Melanio - well there is Salt Lick BBQ here in Red Rock.

Joji - Mama doesn't like the BBQ at Green Valley Resort (Red Rock sister resort), How about Aloha A Go Go, they have been there before.

Melanio - Ok.  I will order something from Salt Lick and you order the rest from Aloha A Go Go

Okay I would say some more but you get the gist, I will get several more calls about the menu at Aloha A Go Go, price, half tray, full tray, beef, pork, chicken,shrimp etc.

So what do we get, half tray bbq chicken, fried shrimp and they will throw us some fried dough with cinnamon sugar for free!

Well here comes the relevant part.  Hawaiian bbq chicken - comes flat looking like pork on top of vegetables.

Joji - they have broccoli under the chicken, do we serve that?
Melanio - probably just for catching the grease from the chicken like in chinese and thai restaurants.
Joji - food is still hot, put it in the oven to remain warm until guests arrive to eat.
Melanio - ok, everybody is gtting hungry who is here
Andy (my brother in law) - started on the chips from Salt Lick (everyone eats it too)

Aloha A Go Go food - bbq sauce for chicken, okay not great (soy sauce and sugar?), fried shrimp - too much breading sauce tartar sauce

Both dishes are flat for some reason (as in thin pieces).  Imagine your bbq chicken and fried shrimp being served after the car has run over it several times to flatten it.  I didn't expect the food to be flat but tried it anyway.  Only okay. wouldn't recommend it to a funeral party.

If you like to make sure that your food is sandwich ready, get Aloha A Go Go to go.

P.S.  the vegetables (not broccoli only) under the chicken was meant to be served with the chicken...aya yay yay!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here for a Hawaiian food hunt but got AYCE sushi once we saw it on the menu. It's pretty cool they let you order half rolls to be able to try a little of everything. Sushi was fresh and thick which is always good. Will come back again for the chicken Katsu"}
{"text":"Had the Loco Moco last night.  It sure took care of my cravings.  It's conveniently by my house and I will be sure to come back for more."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy... Really good Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"Very attentive staff, not what you expect out of an asian establishment. Food was very good..katsu sauce not the run of the mill fruit sauce they give you at L&L or ohana bbq. More of ikari or bulldog sauce. Plus if you want some chinese or japanese or vice versa..u can order whatever you want..another plus is the AYCE sushi"}
{"text":"Ah, the plate lunch. Carbs, grease and salt. Those are three of the four major food groups, if memory serves me correctly.

Aloha A Go Go is pretty typical of these places, but their just-barely-creamy macaroni salad is some of the best I've had.

My usual order is a combination of garlic chicken, which is stir-fried with piles of minced garlic, and the volcano chicken, which is basically spicy BBQ chicken. Both start off decent, but the rubbery dark meat chicken can be a little hard to stomach after a while. Scarf down some rice and you'll feel better. I don't recommend the soggy, flavorless kalua pork.

Service is friendly and accommodating. Portions are massive.

Otherwise, the place is unremarkable, perfectly acceptable but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"I tried their food once...terrible!  I love their chinese food from China A gogo, so figured this might be decent...not even close to my other regular haunts such as Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and Aloha Island grill on MD Pkwy and the one on Sahara."}
{"text":"The foods good . Bad customer service . The owner said cash only for delivery. Was very rude."}
