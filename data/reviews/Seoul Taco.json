{"text":"Interesting flavor combos. Solid prices. Will definitely come back. I got the bulgogi beef bowl and it was great!"}
{"text":"Unorganized mess. Don't believe the hype. My friends burrito had literally three small pieces of pork and my salad bowl was basic and flavorless. It wasn't cheap either. Oh and i finished my meal before my friend even got his meal which is mainly the reason for the first word of this review."}
{"text":"Seoul Taco is very unique.  The concept for the restaurant came from a food truck show on Food Network that features a blend of American Mexican with Korean flare.  The Seoul sauce is wonderful and gives a little heat to go along with the spicy pork burritos or tacos.  The gogi bowl is a different take on most burrito bowls featuring rice, eggs, green onions, meat, and kimchi.  The product is consistent but the interior comes off dirty and the music is too loud for conversations."}
{"text":"The restaurant overall was pretty cool! I love all of the puns and decorations, but the kitchen still looks like it is under construction. I ordered two bulgogi tacos and kimchi fried rice. The tacos were AMAZING, especially with the spicy mayo sauce on top, but the fried rice was really bad... It was really sweet and dried out. The staff was super friendly, and the prices were as expected."}
{"text":"Wow.. Never thought I'd see a Korean fusion joint that had REALLY tasty food & a friendly staff where NO ONE was Korean. The Kimchi fried rice in the burritos are ingenious."}
{"text":"TL;DR: It's not bad; it's fine, but it isn't great. Definitely my definition of \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"

The Good:
- The Pork in the Spicy Pork Burrito is very good, but unfortunately, there just isn't enough.
- I really like the use of spring green mix instead of traditional cabbage or lettuce in the burrito.

The Meh:
- The kimchi rice is just okay. The problem is that it doesn't really pack the flavor punch you would expect from kimchi, which is more of a problem because the kimchi rice is at least 60% of the burrito.
- It's kind expensive for what it is. The ingredient are pretty high quality, but there was too much rice in the burrito for the price."}
{"text":"This place is fire! I was there this weekend. Big fan of the STL location. Some of the best fusion I've had. Cant get enough of the spicy pork tacos!"}
{"text":"So they still have some kinks to work through. (The iced tea machine still wasn't working) Nevertheless my meal was amazing. The menu is very small. So it makes it easy to choose from. I ordered one bulgogi and one spicy pork taco and a side of kimchi slaw. They were fantastic! And well priced. I'm excited to see how this place comes together."}
{"text":"Seoul Taco is my immediate stop if I'm looking for quick and awesome quality food! I usually go to their Delmar location, but was in town visiting family and had to make a stop at the Champaign store. Just as superb! I would highly recommend getting any of their burritos and adding an egg in it. If you're looking for a taste of Korean flavor plus a little Mexican, I would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Is it the best Korean food I've had? No. But this place is good if your having a kimchi or bulgogi craving and need it fast. I got the bulgogi burrito and an order of kimchi rice (which was way too much food). The flavors were great. My only complaint would be that the rice was overcooked and a tad gummy. If they improved their rice texture I'd go back for sure. However, the burrito was good, the kimchi was really spicy, and the flavors were good so overall, not too shabby."}
{"text":"I went there with my daughter. I had only ever had fusion tacos in Seattle. I thought these were very good. I would skip the Kimchee rice as it as almost flavorless."}
{"text":"Are you craving Korean or Mexican food? If the answer is yes, Seoul taco it is.

The menu is simple. I ordered the bulgogi quesadilla and a spicy pork taco. The taco was delicious, a good mix of meat and lettuce. The quesadilla was very meh. The quesadilla was not held together by the cheese, quite unusual. There was a thin layer of cheese with meat and lettuce on top. Quesadilla fell apart very easily and was super messy to eat.

Side note: when I was paying, the cashier coughed into his hands and handled my credit card. I'm not a germsphobe, but please teach your employees how to cough into their sleeves. (3 stars for this reason)

Overall I think the tacos are good, but not sure about other items."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. I love spoon house, so thought I would like this place too. I had the beef burrito. The flavors and spice were good, but there was more fillers in my burrito than meat. Way too much rice.  Maybe I will give it awhile before I go back."}
{"text":"The music is so loud in this place that it honestly ruins the whole atmosphere. The cashier could barely hear me to take my order. I was also planning to sit down and eat with my friends but that was a no go because we couldn't even talk to each other over the loud music. 

Food was okay, kind of expensive for the amount. 

Seoul Taco, please turn down your music!! It's a restaurant, not a bar."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Korean BBQ restaurants, and I'm not sure how this translates into my knowledge of good Korean cuisine, but I definitely am familiar with most of the flavors/ingredients incorporated into the menu. 

The place recently just opened, so I didn't expect anything spectacular in terms of decor upon entering. It was very clean, with simple decorations. 

I ordered the burrito with the bulgogi beef. It was good, but I was not impressed. The flavor combination was a bit bland and thus, I ended up loading the burrito with sriracha as I ate it. 

Overall, a nice place to try out if you want something new, but not quite a place I would add to my regular line-up of fast casual restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Tacos are the real deal here... Both beef and chicken choices are delicious. Burritos are ok. Kimchi fried rice is super bland. Thanks there's Sriracha on the table. The service is fast and on point and the staff here are friendly. The place is super clean. However the price is a bit steep compared to others in campus area but understandable due to its novelty."}
{"text":"This place could be much better if they didn't always run out of ingredients and have extremely slow service. The food is pretty good but it's not worth it when you have to stand in line for 20-30mins.  Also, every time I have been here they have run out of at least one main ingredient.  If they fixed these two problems I think Seoul Taco would be worthy of more stars because the food is really good."}
{"text":"So I went back and it's definitely improved.  Comparing it to a similarly priced modern/fusion burrito/taco place (like Chipotle), I would definitely say the the flavors pack more of a punch and they're all definitely more distinct.  I'm still not to the point of \"Yay, I'm a fan,\" as the 4-star rating would suggest, but I definitely think that it's strong competitor on campus.

As for the change in opinion, the Gogi bowl had a better proportioning of ingredients and the taco had more meat (always a good thing!).  I was still disappointed that I was given a plastic to-go box even after being asked if I was getting it \"for here or to-go.\"  I know that they have and could clearly see the wooden bowls used for eating in sitting in the kitchen.

The kitchen is still half empty and the customer service is... complacent at best.  They should've taken over the restaurant labeled as \"Pitaya\" on Green street for a better aesthetic and flow.  I have a feeling they'll never hit over 60% capacity unless something big changes.

I really wish I could give them 3.5 stars, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt due to my (as my friends say) \"scathing\" review the first time."}
{"text":"Great customer service. We were there Friday of last week around 7 and our cashier was great. The food was awesome too. The nachos were yummy! You have an excellent team."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, but the food was not OK.
I ordered a Gogi Bowl with steak bulgogi.
The meat was too sweet, and the sauce was again too sweet.
The veggies were just lettuces and carrots, a hint of green onion.
Overall, the dish was too sweet without enough veggies.
It was like a rice bowl with a lot of sugar.

With $8, you can go get a better bowl in any other Korean restaurants.
It's definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"I came in during their grand opening and it seemed like it was decently busy. I got two tacos, one chicken and one pork and while they were much better than Spoon House's the overall experience was just ok. It was nothing particularly special. Granted. they'll probably get much better as they get into the swing of things. 

Quality: 4/5
The meat was good quality and the ingredients looked pretty fresh. Also the presentation was pretty. :) That being said, stay away from the chicken, it's watery so it makes the tortilla break down and you end up with a mess on your hands. 

Value: 2.5/5
Kind of expensive, but then again so are most Korean fusion places. I think the tacos are worth it, but the bowl and burritos really aren't cause you're paying a ton for basically rice+some other stuff.

Ambiance: 2/5
I think this is their weakest point. Maybe they don't really want to be a sit down place but the inside looked kind of dingy and dusty. Their decorations looked pretty shabby as well. I'd recommend just getting something to go and then just going across the street to Latea or something and eating there.

Service: 4/5
The staff was friendly and service was fast. Someone even came over to see how our meal was.

Taste: 3.5/5
It tasted alright; there was too much rice for my liking and it seemed like some orders were too covered in lettuce."}
{"text":"Love Mexican and Korean fushion and this is a perfect gen to find! Never been to champaign before and this was across my hotel... the scents inside of the Korean BBQ was tremendous!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! It used to be that just Spoon House was the only place to get Korean Mexican fusion food. The restaurant is clean with good seating. The food comes out fast and they are very generous about the extra sauce. The decor is cute, Godzilla mural and all. Simple menu makes it easy to order but has enough variety to be excellent. Medium sized portions so don't expect to take home extras unless you get the burrito!"}
{"text":"Came to champaign for a day trip and stopped by this place for a quick snack. Their wasn't a lot on the menu, but I just really wanted tacos.

I ordered 2 tacos, the beef and spicy pork taco with no onions. My friend ordered the burrito and kimchi fried rice. The food came out pretty fast and looked good. I will have to say that the spicy port taco was better than the beef taco. The kimchi fried rich was good, but where was the kimchi? The burrito is basically a beef taco with kimchi fried rice wrapped in tortilla. 

I would come back next time for a quick snack and will definitely try the Gogi Bowl."}
{"text":"Gogi, or \"bulgogi\" thinly sliced, marinated steak taco with Spring lettuce mix and lime juice was delicious! I asked for the sauce on the side because it is too spicy for me but otherwise delicious and very reasonably priced (about $2.50 for one). I would definitely return and try other menu items."}
{"text":"I'd recommend only going to this place if you have that offer on hooked for 1 buck per taco. The taxis otherwise are over priced and not worth that much money as the meat content is quite less and there is more vegetable stuffing than that. As I had only tried the tacos, I can't give a complete review but I'd rate it as average."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, my friends and I are here almost once a week. Get the spicy pork on anything! The beef is good and the chicken is meh. Though sometimes they are understaffed, most of the time they have fast and super friendly service."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased with my meal at the new Seoul taco.  The  spicy pork and chicken tacos were delicious and had lots of flavor.  I look forward to returning and trying all the other items on the menu.  A definite hit here in campustown"}
{"text":"Best food in Champaign-Urbana area! If you like Chipotle, you will absolutely love this place! I've had the spicy pork, chicken and steak on a burrito, tacos and nachos, and they've all been awesome.
My favorite would probably have to be the spicy pork burrito if I were to recommend something for your first visit. But you can't really go wrong because all the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried out Seoul Taco today as a late lunch. It was my suggestion as I've tried different Korean restaurants and the idea of Korean/Mexican fusion sounded more than amazing; nirvana could be the word. Either way I could go for some Golgi beef. I wound up having the Golgi bowl with fresh spring lettuce, white rice, Korean bulgogi beef with a paste sauce that had Korean spices, smoky barbecue aromas and a slight spicy kick. My parents loved their tacos and we all agreed that the meet; tenderness and flavor was incredibly delicious. Though they weren't too crazy over the fried rice, which had sort of a softer consistency and wasn't as flavorful as the main dishes. I enjoyed my experience and the fresh ingredients that were used in my bowl. The service was great and attentive; the lady behind the counter even brought our food to us. It was also very clean and not crowded, double plus- we know how our city can get. Overall Seoul Taco is unique and stands out with their versatility and the zest of flavors in the meat, as well as the blinding of two major area cuisines; I believe with a more expansive menu this business could skyrocket even bigger. Korean Guac anyone??"}
{"text":"I used to like their food a lot. It is fair price with more vegetables than other eat out places. But today I went and had a quite unpleasant experience. There were only two staffs and the girl who prepared my food later took the order from the guy after me. He used cash to pay and she processed the bills and changes with her gloves on. I didn't see her change gloves or wash her hands after. And she went to prepare my food which she touched quite often with her hands. The process didn't seem very hygienic. I hope I was wrong that she changed the gloves somewhere that I didn't see. But it is hard to believe that she will change the gloves every time  after she processes bills. Hope something can be done about it. Food is not bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in after trying a restaurant that did not by any means satisfy me. I grabbed 2 tacos, both chicken. Appearance, not bad looks like a taco. Taste, amazing!! Would recommend the tacos, price seemed reasonable considering meat portions on the tacos and quality of ingredients. Decor is very unique, I love the stereo \"wall\" to the west of the counter where you order. Will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Used to be good, but tonight I went during dinner hours and it took the two guys who were working there over 15 minutes to take my order, and make me two tacos. The tacos tasted alright but the meat was overcooked and the taco was a bit stale. One taco had a decent amount of meat, the other had about a tablespoon. I don't know what was going on but it seems strange to have so few employees during dinner rush. One seemed to be the prep cook, and the other was the front register and guy-who-makes-food-for-customers. I used to like this place but it has gone a bit downhill I think."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and found this location on Yelp, it sounded amazing. I arrived around 5:30 on a Monday evening to find the doors locked. I peeked inside and it looked as if nobody had been there all day. I was very disappointed. One star for a clever name. Hopefully someone will put it to good use."}
{"text":"Great tasting food if they have it. Starting the spring 2017 semester, the management has been poor. There has been multiple cases when only one person is working which slows down how fast our food comes out to about half an hour sometimes longer. They are always out of food such as their kimchi fried rice and they only offer white/brown rice as substitute which greatly lowers the quality of their food. This occurred the past three times I went there."}
{"text":"amazing food, super cheap. Very healthy too! Just make sure ask for extra lettuce for those on point tacos"}
{"text":"The tacos tasted pretty good, but they did some damage in return....if you know what I mean....    I'm adventurous and I might have to try it again. At least the restaurant has a cool vibe and the people working there were nice."}
{"text":"Had the bulgogi steak taco. was fully anticipating being let down but was pleasantly surprised. very fresh, well done taco. what I've gathered from other reviews is that the burrito is over priced and the tacos are reliably  good without being too expensive. 

will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, delicious food.  I would eat here all the time if I lived here.  The meat on my taco was crispy, sizzling,  and flavorful.  Tortillas soft and fresh, they didn't break apart.   They are just the right size and aren't gargantuan.  I go for quality over quantity any day and this place scores high on the quality scale.   I wish we had a place like this where I live! Keep up the good work, Seoul Taco!"}
{"text":"This is a small little fast food restaurant in Champaign, just around the corner from the infamous Green Street near University of Illinois.  This is a rather bright and cheery, and trendy spot.  Upon entering, your ears are greeted with loud, energetic music.  There is interesting Korean artwork on the walls, and another wall is lined with a stair case adorned with bright neon boom boxes.

Again, this is a fast food, so you review the posted menu and order from the counter.  Being my first visit, I asked more details about the menu.  The clerk was fully knowledgeable of the menu and sauces.  But, I decided to keep my order quite simple.  The steak tacos were quite tasty.  Tender meat, garnished with Korean green salad mix, onion, with sweet Seoul signature sauce, wrapped in a corn tortilla.  To top it off, you are provided a small lime wedge to squeeze over your taco for a splash of additional flavor.

Unfortunately, like a lot of others have commented, the serving portions are quite small for the price.  After my initial purchase of 2 tacos, I purchased 2 more tacos, which totals 4 tacos, and I was still hungry!  Sad Face......."}
{"text":"I just had what was possibly the most interesting burrito of my life (so far, anyway). Kimchi fried rice, tofu, carrots, lettuce, cheese, and Seoul sauce perfectly wrapped in a soft tortilla. Spicy, mouthwatering, deliciousness. The menu is limited so this is not a place I'll visit too frequently, but it's a big change from my normal culinary repertoire and an excellent choice for a quick bite - certainly more interesting than many a meal I've had in CU. Service was friendly and quick, and my burrito was well worth the $8 it cost. At nine months pregnant, I could hardly finish it (but I managed)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant by a long shot!  Whenever I am in Champaign or Columbia I make a stop. Everything on the menu is terrific! I can't my even pick a favorite.  Service is friendly and fast. Ingredients are always fresh and delicious. This place will make you forget Qdoba and Chipotle exist!"}
{"text":"I might only be half Korean but this place legit. This takes Korean fusion to the next level. This is the kind of foods you would only find in LA's Korea Town. If you are looking for \"authentic\" this is totally not your place there are plenty of places in town for that, but I don't say that in a bad way. This place brings a good Mix of Korean food with easy to consume methods of Tacos! The Bulgogi meat they use is legit. The \"Gogi Bowl\" is legit. Kimchi Fried rice is great too! The atmosphere is the coolest Korean restaurant in town. It's totally aimed for the college crowd and the murals on the walls are awesome. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Seoul Taco has so much flavor, but not the biggest portions. Despite the size of the burrito, it was still super satisfying. On the contrary, the tacos were quite skimpy. Size was overcome by the phenomenal flavors, which was a very satisfying dinner!"}
{"text":"Never had anything quite like this. It was a little more spicy than I would have expected or like, but over all it was an experience worth trying. I think I will return to try the burrito as I tried the tacos last time."}
{"text":"I hadn't really tried Korean-Mex fusion before, so I don't have much to go off of, but I felt that the flavors from Seoul Taco weren't really nuanced. I had the chicken burrito. The rice was kinda bland, and it felt like there wasn't much variety in flavor--the entire burrito kind of tasted the same, except for the small parts in the burrito that had Seoul sauce. Had their been more sauce, it would've definitely been better. Most of the burrito was rice, and it wasn't really easy to eat unless you included it with a bite of some other ingredients in the burrito.

I'll be back, but only to try the quesadillas or tacos."}
{"text":"I've had the gogi steak bowl twice now and it was delicious both times and a cute set up inside. Definitely one of my favorite places on campus."}
{"text":"Decent Korean fusion restaurant but a tad overpriced. I tried their burrito, which was around $8, but the sauce was too overpowering in my opinion. At least this place is open until 2am on weekends, so it makes for some solid late-night food."}
{"text":"Burrito and Tacos are all beautiful. Perfect match for a Korean-Mexican fusion. Hooked app deals also help so much."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed when I got a huge bowl but with a small portion of cold fried rice Gogi bowl. The fried egg and bulgogi steak were nicely cooked and well-flavored. But the kinda cold kimchi fried rice (the base!) and little amount of carrots and lettuce just don't add up. Am I eating Korean food (bibimbap)? Or Mexican food since the place is called Seoul Taco.
Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. I asked for 3 chicken tacos, did not get 3. My boyfriend ordered 4 tacos and got all of his. They were spicy too. I like spice, but I wish they would of asked if I wanted spicy or not. I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I understand that this is \"Korean fusion\" otherwise known as, \"dumbed down taste and little option for vegetarians and vegans\" but it still managed to disappoint me. I don't remember what I tried as far as the tacos go, but I tried their \"bibimbap,\" and it was shameful, just a disgrace. This place makes me sad, as does their rendition of kimchi."}
{"text":"It was ok. Especially for the price it wasn't blowing me away. Being that I'm not a big kimchi fan it was frustrating when I ordered no kimchi to have it on there anyway. The taco I tried was pretty good, though the meat didn't have a ton of flavor. Overall it's a \"C\". If you like the kimchi it's probably a \"B\"."}
{"text":"They were out of eggs, carrots, green onions, steak, and pork when I came. Only two people were working as well, both clearly frustrated so the service was poor. The food itself was also mediocre- my meat had a piece of bone in it. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I heard Seoul Taco recently opened on/near campus so the girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot for dinner on a Thursday. 

The inside of the place is simple, but nicely decorated and very clean. 

The menu is also very straightforward. It's basically Mexican-style foods like burritos, tacos, quesadillas and bowls, but made with Korean BBQ/Asian ingredients. 

I opted for a spicy pork bowl, and she got the chicken quesadilla. 

My bowl was very good. It was a mix of rice, spring mix lettuce, carrots, pork, a special spicy sauce and a fried egg on top. Everything blended together quite well, and honestly the fried egg is probably what made the dish. The pork seemed to be of good quality and had a great BBQ flavor to it.

I tried her quesadilla and that was also quite good. It had a particularly tasty sauce on top that I couldn't figure out, but it was delicious.

My bowl was $8 and her quesadilla was almost the same. The portion of the bowl was good, though I'm not sure quite as large as Chipotle's burrito bowl. Still, for $8/person, we had a unique, tasty dinner and we were both pretty happy. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the music taste is awful - I hear it constantly in early morning hours and its just annoying to hear. Please stop playing music so loudly and respect Champaign as a community, not just for your presence."}
{"text":"They must get a handle on the service side of things. I've been here 10 times and consistently have too few people working. Two people is not enough. The food is good however. When I see a line though, I keep moving."}
{"text":"First they messed up my order. The I Waited for 30 minutes, never got my food. Staff was extremely nonchalant. Didn't seem to care about it and was extremely rude."}
{"text":"I am a big Seoul Taco fan back home in STL. I'd previously checked out the Chicago location (rock solid) and in CoMo (college town - did the namesake proud), so while in Champaign I gave this location a whirl. What a disappointment.

I stuck with my tried and true bulgogi steak burrito with kimchi slaw. It lacked its usual killer taste (burrito). The meat was dried or over cooked, and it tasted like a lack of Seoul sauce on it.

I don't know if it was a bad day, shift change, new cooks, etc. But my visit lacked the same Seoul Satisfaction I'm accustomed to with these restaurants. 

Be fresh, stay fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to try new cuisines, so we decided to have our late lunch here and experience the Korean-Mexican synthesis. I had the bulgogi steak tacos, and my husband had the bulgogi steak burrito. The bulgogi steak was surprisingly delicious paired with sriracha sauce and fresh ingredients to boot! Overall, we would patronize Seoul Taco again!!"}
{"text":"I got the bulgogi steak taco!
At first I ordered just one taco, just to try it.
I received two tacos for $2.50 and they were really good! Better than maize and sooo much better for chipotle.

I ended up leaving with 3 more orders of tacos and got one order for free with a buy-one-get-one deal from the App \"hooked\", which the cashier told me about.

The atmosphere had a chill vibe. Decoration was varied: a big mural on one wall, a shelf with neon, old radios, etc.

Would recommend for a quick, cheap, delicious m

Looking forward to going again!


UPDATE: I order a taco for $2.50 but they gave me two for $2.50. The tacos are 1 for $2.50!"}
{"text":"Service was awful due to severe understaffing, and the tables looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while. I got a beef bulgogi burrito, which was advertised to come with kimchi fried rice, beef, and \"Seoul sauces\". While the meat itself tasted fine, everything else was lackluster and/or felt like it didn't belong there. The \"kimchi fried rice\" was just soggy rice with kimchi flavor, and the sauces seemed to be a combination of spicy mayo and some type of wasabi sauce, neither of which are really Korean nor Mexican. There was a piece of bone in both me and my friend's food too. They also ran out of beef (among other things) after half of my party ordered, so the other half of my group left and got Chipotle instead. 

I'm not sure if the place was just having a bad day due to unexpected understaffing, but it certainly wasn't a good experience for us. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I like it. I *really* wish they had some kind of a sweet sauce. And I think that everything is quite overpriced EXCEPT their gogi bowls. But I find myself going in for gogi bowls fairly often. They're good. I like the steak.

Would recommend adding seoul sauce to the gogi bowl. It adds something extra. I just think it's really missing a sweet sesame sauce or something like that."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear about Seoul Taco when it first opened because the concept of a fusion of Korean and Mexican food sounds amazing.

First, the restaurant is really cool and has a nice vibe. The decor is fun and interesting; I really liked the \"urban\" feel of it with the graffiti and colorful boom boxes, etc. There is plenty of seating especially since they have a second floor. If I had to rate just the aesthetic of the restaurant it would be 5/5.

Unfortunately I didn't think the food was as good. Overall, I think the food was just ok. I've been here on two separate occasions, so I've tried the nachos and the quesadilla. They both were sufficiently tasty, but nothing that had me wanting more.
PS. Don't make the mistake of expecting something authentic, because this is not it.

Originally I thought this would be more of a traditional restaurant but it fast food. Yet the prices reflect more of a higher end fast food joint. For the amount of food you were getting I felt the price was way too high.

Basically I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I were to end up here I wouldn't mind either."}
{"text":"Good and inexpensive food! What really puts it over the top is how attentive the owner is and it's clear she cares about the customer enjoying the food. Go with the bulgogi steak taco."}
{"text":"When it comes to any kind of Korean BBQ- I am there. It came to my attention this was a fairly new place on the U of I campus and I want to try it out. 
I was pleasantly surprised- I got a few tacos and we got the nachos (fair warning if you don't like kimchi the nachos are not for you)
The meat was good and well seasoned and the prices were fair. 
The tacos are $2.50 a piece and they come with Korean Salad Mix, Green Onion, Seoul Sauce, crushed Sesame Seeds and a wedge of Lime- and the protein options are: steak, chicken, spicy pork and tofu. 

I tried the steak taco and the tofu taco- both were good and unique in their own ways, and I got the spicy pork on the nachos which was also very good. 

The inside of this place was very trendy- defiantly a good place to grab food or just grab a snack (AKA one taco) when you are on the go and hungry. 

I definitely want to try the Gogi bowl the next time I am there."}
{"text":"Picture this: a burrito with spicy Korean beef, kimchi fried rice, crispy vegetables, and a spicy, tangy sauce. I'm happy to say that this burrito lives up to everything I hoped it would be. It's a great mix of flavors. 

The menu is fairly simple. Like many Chipotle, they have a limited amount of ingredients that you can get in a variety of configurations (e.g., tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, nachos), and I think it really works for them. They do a few things, and they do them well.

The restaurant is clean and inviting. It's a pain to get to unless you're already on campus, but it's worth the trip. Having gone a handful of times, I can vouch for its consistency."}
{"text":"Had this in St. Louis on a business trip - my co worker and I were extremely impressed! Anytime I'm in a different city I like to try \"foodie\" spots. So when I heard that Seoul Taco was coming to Champaign I was super excited! My wife and I attended the grand opening. We tried the pork, chicken and steak tacos plus a goki bowl...oh was it delicious! My wife loved her tacos and I loved my goki bowl! We will definitely be going back on the regular!"}
{"text":"Just went to the newly opened Seoul Taco earlier today. My GF and I both ordered the Goji bowls, mine with the Bulgogi Beef, and she got Chicken. They were 8 dollars each. The wait wasn't too long and we picked up our orders and immediately I felt a little disappointed. The bowls looked more like salads than anything else. At first look the bowl was loaded with leafy greens. I saw an egg and some meat in the middle, with a splattering of Gochujang on the side. At first I was wondering if there was any rice, since I didn't see it immediately. It turns out the rice is covered entirely by the egg (there isn't much rice). 

Eating it tasted pretty, except there was way too much salad and not enough rice and meat. If they were to increase the rice by 50-100% and decrease the salad proportionally, I think it would have been a much better balance. Or even offer the current version as a salad, and release a rice bowl version that has more rice. Anyways, the meat was flavorful, and the egg was perfect for me, but both were drowned in the salad. In all, I don't really think the Goji bowl was worth the 8 dollar price, there are a lot of other great options on campus at that price. If they were to lower to price or fix the proportions it might be a solid option, but I don't think I'll go again until they do."}
{"text":"that burrito is on point 

love the kimchi fried rice and the tofu was well prepped

tried to roll in for dinner at 6:00 one evening and the guy was locking up saying it was too slow - so that was pretty annoying after a trip to campus just for that burrito after confirming their hours online.
