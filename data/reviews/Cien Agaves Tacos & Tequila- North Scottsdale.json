{"text":"This restaurant took over Blue 32.  I really miss that restaurant ...   Excited to try a brand new restaurant that specializes in tacos. Unfortunately the service was not very welcoming and the food was definitely not up to par. Dare to say it Rubio's tacos is even better than this place. The only reason why this place will last beyond six months would be because of alcohol.  I guess when you're drunk their food will taste great. Just saying."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland \"Mexican\" food at high prices.  We must have been there after a staff meeting urging waiters to check on customers.  Every two minutes someone asked if everything was ok, and asked to refill our drinks.  No complaints about the wait staff.  Food was just too bland.  They scrimped on the amount of cream cheese, served with the quesadilla.  The meat in the salad was finely chopped, so they could use less meat.  I would of preferred strips of chicken.  I ordered the jalape√±o dressing for the salad.  It had absolutely no heat.    They have pages of drinks, probably where they put their emphasis, rather than on the food."}
{"text":"I thought of giving 1 star but their Nachos are good so 2 stars. Flys in dine area sitting in the food is a big turn off and 1 of the side plate they served is not clean, not sure how it made it to customer table as the first rule of the restaurant is to wipe the plates with a clean cloth immediately once they are out of dishwasher(I worked in few restaurants while I am studying). In this case that was not done. Coming back to Fly, it touched all my food and I simply stopped eating after that. Simply bad experience."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this restaurant...very average, would be nice to just have a good basic cheese crisp.  The place looks a little unorganized and incomplete.  Positive note, staff was friendly and engaged."}
{"text":"This location was in dire need of a good restaurant and we finally got it!  Cien Agaves food is delicious and the staff is wonderful!  The restaurant decor is beautiful.  Taco Tuesday's has a wonderful band and wonderful drink and eat specials.  I highly recommend Cien Agaves."}
{"text":"Really bad service. But really good food. Just like the downtown Scottsdale location this one has really good food. Love the Tinga Tacos and the fajita bowls. Unfortunately, the service is really bad. We've been here 4 or 5 times and each time the service has been bad. The servers are not attentive and just want to rush you out of the restaurant. Might just have to go downtown when we need our Mexican fix."}
{"text":"I am so excited Cien Agaves opened this new location! This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Scottsdale. They have an awesome variety of tequila and have the best Margaritas. I always get the fresh guacamole and queso dip. I love their fresh salads, burritos and fajitas. They also have a great deal for Taco Tuesday's! Great design inside, fun and comfortable. I am definitely putting this place in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Nothing like the old town location!!!! Service was fake and very unpleasant.  Food was average at best.  Atmosphere was blah. Without service, food and atmosphere you don't really have a restaurant.  Even at that, Old Town location is AWESOME!!!! This one won't last."}
{"text":"Stopped in with T ( and later joined by Jim ) for our first visit to Cien Agaves ( I've not been to the Scottsdale location ) and I can already say I'm a fan and will be back. We were immediately warmly greeted by one of the owners, Roque, and shown a seat at the bar. Nicole was behind the bar and took great care of us. As we'd never been here before she was able to recommend some items to try.   The house margarita is very tasty. There might have been a tad too much ice for my liking but this really can't detract from the flavor, so I'd highly recommend it. The selection of Tequilas is really impressive as well, so you have a plethora of choices for you refreshment needs.    As to the food, we of course started off with chips and salsa. The chips are, in my opinion, above par: crisped and browned just enough, lending them a fantastic flavor that stood on their own. Served with two salsas, a red and green. The red was my favorite, just enough kick without being overpowering. The green very good as well, a little stronger with a great flavor to it.  Also on the happy hour menu we chose the Tinga Tacos, consisting of shredded chicken breast that's braised in chipotle sauce in a crispy tortilla with cheddar, lettuce, tomato and a Mexican crema. Wow! This needs to be a staple for my visits from now on, though of course I'll be sampling other menu items.   The restaurant is roomy and nicely laid out, with an extensive bar. The back bar is really well done, nicely lighted and showcases a wide variety of spirits. A lively, colorful mural dominates one wall and the overall decor is engaging without being overdone. There's a patio area that opens up adjacent to one end of the bar that will be a great spot to sit in the nicer weather.   The staff is great; even for having been open only a few days, and with some attendant learning curves, everyone was fun, enthusiastic and very friendly. Nicole made sure we were taken care of and topped off whenever we needed. Roque took a lot of time to chat with us and share his passion for the restaurant.   Cien Agaves is located just adjacent to the Harkins 101 Theaters so it should do quite well, and deservedly-so. It feels like a place that will be a regular spot for us. Make sure you check it out, grab a delicious margarita and definitely sample those Tinga Tacos."}
{"text":"None of us really enjoyed our food, it was quite dry and reminded me of Chipotle level quality."}
{"text":"Worst New Year's Eve dinner ever. 6 pm and the place was barely half full. The service was so bad we considered leaving. They got our order wrong for our margaritas and then never brought us chips and salsa even though we asked three times. We all ordered the three taco plates and the tacos were so greasy they were inedible. The rice that came with the tacos was dried out and almost burned. Bill was $92 before tip. Terrible. I don't know how the Old Town location gets such great reviews but I'd stay away from this location until they get their service issues AND food quality issues worked out. Many other places near the Harkins 101 to grab a good bite that  are so much better."}
{"text":"Good food. Price is fair.  I know this can be better. Just needs a push to get to 5 stars.  Don't know what that push is but something is missing."}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible.  The food, the service, everything is just terrible.  The food was as bland and dried out as cardboard.  The service left a lot to be desired.  End Game:  There are much better Mexican Restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Very avg in every aspect. Hard to imagine why we can't get authentic mexican food in North Scottsdale but that's our sad reality. Wife and I had shrimp and fish tacos that were a C- at best.  Very unimaginative and lacked flavor. Guacamole seemed like it was out of a package, def not made fresh and came out late.  Margaritas were watery.  Sorry but will not return."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Cien Agaves in North Scottsdale countless times since my first review and have had great experiences each time.  My husband, who's a big fan of frozen margaritas, was always a bit disappointed by the quality at Cien Agaves.  We would sometimes go over to Blue Agave to get a frozen margarita and then head over to Cien Agave for dinner.  But low and behold, Cien Agaves has purchased new machines which make high quality frozen margaritas and my husband is a big fan. Thanks for continuing to make improvements."}
{"text":"Wow! This place doesn't disappoint. It's uptown sports bar meets  downtown Mexico in a beautiful courtship. The atmosphere is warm and inviting with the right amount of \"sports\" flare. The variety of tequilas is second to none and there's no \"well\" tequila here, everything's top shelf. The food is authentic and full  of flavor and not to be outdone the presentation is outstanding, so beautiful you hate to bite into it. Overall just a great experience. Thank you Olivia for the wonderful service and knowledge."}
{"text":"Can I do 10 stars!? I'm telling you...hands down...the best Mexican food I've ever had! And I have had a lot!  First of all the chips and salsa were perfect.  The chips were crispy and tasted amazing.  They give you 2 different salsas and they were both delicious.  The fajitas were.... omg... and the corn tortillas... omg.  So corny! Lol definitely homemade.  We also had the tostadas and I loved how there were 4 separate ones.   It was all just so damn good!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this place up North!  I love the food and atmosphere in the original location, but couldn't get down as often as I liked.  I had the fajita bowl recently and it was awesome, but my favorite is always the chimichanga with red sauce."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves has the best tacos in the Valley! Love the Old Town location, its rustic and a little hidden gem.  This newest location is stunning and the food amazing.  Kudos to the owners!"}
{"text":"The food here is okay. Nice atmosphere. Nice people. Service is friendly, though spotty.  We'd heard good things, and hoped to add another nearby Mexican restaurant to our thumbs-up list for taking out-of-town guests, but this place didn't make the cut. Green salsa is a cut above, so we were hopeful at first, but the tacos just don't deliver...shredded beef was very much like Taco Bell, and Rubio's makes better fish tacos. Plus, the rice and refried beans are bland.   Maybe this place, like so many in N. Scottsdale, is aimed mostly at capturing snowbird business and so geared around Midwestern palates...but that's not us, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Love Cien Agave!!! We started going to the Old Town location right when they opened... then we moved up north, but would eat there every time in Old Town. We were so happy to see they were opening a location up NORTH!!! The high quality of both food and drinks moved with the location. Their menu is diverse enough for all eaters. The decor is beautiful and this location is so spacious... great patio area!!! We will defiantly become regulars at the new location!  Favorite foods include green salsa, cream of poblano soup, ceviche, fajitas, tacos... you really can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"Disappointingly average. We had high hopes going to this location however were underwhelmed with the service and food. We just ate here for Cinco de Mayo and it looked like one server was covering most of the tables. He did a good job considering his endeavor however he was rushed and at times was impolite because of how much he had to do. I would like to say it was because of the amount of people but the restaurant was nowhere near busy (roughly 8:00pm on a Saturday). Food came out relatively quick, however again, I can't say it was above average by any means. For showcasing their awards on their menu, I expected much more. With as much competition of Mexican restaurants in the area, you unfortunately can't be average. We won't be back as there are too many places that are similar and viable options (2 more in the same strip mall!)."}
{"text":"Tried Cien last night.  Only 6 people there, not a good sign.  Menu looked great.  The $10 Margaritas were good.  The chips tasted like they were bought at Albertsons, the salsa was as thin and tasteless as water.  The quac was only fairly decent because of the pomegranate seeds.  Now lets talk tacos.  We each had two tacos, no beans, and rice.  The shredded beef was ok. The chicken was not edible and we sent them back.  I dont recommend this restaurant, I wanted to like this place because it is close to home.  My waitress was nice and polite, I feel sorry for her, how can she make money here with no people there."}
{"text":"Reaaaaaaally bad service. Gringo mex food. We won't be returning with better options in town. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere with outdoor seating area and live music.  Geat tacos and best salsa ever!"}
{"text":"Wow what a terrible experience. The server was unable to answer even the most basic questions about the menu or beer. I had to get up and get my own rolls of flatware for my girlfriend and myself. The appetizer was sent out at the same time as our entrees which apparently sat under a heat lamp for an excessive period of time because everything was dried up. The server didn't even check in till after I was able to choke down the meal. I could have received a better experience at the Denny's across the street. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this place!!  The salsas weren't very good at all (one overly sweet and one had an off sour taste) but the chips are excellent.    Our main issue was three of our party wanted a la carte enchiladas.  Ordered them and got the bill--they were 5 cents more than the plates with rice and beans.  The server never told us--hey, the plate is a better deal.  Their pricing needs some work   We are sticking to Carlos OBriens in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a wonderful happy hour on a Friday night. Place is new so it wasn't packed yet, but it will be. It's right near the movie theater, which makes a great dinner and a movie option. The list of tequilas is outstanding, and they have a great variety of food. Happy hour discounts on appetizers make this an easy choice when in the area. House margarita is delicious."}
{"text":"Best margaritas ever. Trust me, I've tried them all ;)  If you want to learn about what tequila really is, come here(for those that don't know Cien agaves translates roughly to \"100 tequilas\").   Also, the food is awesome, the atmosphere is full of cool art and local Az culture!"}
{"text":"Though I've only visited the bar, I always receive superior service! The margaritas are perfect; not too sweet and just the right amount for the price. In fact, I don't think I've seen such and extensive margarita and tequila menu before!  Great place to drink and dine before or(and) after a movie, or to relax, grab a bite and catch a game."}
{"text":"So happy to see another location for Cien Agaves.  We love the Old Town Scottsdale restaurant, but this is much closer.   Always have to order the guacamole, it's a perfect start to dinner.  Had the Island Shrimp tacos, spicy and delicious. Always pleased with the size of the shrimp. Finished up with the Churro Sunday, so good. We always feel welcome and the service was spot on! Be back soon."}
{"text":"So far the margs were three sips and way too expensive, the gauqamole was bland and has middle eastern pomegranate in it, the salsa red and green is less than Pace one of my lessor salsas let's see where the entre takes me. The brought me a bowl of red salsa, the waiter was from Wisconsin and the manager was a young blonde woman that knew nothing about Sonoran Mexican food. Another corporate top off trying to bill themselves as upscale Scottsdale and an absolute food failure  Stick to anything that ends in berto may not have atmosphere but the price is right and the food is authentic"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because of the HH specials, but the service was unbelievably horrible. It was 4pm on a Sunday and not very busy. We sat for 15 minutes without anyone greeting us or bringing water. I ask the hostess to let our server know that we are ready to order, we had a move to go to at 5pm. I go back to the table and sit for awhile with no response, then I ask the hostess to seat us in a different section where we could possibly have our order taken. A short meeting take place at the hostess stand where she explains the situation to two servers who eye me up and down and clearly decide that they do not want to serve our table (I am a brown woman). I tell the hostess we just an appetizer and a drink, if she could just put in the order. Eventually someone comes over, I do not think he was even a server and was just trying to help out. We gulped down our nachos in under 10 minutes and were still late to our movie. I'll go to Blue Agave next time, it's a little further from the theater but the service is reliable."}
{"text":"I am totally 'Cien' percent sure that I will certainly give this place an absolute 2nd chance. I was so excited to learn such an amazing happy hour was taking place on my neighborhood. This is actually the best happy hour around. 3pm to 7 pm every single day... Even Sunday's. It really does not get any better. Appetizers and margaritas at 50% are about to make my week more 'happy'. I will try some other dishes for sure. The ceviche, & the Cien Agaves margarita was a bit of a let down. The happy hour taco option and the Pozole were a bit better option. I shall be back though, and give it a second try for sure"}
{"text":"I could not rave enough about this place. First, when you walk in the ambiance is fantastic. They have an awesome bar, but also a very family friendly dining area. The paintings and music are impeccable.   After looking at the menu everything is fairly priced, and their happy hour is unbeatable. If you're a tequila fanatic they are extremely knowledgeable, and sold us multiple amazing margaritas. I ordered the Skinny and Pomegranate margaritas, and my husband had the Cadillac and Habanero. They each had a deliciously unique taste, highly recommend trying. We then proceeded to order the queso verde and green chili cheese crisp with carnitas, these were recommended by a server and our expectations were definitely exceeded. I then ordered a fajita bowl with diabla shrimp and my husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were once again amazing.   Our waitress was extremely attentive, and the overall service staff was very polite. To follow up a manager even came by to ask about our experience, which was very personable and polite. For only being open since November they definitely impressed us, and we are extremely excited to return. (If only my bank account and metabolism let me eat like this every night!)"}
{"text":"I do not recommend, little pricey but there were some mistakes that make me not return. Only their third day open, but first impressions mean the most. Just stopped in for lunch, my husband and I ordered the Old town steak burritos. The meal was supposed to include beans and guacamole, as evidence by my photo, they skipped on those two items, asked the server Alexander for the beans and was happy to bring us two sides of beans and said the cooks are not familiar with the menu yet, all was fine until Alexander came back and said the beans will be on the house. WTH? Nobody knows their menu, clearly states served with beans and he even asked us when ordering if we wanted black or refried beans. I ordered my burrito enchilada style for an additional 1.95 and I agreed to my servers idea of extra sauce which I ended up being double charged for, thanks for not telling me that tip and it was more like light sauce."}
{"text":"Very pleased! Food was great - got a few house margaritas and a carnitas burrito. It came out with rice on the side instead of beans, but that was quickly corrected. Margaritas were great! Bartender was friendly and attentive (sat at the bar). Everything was very reasonably priced. Cool looking place - nice outdoor and indoor seating. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Margarita's are the best hard to find better, the street tacos are some of my favorite. I like afternoon lunches here as they have fast WiFi and great staff. Which allows me to eat better and accomplished work."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cute. Had the skinny margarita which was really good. Had the fajita salad with shrimp diablo. It was a generous portion with mixed greens, sweet corn, black beans, tomatoes, avocado and shrimp diablo (also available with chicken or steak). My friend had the fajita bowl, also with shrimp diablo and also commented on the amount of shrimp served was nice. We sat on the patio - good ambiance. I saw they gave happy hour everyday from 3-6 so I'll definitely go back and try some $1 tacos!!"}
{"text":"After several stops in, I think it's time I write a review. I live across the street, and this is quite convenient for me. I spend a lot of time in this shopping center, and have watched it evolve quite a bit in the last two years since I moved in. Initially, I thought to myself - geez. ANOTHER Mexican place? There are 3 other Mexican varieties in this shopping center alone - not to mention the countless other places nearby. CIen Agaves must be quite confident to move in an area so highly populated with Mexican food. Honestly - they have every right to be. 2 of the 3 places in the center aren't that good in the food department, and Cien Agaves feels different than the place that actually does taste good. They have a fighting chance! I've had 5 varieties of the a la carte tacos - all delicious. My favs are the tinga chicken and the papas - but the others I've tried are all top notch! I've had a few other things, and I've also had some catering at a private event that was delightful. I've had a couple of margaritas - the cucumber and the beer-garita being my top 2 choices. All around I'd say welcome to the 'hood!"}
{"text":"Ok.... this place has a rally cool vibe! The artwork on the walls is great! Bartender was super sweet and helpful with recommendations! Habanero margarita is delicious!! And are you kidding me.... these nachos are impressive! Owner Rocky was very friendly and gave me some of the background of the place. Glad I found a new Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Harry was the nicest customer service take out order I have ever had he was so pleasant ! Food was great but the harry customer service blew me out of the park and didn't make me feel bad about all my food allergies I will always be a customer!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at this location. We haven't been to the original location since they opened up here because we live in Cave Creek. I was so excited because we loved the original location and this is so close. Well, the margaritas are decent, but still not as good. Maybe both locations changed their recipe? Today I tried the Chicken Tinga Quesadilla. I was not impressed. It was a tortilla with a bit of cheese and chicken. I opened it up and took a pic. You would think I picked at it, but I did not. I had to take the two pieces and merge them into one for the desired amount of ingredients. Are they skimping on ingredients because it's happy hour? Old Towne never use to, but it's been a long time. I will give it one more try on Mayo and go to Old Towne and make my decision. I'm not impressed, but I would love to be!"}
{"text":"My experience here today was so awful it was downright laughable.   When I arrived-there were maybe 4 occupied tables in the entire place. The kid who waited on me was so stoned his eyes were barely open. I had to bite my tongue to keep from asking \"hey, are you in there?\"   I ordered a margarita on the rocks, no salt. He repeats my order back to me and walks away. 5 seconds later he walks back and asks me what I ordered.   Eventually he brings me my drink and takes my food order. I asked for a water. (Isn't it the law, you always bring a water with alcohol?) I sat there and waited for him to bring me chips and salsa since everyone around me was being served theirs. My food comes out and the delivery waiter asked if I needed anything so I asked him for the chips and salsa, since my waiter clearly couldn't be bothered. Thankfully he brought it out within a few minutes.   I was nearly finished with my meal when my original waiter comes over and asks how my food was and if I needed anything so I took this opportunity to ask for a box. The look on his face was hilarious. I don't know what he thought I asked for but he looked at me like I asked for a kidney. He walks away, cleans off a table, wanders around a bit and then remembered (or figured out) that I asked for a box and drops one off with my check.  I immediately put my debit down and the waiter walks by me at least 4 more times and leaves my check and card right there at the edge of the table. Finally another waiter (who I think had taken notice of my waiter) takes my card to run it.   My original waiter brings it back and walks off.   All in all-chips and salsa were good  Chicken fajitas were okay  Cucumber margarita-not the best, not the worst I've had  Water-no clue. I think my waiter is still looking for it  Wait staff-everyone but the stoned waiter seemed to be okay.   Would I come back- there are a ton of other restaurants in the same plaza. There are even two other taco joints in there. I don't think I'd come back. There are far better places in there. Even chick fil a has better service in their drive thru."}
{"text":"Now this a brand new location; the other resides in Old Town Scottsdale. I had the pleasure of speaking with Roque (one of the owners) of Cien Agave (100 Agave Cacti) for you out of town clan. Rocky designed the inside of the establishment and did a fantastic job! It is beautiful.   We sat at the bar which lends sight to an eye level shelf that runs the length of the bar that encompasses a wide array of eclectic and upscale tequilas. My favorite is the Classe Azul Platinum.  The patio is situated on the east end of the restaurant and lends easy access to the bar. They had just opened two days ago when Twyla, Phil and I popped in. However, I did not notice the normal kinks that you see in the early goings of a new establishment. Hats off to you.  I had a Green Chili Pork Cheese Crisp and it was delicious. The whole menu looks inviting and we will be back to suck down margaritas and try other fare. Being off the 101 and Mayo makes this a great location for eating prior to heading to the Princess Resort for their annual Christmas extravaganza or the Phoenix Open for that matter. Come and check them out. It is well worth a visit.  #Vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #IrishcatV2"}
{"text":"Excellent drinks, great service, amazing food (the guacamole is literally  heaven on a plate). Really cool decor and very clean and friendly, TVs everywhere (shades of the sports bar it used to be) good music! What's not to love? The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I asked for water four times. We will be back for sure, so many tacos and so little time."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Scottsdale 101 area! My boyfriend and I came here last night and we enjoyed it. Started off with delicious chips and salsa. Salsa is a little too liquid-y but the flavor was very tasty for the red salsa. I wasn't as into the green salsa. My boyfriend and I both got the three tacos with rice and beans. It was very good! My boyfriend got a grilled fish taco, fried fish, and shrimp. He liked the fish ones but said the shrimp wasn't great, he just didn't like the sauce on it mostly. I got two veggie tacos and 1 potato. Potato taco was a little bland. Veggie tacos were delicious but too much grease! Beans and rice were tasty, also I got a small guacamole and they gave me a bunch! It was yummy too. My boyfriend also got the corn and it was very good. We left totally stuffed and happy. Wasn't crazy expensive, service was good. I'd be glad to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Old Town Cien Agaves for years and love, love, love them.  I took a trip up to the new location on Mayo Blvd. and fell in love with this place too.  The margaritas are just as delicious as the first location and so is the food and service.  Olivia the bartender was awesome!  Great food, drink and service."}
{"text":"Update: Unfortunately it seems if you try to come here on any day and time other than a Sunday at 3 o'clock you can expect total incompetence from the management and staff. Got there at 5:30 on a Friday, was quoted a 25 minute wait, 35 minutes later the hostess tells us there were still four more tables ahead of us and can't tell me how much longer it was going to be. In the meantime, there are two other people complaining about the same thing while simultaneously the hostess is telling new people it will be a 10-15 minute wait (no exaggeration) ...plus there are four clean and fully set up tables available as well as two dirty ones that literally remained that way the entire time we were there. When I asked to talk to the manager, he fed me a bunch of gibberish about reservations being late and people \"hanging out\" that made zero sense. BTW he also could  not tell me how much longer it was going to be....seriously, his answer was \"not too long\".After almost 40 minutes and no progress, we just left.   My advice to the senior management; hire adults with some common sense and basic time management skills, not millennials that still cherish their participation trophies and clearly don't give a s#it. Lastly I just want to say thanks for fu@king up our Friday night. By the time we finally pulled the plug and tried to go to another spot, we were looking at an hour wait so we just went back home.  Very good food and decent service. Not a fan of Pepsi vs Coke products which is mostly why four stars instead of five and also the cocktails are on the skimpy side unless of course you order the huge margarita."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give 3.5 stars but the food was really good. Sketchy service. Maybe just teething problems but the awesome cheese crisp appetizer came out with the main course. Then had to ask for cutlery after our food came out. Tacos were really good. Our server was friendly. We will go back and hopefully give it 5 stars. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Save your money! This restaurant needs a major overhaul already.First, the atmosphere - or lack thereof. It's a big barn of a place with ear splitting music. The patio, however, is a good spot to see and be seen. The food is underwhelming. Think skimpy portions and high prices. A 6\" tortilla with a tiny amount of filling plopped in the middle is not my idea of a taco. If you want a real taco go to Carlos O'brien in the same complex. We won't even discuss the salsa - not good. The service - almost laughable! Amateurish to a fault. Cute little teeny boppers just out of high school (maybe) who know nothing about the menu and less about drinks from the bar. They mean well but have not been trained. I predict an early demise for this place unless major improvements are made to the pricing, the portion sizes and the service. The competition is too heavy including one in the same complex a few parking spots down the way."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS!!!! I am all about supporting local businesses. I went in with my child to check out the place just to peek in. We then came back 5 minutes later to get s menu and the hostess yelled at me in front of my child and said that we were lottering. It is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Also great happy hour 1/2 off appetizers, 1/2 off house margarita, and $3 Mexican draft beers."}
{"text":"Attended the Grand Opening of the new North Scottsdale location. Had a great time, food was great (especially the jalapeno cheese crisp) and Mariachi band was on point. Staff was great. Alexa handled our party (which stared with 4 then later expanded) with ease and especially since we were on separate checks.  The rest of the staff didn't looked phased at all with all the people coming in/out for the opening. Great to see Santa (aka Harry) made an appearance for the kids. Location is right next to the movie theatre which is even better.  I may live in the East valley but, would definitely be back (with pics)"}
{"text":"The food is just ok. Portion sizes are very small for a Mexican food place. They messaed up my Togo order as well. Not a fan."}
{"text":"As a long-time patron of the original Old Town location, we were excited to try the new location! Definitely recommend and best part is (besides the margaritas) THIS IS A LOCAL COMMUNITY BUSINESS,.   The patio is huge, and conveniently located outside the Cine Capri. A great spot to drop in before or after a movie. This place will be packed now that the weather is perfect.   We always get the House margs and they are spot on the same consistency as the original. Same with the food. We can never stop eating the chips and salsa so getting our meals always means leftovers since the potions are good sized.   Our favorites to try: * Queso - creamy with chunks of pork and tomatoes, the blend of real cheeses they use are perfect. (Not the liquid crap we've had elsewhere).  * Tinga Tacos - Both their shredded chicken and shredded beef tacos are delicious. The hard shells are just the right amount of crunchy   They do have the creme on top, FYI, so if you're not a fan make sure to request without.  * Ceviche - SO DELICIOUS! Shrimp is very fresh and the blend of veggies mixed in is definite can't miss appetizer on a hot day.  * House Marg - never liked tequila before trying one 10 years ago at the original location. Was used to a turpentine flavor that most chain places serve so hated it. Tried one at Cien and GAME CHANGER!! I love tequila now and won't drink margs anywhere else except at home :)"}
{"text":"The worst service....hostess jammed my foot with a high chair, 10 minutes to get waters, 15 minutes  for chips, forgot our appetizer, cold and dry shrimp enchiladas, cold beans with unmelted cheese, waiter didn't know menu, got my order wrong, not one refill on beverages, no salsa refills,overcharged us for tortillas we didn't ask for, forgot to go boxes, took 20 minutes for our check, then gave us a card for 2-1 margs that I away to someone in the parking lot. Tried calling manager later and didn't get a call back."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good happy hour, and this place is a hit. Came on Tuesday to check the place out, with some friends, and ended up coming back tonight to snag another quick drink and bite before a movie. Happy hour is from 3-7, and offers half off appetizers and a $4 house margarita that's great. I started snapping pics on the second visit but was so excited once the food arrived, I was easily distracted on the picture-taking task. Perhaps next time. My only concern is the place hasn't quite caught on yet, and still seems slower than it should be. Anyway, I'll be frequenting this happy hour again."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Will not try this place again we called and asked if they had tables available and they said yes, we got there about 5 minutes later and they said they couldn't since we didn't have a reservation and refused to push tables together as we are looking at SEVERAL tables available horrible management and piss poor planning"}
{"text":"Schyler was a great server, he really knew his stuff! He was able to guide me through the menu and help me find exactly what I wanted. Not to mention the restaurant itself looks great. Lots of tv's to watch games and a great atmosphere. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. It's kinda hidden away but when you find it, you will enjoy.  The food is fresh and tasty. Several different types of tacos, all tasty. Fajitas are equally as good  the the fajita bowl is particularly tasty. Mine had grilled chicken but you can get stake or Shrimp As well.  Everything I've tried tastes good, Favorite is the fajita bowl or the green chili pork which also comes as an appetizer with cheese!! Wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Bartender Nicole is awesome and generally super fast with food or drink. I like getting the \"Mexican Coke\" in a bottle and scanning the big screen TV's.  All in all, it's a great Experience any time of the day. You will most likely run into Rocky(sp) the owner and he is just a solidly nice guy who is Intent on taking care of customers. Give it a try, you won't be Disappointed."}
{"text":"We walked in as a party of 2 at 5 o'clock on a Saturday. The hostess proceeded to tell us that there would be a 20-25 minute wait, this seemed odd as I counted 12 open tables between the restaurant, and patio. Regardless we decided to wait rather unpleased. As we were seated our server greeted us promptly but never stated her name. We asked about the house margarita and how it was and she told us that it was pre-mixed and that honestly she it wasn't that good but it was \"award winning\" truly, the only award this margarita could have possibly won is the worst margarita in town award. It tasted identical to a margarita I would order at a cheap resort in Rocky Point. After being thoroughly disappointed by the margarita, we proceeded to order the cheese crisp and chicken tinga tacos. The tacos were absolutely awful to the point that neither of us ate them. I've had better tacos at Taco Bell! The cheese crisp wasn't awful, but it was indeed cold, some areas of it were Luke warm at best. Honestly the worst Mexican food I have ever had, and I've been to just about every Mexican restaurant in the valley. I was thoroughly disappointed by my visit and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yummy!! who's doesn't love a large selection of tequila and tacos!!  I keep trying something new every-time and always find something new I love. Go to favorites so far are the Cadillac margaritas and a 3 taco plate mixing it each time!! Let's make a combo enchilada platter! Let's mix those up too!! See you next taco Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a couple tacos and had the chicken tinga, shredded beef, and carne asada. I think my favorite if the three was the shredded beef which was served in a crispy taco and was rich in cumin and chili flavors. They have all kinds of different types of tacos, and a lot of fish tacos. I definitely want to go and try their other tacos and see a movie at the Harkins next door- great idea for dinner and a movie!"}
{"text":"It was nice to see a new place take over this building (though we now have 4 mexican restaurants in the parking lot).  Cien is just wonderful.  They have some of the best street tacos I've ever had.  One thing that did stand out... their quesidillas.  Good God.. they are amazing! We usually go here after or before a movie.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Menu looks great and they have happy hour everyday from 3:00-7:00!!! Nice atmosphere and next door to harkins so very convenient to grab dinner before a movie. However,  very slow service- from the time I sat at the bar with only four other people at the bar and already drinks in front of them,  it took 11 minutes before the bartender came over to ask me what I would like to drink and the other guy who was clearing the bar never even asked if I wanted a water while I waited. Understandable if it was busy, but I sat and watched the employees chat with the bartender at the other end while I waited for service  Chicken Quesadilla from the appetizer menu took over 15 minutes, came with only a side of sour cream and no salsa offered I had ask .... at a Mexican restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"Finding this restaurant to be a new, easy stomping ground situation. $5 house margaritas and half off apps 3-7pm everyday. Does it get better? Try me. The staff is attentive and kind! Have only had positive experiences here- and look forward to my next stop in."}
{"text":"I am a college student at ASU and I drive 30 minutes to Cien Agaves and 30 minutes back to my house just to be served by the lovely bartender and server Caroline. She makes my experience at Cien Agaves wonderful every time! Love the food and great customer service by the staff! Highly recommend to anyone looking for quality mexican food in north scottsdale!"}
{"text":"no star.  my wife and son and his wife plus grandson came in for dinner on 02/22/2018 and was told 30 minutes. after waiting 20 minutes and seeing at least 4 open booths 3 guys came in and after they waited 20 minutes they got seated at a high top table and we still had to wait i asked why someone who comes in 20 minutes later then us would get seated when there where all these booths available she said we need to wait. i thought as i left why cant a server from the high top area serve us at the booth. you lost a customer"}
{"text":"OMG! 1st timers. Happy Hour M-S till 7! Wife says best margarita she's ever had. Ice cold Mexican beer. All apps 1/2 off. Don't recommend the guacamole. Good atmosphere, great to watch sports, service is ok. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible staff , walked past few times with out saying anything had to bring it to her attention we were waiting over 10min to order didn't apologize say sorry or anything"}
{"text":"Enter the restaurant, ask for a table for two outside. The hostess stated it'll be about ten minutes because they have four available tables but \"we're really busy and we only have one person clearing tables\".   Nice attitude right off the bat. Second person comes to the waitstand. Oh...she only seats people because the hostess only greets people.   I swear, younger people have zero idea about customer service and won't do anything out of \"their job description\".   Finally get seated. $4 happy hour margarita tastes like a $4 margarita...no tequila, all mix.   Ordered the guacamole...not memorable. I had three tacos (mix and match). Again, unremarkable. My wife had the chicken fajitas. Meh. Also unremarkable. Very little taste to the entire meal.   So, it's your typical Scottsdale unremarkable Mexican Restaurant I wouldn't return to."}
{"text":"Where are the bartenders? Or is it the severs? I have never been here where on a busy or slow night that it has been THIS slow to get a drink. I don't know what changed but there are plenty of other places in this complex to go to get a quick bite and drink."}
{"text":"Went here with friends and we had a great time! Love this place! So glad these guys expanded and opened another location!"}
{"text":"Got our table within the amount of time hostess said (20mins).  Excellent service.  Manager stopped by to see how we were.  Great happy hour.  Usual mexican faire."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is pretty good! We ordered 6 different tacos, enchilada, and the street corn. 1/2 of the food was great, the other half was just okay. The don't have queso unless you order the appetizer option with chorizo in it. The guacamole was kind of bland, but the pomegranate seeds gave it a nice flavor."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of visiting both Cien Agaves locations, Old Town Scottsdale and their newest edition on Mayo Blvd.  Both offer a great ambience with fun decor.  The food is always fantastic, high quality and noticeably fresh ingredients.  My personal favorites are the creamy poblano soup,  the Beets by Cien bowl, and the Pappas Con Queso taco.  All the fish tacos are amazing, especially the Grilled Mahi Mahi taco.  The refried beans are another I must mention, unlike most restaurants they do not use lard in their beans.  Lard is obsolete in this restaurant, an item I commonly question when dining out.  The service is always friendly and welcoming.  Whether you are a local or just passing through, Cien Agaves is a must try!"}
{"text":"Traveled to Arizona with a group of female collegiate athletes over winter break.    The team typically goes to a Mexican restaurant because they love the chips, guac, queso and salsa right after a hard workout.  Cien Agaves was a hit!  Everything was seasoned well and fresh.   I made the reservation to accommodate our group of 34 with no issue.  They put us on the climate controlled patio with a cozy atmosphere.   Some of the food came out in waves and one table finished eating before another had received food, but this is common when eating with and ordering off the menu.   They had very friendly and flexible staff, we plan to return again next year!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with an outdoor patio.  Drinks and bartenders were great.  Very good margaritas, even the house margaritas - not sticky- syrupy cloying like you get so often at other restaurants.  I really liked the shrimp tacos and look forward to trying other things on the menu.  Service was very good.  Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by quickly before the movie and had a great experience! The bartender, Caroline was so nice and attentive! I don't like sweet drinks so she offered to cut down the sweetness in a margarita for me. Shout out to her! The salsa and guacamole were both very tasty. If we're in the area again, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and bar!  We came up here because of how well they do down in old town, food is spot on, and service is great.  Kudos to the owners and management!"}
{"text":"Service was meh - now mind you, it was during the Phoenix Film Festival, but the Festival is 2 weeks, so management could have staffed better.  Also, the Food was bland and texture was off.  I always clean my plate.  Not this time.  Might be back, to try again, but with all the options nearby prob not.  The restaurant was clean, and the layout was good."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. Chips and Queso Dip were really good. Chicken Enchiladas are really tasty. Only complaint would be the they serve Pepsi products instead of Coca-Cola but I was forewarned by one of my friends so we brought our own Diet Cokes LOL."}
{"text":"The absolute best place for TACOS! Don't wait for Taco Tuesday! Very consistent with food and very delicious ! We have only sat at the bar the handful of times we have been here but great service and great vibes. My favorite is the Carne Asada taco's ... YUM!"}
{"text":"Finally! A happy hour that actually delivers on good deals. Great prices and good appys. We had the green chili cheese crisp and the ceviche and both were very tasty. $4 margaritas isn't too shabby either.  I am crossing my fingers that they will add wine to their happy hour special soon. Service was efficient and friendly. Next time I will have dinner."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. The server looked super stressed and in a rush. I waited 30 minutes for subpar tacos and cheese crisp. On a positive note my kids were impressed with the potato taquito. If I was going to see a movie, I would maybe stop in again and get a drink. This is not the type of place I would crave coming back to."}
{"text":"Grand Opening was great! Tequila tasting, specials, delicious food and Santa Claus even showed up. Thank you for a great time and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome community involvement. Will be back for sure. Thank you for being a strong community partner and a great place to eat yummy food."}
