{"text":"Great food but snarly server - not rude just zero, zero people skills. Also if you want just a glass of wine with dinner, this is not the place. I sent the first glass back because the bottle had clearly been corked about a week and the second glass was still weak. At 12$ a glass, it would be nice if the wine complimented the meal. Nope. Make reservations."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, I came here for lunch today on the recommendation of the local Toronto happenings and entertainment paper (I can't remember its name, but if you live here, you will know what I mean). It's clear that this restaurant is just starting out. It was pretty empty for a Friday lunch, and the cook, who was a vegetarian, had never cooked a steak before.   That said, it was a really good meal. I had the escargot v-v as an appetizer: superb. I had the steak frites as my mains.  The vegetarian-cooked steak was extraordinary: perfectly cooked and delicious. The frites were not my style: I like a cripsy frite, and the Toronto style (not just here, but other places, too) appears to be more home-style: kinda limp, kinda greasy.  I had the macerated berries with chantilly cream for dessert: again, excellent, the berries were perfectly ripe and juicy and delicious.    I would definitely come here again: really good food."}
{"text":"Situated in the heart of Leslieville (where customers begrudgingly but dutifully line up for 30 minutes or more for weekend brunch) Le Canard Mort can't really afford to be a completely average experience if it hopes to survive here. But alas, that was our experience :(  Located right next door to the ever popular Lady Marmalade, \"The Dead Duck\" must contend with their neighbour's customer queue covering their doorway and yet, their empty seating does not seem to lure anyone in from the line up.  I guess that should have been a tell tale sign for us.  Sadly, even though we made up only 1 of the 3 full tables in the place, we had to ask  for coffee refills, ask for water refills, ask for condiments & the promised toast side dishes and wait a significant length of time for our food to arrive (about 40 mins).    My friends and I (4 of us) all commented that brunch was nothing special (we had eggs benny, forest benny, corned beef hash & the classic breakfast w sausage).  We were all tempted by the variations of benny on the menu (like the duck confit, crab & lobster) but decided the combinations sound a bit too dinner-ish for 11am. Judging by the breakfast sausage that arrived with the classic breakfast, I think we were right to err on the side of caution. It was a big hearty italian spice sausage, that while tasty, was definitely a bit much for the breakfast dish it accompanied.  Judging from other reviews on yelp, Le Canard Mort may be a little better for dinner, and certainly the decor & atmosphere is more evening style.  I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'd be reluctant to come back to try it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends and were all happy with the quality of the food and service. Like the relaxed pub like atmosphere here as well. Check it out."}
{"text":"Finally made a visit to Le Rossignol's sister restaurant, Le Canard Mort. Sat at the bar and, like usual, ordered too much!  The French onion soup was really quite nice - not too salty and with a good onion flavour. Not that I'd expect less, as I enjoyed the same soup at Le Rossignol.  On to the fried sweetbreads. Done up like Buffalo chicken wings, including a blue cheese sauce and a cucumber slaw (should have been carrots and celery!), this was a generous dish of spicy and breaded glands. Tasty, but we couldn't finish. Or well, we knew we shouldn't if we wanted to leave room for the mains.  We also had the stuffed Yorkshire pudding. This one was like a roast beef sandwich in a turnover. It was okay - interesting to have tried.  On to the mains!  Enjoyed my osso buco with a glass of wine. Good flavours, though I'd like them to be stronger and more intense. Very tasty with the mash and veg. Would recommend this.  The schnitzel was perfectly cooked and the spaetzle was delicious. The vinegary cut of the cabbage made a nice contrast to the oil/butter of the other two elements.  A decent spot to visit if you're in the neighbourhood. Comfortable space with comfort food."}
{"text":"Tried Le Canard Mort for the first time last night after having a good experience at Le Rossignol and drooling over the menu as I walked home.  The menu is truly mouthwatering.  I had a very hard time deciding what to order but ended up with the Nicoise Salad and a side order of the frites.  Both were very good.  I can't quite say excellent because I felt the Nicoise was a tiny bit light on the fish serving (I think it was pickerel) and the frites, while nice and flavourful and well cooked were just a teeny bit greasy.  The Skip and Go Naked beer cocktail was well worth the order (or 2) for what may end up being the hottest day of the summer.  It is probably not for beer purists but those of us that are happy to mix it up with more fruity beers will like it.  However, overall the experience was great.  The atmosphere is nice and the service was top notch.  There is still plenty to try on the menu and I definitely liked it enough to rank it up there on my list of favourite Leslieville restaurants (high praise) and also to consider going back there again tonight."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends fully knowing how the reviews for it stood on here.  The service was okay, food was okay, overall, just okay. I'm presuming we were served by one of the owners, an older French Canadian (?) woman. She was very nice and chatty and mostly spoke to us in French which was pretty fun since there were people in our group who could reply in French.   As for the food, we ordered the escargot poutine as a starter, which was pretty tasty. I liked the shoestring fries a lot.   For my main I ordered the tourtiere, which came with chutney and a simple pickled beet and arugula salad. The tourtiere itself wasn't hot enough, so I would have to agree with others on here regarding complaints about the lukewarm food. Maybe they were trying to serve us all at once and some of the plates sat at the food warming station too long, but that it still no excuse. Other than that issue, it was pretty tasty. The chutney went nicely with it. I tried the duck crepes my friend got and hers was even more lukewarm than mine! Yikes.  I've been to a lot of restaurants in Toronto and judging from other menus I've encountered, I have to say that everything at Le Canard Mort is overpriced when you consider the quality of the food and how the restaurant presents itself. For the amount of money I spent on that dinner and the 'meh' feeling I had afterwards, I wouldn't go back.  It was interesting to try, but there are more exciting restaurants in Toronto I'd rather eat at."}
{"text":"My second time having brunch in this restaurant, and unfortunately, a big difference from the first.  The service was slow and inept, the food was cold and a friend's scrambled eggs were undercooked.  Also, they absolutely need to do something about those low-hanging stainless steel lamps.  During the hour or so we spent there, I saw 4 people hit them with their heads.  They are ridiculous.   The only reason I won't give the restaurant 1 star is that the food would be very good if it was served hot.  I had their \"mushrooms on toast\" on my previous visit and it was absolutely delicious. This time, they were barely lukewarm.  I had eggs Benny with duck confit, served on a nice whole-grain English muffin, and I would have enjoyed it very much, if only the duck meat was hot.  Sadly, I don't see this place surviving long, especially since it's literally next door to the very popular Lady Marmalade.  We saw lineups in front of that place even though Le Canard Mort had empty tables.  In the hindsight, I wish I had lined up next door too."}
{"text":"Watch out Leslieville (and Lady Marmalade in particular) Queen St E now has another solid brunch restaurant. Right next door to Lady M. and in the former Barrio spot, Le Canard Mort is the true French Bistro contender on the Saturday Morning Eggs Benedict Crawl.   Having a tight schedule and a serious need for air-con, the SO and I decided to forgo the lineup at Lady M. and pop next door for a more civilized brunch. I had the \"Forest\" eggs Benedict which featured a selection of assorted and very woodsy mushrooms and a very fresh Hollandaise. I am not going to lie, I prefer Lady M's hollandaise, but the over all dish win has to go to LCM, with the spectacular potatoes and side salad. The food here tasted FRESH. Really nice.  The SO had a Duck Confit Benny which he loved. We both ate every bite.   Must Knows:  - Ask for salt, you get a little bowl of incredibly flaky high quality sea salt. Bonus Points. - Delicious Americano with on the house refills. (Decaf is an option)  - French Bistro Style service even at brunch. Our server was fantastic.  - Air Conditioning! - OOh and they take DEBIT! and CREDIT!   Cannot wait to try dinner here. Very welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great new Toronto East end addition. I'm a Montrealer so..very picky with my French food. Service is a little slow at the moment...but give it time to adjust to very quick popularity.   Must tries: If you're a salad lover like me, this is your place: Lobster cobb, Nicoise, & Grilled calamari salads are all delightful. Potted prawns appy,  and for brunch their signature \"Le Canard Mort\" dish. Very extensive cocktail menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally checked out this neighborhood place & was pleasantly surprised. Relaxed atmosphere, nice soft music playing in the background. Clean, warm & inviting.  Pleasant staff who are efficient, with not even a touch of the \"queen street\" attitude you often expect at these little places. I ordered two appetizers, half price as it was between 5 -7. (Bonus!)  The French onion soup was tasty & hot, authentic flavor & lots of cheese & onions (but not too much). The Caesar salad was displayed beautifully, with fresh, crisp lettuce & fresh REAL bacon bits!  Both were very filling & very worth the reasonable prices, even at full price!   I will definitely return, perhaps try the brunch, while others wait in vain for a crowded table at the over-hyped lady marmalade next door."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Leslieville that has been busy since it opened.  I went last weekend and had a very good salad nicoise - the tuna was fresh and the mix of ingredients was perfect.  I also had a bite of my girlfriends duck which was well cooked but a little too sweet for my liking.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly, although we could see right into the kitchen and I have to say the cooks did not look overly hygenic. Their uniforms were all dirty and one was wearing a filthy t-shirt that he kept touching.  I have come to believe that open kitchens are really better in concept than reality, we are better off not seeing the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen.  Aside from that though, the ambience was good as was the food.  Also, I htought the prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I was in the area to check out Lady Marmalade for Sunday brunch but there was a long line up and we were starving, so we checked out La Canard Mort.  There was only one other table with three people sitting at it, so I was slightly worried about what we would get, but we were drawn in by the different eggs benedict sold for $7.50 as a brunch special, as well as by the peach caramel french toast advertised outside.    The food was delicious - the best brunch I've had in Toronto.  The hollandaise sauce was perfect, and my friend and I shared the mushroom eggs benny and the shrimp eggs benny, along with the french toast special.  We were both stuffed when we were done, but ate every last bite.  I noticed that mimosas and caesars were also available for $3/each.  There was one server working and she was very helpful and friendly.  I liked the decor and the open windows that allowed a breeze.  The bathrooms were also really cute with old recipes posted on the walls and little face clothes to dry your hands with.    I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Room was smoky (kitchen smoke, not cigarettes) so they really will have to look at the ventilation before winter.  Very able waiter, Adam.  Great selection of interesting beer on tap at very fair prices (I think it was $6 a pint.)  The wine list though struck me as a profit making gouge - there aren't many Cote du Rhones worth $50 in a resto.  I dragged my partner down there specifically because I had read they served one of my favourite food items, sweetbreads (which are very hard to find these days and are a pain to prepare at home.) But what they did to these delicately flavoured thymus glands was a travesty (basically serve them like wings dosed in hot sauce)  and an insult to the calves that offered them up.  The pork chop was incredibly salty, to the point it made my head kinda spin (in a bad way.) Waiter explained that was a result of how they'd made it (cured I think, like bacon or duck confit). But they gotta find a way to get the curing done and then get some of the excess salt out before serving.  but overall, good value, a buzzing scene and pretty adventuresome cooking. I would try it again but will make more careful choices.  Peter  PS. Oh yea, should have added, don't forget your reading glasses and maybe a flashlight. the menu is printed in teeny tiny type almost impossible to read."}
{"text":"The initial reviews were great for this place so I was really looking forward to my visit here. Made the reservation online and showed up a little bit early. I normally don;t go to this area of town so it was a pleasant surprise to see an eclectic mix of dining options here. There were supposed to be 4 of us but one from the group couldn't make it. I ordered the Delirium Tremens one of my go to beer  when on draft, partners in crime ordered La Fin Du Monde and and interesting take on a sprtizer (I forgot what it is called it was mixture of prosecco, soda and lemonade with some black berries)  We decided to to order one appetizer of sweet breads, I ordered the Lobster pot pie, others had Steak Frites and Lobster Cob Salad. Now the wait began the service in dining area was good and our water was topped up regularly but we waited a good half and hour or so for the appetizer. The sweet breads were fried and drenched in buffalo sauce. The Batter was thick and then sauce completely over powered this delicacy. One could not even taste the sweet breads, a very surprising dish for a french place and not in a good way. Well now the wait for  mains began and it went on for a while the place was packed for a Monday but this kind of wait is bordering on unacceptable. Finally the mains arrived the lobster pot pie was like a soup the pastry crust though moist wasn't rich enough. The lobster pieces were small and bechamel sauce was too light and unlike the other lobster pot pies I have had and no taste (most of them get it with sherry I guess) The steak was too rare and lobster salad was salty. Now for a bistro style place it was underwhelming. The kitchen is quite small and maybe that explains the long wait. The service and booze options added half a star otherwise we are looking at 2.5 Star max as we paid reasonable amount of money here. The drink menu is awe inspiring with pages and pages of cocktails and a very good beer list. 3 Star with the help of service and booze selection. Its hard to recommend a bistro type place where the alcohol over shadows the food."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I wonder why we don't come more often.  Last night I had the Ducklicious prix fixe, with the duck pot pie. The starter, curried lentil and duck soup was delicious, spiced so that it was really warming. The portion wasn't huge, but it was a generous size and left enough room for 3 more courses.  The second course was a devilled duck egg with greens. Again, it was a smallish portion but the flavour was exceptional.  My duck pot pie was also awesome. Nice flaky crust, not too rich, a really savoury flavour to the filling. Husband had the duck schnitzel and hardly wanted to share because he liked it so much!  For dessert I had the pot au chocolat, it was a good size and I felt satisfied after hte meal but not overly stuffed. Husband had the banana chocolate cake and we both felt it was a bit too sweet, but the caramel sauce was good.  Glasses of wine are 6$ before 7pm, so the Ducklicious is good value especially if you get in before 7!"}
{"text":"**  Came to Le Canard Mort for Father's Day dinner.  We had made reservations in advance (not that they were needed as it was relatively empty on a Sunday), which was surprising seeing as it WAS Father's Day.  This restaurant features Alsatian cuisine run by what I presume to be a husband/wife couple.  The service was formal, but not very warm, and the food was only so-so.  We tried:  French Onion Soup - The broth needs a bit more work, not onion-y enough IMHO.  Escargots - Quite good and save the butter for dipping bread, which comes with it.  (By the way, there is no complimentary bread to be had here).  Mixed Greens Salad - Standard.  Steak Frites - Flank steak with frites and aioli.  The cut of meat itself was pretty subpar, and the steak was marinated in a vinegary sauce (presumably Balsamic).  Is it sad that the best part about this dish were the fries?  The steak definitely gave me my entire year's worth of jaw exercise.  Chewy!  Grilled Seafood Platter - Shrimp were overcooked.  The bed of vegetables it sat on may not be the most eater-friendly, especially if you're not into exotic things like undercooked potatoes, and jicama?    Veal in Mushroom Sauce - More like a mushroom broth?  It was swimming in sauce!  Came with a deep-fried mashed potato that seemed promising although I was disappointed as it was bland.   I will add, however, that their wine is quite good.  Our mains were all brought out separately, with half the table having gone through half their entrée before the other half got theirs.    With tax and tip, our bill came to about $215 for 5 people (sans dessert and not everyone had wine).  For that price, I can think of much better places to satisfy my craving for French food.   Maybe the duck isn't the only thing dying at this restaurant..."}
{"text":"I'm offering up a three star rating for this one.  First, in the nature of indeed judging a book by it's cover, I do love the name.  It conjures up all kinds of silly images in my head that make me want to cartoon on the dining napkins.  Excellent.  Secondly, I enjoyed the decor.  Striped banquet tables with seating to accommodate both small and large parties, paired with shiny, yet understated industrial lighting made for an appropriate venue.  There is a large dark wood bar in the back, if that scene is more your thing.  Service was quick and efficient, if not a bit sharp.  But, how was the food, you ask?     Well, the food, was, along with the cool name, 3 stars.  I sampled a white off of a tidy, easy wine list, alongside the caesar to start.  Lots of parm cheese.  Next, came the scallop cassoulet, in which, referencing the menu now, seems to be an amendment.  This dish usually has duck confit, but I'll accept the substitution as appropriate.  The scallops were well cooked, and found nestled within a mix of white beans, sausage, and a tomato base.  It was alright, however, forgettable.  I had to think about it now, even after having dined there just last night.  Too much wine, maybe, Tracy?  Is that what happened?  No. Not this time.    Seeing as I was there over this past holiday weekend, many menu items were unavailable on the holiday Monday, which is understandable.  Include was the lobster Cobb salad that had me all geared up to eat here.  All is forgiven, here, provided said salad delivers on my next visit."}
{"text":"Le Canard Mort just opened (soft launch) a week or so ago in Leslieville, so my mom, wife and I went to try it out this past Saturday.  Overall, we had a really wonderful experience.  -The decor is a bit bland and dark to my tastes, but the tables are well lit.  Granted the decor is still being finished (no bar shelving yet) so my comments may be slightly pre-mature. -Drinks. They offer prohibition-style cocktails at $11/drink.  They have over 140+ cocktails, including some interesting concoctions using elderflower and other less frequently used ingredients.  The bartender, Emily, (I believe) seems to know her stuff.  I described what I was looking for in a drink and she mixed me a fantastic cocktail!!  Definite worth checking-out if you're a cocktail fa -Food was tasty and reasonably priced.  We tried the spiced nuts to start and then shared 3 salads/mains: the nicoise salad (with smoked pickerel), the lobster cobb and the double-smoked pork chop.  We enjoyed all three salads/mains, but found the nuts unimpressive.  They weren't sufficiently crunchy or spicy!   Back to the mains.  The nicoise was well prepared with a poached egg and wonderfully smoky pickerel.  The Lobster Cobb was served with delicious pancetta and well-poached lobster.  I could taste a hit of butter on the lobster, which was perfect.  The pork chops were nice, tender and well-flavoured.  The smokiness came through nicely!  The resto is definitely still working out its kinks (broken beer fridge), but I was impressed with my first visit."}
{"text":"My bf and I stumbled across this restaurant. It looked nice on the outside but desperately needs an update inside. It felt a bit like the Keg. The menu was nice. We started with lobster bisque, which tasted like watered down fish soup. Our waiter was nice enough to take it back. We also had the Brussels sprout salad and crab cakes. These were very tasty. My bf had the cassoulet, it was mediocre. I had the lobster gnocchi, which was too salty for me. Overall, the service was good and the food was average. Nothing more than ur typical neighbourhood go to place."}
{"text":"Was here the other day - please come visit here for Brunch on Sundays...there's always a seat, and it's right beside Lady Marm!  it's so good here.  I tried the mushroom eggs benny - still love it (but I have an obsession with Paris, and generally most things French!)  Totally a neighbourhood gem, that seems to be way busier in the evening...  Mimosas are pretty cheap (I think it was $4 or $6), but you can only get them after 11am on the weekend."}
{"text":"You're lucky I had good company with me while I was dining here that makes it a 3 star experience altogether! Oh shoot, just that 2 star on Yelp's scale truly translate to how I felt - \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  You're out of cassoulet, duck and of coq au vin? Why did I come here?   Okay, I will be objective, the lobster bisque was delicious for something that is light and not so cream - based. The lobster meat seems generous, there were a few mushy pieces indicating that it's not fresh ... but over all I still enjoyed it.   Oh - my company brought up a good point, they didn't bother to bring or ask if we want bread on the side. When he did ask the waitress for some bread. She replied, \"I will ask the kitchen.\" We looked at each other not sure if we were asking for permission or if she wasn't sure if they have bread in the back?  Our main, we ended up with seafood papilotte. Nothing exciting at all. Two pieces of shrimp, single scallop (over cooked), salmon with some greens.  Key Lime pie was refreshing.   I thank my company for making it delightful.  Having dined at Ortolan and L'Ouvrier just the past week, I very much rather have had another meal there than here."}
{"text":"Had brunch on Sunday around noon, there was lots of seating and a line up at the restaurant next door (as per usual), so I was skeptical that it may not be good. But since I hate queuing for brunch or anything else for that matter I thought we'd give it a whirl.  I ordered the classic breakfast of bacon eggs and toast, $12.50.   The meal came quickly and I was totally impressed with the quality of food. It was fresh, delicious tasting, and void of any grease. The potatoes were amazing and again, they weren't greasy at all. The toast was made with a high quality grain bread, and included is a tasty dollop of salad.   Overall it was a perfect brunch."}
{"text":"I always excited to try new restaurants..especially if they are non Asians cuisine as I have enough share of Chinese restaurant reviews!!   Love the casual homey deco of Le Canard Mort. Even the kitchen is homey as it is quite small in size and have 2 chefs working. This maybe the reason why our orders took forever to come!!   The beer and cocktail selections here is awesome and priced reasonably!! My 2 Yelp Drinking Buddies each got their favourite beers... oh love the little pink elephant on the Delirum Tremens mug! My Elderflower Splitz, highly recommended by our friendly waitress was refreshing, a great summer drink!   Wait Wait Wait   Crisp Sweetbread ($11) finally arrived   Sweetbread looked and smell similar to buffalo chicken wings. (Before this meal, I am naive enough to think sweetbread is really sweet bread.... and I have to admit I have one of my numerous \"dumb/embrassing\" moment... blushing....) I found the hot sauce just a little overwhelming and the texture or the taste was just lost. It tasted like buffalo chicken wings   Wait Wait Wait   Lobster Cobb ($18) finally arrived   Lobster was cooked and seasoned well with a hint of buttery goodness, it also have good texture and not rubbery at all. but sadly I found it did not go well with the saltiness of Pancetta  nor the richness of blue cheese   We skipped dessert as I don't think I can Wait any longer..... and the food here is not worth the wait.   I might come back to Le Canard Mort for a drink but I might just pass on the food. I can't imagine I dine here on a Friday or a Saturday night instead of a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"The last time I was in this space it was a completely different restaurant and things weren't going well. When the waiter told us that certain items weren't on the menu because of (and I quote) \"some backed up sewage\" I took a personal oath to avoid this particular address on Queen street east.  Fortunately, that is ancient history and the team at Rossingol down the street has opened up another Gallic eatery named after a bird, albeit a dead one. Le Canard Mort is charming gastropub with moody lighting and capable, if somewhat casual, service.  They give equal footing to food and drink here and their cocktail menu is almost risably deep. It's more of an encyclopedia really, with drinks sorted by spirit, some bubbles, coffee cockails, \"odds and sods,\" and a wide beer selection too. It's five full pages of potent potables.  Though not nearly as long, their dinner menu is still enticing. I opted for a rilette board and their lobster cobb salad ($18). The charcuterie was a good portion, probably enough for 1.3 people. The salad however was enormous and was a mouthful of flavours: avocado, bleu cheese, sundried tomatoes, pancetta, and buttery lobster. Truly delicious.  Obligatory Title Pun: This DUCK is not lame.  Menu Readability: Lose the border and I'm sold. Sans-serif, clean, good leading.  Need to mention: I never knew this but there is a cocktail called the \"Toronto\" and it's made with Fernet(?).  What this place teaches me about myself: I can be won over with a three-page cocktail list."}
