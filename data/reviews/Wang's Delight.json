{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places in Phoenix! Been coming here for years and the food is always delicious. You have to try the Wang's Special Chicken. The chicken fried rice and the Hong Kong pan fried noodles are also really yummy. The service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Luv the Hong Kong pan fried noodles. They will cook using the whole dried red pepper if you like HEAT Management has changed,. Food greasy by time you get home Make them pack items you like crispy separate. You could BYOB but check first"}
{"text":"The food is very delicious , but this restaurant needs more than just \"one server\"!The owners are very nice and friendly and the food is very very good, but they just need more help when they are very busy ! My family and I are patient but there may be others who are limited on time and may get upset at waiting a  long time for refills and anything extra they may desire! Overall I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I stopped in because there used to be a Wang's by my house and I was curious to see if it is the same.   This Wang's is a inexpensive, quick Chinese restaurant. Not only is it inexpensive but lunch combo is plentiful (order with a side of rice, soup, won ton, and egg roll). I was in and out of the place pretty quickly and with a full stomach.  The reason why I gave it a three was the quality of the food. Not to say to owners don't know what they are doing back there. Instead, my mother and I found the food to be quite bland. Even blander than what you would expect at a buffet. I liked the flavor, it just needs to be multiplied. It kinda reminds me of the Chinese food yo would find at Epcot; food made to meet the masses. I wouldn't even mind if there was a price increase (it's only $5.50) or reduction in quantity if it meant a stronger taste.  I hope this Wang's is able to continue. I'm planning on giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery! This is my goto for Chinese food delivery. I love their food! My husband likes the orange chicken. Everything we've ordered has been great."}
{"text":"This was pretty gross. We ordered take out and everything tasted like it came directly from Panda Express. Two of the items we ordered tasted EXACTLY the same, even though they were entirely different dishes. We won't be returning. Keep Looking."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Finally  Chandler  gets a real chinese restaurant.The  mongolian beef, Kung Pao ,sweet and Sour Chicken, won ton soup were out of this world good! delivery was fast and the food was hot!  It's a must try for anyone looking for a good chinese in Arizona."}
{"text":"Quick service fresh food amazing orange chicken I come here whenever I get my taste for great Chinese!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual meal, or take-out.  The food is fantastic, service is fast, and it's priced fair.  My family and I love this place, and go on a regular basis!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had tried this place once before and it was gross. We decided to give it a second chance a year later and once again regret spending our money here. We ordered 3 lunch specials and the pork fried rice. The lunch specials servings barely passed as a serving, very disappointing. For $6.95 you could get better tasting food and a better deal at a Panda Express, and I despise Panda Express yet I'm recommending it over Wangs. The fried rice smelt burnt which was odd because the \"pork\" was not thoroughly cooked. It had a very odd taste to it, soapy. As though they did not rinse out all of the soap from their wok. I expected much more for $35 worth of food. I called and informed them of the pork not being fully cooked and they had a teenager as the middle man while the manager stood next to her telling her what to say, as though I couldn't hear them whispering to one another. They offered 10% off our next order, but $2 off another horrible meal? That's torture not an accommodation to a customer. Never again. Do yourself a favor and call the next closest Chinese restaurant for delivery. Don't choose these guys, you won't be happy with the results. The food is awful and their service just as bad. I was embarrassed for the teenaged girl... you might want a new job dear, your managers need some training in Customer Service."}
{"text":"This restaurant for a long time was my regular local Chinese place, well not anymore the meal that I just ate was the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten, lets start with all the details, flavorless, small portion, higher price, the supposed egg roll more like very small spring roll included was obviously store bought and was still frozen in the middle, and from my understanding wontons are supposed to have a filling but apparently not at Wang's. The last thing which is somewhat understandable is they charge you an extra 50 cents for the soup container when you get your lunch to go, so if you don't want the extra charge than no soup included. This extra charge isn't stated on the menu either.   So no more Wang's delight for me they just lost a longtime customer."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the last two years and it seems to be in decline.  When they first opened their food was always freshly prepared and tasted great.  These days it doesn't seem to be quite as fresh and is becoming more bland.  I typically order the sweet and sour chicken and the last two times I have ordered it. It  has come with next to no vegetables and literally two small cubes of pineapple. It's been disappointing to say the least. On a positive note the crab puffs are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went in with a girlfriend at 8:30 pm and they asked if we were dining in or taking out. We indicated that we wanted to dine in and they said, \"sorry, but we're trying to clean because we close in 30 minutes and our kitchen is closed.\"   I totally understand understand preparing to leave for the night, but businesses set aside time once the hours of operation are closed to do this, and they should modify their hours to 8:30 pm, instead of 9.   Disappointed. Won't return."}
{"text":"The food was very good and hot and I will order again but this establishment needs to update the prices they show on the website.  Their prices are anywhere from 50 cents to over $1.50 higher when you go to pick up your order.  I wanted brown rice instead of fried rice and was charged an additional dollar, even though I didn't get the fried rice.  Nickel and diming your customers can turn people off, especially when multiple orders are being placed."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! The yushang eggplant with pork is amazing and the kung pao two is great. I have never had a bad meal here! Great food and not inexpensive. Must try it! I have been eating here (the old location) for the past 20 years and this new location is just as good!"}
{"text":"Love it here! We have not had anything we didn't like...except my husband's pork egg roll that was disgusting! However the veggie rolls are great! Honey chicken, Orange chicken, orange beef all exceptionally amazing. I don't eat meat very often but this was so yum. The sesame chicken was good too. Not my fave but still good. I look forward to trying their veggie options once the new yr starts!! The beef fried rice is my fave so far, the pork fried rice was good. I liked that the meat was not chewy or fatty. The customer service is always on point! Overall great place. Great food!"}
{"text":"Remember Wang Computers? Wang Chung? Wang Dang Doodle? Wang Dang Sweet Poontang? And of course, that slang definition of wang :) ... Hmmm. Where was I going with this? Wang's Delight - so this is my neighborhood Chinese restaurant. The closest source of egg rolls and wontons in my aitch double o dee! So I decided to try them out a few times and wasn't overly impressed. Their best dish seems to be their \"Yu Shang Egg Plant\". They make that right - nice and buttery and not overly sweet or spicy - just the way I like it. Praise ends there, though. Every other dish I've tried is pretty much from the cornstarch and sugar school of American Chinese cooking (think Panda). Place itself is a small restaurant next to Filiberto's and AMF bowling lanes. Lotsa parking in that mall. The actual restaurant is pretty small and cozy. Never actually ate inside so I can't vouch for service. I usually pickup my orders and wait by what must have been a bar in whatever the previous incarnation of this business was. Now it's just a place to stack everything and anything - a real hot mess of clutter but it's amusing to observe what's on it in order to pass the time while waiting for my order. This place will probably not be a big contender for my Chinese food dollar as there are much better offerings just a block or two away."}
{"text":"This is our fourth time at Wang's delight, it never fails to sizzle our taste buds. The freshness, texture, taste, all of it is really well prepared, plated and thoroughly enjoyed every time. I believe they  make it with love. Their egg drop soup is fantastic, not just the ordinary kind you find everywhere else. Seems more authentic. AND THE PRICE!! The price is perfect in my opinion I truly love this place, we will be back weekly."}
{"text":"FINALLY, some good Chinese delivery food in AZ! My husband and I tried the general tso's chicken combo plates and they were fabulous. Large chunks of all white meat chicken, lightly fried, and with a perfect sauce that has a kick. We got veggies added in with no extra cost. The plates came with an egg roll, crab puff and fried rice. The rice and egg roll were good....not great...but did the job. I am super picky about crab rangoons and this one was awesome. Great cream cheese flavor with actual crab! No onions and a great cream cheese/dough balance. Slightly sweet. We are thrilled to have such a yummy Chinese restaurant right down the street...and they actually deliver. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Kung POW chicken is awesome and the Hot and Sour soup actually has some substance. Delivery is always fast too. I always like speaking with the pleasant people there as well. Great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Wang's last night for take out. Hubby order the Volcano Beef (spicy) and I took a safer route with the Orange Chicken. Since we ordered these as combos they each came with 1 crab puff and spring roll (though they called it an egg roll). We were not impressed with the overall flavor of the food. It really was a 2-star rating: \"meh\". Even though the bill came out to about 17 bucks I still felt like we could have used our money towards some more flavorful food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sub-par General tso combination. Too much sauce and the serving was kind of small. Also no utensils, or sauce"}
{"text":"Orange chicken and sweet and sour pork were very mediocre. Basil Chicken was unique and delicious. Chicken fried rice was gross. We mentioned the fried rice to the server and she said, \"oh\" and then walked away as quickly as possible. There are too many other better places around here to come back."}
{"text":"Best and most flavorable Chinese food I have had. I have eaten here more than 30 times in the last 5 years"}
{"text":"The name is as good as the food. You can go in and take out, you can sit down and get served, and if your close enough they will deliver. It a mom and pop Asian food place with all or your favorite taste liker teriyaki and orange chicken! worth a stop and food is always great!"}
{"text":"This place is FABULOUS.  Cheap prices especially for lunch and always good food."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Git the orange chicken combo dinner. Just the right amount if food"}
{"text":"I love this local place.  Great food and atmosphere.  Friendliest folks in town.  Locally owned too.  Just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I really disagree with the saying that this place is the same as Panda Express, that place is gross. While the place is not better than say, China Way, it is still pretty decent for Americanized Chinese food. The lo mein was pretty decent and she brought us all of our dishes complete with all of the sauces; sweet and sour, hot mustard. (see photos.)  The portions were pretty big and if you don't think so, the other counties are right, we Americans do not know about portion control. My partner received the Mongolian beef which looked pretty decent and was declared as such, I don't know I don't eat meat so I couldn't tell you.   Everything arrived piping hot and it took a little while as they were making everything to order. I did not experience the blandness that the others speak of as everything was well seasoned and the sauces were very flavorful. I thought with a name like Wang's this place has got to be bad, but it turned out to be not so bad."}
{"text":"We have gone to Wang's Delight a few times now.  I am not aware of its previous location, and only know of this place due to its proximity.  Unfortunately, there is better Chinese food within a few blocks of this restaurant.  Namely, the four corners of Warner and Dobson, in the Lee Lee Supermarket shopping complex is quite a bit better.  In the beginning, Wang's contained some great food, and the food tasted fresh, well-prepared.  Each time we've gone, though, the food seems to have become more bland.  The last time, the food tasted almost as though it had been pre-prepared, perhaps even frozen and then reheated or recooked.    The restaurant was empty at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  It was very quiet.  We were shown our table quickly, and our orders were taken quickly as well.  We had General Tso's chicken, Orange Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and a stir fry dish.  Overall, the food was bland and didn't taste fresh at all.  Service was rapid and friendly, and the restaurant was very clean.   I think if you're looking for general American-Chinese fare, a lot of food, at a decent price, then it's okay.  I emphasize though that there are much better choices around."}
{"text":"I love this place & am a regular. Food always comes hot & cooked well. The hot & sour soup is my favorite &  can be made extra spicy to your tastes. I usually order the kung pao chicken which has alot of sauce to it & combines with the rice quite nicely. Only issue I've had is that the crab puffs have a habit of being over fried.  Overall all excellent place for a delivery night."}
{"text":"The place was very small, with a cold feeling, The service was not good either, We ordered our food and about 3 other table of guest came in after us got thier food before us, and of course they left before us also, not sure why. They didn't seem to have enough help. The food was your normal Asian food, nothing special or that stood out. The fried rice on the lunch plate was just white rice with soy sauce, nothing else added. Prices were ok. $5-$8ish. I'm not going back because I wasn't happy with my experience at all. I give them a negative star!"}
{"text":"Very clean, remodeled restaurant with pleasant staff and quality food.  The General Tao Chicken was very fresh.  Mongolian Beef was a little salty for my tastes, but still nice quality of food and nice portions."}
{"text":"Took a chance, & I'm glad we did ! Great food, quick service & affordable prices. We tried the beef & broccoli $8.99 , teriyaki chicken $7.99 & a small bowl of egg drop soup $3.99. The small size of the soup could have served 2 people easily ! But... I hogged the whole bowl . I can't wait  to come back and try the hot & sour soup ."}
{"text":"Not sure why it has low reviews, but we had a wonderful experience. The food was top quality and was very flavorful?the staff was friendly and it was decently clean. I would recommend the honey shrimp. It's close to a Peking shrimp other places."}
{"text":"I had been to the old Wang's so when I saw it had reopened I had to check it out... I went witl my friend for lunch we were seated the staff were really friendly I just ordered a water it seemed to taste weird. I looked over the menu and ordered the Volcano Beef and my friend ordered the General Tso's Chicken each came with rice and a spring roll and a bowl of hot and sour soup... The soup was really good I liked my meal but the spring roll was just ok and I tried my friends General Tso's Chicken was really soggy and not crispy... I was hoping for some blow my mind Chinese food it was good but not 5 star good."}
{"text":"Started off with the lunch special  Orange Chicken: excellent, cooked in the sauce, not those hard fried balls with orange sauce on it  Curry chicken: well flavored Kung Pao Chicken: excellent again, not too many peanuts  Mongolian beef: again excellent.  Best Chinese food I've had in a while. Not some run of the mill fry everything and"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  I have been a loyal customer for years and the food is always delicious.  I especially love the crab puffs! They always use white meat in their dishes. Plus,  their lunch specials are an amazing deal... $5.95 which includes an entree,  soup, egg roll, and fried rice. It's not fancy,  but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, let's just get this out of the way:   Wang's Delight ... The \"Pervy 14-year-old boy\" part of my personality is busting up laughing right now!   *Responsible, functional adult part chimes in*  \"Sheesus, Meg, act your age already!\"  Anyway, the food here. Unimpressed! Especially since a few of my coworkers used to go here often, enjoyed it and highly recommended it.   Found their menu in a drawer one night. I wasn't going to cook, Dude was working late, Chinese it is! *Ahem, swear I'm more domestic than takeout ...*  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Chicken Lo Mein. After tip I think this averaged out to be a little over $15.   Both dishes were overly oily, mushy and lacking any kind of spice or character. Kind of like those microwaveable Tai Pei Asian food meals (or whatever the name is) I would scarf down in college.   Not so sure I'm going to rush back and try them again.  Sorry Wang's, I  just wasn't delighted with your cuisine."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast delivery! I have been trying to find a good Chinese place in town let alone one that delivers. The cashew chicken is actually loaded with chicken!! And the specialty house fried rice has full size chicken and shrimp.   Must try!"}
{"text":"Average tasting dinner. Service and prices were good. Next time I will choose Pf Changs."}
{"text":"This is a very good Chinese Restaurant.  Their Hot and Sour Soup is very flavorful - one of the best that I have eaten in the Valley.  Lots of meats, tofu, Shrimp and scallions on top.  I have ordered the Kung Pao and always ask them to make it extra spicey.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Another place so Americanized it ruined the experience.  Below average food and average prices means I will not recommend this place to anyone and I will not be back.  On to the next Chinese place soon"}
{"text":"Worst food ever had in a Chinese restaurant, also the staff is too rude.. place were empty...."}
{"text":"Today was a grab and go lunch as I was hustling in between meetings to get things done. I'm always about supporting local businesses and when u have a lunch special I'm typically game.   Decided to get the General Tso's lunch special to go with egg drop soup. I frequent a few other spots for the same thing and the portions are nice... I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality of food when I arrived to my destination. Small portions but decent."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out from Wang's the other night.  The price was reasonable, the service was prompt.   Ordered three distinct dishes: General Tsao Chicken, Orange Beef and Honey Beef. All where very bready and honestly pretty much tasted the same. If your looking for super Americanized Chinese this might be your place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for some good chinese food and decided on wangs. We order 3 entrees and vegetable rolls. This food is absolutely awful. The beef was rubber, the orange chicken was grade d with no flavor and the spring rolls were mush . I was looking for authentic chinese food and I got frozen microwave. Panda express tastes better, and I don't eat there either. All I can say is who ever is giving this food 4 and 5 star ratings needs their taste buds examined."}
{"text":"Wow!  Here we were on Christmas night, we just saw a movie at the Chandler mall and needed a Chinese place to eat dinner at and Wang's was one of the few that came up that was open with great reviews on the Yelp app. We hurried over and got one of the last tables.   Now, I have to say the customer service was awful, but I have a feeling it was just because it was Christmas night and they were operating on a skeleton staff. We waited quite a while to order and even longer for our food, but when it arrived it was sweet ambrosia. I had the special of the night: happy family spicy style and it was amazing. I honestly don't think I've had Chinese food this good in years. My youngest son had chow mein with shrimp and it had the biggest shrimp in it and tons of fresh veggies I was happy to take off his hands. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we are already planning on coming back."}
{"text":"When our usual lunch spot on Ray Rd. in Chandler was packed, my wife and I decided to branch out and look for an alternative. In a strip mall slightly off the beaten path, we stumbled upon Wang's Delight. For the most part, it was a delight.  The restaurant was not very busy, so the service was excellent. And people who run the place were as friendly as it gets.  We both liked our dishes. My wife ordered garlic chicken and gave it a thumb's up. Being a vegetarian, I ordered a spicy vegetable and tofu dish. It was good, too, and the spiciness level was just right for me, as long as I didn't accidentally bite into one of the small red chili peppers. We both liked our egg-drop soup.  I don't think the restaurant caters to the health-conscious crowd. White rice was the only option, and the sauce used in both dishes was on the salty side. That always makes me wary at a Chinese restaurant.  We both liked the fortunes in our fortune cookies, which is an important measure of any Chinese restaurant. My wife's fortune wisely said that even smart people should listen to stupid people. That's spot on because she is smart and in a job where she deals with a fair number of stupid people. Great advice.  The restaurant's décor was interesting. Behind the counter were tiles that had been sculpted into a wavy pattern to form a ceiling-high frame for what apparently was intended to be the focal point of the room: a small framed picture of goldfish. Also, it appeared they were running out of storage or had just received a new shipment of something because boxes were stacked along one wall in the dining area. It didn't bother us. Just interesting.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and we intend to add this restaurant to our rotating list of lunch places."}
{"text":"No the Kung Pao chicken is not awesome (colon ,open bracket). This is the staple americanized chinese cuisine with one base sauce ( soy,sugar,rice vinegar, garlic) and just simple deviations to obtain the various dishes.   You will get the same stuff at Panda express or any other generic americanized chinese eatery. Base your need to visit on the price differential if you want.  I also enquired about some of the dishes in order to acertain any hidden \"special\" (read authentic) dishes, but was sadly dissapointed.  Extra star(as ususal) for Mom-Pop eatery."}
{"text":"Their general chaos chicken isn't that flavorful. I wouldn't order here unless you have no other choice I mean its cr*zy how bland food can be. The only thing that gave this place a 2 star review was the on time delivery.... maybe because we were the only delivery order placed that night."}
{"text":"WD is a small strip mall Chinese place the I went to on a coworkers suggestion. I did a pick up so I saw the place, it was moderately busy and a little dimly lit for my preference. But what it lacks in decor it makes up in price.  You get your bang for your buck here. The lunch special is especially good for the frugal lunch crowd. The taste is also solid. It's a good little spot to grab a quick cheap bite to eat when you're sick of fast food or other lunch options without breaking the bank. Don't expect some crazy fancy meal, but I also didn't find myself sick or anything which is often the case if the food is overly greasy.  I'd return again to scratch that craving. Keep in mind that they are actually cooking the food so if you are in more of a rush consider calling ahead and doing a pick up."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese restaurant.  The staff is friendly and I love to go there!"}
{"text":"My husband noticed this place while he was out running an errand and decided to pick up some food for a late lunch for the two of us since I had already told him that I was in no mood to cook that day.  We had the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special and the Combo Lo Mein.  We both liked the food but I was disappointed to see that we are outside of their delivery area even though they are less than 3 miles away.   I agree with the other reviewers that the food was a little bland.  The Kung Pao was not nearly spicy enough for me but my husband enjoyed it.  I know people make fun of Pei Wei as not being authentic but at least that place has some flavor to it!  I did enjoy the Lo Mein noodles; they were not as greasy as some other places and had a lot of veggies mixed in.  The broccoli and snap peas were still crisp, not soggy and overcooked so that was a big plus.  I agree with the other reviewers that this place seems more healthy than other Chinese places.  I wish they would pass a law to require all restaurants to post their calorie info (hey, the chains already do it) so that we could really know for sure.  I think the lunch combo is a great value so I may pop in there for lunch some time.  Or maybe we will give them a call and see if they are willing to go the extra 2 blocks for delivery."}
