{"text":"Although still alittle pricey for what you get,(kind of like a Ruth Chris Burger joint..each item costs about $5-7, regardless) ALOT better quality than Burger 21, esp. for the price.  I may go back but one thing that i've never seen anywhere else, they ask you for a TIP at the cash register BEFORE you get your order.  Leaving aside where this TIP actually ends up, not only is a place that doesn't normally charge TIPs, asking for them, but who would pay for a TIP in advance?"}
{"text":"Really poor customer service. Got our order wrong and then instead of fixing it, wanted us to get back in line to reorder. Once the food arrived the buns were stale and the fries old. Too bad because this used to be our go-to good burger place."}
{"text":"This used to be the old BT Burgers location, of which we were regulars for more than a year and enjoyed.  The new owners, not so much.
 We had been looking forward to an American Burger opening nearer to us, after seeing how well they did nearer downtown Charlotte and at SouthPark.  However, this one is a BIG disappointment.
 We started with our usual Friend Pickles.  Now, I know in some areas this is supposed to be \"finger food\", but really guys, serving them ultra hot right out of the deep fry without plates and utensils?  I had to ask to a couple small plates for the table, and then had to get up and fetch my own flatware.  It's like the guy bringing out our food couldn't comprehend we didn't want to suffer 2nd degree burns handling freshly fried pickles.
 As for the burgers themselves, it was obvious they were hand formed, but just barely so.  They tended to crumble apart in the bun, turning into more of a \"lose meat\" sandwich than a \"burger\" which usually has some adhesion if properly crusted on the outside.  The flavor was OK, but the consistency was a bit of a turn-off.  The buns weren't that great either.
 With a Bad Daddies Burger going up across the street in another month or so, I doubt this place will survive long."}
{"text":"Burger itself was good, the pretzel bun was meh. I have to say, I'm not super impressed. Everything was pretty mediocre. It's very family friendly and as everyone knows I LOVE THAT. 

The food for my table was all good,  and correct. The place was clean and the employees were nice. I'm not saying your going to have terrible food but around here there are so many better spots to go that this one was simply outshined. 

It happens... I would try it again to give it another shot but I surely wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"This place used to be better but I had a terrible service experience there today. 

No leaf lettuce for my wife's lettuce bun. They used to do this and the guy who was taking our order understood that's what she was asking for. Didn't find out they don't do lettuce buns anymore until they brought her a burger on a pile of shredded lettuce.

My son can't have the ice cream they give with the kids meal so we asked about maybe doing a couple lug nuts, cinnamon donut holes, instead. This super reasonable request was met with a firm \"No!\" from the jackass manager.

Whoever this guy is, he's running this place down. No clue about how to properly handle customers. Used to be a regular but now I'm not going back.

Can't wait for Bad Daddy's to open at Waverly!"}
{"text":"Burger wasn't the best got it for free today. However the chicken club was really good"}
{"text":"It's a solid decent good burger, good sweet potato fries. Loved the old Sauce they had for it with the honey cinnamon. Customer service was fine at 3 on a weekday."}
{"text":"You know how you get to a point, where you say no mas, toward a type of food?  Well, we hit that AFTER, this jaunt to American.  That said it was awesome burgers!  But we're burgered out for a while .  You can take that as a compliment American!!
We ordered the classic and route 66 with onion rings and fries respectively and it was shark eyes all around (5/5). Hot and fresh tasting! 
The service is consistent at this location and the staff is friendly and the interior is clean (5/5).
Give this place a try...It's worth it!"}
{"text":"SADLY, this location of AB has closed.  After morphing from BT Burgers AB seemed to be evolving, then there appeared to be a staff change followed quickly by closure? 

Nice folks, great burgers cooked to order are no more.

They are missed as there are no similar \"craft\" burgers in the hood."}
{"text":"We arrived at ABC around 8:40 on a Monday. We come here often on Mondays. The place was empty. The staff was cleaning. We immediately felt the coldness. We placed our order. The lady in charge loudly told the cashier to give us take out cups. He said, you do know that we close at 9, right?! There was no customer service tonight. The food redeemed this review from 1 star to 3 stars. We ate at the sound of metal chairs being put on top of the tables. They should learn to use a poker face."}
{"text":"Not sure why the low ratings-always had good service here and fresh food. Ohhh-now I see it is price complaints-this is not a fast food hamburger joint! Relatively the same prices you pay at: Pinky's, Burger 21, Big Daddy's, Fudruckers, and specialty food trucks around Noda. 

Nice outside sitting area, plenty of parking, both car and bike. 

Great turkey burger, veggie burger, tots and onion rings."}
