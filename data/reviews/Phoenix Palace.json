{"text":"Love the cleanliness , service and variety they cater for Dim Sum. So far the best dim sum I've tried in Phoenix. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I always get the dim sum to go. There food is good. And friendly service. Almost everything we get is pretty good and there pricing is great. Shu mai is yummy."}
{"text":"this morning's menu - dim sum & tea time...what a find!  how would i describe my experience?  a simple pleasure...good company, great conversation, and delicious, healthy dishes.  fresh steamed dishes brought to you on carts that tantalize visually and kick start your appetite till you're at capacity.  come hungry, leave satisfied without guilt. my first time there to meet new friends - our party size of 4, was a spontaneous choice, initial thought to grab a coffee, but decided to have dim sum & steaming jasmine tea, an excellent pivot!  we arrived shortly after 10a when dim sum usually starts and left about 1:30p.  selections sampled included pork su mai, shrimp dumplings, chinese broccoli topped with oyster sauce, bean curd pork & shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, baked hot dog roll (dim sum style, not american), shrimp chow fun, and two desserts - baked coconut roll and egg custard pastry for dessert.  all this for under $10 per person!  our waiter was a young man who was very personable, attentive to our needs, the food so amazing, the price very reasonable.  what's cool is you dont have to speak chinese (mandarin or cantonese), just point to the dish you desire!  will return very soon, and often.  bucket list item.  it's 5-stars all the way! top3 reasons why... 1- totally delicious, healthy authentic dishes 2- excellent value 3- atmosphere (reminds me of sf china town dim sum - buzzing conversations, authentic, clean, location, great service eg quick, courteous)"}
{"text":"I go to Phoenix Palace almost every Sunday, and generally I like the place, it serves great Dim Sum. Except, today I ordered the Shark Fin Shu Mai and right when I put it in my mouth, it was extremely sour. I order that dish many times and it has yet been sour. I knew that the food has gone bad. The waiter gave me a refund, but I am still disgusted by the thought of serving customers inedible foods. From earlier today, I have gotten food poisoning and have not been able to eat so thank you."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! A young man named Rui was my server and was very helpful at helping me pick out a few great things to order.  I definitely? recommend? checking this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"WOW!!...This was the first time I tried Dim Sum in Phx and i was really surprised to find something really good. 
The place looks small from the outside but its a good size dim sum place. The service was fast and good...they came around the carts frequently. We mostly had the shrimp stuff and it was EXCELLENT!
Great find and cheap...we both had a good amount until we were full and the bill came to $16!!!"}
{"text":"Who still uses MSG in this day and age?! Phoenix Palace does! I asked for no MSG and she said, \"I will let the chef know\". She might have just been honest and told me that it is in everything. I had a migraine that lasted for three days after eating here. I will never come back. The veggies were fresh. That's the only good thing I can say. My dish was very bland. Certainly not worth the migraine."}
{"text":"Only come here for Dim Sum for sit it.  Food was OK/good.  Should only come during weekends...not too many options come out during the week (don't blame them...not a consistent flow of customers).  The dim sum was good, but think it won't get better than this in AZ.  Had better in higher asian area/community (CA/WA).  Service is on the slower side, but wasn't expecting more from them.  Take out is not too much better, but convenient for busier days.  Person behind the counter don't seem like they want to work there...but who does.  Best place in east valley for Dim Sum, but only in AZ."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place but the dishes are awesome! Service is great, too."}
{"text":"I enjoy the dim sum it's great, really. When I come with my Asian friends or my Asian side of family I have no problem. I receive food before I sit down and drinks. 

When I come with my family who isn't Asian or my white friends. I could forget about being served. They ignore us half the time. And I had 6 people sitting and they only gave us 3 drinks.... Yah. If you come bring someone Asian.

Not to be racist.. But it is true."}
{"text":"Awoke this working with a powerful hunger for dim sum while visiting some friends here in Phoenix. Hopped on Yelp to see what was in the area and stumbled across this gem. I have been traveling for the past few months and have not had the opportunity to enjoy good dim sum since I left Portland, but with some solid reviews we headed out into the sun to see what Phoenix Buffet had to offer.

Let me start by saying that chicken feet and turnip cake are the barometer by which I generally gauge dim sum quality, and the presence of carts during a weekday lunch was a promising sign. With chop sticks in hand, we ordered a bevy of dishes and set upon them. The chicken feet were excellent! Turnip cake had good flavor, though I usually expect more of a crust. Everything else we tried was equally flavorful, authentic and fresh. 

I highly recommend this location if you should happen to find yourself in a similar din sum craving predicament.

Cheers ya'll!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad - their egg tarts are really good and their food is fresh only if you get in right before the rush. But the reason for the low rating is that I'm pretty peeved/annoyed at the service I was given today. I even brought in new friends to try out the place and give them more business. Many times  I had to get up and ask for the things we wanted- like water, chili oil, we were pretty much ignored (and I get that, there's some prejudice when you have non-asians -its harder for the servers to communicate with each other). The worst was when I had to walk up to get the bill, get the bill, then return to pay for it. We had 4 cards to pay that was going to end up being over $50 (plus tip), and at first they wouldn't accept our payment. I have never before been refused this request when I was here a month ago. I get that they're annoyed with paying the extra merchant fee, but honestly it's only a few extra cents and it's not like we would each only be paying $5-10 on our card. Plus, it's not that they're dying and going out of business, nor did they have a sign saying this was not allowed. I went up to the manager and he just grabbed the cards in my hands while rolling his eyes at me. After I got our receipts back, I found out that he overcharged each of us by a few dollars, without letting me know... I ended up tipping less than I normally do because I'm pretty annoyed at this kind of service. I don't mind paying more to use my credit card, but all you have to do is treat your customers with an explanation. I also run a business and understand that costs are costs, but don't be cheap about it when you have about 100 other customers in the restaurant, making it look like you're making quite the profit running up other people's credit cards."}
{"text":"Phoenix palace is always busy in the morning for dim sum. The waiters/waitresses that push the carts always forget to come to my table. The dim sum is alright. I've had better."}
{"text":"This place is good. Large selection of plates, and my usual favorites also. Went with the family.  It was nice. Not that you'd write home about it, but service was good, the food was good and not as much sodium as some other places.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum In Town!!

I like the wide selections of dim sum they have. You can also tell they made most the dim sums freshly, not those bought frozen type of deal like some other places. 

Sometimes, I would be surprised with new products/ unusual products they are serving. Last time I was there, I was offered \"thousand years old egg cake\". But, if you keep open mind, this is the best place for you to sample many different type of dishes affordably. . 

Can't wait to bring some new friends there for some Dim Sum this weekend!"}
{"text":"First of all, if you are going to have dim sum, go early during the weekend because that is when the quality and freshness are best. Also go in a large group so that the bill is less for everyone. I have been here a few times on Sunday mornings around 10 am and never have to worry about waiting for a table. They have a decent selection of dim sum dished. My usual's are the \"footballs\", the Hau gau, and the taro cakes, all of which are decent. If you wait long enough, you might be able to get your hands on the coconut pastries called \"snow balls\" which are very enjoyable. In a hungry group of 4, you can expect to pay $20-25 total as a group and not want to eat anything for the next 6-12 hours."}
{"text":"The food is always as expected but the service has gone absolutely downhill from ok.... to \"did they just put our chopsticks and napkins on the table while it was soaking wet from what appeared to be a stinky dish rag they wiped it with?\"  We decided to try it again and used the private room in the back for a reserved party.... it was filthy.  When brought to the manager's attention,  he was not even apologetic and looked angry at us! The customers for suggesting that it be cleaned up before our guests arrive.  I think I'm done with the place.... at least for awhile unless some things change."}
{"text":"Hands down best dim sum in the Valley. I've taken different groups of friends here on EVERY Sunday in the past two months, skipping only Easter, and have eaten like it's my last meal on Earth every time. All of my friends including Alex loved it and agree that it's the best dim sum in town right now. It's totally worth it even with the long drive from North Scottsdale and ridiculous weekend highway closures. Looks like I might be there again next Sunday..."}
{"text":"This is not a buffet.

I went in on a Tuesday 7 PM. The place was dead.

I got the hot and sour soup which was pretty good.
5.95. Pretty good portion. Split between 3 people.

XO sauce spicy fried rice...
NOT spicy at all. Very bland.
Probably won't get that again.

Assorted veggies plate with rice...
it was okay.
Wasn't the best I ever had but not bad either.

Service was kind of slow, as it took a while to get seated when there was nobody else in the restaurant,
and longer than I would like for them to take my order.

You have to ask for ice waters if you want it otherwise they won't give it to you.
You only get tea :p

They pour your tea for you and serve your soup for you which is kind of nice.

But the food... nothing too special to drive a long way for.

Overall, I don't think I will go again, but I guess its a good place to get to go stuff if you're into that.

I also noticed they do dim sum till 3 PM."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been at this place in and service and food are horrible nobody can speak English service is - 10 on horrible scale!!"}
{"text":"This place is 3.5 star for me now! The food is better than what I had last time.
You can't beat the freshness of the seafood :)."}
{"text":"For Arizona, this is one the best place! Yes, there are other places in the world that have better dim sum, but for Phoenix, AZ this is one of the best. It can be crowded over the weekends, but there is a high turn over of that it speeds up the wait time. The food is delicious and there is a good variety and dessert assortments."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dim sum restaurant in the valley. If you come on a Sunday during prime time you'll get the freshest food, largest selection, and best service. There are carts being wheeled nonstop between the tables. It makes for a fun outing with family and friends. If you're adventurous, you may want to try authentic dishes like chicken feet. If not, there are plenty of dumpling and noodle options, and sweets too. It's not as robust as dim sum in San Francisco Chinatown but it fully satisfies my craving for dim sum. Just don't show up after 2pm because you'll only have 'leftovers' to choose from - they stop adding to the carts once the crowd dies off."}
{"text":"One of the 3 best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix
1. Phoenix Palace  2. Great Wall 3. Golden Buddha
Try the crabs, live fish, lobsters and Geoducks.

Geoducks are ususally offered during winter time."}
{"text":"After previously having been disappointed by C-Fu Gourmet on a previous weekday, came here instead. Staff were very pleasant, and the place is a bit older, but while they had dim sum and they do speak Cantonese here, was served what appeared to be leftover dim sum from the weekend: not tolerable and may have had some distress afterwards as a result. Everything appeared to be previously frozen or factory made, not fresh. The search for decent dim sum goes on, or I will head west to the San Gabriel Valley on the weekends."}
{"text":"My mom came from Guangzhou China, she likes dim sum a lot, it's the nearest place we can have dim sum in Chandler. We went this restaurant many times, our favorite items tested not the same each time, sometime good, sometime test not as good as we expected. They have a great potential of improvement."}
{"text":"Bad food, waitress had a bad attitude and the won Ton soup was watery, stay away you might sick from eating here"}
{"text":"Best place for dim sum in Chandler! - from me,  a person grew up eating dim sum every week in Guangzhou. This is where we train our kids on dim sum names and develop their love for Chinese cuisine. Now that the other comparable place, china king, is closed, this is the ONLY place we go."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had for a long time!!!!  The service was awesome and the duck...please try the duck, it is life affirming.  In short, skip Panda Express and hit up this place, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  My best friend recommended it, she comes here every Sunday for dim sum brunch.  Service was fast, the carts came by every so often and almost everything we had was delicious - sticky rice, shrimp balls, shu-mai, pork buns, spare ribs and roast duck!  And best of all?  We paid only over $25+  for so much food!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Ted L. for posting the picture of the rude guy in your review dated 5-29-2016.  I can now confirm that guy was also rude to me during my recent visit.

I am fairly certain that guy is actually the owner or co-owner of the restaurant.  He has never been too friendly before, but now he turned rude.  

I can understand/tolerate an occasional rough behavior from an underpaid/overloaded employee (incidentally this also happened at Phoenix Palace sometime ago), but for an owner to be rude to his customers is totally unacceptable.  No one should feel being insulted or harassed while patronizing a small business."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is Horrible, had to wait 20 min just for someone to tell that we needed to order and that's after my girlfriend waved someone down like an SOS on the freeway, I never got a refill at all on my iced tea!!
Will never go there again!!"}
{"text":"In Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area, this place is as good as it gets for dimsum. Coming from southern CA with delicious dimsum, I would say the choices here are decent, the table arrangements are pretty comfortable, and the setting is friendly and full of families. It's a great place for an outing or a casual event and just sipping tea (we ordered the Chrysanthemum Tea with flowers).

Actually, the best thing about this restaurant is the price. It's affordable. I came with 6 people total and we ate our hearts out. The price came out to be no more than $11 including tip per person. 

Only tidbit is I enjoy flavored food, and the food here is a little more bland than I prefer. Request some yellow mustard and chili spices to dip your dishes in and flavor up your food!"}
{"text":"This is where we get our dim sum fix. Staff are nice and the place looks semi cleaner. I think they renovated the restaurant. We always order chow mein for my kids in which they absolutely love as well as the pineapple bun. My husband and I usually order the shumai, calamari (my favorite), tofu, seafood egg rolls and other yummy dim sum that my husband orders which I don't know the names. Overall, good food :)"}
{"text":"New favorite dim sum in Phoenix area!!  We even went back at night and had meals off the menu and it was very good as well.  The place is always busy and service is good. Prices are great, too."}
{"text":"My wife has a theory that if a restaurant is crowded, the fare is good and obviously the opposite scenario applies. I've tried explain that this doesn't always ap ally in the States. 

It does here however. The four star rating is for the dim sum which ranks among the best in the city and draws a huge crowd. We went for dinner recently and found the restaurant deserted sans for the employees and the food was downright horrible. Two dishes were over cooked, all were under-seasoned, and the ingredients weren't fresh. 

I highly recommend the dim sum; go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"It is my first time at here. Service is good. There have food I like. I would to come back again. Yummy ."}
{"text":"The food is good and multiple. You have a lot of options!! We always enjoy the dim sum in the beautiful weekend!"}
{"text":"My hometown is in Canton, China, and the dim sum here really reminds me of the flavor I miss. I have been here almost every month since I knew this place, and usually I order the chicken feet, pork ribs, Gai Lan, the beef meat balls, ??, and other things, and they all taste yummy."}
{"text":"It's the best Chinese food I can find in Phoenix area and I am a Chinese. This place is no longer a buffet restaurant. I love their services, very considerate and kind, feel like family. And the dishes taste authentic Cantonese style. If you like Dim Sum, it's so delicious and so cheap! Definitely you should try."}
{"text":"Was looking for a dim sum place in AZ and this was it. 20 miles from Phoenix but worth the visit. It has all the usual dim sum treats and also sells barbecue pork and duck to go. Be sure to be seated in the large main dining room as we were seated in a rear banquet room and it was hard to get the attention of the servers and their rolling carts. Yes get there early or expect a wait at peak brunch on weekends. Service was good and prices reasonable. Bring friends so you can try more things.  There is also the LeeLee Chinese Market in the same shopping mall and worth a visit on its own."}
{"text":"I have been here for dim sum couple times, good service and good food. BUT.. a recent visit to Phoenix Palace gave me a brand new view about this place. My friend and I had 2 waters and 6 dim sum items. When the bill came, we noticed an item on the bill says \"2 guests: $1.70\". When we asked the server why, she replied \"we charge money for water.\"  This restaurant CHARGES $0.85 for every water they give out to customer! This is not bottle water, simply water from the tap in a plastic cup. For this reason, I will NOT return to this place, there are plenty other dim sum places in town will gladly provide free water to customers, like any other restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"Good food, pretty cheap but when I went...I had to hunt down what I wanted and it wasn't always available.  It's fun to share/sample different items but nothing outstanding.  I would go again but this time with better expectations."}
{"text":"BEWARE CUSTOMERS when going to this shady Chinese Restaurant during DIM SUM hours. So we went to lunch today. 3 adults and one child-18 months old. When the final bill came I noticed 4 GUEST $2.63 charged onto my bill. I asked what this was for since we didn't order any hot tea. The cashier said that it's a SERVICE FEE we all have to pay for this she said. I said for what? The FEE goes towards SAUCES you use on the table, Cleaning table clothes-we have to pay to have them washed she said and towards cleaning of the kitchen as well as amongst other things. I told her that it was bull crap. That's wrong. I told her I'm from the East Coast and no where do they do this in NY, Boston, Chicago or San Francisco Chinatown. Then she said the sign is here listed that we can add the fee to your bill. That sign was posted at the register after you have already paid. That's ENTRAPMENT!!! I will never go back. By the way my baby who was 18 months old had  to pay that service fee. He didn't even eat or drink anything from that place."}
{"text":"My parents came into town and insisted on having Chinese food, but I told them that I didn't think there would be any authentic Chinese food in the middle of a desert. Well...

After stopping by the Lee Lee supermarket next door (uber Asian!) my parents and I wandered into this place, unsure of what it would hold... and lo and behold! Dim sum? Cantonese speaking servers? 

I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic this place was, with the push-around carts and the loud boss running around poking fun at his employees. Everything about this place made me feel like I was back home in NY eating in Chinatown... 

CONS: I got a little stomach ache from the 'lo mai gai' or rice wrapped in lotus leaf and unfortunately suffered from that for the rest of the day. I also think the seafood could have been fresher... Also, not too many choices but then again, if there's only a few authentic Chinese restaurants in the area, I won't complain if it's the run-of-the-mill dishes...

PROS: The 'dan tat' or egg tart is pretty good, though I do prefer my crust to be a little more moist."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Had 2 meals delivered, this was horrible. Both dishes. They should be paying me.  I ordered delivery and due to the minumum was required to spend a certain dollar amount, no problem, ordered two entrees, figured I'd have the other the next day.  The food delivered was as if it had been sitting in a bin for many hours as everything came dried out, cold and no flavor.  the sweet and sour shrimp didn't even have the sweet and sour sauce.  they gave these little to go packets of hot sauce and duck sauce.  First and last time I eat from this place.  I can't find away to take away the one star I've given this place.  Oh well"}
{"text":"Amazing Dim sum and an awesome experience all around. Do yourself a favor and try everything. You never know what may become your new favorite item."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday for the first time, as were heard the Dim Sum is very good, and I as was surprise it was one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale!!! For you first timers, there are no directions once you are seated, the nice ladies come around to your table with their carts and they tell you ( the best they can) what they are serving. Once you say yes, they put their mark on the ticket. I would have liked more veg and noodle dishes, but was unaware until after we were finished eating that you can order different foods directly from the kitchen!!! The food was great, service was really good, great family experience, affordable, and plenty of parking- BUT come early on Sundays it gets CROWDED!!! This place is a gotta try!!!TS"}
{"text":"Coming from the Chicago area my family loved \"The Phoenix\". We came here looking to supplement our Dim Sum needs and were pleased. This place had everything we were looking for and more. I would consider this place to be fantastic considering they had opened at 10 and were packed by 10:30. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rather decent menu.

They have some authentic Chinese dishes, ask for the Chinese menu.

I bring out-of-state friends to eat dim sum here, and the general consensus is the food is quite good. 

I recommend this restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"Good. Fast. Cheap. Weekends are crowded. They have soup dumplings (think Asian ravioli stuffed with pork/shrimp/veggies and broth). Tasty but not like home....nyc chinatown spoiled me."}
{"text":"Once one of my colleagues learned that I had never tried Dim Sum, they immediately dragged me to this place for lunch.  While it is a buffet, I was informed that they block up a part of the seating for Dim Sum at lunchtime.

Well it turns out that Dim Sum (for those of you who don't know, such as myself) is best experienced in a group, and they have servers bring out carts with plates of different items and ask if you want some.  Whether it be sticky pork bbq rolls (Very good) or some sort of beef rice noodle, there is about 4 portions per plate.  They set them on the table and everyone dug in.

Now I'm not the most picky eater, in fact I like to think of myself as somewhat adventurous, but when my colleague asked for the chicken feet I was somewhat taken aback.  Almost felt like a \"survivor\" competition... but I just couldn't get myself to eat it.  Those who did claimed it was really good... so I let them finish them off.

Everyone I was with really loved the food, and I really liked what I did try, so I'm going to give this place 5 stars for its authenticity and food.  I would comment on the price, but I didn't pay, so I'm not too sure on that end. 

There seems to be a lot of different options of this place, but I can only tell what I experienced.  They do have a large \"under new management\" banner out front, so maybe that explains the bad reviews in the past."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times but this time I was not impressed. I think part of it was that by the time I was seated, the carts were wheeling around potstickers, buns, sesame balls-- all the expand-in-your-stomach stuff.

I know they have some great seasoned bok choy, roast duck, taro potato (it looks creepy hairy on the outside but it's good if you're in the mood).

Service was all right-- kind of slow but not upsettingly so."}
{"text":"Being from Orange County, I grew up eating at some really great Dim Sum places. Though this place doesn't quite have the variety and the atmosphere of other places I've been to, the food is pretty good. Being from Phoenix, it's a bit of a drive to come out here to eat, however, it's conveniently located in an shopping center with Lee Lee's (Asian grocery) and a Boba tea place. There's also a Pho restaurant in the same lot, though I've never tried it."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and ordered 3 dishes. Overall the food was decent.  Nothing too exciting or special. I probably enjoyed the free soup that came with the dinner more than the dishes. I may go back to try their dim sum one day."}
{"text":"Best place for Dim Sum. They have a constant turn over of hot, fresh dishes and  yummy baked goods coming out on the floor. There is always a lot of people waiting to get seated, but the wait is fast. We love this place."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been to! Nothing good to say about this place. Food was awful, we ordered a few plates and I was nauseous after eating here! When we got home I threw up!! Not clean and very fatty food. 
Also, service was even worse. The workers there were racist if you were not Chinese! We were ignored the whole time, they even seated us far from all the other customers and only one cart came to our table. The rest ignored us. They spoke in a very rude tone. Also at the end we were charged a service fee, but never got any service! 
Very disappointed. Will never waste my time here again, worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 dinners at Phoenix Palace...got home...no rice. So I call, because I don't know if it doesn't come with. 

They forgot. So I drive back and tell them I will be there in 10. They are OUT of rice. Can I wait? Well I am sure not going to leave without it.  Been waiting for 15 minutes so far."}
{"text":"Solid dim sum place. Hai gow shut Mai pai gwat and Shen feung.  Quick service carts and good prices."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The best dim sum I've had so far since I've started living in AZ! The food is good and the place is very spacious, not over crowded like the one in PHX.."}
{"text":"Not a buffet, but really good restaurant overall. Definitely not a \"five-star\" establishment in the traditional sense, but if you want good Chinese food at good prices with a true Chinese restaurant feel, this is a good place."}
{"text":"never ever come back , food not even warm , roast pork smell weird , the guy cut my roast post look at me like i'm from earth , he not happy to service customers , i told him pick non fat one , he look at me  weirdo , so bad"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best DimSum ever! So delicious and fresh. Great service- will definitely come again and again. So happy I found this place. 
Moved to AZ  from Seattle, Washington didn't think I would find a decent Dimsum place. But i did!"}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in the Phoenix metro area. Great food and great service.  Best coconut and snow buns. I have been to MANY dim sum restaurants and Phoenix Palace is definitely the best!!"}
{"text":"I am not an expert on Dim Sum.  I simply know what I like.

The carts were constantly being refreshed and there was some additional staff tempting us with specials.  We stopped in before lunch on a Sunday.  As soon as we set down the carts were at our table.

I really liked the BBQ pork buns.  Some of the best that I have ever had.  The vegetables were also great.  The tea was good. Everything we had was good."}
{"text":"The service here alone is the best I experienced in a while. The food was delicious and to top it off, we were given dessert that was also very delicious! I will definitely come here again and will recommend this resturant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Dim Sum? For those who are unfamiliar with Dim Sum; essentially, it is a type of Chinese cuisine in which was modified down from what would only be served to kings and queens as a delicate to something everyone can enjoy. Ideally, it is best to eat this for breakfast and/or brunch. 
Anyway, I believe this place serves one of the best Dim Sum in the Phoenix Area. 
What better than to have little Asian ladies push around their Dim Sum carts around to your table and serve you food. Anything from steamed to baked; it is as good as it gets. Several of my favorite dishes are: Pork Dumplings, Shrimp Dumplings, Bean Curd (it sounds weird but pretty good for vegetarians), Beef and Shrimp Rice Noodles with soy sauce, Chicken Feet (normally, Americans don't like this but give it a shot), baked goods like custard buns, custard tarts, pineapple custard buns, coconut buns. These are just a few that I've named; there are many more delicious goodies. 
Everything must be downed with a cup of warm tea. Mmmm. Yum.

This place is cleaner than most Chinese restaurants and their customer service (even for dinner) is not bad."}
{"text":"This is my first time to try this restaurant for dinner. I ordered some BBQ pork and chicken, saw the cook dropped the meat on the dirty table but he still tried to give that to me. I asked him please do not - and he sneaked that piece of meat back into the pan to be sold to others! I also ordered a plate of tofu per their recommendation. None are tasting good.

I later got very bad food poisoning from this dinner and I continue to throw up the next day when I was in airplane with a trip I must take. 

I will avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so usually I expect Chinese places to all be the usual stir fry style, takeout menu, not really unique kind of food.  Which is ok, because I love that particular food.  But something sets Phoenix Palace a notch above the rest.

The menu looked great, and I floundered over what to get, until we saw the family style options on the back.  For a flat rate per-person, you get soup to share, a plate of appetizers, and as many entrees as you have people.  That sounded perfect, and we got a nice variety of food to share with the table.  

The hot and sour soup was very tasty, and with a little soy sauce added, not too hot for my mild palette.  The crab puffs and egg rolls were top notch.  Sweet and Sour Chicken tasted like it was made with real quality chicken, had fresh breading, and flavorful sauce.  The Broccoli Beef had really tender meat and veggies, and is easily my favorite version of that dish from what I've tried elsewhere.  The Kung Pao Chicken wasn't as spicy as I expected, which was a good thing for me.  We had more than enough food, and the leftovers proved delicious the second time around too.

The service was attentive, though there was a bit of a language barrier.  I appreciate the authenticity of the restaurant all the way around.  This may very well turn in to my go-to Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I am not partial to Chinese food.  I will never eat it alone or if the dining option is left for me to decide.  Chinese cuisine is something I find mediocre in general.  That said a 3 star rating from me should be viewed as impressive as I'll always be a tough customer when it comes to Chinese food.

Beef lo mein was my dish of choice.  The noodles were good and it was served with ample cuts of beef.  I was impressed that the noodles weren't as veggie heavy as I've had at other places.  Typically it does not take very long before I'm picking over vegetation in search of noodles and/or meat.

My friend ordered squid with ginger and he was very impressed.  He lived with a Chinese woman for 2 years so he knows a thing or two about Chinese food.  He liked Phoenix Palace a lot.

The complimentary tea was good and a nice touch to the meal. 

Oddly enough this is the only Chinese restaurant I have visited and not received a fortune cookie at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Well, I came here for the Dim Sum, saturday around 6pm.  they were not serving Dim Sum, That's pretty bad specially when they are famous for it. second, there were to flights flying in my table, I had to get out before ordering food.      bad experience."}
{"text":"First time checking in but We've been comming here g or at least give years.  It's very \"authentic \" everyyhing... The push cart ladies 89% of whom all Speak mostly chinese.. Tastes better than China wall.. I p the roasthe great Wall back c k in phoenix... Thumbs up price us reasonable,  standard dimsum selection, all the right sauces, chrysanthemum tea.. Everything."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed to leave a bad review because I was so excited about my trip across town for dim sum.  I normally head to Great Wall on Camelback but the pictures for Phoenix Palace looked awesome.  So thought I'd try a new place.  Unfortunately it was the most unbelievable experience I've had in quite a while.  

First off, we arrive and took a few minutes to be seated.  That's fine. No worries there.  As we sat waiting for carts and hopefully a waitress to grab us some drinks, the staff walked by us numerous times.  Not in a manner that they were urgently helping other customers. Just wandering around.  Again, that didn't bug us one bit.  

Few minutes go by again, finally the first cart and waitress head to our table at the same time.  Now, while they are both at our table,  we try to order our drinks but the waitress is too busy talking to the lady with the cart.  All she hears is hot tea for a split second and bolts.  I actually was hoping for just a water but ok.  But that was after we were trying to select our dim sum from the cart.  Every split second we tried to order, the waitress interrupts us to talk with the cart lady.  That went on for a few minutes. 

Second bad experience was when the same cart lady pulls up with another cart a while later with different options.  She pulls straight up to our table and then a customer walks right up and places an order with her.  So the cart lady pulls her cart 5 feet away from our table and helps the lady instead.  After she finishes that up, she takes the cart away and heads to the other side of the room that she already came from.  Completely ignoring us. 

Next we were hoping to order a few items that didn't seem to be on the carts.  That seemed to be what was going on with all the other tables around us.  Every time we tried to flag anyone down, we were ignored for the tables that had Chinese customers.  Granted, we are Asian as well.  Just Thai nationality.  But clearly ignored for not being Chinese.  

The experience is far worse than what I'm describing because I'm trying to sum it up quickly but I wanted to at least give a low down.  

We made the firm decision that we would never be returning.  The only person who cared for our attention and gave us any kindness was the second cart lady who didn't speak any English.  We have never experienced this bad of service at Great Wall. Even though it's not fantastic service, we are never ignored to the point of what we experienced today."}
{"text":"This is for the dim sum... 

Being that I'm from California and I'm use to fresh dim sum through the day (during dim sum hours, of course). I called in at around 2PM and they stop serving dim sum at 3. I make it there in 15 minutes, got a seat, and almost everything was gone and was not fresh. Although the chicken feet came out fresh since I waited 15 minutes for it, it was not good. It was edible... But nowhere near to ANY of the restaurants I've been at. I actually spat it out. My BF had one with a nail still in it. 

The 3 star is based on their customer service alone. It's not somewhere I'd go to again to for dim sum nor would recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum in the East Valley... generally the best of the best rotates every other year... as chef's move or some new hot shot comes in from Cali or HK...  for the moment.. it's here!

Another cool part is that, though not as fresh by the time you take it to go, is you could order dim sum off the menu... or on the right as you enter, some of the dim sum is there ready for you to take home for an impromtu meal or snack.

Haven't done dinner here yet, sort of scared too in case the dishes don't live up to the spectucular yum of its dim sum!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, my favorite place for my Chinese food cravings. Portions are large, prices are maybe a little higher than other restaurants but I love the food so don't mind paying a few $$ extra"}
{"text":"We came later then usual 11:30am on Sunday. The selection today was very sparse. Recommend coming here in the 10 o clock hour."}
{"text":"Takeout wasn't fast, but they did apologize as they had to make the rice cakes.  Service wasn't the best, but they weren't outright rude.  The woman at the cash register did open up became more friendly and outgoing as she packed up the part of our order that was taking a while.

Shrimp ball: Bland, not crunchy enough, probably my least favorite 

Shoumai: Great texture, very meaty.

BBQ pork bun: More savory than most, a lot less sugary and more authentic than the hot pink varieties many places have.  Really great.

Spareribs: Very moist but very fatty, my second least favorite.

Baked custard bun: Extremely good!  Fluffy and really good when warm.  Not too sweet,

Egg tart: Now here's where the sugar is.  Very sweet but good.

Sesame seed ball: Nice mild sweetness level of black bean inside, but they were too crispy/overcooked.

I'm still not sure whether is was the sweet or sticky rice cake, but think it was sweet...the white dessert ones...were very light, chewy, and definitely a great dessert without the heaviness of custard or being deep fried."}
{"text":"Their employees are not ADA (American with Disabilities Act) trained. I came here in the morning with my service dog. They almost denied us access by stating that we would be seated at the corner away from other customers. Their concern was that children would be afraid of my dog. 

I came back because I still wanted dim sum at noon. The manager was there, and she was very apologetic about what happened earlier. My service dog and I sat at a booth by ourselves while I enjoyed my meal. 

The food's fine. I grew up in CA so dim sum isn't going to be A+ par, but for the service and earlier incident today I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's not a buffet, just the regular dim sum carts. Not very bustling and had to wait around a bit for carts (not slow, just not back-to-back like it is at busier places) but I like their sticky rice and pineapple buns a lot. Everything else a tiny notch above C-Fu just because it's slightly less oily and the prices are lower. :)"}
{"text":"When I first moved to AZ 17 years ago, you couldn't even find a restaurant that serves dim sum. Now, foodies have a choice of where to eat their dim sum! This restaurant is one of the better choices. Always get my cravings satisfied here; my favorites are the fried noodles but, really, I like it all. Fun to come in a group! Many Chinese come here, which leads me to believe that it must hit the spot for those who know the cuisine well!"}
{"text":"This place has me seriously reconsidering where I live and contemplating a move to Chandler. This is where I find cultural hotspots like asian markets, boba cafes and finally....dim sum! The hubs and I tried dim sum in Central Phoenix at the Chinese Cultural Center - no bueno. We went once and never had an urge to go back.  We had almost given up hope in finding a decent dim sum place when we strolled upon Phoenix Palace Buffet. 

Dim Sum ends at 3pm and we stopped in at 2:30pm. They were still welcoming and stocked with fresh food choices. We tried their sticky rice, bbq pork buns, shrimp dumplings, rice noodles and taro cakes. One bite and we knew this place was legit. 

We are sooooo looking forward to when we can go there again. The only downside is that it's a good 30 minute drive to this area so we can't enjoy dim sum on a weekly basis like we used to in SoCal. Bummer."}
{"text":"Good overall. My complaints:
1. we were semi accosted as soon as we sat down. It was post lunch rush on a Saturday, and every cart came to us immediately and pushed things into my hands that I wasn't sure I wanted. 
2. several items were greasy. The chinese broccoli was good, but I did feel like I needed to dab it on my napkin. 
3. after the initial rush of 5 or so dishes, the carts didn't come around much anymore. 
But I did enjoy myself and will most likely go back. The broccoli was crunchy and flavorful and the prices were reasonable ($30 for 2)."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Food poisoning. Never returning.

This place gets a 5 star review for being the best dim sum restaurant in the valley.  Sure I've had better in SF, but this is still pretty good.  
Major bonus points for the takeout counter.  I don't know what most of this stuff is called, but I know what it looks like.  I was able to give the girl a description and she knew exactly what it was.  I've now got pictures on my phone for future visits.
I think it's a step above their competitor on the other side of the street, but their competitor seems to have a wider selection.  At least in the carts that are going around.  
Bonus points for having a gelato shop a few doors down.  Not that you'll be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"Dim sum was ok...hot tea cup is there for each plate...they will charge u all even if one person drinks!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this place isn't my favorite dim sum ever (reigning title goes to Yank Sing in San Francisco).  But when I get that craving for some delicious carb focused dim sum, Phoenix Palace is where I go.  It's the best we know of in the valley to feed our fix and definitely affordable.  bbq pork buns are my favorite :)  

So if you're looking for some good dim sum in the valley, head here, because you won't find better unless you head to SF or China."}
{"text":"Pretty freaking good Dim Sum!  It takes a while to get in sometimes on weekend mornings but overall not too bad.  You can count on PP to be open on holidays too!  Only downfall it is incredibly smushed together and sometimes the carts don't always make it to the tables in the middle, so definitely request a perimeter table.  Larger parties seem to get seating priority which can make going as a party of 2 a little frustrating, but other than that I have no qualms.  Will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Dim sum in Arizona wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's not the best, but I mean it does the trick. There was nothing special or all that memorable about any of the dishes that we tried. I always like the pork buns which was good here too. It was fluffy and the pork was sweet. The tofu with simple syrup was good, but I felt like it was too gingery for my taste. My sister said she loved it because of the ginger taste, but I wasn't a fan. They also had seaweed salad which was a first for me. I've never seen seaweed salad at a dim sum place, so I was happy. However, they gave us a lot and we couldn't finish it. All in all a good dim sum spot if you are craving it!"}
{"text":"Was wanting to try the DIM SUM here.  I picked Mother's Day to do it so the large crowd of people waiting to get in should not have surprised me.  They were mostly asian families so that gave me a clue that I was in a good place.  Expected a 30 minute wait and it was about 40.  Yet, I was surprised that it was not an hour considering all those people waiting outside their doors.  
I was surprised  that they have white tablecloths too.  It's kind of a big place and it's got to be an expense but they do it despite the fact that they are not a high end restaurant. I liked that.  Now to the food.  We ordered from the Dim sum as well as the regular menus.  

DIM SUM:  
Chinese broccoli:  A large portion of fresh, sautéed, al dente & delicious broccoli. Better than the broccoli sold in the  regular supermarket.  The stalks reminded me of Asparaus stalks.   5 stars

Fried Tofu:    4 large, greaseless chunks with a side sweet sauce   5 stars
Chicken Feet:  (Yeah baby, chicken feet) 6 tender,  gelatinous, yummy feet in a great sauce  5 stars
Shanghai Dumplings:  4 smallish pork-filled, broth-filled dumplings.  5 stars.

Off the regular menu, hubby ordered sautéed chicken in an orange sauce and requested that the chicken not be breaded. The large portion of chicken was amazingly tender with a really delicious sauce.  5 stars.  
Did I tell you they give you free hot tea?  Yes they do and the tea is the real deal made with loose tea leaves.  Nice touch.
Service was really amazing considering the crowds at this place today.  The young man was extremely patient with us explaining the DIM SUM options and orchestrating hubby's breadcrumb-free chicken.  
The only negative was the checkout. You have to bring the check to the cashier in the front and there was quite a line to pay your bill.  I am not penalizing them for this as it was my idea to come on a major holiday.  Duh.....
This was my first time here but it won't be my last! (check out all 5 photos!)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Dim sum is great, and can be as adventurous or as tame as you want it.  The selections on the carts are numerous and inexpensive.  And they don't just make the rounds once and disappear, they keep coming until you either explode or summon the willpower to say no.  I always eat too much at these places.  I can't say no to bbq pork buns, or bbq duck (they have these hanging in the front window for sale at reasonable prices if you're feeling the need.  I'm the only duck commander at my house so I usually have to pass, but they'll do 1/4 to the whole thing.  I'll be back).  I ate until I physically couldn't any more.  Everything from dumplings to shrimp toast to green beans to chicken feet-- if there's something you want, they have it on one of these carts rolling around.  And if you don't know what something is, they're happy to tell you.  This is super helpful if you're new to dim sum, or even if you've had it before but spot something new to try.  I just wish they'd cut me off before I need a bucket! Be prepared to wait a bit, but not too long to lose interest and move on.  Be prepared for an awesome meal and good service.  Our tab for two large mammals who ate to the point of misery was under $40, so its reasonably priced.  The only drawback is that they only do dim sum for lunch.  You gotta drag your butt outa bed, but its so worth it!"}
{"text":"Try their dinner dishes too! Their BBQ duck is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Hello awesome! Love this restaurant - their dim sum is delicioussss! They've got great selections, and I love being able to head over to their bakery area and snag a couple bun things to go. Service is not so great - but seriously - what do you expect, it's really not unusual for this sort of setup. I would give it 5 stars except that I hate their char-siapao - the bbq bun - this is one of my faves, since I was a little kid and theirs taste blech. I go here often, and stuff my face - awesome food for an awesome price."}
{"text":"Well, best dim sum place in the valley. Hands down."}
{"text":"First things first ... contrary to its name, this place is not a Buffet, at least in the traditional sense. Also - Dim Sum Hours are limited, so check their website.

Three of us went to Phoenix Palace to celebrate a friend's birthday and enjoy a nice Dim Sum brunch. We were promptly greeted and seated at a nice table in the aisle (which is by the way prime seating - the carts were whizzing by offering all kinds of delectable things). I was happy to find that the vast majority of customers (90% or more) were Asian and heard quite a bit of Cantonese and Mandarin being spoken, so I know this place must be close to authentic to garner this kind of \"street cred\" among the Asian crowd. By noon, the place was almost chock full. So point of advice, get there by 11 AM to get a good table and avoid a wait.

 The Dim Sum on offer was overall very good, very tasty. The skin items (dumplings) were very good, and the pork buns were also very good (though a little bit more pork might have been a bit better). Overall the portion sizes were decent (three of most things, four of other things), and I could conceivably see one filling up here for under $10 easily, but we had a birthday to celebrate after all. The only thing that was under par was the rice noodle shrimp, which is basically a giant rice noodle wrapped around shrimp then steamed, it was just a tad over steamed. I had a nice rice congee with Chao Quay (fried bread), which reminded me of Indonesia (we called it Chakwe there - almost the same thing) ... oh the memories... but I digress. 

Service was prompt, efficient, and the quality was good. Staff were responsive to our questions about what things were and what they had. Also I didn't see the congee cart and asked the waitress if they had congee, she said yes and asked me what kind I wanted, and she ran over to the cart and got me my congee. Excellent service. The price was very good ... we had a total of 14 dishes between the three of us, plus tea service for me, and iced tea for one, and water for the other. The total bill was about $40 for three people, which I have to say is less than the tab for the three of us at other brunch locales downtown (though to be fair, it was quite a lot of food). 

Overall, a great place for the Dim Sum neophyte. Though perhaps not the caliber of places in San Francisco or even the mecca of Dim Sum (Hong Kong), this is certainly one of the better places in the valley for Dim Sum. 

Positives:  A good example of traditional Dim Sum (if not a perfect one),
                 Good food, great place for groups. Good service. The place 
                 is also VERY clean. 

Negatives:  For me this is a positive, but a due warning to Westerners with ideas of being \"culturally superior\" or otherwise demanding tourists:  Goinghere is akin to a mini trip to Hong Kong or even China. Be aware that eating Dim Sum is not just a different culinary experience, but also is about participating in a different culture and pace of life. Have an open mind, and above all BE PATIENT. So if you don't see the carts (or the cart you want) coming by for a few of minutes, chill out, enjoy your tea or other beverage, and relax. If you can't handle this, go to a Chinese Buffet. 

Oh yes, and before I forget, GRADES:

Overall:   A- (no other demerits taken other than mentioned below)

Service:  A-  (The only major demerit on service was that the English 
                       spoken by some of the cart pushers was not intelligible
                       however this is excusable as this is a Chinese place - 
                       the \"specials\" board was completely in Chinese)

Food:   A-  (A good example of traditional Dim Sum. Some demerits 
                   include over steamed Shrimp rice noodle [some firmness
                   is better], the Har Gao (shrimp dumplings) were good, 
                   but on the verge of being over-steamed)

Drinks:  No Grade (we did not consume any alcoholic beverages, so no grade is given in this category - though I have to say my Oolong tea was delicious)."}
{"text":"I really want to give NO STAR. This is absolutely the worst restaurant ever. No service. Had to get my own water jug to pour my own water.  and the food is absolutely horrible. i wouldn't call it chinese food. i wouldn't even call it asian food. It's edible. that all i can say.  It's a restaurant to fool white people who never had real chinese cuisine.  It's lucky its in AZ, because if this food court were in CA, it would never survive.  NO chinese ppl with a decent palate will ever walk into this imitation panda express which is worse than panda express.  i feel sorry for AZ residents where good cuisine is really lacking."}
{"text":"I was glad to find another dim-sum place in this area because the one we used to frequent of the same name (minus \"Buffet\") closed down on Ray and Dobson.   We walked in on a weekday afternoon for dim-sum lunch and were quickly seated.  The ladies were quick with stopping by with carts of little stainless-steel containers.  They popped the top off and would say what they were (of course she could've said \"fried donkey ears\" in Chinese and I would'n't have known the difference)... my friend and I tried maybe 4 or 5 little dim-sum plates plus noodles for my friend and the bill was... gasp... 12 dollars total - yeah, SUPER cheap! 

I don't know what good or bad dim-sum is, but I know that this was filling, flavorful, priced well and when I googled what I ate later that night, my pics looked the same as those online.  Note that there was definitely a language barrier, but be patient.. they offer good service and you're definitely being served by hard-working staff.  I would return for dim-sum again here."}
{"text":"Best place to get dim sum on the weekends.  Much better selections, qualities, and staff than Great Wall Cuisine on 35th Avenue & Camelback Road.  They made their food and prepared everything on-site.  It's a must place to visit if you want to try everything all at once."}
{"text":"I'm up waiting for laundry so I thought I'd catch up on all of my food adventure reviews. 

You know in the east valley vicinity there is absolutely NO dim sum fare worth the money. Maybe maybe maybe the one inside me kong. 

I have visited a number of dim sum restaurants in many different states and this one by far has got to be the worst one. 

I've been here at least 10 times because people keep wanting to try it and I keep telling them no but they want dim sum. Whatever. You pay I'll come be your side kick. 

When we visited phoenix palace they came by our table many times and we got a few dishes to start and they came back mid finishing of the dishes and we declined and then they came back again but we were still working on what we had so we asked them to come by later. Well.... Maybe we should have jumped at the opportunity of getting something else but they didn't come by anymore. So after flagging down a wait staff to order rice rolls we finished that and that was it. My friend went to go pay and I had gotten up to use the restroom. Just then a lady staff member stopped me and said excuse me but tip is not included with your bill. I was so puzzled. First we hadn't officially left, second I was going to be restroom and lastly if they didn't have us go pay at the register maybe they would have known that we left the tip on the charge card. I literally paid a dollar to leave the table and go to the bathroom and didn't even go. I'm so glad I didn't cause a scene it's not worth it. I also came to the front and told the gal who sat us what happened and gave her $4 more dollars to tip the other wait staff and advised them they really shouldn't treat their patrons like this... Unfortunately, the word hasn't gotten out. I told my friend about this and they laughed bc the same thing happened to them. So maybe it's time to review this place. 

Food: 2 stars. You have to know how to mix sauces for it to taste ok.

Atmosphere: it's a Chinese restaurant that serves dim sum. I didn't make it to the bathroom so I can't tell you how clean it is. They are slow to seat you but rush you out but if you go on a slow day there's nobody there so it seems like they don't make fresh foods. 

Staff: 0 stars this place has changed hands and management. I don't worry about how great personalities are in places like this but the cross guard at the end of the meal totally  made me feel angry. I'm easily disappointed but rarely do I get pissed. I think there's a huge opportunity to have really good dim sum here that is strictly dim sum and really only needs to be open 3-4 days a week. This is how other places I've gone to operate. 

Will I recommend this place? I've been against it since the second set of owners didn't improve but every time... \"They have new owners maybe it's different.\" Yep NO it hasn't improved. 

What would I change? We need to call Gordon Ramsay on this one. 

The only pro: take out roasted meats hanging in the windows."}
{"text":"*** This review is only for their Dim Sum ***
After driving all over town for a dim sum, this is our favorite... they offer the basics in the traditional carts and they do it consistently well.  Amongst our favorites are: Lo Mai Gai, Har Gow, Har Cheug, Siu Mai  Xiao Long Bao, Char Siu Bao (baked & steamed), Hom Siu Gok, Eggplant stuffed with Shrimp, Daan Taat, Sesame Balls, Sponge Cake (Mai Gai Loh), Steamed Beef Tripe, Vegetables (usually Gai Lan or Green Beans in black bean sauce), and Pork Belly if we are extra hungry.

If you want to avoid the crowds during the weekend, get there between 10-11:30am; otherwise, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"The dim sum here are better at the moment, used to be unappealing. There is definitely something wrong with the shrimp fried rice. I continually tried to give them chances after chances to improve, but all 3 times the shrimps had this pee-like taste and smell! They are definitely not fresh, but rather long-dead and smelly! Other than their dim sum, lunch and dinner are not great. The roasted pork is ok, in the mean time. The father of the owner, who usually in charge of roasted and BBQ area is extremely rude and loud."}
{"text":"This review is only for their dim sum.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall next to a huge Chinese grocery store.  The restaurant was overflowing with patrons.  It looked very promising.  I got seated pretty quickly and the carts started coming.  I sampled most of the usual items.  All were pretty good but it just didn't quite have that satisfying feeling afterward."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Phoenix Palace this afternoon for Dim Sum and had a great meal. Neither of us are Dim Sum veterans. Being from Northern California originally I have been to a few places, but it was my husband's very first time. The staff was very friendly and the food was great! My husband, a picky eater, especially loved the sesame buns with red bean filling and the buns with egg custard.
There are 2 reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars. I was especially looking forward to Xiao Long Bao, better known as soup dumplings. I read that they served them here, but when the carts were circling they were nowhere to be found. They are my absolute favorite dim sum so that was a bit disappointing.
The other reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that we felt a bit overwhelmed. As soon as we were seated every single cart came up to our table and waited in line to pitch us their dishes. They would ask repeatedly if we wanted the same dishes after we said no before they walked away. It would have been a bit nicer of an experience if they were circulating more a gave us a chance to breathe a bit.
All and all though we had a wonderful experience. Delicious food, and the price is great! We could have easily fed 4 with the amount of food we got (we wanted to try a bit of everything) and ended up with lots of leftovers to box up and take home. Friendly people, yummy food, fun experience! We will definitely be back, and hopefully next time I will get my soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"I award four stars to Phoenix Palace as comparing within the greater Phoenix area.    It would be a 2 1/2 if comparing it to spots in San Francisco or Vancouver, B.C.  Phoenix Palace satisfied my craving for dim sum with the run of the mill but tasty dumping of the popular kinds.  Staff is very friendly and most have a good command of the English language.   (Which I appreciate since I ask many questions and do not understand any Chinese dialect.) My dining partner today,  loved it and is already planning who to bring on his return visit!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum during the weekend. Some of the food (such as the green beans and spring rolls) are cold. The spring rolls are good enough that you do not mind eating them cold, but the green beans stir fry just taste bad when you eat them cold.
They have more variety and the service is actually better during the weekend. Do not go during the week."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, never had a problem with the food. Service is a hit or miss, but dim sum places are always on the unfriendly side from personal experience (aside from ding tai feng). 

The most recent time I came here was with a group of 20. One of the people made a reservation so we were seated pretty quickly without any issues despite how busy it was. The carts came swarming before everyone got here. I was pleasantly surprised with the frequency of the cart visits. Each cart minded their own business, though - if you ask for something that they don't have, they'll just tell you to wait. 

We ordered the shrimp dumplings, shumai, sweet rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaf, ribs, turnip cake, and lots of desserts. I recommend the turnip cake and the shrimp dumplings! With a table of 10, we spent 116 with tax and tips included. Good pricing for the amount of food we ordered!"}
{"text":"2.9 stars - sub-standard dimsum, dishes ordered below:

ORDER
Shrimp tofu - favorite dish, tofu was excellent
Short ribs in black bean sauce - tasty, what you might expect
Turnip cake - a bit oily but full of turnip, great flavor 
Taro cake - a bit dry but loved the fresh taro, this dish can be hard to find
Shao mai (siu mai) pork dumplings - decent 

SKIP
Rice noodle roll with shrimp (chang fen) - shrimp was juicy and tasty, the rice cake itself was 
Shrimp dumplings (xia jiao) - smallest shrimp dumplings I've ever seen at any dimsum spot
Shrimp dumplings with chives - had to actually send this back, chives might've been rotten, which gave the dumplings a sour taste

On the upside, service was pretty good, servers do a good job of rounding the large restaurant with carts. Good for groups, takes reservations."}
{"text":"Dim sum is the shit! I didn't have to eat for the rest of the day & the tea was amazing too. If you like eating delicious food with friends continuously for hours come here.

I came with people experienced at dim sum, & they were like my tour guides in a foreign land. I loved it & would go again in a second.

Go with a group of friends, get there early enough to get a table, & stuff yourself with delicious food!"}
{"text":"The Chandler area does not have many Dim Sum places to eat and this one just started adding this cart driven lunch program to theirs not too long ago so I figured it must be worth trying.

I forwent my usual place and we headed over here for lunch.  (The area is great because Lee Lee's market is in the same plaza.)

Two stars right off the bat for friendliness and I feel that makes a huge difference no matter the experience.  However the place had maybe 20 people seated and a few workers who seemed to be quite busy.  We had our tea and drinks quickly, and the cart came immediately.

Unfortunately the food was not very good. 

We ordered Chinese broccoli, and the fish sauce was very salty making the dish inedible.
We ordered sui mai (pork balls) and it was overly chewy and passed on that too.
We ordered hau goa (shrimp balls) and the shrimp was very dirt and lots of shell.  No thanks, pass.
We ordered steamed stuffed buns (bao zi) and the buns still tasted raw and the filling was hardly noticeable and very sweet but didn't taste like anything more that BBQ sauce.
Lastly we ordered the rice shrimp noodle and the shrimp was some version of dried shrimp and not steamed at all.  On top of that the rice noodle was very gritty probably using flour instead of rice.

Overall we had a few bites of 5 dishes for $25 and left everything on the table and headed across the street to my favorite local place."}
{"text":"Went there several times. Came away thoroughly satisfied every time. :) I usually don't like dim sum that much, mind you."}
{"text":"The best baked pork buns that we've ever had and we've had lots of pork buns. Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese buffets go, this is one of the best.  However, the downside to that is the price - you'll be paying about $14 per person (plus the cost of sodas if you want them).  If this was $5 cheaper, I would've given them 4 stars.  Regardless, it's a fun place to go to.

One of my favorite things about this place is that they just have an enormous selection of different foods.  They have lots of the standard Chinese buffet foods you would expect, but they also have sushi, a few different kinds of buns and dumplings, and then just random things that I would assume are fairly authentic.  I've had pig ears, chicken feet, and jellyfish here, so if you want to try something new or disturb your squeamish friends, you have a lot of opportunity for that.  Last time I went they didn't have any jellyfish out which was disappointing because honestly, jellyfish is pretty delicious.  If they have it while you're there, try it out.

There are generally a LOT of Asian people at Phoenix Palace Buffet, which to me seems like a good sign that this is at least semi-authentic.  Also, they have a gigantic space in their building and have way, way too much seating, so you shouldn't have to worry about trying to find enough chairs and tables for a large group.

One last thing - don't forget to try the lotus seed paste buns.  They're a semi-sweet dessert bun and they're awesome."}
{"text":"Went there today only to find a big sign on the door that says \"Closed for Renovations\" which is never a good thing in my experience.  SIgn says \"maybe we'll open by Wednesday\" but of course which Wednesday is not specified.  Noted that several other people were coming to the door and being disappointed.  Too many dim sum places closing--not a great trend.  Hope this is truly just for renovations."}
{"text":"Tried dim sum here today. We are dim sum fanatics and try it in most cities we visit. I won't even compare Seattle or San Francisco dim sum - that is a league beyond AZ. 

However several of the dishes are pretty good: shumai, shrimp dumplings, and baked barbecue pork buns.  The rest are average. The staff is great, friendly, and attentive. The vibe is fine. 

C-Fu used to be better but they became pretty mediocre several years ago. This is better than the current C- Fu, but not better than the good old days. 

I've never been a fan of Great Wall. 

So, the question for all you local dim sum fans is \"where is the best dim sum in Phoenix these days?\"  We can't find first rate fare in this city."}
{"text":"Good isn't too bad for dim sum. We got there around 11a and there was about a 15 min wait. It took some time for the carts to make their rounds but we left full and satisfied. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here just once on a Saturday and it was busy.  Lucky though, we got there when they had just opened and since they have private rooms for large gatherings, it seemed like we had the whole place (or room) to ourselves.

We had several traditional Chinese dishes, but from the aromas and the crowds, I'm guessing the Dim Sum was really good.  The family style dish portions were good and the food was fresh and tasty.  However, I do wish they used just a little less sesame oil to cook the dishes, which were on the oily side.  Parking was okay, but the shopping center gets packed fast on the weekends.  Restrooms were very clean too (a plus at Asian restaurants)."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in the East Valley. Try to get there as early as 11AM for fresh and full cart of Dim Sum. If you go there late there won't be much left. I love baked bbq pork buns. Custard buns are great too, more custard than flours! Love it! Service can be slow on the weekends due to the big crowds."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in Scottsdale and they brought us to eat here - twice.  We had a great dinner here on new years eve with my favorites - hot and sour soup and peking duck (among other things).  They had a huge private party going on, but pretty much gave us a private room with karaoke and served us pretty quickly. Despite getting here late, we still made it out of here in time to celebrate on our own.  We then returned for dim sum and were not disappointed. We had to wait a bit because we arrived late, but it was worth it.  The food was fresh and hot - and they had these desserts (snowballs or something) that we haven't found anywhere else. Our friends come here every weekend - and they are the ultimate foodies - so we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I love dim sum but, the food was okay. The service was not that great. It was very hard communicating with the servers and witnesses. They didn't seem to care. The prices were a bit high for dim sum. I got charged with an \"guest\" fee of 0.65 cent. What?!? So... I was charged for bringing my husband along with me?!? Wait... That doesn't make sense at all. My husband did not eat anything but did ordered an iced tea in which I was charged $2.79 for... so I don't understand what the \"guest\" fee of $0.65 cent was for. I'm also positive that they overcharged me. I only ate the a small cup soup, beef ripe and  shrimp dumplings and I drank water. My bill was $16.10? Wow. I won't be back. Can someone please tell me why they charged me a \"guest fee\"? Ugh."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I am craving dim sum. They have a sit-down section and a take-out section. It gets busy on the weekends, so go early! The older workers joke around with you and try to make you smile. It is good and the restaurant is next to an asian market and boba place, so you can go there afterwards."}
{"text":"Yikes we had my adopted father Mr. Eng funeral banquet here a year ago. 
Today it got 6 violations and a warning from the Health Dept to clean up or close down!  
Even then I thought the food was so-so. Many things were authntically presented but did not taste so well.

The service for a planned banquet was awful! My sister had to go head to head with the manager. We were waiting for tables upto 25 minutes and even then the tables were not grouped together. Their concern was making as much money as they could so they did not reserve any tables for the family/group!  Mind you we had a deposit down and planned menu!

I'm glad nobody that no one (I have heard from) got sick.
I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"Wow!  Nice surprise.  We are from Scottsdale and had to be in the Chandler area for something, so we decided to take advantage the Asian restaurant area and this was the one we chose.  It's pretty, quite large, and they were open on Monday and were serving Dim Sum.  It was a real treat.  The noodle part of the dim sum was quite good, not to thick, but also not delicate.  The individual dim sum that we tried....like 6 different ones...I would have to say, were tasty, nicely wrapped and steamed.  We are picky! and we are anxious to go back on a Saturday as they have even more options.  Yes, we would drive 15 miles to go back there, it was that good!"}
{"text":"THE PLACE TO BE for fast service and excellent dim sum. I've gone here twice, both on Sundays at 11am and 1pm, and both times I was seated immediately despite the fact that there was a LOT of people. I'm shocked that even at peak times there's no wait. (Maybe it's because we live in Arizona and not California anymore so there's a smaller Asian population? lol I have no idea, but I'm not complaining.)

I overheard a lady tell the host that she didn't want a table far away from the entrance because her mom was very frail and could not walk far into the restaurant. They had to wait a few minutes longer for a table but it was no problem to accommodate them. I thought that was very nice.

If you want to quickly order to-go desserts, you line up at the bakery at the side of the entrance! There's even free samples.

Now, onto the good stuff.. the dim sum experience! The second time I was seated, they brought me to the corner of an extra room they had wayyy in the back. The pessimist in me was concerned that I would miss out on all the dim sum carts, or that they would rarely visit our table. FEAR NOT - despite being in a small corner, in another room from the main dining hall, the cute pushcart ladies came VERY frequently. In fact, after ten minutes my table was already full of dim sum and we ended up overordering! Not to fret though because I love eating dim sum leftovers.

The excellent: xiao long bao (dumplings with soup inside, make sure you eat it quick while the soup is hot), the siu mai, cha siu bao, the chicken pot pie (lol no idea why this is a dim sum option, but it's really good and I found it in the same cart as the dessert cart), THE EGG TARTS.

The ok: curry bun, coconut macaroon, fried crispy taro (forgot the name but typically this is my favorite dim sum dish, but it was just OK here), radish cake, chicken feet. (My boyfriend loves chicken feet and he liked the ones here, I'm just not super into chicken feet in general.)

Honestly there wasn't anything I hated or disliked. Great variety of dim sum, fast service, and my tummy was happy.

OH - and THEIR EGG TART IS AMAZING. Get the one that looks more yolky and yellow. The egg tart that looks more cooked is still good, but if you get the yellower egg tart, IT'S SOOOO BOMB. Especially when they're newly made so they're still hot. Homg. Freaking amazing.

My bill ended up being $45 for two people, which is higher than usual, but keep in mind I was getting wayyyy too excited trying out all the dim sum. We ended up with LOTS of leftovers. Normally, two people at dim sum will come out with a check totaling around $30-$32.

Yes, I'm definitely returning and loading up on those egg tarts."}
{"text":"What a difference from the other location on Ray Rd...The place is rundown and the service was AWFUL.  

We were at the restaurant over the weekend for dinner.  The restaurant was less than half full with mostly Chinese people.  So we thought this could be promising.  When we sat down, the lady gave us the Chinese menu which is understandable...you know, b/c we are Asian.  But everything on the menu was just too authentic like duck's feet or pig's intestines and so we were just sitting there thinking...what should we do....Then we overheard the people sitting behind us ordering Orange Chicken, Kang Pao beef, etc.  When their waiter was about to pass us, we asked for the menu he was carrying and there you go, it was the English menu we are totally used to...whew.  

So we ordered the soup, friend rice, and seafood dish.  The wait for our food was around 40min or so...just sitting there waiting, starving.....In the mean time, the glowing fast food drive through menu was calling us from across the street through the window...that was not fun.  When we finally got our food, we asked for steamed rice....it NEVER came.  At that point, we were done.  We just sat there ate what was available and left.  

So why 3 stars? Because the food was pretty good.

*Food = everything was pretty good.  IF you are not used to the authentic Chinese food, be sure to ASK for the English menu or you will waste your time.
*Service = HORRIBLE.  If you are hungry and ready to eat dinner, go somewhere else
*Location = it is in the same complex as Lee Lee's Market so it is convenient I guess.
*Decor = horrid"}

{"text":"Eureka! I have found an incredible place for dim sum. It is so old school. The ladies wheeling around supersized servings of fried, steamed, sauteed, boiled, you name it, they have it dim sum delights. The place hums like a HK Chinese dim sum place, but the ladies are so nice and friendly. I was thrilled to practice my Cantonese with them. They also offer a variety of teas and happily accommodated my request for \"kook poh,\" a combination of chrysanthemum tea and bo lei tea. It is a lovely bittersweet mixture.

They have all the dim sum favorites: har kao, siu mai dumplings. Their char siu paos are to die for. The dough is steamed flawlessly fluffy and the filling, both sweet and savory. I enjoyed their chives dumpling very much. The skin was thin, panfried. The filling was texturific with the chives just cooked. The pei dan chok or Century egg porridge was pure comfort food. I liked their kai lan with oyster sauce. It was not overly sauced and veggies were still green and not overcooked. Their lo pak gou or white radish cake was nicely steamed and fried. I loved it. I could've eaten the whole plate. There were a few other dumpling dishes that I ate.

A huge shout out to Yelper, Karen W. for pulling a bunch of Yelpers plus foodies together to share this meal. It was both delectable and enjoyable. I have now found my dim sum haven in Greater Phoenix. The huge meal came up to $13 per head including tip. I came back that afternoon to pick up food to take home. My children devoured the char siu pao and siu long pao in less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I love this place for both DIM SUM and hot take out buffet. We have picked up roasted duck and crispy pork many times and ordered dim sum to-go and it has never disappoint. The place is huge, family style everything, a bit on the dirty side depending on where they seat you. It is warm but because the carts carry piping hot mini dishes. The staff hardly speak English, waitstaff can be slow but the dimsum is typically always on top of each stop. If you can get over the crazy lines out the door and wait time, the food is worth the wait. Expect a long wait on weekend lunch times though."}
{"text":"It's a typical dim sum place with a good amount of options and an additional menu to order food. The decor is a little outdated, and the bathrooms could be better."}
{"text":"I've been to all of the dim sum houses in the Phoenix area looking for one to replace my old Chicago favorite. I've yet to find anything in Arizona that even comes close to the freshness and amazing quality of what I'm used to. 

That being said, during the 3 years that I've lived in Arizona, I have seen the quality of dim sum that Phoenix Palace serves increase--their shrimp dishes used to be completely inedible, as were many of their dishes containing pork. The restaurant is generally clean, but they often do not serve you water unless you personally request it, and it is definitely not filtered/clean/pure water - it tastes like it came from a rusty tap, in my opinion. We prefer their chrysanthemum tea over green, so be sure to make a special request if you want to try it. The one plus side of this location is that their business is steady so they're able to offer a large variety of dim sum. 

Given the very few options we have here, this place is one of the better ones, although we prefer Mekong Palace in Mesa--and despite living close to Phoenix Palace, we usually make the longer drive to Mesa for dim sum more similar to the quality that we are used to."}
{"text":"Update - Just to say that I always like this place and stop off here when I am in the area, which isn't as often as it used to be.  Never tried the dim sum, though.  My favorite is Singapore style chow mei fun.  I get takeout, no msg please.  Friendly people."}
{"text":"The place to be for weekend dim sum.  We like Char shue buns, gailan, chicken feet, egg custard tarts,eggplant with shrimp dim sum,and sticky rice..the best is Hong King style chow mein with seafood...the portion is too big for two people ,and we are not complaining because the leftovers makes for another meal for both of us. Families and friends are all enjoying snacks,and food that are wheeled around the restaurant. Don't know what something is,they will explain ..it's a once a month event for us."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I think, overall, Phoenix Palace has the best dim sum in the Valley. I love scoring a table right where the carts come out. It sucks if you sit in a corner and all the food is either gone or cold by the time the ladies get to your table. I'll take my ticket to a cart across the room if we've been waiting too long. There are too many dishes to go over, but the congee here is excellent. The only dish that fell short was the har gow - skin too thick and shrimp was mushy and falling apart.  We ate a lot and our tab was about $11/pp. My current dim sum order of preference of distance wasn't a factor: phoenix palace, great wall, china king, mekong."}
{"text":"After dim summing at the Chinese Cultural Complex and the Great Wall in Phoenix, I feel confident declaring this the Valley winner for Dim Sum. I've been here a number of times over the years and have had a delicious experience each time. The key is to get there before 11:00AM so you don't have a long wait. Any time after 11:15AM pretty much guarantees the place will be packed to the brim.  Also, they run out of snowballs after 11:00AM and that is pretty much the most awesome pastry ever. PPB has loads of carts roaming around so you are never without food, and the prices are great. Obviously the bigger your party the lower your bill will be, no matter how much more you order. It's dim sum insanity! 

Seriously, who can eat 'regular' chinese food again after a healthy dose of steamed dumplings, soups, chicken feet and light fluffy pastries? 

Do yourself a favor and make the drive to Phoenix Palace Buffet!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was looking for a place for this parents to eat at and we were originally going to this other Chinese restaurant but took a wrong turn and ended up in this plaza so we just decided to eat here instead.

It was about 5pm - pretty early for dinner for Asian people at least - cause besides us, there was only one other diner in the place. It was so empty they even decided to turn off some of the lights in the restaurant. I didn't really expect that many people honestly - this is Arizona, and it is 5 PM.  

We sat down and ordered three dishes:
 
Chestnut and Chicken Pot - super flavorful dish! - chicken was tender and went very well with the chestnuts 

Crispy Noodles with Seafood Gravy - I really would have liked it more if they didn't drench it with the gravy because I do like the crispy part of the noodles but since they poured a lot of sauce onto it - all the noodles got soaked. 

Chinese Veggie (Choi Sum with garlic) - tender and garlicky. 

The food was surprisingly very tasty. I expected not very good Chinese food here but to my amazement, the food was pretty decent - however it did cost way more than Chinese restaurant in say like San Gabriel or Monterey Park area (for those of you from LA would know what I'm talking about) here it's like about double the price - but i think it's because they don't get half as busy as in other places that are populated with Asian people. 

The waiters and waitresses looked pretty bored most of the time - but things started to pick up around 6ish when we were about to leave. Reviews say that this place is good for dim sum - I wish I could try it but since my bf graduated today I don't think I'll be coming back to Arizona any time soon. 

Overall however I think this is a pretty good place for dinner - the prices a little higher but like I said there aren't too many other Chinese restaurants like this around."}
{"text":"I have been  told that this is the best dimsum restaurant  in the  east valley of in phoenix .we got there early . Food was coming out quickly . It was very fresh and hot . The  shrimp  roll was very dry and tasteless.  The  sticky bun lacked meat and the sauce was not sweet. I did like the beef noodles  however the meat was missing  cilantro  . There was plenty  of variety. They got busy by 11.00 am . Prices were a little high . We were also charged for water.i would have given the restaurant  3 and half stars"}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't written a review of this place yet.  Been there at least 5 times; well I do enjoy dim sum; and really enjoy Phoenix Palace.  The moon cakes; are wonderful pastries that I always have to get when I'm there.  The only draw back is the \"waiting\" area; it's not very large and just like Great Wall; it can get very crowded very fast.  I'm definately a fan!!!"}
{"text":"I like their dim sum but just recently tried their dinner. We had their Peking duck which was a little  overcooked .the duck was a little lean. Also tried their seafood soup  which had small pieces of ocupus needed more flavor.we also tried the lobster with green onion and ginger sauce. It was flavorful but the lobster was small and difficult  to get meat out if small pieces. Restaurant  was slow."}
{"text":"Phoenix Palace is a favorite in my family.  This is definitely on our rotation of Chinese food. Usually we come for dim sum and the food is always good.  Of course the ambiance is not beautiful but the food definitely makes up for that."}
{"text":"it is not the best dim sum i have had. but just even finding a place in arizona that serves dim sum is good enough for me. i like their beef tendons in curry a lot. some other steamed options, not so much. i dont know what they are doing or not doing but many of the dishes with a meat wrapped in a wrap, the wrap sticks to the container it is served in. when you try to grab it, the wrap tears and all the meat falls into the container before your mouth. i am also chinese, and i love how they automatically assume i can not speak their language right off the bat.... i heard every word you said about me!"}
{"text":"The dim sum at phoenix palace is pretty good, we enjoyed everything.  I ordered something new in my book and that was the curry tendon- it was a bit chewy and was lacking the curry flavor but overall not bad.  My favorite part about dining here is when you sit down and all the ladies with their dim sum carts flock toward you!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Dim Sum this past weekend and supposedly this was the best option for Dim Sum in the Phoenix area so I had to check it out for myself. It was fairly crowded when I got there but I was still able to get a table quickly. I did notice a lot of Asian families dining in near my table which is probably a good sign. As for the Dim Sum I decided on getting the Har Gow, Shu Mai, and the sticky rice. Out of the three that I tried the sticky rice was my favorite, although even then I have had much better elsewhere. The Har Gow was just okay I thought and the Shu Mai was not very good, would probably pass on getting that next time.

Overall I would say that Phoenix Palace is an okay spot to get Dim Sum but mainly because there are not too many other options in the area. I did notice that they do takeout for Dim Sum which could be a good idea when I stop by in the area next time. The service here I would say is typical of other Dim Sum restaurants, although I would add that I did feel a bit rushed when dining in."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum restaurant in the valley! Food is not greasy, carts come by frequently, and service is great. Be prepared to wait a bit if you go during the high volume times on the weekend- but it's well worth the wait! We come here at least once a month... and when we're done eating, we hop over to LeeLee's market and the boba tea next door for some treats & shopping. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can here not knowing what to expect. I left full and happy. Many traditional items were on the menu as well as a few specialties. Make sure you get there early or you will have a long wait."}
{"text":"2 years can change a lot. I think the quality of their dim sum is deteriorating, so we don't go there anymore. We tried their dinner, and I can say it's only so-so. Not too bad, and definitely not delicious either. As for China King, last year we went there for a Chinese new year meal, and it was so bad that made my aunt really upset as she was the one who invited us to the gathering and paid the bill :o...on the 1st day of Chinese New Year!!!!"}
{"text":"Really not good at all. My wife and i brought the kids and were excited due to all the good yelp reviews. Every dish went from bland to plain bad. The service was good and the restaurant was clean but not one of the 4 dishes we ordered was any good and the main dish was plain bad. Will not return."}
{"text":"Came here for Chinese Dim Sum on New Years Day.  Luckily my friends and I arrived early because we were seated right away.  However when we were leaving, there was a HUGE wait out in the lobby as well as outside (where it was freezing!)  Props to those outside because I don't think I could stand the rain and the cold while waiting for food.
I love the concept of dim sum where they have all different kinds of food on push carts and just make their way around the restaurant and you order what you want from the cart.  It's relatively quick and easy and you always have someone stopping by with new food before you get to even finish your last plate!"}
{"text":"I would like to rate this place 5 stars for catering my wedding. The owner is really easy to talk to and he always tries his best to accommodate my requests. I got so many compliments on the food on my wedding day, thanks to Park and the whole crew of Phoenix Palace to be there from dust to dawn. I got a pretty good deal on wedding package, and also there are plenty of seafood in the main courses (lobsters/shrimps/scallops). Without Park and his crew, my wedding could have been incompleted. Thank you so much for such a great service and high quality entrees. 

Also, I have been a regular customer for their excellent dim-sums. Sauteed clams with jalapenos, chicken feet, steam buns, beef tripe, shrimp balls, gailan and their delicious desserts are recommended. Wow I just can't complain about anything about this place. Try them out you will believe me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They are closed for \"reconstruction \". Will give a proper review if we ever get inside."}
{"text":"We tried this place for dim sum a week ago on a Saturday. We got there a little after 11 and the wait wasn't bad at all. The carts are a little slow going around so pace yourself if you want to try everything. There was a cart for baked items, steamed items, congee, tripe, noodles, and then occasionally some random guy just carrying a tray of vegetables. The best things I tried were the baked bbq pork buns and baked custard buns. An honorable mention were the footballs and the cream puffs. The cream puffs were pretty standard but they make them in the shape of swans!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are travelers going to the Grand Canyon. Tempe is our first stop. We went there right after we landed. The food is very very good. Service is so so. But anyway I like it a lot."}
{"text":"First time at Phoenix Palace. I arrived for lunch at 11:30 on a Wednesday and there were six tables full. Before I even sat down, I was asked by the Dim Sum cart lady if I wanted some. Having never been here, I declined so I could see the menu. 

After five minutes, I'm glad for my decision. The lady offered neighboring tables the same. Her English was so bad that they were utterly confused about what they ordered. 

I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and an iced tea for $12.50. 

I added beef chow mein from another cart lady. 

The flavors of the chow mein were very good, with minimal oil but even less beef. In fact, there was no meat. 

The Kung Pao Chicken, which is a spicy dish, had zero spice aside from the dried peppers that were added at the end. 

My lunch came with a vegetable roll and steamed Gyoza, which were nice touches. The TV was playing judge Judy, which, I guess is what they like here. At least they had a tv!"}
{"text":"At first I only came here for dinner getting plenty of entrées but I really enjoyed the shrimp noodles and other lo mein items. Now I come only for dim sum for their wonderful shrimp & pork dumplings & rolls and I don't remember the names of the other items but it's so great and very affordable for large quantities."}
{"text":"I love the ginormous language barrier here. Bring your token Chinese friend, because asking what each thing is will lead into a 5minute banter back and forth trying to figure out what the hell each party is saying.

- \"excuse me can you say it in english?\"
- [server] \"I AM speaking english\"
- oh. shit.

Luckily, it only takes about 4 guesses and 6 people to decipher what she was trying to say. God. We are so whhhhhite.

But on to the food. Yelpers are right on the money, the very little money it costs us to eat here. With 6 people and no holding back on ordering everything (cause \"what the hell\" and \"we're hungry\") until we were going to explode, costs us $53.35. For you math-enthusiasts, that's about $11 per person, tip included.

And did we say we were exploding at the end of our meal? Like, \"I need to hold my food baby and care for it\" full. Like \"I need a nap, immediately\" full. 

So, you may ask (or maybe not, I'm not telling you what to do), why the 3 stars? Were the quality of food is just A-OK, tasty but nothing out of this world. We stick to the siu mai, pork dumplings, shai long bao, egg tarts and Chinese broccoli. My favorite dim sum dish (of all time) is the sweet bread bun filled with pork. They make it here with mostly sweet potato vs bbq pork.. which made it sweeter than it needed to be (and less meaty). My friends enjoyed the shrimp noodle dumplings and we thought the roasted veggies were nicely done- crunchy but with tons of flavor. Not the easiest thing to pick up with chopsticks though.

Of course, no one had the balls to try chicken feet. I don't get it. Its delicious, and has nothing to do with my foot fetish. Mostly. Sort of."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum with my family again.  Some reviewers say \"this is the best dim sum restaurant in Phoenix\"  -- this might be true, but it is nowhere close to the best dim sum I have eaten in my life.  People also say the service is bad and I would normally agree, but yesterday, I felt that we received decent service, other than the fact that some of the old ladies pushing the dim sum carts don't speak English and get irritated when you don't speak to them in Cantonese.  I think it is their problem is they cannot speak English -- especially in the USA.  Food was decent, but not outstanding; lacking in depth of flavor and appropriate seasoning.  For instance, pai quat was bland and tough; chow mein was dry and flavorless; wrinkled green beans had too much round onion and not enough garlic in the dish; and the chive dumplings were bland in taste; and the glutinous rice in lotus leaf was flavorless.  However, most of the other dumplings were OK as were the bao's.  I thought the tripe dishes were flavorful and well seasoned.  We also ordered a plate of Chinese roast pork -- I might be wrong here, but it looked like they boiled the pork belly to get it cooked and tender, then roasted it to crisp the skin.  I think this is how they did it since it did not look like the normally roast pork you see hanging in the BBQ meat case.  The meat part looked pale and rather \"whitish\".  Prices have gone up, and when I did not receive an itemized menu, I couldn't tell if it was totaled correctly.  I \"think\" I could have been charged that phantom service fee too.  I am not a big fan of this restaurant, but when my family wants dim sum, this is where we go."}
{"text":"This place used to be so great for dim sum, but lately the food has not been tasting so great. It is crowded as usual on a Sunday morning for brunch. The crispy pork tastes like it was cooked many days in advance. Huge chunks of pork and didn't even get the side salad that goes with the pork. The shumai is hard and has an eggy after taste. Same eggy after taste for the porridge too. Not returning for these reasons."}
{"text":"The best dimsum for AZ standards.  Lots of hot dishes and the carts come around often so you don't wait too long for your cravings to be met.  The staff are friendly and eager to get you full."}
{"text":"The food here is not bad, one of the most decent dim sum places in the Phoenix/Chandler area (which isn't saying much). I prefer this place to other dim sum places in the area because they're the only one that have chive dumplings (which I love :F). 

The main thing I don't like about this place is that I normally love xia jiao (also known as ha gao or shrimp dumplings) but their dumplings have a really strong meaty taste and I'm a pescatarian (the only type meat I eat is seafood) so the taste kind of puts me off their dumplings."}
{"text":"My default place to go for Dim-sum on weekend.  

The best dim-sum on the east valley.  China King is closed, but Phoenix Palace is a bit cleaner.

The take out counter is also great for getting a whole roasted duck/chicken and a few pastries."}
{"text":"Food was awful, service was really bad and they were really rude too. They took forever to bring our drinks and we kept asking for the menu too many times. we felt nauseous when we left, never going there again."}
{"text":"Dim sum anyone? Def check this place out. The food is on point and the experience makes it even more worth it. One of the owners, Sam, takes great pride in his work and the reputation of his establishment. It's very roomy I side but note that on the weekends and holidays this place is PACKED. The duck here is to die for....I love it so much they usually have a plate ready for me when I come in with my bestie who introduced me to this place. The dumplings all have different names that I haven't learned yet, but the staff is super friendly and speak English and Cantonese so they are able to help. I've come here with friends, on date night with my hubby, with my little one in small parties and large and have always had a good experience. Note that there is a lot on the menu. Sometimes the specials are in Cantonese or Mandarin, but they can give you a description of you're curious. Aside from dim sum you can also come here for sit down dinners and they are delish as well. The salt and pepper crab is worth every penny. A full crab slightly breaded and cooked with fried garlic...we had at least 4 curious tables near us and one finally gave in and asked what we were having. Note also that this is more of a traditional Chinese restaurant with a sprinkle of Chinese- American dishes. It costs a lil more but is worth it!"}
{"text":"I must say this is the best Dim Sum that I have ever have in my life and the best service at a Chinese restaurant I think I will ever get. The setup is typical as any other Chinese Dim Sum place but everyone from the hostess to waiter to busboy is friendly as can be.  

Everything is delicious and super fresh from chicken feet(urgh.....but according to my BFF Cathy it's great) to home made egg custard tart(best thing I have ever put into my mouth). 

Must try:
Ginger Tripe
Egg custard tart
Chicken feet
Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce( perfectly cooked both at the stalk and leaves with the right amount of oyster sauce....who could imagine veggie could be so good)
Sticky rice
Taro balls


Your tummy and taste bud would thank you.

Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Very efficient if at times pushy service which is not unusual for dimsum restaurants.  We were part of the first group in the restaurants so the carts hadnt ramped up.  What was surprising is that the first two carts driving one behind the other were packed with identical dishes.  It would have made sense if they travelled in different directions at least!

The basic food items like shumai, shrimp dumplings, pork ribs in black bean sauce were decent.  We also ordered a plate of chow fun which was good.  Decent dim sum, perhaps slightly more efficient than c-fu gourmet across the intersection."}
{"text":"Phoenix Place provided me with a solid Dim Sum experience. My girlfriend and I went for Sunday Brunch and ended up in a food coma afterwards. There is plenty of seating but it was very busy when we went, but that's pretty standard of a good Dim Sum spot. They had everything I was looking for, chicken feet, tripe, different cuts of pork. I wish I had room for some desert, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Great dim sum. Long wait, so come early, especially over the weekend. Can be confusing at first but don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. Good food but probably won't be back....."}
{"text":"I'm not used to this sort of restaurant. It's very big. I didn't receive a menu. They came by with carts full of hot food, and would write on your ticket if you wanted that food. It was an interesting experience. All the food was great, even if I didn't know what it was. I would recommend it, just for the sake of trying something new."}
{"text":"The food is nice, especially the siu mai & shrimp puff, I'm just really particular with the service, there are some who are nice & approachable, but most of the staffs are pushy & very impatient because we cant understand & we cant choose what to get from the cart. Will never come back here again."}
{"text":"At the present time, this is probably one of the best Dim Sum places in the area. When I mean area, I am referring to the far west valley, all the way to the far east valley, and all cities in between.

The only other one that came close was at the Chinese Cultural center, but that restaurant has since closed. The Great Wall, by Grand Canyon University, is still a good place, but it is sub-par in comparison to Phoenix Palace.

The tremendous variety of the food selection, the cleanliness and the atmosphere, and the attentiveness of the wait staff is superlative.

One of the things that bug me about Dim Sum places is having to wait for the cart, when we obviously have yet to be served. Once we were seated, the carts made a bee-line for us immediately. No waiting. No anticipation. No frustration trying to get the attention of the person pushing the cart. They just all showed up at one time, and we were enjoying the meal within 5 minutes of being seated.

It didn't stop there, however. The servers just kept coming with even more specialty dishes, and if we had a bigger appetite, we could've sampled each one of them as they looked delicious. However, we stuck with the standard fare, and were quite pleased.

We intend on going back there again this weekend, and we are going to try to sample the other dishes that we missed the last time.

All in all, a wonderful Dim Sum experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best dimsum I have had in the US.

The service was amazing. The food carts and bussers circle the dining room continuously and are there to drop off foodie pick up plates immediately. You can also ask for specific dishes if you need to. 

The food was excellent. They do not skimp on their items. All of the dimsum pieces were packed with meat and each dumpling was good for two large bites. The contents were juicy and flavorful. You can also choose from a few diffent flavors of hot tea, including oolong. A few of the dishes that were especially good were the stir fry noodles, Shanghai dumplings, and siu mai pork dumplings.

Lastly, I was amazed at the price. For two people with about six dishes and drinks, it was under $20. 

I definitely recommend Phoenix Palace Buffet for anyone looking for dimsum in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.

The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?

When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  \"oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill\"

I said forget it, keep it.

i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.

  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.

gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)

$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.

as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)

so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?

it's the chinese way i guess

back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.

will you forgive us? haha"}
{"text":"This is the most starz I can give this place I have been 8 or so times and it's always mediocre at best we walked in today and had the sweets cart pull up first shortly the next came the sticky rice and shrimp balls ok the usual and then........................... nothing for 10 or more minutes finally after having to ask for more the next cart shows up umm ok shrimp balls again ... ya they also had tripe, chicken feet. Shu mi and a few other Asian delicacy but not my cup of tea no baked hum bow , BBQ pork, veg balls , seafood long noodle thing .......  oh and all the 100 year old wait staff seemed really pissed off"}
{"text":"I usually go to a different, nearby Chinese restaurant for dim sum. But, somebody recommended Phoenix Palace to me instead, saying that it put the other place to shame. Uh, wrong! It's the exact opposite actually.

The selection of dim sum at lunchtime on a Tuesday was dismal. A handful of dishes, and they seemed quite unwilling to prepare anything they didn't have already in the cart. The items I did try were quite lacking in quality and flavor...although they did seem to be somewhat fresh (to their credit).

If you're looking for delicious dim sum--and a good selection of it--try someplace else. Phoenix Palace is not the place to go. I won't return."}
{"text":"Wild Dining had two tables for 15 members this past SAT at 11 AM. We had reservations, and Phoenix Palace was ready for us in the Main Dining Room as requested. Even better, we were near the kitchen, so we were surprised that they brought out so much of the \"good stuff\" right away! . Not only was this a flawless Dim Sum experience from a service standpoint, but I found several items which I'd never tried before. Every item was so flavorful and perfectly prepared! And, even though  it's summer, I got my Pu-Li tea! This event was as memorable as any Dim Sum I've enjoyed anywhere in the world, including old Hong Kong, where I had Yum Cha for 3-4 meals per day. The whole culinary adventure reconfirms our love of Phoenix Palace and reminds us of why this is the best in AZ!"}
{"text":"I love that this location serves dim sum via cart every single day, not just on the weekend. And they offer the full assortment, not some skimpy version of the weekend menu. 

On this particular visit, I was passing through Phoenix on my way home. Nothing like having a mean craving for dim sum in the middle of the week. 

I arrived before the doors even opened. Once in, I was swiftly seated and provided water. Within minutes, the first cart came around. I figured I would be the only person there for hours. But, no, not so. Groups started pouring in about 20 minutes later. By the time I left, there were numerous tables seated with larger groups. 

Now, we all know that it is impossible to eat dim sum solo. Like, ridiculous impossible! But I wanted my dim sum now! So, solo I went. This meant, of course, that I didn't get a chance to order as much as I would have preferred. 

I found that everything was absolutely fresh, and the portion sizes were a tad bit larger than I was accustomed. Nice but, again, I was trying to go for as many things as possible. In the end, I had five orders and wasn't able to finish off every bite of food. And there was a slight miscommunication over a special order, which was somewhat disappointing, but turned out to be OK. Thank goodness I am open to trying out different types of things. 

My recommendation -- go! You may have to wait a long, long time on the weekend for a table. But it will be well worth the wait. Just be sure to take a sizable group along with you so that you are able to try as many items as possible."}
{"text":"pros:
- huge variety of dimsum (especially on weekends)
- high quality meat
- yummy desserts

cons:
- metallic water
- some dishes are fresher than others

i've been pleased each time i've had dim sum here. i order mango custard buns, sesame seed balls with red bean paste, steamed barbeque pork buns, sticky rice, shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice noodles, and chow mein.

the mango custard buns are sweet and the bread is fluffy. it is topped with crispy coconut shavings, and makes the perfect dessert. the sesame balls are also great for dessert, as they have a crunchy outside and a sweet inside consisting of glutinous rice flour and red bean paste. the steamed barbeque pork buns are a favorite of mine, as they melt in your mouth and you can detect a hint of honey along with the nice pork flavor. the sticky rice has a bit of a bitter flavor but a great consistency, and has a fill of chicken and a piece of a hot dog in the middle. the shrimp dumplings have a bit too fishy a flavor for my taste but are otherwise good. the shrimp rice noodles didn't have this problem, and the sauce they were topped with had a perfect amount of salt and flavor. tastly, the chow mein was surprisingly flavorful and i loved the large amount of bean sprouts that were in it. 

my main complaint about this place was actually the water. it tastes pretty metallic, as if it had come straight out of the tap. otherwise, this place is great for dimsum. go on the weekends for the food carts and greatest variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have dim sum...so disappointed it was really just OK. Very clean and polite so just a 3"}
{"text":"The fact that Phoenix Palace only has a 3.5 Star rating here on Yelp makes me question all that I know to be true! I've had Dim Sum from Seattle to east of the Mississippi and have yet to find any that comes anywhere close to the deliciousness that is Phoenix Palace.

If not for the fear of criminal charges, I would hug and kiss each lovely woman pushing the butane warmed carts of amazingness.

My standout favorites include (please excuse my atrocious Chinese spelling):

Har goa
Shu Mai
Char siu
Shrimp egg roll
Chinese brocolli
Salt and pepper squid
Fried lobster if the planets align and you're lucky enough to get it.

Jews know their Chinese food, and trust this Jew when I tell you that this is the real deal, mind altering Dim Sum."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for lunch looking to try something different. We knew it would be a bit awkward for us gringos walking into a place that is geared towards Asians with foul hanging in the window.

To be seated we were asked if we were there for lunch or dim sum, we said lunch and were escorted to the cheap seats.

Upon viewing the menu, I realized there were virtually no vegetarian options. The only thing I saw was the fried tofu.  The included egg drop soup was not vegetarian either.  

When my meal finally came, it was not what I expected. It was basically nine battered and fried pieces of tofu with rice on the side. Despite looking quite good, the batter was devoid of any flavor, and the tofu was extremely soft which was not the ideal texture. 

This meal was not too cheap either and I left hungry. At least for lunch this is far from being on my list of places to go.

PS this is not a buffet despite the name"}
{"text":"Their dim sum used to be really good but lately it has been very hit or miss - with more misses quite often. We came a couple weekends ago and waited about 30 minutes for a table but the food was very good and fresh. We stopped in this morning again and got seated right away. Unfortunately, this time the food was not fresh, which is a huge no-no for dim sum. The dumpling wrappers were chewy and we got completely cold shrimp egg rolls (which are very delicious when they are hot & crispy!). 

Unfortunately our dim sum options in AZ are very limited, so I keep coming back hoping I'd catch them on a good day. Next time, if there is no wait, I will go elsewhere. I don't mind waiting for a table to receive fresher food."}
{"text":"Friends from Cave Creek area were craving for some good  Chinese food and this is where we took them last night or took us since they paid for dinner.  Nothing fancy, but good American Chinese staple such as Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken, Stir Fried Chinese Broccolli, Seafood Chowmein and Walnut Shrimp.  We have a thing about Family Style Dinner with lazy susans and they have it here. 
 For all that food that fed 4 adults and 3 kids with to go boxes was $57!  Can't beat that.  Complimentary hot tea is wonderful this time of the year.  The ingredients was fresh.   I don't know if they have a separate Chinese Menu.  No KID'S MENU, but there are several choices of noodle dishes to chose from.  The dim sum is decent, there's not much choices when we went on a weekday.  I assume they'd have more on the weekend.  We liked China KIng's Dim Sum, much better, but enjoyed the food off the menu at Phoenix more.
This is an overall clean and consistent place to go and take your family to.

Oh, yeah, it's not a buffet!  I guess they used to be and never changed the name."}
{"text":"Of the dim sum places in Chandler this one tastes authentic but if you go on a weekday, options are very limited and you have to order the item which takes 15 mins. By that point I'm done eating. But if you go on a weekend you will get trampled by Asians. This place is too packed on Sundays. Service it terrible because no one speaks english and when you tell them no they continue to talk to you in chinese still trying to hustle you in to why you should get the item. I will say I get violent diarrhea every time I go. I don't know if it is the amount of grease or just food storage and preparation. Needless to say, this isnt one of my favorites but if I have to I will."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, and it took over 2.5 hours to get to me because the woman could not find my apartment. After 1.5 hours, I was calling on the half hour to see what had happened. They told me the deliverywoman was \"on her way,\" that she was \"at my apartment complex\" and then finally, at 2.5 hours, they told me she could not find my apartment number. If they would have let me know that much earlier, I could have given better directions; none of my other delivery folks seemed to have that kind of trouble and my complex isn't *that* big. I asked them why they didn't have her call me and have me help her find me, but they couldn't explain. Finally, as I was putting on my shoes and coat to get some food elsewhere, she showed up at the door. 

They didn't charge me for the food, which was good, because it was cold anyway!

Once I reheated the food, it was really great. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Kung Pao Shrimp. 

I will try them again sometime, but not delivery."}
{"text":"I used to live in Phoenix and ate here for Dim Sum or dinner all the time. Now that I live in Houston, I try to visit every time I go back to Phoenix. The food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the service is always friendly and efficient. What a great place for a meal by yourself or with friends and family. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best dim sum I have ever eaten. 

Phoenix Palace is a dim sum place, meaning it is exactly what you might expect - lots of carts pushing around delicious food, huge tables, and an energetic but nice atmosphere. You feel excited and energized being here, which I like. There are lines running out the door here, but service is fast, so the wait is never bad. 

The food is superb. Everything I tried - from the bao to the glutinous rice - was tasty and perfectly cooked. The spare ribs were excellently seasoned. I highly recommend the coconut buns, which basically blew my mind. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Lots of trolleys with Dim Sum onboard. Go early or else there will be a long wait. Try the bread stuff. Very soft and flakey. Good stuff. 

Dim sum is made fresh every time. Siew mai, jar kaow, Kai Keok (chicken feet in canton) and other Chinese dishes. All yummy."}
{"text":"BEST DIM SUM IN ARIZONA without the ridiculous 1 hr wait outside. 
The food arrives hot, every time, all appropriate plates.  They have lots of different plates, not just the usual shumai, etc.  You will find the most variety here.  The flavor is savory and good, not bland.  
They never run out of food. 
Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Growing up in SoCal where dim sum is known to be some of the best in the United States, I came to Arizona not expecting a whole lot from their dim sum scene. I was right as Phoenix Palace can't compare to dim sum in Cali. Their chicken feet tasted stale and did not have the tender quality of the skin that I enjoy. Their beef as well as shrimp rice noodles were of poor quality as I could not taste the flavors of the meat and seafood. Their BBQ pork bun wasn't too bad, but did not have enough of the BBQ flavor that I normally taste. Their fried turnip cake lacked any savory flavor and was too plain. Their duck egg and minced pork porridge was too watery which overpowered the egg and pork flavors. Their Gai Lan with oyster sauce was decent, about the only thing I felt was passable. It was almost empty the 2 times that I came, once on a weekday afternoon and once on a weekend morning, so service was friendlier and more efficient because there was no busy rush for the staff."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food dinner with massive portions. When our usual Pho spot closed for New Year's, we trotted into Phoenix Palace for our first dinner of 2014.

The three of us opted for the Mandarin Dinner (family style): Hot & Sour Soup, Fried Crab Puff, Egg Roll, Pot Sticker, and one entree for $13.95 per person. We tried to substitute for egg drop soup, or anything else, but the language barrier and seemingly restaurant policy kept us from the substitution. Nevertheless, we were not disappointed.

Hot & Sour Soup: Served in a huge bowl, the consistency was more like a stew. Great flavor and not too spicy, though it heats up.

Fried Crab Puff, Egg Roll, Pot Sticker - enough for at least one per person, we had leftovers of crab puffs and pot stickers. Very flavorful with quality ingredients. I could have munched on these for dinner but had to save room!

Sweet & Sour Chicken - large chunks of white meat in a sweet glaze that's sticky enough for a full coating of rice. My favorite of the three we ordered.

Beef and Broccoli - tasted good and overall above average. Again, a large enough serving to feed a group of 3.

Kung Pao Chicken - not as good as the others. I'd go with something else next time. The chicken pieces were smaller than I'd like and it seemed like the flavor was too blended, like you couldn't tell what you were eating except for the spice. It wasn't bad, just not the best.

It's a good sign when all of the staff and patrons speak the language of the cuisine. Phoenix Palace is quite authentic and has a great assortment of dishes. I will return to try others, especially their dim sum."}
{"text":"For the price, I'd say the dim sum is standard, nonetheless still delicious. I would recommend takimg a friend here for breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"The dim sum was ok.  Not great, but ok.  The spring rolls were fantastic, some of the best ever.  Not too much to say since it wasn't an exceptional experience."}
{"text":"It's good, better know what u want our ya ganna wait for ever.  the cool thing about this place is they come around and Check up on you. Customer service  is greatm food is well its dim sum. You won't know an tell you try it"}
{"text":"This place charges a cover fee. When we brought it up to the owner, they said a lot of places do it and that it covers for utensils, cleaning off the tables and Togo containers. I go to tons of dim sum and I've never heard of this! Then he said it was for the hot tea or water that they bring. I was never offered hot tea! This is a joke!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit for dim sum here in the Phoenix area. It's best to come early, not only to beat the crowds but also to ensure you get to enjoy the full range of dim sum dishes. Sometimes if you come later not all of the carts are still out. There are lots of varieties and its very easy to order. Even for someone not fully familiar with dim sum cuisine eats super easy to ask to see the dish and point. If you need further clarification each server carries a list of the dishes they are carrying in both Cantonese and English. 

My favorites are the steamed pork buns, the shrimp and scallop dumplings, and the egg custard buns. Really everything we've had here is pretty tasty. Its nice to be able to order at any pace you want. I often sit for a little bit and then get ready for some more chow and order again. 

Prices are affordable- about 20 per person, service pretty good- although I frequently want for water, and food always tasty. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I've eaten dim sum in a lot of places. From fancy pants restaurants to hole in the walls. Even frozen dim sum from your freezer. Never once did I question wtf was I eating I came here. Seriously this may pass off as dim sum to those who eating it for the first time. Now given the positive, they had a couple dishes that were good. Hence the two stars instead of one. But simple common fare such as har gow or siu Mai was butchered. Siu Mai tasted like beef balls you get in Vietnamese pho and the texture of the har gow wasn't better than something you get in the frozen section. All the food came out like warm and not steaming hot like it was fresh of the steamer. Don't waste your time here if you love dim sum."}
{"text":"This is my new FAVORITE Chinese  food place. Very affordable and very consistent in food quality and service. Located in the Lee Lee's Asian Market Center, I notice many Asian families at this restaurant .  I believe I may be addicted to their Assorted Wonton soup, filled with pork, shrimp, chicken, veggies and lots of meaty won ton dumplings. I ask them to make spicy for me and they accommodate . 
Moo-shu (sp?) pork is also one of my favorite dishes here. They also have a Take out deli with prepared to-go items. I am always very pleased when I dine here at Phoenix Palace. Not too fancy, very friendly. Clean."}
{"text":"Awesome place for dim sum. Moved here two years ago and we have gotten consistent good food. Dim sum is very hard to find a place that knows what they are doing. My caution try to pace your self. My wife loves to point at too many items when the carts roll by. Better to eat them hot. 
If you order the duck or roast pork to go make sure you call in advance to make sure they have some. It can sell out."}
{"text":"Yes!!! I am coming back here and recommend this to all you dim sum cravers and Asian tourists. The last couple of years when I visited Arizona, all I could find to eat were either  Vietnamese pho or Chinese. Now I can say that I've tried dim sum in Arizona! 

Yelped this place out and it was hard to choose from China King or Phoenix Palace but I had to make a quick choice because we wanted to eat and back to California so here we were, at phoenix palace.

Phoenix palace is located in a plaza filled with other Asian stores. It's actually across from LA fitness if you end up being in that plaza instead of the actual plaza (we got lost trying to find this place haha) 

Waiting? Ah yes... There was 10 minute wait but hey, better than 40 minute wait like the dim sum's back in Cali. That 10 minute went by quick. We did come here on a Saturday around noon, so the wait was nothing. Let the hostess or host know how many in your party, grab a number then wait for them to call it to be seated. 

Service? Hey! These ladies here who pushes carts knows English very well. Will know what kind of dim sum you are looking for if you, yourself know what you want and know what the dim sum contains. Quick with clearing out our empty dishes on the table, which is great!

Food? Liked it a lot. There were four of us and we got...

- fried squid (special order) yums. There's minced fried garlic, sliced jalapeño  and minced green onion. Eat it while it's hot! We all know how fried stuff would taste if we leave it out too long.

- Chinese brocolli with oyster sauce - it was our friend's favorite veggie. Good stuff. Still got it's crunch and not soggy! Awesome

- Seaweed - it's like a seaweed salad with pickle-ish underneath, and thinly sliced ginger hidden inside the seaweed which made it tasted even better. 

- sticky fried rice - there's eggs, Chinese diced sausages, minced dried shrimp and minced mushroom. tasted okay, but just needed a dash of soy sauce to taste better.

- sticky rice wrapped with lotus leaf or could be banana leaf - delicious. inside contains slices of shitaki mushrooms, dried shrimps and a chunk of Chinese sausage which made it tastes so good.

- shrimp paste on bell peppers - Light gravy sauce which was good. Have the lady cut it in half so you can share :)

Overall, this dim sum place is more than just legit. With the great service they provided, I will be coming back for their dim sum and on the next visit, I will try more of their special dishes! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Saturday morning around 11:00 am.  The restaurant wasn't too busy at that time but it was pretty packed by the time that we finished eating.  

There's a good variety of dim sum items available.  Prices are reasonable.  We had the shrimp dumplings, lotus leaf rice, barbeque pork buns, pork and shrimp dumplings, tofu skin roll, chicken feet, tripe, beef balls, rice noodle rolls, and savory stuffed dumplings.  The food was decent flavor-wise but the downside was that everything was only lukewarm except for the savory stuffed dumplings.  We got the savory stuffed dumplings towards the end of our meal.  Had we started eating a little later when the restaurant was busier, we probably would have had hotter food since there would be higher turnover.  My favorite dishes were the savory stuffed dumplings, tripe, shrimp dumplings, and lotus leaf rice."}
{"text":"Dim Sum also known as \"yum cha\" in Cantonese, I say this would be the most difficult Chinese cuisine to prepare. Not everyone can make them at home or they require all day and the right tools; so usually most Chinese rather go to a restaurant who serves Dim Sum. I have tried most of the Asian restaurants who serve Dim Sum and so far Phoenix Palace live up to the quality. The servers are always friendly and helpful when we request special orders. One of the reasons we choose here for family gatherings or celebrate special occasions."}
{"text":"Pretty good but I wouldn't say it was anything exceptional. Ordered quite a few dishes that I can't honestly remember now!"}
{"text":"The dim sum is good,  not great.  The Bbq selection is average,  the duck is ok and roasted pork is average.  The bean cured and sumai is good and is one of the few great items.  Overall it is good for Arizona,  nothing compared to CA."}
{"text":"Loved this place!

Excellent service, delicious food, clean and spacious! 

Definitely will go back. My friends and I went on Saturday for a brunch and we thought it would be overly crowded but it wasn't at all. From what I was told, they recently renovated so maybe not many people know that it's open again? Lucky for us, it was spacious with great service. 

Everything we tried was delicious. All the dumplings were good and I don't remember the names of everything. I suggest you go with a large group so that you can try everything! My favorite is the Shumai and lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice. Their chicken feet, beef tendon, and tripe were delicious too. Didn't smell bad at all like some places. Be adventurous and try them :)"}
{"text":"Good stuff here!!!  We've been going to Phoenix Palace for about 3 years.  Although they are not up to a Yank Sing level, they are about the best in town for the Phoenix area.  AND, they have soup dumplings!  Love soup dumplings. . .

Great service, my daughter and I arrived early and we almost had to hide under the table when all the steam carts converged on our table.  Looked like bees around a hive.  Everything we ordered was flavorful and hot. 

Take away is great too.  We often phone in a Sunday order and enjoy a tableful of Shu Mai, Har Gow, and about a dozen other delicious dumplings and plates.  BBQ pork is excellent, as are the Shrimp rolls.

Enjoy"}

She does a great job of talking you through everything that is happening and pinpointing what factors might contribute to your condition and giving you solutions. I had an amazing experience and recommend her to anyone with any issues big or small!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Dim Sum. Its not knock your socks off but where is in Phoenix? The service is spotty. You'll get five carts in five.minutes.and then not see one for thirty minutes. Some poor guy in the restroom had a bad accident and that was rough. Not their fault but it didn't appear to be the cleanest restroom already."}
{"text":"When I hear the words dim sum my ears perk up much like a dog when he hears someone approaching. Then a certain caution sweeps over me since so many dim sum places around the valley don't even come close to those found in other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. So when a friend of mine and local ice cream guru, Helen Yung from Sweet Republic, told me about a new dim sum joint that reminded her of Hong Kong, I was elated to try it as soon as possible.

Phoenix Palace is quickly becoming a jack of all trades sort of restaurant. During the week they have seafood and Chinese buffets, a full menu with free delivery, and on the weekends rolling cart dim sum as well as a take out BBQ section. While carts only roll on the weekends, dim sum can be ordered any day of the week off of a smaller menu. We came just for the weekend cart dim sum, the BBQ section in the front of the restaurant looked amazing. In the window wrapped onto stainless steels hooks were selections of whole roasted duck, pork spare ribs and roasted chicken. I haven't seen a display like this one since being in Chinatown in San Francisco a few months back, very impressive. Come early or call ahead if you want to enjoy a roast duck to-go, when we left the display was pretty much wiped out.

Walking into the Phoenix Palace you'll immediately notice that you're not in Kansas anymore, the clientele is mostly Asian who have very discerning palates. You know you're in the right place when the target market is ethnic and not American. No worries about communication break down, the staff speaks English, even if it is a little broken. Though all you really need are your senses to guide you through the dim sum experience. After being sat, the carts will start rolling by your table to peddle their vast variety of dumplings. Each cart person will open a steam basket for you to take a look inside and along with a brief explanation, usually consisting of only one word, they stamp your tally card and move on. The carts don't come in any sort of order so just have fun and order away. If something looks even remotely good go ahead, it's really inexpensive.

One of the main difference between Phoenix Palace and the other dim sum restaurants, is the fact that not only do they offer 75+ different items, but here it's not only fresh but made in house. One of the carts that come about is a fry cart which at first seemed unusual. It's a stainless steel ride with a built in cook top where some items are crisped and heated table side which made perfect sense after one bite. In all of the places I've had dim sum, here and in other cities, I have never seen or heard of this before. Helen told me that she hadn't seen something like that since having dim sum in Hong Kong. If Helen is impressed, I'm blown away! We started with an order of Green Leek Gow ($3.15), with a translucent skin showing a silhouette of diced leeks and chopped shrimp, then crisped up on either side for a textural symphony. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Bun ($3.15) which had a slightly crisped edges filled with tender chopped pork, each bite was simply sublime. These were so good we ordered an additional plate of those chubby meat filled pillows.

The standards are done extremely well here, such as the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($2.15), as well as the baked version ($2.15) with its covering of sweet sticky glaze. If you've never experienced a BBQ Pork Bun in either incarnation, you really should. This is the all about savory, salty and sweet, dip in some chili paste for an added spicy dimension. Chinese Broccoli ($5.25) is slightly bitter, slightly sweet and has a crunchiness that pairs well with the softer noodle dishes like the Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($3.15). Long sheets of rice noodles are filled with sliced tender beef, rolled and then steamed. When delivered to your table, a lightly sweetened soy sauce is poured over the top. Shui Mai ($2.15) is as tender and flavorful as it was meant to be, porky and delicious.

Dessert dim sum is as much fun as its savory counterpart. Sesame Balls ($2.15) filled with sweetened red bean paste, surrounded by sticky rice, then rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried were pretty much a crowd pleaser. The Snow Bun ($2.15) was a new one that I've never seen or tasted before. A cloud of pure heaven filled with creamy custard, served warm, blew away any doughnut that's graced my lips. I also ordered a box of them to-go so they could be enjoyed again later. The tall and billowy Brown Sugar Rice Cake ($2.15) reminded me more of a yellow cake though was very good, hot and fresh out of the steam basket.

There aren't too many places where you can try so many different textures and flavor in one sitting. So it really is an experience to have dim sum with a close group of pals because food always seems to bring us just a little bit closer."}
{"text":"First dim sum place I have tried in the area so I cannot compare to other. However, compared to other dim sum restaurants in the SF Bay Area, it could hold its own.

Good variety, food came out nice and hot. One of the servers pushing the food carts even told us which selections were hot and fresh versus a older and cooled off. Each dish had its own proper flavor meaning not all the dishes tasted the same which some places do. 

Although, I must add the comment that their selection is a bit limited, but heh, it's Tempe, AZ not San Francisco, CA.

Overall service was quick and courteous; I would say a bit better than your typical Chinese servers. I would come again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"If you like Dim Sum you must come here when in Phoenix. Lots of types of Dim Sum, boiled,  fried,  sweet, salty, veggies, and all come to your table. It was pretty crowded and had a 15 to 20 min wait. As other Dim Sum places, it is busy and noisy. They serve take out two."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it's usually our go to place for Dim Sum. I like to go to this place since their service is faster than the other dim sum places in the Valley. The line is not as bad.

The service is pretty good here.  They are steady with the pushing carts, has varieties of food selections and the prices are pretty decent.  I would say their egg custard and the BBQ buns are pretty fresh and always good here.  The shu mai and steamed pork are good as well.  We usually always request for chow mein and Chinese bread since it is usually not on the cart and it's my kids favorite.

Overall, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was a long drive from Cave Creek, but we wanted dim sum!  Arrived mid-afternoon Sunday and there were HOARDS milling around outside restaurant.  That was bad.  Good news was mostly Asian, so we felt that indicated some good eats and worth the wait.  But there was very little wait.  They have a great system---despite the numbers, we were seated within 10 minutes.  

The dim sum carts came around at the perfect intervals and we hardly passed up a one, so I can't even tell you what-all we had, except it was uniformly hot and good.  The dim sum ladies didn't have a lot of English, but mostly they could explain what the dish(es) were on their carts, and if not---what the heck, right?  

It was just so much fun, and we ate and ate and ate and still ended up with a super-reasonable bill.  We will totally plan another road trip to Chandler and Phoenix Palace---and it's the perfect opportunity to stop in at Lee-Lee's International Market to pick up some exotic stuff for the pantry!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of dimsum--Richmond, Toronto, Seattle. This has no comparison, but it is still dimsum to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"If you've been to an authentic Dim Sum restaurant, Phoenix Palace is a great 2nd placer, although not my top choice. Those pushing around the carts are so friendly and their dishes are fairly good, although sometimes can seem old like they've been out a while. The customer service is impeccable though! I love that my friends and I can ask the waiters and waitresses in both Mandarin and Cantonese exactly what we'd like. This place is good for the family and great for larger parties! I haven't explored other Dim Sum restaurants in the greater Phoenix area, but this isn't a bad start."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been introduced to Dim sum via some foodie friends.   
The name is deceiving as it's not a buffet, they wheel around carts with tons of food variants on them and you choose what you want off the cart - they write on your ticket... you eat... good deal.

So I don't know half of the stuff I ate but it was all good with the exception of some pork balls I had a slight issue with the texture... I'm a white guy from the midwest, never had this stuff before, give me a break lol.

I do, however remember the Snow Mountain Rolls I believe they were called?  Sugary pastry with a very good creme filling... kind of like a creme-filled doughnut but not :/  Super good tho.

Dumplings... they were awesome, and also a safe bet if you don't know what to get.  I'd go back but only with foodie friends that help me decide what to eat :)

Also... a table of 5 ate for like 50 bucks... that surprised me greatly with the amount of food we had on the table... to the point there wasn't any room left!"}
{"text":"good food always crowded worth the wait"}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation and okay reviews, we recently gave Phoenix Palace a try.  Got there on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm.  The place was very busy and Dim Sum carts were everywhere.  The Dim Sum cart ladies were blunt and unfriendly to us and the nearby tables; not to mention they were pushy with their fellow cart colleagues.  One actually shoved her coworker's cart right out of the aisle with her cart and headed to the next table to sell her food.  As customers finished their meals and started leaving, the carts never came by our table again until we made a specific request. 
In addition to the poor service, the food wasn't nearly as good as other Dim Sum places in the area.  The food we received was fine, but the selection was surprisingly dismal & quite limited, and special orders took well over 20 minutes.  
First time I've left a Dim Sum restaurant feeling hungry.  Won't be back and can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"(Lyric - Janet Jackson - Love Will Never Do (Without You))
Phoenix Palace I have tried before
To replace as my Dim Sum place
Never did I have a doubt
It's Dim Sum I can't do without

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've eaten in the past
That hunger will always be without you

Phoenix Palace I have tried before
To replace as my Dim Sum place
Never did I have a doubt
It's Dim Sum I can't do without
I feel better after a meal with you
Cause no other place around
Has quite the same Yum Yum (ha ha ha!)
Like you do do do do...

Phoenix Palace is an old school Dim Sum joint located in the heart of what I call little Chinatown.  Off Dobson and Warner this little corner in Chandler is a mecca for Asian businesses, aside from your LA Fitness on the Northwest corner.  Phoenix Palace is in the same corner as Lee Lee's Market; where you can explore all food ingredients from the Orient.  

I'm a dim sum lover and I wish I could go every weekend, but that would totally destroy my diet!  Needless to say, Phoenix Palace is one of my favorite dim sum places in Phoenix.  They offer up some traditional products like Siu Mai, Nai Wong Bao, Phung Chows, and Cha Sui Baos.  Moreover, they also have some newer products and I gather it's for the more American guest like fried noodles, fried rice and calamari.  All good, but some times I wish they would just stick with tradition.  

Overall, the dim sum is pretty good and one of the best in my opinion of what we can get in Phoenix.  It'll get the job done as they say, but don't expect it to blow your mind away.  Service here has improved through the years and afterwards you can always stop by Lee Lee's to get your Asian groceries.  Just a skip and a hop away is a Boba place so you might as well get your entire Asian fix on and done! - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Lunch yesterday.

First time eating Dim Sum.  First time for both of us.  After we figured it out it was fun picking out little steamers or plates of dumplings.  Most everything was flavorful and tasty.

Just one thing I didn't care for, it had yuca in it... but it was just my taste... not the quality of the food.

I would love to come back and have a larger group... that seems like a lot of fun and a good way to try lots of food!  

I do want to try the chicken feet.  The sauce looked really good!

Staff was informative but maybe a little impatient for first timers.

Anyway, we ate a TON and I was full to the gills - as my gramma would say :o)

If you haven't tried it, you should... did I say it was \"fun\"?"}
{"text":"We come here all the time. No real issues just the usual which is the wait during the weekend for dim sum.
Tip is when your going to Dim Sum be prepared to be aggressive in order to get attention or you will be waiting ha ha. I gave a 4 because of some staff and good food!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food place because everyone talks in Chinese. There's mostly Americanized Chinese food, but they taste pretty good so I'll give it a pass.

We ordered a Mandarin dinner with 8 plates. The apps were decent... usual egg roll and crab puffs. The wonton soup was very bland. Moo shuu was probably the most delicious thing they served. The kung pao chicken, moo goo gai pan, beef with broccoli and shrimp dish gets a decent pass. The squid was also kind of lacking. There was a spicy pork dish and a dish I can't remember the name of that tasted pretty good. Overall, the entire meal didn't disappoint. 

And the service was nice as they kept filling out tea, water and rice. And then packed out to go boxes and everything. When it comes to Chinese restaurants, I'm usually harsh but this place did just enough things right to get the four stars."}
{"text":"This had so much potential, but alas, all the hype I heard about this place was not true. The dim sum itself is not spectacular. It's about as good as most other places I've been, but the selection wasn't very diverse. Maybe we went too early and not everything was out yet. It seems like that's the catch 22: either you arrive early to beat the crowd but have to wait for the good food, or you come later when the food is all ready but you have to wait forever to get seated. Actually, I'm not sure if we were too early for the good stuff or if they good stuff just never came our way; the hostess had seated our group all the way in the back, away from everyone else when the restaurant wasn't even close to being full yet. Seemed like a rather racist decision on their part because my group was predominantly non-East Asians. 

Now that I think about it, the service was definitely bad enough to warrant a two-star rating. The ladies pushing the carts were really terse with me. I was ordering everything in Mandarin (because that's the only Chinese I speak) but since people in my group had dietary restrictions, I had to ask about the filling for the different types of dumplings and bao that went by. The ladies got really annoyed about me asking and were pretty rude. They also seemed angry when I asked for four boxes (one for each person) and rejected the two big boxes they initially handed me (even though I had asked for four small boxes to begin with). 

Food-wise, it was okay. I've had better had other dim sum places, but my favourite dim sum restaurant in the valley closed, so this is kind of all I'm stuck with. Still, I feel bad for having brought my friends here to try it out. All the good stuff I heard about this place just aren't at all true. Disappointing, to say the least."}
{"text":"OMG, this place was packed, and the Dim Sum was delicious with quite the array of funky stuff (this is always a good thing when it comes to Dim Sum).  Those carts were blasting through the crowd, and the incredible mishmash of all that one could find if there was an explosion involving a dollar store, a Christmas outlet, and a Halloween store, but not lacking the bargain bin at the used flooring and counter outlet.  There were Christmas trees, silk flowers galore, 16 different light fixtures, 20 different flooring's, hanging stuffed animals, and all sorts of craftiness that should have never been put on the shelves to sell, little lone ever sold.  It was filled with Asians and that's all I needed to see, to know that I had landed in Nirvana, this was my 3rd time there and I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Dimsum is just okay. Thats all i can say since ive always ordered To Go."}
{"text":"I love dim sum.

This place has all the regular stuff plus their own creations.  All of the items we tried were great.

It's a delicious and inexpensive place to enjoy a weekend meal with friends.

My favorite dish is the chicken feet!"}
{"text":"Is it the best? No. Is it consistent? Yes. If they don't have the item in the dimsum cart, they're willing to make it for you without giving you grief. Never had dinner here so I can't comment on that but am willing to try in the future."}
{"text":"Okay, I know Chinese restaurants are not known for their cleanliness but what happened today is really a new low for me.  The dim sum lady put a plate of beef rice roll on the table.  It was fresh so that was good.  It was not cut but I was fine with that.  She proceeded to cut it with her scissors.  Since there was no soy sauce on it yet, I noticed that her scissors left all these black specks in the rice rolls.  I told her the scissors were dirty but she continued to try and pick the specks off WITH her scissors!  It only made it worse.  I told her I don't want that plate anymore and she said no, I can't return it.  I was about to ask for the manager until she finally took it back and off my bill.  She put that plate back on the cart, now with soy sauce.  Onto the next customer?!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 sets of baked pork bun (char siu bao) total of 9 buns.  The first two, I took two bites each without tasting any of the char siu pork.  After my family ate their share we all agreed the there might have been only 1/2 teaspoon of filling each.  Phoenix Palace sure are stingy with their filings and lack quality.  Time to find another place for dim sum."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best dim sum I've had in Arizona...... Nowhere near Cali standards..but when the husband and I need a dim sum fix, this is the place we go to! Haven't tried their dinner... So can not speak about that!"}
{"text":"They serve diversity dim-sum. I love all of them! I think this is the best dim-sum place in Arizona.  I'm not from the southeast China, so this is my best personal experience."}
{"text":"Phoenix palace is a great place to buy duck from.  Their Chinese food is also pretty delicious as well. Why I love going here on the weekends is for the dim sum.  I would recommend going here for their dim sum."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I had passed it a million times, but never made the connection of the name to the location because of my drive route. Very authentic joint, and the food and preparation and presentation was Chinatown-authentic. My only disappointment was that I missed dim sum by a few hours and no matter how much I pleaded, I could not get any dim sum. However, the hostess told me she'd be happy to accommodate my dim sum jones Sunday morning (emoji)."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe on my last day in Arizona I finally find a dim sum restaurant!! I could've been dining here the whole time! Food was delicious. Atmosphere is great. And service is good!! Would come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible today, i couldn't believe how the waitress who was pushing the dim sum dishes around was out of one of the dishes and told us to order. So i grabbed the waitress busing the tables to order and she gives me one of the worst attitudes telling me it's cooking right now it will be out shortly. I knew that the next batch was going to run out  and what do you know as soon as the cart was filled and got to us they ran out. Then they had the nerve to ask if we wanted to place an order after . Wow that just topped it."}
{"text":"Got seated immediately. The cart rolled on over to us right away. We were starved and ready to get our dim sum cravings satisfied. The food was nice and hot. Taste was just right. The workers who push the carts were nice but can be too pushy on what you want to get sometimes. We went pretty early and it got busy fast! On the bill, it did charge for \"2 people\"? I don't know why...? Weird. Overall, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Just for a change of routine on a Sunday morning my family and I went with Phoenix Palace rather than C-fu. 
Hubby ordered Duck Beaks and said \"Now I can say I've done that and can now cross it off my bucket list\". 
The usual dim sum fare--which is great--but we didn't see anything that unusual nor different from dim sum places (except the duck beaks). But do try the turnip cakes! I recommend them highly. 
C-fu still makes better congee and curried tripe though."}
{"text":"The service is so bad here!  The dim sum is ok.  It takes forever to get them to come to the table for more Dim Sum.  I rather go to other local places for Dim Sum"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the Dim Sum.  Went there on a Saturday afternoon and man o man, it is packed to the gills!  Thank goodness we made a reservation for 18 and requested to seat in the main dinning room.  

The dim sum carts were flying all over the aisles.  Some carts will stop by to ask what you like and some fly by without getting you a chance to see what is available.  We had so many dishes, so I will only comments on the ones that I remember.

Pros:
Lai Bak Go (Taro Fried Cakes) - Warm, perfected fried on both sides, and tasty
Shu Mai (Dumplings) - Pretty large sizes, good taste, and warm
Char Sui Bao (Steamed BBQ Pork Buns) - BBQ was flavorful and steamed perfectly
Pork and Preserved Egg Rice Soup - OMG, good!!!
Gar Lear (Fried Bread wrapped with flat rice noodles) - Crispy bread, soft noodles, and mixed with the perfect soy sauce mixture

Con:
Black bean with spare ribs - flavorless and oily
White Snow Buns - Deflated and undone

I need to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Ehh..definitely was not impressed with any dishes I ordered today! Maybe..just maybe the porridge. But even so, the food was ehhh."}
{"text":"Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for \"decent\".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!"}
{"text":"Sooo . . . I've been coming on and off to this place since it first opened and it has gone through several incarnations from buffet to sit down to something in betwn that I really wasn't sure what was being served when I opened their door this past Sat. 
Much to my pleasant surprise, the place was bustling serving dim sum a plenty.
And the place was packed with my kind of people (Chinese in case you're wondering. Haha) so I figured the dim sum must be pretty good. 
I was not disappointed. Everything I had was up to standard. I had 5 dishes plus got charged 65 cents for having water and the tea that was not served to me. 
When I questioned the 65 cents and told the owner I did not have tea, he pointed to a handwritten sign taped to the cash register hidden behind stacks of to go menus that said 65 cents charged to every customer for tea AND WATER. Okay, I didn't realize when I crossed the threshold I had been transported to China or Europe where they do charge for water. 
I also questioned an item where they charged me for a large item when I only had the small dishes and boy, did the owner insist on every penny!  Okay, dude I won't argue with you. So somehow for five dishes, water, and tea that I didn't get the bill came to a whopping $17 which I thought was freakin' expensive for dim sum at lunch time. When I saw the bill I almost wish I could have thrown up the food and return the dishes back to them. Alas, I couldn't and didn't so I paid my bill and left. 
Sigh, since dim sum has become trendy and popular I think it's driven up the price!  I remember when I could have 5 dishes for less than $10!  Oh, the good 'ole days!"}
{"text":"This review is just for the dim sum.

Frustratingly mixed experiences here, and when I consulted one of my true-blue Yelp buddies about this place, she said the same thing.  The first time that we came here, it was a Sunday around 1:30 - they were still doing a steady service of dim sum, but since they stop the carts around 3pm, the crowds had waned quite a bit.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table and were seated in the way back, which we didn't mind since it gave us space to chat and chill out.  We have a couple dim sum places back in my hometown of DC that I am out and out in love with, so I usually know exactly what I want when I go and judge most places by those standards.  Phoenix Palace made me pretty happy on that visit, serving just about all of the dishes that I crave - my husband and I plied our faces with as many dumplings from the steam cart as we could muster, roast pork with gorgeous crackling skin, the fried shrimp and chive dumplings that I seem to crave on a weekly basis, garlicky chinese broccoli and pliantly chewy baked pork buns, along with several other happy bites.  Although some of the dishes were lukewarm by the time they got to our table, we were still happy and chalked it up to coming to eat on the later side.  I'm sure that if we spoke Chinese, we may have been able to order the few things that we didn't see on the carts but had spied on their dim sum menu, but it wasn't a terribly big deal.  We definitely planned on returning.

Cue this weekend and I am jonesing for shu mai and har gow hardcore.  We make a trip to Phoenix Palace around noon on a Saturday and there is a crowd waiting in the front area.  No worries - the line at dim sum places usually moves quickly.  We see a mass of people waiting at the check in desk to get a number and the time seems to just tick by with no one coming to check anyone in.  Countless employees see no less than 20 of us waiting patiently and just walk away.  Finally, after 10 minutes of standing there, a Chinese couple flags down what seems to be a manager and he hollers at one of the girls to help out.  She briefly surveys the crowd and then walks off.  One of the few couples that already had a number and were waiting walks over to the take out desk to ask someone there for an estimate on when they'll be seated and are met with no response.  I gaze over at the folks pushing the carts around and they look haggard and a little depressed.  Although I really wanted to stay, I felt as though the universe was compelling me with all these signs of bad service to go eat elsewhere.  We bailed, but were bummed to do so.  I have mixed feelings as to whether we'll be back or not, given that we've had much worse service issues at many other places here in the Valley for a lot worse dim sum."}
{"text":"I went here for a late dinner. It was me and a couple of friends. We ordered half crispy chicken, beef and veggies, string beans, mongolian beef, and soup. Everything was really good especially the crispy chicken. Customer service was ok, took awhile to get refills on our drinks, but all in all in was good. I usually come here for dim sum because I think their dim sum is pretty good, better than most places I been to in AZ. So, if you are going to try this place, go for their dim sum first!"}
{"text":"My family came here almost every week for dimsum. Good food and good price."}
{"text":"Went with the family for some dim sum and wanted to see if Phoenix Palace had gotten better since our last visit. Ordered some shrimp egg rolls, har gao, shu mai, chow mein and Baked BBQ pork buns. The egg rolls were really oily, the har gao had an odd flavor to the shrimp, and the shu mai didn't taste meaty (more fatty). The Baked BBQ pork buns were good though. The worst dish I had was the chow mein. It was severely overlooked and had no \"dragon breath\" flavor to it. If it were only the dishes I might have just given them an update of 2 stars but their customer service was horrendous. 

Before we were seated my wife asked about an open table (4 seats) and why it was given to a party of 2 (we were a party of 3) that came after we did. All the person at the door directing people to tables said was WAIT A MINUTE in a very unapologetic and rude tone. When we were finally seated we waited a very long time before we even got our water. Many of the waiters and waitresses which we asked for water/tea either ignored us or just looked at us in disbelief. 

Would highly recommend you look elsewhere for dim sum, unless you want poor dim sum quality and rude service. Looks like our time away has just given Phoenix Palace he opportunity to get much worse."}
{"text":"Decent place to get dim sum. The quality of the food is good but not amazing. The cleanliness of the tables and surrounding was great and I was able to leave without smelling like fried food! I'd recommend this place to go out for a quick dim sum with friends and family."}
{"text":"Nice selection of Live seafood . Salt and pepper Crab was so great we ordered another one."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is the best.  The shu Mai dumplings and shrimp dumplings are good but if you're more adventurest, try the tasty chicken feet and the delicious tripe, my family's favorite. The stuffed eggplant is excellent.  My dad's favorite is the turnip (daikon) cake. Our kids love the egg custard and the sweet pineapple buns for dessert."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum on weekend in Phoenix east valley.  Expect long wait for a table and not so friendly service but their food quality is excellent."}

Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Cleanliness: 3/5
Price: 4/5

I have been to Phoenix Palace at least 10 times, and I have a pretty consistent experience each time. This is one of the only options for dim sum in Phoenix, so I would recommend this place for dim sum in Phoenix.

Food:
This place is like a traditional dim sum restaurant with carts being pushed and you order off of the items that are on the cart.
I usually order in Mandarin, and this works for me, but I know they can also speak English, but this might be a bit more difficult.
Some of my favorites are the shao mai, the dou hua, and chicken feet.
They have a huge selection of food that you can get, so I suggest you go with more people, so you can try out more food.

Service:
Especially during the weekend, the service can be patchy.
Usually, carts show up as you are trying to sit down, even if I'm still waiting for people to show up. So I do feel al little rushed at times.
Also, the restaurant is a bit crowded, so when there are carts being pushed around all the time, it does get a bit claustrophobic.
And I have had issues where the carts didn't have what I wanted, so sometimes you have to ask someone who isn't pushing a cart to get an item for you. Dim sum is about immediately available food, this kind of ruins the flow of the meal.

Cleanliness:
Not the cleanest, on par with most Chinese restaurants.

Price:
Usually a great price! Get enough to be full, and price comes out to about $10 per person in my experience. Different items/carts are worth different prices, so if you're concerned, just ask."}
{"text":"First off, I hate it when people aren't sitting yet or have our drinks and all the dim sum ladies come attack you with their carts! One person tells the ladies no we don't want anything yet and then they go ask someone else at the table and they stand there for the longest minute! 

The food is pretty decent. There were some choices here that are not offered here in Sacramento.  I like how everyone understands English.  Employees are nice."}
{"text":"I went looking for the typical \"not real Chinese\" buffet on a Sunday and found this place.  Never had Dim Sum before so thought this would be different. From the moment we sat down, the carts were on us putting stuff on the table and having us choose from a selection that I honestly cannot tell you what I ate.  I just said yes to what looked good.  I wasn't disappointed, but I can't tell you what I ate! :)  I do know that I accidentally said yes to the chicken feet thinking is was just fried chicken.  I'm adventurous, but that was too much so I left it.  Without even asking, they were cool enough to take it off of the bill.  We all laughed about how the server's children loved it, and they were really great.  The cart ladies struggle with English a lot, but that's OK as again, I just said yes to what looked good.  Overall the price was pretty reasonable and I tried a lot of food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat! They are not very busy Sunday nights.  We have been here a few times and have always enjoyed ourselves. Don't let them rush you."}
{"text":"The lady who works on Monday and Tuesday Nights is AWESOME. she is the reason why I wanted to write this review. She was friendly, helpful, and just an overall very positive person and I really enjoyed having her as our waitress. This is pretty rare in a Chinese restaurant. Food was good. Prices are fairly reasonable but dang snow pea leaves cost $16.95 that's pretty darn expensive. 

I returned for dimsum the next day (with a batch of other waitresses), and the service was, as expected, nonexistent to borderline rude. And since when is ha gao and a variety of other items considered \"large\". The only small items were chicken feet and all the other dishes were large and I've had dimsum for the last 20 years and I know which dishes are in what category. It's not a big deal since the price difference is very small so it acutally doesn't make a difference but I'm not sure why they think it's a good idea to mark everything large while it's probably smarter to make most items mediums and make a larger price gap (opps!)"}
{"text":"This place is really good for dim sum. I've been eating at C-Fu this whole time and I think I might find a new spot for dim sum. We went on a weekday afternoon, so there wasn't a whole bunch of people. Servers were really polite and sweet. Food came out steaming hot and delicious. Their plates are very large compared to C-Fu as well. Price wise wasn't bad, I believe we got about 8 plates for 2 people and it ended up being 30 dollars. Not bad. The environment is nice too. Might be our new spot for dim sum!"}
{"text":"Best place in Arizona for dim sum hands down. Even on weekends when it's super busy the servers have full carts being pushed around and so much variety. I never have trouble waiting for carts. Super fast and the quality of the dim sum is amazing. The shrimp rolls are the best. If they don't have a certain dish in the cart, you can order it and they will bring it to you, that's what I love about Phoenix palace. If you want the best dim sum in Arizona, come here!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my very first visit on Friday after Thanksgiving at 11:40am. The place was full like a weekend. I thought the hagow and shrimp and scallop dumplings had very thick skins, so I discarded them and just ate the fillings. There were no sui mai for an hour and just the same 2 carts going around and around. The sui mai were okay, but lacked shrimp and tasted a bit bland. Finally, some ham shui gok's (fried footballs stuffed with meat) came along with some sesame balls. We ordered the fried footballs and they were stone cold! I told the cart lady and she just shrugged her shoulders, like saying what could she do? Finally some panfried turnip cake came around and it was also cold. The trays of baked goodies came around often and they all looked very good, but we are more fans of the savory, rather than sweet so we felt that the variety was lacking in that department. We never saw any bean curd meat rolls, or stuffed peppers in black bean sauce either?I would give this place another try, but right now I feel The China King had better tasting dim sum plus you can order the fried footballs and turnip cake off the menu and know it will be hot upon arrival. The service staff were also rushing around past our table and that was a bit distracting. Maybe they were not expecting such a large crowd for a Friday?"}
{"text":"We were at Lee Lee market,  looking for things to eat, saw this one, it's said best dim sim in Az, so we went in. My husband likes shao Mai, so we had two tray. And shrimp dumplings, tou fu veggies, spring rolls, sticky rice chicken. Pretty good! Just the shrimp dumplings are too sticky, all stick to the pan."}
{"text":"Good dim sum joint! Place is clean. Service is fast. Wide selection of food. I like the noodles in the Mekong dim sum location better though... This place has good egg tarts and red bean sesame balls."}
{"text":"Great dim sum place in the valley.  The food tastes much better here than some of the other restaurants I've been too.  They have some very unique selections outside of the generic Har Gows and Shao Mai, however, the place is a bit expensive, and the Egg Tarts I ate were cold.  What's great is there's a BBQ shop inside the restaurant as well so you can take home a roast if you wanted.  

I also have no idea what the waitresses are saying in English."}
{"text":"This is the second time we visited here. We heard about this place as great dimsum place from our friends. Dimsum is served during lunch only. I am not a big fan of dimsum so I am giving this review based on my wife's opinion. It was not the best dimsum that we ever had. But considering this is non metro area, it was good enough that we would go back. Their egg tart were really good. Make sure you try these."}
{"text":"Yippee!! I finally found a nice dim sum place near where I live. I am impress at the way their service is managed. The staffs are always on the look out to clear your empty dishes or any service that they can provide. The carts moves around the restaurant continuously and you definitely don't see their staffs standing around and talking. We were presented with our choices of dim sum almost as soon as we sat down on our booth. Their tables were arranged in a very spacious manner, unlike most dim sum restaurants where you always have to move your chair when the cart comes around. 

All the dishes we tried were excellent - har kaw, siu mai, Shanghai dumpling, chao mi fen. They are definitely generous with their filling because every piece is very juicy and delicious rather than flour-like. The cook will occasionally comes around with a dish or two that was freshly prepared. Their yam cake is served straight from their portable grill on a cart. My favorite dish that morning is their egg tart. It is THE BEST egg tart I have ever had. The crust is crispy and flaky and the egg custard has a smooth consistency and just the right amount of sweetness.

Their pricing is also very reasonable at $2-$3 per dish. I wish there were more of us so that I could try more things. I will definitely visit again to try different things."}
{"text":"Ok, not good or recommended if you are a vegetarian, but if you are not and like to share food...this is a nice place to come with friends and try different options from their dim sum!!! I don't remember even one name of the things I've tried, so yes...it was really useful to have a Chinese friend with us."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I came here for to go.  I generally order to go from Dim Sum houses, since I don't like to wait for a table during the weekend.  However, I must say that I was surprised when I arrived at 10:30 AM that there was not a crowd/line.  Granted they had only opened at 10:00 AM.  So perhaps the next time I find myself out and about early and can get here at this timeframe, I may try to dine in for Dim Sum.  Now, I order several dishes that I had been craving:  Shanghai Dumpling, Hom Sui Gok, Har Gow, Shui Mai, Scallop Dumpling, Green Leak Gow (Pan fried), Spicy Salt Squid, Sticky Rice Wrap and Fried Shrimp Ball.  Since I ordered to go, I won't comment on the temperature of the food; however, it was still warm when I got it home, so that is a good thing.  All the steamed dumplings were good, well seasoned and had a good flavor.  The spicy Salt squid was ok, the batter was a bit heavier than I had expected, but the flavor was good.  I thought the Sticky Rice Wraps were a bit smaller than other places in the valley and the Hom Sui Gok was not the best.  I know they took it from the case that was probably sitting there when they first opened, so it was not hot to begin with nor crispy anymore.  That would be my only complaint, is to keep it under a heat lamp for a minimal amount of time so that it does not get overly cold and will not lose it's crispy texture that it would have if recently cooked and sitting.  The girl who assisted me was good, courteous and quick to fill my order.  Again, it's not something I go to all the time or eat, but I would definitely order from here again and will try dining in as well, if the timing is right."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place for my dim sum fix. Having moved from Washington DC I had dim sum whenever I desired it. Now that I am in Phoenix, AZ, it's harder to come by dim sum. I am so thankful I found this restaurant to satisfy my Sunday dim sum needs. The dim sum is very fresh. It's pushed around on a cart and made fresh. My favorite dish here is their tofu fan. Tofu fan is  sweet soft tofu dessert. I highly recommend it from here. Their tofu fan syrup has a subtle yet shockingly fresh ginger taste. 

Please take a look at my photos to see their presentation. In addition, please ask me any questions, that is, if you have any!"}
{"text":"1/25/2009 -- Wrong, wrong, wrong! I have eaten here four or five times since then. Helen Y. says Phoenix Palace acquired a master dim sum chef -- who now brings a relentless attack of treats every weekend.

Love the pan-fry cart with chive dumplings and rice noodles. Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but the snow mountain buns are fantastic, custard-filled delights.  I think they might not be good for you. 

If you have a few hours to kill late on a Sunday morning, I can't imagine anything better than eating dim sum at PHX Palace with friends and family."}
{"text":"I have been here when it was still a buffet when they first opened. I wasn't too thrilled as it was like any other buffet. The only cool thing I thought was the ice cream selection. 

Well that was then this is now...

On a very hungry late evening a fellow yelper Clifford and I were gonna meet up for some Chinese food. We were headed to our favorite spot on the east side. When I got there it was 5 min from closing and Clifford was still 15 min away. After discussing some options I made it down to Dobson and Warner to find Phoenix Palace open till 10. After giving Clifford a ring we met up there and gave it a shot. 

Upon entering I noticed that the place was empty, but not common on a monday night and with all the other places in the area closing early the complex is usually dead by 9. The place no longer having any buffet tables and many of the awful decor gone it could be promising. 

Seeing that their menu had some of my favorite dishes I thought I give it a shot. So some Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, Salted Fish Fried Rice and Beef Stew Hotpot. 

Wow! Were we surprised with the food, especially this late at night. The pork chops were well seasoned to how they should be and very crispy on outside and juicy on the inside. The beef stew was wonderful, the meat was well cooked and the large pieces of the green onion was a great touch of flavor. The salted fish fried rice was not so great, it was very under seasoned and the portions for the fish and chicken were not a large as some places are with this dish. 

On my second visit I tried a different fried rice dish and same thing very under seasoned. It seems like that the chef has very strong dishes and some other dishes are not so strong. I have yet to try the dim sum but i'm sure this is going to be very good as well."}
{"text":"We went with a party of 12 to eat for Easter. The service was bad, the food was stale and at the end of our bill we made sure to tip for gratuity, but one of the workers with a blue shirt accused us for not leaving any tip when clearly it was on the table. He chased us and made a scene which was extremely embarrassing, we made sure other customers knew of the situation. Very disappointed, have never been in a disrespectful establishment in my life."}
{"text":"Dim sum madness with all my Asian homeys! Not everything is great but really, every dim sum I've ever been to in any state is about the same..."}
{"text":"I personally love the dimsum here! They have all the basic dishes and some interesting ones of their own. I like that the wait isn't always atrociously long like at great wall in phx. The location seems cleaner and area is nicer. They automatically charge everyone a beverage fee (either tea or fountain drink but unlimited refill)."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Dim Sum in the valley.  We have dim sum at least once a month and have tried Great Wall, Golden Buddha, China King and C-Fu gourmet.  I believe that Phoenix Palace is the best of the bunch.

Here is why:
1.  Food quality:  Every dish was prepared perfectly.  Most were slightly above the other restaurants in term of taste.  There were exceptions (we like the shrimp stuffed eggplant best at C-Fu, and the chow mein better at Golden Buddha), but in general, this place was better.
2.  Cleanliness:  Not that other places are not clean, but this place was spotless
3.  Price:  We order almost the same thing at most dim sum restaurants as we have our favorite dishes.  We ordered more than usual here this morning to try some things (10 dishes total) and our bill was $25.78.  We usually average $33-$35 at the other places, and we brought quite a bit home
4.  Selection:  I have seen that the selection has decreased at the other places as their clientele diminishes.  For instance at Golden Buddha, one of the original dim sum places in the valley, you would wait at least 30 minutes if you did not get there before 11am.  Now it seems that the place is barely full, regardless of when you arrive.  As a result, the selection seems to have gone down.  At Phoenix Palace, we simply could not order everything.  When we left, there were still many things that we had still not tried.  We also had a few things that we had never had before (very surprising since we have dim sum so often)
5.  Location:  I live in the Ahwatukee area, so this is slightly closer than Golden Buddha, and far closer than Great Wall."}
{"text":"The place has the basics for dim sum, there are steamed pork buns, ribs, stripes, chicken feet, shumai, shrimp dumplings etc. They are all quite flavorful and standard on their tastes. The pork buns don't use a traditional bread but the bun they use taste quite sweet. The tripe is good and their other beef intestine dish is a bit salty for my taste but still acceptable. The food is average for dim sum, but it is pretty decent for dim sum in Arizona.
The service is not great I had to ask 3 or 4 times for shrimp rolls and the tea refill took a while to arrive. It was pretty slow on business too so there seemed to just be a lack of workers at the time even though we went at around lunch time. I would say Sunday would probably have better service but you would have to wait for a while. I have also had dinner here and they have better quality food as well as service then."}
{"text":"Personally, not fond of dim sum. However, I've been to a few and this one is pretty good. My boyfriend is HUGE on dim sum and this is his and his friends' favorite dim sum place. The workers are super friendly and is a chill atmosphere. My only complaint was the small waiting area in the front and sort of tight all-around. But it didn't really effect our experience.

Food was pretty good - again, not fond of dim sum. Great variety of food and selections. Didn't pay so I can't comment on the price."}
{"text":"THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE but the food selection is great! I only go here when I am really craving dim sum because I hate, I repeat, I hate, the customer service here.   I've dealt with many horrible customer service restaurants from the Asian community but this place has got to be the worst. The hostess does not care that you have to wait and only want to know if want the number or not. Servers who aren't your server do not care about you since you're not tipping them and will walk in front of you or push you out of the way to get what they need. The ladies who push the carts just want to give you food(it's not a bad thing) but they will get a little pissed off when you say no to everything on their cart, they will make sure you know they're giving you looks. However, the food is great and this place has an amazing selection of different dishes. Truly great for dim sum. I do hope they get the soup dumplings soon though because that's the only thing they are missing from their menu."}
{"text":"Awesome Dim Sum! Huge selection! We have been searching for somewhere as good as The Golden Buddha since they closed... we found somewhere so much better! 

The BBQ pork noodles are divine, the kids love the chicken feet! Have not had one bad item here. 

Can't wait to go back to try more as there are so many kinds of Dim Sum, there is no way to eat them all on the same visit. 

Well worth the drive to Chandler from North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Prologue:
I've dined at this restaurant for dim sum a few times in the past, however my fiancée had not and so we decided to give it a try together.

The Plot:
We ordered several of our usual favorite dim sum, including Pai Gwut (steamed pork ribs), Fong Djau (steamed chicken feet), Nor Mai Gai (sticky rice in lotus leaf), and Ngau Paak Yip (steamed beef tripe).
We also tried a couple of items that were new for us, including Baked Pineapple Roll with Egg Custard Filling and Cake Roll with Shredded Pork Filling.

The Scene:
My impression after this visit on the weekend is that their Dim Sum dining is now noticeably better, and consequently busier, than on my previous visits.
In particular was a greater variety of deserts, including the Baked Pineapple Roll mentioned above. Anyone who is a fan of Daan Taat (Egg Tarts) should enjoy the Pineapple Roll as much as we did. My fiancée, who is a native of mainland China, and I have never before had a dim sum item like the Cake Roll with Shredded Pork. The opportunity to try either one of these items would make a visit to this restaurant worthwhile.

The Rest of the Story:
The restaurant was very busy on a weekend afternoon; however we were seated within reasonable amount of time.
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices are standard for this level of dim sum.

Epilogue:
As good as this place is now while also being so close to home, this is now our go to place for weekend dim sum.

{"text":"I've been here once for dim sum w/a party of two, once with a large group and once for a large dinner party and each time the consensus has been that the food was just okay. Mind you this feedback has come primarily from Asians that have had their fair share of authentic dining all over the world, so they're quite seasoned. But coming from a white girl that is new to the world of dim sum, I'd have to agree.

I'm pretty sure that by now I've had a taste of most everything on the menu, and while nothing stands out as being outrageously delicious, nothing is particularly bad either. Some of the dishes I tend to prefer over others includes chinese broccoli, bao (pork rolls) and pineapple fried rice. Everything else is just so-so.

I do like the prices (around $2-3 a dish) and it makes for an enjoyable out-of the-ordinary-brunch outing for larger groups, but it does seem as though you get easily overlooked by the dim sum cart when you're at a small table, so I would seek alternative dining options if that's the case."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday at 12:30ish and it was super packed. They do a good job of getting people seated as quickly as possible. The options are your run of the mill dim sum options, nothing special. I would definitely come back, but it's not as good as Seattle :("}
{"text":"First off, this place was PACKED...but rightfully so. I could not tell what the system was but I decided to just buy to go. Well the to go people weren't much friendlier. So I had a bit of difficulty ordering or knowing where I was \"in line\". That's why I minus one star. 

However, service was what I expected and still way better than Mekong. The food was HOT and delicious!!! So many options! Really made me miss home in Orange County, CA. We will definitely revisit this place!"}
{"text":"07/20/11

2.75 stars.

Was shopping for tamarind candy and pan de sal at Lee Lee's, whiling away time before I was to meet an aunt at Mekong Plaza to dine at one (or two) of the food kiosks there, when I received a text from her saying she'd been in an accident.  Dropping everything, I met her at the scene.  An hour and a half later (she's not hurt, and the other driver was ticketed), I was starving for nourishment and aunt was not, so we headed back to the Lee Lee plaza to wait for her ride.  I was craving for noodles and was heading to Pho Van, when we walked by Phoenix Palace and decided I'd give it another try, as aunt gave it a green light, and I remembered from reading \"recent\" reviews that it was under \"new\"  management.  (Last time I visited was two years ago.)

A child host greeted and sat us at a booth.  (OK, she's Asian, so she probably was 13 years old... I know how it is... when I was 18, people thought I was 12, and now I'm... well, let's just get back to the review, shall we?)  We both ordered water, and I studied the menu.  After about ten minutes, the server that kept walking by our table finally approached to ask if I we were ready to order.  I asked if the BBQ pork lo mein came w/ vegetables.  He said that the chow mein had mushrooms, but the lo mein would not have any veggies.  \"No veggies?,\" I asked.  Can you add some?  He said, after some thought, \"bok choy,\" and I said yes.  I also asked if broccoli and snow peas can be added.  He said OK.  \"No celery, or carrots, OK?\"  He nodded yes.  I also ordered a batch of crab puffs.

The crab puffs arrived 15 minutes later, all golden-brown and smelled wonderful.  I liked the crunch of the fresh-from-the-fryer wonton wraps, but found that the sweetened cream cheese and crab filling too sweet.  I decided to eat a couple before the entree and save the rest for dessert.  (I found that I enjoyed the crab puffs more when I thought of it as a dessert, and not as an appetizer.)  The lo mein arrived four minutes after (19 minutes after time of order), looking delicious, but definitely cooked w/ carrots.  I didn't complain and let the matter drop.  I'd only expected bok choy, broccoli, and snow peas; Instead, I saw bok choy, carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, spring onions, and garlic!  The exclusion of broccoli was A-OK- I hadn't really wanted it in there; I just didn't want \"just bok choy.\"  The dish was very good!  Loved the sauce that it was sauteed in, though the BBQ pork was a little too fatty for my taste- I worked around it.  What I really didn't enjoy were the pieces of bitter bok choy.  Some were sweet, and after finding two bitter chunks, I thought I'd see if there was a reason why they were bitter.  A-ha!  Those that were bitter were bites close to bases of the stalks, which had particles that looked like dirt, while those that tasted sweet were cubed pieces, or stalks that didn't contain those dirt-like particles (see photos).  Needless to say, I felt less-enthused about the noodles after that.  Back to those crab puffs!

Server was unobtrusive, but could be found, if I needed him.  The woman who gave me the ticket and my fortune cookie was very sweet...  OK, Phoenix Palace.  One more strike in a few months, or maybe two years, and you're out!

{"text":"Great, every time. INCREDIBLY CHEAP!!!!

I always get the chicken feet, bao, and some steamed yellow pork thing.  ( I never remember the name).

Always the same quality, always sweet people that work there. I love it...

Actually... Now I want to eat there... Damn."}
{"text":"This is my parent's go to spot for dimsum in Phoenix, but we decided to try out the dinner here one day when I was home for the holidays. 

We arrived around 6 pm on New Years Day expecting a short wait, but the restaurant was almost completely empty. It doesn't seem like dinner service here is that popular, even though there's always a wait for dimsum around lunch time.

We ordered 3 dishes to share family style:

Beef chow fun ($10.75) - always such a classic dish, and they do it well here. The beef was very tender and flavored just right.

Hot braised sliced fish ($12.25) - I was disappointed by this dish. We asked our server about this dish before ordering, and she said nothing about it being braised in a sweet and sour sauce (and neither did the description on the menu). I don't like sweet and sour dishes and definitely would not have ordered it had I known. Though I do highly recommend for people who like this type of flavor as the fish itself was fresh and comes coated generously with sauce.

Black bean sauce spare ribs ($10.50) - enjoyed this dish as well. The ribs were tender and came with plenty of bell peppers and onions.

There was a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal of sweet taro soup, which is one of my favorite Chinese dessert soups.

Overall, my parents and I liked Phoenix Palace for dinner and would come back again. Prices for cheap for the portions that we got; the restaurant definitely didn't skimp on the meat."}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sum, but some minor quality improvements would easily put it into a best of Phoenix category. For example, BBQ pork buns were over baked. Same for the sesame balls.  Shrimp balls need to improve on texture. Additional condiments would be appreciated - how does one get spicy mustard here?"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried so far was amazing. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I've always eaten here for dim sum, but this was the first time I'd eaten here for dinner. It was pretty dead when we got here around 5 on Saturday, but more people came in as we finished up our meal.

There are 2 menus. The fancy looking gold menu seems to have strictly traditional style Chinese dishes, while the regular looking menu has a mix of traditional and Americanized dishes. We ordered from both menus and decided on the sizzling rice soup, lotus root with baby bamboo, fresh steamed fish, and walnut shrimp. All were delicious and well presented. Flavors were well balanced, and very beautiful looking. Some minor issues were that some of the bamboo was tough tasting, so it wasn't really baby bamboo, and the walnut shrimp had slightly too much mayo/creamy sauce on it. The star of our meal was the fresh steamed fish. Our waiter informed us it was very fresh (Probably brought in very recently), probably one of the largest tilapia I've seen! The meat was very flavorful and tender and the soy sauce based sauce went with it perfectly.

Service was decent and the young gentleman server was very friendly and spoke fluent English and Cantonese. 

Prices are a little higher than your usual sit down traditional Chinese restaurant but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese place I have been to, by far. Ordered the Vegetable Chow Mein and requested they also add tofu. Tofu was plain, drenched in water, and sticky. No flavor whatsoever, Broccoli was half cooked- if that. Would never come back here again. Service staff was also rude and inattentive. DO NOT eat here. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Probably the best dim sum served in AZ! I go here every weekend and get take out with the hubby. It's great! They never get the order wrong or forget anything. Service is a bit slower when it's busy and customer service isn't really top priority. But, the food keeps me coming back for more ALWAYS."}
{"text":"I've had plenty of Chinese food in my time, but nothing is better than this! The flavor is amazing and the staff is legit! I'm so spoiled now after ordering from them that I cannot order from any other. Phoenix Palace gives you plentiful portions so be sure you are hungry! 

My in-laws were in town not too long ago and they always NEED chinese food. We introduced them to Phoenix Palace and they were sold on the first bite! They made three meals out of one order because there was that much food!!!

In all honesty, we've only ordered out so we are not sure about the dine in experience. Over the phone and in person they are very friendly so I don't see dine in being a problem. 

Seriously, you gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"This is really traditional Chinese Dim Sum. As a picky eater, this is our newest favorite Dim Sum place in the East Valley. 

This is also our official meetup place for people to learn Chinese table manners and learning Chinese Language. We meet every few weeks on Sunday. You can also take out the Dim Sum, which we usually do when there is crowd. This place used to be empty when they started few years ago. Now the word of mouth brought them so many customers. You will have to wait in you come after 11:30AM. A friend of mine come down there every week from fountain hills to meet with us. 

The staff is very nice and friendly. They also have a quiet room for reservation if you have party of 10 more. If you are shopping at Lee Lee supermarket, you don't want to miss this Dim Sum place."}
{"text":"Very good dim sum. Not truly exemplary but it was flavorful and filling without being overly salty or anything. The price was good but the selection was kinda so so (I have been told its better on weekends, we went around noon on a Monday) and the service was alright. There were only two carts going so it was pretty slow. One of the ladies was also pretty mean.

Decent dim sum though!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We came here for dim sum and sat down, awkwardly looking around at other peoples' plates and trying to figure out how (and what) to order, but within no time a few nice people came around with some carts and started showing us all sorts of good things. We accepted damned near everything that they offered us, and everything was really, *REALLY* good. Gotta say, I'm not a fan of chicken's feet (they're just sorta cartilagenous), but this is definitely a good place to come and figure out whether or not that's your particular jam. Everything else was quickly devoured, and at some point we'll be back. My only gripe is that there could have been a bit more variety and a few more options- other dim sum places that I've been to seemed to have a larger selection, but I don't feel that it would be fair to knock too many points for that since what they had was so good."}
{"text":"Was really really really busy on sunday for dim sum but still everything was sooooo good, expect the duck. If it wasn't for the duck I would have given the place 5 stars. I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings, noodles, and pork & corn dumplings. Great staff, friendly and reasonable price."}
{"text":"It has too many reviews about the Dim Sum already. So I bet everyone would love to hear about the dinner menu in Phoenix Palace. It is delicious and full of varities from fisj, chicken to pork. I tried the steam talipia fish and vegies soup with half of the ducks. They are super delicous and fresh. I am really enjoying to eat here. They also have great customer service and really care for what the customer want."}
{"text":"I've noted in previous reviews about how I am not a fan of Chinese food in Arizona. Chinese in Hawaii just taste so much better to me. And maybe it's because I enjoy the bastardized Hawaiian version more, but I lament the lack of options in Arizona for Chinese that I find tasty.  

Fortunately, this place has great dim sum that is as good as most places I've been to in Hawaii. I'm sure \"real\" Chinese people (I'm Chinese but people have accused me of not being a real Chinese person) will say this isn't actual Chinese food or dim sum, and doesn't hold a candle to SF. I'm sure that's true but this place is good in my book.

My favorite items here are the XLB, chow mein, spareribs, bean curd roll.  They are delicious.  I personally don't like their potstickers because they have a strange fishy taste to me, which I'm not accustom to in potstickers (however, I don't like seafood so take my advice with a grain of salt on this front)."}
{"text":"What's not to love about dim sum? You can pick and choose any dish and they're small portions so you're able to try a variety of items for a reasonable price. Its kind of like tapas style, except dim sum comes ready-made and ready-to-eat to you in carts pushed by people. This place is busy on the weekends, but proves to be an excellent place to enjoy this style of dining. Check out the photo to see some of the things I ate (BBQ pork buns, egg tart custard, Chinese broccoli, shu Mai, soup dumpling, etc)....I passed on the chicken feet."}
{"text":"The food is good and it's pretty cheap. I'd come back (actually, I've been here many times before I made the yelp account haha)

Anyways, it's what I expect from a dim sum restaurant. Old Asian ladies walking around asking us to buy their food in their Asian accented English. Also young People walking around and cleaning or giving drinks. This place is good, but nothing special. It's a good experience to eat with many people. 

One thing is that sometimes the food cart ladies miss you. But other than that, the service here is as expected: good. 

Overall, good food, good price, nice environment and good service."}
{"text":"Good choice for dim sum. Prompt efficient service, good food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is great, it's a pretty big dim sum restaurant! They service here is friendly and funny. They will crack jokes with you and make sure you get what you want. The varieties of choices for dim sum is always amazing and they all always hot and fresh for you, unless other places where you'll eat a cold bun! YUCK! I came here after a new years night out and loved it! I would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and our Dim Sum fix for the weekend with my boyfriend. Came around 12pm and the wait was about 5 minutes - not too bad especially on a holiday. The food wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worse I've had - pretty decent for Arizona. Pricing wasn't bad either; it was a total of $37 including tips and tax for two people. We had the marinated chicken feet (tasty and steamed well), Siu mai, ha gao, steamed pork ribs, and a few other dishes. We had around a total of 11 dishes, which isn't bad for the price. They also have a to-go area for you to order and pick-up. Lots of parking in the plaza as well. Service was friendly to me, but I spoke mostly in Chinese when ordering so it helped. Will return for our dim sum fixes :)"}
{"text":"First time trying Phoenix Palace and the food was very good!! Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has taken over as the best Dim Sum place in the East Valley, and possibly all of Arizona if Great Wall doesn't step their game up.  One dish that you need to order here is the Xiao Long Bao, it is no Din Tai Fung but it makes me happy with every soup exploding bite."}
{"text":"The best chinese food in the valley. Im used to good Chinese food. Born and raised in a chinese family in new york city, there was never a shortage of good authentic chinese food. I was quickly disappointed when i moved into the valley, until i found phoenix palace. My go to chinese restaurant. 

Dim sum is also the best in the valley. All the baking is done in house and can compete with the best."}
{"text":"Phoenix Palace is such an amazing place for dim sum. The food is always wonderful, the service is friendly, the prices are fair and the food carts come around often and the food is fresh! We love the shrimp and leek dumplings, shumai, calamari, shark fin dumplings, rice steamed in banana leaf with mushroom and pork sausage inside, roasted duck, and much more. There are so many good things to choose from. Those are just a few of our favorites! We even took some to go!"}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum spot, except you can rack up a pretty hefty bill! 

So there's mostly only a couple of spots to get dim sum in Phoenix that I consider note-worthy: Great Wall (too far for me), Mekong, and Phoenix Palace. 

I usually go to Mekong but I decided a change of scenery was good because my parents usually like going to Phoenix palace! 

First things first, the service is way better here than at Mekong. Mostly because the square footage that the cart pushers have to cover is a lot less! I also enjoyed the difference menu options that I'm usually not used to seeing at Mekong!

Everything was hot, and most of the food was good, some of it was hit or miss though. Like for instance the har gao (shrimp rice ball) was super tiny, compared to other places that have it. However the shu mai (pork meat dumpling) was huge compared to the other places!  To lo mai kai (sticky rice) was actually kinda dry, which was odd! 

However the service definitely makes up for just some of the foods that didn't taste as good as I get from other places! I will say though that the prices of some dishes are a lot more pricey than it's competitors like Mekong, which I believe is a flat rate for most of the normal dishes. 

All in all, I'm kinda torn between whether I'd come here or not. Overall it was a great experience, but I also spent $116 treating out my family, which usually id end up with a $80 at Mekong. Try both, and see which one you like!"}
{"text":"Our go to dim sum place! Lots of great selections, one of the best in the valley! The shu mai is a family fave! And the service is also good. Might be a 20-30 mins wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Due to the lack of good dim sum places in phx, i've had to get my fixes here. this place is SOOO hit or miss. I've had good to terrible food depending on the day. however, id have to say the shu mai is always a hit-- plump and juicy! the rest of the selection is rested on pure luck. 

The service is pretty good. Theres a younger guy that is oh so nice and genuinely happy. Its always so nice to see him."}
{"text":"We eat here at least twice a month.

There are two things that set this place apart from most other dim sum restaurants in America, never mind just in Phoenix.

1. A chef who loves to bake.  The head chef, Sam, is constantly baking up really delicious specials.  These are typically sweets/desserts and they are awesome.  He will come out to the tables on a busy weekend with a hot baking sheet full of pastries.  If he offers, by all means, take some!

2. Extremely accommodating service.  We take all of of friends there and that includes some very picky eaters, as well as kids.  I've never seen any restaurant go to such lengths to make sure everybody is happy, including making all kinds of off-menu items to satisfy the pickiest eaters.

Bottom line, it rocks!"}
{"text":"Dimsum! Weekends are so busy, these people are legit cantonese/chinese which if you do not know is as authentic as you can get.  Dim Sum is a Hong Kong brunch (cantonese people).  I am a big fan of this place because all of your yummy dim sum items come out piping hot! I have gone to places where they are just warm.  We are really looking forward to trying dinner here one day.  Will become a regular here for dimsum :)"}
{"text":"I generally eat dim sum at Phoenix Palace as I have found the regular menu items to be better in other Chandler restaurants. Love the online ordering option though, very convenient.

I grew up in SoCal near Monterey Park and Hacienda Heights and I definitely need a dim sum fix a few times a year. The offerings are at Phoenix Palace are surprisingly similar to those of CA dim sum restaurants. Chicken feet, porridge, crispy taro puffs, egg tarts, spare ribs, steamed stuffed rice noodles, bbq pork buns, etc are all offered via push carts. The quality is pretty decent, the wait staff speak cantonese and its generally an authentic experience.

I prefer Phoenix Palace as opposed to the other large restaurant across the street also offering dim sum. The food is fresher (perhaps due to larger turnover). It certainly gets busy on the weekends and the general rule of dim sum dining is to arrive before noon."}
{"text":"This is the first dim sum place I've found in this area, so I'm not sure how they compare to others here.  I have a pretty high bar for dim sum, but I have to say this place is great for dim sum!  I've lived in a lot of places around the country and have tried many dim sum restaurants, but this is one of the best ones.  Wide selection, tasty food, and not as crowded as many dim sum restaurants.  We loved every food item we ordered!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about dim sum here in the Valley, but I just haven't found one that is even close to half-way decent.  The pork rice wrapped in leaves was pretty good, as were the shrimp dumplings, but the pork dumplings, the egg custard, and the taro root, which is usually my favorite, were pretty bland.  The fried rice and noodle dishes that we had for the table were also very bland. 

I wish that my first choice, Pho Van, had been open.  The things you do when you're hungry and don't want to get back in the car."}
{"text":"No buffet here. 

Dim Sum or sit down & order off the menu. Why not try Dim Sum?

If you are new to eating Dim Sum or are wondering what is it? It's basically various carts being pushed around with a variety of Asian appetizers...mostly steamed dumplings with meats, shrimp, and/or veggies. Most plates are about $2.05 with 3-4 pieces per plate.

OK, if you are searching for Gringo stir-fry dishes...keep looking, perhaps there is Panda Express around the corner to meet your needs. When you step into a Chinese restaurant and you see mostly Asians, well then get a clue that it's NOT going to be Chen & Wok quality....this is the real stuff! Don't be scared to try some of these dishes, you'll be hooked!

We ate there around 11:30am on a Friday, there were about 7 other patrons in the place and the SAME steam cart being pushed around for about 45 minutes, before the fried items/dessert/sticky buns cart made an appearance....followed by the Congee (thick, sticky rice porridge) cart....before both disappeared again. 

We had to order Turnip cakes from the Food Server, or we probably would had been waiting all afternoon. 

We had plenty of Har Gow (shrimp dumplings),  siu mai (steamed dumplings), páigwat (pork spare ribs with black bean sauce), and beef tripe....don't let the steamed chicken feet frighten you.

Egg Custard is delicious for dessert.

The Dim Sum selection was pretty slim for a Friday afternoon. 

Restrooms were SUPER CLEAN. The restaurant was VERY CLEAN too (compared to the Great Wall), and the service was friendly.

**There is also an area near the front to the right for take-out or BBQ meats or Roast Duck. I get pretty leery about how long cooked meats have been sitting out (HOPEFULLY) at the proper temperature under the heat lamps in Chinese restaurants (this place has been in repeat violation for NOT keeping these meats \"within food safety limits\"...per County inspections).

I would try the Dim Sum again if I was in the area, because the place was clean and the service was friendly and the Dim Sum was good. 

Hopefully, there will be more carts next time, or we'll just order add'l Dim Sum from the Food Server to supplement the cart selections."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum isn't very good here. The chicken feet had no flavor at all. Everything just under-seasoned. Service wasn't all that great either."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. I was surprised that the carts came around so frequently and our tea pot would be filled the moment it became empty. There was this guy coming out with special dishes, he's a good marketer btw. Lol. 

As far as food goes, it was good, not great but it was more than just okay. The salt and pepper squid was too breaded in my opinion, but the congee was surprisingly pretty awesome! The eggplant was also a favorite of mine. The Chinese broccoli was overcooked and shriveled to me so it was a bit rubbery and difficult to eat."}
{"text":"I don't have have dim sum often.. And I have tried a couple of places but I do like the food here better.. They do get busy here fast so I suggest you come right when they open.. When it does get busy, the main thing that sucks is just waiting for the carts around and of course when the cart with the dim sums u want comes I feel like we have to stock up on the ones we like bc we don't know when they are going to come again.. And I feel like the ladies that pushes the cart gets a lil aggressive and tries to force food you don't want at you and when you don't choose they get mad at you and leave.. But other than that we do like the food.. We love getting the pork buns and shu-Mai here.. Those are our top 2.. And every once in awhile I like getting the chow main , Chinese broccoli and their porridge.."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their food (there way better then china kings dim sum). Way bigger selection of dumplings and everything looks cleaner. The place is super busy but the fungi area is big so there is not a long wait. The price is very responsible and 2 ppl can eat for under 30 at least during lunch time."}
{"text":"I prefer Phoenix Palace to C-Fu Gourmet for dim sum. Judging by the wait on Sunday mornings, I'm not the only one! I love their bbq pork buns, dumplings, stir fry noodles, sticky rice with pork, and desserts. They have this one dessert that is like a sweet almond milk soup with a pastry crust - really yummy and unique. The servers don't speak great English, but that's ok as long as the food is good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dim sum after waking up late today (since Hunter slept in til 10 am) so by the time we arrived was 2 pm. Worried there may not be a lot of choices but there was plenty! Started with haw gow and sui mai which were both excellent!! Got 2 beef churn after the first was so smooth. The tofu shrimp was very good as well. The chow mein was freshly made. Ribs were not bad, the only Negative was the sweet breads which was simply not very good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for dim sum with a good selection. On weekends, they have a much more extensive selection and many more carts running around. The servers are fast and ready to get you selections not on the carts (we always order some type of veg to go with our usual spread of gluttony). My only tiny gripe is that they don't have dou-miao (pea shoots), but we did like their stir fried green beans. We've only lived here for not quite a month and have been here 3 times plus it's a 25 min drive..."}
{"text":"I was a dim sum virgin until yesterday!  My wonderful wife Audrey W was there to share my experience with me as were Dottsy Z, Donald S, Marian and Kevin H.  And Dottsy has pictures too!  And wow did I get off cheap!  

The best dim sum I have ever had!  Honestly, the only dim sum I have ever had!  I'm so glad I had other yelpers that were experienced to share it with and help me enjoy the first time!

Seriously, Phoenix Palace has really good dim sum.  I enjoyed nearly everything I tried, there was tremendous variety and high quality through and through.  I was not quite as adventurous as some of the more experienced folks at the table.  I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasn't ready to go all the way.

The review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.  I don't know but it was good.

For 6 people and loads of food the total was just under $70.  Unreal.

Great lunch spot for dim sumderful variety and a total bargain.  Phoenix Palace is in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so you can fill up on dim sum before you do your shopping.  Then you'll spend less when you go shopping.  Never go shopping hungry."}
{"text":"First off don't come here alone. Portions are for 2 or more and the menu doesn't offer more than one item and rice so it would be too much for one person to order 2 items. I ordered the Orange chicken because its a dish that is hard to screw up. Well despite the place being fairly empty and several staff on hand it seemed an eternity before any one took my order. Once my food arrived I dug in only to find the chicken flavorless with barely a hint of orange. It tasted more like sweet and sour sauce of the grocery store variety. I ate 1/5 the plate a decided I could do better at home with a packet of spicy seafood ramen. In the time it has taken for the wait staff to notice that I had given up on their tasteless dish to the time I received the cheque has been an eternity. I will never eat here again and I recommend that you don't waste you time or money. There is a plaque at the front door that claims best of Phoenix... I doubt they would win that award today."}
{"text":"Busy, tasty, and courteous staff for Dim Sum!

Dim sum is hard to come by in Phoenix.  Even more so good dim sum.  That's odd given the size of the Phoenix-Metro area and the asian/pacific islander population.  Phoenix Palace helps fill that hole in a shopping area that seems to be our version of Asian Town.

Food and experience are what you know if you've lived in China, only minus the grand hall.  Pastries, seaweed salad, duck, sui mai, noodle and rice dished, bok choi, and other servings were all yummers, cooked well, and with fast-paced fun.  Clean restaurant and it was fun watching the nine year-old hostess manage the surges of customers.

Staff was quick and accommodating.  As usual with dim sum, it can add up and become expensive if you get careless with taking too much.  Affordable if you don't go crazy.

We'll be back..."}
{"text":"We shop at Lee Lees all the time (in the same shopping center), and we had eaten at Phoenix Palace back when it was a buffet, but it was only recently that we realized that they now serve dim sum everyday. 

So today we rushed over there to check it out. The wife, while born and raised in the Philippines, is of Chinese descent and grew up around this stuff. When you consider that, along with the fact that our first date was ten days together in Hong Kong (dim sum heaven), you can see that the bar is pretty high for us when it comes to dim sum. Now, we know we cannot expect Hong Kong or even San Francisco quality in Phoenix necessarily. Still, the food at Phoenix Palace was quite good overall. We were not disappointed. 

We had two types of shu mai, along with har gow, jellyfish, barbecue pork buns, sesame balls, pot stickers, and spring rolls. We missed the chicken feet, which is one of Carol's favorites, but we'll get to that next time. All was great, but the har gow especially stood out. It was a quite different flavor than what we have had at Golden Buddha, C-Fu or any of the other local places. Everything was yummy though. 

The service, on the other hand, was mixed. It started out nice, with a friendly greeting by the guy that seated us. But it went downhill from there. Its not that they were rude or unfriendly. It was more like benign neglect. The carts came around quickly enough, but once we had the food we did not see anyone again until it was time to settle the bill. No refills, in other words. That said, at least the glasses were large and we had a pot of hot tea, so it was not the end of the world. Another gripe--no chile oil. I  think I'll bring my own next time. Or maybe we just caught them on a bad day.

The food was a four or a five by local standards, while the service was a two or a three. Since I can't give 3.5 stars I'll go with four. It's really nice to see a growing number of decent dim sum restaurants in town. Hopefully this is a trend that will continue. 

By the way, they have a take out counter also, as well as a regular menu. We'll check that out sometime in the future and report back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! - Not bad for dim sum in Arizona! I went with a group of six people on a Saturday and the bill was only $11 for each person including tip! ($2.95/set)

Favorites:
Shaomai
Shrimp dumplings
Chiu-chao style dumplings

They also served tea with real flowers in them. The place was packed and had so many people from young adults, to families, to old grandparents eating. 

Tip: Bring cash, it'll make paying much easier."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible and rude service. Would rather take out than eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok so I have never tried Dim Sum before and I will never eat it again. I tried a pork dish and it was like chewing wood. I could not get my teeth through the gritty wooden texture of this dish. I tried the sticky rice, it was ok, but there was a mushy center and it wasn't particularly tasty. There was two other dishes I tried. I don't remember the names of them but one of them has a clear coating around it, made me think of squid, which I actually like squid but this was mushy and tasteless. I ate three bites of my meal and left. $19.00 later I am so dissatisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"Of course you cannot compare to dim sum places in the west or east coast but for AZ it's pretty decent. Best to go on weekends. More customer means more variety and fresh dim sum. Weekday choices were pretty weak..."}
{"text":"I don't believe this restaurant has a buffet for dinner any longer. Tucked into the most Asian intersection in Phoenix, Phoenix Palace is a gigantic open space of a dining room and looks like a very authentic place. There are always tables of Chinese men drinking coffee and catching up on weekend nights. On Friday and Saturday nights, you'll be able to catch Chinese karaoke night from about 10PM on. 

They serve fantastic food. Nothing here (at least on the menu they give us whiteys) is really out of the norm from your normal Chinese place. They have a couple of dishes I'm not accustom to, but mostly is the familiar Kung Pao, Beef & Broccoli, Hot and Sour Soup, etc.

The food here was delicious, service was perfect, and the atmosphere was truly one of a kind for Phoenix. If you'd have asked me a month ago where you could go for Chinese karaoke, I'd have said San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City. Well, now I know, and my life is complete. 

I wouldn't hesitate to go back here for more meals. The food is incredbly tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Not many choices in Phoenix for Dim Sum. They have a good selection and carts are always around. Food is not as hot as I like it on Saturdays, but always is good on Sunday's. This is our only place we now visit for Dim Sum. That being said there really is no other places than Great Wall to get a full Dim Sum menu in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My lovely Japanese friend is always inviting me to the latest and greatest of finds and this one is great. I have no idea what anything was called and I have never had dim sum but this was great! the best was this custard cookie thing, my good it was amazing.... So I recommend it. I just pointed to stuff on the carts and it seamed to work."}
{"text":"The rating is more for the food than the service.  This is your typical Chinese style serving where some of the servers have limited English, 3 servers asking for orders at once; random staff pulling empty places or checking for empty place off your table.  We didn't have a tea refill so can't say if its the usual lift up the teapot lid and they'll swing by to pick it up and return with a full pot.

Because of the limited English, it may take a little longer to understand what they have on the carts, some of them do rattle off the dishes pretty quick.  Pointing at a dish is acceptable or just say the dish name and they'll tell you if its on their cart or not.

I and the family went there recently as a change from our usual dim sum place, our usual haunt has become boring because the kitchen isn't introducing new dishes and I'm greatly pleased that they have expanded their menu!

They had the usual turnip cake, sui mai, har gow, egg tart, sweet beef/shrimp rice noodles, lotus wrapped sticky rice, spicy shrimp, fried pot stickers, etc.  What set this place apart was that they had shrimp stuffed tofu, garlic chive and shrimp dumplings, soy milk, shanghai dumplings (3 orders!), a cream based bun, little mini fruit tarts .  We left with lots of leftovers."}
{"text":"Came here one night with the fam and we got two different kinds of whole chicken from their ready to serve hot food area.  It smells good enough.  We took it home, chopped it up, and started to eat it.  

About 20 minutes later I started to heat up like a teapot, the world started to spin, the trees were talking about equal rights, my stomach was turning, the roaches were painting with the colours of the wind, sparks were flying, and for a moment I thought I was dying.  

I suddenly had the urge to run to the restroom and so I did, and there my body decided to flush itself out!  I was sweating all over, my noise was running, my eyes were watering, I was throwing up all while doing a one and a two all at the same time.  It was a horrible case of food poisoning.  I was out of commission for three days, 4 hours, 27 minutes, and 11 seconds.  

Never again did I went back to this place, took a long while before I started to eat chicken again.  What an experience!  I heard the restaurant side was good, I'm not risking it though!"}
{"text":"Went on the weekend for dim sum and was not disappointed. They have a wide variety of traditional dim sum items. Although they seem to specialize more in the pasties and buns. They will also prepare traditional Chinese dishes during dim sum. Our favorite that we order as a side dish is Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce. If you have never had dim sum then try it. It is a n experience you won't forget."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed myself today with a group of friends including fellow #YelpElite Suhas, most of us had never eaten Dim Sum before. I was one of them, so I had no expectations going in, except seeing carts on carts of food around. This is definitely what we got at Phoenix Palace!

One of our friends set up a reservation so our group  wouldn't have to wait, most recommended since it gets busy super early. We had the perfect table that fit everyone comfortably, right smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. The cart ladies are a-plenty! 

Literally the cart ladies started surrounding our table once a majority arrived. Kind of overwhelming to have all of them descend on us like that and none of us know what to order except for our main organizer who made all of the ordering decisions. Whatever he picked for us though was amazing! Dumplings, rolls, noodles, meats, EVERYTHING was delicious. I wouldn't be able to tell you what I ate, but it was crazy good. And then someone thought up the idea to get a plate of chicken feet for anyone to try. Dont think I will eat that again, ever. 

The cart ladies were most excellent at going around the restaurant and asking if we wanted more. The desserts are generally sweet rolls and I forced myself to only eat one (curse you carbolicious bread!). 

In total we ate for $14/person with tip and it was worth every penny. We all brought cash so the check could be split evenly. Cannot wait to come back and experience dim sum again!"}
{"text":"I've been doing monthly Dim Sum events with a group of people and I am a loyal fan of this institution. 

Since I've only had Dim Sum, I will only mention the Dim Sum service. The carts speed by you very quickly but slowly die off in frequency at the end of your meal.

The only reason I feel that this is the best Dim Sum in the Valley is that they take reservations unlike their competitors. I can have a group of 20 people and they will reserve no problem, well, at least when I schedule at 10:30am.

The golden gem in the Dim Sum selection is the curry tendon, melt-in-your mouth tendon that has a great curry flavor. No other Dim Sum place in Phoenix has it."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum place in the Valley. They always have a wide selection and the food is great.  My favorites are the turnip cakes, the shao mai, and the pork buns.  Expect a little wait on the weekends, since this place seems to be quite popular. Enjoy checking out the dollar store next door while you wait, they have lots of little goodies for the kids. 

Their dinner selection is actually quite good, too.  Some great dishes, so I took a colleague from Guangzhou. He was skeptical, since he doesn't usually like American Chinese restaurants, but he actually quite liked this place."}
{"text":"Food is great here. Staff friendly. I've only done take out. Someday will dine in. If you like Dim Sum this place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"This place has super lighting quick service.  When my husband I took a seat we were almost overwhelmed with all 4 carts already pushed towards us an yelling the menu options.  It was nice because sometimes dim sum places can be slow and you have to wait for your favorite dim sum. 
We tried the ha gao (shrimp dumpling) & they had diff types of cheung fun (rice noodle sheet) they were soft and chewy.  I liked the dou Jiang or soymilk which comes in a large cup was only $2.  We ordered the fried pork dumpling and sticky rice which Were nice and piping hot.  
The only let down was the turnip cake that fell apart when you eat it and some parts were too dry. Definitely come with a group they have large round tables that could easily fit 10 & you can try lots of variety of dishes. They also have a to-go deli where you can order BBQ pork,  their dim sum, and roast duck at affordable prices.  Next time we're near Lee Lee's plaza we will have to check them out again!"}
{"text":"Does anybody know how to eat chicken feet?  This is my second time going to Phoenix Palace and everytime they offer me the chicken feet, I always decline. Not because of way they might taste, but i don't know what part of the foot to eat!  We'll i ask some of my coworkers who have tried it and filled me in on how to eat those suckers!
I love this place because they have a good amount of dim sum dishes you can try.  I usually go for the gai lan (chinese broccoli w/ oyster sauce) and the chow mein, which they give a very small portion.  But all things i have tried are great.  Other dim sum places are great but i tend to order alot of things that it's kinda pricey after picking too much stuff.  The reason i like this place is it's a little cheaper then the others places nearby.  And the staff a very friendly on letting you know what the dim sum varieties are.  Great Place!"}
{"text":"There aren't many dim sum places in the Valley but if I go I go here. It's very large, service is meh and typical of most Chinese restaurants. We laughed once cause we noticed they sneak a charge of water, hot tea (which is free at Chinese places), and table cloths in your tab. It's not a lot but it's just like really dude?

Food is decent if I gave a craving for it. I mainly come here to catch up with friends and eat."}
{"text":"Just between us, I thought the entry way smelled a tad like sewage.  Not a lot, just a little.  But I'm no expert.  Could have just been the hostess having a heavy day.

But hey, where else are you going to get an 8-course meal for $6.97?

(1) Hot Tea
(2) Ice Water with lemon
(3) Egg Drop Soup (with those chicken noodle soup noodles in it)
(4) Egg Roll
(5) A Lunch Special Entree (Mine was the Sweet & Pungent Chicken)
(6) Steamed white sticky rice
(7) Fortune Cookie (which was really more of a quote, than a fortune)
(8) Sliced Oranges

OK, so I'm getting pretty liberal with my usage of the term 'course', but that's a whole lot of pabulum for what was charged!  (go ahead, look the word up.  I used it correctly)

And for extra ambiance, there were a gaggle of ducks lounging outside of our picture window.  Wonder exactly how 'fresh' their Peking Duck is?"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving dim sum, this is my goto spot! 

You can go wrong any of the dishes. The clams, seasoned asparagus, ha gao or shumai, fried chicken, chicken feet are all items that I order.

My favorite is the ha gao, I can eat about two orders of it. For those who don't know it's a pork dumpling and shumai is a shrimp dumpling. Both are my top two choices! 

Hot tea always goes well with the meal, as well. It can get busy here on the weekends so plan to come early, if you have a bigger party then most likely if you have to wait. If it's just 2 people you'll get seated faster."}
{"text":"This is a decent dim sum for the moment. The siu mai is my favorite, hot and fresh! Char Siu Bao is good too. Not dry and over steamed.

The hargow was a little funky. The wrapper was a bit too thick and chewy, giant chunks of shrimp, but not too much flavor.  Same with the sticky rice, it had a funny aftertaste....too much lap cheong (chinese sausage) 

This place is not a buffet.  It used to be one before and I think they just kept the name.  Get there early, (before noon) if you want to have more selection and fresher dim sum!"}
{"text":"Our go to place when we're craving for dimsum. This time around was not so pleasing. We knew it will be a wait but if the food is good and service is okay we will wait. Finally got seated and very efficiently all these carts started coming towards us so we started picking out over 6 different items and ordered half of roast duck. After all the food arrived we started to dig in. Right away we flagged down a server to have several items heated. Duck and stuff eggplant was very cold also the noodles. After waiting so long to be seated we waited longer for service and the food was not good at all! I am very disappointed with the lack of quality of the food and the service. our bill was over 80.00 which is normal for for us and we will try this place again!"}
{"text":"The food was great and tasty. We ordered a glass of house wine, when time came up for payment, we were charged $8.25 per glass (It is way to pricy for this type of restaurant). Just drink the Tea...good luck.."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese restaurant.  This place is the only other place my wife and I would eat Chinese food from the other is Tao Garden which is one block over.  Clean place, fast service, large seating areas, and dim sum in the early afternoon.  I only come here late night to grab some dinner when we don't cook."}
{"text":"This was my first real dim sum experience. The food all looked so good! I was worried I would have no options that didn't have pork, however, there was a lot of seafood and duck as well 

My favorite was the gelatin rice with chives and shrimp and the sesame balls with red bean paste. There was so much I cannot remember all the names, but I enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"I would say the dim sum is pretty good during weekend but not the weekdays. 

Food: The crepes of the rice rolls (??) were too thick.."}
{"text":"Best Dim-Sum in town.
By far the Phoenix Palace has one of the best Dim-sum and menu.
The service is always nice and friendly.
The restaurant itself is nice and clean.
Highly recommend the Singapore Noodles, I can't enough of it.
Do yourself a favor and visit this place any day of the week for lunch starting at 10:00 AM.
Afterwards take some time to visit some of the other restaurants within the shopping strip and make sure you check out Lei-Lei Supermarket with their great products from all over the world.
This is the Walmart of the east.

{"text":"Jim W had an interesting thread the other day \"what do you miss?\"
I don't miss many things about living in the bay, but getting my dim sum fix once a month or so is one of them.
I had my office on Market St. and I had a Yank Sing in the alley right behind my building...I could go for dim sum at lunch, let the dishes pile up and waddle back to my office for nice long afternoon nap:)
If I felt more ambitious, I could walk up to Chinatown to Delicious, New Fortune and Yong Kee for some of the most remarkable food this side of Hong Kong!
It was especially pleasant when we got 4-5 of us to go, and just sit and talk and eat for couple of hours...the art of dim sum:)
With that in mind, I headed out for the near reaches of Chandler this past Saturday.
Jim and Audrey W. organized a dim sum outing at the Phoenix Palace Buffet (I frankly didn't notice the buffet...I'm sure it was there and very good...I was just too busy pointing at bamboo steamers and bowls and plates and saying \"give me that one please\":)
Jim organized the outing after fellow Yelper Helen Y had noted that this place had changed ownership, chefs, etc., and is now quite good! (I now have 2 things to be grateful to Helen Y. for...helping us find good dim sum in greater Phoenix and allowing me to become a citizen of the Republic of Sweet:)
We were joined on our outing by Kevin H (in an interesting side note, Kevin got ROTD for...Phoenix Palace Buffet on the exact same day that we went for dim sum!!! What are the odds!?:), Marian H. and Dottsy Z. 
The Beautiful Carin wasn't able to make it...she had a little stomach bug and stayed in bed:( 
I was going to stay home and take care of her, but the lure of potentially good dim sum was too great!:)
Off I went with cheery wave and a lilting \"feel better\" hanging in the air as the door slammed before she changed her mind and asked me to stay around and nurse her back to health:) She's a strong girl...I knew she would pull through:)
Boy, am I glad I went!
The company and conversation were wonderful...everyone cheered me up about having to leave my better half at home (and as anyone who knows us will attest, Carin really is the better half...maybe the better 75%:)
It was a perfect dim sum afternoon! 
We talked, pointed at the carts, ate, talked and ate, talked and ate:) 
I think dim sum is as much about conversation and relaxation as about the food...but having said that, having great food really adds to both the conversation and relaxation factor of a great dim sum lunch...and the food was remarkable!
It was so good! 
There might be a couple of shops that top this place in SFO, but not by much...it's that good!
We had all the standards, shrimp rolls, pork buns, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice (outstanding sticky rice, BTW).
We had some of the non-standards, tripe, chive dumplings...all delicious and served up with smile!
The service was very good...there were always carts in close proximity, and if you saw something a few tables away and flagged a server down, they always made their way over to help you out:) drinks were refilled promptly, and the empty dishes were moved out to make room for new arrivals.
The biggest surprise came at the end of our lunch...the total for 6 of us was less than $70!!!
I used to spend more than that for dim sum lunch for 2 in SFO (and twice that much in HK)! Amazing!
Jim, thanks for organizing! It was a great lunch with a fun group!
It's great to know where to get my dim sum fix!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! Really authentic Chinese Food! Every one is giving bad reviews to this place because of the delivery service but no one is giving a fair review of this place's food!! 

It's hard to find good Chinese food in Arizona where Asians are 1% of the population. It takes me an hour to drive here, but I am SOO coming back for the food! 

If you are a fan of good Chinese food, you should try this place too and NOT judge this place based on bad delivery reviews."}
{"text":"still the best in AZ!  Tried an old spot that used to be good last week, definitely made me love this place even more..  Phoenix Palace, you are the KING!"}
{"text":"Why did they not have chili oil? Not too bad for a dim sum place. Try their dumplings...those are the only thing that is very good. Tgen again...I am pucky with taste......"}
{"text":"I'm not going to talk about the food because 1. There are other more egregious errors at play here and 2. It's a dimsum place in Arizona; the food is gonna be like any other dimsum place that's not in CA/NY, with the same preprepared frozen dimsum items that every other dimsum place carries.. It's as decent but it's what you'd expect. 

Halfway through our meal, my dad sees a friend of his (another Chinese man) arguing with the man at the podium taking numbers for customers just arriving, as dimsum here is always extremely packed since they are one of the only places left in Tempe/Phoenix. The friend comes over to explain that he had just eaten there, and as he was leaving he saw the manager/podium guy turn away a black family. Not only did he refuse to serve them initially, when they asked why the podium guy just started physically pushing them out! When this friend asked why, the man blew it off and just said he \"did not want to serve them.\" My dad, and the rest of our family, was outraged just as this family friend was, and so the friend went back to the podium guy to complain, saying \"you can't just not serve that family for no reason!\" Upon hearing that the podium guy turns to our family friend and curtly states \"you can leave too\" and begins to push him out of the restaurant too. The friend starts yelling \"I just ate here!\" Such unbelievably atrocious service and racism at what I used to think of as a half decent dimsum place in Tempe.

We quickly wrapped up our meal after witnessing this all go down, and the podium man comes over to quickly start taking our empty plates/dishes away. As he tries to stack too many plates he can handle in an attempt to clear the whole table, he ends up spilling my moms tea, nearly all over her. Then he just up and left without apologizing.

I have attached a photo of this man to my review. His face is slightly blurry but you'll know him if you see him. He is a racist, with no decency for treating his customers with any respect. I strongly suggest Phoenix Palace fire this idiot before they risk this bad press getting out and losing customers. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre ( at best) but service is pretty bad! The employees seem angry and like they don't want to work - and when I paid with my card the employee asked me where was the tip ?! It's on the table I replied....... Very BAD thing to ask and do! I've never been to a place where they hunt you for tips ( before even looking at the table) it just seem so unprofessional and impolite. 
Better off at Mekong"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different at another dim sum.place we Yelp had 4 stars  , I don't agree with it, the duck was not roasted duck it taste very weird like grainy and nasty , shumai was just alrite and they chicken feet was the best out of all the food we order. The pastires they had a huge selection but the inside custard was very hard inside. 

My sisters moved here from California and we just visited them and we wanted to see what dim sum was good in Arizona. I would not return here awful dim sum only chicken feet I would get again."}
{"text":"I would come back anytime I'm craving for greasy chinese food. The only thing I didn't like is the fried rice but the rest is good!"}
{"text":"Their dim sum is OK. I can think of many places that serve better dim sum. The baked goods are better than other dim sum dishes. Service is always meh.. the cart ladies can be a little more friendly. Overall.. food is not worth the weekend crowd here."}
{"text":"the food is as great as usual~ no wonder why it gets the voted best dim sum in Phoenix~
Love the sesame ball and shaomai~"}
{"text":"That's right I tried it again... I'm a sucker for torture. Reading all the reviews about the \"Yummy in my tummy\" Dim sums being served here I decided to be part of that action. It must have been a slow day (Thursday 12:30) but there weren't any fresh carts around and thus my First Round of traditional dump sum was a crashing failure (sticky skins with dimsums collapsing on touch)

The second round I decided to go with the non-skin offerings (bbq pork, chicken feet and beef tendon[with curry powder, blech!!]). Not very impressive, though the chicken feet was quite good, jalapeno in the marinating sauce !?. 

The redeeming dish was the desert tray which came out fresh and hot. The bean and pork buns were heavenly.

Will try this out with my Zong guo peng you tomorrow (3rd time better be the charm)
Third round"}
{"text":"Geographical proximity has always been a bane for my proclivity for good authentic exotic food. Needless to say that has never stopped me from trying all the close establishments. Chinese food being one of my favored cuisines led me to be easily convinced to accompany me colleagues to this joint. The first impression was quite decent. Also the fact that it was once a Vietnamese establishment that catered to wedding parties gave it a pseudo garish pomp. Ordered the egg[plant steamed fish, green beans... while friends ordered the kung pao, lemon chicken (oh lawrdy!! bleah...). Not bad not bad , I mused to my self and put it down as another place to revisit.

However every subsequent  revisits here has been a horrible experience in terms of food. At one point I managed to peek at \"non-chinese\" cooks making our dishes. Sigh! one of those precipitously  \"going bad\" joints, ratified by their 6 health code violations. Ah well on to Swadee..."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was a little pushy, but I guess that's all dim sum place. I really like the chicken feet and steamed shrimp dumplings!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, there were no host to greet us. Later a lady asked me to be seated. I have told her we are a party of two. She told me to wait and I have seen people running after the staffs to check out (Service Failure). They didn't have the supreme broth dumpling where a signature dim sum place would have in most exquisite places. Compare with those places in Hong Kong, California, and New York, this is a huge step down. The service is always a weak sector of a Asian restaurant and this is no exception because service people are treated like a slave (low people and their face and attitudes reflects that as well). When you have to ask for everything from water, tea refills, even the basic items of the dim sum, it has already lost two stars with me. The seaweed salad is filled with artificial food color which made me sick to my stomach (the dye spill over the sesame seeds). I have ordered duck tongue, crispy roast duck, and jelly fish which are just OK. This place will never survive in California, due to lack of real competition (China King, SIFU, and Golden Budda), it is a winner by default so I will hope to see other giants who will come over here. Even Albuquerque had better dim sum than this."}
{"text":"Went today with the girlfriend  tried dim sum and it was fantastic the dessert wasn't anything to die for if you want to try dim sum definitely make this a stop on your route :)"}
{"text":"The waiter and waitress are rude! The cups are dirty with spot. The plates got residue stains still stuck on it.... really dirty. Water taste bad worse than tap water on ice. The food taste alright....some food are a little salty. But for chinese traditional food, I give it 3 stars but for the service a -2 star. Need a lot of work on the service.  Need real training on how to clean plates, tea cups and especially wine glass cups."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I had dinner Christmas Day after confirming they would be open till 10pm.  Arrived at the restaurant 6:35pm.. some customers but not packed at all.  Had to wait about 4 mins to be acknowledged and seated.  Another 5-7 mins before someone takes the order for Hot Tea.... Then the order was taken, 3 entrees and 1 Assorted Won Ton Soup aka Wor Won Ton Tong.  When the soup was delivered, almost 20 mins later... excuse from Server was, \"the kitchen lost the ticket\".  Ok... soup looks good but 5 mins later... the 3 entrees were delivered.  Now that is not good since I was still on my 1st bowl of soup.  That's not good because by the time I am finished with the soup, the other food was getting cold... no longer hot out of the kitchen.  Had 2 ask twice in a 20 min time frame for plain old water for my friend.  And this time was requested in English.  The server was very distracted...Chinese woman obviously was not \"with the program\".  She was quick to deliver the check and asked to pack the leftovers while we were still eating.  I speak fluent Cantonese being HK born so language was not a barrier.  I tipped only 10% for this poor service.  I was invited back for Dim Sum... Not sure I will be in a hurry for that.  Dim Sum is no fun room temperature."}
{"text":"came here for dim sum this past weekend and I was impressed. they have all the usual dim sum favorites and some that I've never seen at dim sum before (e.g. soup dumplings). came with a group of 12 people and our bill came out to $86 without tip. we each paid only $10 and we were all full. I am definitely coming back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"We finally had time to try dim sum here. We came in around 2 pm on Saturday and were seated right away. As soon as we sat down we had 3 push carts by our table (all at once) offering dishes to us. I wanted to get my hot tea first but that came later. We ordered few dishes and kindly told them that was enough for now. Not 5 minutes later, we had 2 more carts pointing things out to us. Not to mention one lady placing dishes we didn't order on our table. We had to tell her 'No' firmly. Another time, we had to say 'no' like 4 times before we can get her to leave us alone to enjoy what was already table full of food. I have never experienced such pushy dim sum ladies in my life.

Food wise, few dishes were lukewarm (expected given the time we arrived) but others were still steaming hot. We were also very hungry and we could've eaten anything at that point. My favorite was the egg noodles stir fried. Everything else was as expected. 

I would love to come back here but those ladies are a big turn off for me. Dim sum is meant to be enjoyed leisurely reading a newspaper. If I were to come back, I'd come during their peak time so that they'd be too busy to be harassing us."}
{"text":"If you ever want some cheap dim sum and good food, Phoenix Palace is always a good choice [but not the best!].  Service is always great and the food is always delicious.  There's this one guy who always walks around spouting flirty comments to all the girlies.  \"Hey, pretty girl.  Want to try...?\"  I swear it's less creepy than it sounds.

Anyways, the overall ambiance is pretty hideous but who cares?  Prices are reasonable, food is fresh and plentiful, and if you want some fresh BBQ, the little side-shop upfront is always a great option.  While not the best on the east side, Phoenix Palace is always a great option."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last weekend.  The food was good, plentiful and relatively cheap.  I really like their sticky rice and steamed ginger tripe.  The roast duck was also tasty."}
{"text":"First of all, to be clear, I have really high standard for dim sum. 

Spare ribs, Egg&pork congee and chicken feet are the must-have for me every time. So I first tried them. They were good but not best, a small step down from Great wall or China King. But the Egg tart and Pineapple buns really impressed me! If the Pineapple bun served right from oven, it must be heavenly good!!

The service was fine, but no one served water until we ordered chrysanthemum tea. But this place was not so crowed like Great Wall or China King. We didn't have to wait in lines even on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life here.  The server was incredibly rude and the hot pot was disgusting. Find another place!"}
{"text":"Dimsum here is great! Happy to find an Asian restaurant that serves good dimsum in Phoenix. Coming from LA I'm spoiled with amazing Chinese food so nothing here is comparable but Phoenix palace gives me what I want when I want and I can't complain."}
{"text":"Yesterday 07-09-11 I had my first dim sum. It was ok. Too many bread items. The girl with the fried chicken and egg rolls, etc walked so fast I couldn't get her attention. I left their without eating any meat. Not by choice. I would go back and eat off the regular menu. Plus, I was the only one out of 200 that wasn't Asian. That has to tell you something about the food."}
{"text":"Went in for dim sum with the kids. There was barely anyone in the restaurant. We ordered the usual- black bean spare ribs, shu mai, har gow, sticky rice, chicken feet and coconut buns. One lady came to our table in the beginning to offer steamed dishes and at the end I had to walk over to ask for the buns. I didn't get offered porridge or any soups... :( 

Food and service were ok- maybe they had an off day?"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I definitely love their shrimp noodles sauce since it's quite similar with the sauce that we have back in my hometown. Their dim sum is not as good as the other place such as C-Fu but since I am in love with their sauce so much, I came back every time for dim sum. However, their service is just horrible. The people delivering foods can hardly even speak any English. In addition, their attitude towards customer was unacceptable. I used to be a waitress so I know what should be a standard service. When I asked for some extra sauce, they clearly give me a disgusting look and roll the eyes over me like I'm not even their customer. They even speak in Chinese to the other employees and I can realize through their tune saying bad thing about me and my friend. What's wrong with you? I go to a restaurant and I certainly can pay for any extra cost for the sauce. If it's needed to be charged, I'll pay for it but just don't give me that dirty look especially when you work at a service industry. I'm your customer and I should get at least some respect. It's even horrible that they ask for tip when I don't think they deserve it. They try to make tip a mandatory thing when it's optional. And I strongly don't feel like they deserve it. It's horrible that they think they treat customer like that and still get paid for a good amount of tips. It's non-sense. I don't know how good your food is, but there are tons of restaurants out there that might have the same or even better food quality than you guys. So be cautious about how you treat your customers or else you guys might be out of business soon for such attitude."}
{"text":"I gave them one star because I couldn't give them zero. 2 hours for delivery and the person on the phone just kept saying they were my neighborhood. Finally called and told the, to cancel it but I half expect them to still charge me."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is incredible! The wait is out the door on weekends but worth it on so many levels. The carts are chock a block filled with scrumptious noodles, dumplings, buns, tarts, and more. The service is quick, so pay close attention. The prices are very reasonable, and the food is amazing. We absolutely love it and have been here over a dozen times. Yummmmmmm."}
{"text":"Great selection of items, good service, and everything tastes yummy. It can get busy during the weekends especially with many other dimsum places now closed but it's worth the wait. I love getting the soybean milk. So fresh and sweet! A tip, they have many varietal teas, specify or ask. My fav is the chrysanthemum tea."}
{"text":"This was our first time here after reading all the great reviews, I expected more. We must've come at the end of dim sum on a Saturday afternoon. We were promptly served but almost forcibly served certain dishes. 

We almost felt as if we had to take the dishes as rushed as we were being made to feel, yet the restaurant was pretty empty. We had Pork Belly (a chewy, gummy gelatinous mess stuck to the bone) that I took one bite of. The rest of our typical dim sum items were great. 

I give the restaurant 3 stars for cleanliness, promptness and service aside from the dim sum server. We will be back to give it a second go round- at a much earlier time."}
{"text":"Went in for Dim Sum

Food...meh.

Service...meh.

The real big issue is that I don't speak Chinese and the folks that work there don't speak a lot of English.  As such, figuring out what exactly you were getting, or not getting, was somewhere between hard and impossible to figure out."}
{"text":"Currently the best dim sum place in Phoenix and Chandler.

Quality Dim Sum and always busy.

They serve the typical Sui Mai, Har Gao, Sticky Rice, Short Ribs, Rolled Rice Noodle with Shrimp, Steam or Baked Cha Sui Bow, etc along with ordering from the menu.

I would recommend the roasted pork also and get there early on weekends to make sure you have premium selection.

Parking is plentiful and be quick on selecting the items because they go fast.

Good for large or small parties and you can generally sit 10 per table.

Keep in mind the portions are like tapas so you may tend to over order as it looks like you really didn't order much but it is very filling.

Will continue to come here for dim sum even though it is about a 25 mile drive one way."}
{"text":"I've been to many local restaurants for their dim sum. This is by far the best place to go. Their soy sauce noodle is the best but not always available. Many times they will only bring it over upon request only. Their BBQ is also very tasty. Love this place"}
{"text":"very typical dim sum. i don't know why it's still called a buffet though since they are no longer a buffet."}
