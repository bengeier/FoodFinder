{"text":"It is very cheap to eat there and the service is good, but the food is lacking. If you need a cheap place to go, this is the place. If you want quality Mexican food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came here after church looking a nice meal. The staff was very nice and accommodating to our food requests.  

The place was very nice and welcoming. With mexican music playing in the. Background. 

The was decent and well priced. Nothing to write home about. 

I would recommend going to Si Se√±or instead. I feel the food is better flavored there."}
{"text":"You've got to be f***ing kidding me. Despite only one other table being served in the dining area, the service was slow and ineffective. Flies flew about the bathroom while crumbled-up toilet paper stuck to my shoes. We ordered the queso fundido, which was liquid cheese dip covered in grease and some old chorizo scraped from the bottom of a pan.  The queso wasn't served with little plates, and the waitress acted like we were an annoyance to ask for them. We would have sent back the appetizer and ordered some entrees, but the waitress was too busy chatting up the other table. The margaritas were alright, but I ordered the pitcher on the rocks and they came blended. I would have sent them back, but it took 20 minutes to order and receive them."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food. 
Although, a fantastic margarita...?

Waitress asked if we were ready to order 2 times in 2 minutes. First time my coat wasn't even off, and the second time we had our menus open for like 20 seconds, no exaggeration! 
Ordered a chalupa and chiles rellanos and received a tostada and pile of ground beef with some velveeta on it which contained two slices of green pepper?
My partner ordered an enchilada and got a quesadilla. 
It tasted bland, and of poor quality.

The golden margarita was great, though- very confusing. 

Don't know if this was uncommon day for them, but I'm not coming back to find out.
Go to Villa y Zapata."}
{"text":"Is great during the week good hot fast food. Staff always nice.  But very bad saturday lunch. Cold food  nonchalant waiter. No chili in chili relenos  still really good mon to fri lunch. I have not been dinner hour but will stay away weekend lunch. When its good its very good. Good prices and nice to children."}
{"text":"So this place recently had an owner change... No more military discount. The food is still good though. The fajitas actually went down in price, but you no longer get rice with them. Over all still a solid Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Ehhh ok place not really impressed only saving grace is the cheap alcohol the poblano soup and the rootbeer... got the chef special steak had a huge chunk of gristle and fat and didnt taste like anything.  also got the spinach and mushroom quesadilla and I'm almost positive it had canned mushrooms they were super rubbery and nothing really had flavor. ..only gave it a 2 because the poblano soup was amazing."}
{"text":"We went for the first time on a Saturday afternoon for lunch/dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised by such a friendly greeting!  All the workers there were smiling and very welcoming....Good start!!
     The server Mariana was very friendly and attentive.  The food came out Fast and there was plenty of it!!  It was hot and tasty. 
     The only down side is their salsa...it tasted like it was made from canned tomato sauce instead of fresh tomatoes,  The workers there are from Mexico and we know how good true Mexican salsa is - so hopefully they will change what they are serving now.
      There is a lot of construction in front of their restaurant - but it is worth the trip and it is great for lunch since they serve you your food really quickly!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'd give it five but I don't want to jinx it. The food wasn't CRAZY good but the one thing I did love about the place was it was clean, well-lit, and the tables weren't on top of one another. The waitress seemed genuinely friendly and not like most places where I feel I'm being hated on for being a white American or something (no, I'm not paranoid)....I'm a very intuitive person. 

Anyhow, go here for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place really is a Mexican gem in Old Brooklyn, where I currently reside.  My wife and I really enjoy mexican cuisine and would probably eat it daily if we could.  This place really hits the spot, and does it in style.  

A few things set this place apart from restaurants like El Campasino and the like.  Firstly, it is very CLEAN. It doesn't have that grungy feel like some mexican restaurants exude.  Secondly, it has very fast SERVICE. From my experience, other places like this have average at best service speed and accuracy-wise.  This place also has a menu chock full of delicious burritos, tacos and the like, nothing monumental, but they do give extremely generous portions and it always tastes great!
Also, the prices are very fair (average price for a giant burrito with beans and rice is $8.50 or so).  

I've yet to have a bad experience here and would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I am rather upset about the downturn this restaurant seems to have taken. We have been there several times in the past and always had wonderful experiences, but this time was horrible. 
First of all, the waitress acted like we were a huge inconvenience to her. We didn't ask for anything over the top or special, just the normal soft drinks and food. 
The salsa was almost completely flavorless. It was basically pureed tomatoes, but that was only the beginning. 
My daughter's tacos reached the table stone cold and practically inedible. She didn't eat them. 
My husband's meal was made with the incorrect meat, but was ok. 
My meal was also cold and my tostada was one of the most unappetizing things I have seen in a while. Just a smear of beans and some cheese and beef crumples on a tortilla. No lettuce. No tomato. No sour cream. It was basically a flat disk of bland. 
My husband complained about the food and we met with an \"oh sorry\" and nothing more. Not even an offer to reheat. 
We will not be returning until some improvements are made."}
{"text":"The flavors and proportions are awesome here.  I especially love the guacamole and queso  blanco  dip."}
{"text":"Great food, decent portion sizes, good prices, awesome food choices. Nice layout and a lot of space. Drinks are average."}
{"text":"YAY!  I love El Tolteca.  This might be the best Mex place on the West Side.  Very reasonable food, large portions, good, fresh vegetables, and BIG yummy margs!!!

I've been here twice and both times I had a great experience.  They have a live mariachi band that is sometimes there etc.  

The Salsa is fresh and has a decent spice.  The veg. fajitas were a nice mix of fresh, seasonal veggies.  I've had good service both times I've been here too.  

Go here, you'll be full & happy!"}
{"text":"Ah, sweet El Tolteca. I have many fond memories of you, and it's your jumbo margaritas that are to blame. Yes, I know they come in a pitcher size...those are also fantastic...

The service is great, food is wonderful (I love the fish tacos and the chimichanga). Complimentary chips and fresh salsa with your dinner? Yes, please! Oh, and did I mention they've got killer margaritas?"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  Very impressed.  Fast friendly service.  Very nice feel to the place. Fell in love with the salsa they served with chips as soon as we arrived Had Pollo loco--quite tasty.  Grilled onions on top were extremely delicious!  Yum! Everything very fresh.  Healthy portions. Prices very reasonable. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"See \"Bob L\" review posted on 12/29/2012.  It's a spot-on review.

Tacos al pastor are the real, yummy deal.
Most freakin' fantastic refried beans EVER.

Odd colored 1800 margaritas....suprisingly good and the odd color must have been efforts to jazz-up a margarita mix.  VERY good BANG FOR the BUCK.

Owners/staff have pride -- the joint is clean, service is prompt and all the items ordered were fresh.

Will return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Parma. Huge portions, extremely fast service (every time we are shocked how fast), and very affordable. We usually split the fajitas and still have leftovers to take home! The plaza surrounding this place is a disaster, but El Tolteca is a gem! You wouldn't guess it from the outside, but the interior is really spacious and cute. They even have a huge bar area in the back. We just love this place!"}
{"text":"Typical gringo Mexican. Skip it. There are other authentic options out there.  Service is friendly. Chips and salsa average. Neon green artificial margaritas. The usual tex mex combo plates. Nothing interesting"}
{"text":"Most Mexican restaurants in Cleveland fall into two categories, places that are by Mexicans for Mexicans (sorta scary for us outsiders) and places that are by Mexicans for their gringo cousins. I've been two both types and they have their pluses and minuses. El Tolteca falls somewhere in between the two. It's tasty, it's cheap and it's Mexican. What more do you want?

El Tolteca, which in Spanish means the Tolteca, is located in a strip mall in the city of Brooklyn (it's basically Cleveland). You really can't miss it with its enormous corner location and colorful signage. I know you're hesitating, reluctant to give in to yet another Americanized Mexi-joint, but hold fast. Give it a chance. 

When you walk in through the double doors and through the vestibule the first thing that hits you is how big the place is. You could probably play team jai-alai in this place. If I had to guess I'd bet it seats about 100 people comfortably. We were greeted by a smiling host as soon as we entered and ushered to our booth to the right in the main dining room. Sombreros on the walls, flat screens playing silent football, Dos Equis banners strung from the ceiling, El Tolteca has it all. I think I even saw a sign for live mariachi music. We all know there's nothing better than strangers with really big guitars playing loud ethnic music at your table side while you're eating. Moving on...

We were there on a Friday night about 7pm and the crowd was fairly sparse. Once we'd gotten situated in our booth someone stopped by with a basket of warm, crispy tortilla chips and a bowl of salsa. What? Complementary chips and salsa? Unheard of. Once past the initial shock of free munchies we started to wander through the menu. The menu, actually a little booklet, is huge. Filled with every conceivable combination of meat, beans and rice imaginable if it's Mexican it's in here. Burritos, sopes, tamales, flautas, fajitas, chimichangas, carne asada, the list is mind boggling. The bottom line is, you will find something to eat.

I'm a craft beer geek so I rarely stray, but when doing Mexican I have to have a Mexican beer. $3.25 for a bottle of ice cold Negra Modelo. Nice. Here's how our meal went:

Cheese Dip - Oozy, gooey, cheese, melty goodness in a little bowl. This was way better than the usual orange processed stuff you normally get on nachos.

The No. 2 (go ahead, laugh) - Taco, enchilada and chalupa combo platter. My wife opted for the pollo variety and was quite pleased. The chalupa, a flat. crispy corn tortilla topped with refried beans (the real deal, no vegetarian beans here), juicy, well-seasoned shredded chicken, lettuce, guacamole, onion, and tomato. The taco, crispy variety, was traditional and tasty and the enchilada, a corn tortilla wrapped around chicken and covered in a red chile sauce, was delicious.

The No. 23 - Burrito, tamale and chalupa combo platter. The burrito was soft and the ground beef inside was seasoned well. The tamale, one of my favorites of the dish, was yummy. The steamed masa (cornmeal dough) was soft and flavorful and the red sauce added just the right amount of heat. See above for the chalupa.

Sure, it's in a shopping plaza next to a Salvation Army thrift store. Sure, it reeks of Mexi-kitsch and sure it has all the makings of a stereotype, but damn, it's good. The authentic service was very friendly and prompt. It actually seemed like our server was happy to serve us. Did I forget to mention that our total bill, including two beers, came to just under $24. There aren't too many places where you can get a meal for two and walk out the door for less than $40 anymore. We actually had leftovers so we got a lunch out of it, too. Go here now."}
{"text":"Not terrible but not the best.  There are plenty of mexican restaurants in C-Town to choose from."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean & decor isn't overdone. Our server was friendly & attentive. The salsa is yummy. Large portions @ reasonable price. Enchiladas & quesadilla were good. Will return!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it both times! Clean, big portions, reasonable prices. Service was exceptional both times too. Hot food in about 10 minutes. Can't wait to be in that area again."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Mexican restaurant for a long time.  But  they have different owners and the food has gone down hill. The hubby had a combo  plate with enchiladas topped with what looked like tomato soup. He said it was just okay.  I had Pollo Con Crema, chicken and peppers in cream sauce. Not as good as it used to be. There were red bell peppers in it and it gave it a sweet taste that I didn't care for. Usually it's made with various green peppers.  The rice & beans were good as always, and their guacamole is always great.  Still get lots of chips & salsa when you get seated.  Service was fine but we'll have to see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"What you expect is the same-old-same-old Americanized Mexican restaurant. You know, entrees covered in cheese, endless chips and salsa, margaritas made florescent green, etc.  

And yea, there is a little bit of that at El Tolteca, but there's a lot that's good too. 

For starters, the lunch portion of the chicken fajitas, extra spicy with added jalapenos--hell yes. First of all, it's fresh, hot, glorious and fast! I got this dish within mere minutes of ordering. Second of all, this is a lunch portion? For $6.99 I was expecting elf-size, to be honest. Then, this mound of delicious smelling fajita goodness was set in front of my face. Ummm, there's no way I could have finished all that food! It's a tremendous value. The chicken was tender, the veggies still had crunch and the spices were awesome. They serve it up to you with three flour tortillas, rice and beans. I will say the rice and beans were pretty average for this type of restaurant. 

The endless chips and salsa were good, but again, typical. The margaritas were just meh, but at least you could taste the tequila! 

I would totally come back here if I was in the area. The food is above average, the service is good and fast, the space is really nice and it's a lot of food for your buck."}
{"text":"Went back on Sunday. What a mistake. Chile Rellenos - cheese inside was burnt.  Too bad.  But they did improve the salsa and the chips were fresh this time."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, there has been a major menu change. Prices are slightly higher as well.

Service is still excellent and place always spotless.

The carne colorada actually is spicy. Such a rare thing to find in this area. Too bad the sauce had a burnt aftertaste. Refried beans are just meh now. Not really happy that the tortillas served with the meals are now flour ones, as corn would be more traditional. They still serve gigantic margaritas (60 oz)."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I like the place....I've been here more than 5-6 times for dinner and drinks and the place is good.  Service is fast and they have a great, inexpensive lunch menu that includes Saturdays.  A ton of options for under $6.00 and you get a lot of food.  The free chips are fresh.  As long as they are open...I'll go back.  I do miss Roosters though. :("}
{"text":"I love their steak salad. My husband and I sat out on the patio the service was fast and area very clean. Very friendly waiter. The food came out fast and big portion."}
{"text":"Well, this is kind of a mixed review for me.

 I did like the food. My son and i went there for dinner. The place is huge, and was mostly empty.   2 people saw us come in, and said nothing to us. Then a man took us to a table that is pretty much  shoved in to what really is a walkway against a post as soon as you are in the dining area. We felt like we were in the middle of the isle. With only 3 other tables seated, we didn't need to be at the awkward table. 

 We sat for a while. We saw 2 servers, NONE greeted us. Finally, a waitress that had walked past us probably 5 times, came over. She mumbled- \"what to drink?\", then walked away. She never smiled, or tried to be nice. She mumbled when she took our order, and never came to refill drinks. With the place being so slow, there was no reason service should have been bad. The food came out pretty fast, and what we ordered was correct, and actually very good. 

Since we got ---service with a frown---i would rather go to Don Ramon where they are always friendly, fast, and very nice to us. Their food is good too, and i would rather be where someone seems to want our business."}
{"text":"Just had lunch. I had the beef chimichanga. It hit the spot. The place isn't fancy, but cute inside. Food was out fast and hot. Totally hit the spot. Is it truly authentic?? I dunno, but its not taco bell, which is often the only Mexican option."}
{"text":"Food is good but they have yet to get our carry out order correct!! Why do we keep going there, because the next closest decent mexican food is 15 mins away. They  need to get their act together!!"}
{"text":"Had the seafood fajitas here! Was so delicious service was wonderful:) atmosphere was dim and the fajitas had crab, scallops, and shrimp! Came with a side of rice, beans, guacamole, and veggies."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner and had the whole place to ourselves (probably should've been my first clue that this place wasn't amazing).   The menu is huge so it is a good thing they bring free chips and salsa to munch on while you turn through the pages.

We got a pitcher of margaritas for $13.99 - and they brought the full pitcher and the two glasses were already full too :)  The margaritas weren't fantastic - too much sour mix and not enough tequila.

I ordered the carne asada burrito.  It was just \"warm\" and didn't really have much flavor.  I actually had to dump some of the salsa on it to spice it up a bit.  The portions were large but when the food isn't fantastic it really doesn't matter how much of it they give you.  Even the guac was bland.   

Our server was fantastic and attentive - she actually was sitting at a table near by us waiting for us to need something - kinda awkward but I drink a lot of water so I didn't mind the 100 refills.  

Might give them another try!"}
{"text":"Great service great food.  Great prices.  Our new family restaurant!! Just moved to Cleveland two weeks ago have eaten there three times already.  They never let us down.  Great job there guys"}
{"text":"Have heard good things from a few people, so I decided to stop in and give them a try.

Service was prompt and friendly, prices very affordable for the portion size, food however was lacking.

I ordered the beef fajitas. It comes with a plate of rice, beans, pico, sour cream, guac, and lettuce. Hope I didn't forget anything, because it was a huge portion for $10. 
The beef was from a cheap cut of meat, not seasoned well. The green peppers, tomato, and onion with the fajitas all seemed to lack any real substance.
Rice and beans were just filler with no positive flavor, just blah. Rice was also a bit dry and old.

The interior was pleasant and clean. The portion sizes and prices are great, but there is a definite sacrifice to be had. The food was not bad, but it wasn't good either. It was just \"food\" of the tex-mex variety. I would rather spend a few more bucks and have a better quality meal.

I may stop back in if I'm in the mood to eat a lot of food for little money. However, if you are looking for some quality Mexican food, you should probably keep searching."}
{"text":"Always fast, always friendly, inexpensive, and tasty.  5 stars for sure.  This is the best place in biddulph plaza, and by far the best restaurant that has ever occupied this space.  The salsa is so tasty that we even order a takeout order.  I love the fajitas and the Vallarta special.  The margaritas are always a great choice and are nice and strong.  Very worth it for the price."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for fish tacos while out and about in the Brooklyn area, so we stopped into this place located in the old Roosters spot in a strip plaza. 

Not much to report: the menu was pretty typical for a Mexican restaurant. Prices seemed to be pretty cheap, the fish tacos were pretty good but not great, our server was friendly and fast. 

Nothing too exciting or special here, but it definitely is a viable option next time I feel like getting tacos."}
{"text":"Okay...I am a California native that transplanted to Ohio a decade ago. I have had the worst time finding real, authentic, well-seasoned Mexican food. This is the only place that has come close except for Salsita's in Kent (which is way too far for me to drive on a regular basis.) Free, fresh chips and salsa, food arrives super fast and always the utmost of courtesy. Our favorites are the chimichangas, fajitas, and burrito verde. No, not all dishes are exactly like back home but everything is fresh, hot, and no one in my family has EVER gotten sick after dining here and we have been patronizing this place for years now. One more thing...DON'T forget the fried ice cream. Don't be afraid :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and don't have much to compliment or complain about.

However, I have learned that they've recently hired a dashing new table MAGICIAN to entertain me while I eat spicy food.

Hopefully this makes dinner at El Tolteca even better!  Did anyone catch the name of this handsome MAGICIAN and BALLOON TWISTER?"}
{"text":"I love this place and it's a tried and true standby for me. It's not overly impressive or anything, but it's consistent, good service, clean and the food is satisfying. I love their chips, salsa, and guac, and I would honestly go there just for these. The margaritas aren't anything to write home about, but the food is good and CHEAP. I always leave happy when I go here, and would defniitely recommend for a quick afternoon lunch."}
