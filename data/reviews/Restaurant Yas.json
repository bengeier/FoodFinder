{"text":"Great food! Friendly and warm welcome with fast service. The appetizer dishes were to die for!!! Tasty kebabs too! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"It was so bad. In comparison, by the other Iranian restaurant,the quantity was very low and the price was high(about 20%).I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Hello, I am writing this review because as a food admirer, I have to tell the truth. As an Iranian, I am ashamed that such a place exists.  I can definitively say this restaurant has a combination of poor service and food with no taste. I hate owners who think customers are stupid and we won't notice bad quality food.
We were a group, and I had the chance to taste all the meals and my conclusion is that the meat wasnt fresh, the chicken not well marinated and cooked and the fish, that one was for cats not for humans. 
Quartier perse or Tehran are way better.
You can definitively see they just want to sell to make money and not about good food.
Mes amis quebecois, ce restaurant ne reprensente pas la fine cuisine perse.
I am giving 2 stars, one because is the minimum and the 2nd one because we can bring our own wine."}
{"text":"As much as I like to have given this a better rating, every single experience was bad.
 first, the place was empty when we got there for lunch (not a deal breaker, but just saying). no matter.
 we were greeted by owner/hostess/waitress... a very nice woman. 
one of us ordered koobideh, and she said: Our koubideh has not arrived yet today. what???? So when I read another Yelp reviewer that they also were told this place did not have Koobideh, then a red flag went up. not serving Koobideh in a Persian restaurant is like not having steak in a steakhouse. why would they lie to us that it has not arrived yet, at 2 PM for lunchtime? 
the salad and mast-mussir was very good, especially the salad dressing. fantastic. and that's about it. 
we saw a guy coming, looking like a Pizza delivery boy, and brought some stuff. Now that I think about it, I could swear that it was our food. Maybe their kitchen equipment was not working and they ordered from another place, I don't know. it just seemed weird. One of us ordered chicken kabab and the rest barg kabob. she brought barg kabob for all of us. I didn't make a big deal. the barg kabob was terrible. seems like they had slow cooked the kabab over an electric oven, really bad. 
she brings the kabab, goes and puts our soft drinks on the bar. and then she is gone. We are eating and waiting for the drinks, nothing. So I got up and brought the drinks from the bar. Being the only ones in the restaurant, I knew that they were our drinks. why would we want to have our drink after lunch?? one of us ordered the home-made yogurt drink. it was just beyond bad. the yogurt they used was definitely molded and spoiled. 
The ghormeh sabzi had way too much beans in them, way too much. but it was good and the meat they used for the stew was good quality. 
we asked for Onion to have with our food. she forgot about it. we asked again, and she brought us a worst quality onion. you own a persian restaurant and this is the onion you bring for people?? come on. 
Tea was not hot and didn't taste good. 
Finally, the prices written on the menu were different from what we were charged. Soup was $4 on menu, we were charged $5, and appetizer was $6 on the menu, we were charged $7. We did not make a big deal about it, and paid, but that's just ethically wrong. A few dollars don't make much of a difference but it's not good business. I would not have written this bad review had they been truthful about koubideh and the prices. not good and won't go back there."}
{"text":"We have tried many persian restaurants in entire east coast, and being married to persian I know how good persian foods tastes, and this place was AMAZING!!!  Starting from appetizers, they were delish!! The lady who served was owner of the place and her service was magnificent!! She was very lovely, very organized and. Wright on time with everything. Service was outstanding and of course Td food too! Salmon kebab was perfect and soltani (beek kebab and beef skirt stake kebab) was amazing too!!! My husband said it tasted just like his mom used to make for him, that tell it all!!! Food was very good quality and everything tasted as suppose to!! Don't even try to go to Parisa, if you want real height quality persian food you have to come to Yas!!!  Just I wish it would be wright in the center of Montreal, but I guess we cant have it all. Strongly recommend!! Amazing chef, delicious food and best service!!!"}
{"text":"1. Fesenjoon : all crap !!! 
2. Hummus : the same with fesenjoon
3. Kashke bademjoon : very nice !!

Don't recommend here"}
{"text":"We stopped by in Montreal and had dinner at Yas, we tried different kababs including koobideh, barg and kabob torsh, food was very tastey and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely try it again!!"}
{"text":"We just finished having lunch at this beautiful restaurant and we totally enjoyed family-style dining and a personalized service. It's a family owned operation, and they work tirelessly to provide a warm and cozy atmosphere and it shows. Their food is made with love and it's great for entertaining groups. We highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Iranian halal food and was recommended to us by an Iranian.  We were a group of 7 and had lunch here. I tried their grilled beef which was served with rice.  The taste is amazing - smoky, tender and tasty.  For dessert, we opted for their ice cream and ended with Persian tea.  Service was attentive and our server was helpful in recommending dishes.  You can bring your own wines.  
Definitely returning here with my family."}
{"text":"I cautiously give it a four star but it's definitely more than a three. I am originally Persian so I eat Persian food on a daily basis. When it comes to Iranian restaurants there are two places I normally go. One is Quartier Perse and the other is Tehran, but I decided to give this place a shot even though the reviews were very split. 

Let's talk about the appearance first, it's relatively small restaurant, in a basement. Dress warmly if it's cold outside, as it's a bit frisky inside the restaurant. Minimal decoration but cozy and clean. 

Now about the food, the appetizers were very good, from the soup to the eggplant, to the warm bread they bring when u come in. Tasted better than in other restaurant i have  been. As for the main dish (kababs). The sour fillet mignon wasn't that great, I wouldn't recommend it. But the normal fillet mignon and the ground beef were good, very tasty. The rice however was overcooked and a bit smokey. I had only a spoonful of rice. Persian basmati rice is long grained and fluffy this was far from that. 

The tea at the end was very good. All in all, except for the rice everything was good. I would recommend it and am glad I tried it."}
{"text":"This is opposite of one expects from a restauarnt it is not worht the price or the money. The flavors are wrong and i cant agree more with the last review."}
{"text":"Loved this place! And everything about it :)
The service is really good and the food was so yummy! I love the desserts and the chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Such gracious owners, delicious food, and great service! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed by the kebab and taste (low quality beef with poor seasoning). Restaurant is quiet with almost no customers,which was a plus."}
