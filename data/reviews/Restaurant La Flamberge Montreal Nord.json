{"text":"Great restaurant in the east end! The food is fantastic. Manu choices are simple in the sense that you can find whatever is on the menu here...at any other restaurant. However, the quality of these \"simple\" choices are simply fantastic. I have yet to be disappointed. Their breakfast is finger licking good as well as their vast choices in desserts! Cheesecake after supper, anyone?"}
{"text":"Good decent Pizza but the delivery is horrible. Be ready to wait for 1 hour +. If they do not hire more delivery they might get 4 stars down the road."}
{"text":"We went there on our date night. Restaurant serves mostly anything and they have special dance nights on Saturday night (we were there on a Wednesday).

The good: My pizza-ghetti was good. Place looks nice. Waitress was friendly and checked on us a few times. 

The bad: My spouse's hamburger was not that fresh and the cheese was Kraft Singles. Desserts contains nuts, but NOWHERE WAS IT MENTIONED (good thing we are not allergic)! It took quite a while before we got our plates, and before we got our bill. Located in a shabby mall.

This is a place with it's regulars. Look also like a hit or miss place. And they missed with us."}
