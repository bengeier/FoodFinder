{"text":"For the past year or so, I've been meaning to go to Mitzi's Cafe for brunch.  Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.

I love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.

And like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).

Sitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.

As I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange/banana/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.

The glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.

This would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being."}
{"text":"After reading some great things about this place, myself and my boyfriend decided to check it out one Friday morning. I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. 

It helped that before we entered, there was a sign on the door up front saying that they only accepted cash, a bit of a nuisance, but better to know before you go in than after you've eaten your meal.

My first impression was it was very buzzy, great music playing and beautiful art work on the wall for sale to keep your attention. After putting our name down on the waiting list and waiting 20 minutes for a table (we played the cross-word while we waited) we were seated next to the kitchen, which is an open one.

The service was friendly and fast, although the table we were sitting at was a bit small. You can choose from ordering off their menu or from the blackboard above the cafe area. I found that the menu was a bit more simple to follow, whereas the board was a bit too confusing.

We both ordered the Mitzi's Breakfast Special ($6.95), coffee and a large glass of OJ (freshly squeezed, $4). We also found that sausage is not served here, but bacon instead. When asked why this was, the waitress simply said that they prefer to carry one type of meat. 

The wait was about 15 minutes for our food, but the art work on the wall kept us entertained. The food was absolutely delicious!! Where do I begin? The roasted potatoes, mmmmmm, nothing like I've ever had before. Roasted in some kind of pasta sauce with a hint of vinegar. When I asked the waitress for the recipe, she kindly said that it was a Mitzi's special and that it cannot be shared, smart girl! The bacon was oh so good with a hint of smokiness to it. The toast was pre-buttered (nice!) and our poached eggs were just right. And for $6.95, what a deal!! $24 total bill.

The only draw back to this place was the lack of ventilation. Because the kitchen is an open one, it got pretty warm and the faint smell of the cooking was left in our hair and clothes. 

All in all, a really great place with delicious, reasonably priced food! It's not surprising that it has spread to two other locations."}
{"text":"After attending a big fat Greek wedding ceremony down the street, my date and I were eager to find a quick bite before heading off to the reception which either promised to wow or unwow our grumbling tummies.   We gingerly entered Mitzi's amazed to find it was still open at 4pm for breakfast (our favourite meal!).

We were the only ones inside the resto, whilst others sipped on their dark blend outside.   The coffee is amazing.  I ordered a double Americana, and it was wowow, strong.  looooved it.  likely the best coffee I've had in a long time outside of my own little cafe (Chez moi).

he had the omelet & I had the poached eggs on seafood cakes (they are not made in house and I cheated and eat flour, I know, boo).  they seemed to be the safest thing on the menu without asking too much of the friendly chefs.

I'd heard alot about this little nook.  the food was sub-pare to me.  it lacked flavour.   It was, however, creative and appealing to the eye.   I'll likely never come back here.   It just wasn't that memorable. 

i know, you are wondering about the reception.  cocktail hour was amazing.   the dinner could have been served at any wedding reception.  

yawn."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and I was so impressed by their new fresh new look and decor, what a welcome change; it's so charming and certainly makes me continue to go back again for many reasons. 

Let me just say the food is delicious, the service is always friendly and their pancakes are AWESOME! A great neighbourhood spot to enjoy a lovely meal in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the way this restaurant has embedded itself into the residential community. Plus, the food remains superlative, if a little expensive. If you want a delicious brunch that's a little fancier than your local greasy spoon, but still not pretentious - this is the best place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Some good and some bad.  + Poached eggs nicely done.  Toast and fresh fruit good.  My wife had french toast which was good.  - Sausage was too sweet.  Had to send back a double espresso - no crema, very bitter.  Replacement drip coffee was really bad too.

Kitchen and washroom look clean.  Outdoor patio looks nice if weather cooperates.

Quality coffee is important; I am not sure this place would survive if it were on Roncy, in the Junction or on Queen.  For a nearby alternate, try Easy - both coffee and food are better."}
{"text":"I've been to Mitzi's a whole bunch of times, but the past two times I tried to go there this summer/fall I just walked out.

The service is just awful. No one who works there knows what is going on. One time I was there I was told to wait 15 mins for a table outside. So I sat on the bench outside and waited for about 30 mins. I went back inside, and at that point, said I would take any table because I was hungry (and there were 5-6 free tables inside). So I sat down inside. 20 minutes later I walked about because no one could bother to come by and take my order. I wasted nearly an hour waiting for a table, and finally gave up and went down the street to Easy. 

The second time I opted to take an indoor table and was told that they were short staffed so I would have to wait 15 minutes to order. After 15 minutes I asked if I could order and was told no, because she wasn't sure how long it was going to take. I waited another 10-15 minutes and then just gave up.

The food is great, but having to wait upwards of an hour and dealing with the staff is mighty stressful on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Tasty oatmeal pancake.  Delicious bacon. Exciting poach and scramble specials!

Why not 5 stars?  Well,  some may argue why I would generously give 4 stars,  taken that:

I love the food here when it hits my tongue but....I always get horrible cramps and the immediate need for a toilet within minutes after my last bite!  Gross,  I know,  but true!

How do I know it is specific to this place and not just my body's own (lack of) ability to properly digest bacon+eggs+butter+pancakes+etc?  I work at a breakfast joint (a real good one,  which I will not name as I am really not into 'shameless self promotion\")!  And,  I've worked at a few over the past 5 years.  Also,  I love to eat out in general,  especially breakfast/brunch,  and it pains me to say this place is the only that gives me such a tummy ache!

Can anyone relate!???

Otherwise, the food sure is tasty.  I would recommend (with warning) but after the probably 10th time of this happening,  won't be returning myself.
Though,  I've sure said that before.  

Service is good,  not great,  but better than most.  Good black coffee."}
{"text":"Mitzi's is an institution that has been around for a century in various avatars. It is a must-visit place if you want to garner any respect in the community especially the hipster/west-end culture which I associate myself with. It is fashionable to talk about Mitzi's and rave about this wonderful cafe in the middle of nowhere. The cafe is located on a quite side street that is a short walk from public transit on Lansdowne, Roncesvalles or Queen St. and there are sufficient reasons to make a trip here and be more socially acceptable.

I wouldn't go for their pricey food.

Mitzi's is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood so I imagine their commercial taxes must be low. Why, then, do they serve expensive food? I think it's the Apple syndrome; it's cool to eat here.

On the two occasions I went to this restaurant for weekend brunch I tried different items on their menu. I quite like their famous oatmeal pancake and several attempts to reproduce it at home have failed. However, it's inexplicable why you are given only one pancake for $14, drinks, taxes and tips extra. On my next visit I ordered the smoked trout and caviar. I was hoping for something distinctive but I thought that the preparation, although presented nicely, was mediocre in taste. I also tried few other dishes that my friends ordered, my favourite being home fries and toast. :-/

As for service, I thought it was directly proportional to your tip potential (ya, exactly what I mean) but who knows the place might just be busy. The cafe also prompted me to think of numerous first world problems, such as not having personal menus for each patron (it was quite entertaining to see people on the next table grumble about that - just read the chalkboard!). :-)

Having visited twice and earned sufficient social credit I doubt I'll go there again. Toronto has plenty of good breakfast options.

PS: Despite this review, I shamelessly admit to have fallen in love with their oatmeal pancake. In fact I am drooling (also shamelessly) as I write this...

cheers,
Priyank (http://finaltransit.com/)"}
{"text":"Cute, cosy, delicious! Expect lineups on the weekends. You have to try the famous Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancake...it is worth all the wait!.."}
{"text":"I came here for Breakfast the other day, its about  a ten minute walk from my house, there was a sign on the door saying cash only, so I had to walk to queen st to find an atm lol... then walk allllll the way back but the smells coming from mitzi's was great so I did it lol

The service was fast and welcoming, the ambiance was okay, and the wall art was awesome lol because there were big photos of Lego people in a restaurant and it was super cute. 

The food was good and left me satisfied, not too much and not to little...

The only thing that really bothered me was the fan system kept making this loud noise, and the chef would put a used towel on the sandwich counter and jump up on the towel to hit the fan system to make it stop... this is completely unhygienic and totally disgusted me... thankfully he didn't put my food on the sandwich counter but had I seen this before I got my food I would have walked out. Had I not seen this I would have given a higher rating."}
{"text":"This place is everything a breakfast joint should be. Great location, tucked away on a quiet corner in Roncesvalles. An eclectic mix of vintage table and chairs you'd remember from your grandmas house that are inviting, cozy, and make a great addition to the ambience of a local cafe. Breakie was a good sized portion, I had special which included poached eggs on chili, home fries (delicious), and sourdough bread (or rye). With a small fruit bite on the side for about ten bucks. all in all was exactly what I wanted for a chilled morning eat. Mind you, this was a Monday, and the place was almost at capacity.... I'd imagine wknds are quite busy.

Next time I'm in the area for breakie, this place will be at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately you have to be cool enough or look a certain way to get any service here. Boo"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great service. Nice place to start the day in the hood on a cold rainy day."}
{"text":"Food quality...just ok! Impersonal service. Cook, in street clothes, handled food with bare hands. Hygiene? No wifi. Expensive for the ambience and quality!"}
{"text":"NOTE: THIS IS A CASH ONLY RESTAURANT.

Mitzi's on Sorauren is perhaps my favourite brunch destination of all time - and I mean destination, in the way that people have destination weddings.  Unless you live in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood, you really have to go out of your way to get there, and people do.

Being tucked away in a residential area would make Mitzi's feel like a well kept secret, if it weren't for the young families constantly walking by, or the small crowds that wait outside for a table.

This place is small, and can only fit about 20 people inside and an additional 14 or so outside, weather permitting. Get there before 10 or after 2 if you must avoid waiting.  In my experience, the waits aren't too bad, and just lend more time to my friends and I to enjoy eachother's company.

What is lacking in space is made up for by the charm of the shared space with the cooks, the vintage tables, chairs and cutlery that don't ever match, and the ever changing art on the walls (minus one guitar made from one if the restaurants original frying pans).

After all this you could mistake me for going all hipster on this funky/cool/exclusive vibe, but make no mistake, MITZI'S IS ABOUT THE FOOD.

Have you ever had the perfect French toast with a creamy lemon-mint syrup? How about with roasted apricots and a grand marnier apricot-cream cheese drizzle?  How about the most delectable buttermilk oatmeal pancakes with a honey-toasted pistachio garnish and fresh strawberries?  You can chase these bites of heaven with their fresh squeezed juices, like mango-banana-orange, or raspberry-apple.  I'm not a coffee drinker but I'm told they make an excellent coffee as well.

Don't get married to the amazing meal you have on your first visit, because the menu is never twice the same.  It is a simple chalkboard with less than 10 selections that are constantly changing, and always delicious.  You can get a good idea of today's menu in their website at http://www.mitzis.ca/cafemenu.html but even today the site got the French Toast and Pancake toppings reversed, so be forgiving if it's not exactly right.

To wrap this up I will say this: Mitzi's makes the effort to create delicious brunches that are not likely something you've tried before.  Their ingredients are always fresh (their side melon tasted garden fresh, not like the crap from the grocery store), and they support local artists.  If you need to pull a great brunch plan out of your back pocket, this is IT.

Notes: My service is always excellent with one exception where the girl was very VERY bitchy and sitting at one of the tables with her own friends between serving customers. This was not a server I recognized and seemed to be an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Food's decent, service not bad, and they'll serve a child's meal size to anyone :-D

I was however a tad surprised that they were officially letting us know that they were out of freshly squeezed orange juice but had Tropicana as an alternate :-/

Their lemonade was not the best, however the scrambled eggs, toast, and fruits I got were very good.

The service was OK in that we were helped as soon as we got there. The food took a while to get there, however it didn't seem like it was the freshest (mostly looked pre-made).

It was like dining in a house in the middle of the neighbourhood which I kind of liked. I also liked their decorations along their walls.

The fact that they accepted cash-only was a bit of a personal turn-off. I didn't even see a nearby ATM, so if I didn't have enough cash, I would've had to go a bit a ways to the nearest bank to withdraw some cha-ching.

So all-in-all, my experience was so-so. Where or not I'd return is still a tad questionable based on my experience due to my mixed feelings, however they weren't all that bad either :-)"}
{"text":"In my eyes, there is only one meal of the day that is absolutely necessary. Brunch. I would happily live on pancakes, French toast, and eggs of any shape and style, if my waistline would allow it. 

Unfortunately, there just aren't enough all-day brunch places in Toronto where I can indulge in my desire to drink multiple cups of coffee and pile eggs on buttery toast. Thankfully, Mitzi's understands that people like me exist and they do a fantastic job of making my brunch-infused dreams become a reality. The poached eggs on crispy polenta, omelette's with chorizo and fresh spinach, and oatmeal buttermilk pancakes are scrump-dilly-omtious! 

I've also tried a few of the specials before, and sadly at one time the eggs were just far too cheesy (even for me), but other than that this place dishes out stellar...ahh...well, dishes. You will rarely if ever be disappointed with the food and never with the decor. Local artists work hangs on the walls, making this place not only eye-catching, but also engaging. If your breakfast/brunch date proves to be a bore, simply immerse yourself in the artwork around you. 

I give Mitzi's two thumbs up for representing creative minds while serving up some truly delicious morning eats."}
{"text":"Note: I've only been here for brunch. 

Okay, the food was fine, but I found that the servings were small and it was definitely overpriced. I've had equally good brunch in much cheaper places. Nothing amazed me about this place. It's cute and small but I don't get where the hype is coming from. We were both still hungry after eating brunch. He got a muffin and that was delicious. Maybe this is more of a place to pick up a coffee and a muffin?"}
{"text":"I love that this place is kind of hidden.  It's tucked away in a residential neighbourhood and kinda looks like a house, except that it's really colourful and has very clear signage.  Free street parking!!!

We didn't have to wait for a table at all, but from where I was sitting I could barely read the menu.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with mushrooms and was not disappointed.  The best part: it came with delicious asiago crisps!  

The place is small, so I was almost sitting in their kitchen.  While I partly enjoy hearing what the cooks have to say, I think I would prefer to be a little further.

They use a long church pew for seating on one wall, which I thought was very cool.  But I could see it being annoying to share.  Very cozy overall.  We were there really early, but I could see this place filling up quickly.

Probably a little difficult to get to by transit, so ask your car-owning friends to take you here."}
{"text":"Really cute neighborhood cafe! Great, laid-back, quiet place to catch up with friends.

Food was nothing special and about $2 more than I would've pegged it for but portions were reasonable and everything tasted good. We both got omelettes and they came loaded with Feta and spinach - delicious! 

Wait: it was a Sunday morning (10am prime brunch time) and as long as we were willing to sit outside, did not have to wait - if you want to sit inside prepare for a 45 min+ wait. Service was friendly, laid-back and excellent overall! 

Parking is also a tad difficult as there is no dedicated parking and most of the spots around the restaurant are permit parking/ already full. 

Overall, really quaint, cute, friendly and quiet place to spend the morning - would recommend!"}
{"text":"Oy, try the french toast.  Today's version included pomegranate seeds and syrup, fresh whipped cream and maple syrup.  It was accompanied by a generous garnish of assorted fruits and chunky \"home fries\" (more like roasted potatoes).  The coffee too, was excellent.

Two friends also enjoyed their basic breakfast specials, and one raved about the corned beef hash.

A nice vibe was supplied by 50's kitchen tables and chairs and good music.  The friendly and attentive server was also a plus.  I'll definitely go back with my lovely wife."}
{"text":"Loved their poached eggs with potatoes, fruits and toasts..it is a little shop right in between a residential area..  For two people we paid 40 with taxes so a little expensive but it is worth paying that much of money for a heart and stomach content brunch!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away in the heart of Roncesvalles, this place is always packed, and for good reason!

The menu is small but mighty. The vibe is relax. Our brunch was delicious and unique.

If you're in the area, this place is well worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for three years since reading an article about their amazing pancakes. We finally had the chance on Mother's Day and I'm so glad we waited. Even though the day was freezing it was sunny and still worth it to sit outside and do some people watching. I highly recommend going first thing in the morning because we were there an hour after it opened and we had to wait for an hour for a table. It was worth the wait - the oatmeal pancakes that I've heard about for years were absolutely delicious and because my husband is an amazing chef he figured out somehow to make them at home even though we didn't get any advice from the chefs. It's very casual place in a weird location - residence on Parkdale. I live in Unionville now but it was a nice reminder to make me happy that I no longer live in a goddamn Parkdale--- I finally moved out thank God. Both the chefs on the day that they cooked our food looked miserable and sported matching huge black eyes so I assumed that they got drunk and fighting the night before. I felt sorry for my assumptions when I learned the truth which was the night before they were walking home 10 PM from the restaurant and they got jumped/  attacked / mugged / robbed /beaten up. Is that enough reason for you to be happy you don't live in Parkdale ? Just visit during the daytime and watch yourself."}
{"text":"I'm not a religious person but almost became one after trying Mitzi's challah French Toast with praline toppings and a side of spiced potatoes. Holy mother...

It's a pricey place but you get what you pay for: huge portions of decadent brunch fare (I can't speak for their lunch or dinner offerings but I'm sure they're equally fantastic). I went for a marathon brunch with two friends and we were uninterrupted for the entire three hours we were there, except by the waitress occasionally offering re-fills on water and coffee. It was a nice change from Starbucks-type places where people ask you if you're almost finished with your table.

I thought Mitzi's residential location was particularly charming; it really felt like a place you would never know about unless you were a West End local (I'm not but my friends are). Also, I heard they used to be cash-only but now accept debit, so don't let that stop you from enjoying this adorable neighbourhood haunt.  Cozy, noisy and completely fantastic; make sure to wear your sweatpants!"}
{"text":"Wowow I am so glad I live right next to Sorauren Park and this lovely place! From the atmosphere to the food, everything is comforting and cozy. 

I've walked by so many times and there is always a pretty big line outside, so just from that you know it has to be good. 

Luckily when I went It wasn't too busy and we got a seat right away. They have a smaller menu which I actually prefer and on top of that they have a daily offerings board. Everything looked really good so I feel like you can't go wrong with whatever you order. Also the portions are out of this world, Just so much food! I got a chicken sammy and a salad thinking I wanted something lighter and wow I was so full after! But- good full not I hate myself full. 

I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in the Roncy/Parkdale area and you want something tasty."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast @ Mitzi's Cafe - a cute little place one block east of Roncey along Pearson. Good bold coffee! Thick slice of dark rye toast & sumptuous side of BBQ fried potatoes. The omelette was filled with pulled pork & cheddar, topped with a mango chutney - delish! Attentive service. A little of the beaten track, but worth the walk!"}
{"text":"Hmm... I guess the hipster crowd must have a case of Stockholm syndrome when it comes to this place. They've been held hostage so long to the lousy food, they're convinced it's true love. Because nobody could really love the God-awful food and lousy service in the heart of ersatz Brooklyn--AKA Roncesvalles. The kitchen is slower than molasses in January and the food is all just slightly weird. Who tosses broiled potatoes in vinegar? They do. I get that poached eggs will come overcooked more than half the time. So instead of complaining, I dispatch the overcooked eggs to a side plate and request a runny one, fully prepared to pay for it. The waitress relays my request to the sluggish cook who merely shrugs at the waitress then proceeds to pretend he never heard it. The waitress in turn pretends that the egg cooking is somehow underway. I grow weary of the charade and request the bill. Paying it, the waitress apologizes but doesn't bother to take the virtually untouched dish off the bill. She just assumed the stunned \"I am in Roncesvalles and I'm a hipster\" glare that is the hallmark of every Toronto diner that features candles in mason jars and ironic 60s coffee mugs from Value Village. And yet this review appears in a sea of raves. I don't know... maybe it's the whole brunch thing is just not for me. This restaurant's overwhelming smugness combined with total incompetence is DEFINITELY not for me."}
{"text":"Very cute neighborhood we found during our visit to Toronto. Took an uber to the location - but looked like parking may be difficult in that area. 

They food was very tasty. I ordered French toast and it was delicious. My friend ordered one of their egg dishes that was very tasty as well. The rosemary potatoes that came with it were cooked and seasoned very nicely. 

We arrived about 10-15 minutes after opening on a Sunday morning and had to wait about 45 minutes (very small location with about 6-8 tables). It was cold while we were there so unfortunately outside dining wasn't available. 

Would return next time in the area!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype and I'm here to tell you: ignore it. Unless you live in south High Park/Parkdale area there is absolutely no reason to come here. You can get just as good of a breakfast at any Sunset Grill chain in the city for half the price (and you get three eggs there). 

Service: Slow as syrup. They had 1 waitress working approx. 12 tables. To be fair we came on Remembrance Day, but you'd think they'd staff more for a weekday that a lot of gov workers and others have off. I only had my coffee refilled ONCE and I had to ask for it. My friend ordered a butter tart. That butter tart never made an appearance at our table. The food came out pretty fast though. 

Food: Only about 8 options to choose from. I got the traditional breakfast. It was standard in every way. Ordered my eggs over medium. I got over easy. Potatoes were hard. My friend got the same breakfast but with their homemade sausage (looked like mini pale thick burgers) she said those were good. 

Price: For two eggs, 4 strips bacon, two pieces of toast, a handful of potatoes, a few pieces of underripe honeydew melon, an orange slice, and a coffee it was $17. It should have been $10. I found a short white hair on my friend's toast and a short black hair (possibly cat?) on my melon slice. My friend has long black hair, I have red hair, neither of us owns a cat. 

Ambiance: Coffee shop feel. Close together tables, great for eavesdropping. Art on wall for sale. Cool light fixtures. Nice front window. They have a patio for summer. Free gum balls. The coffee mugs were pretty."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this place for years. Always consistent and the menu always changes. But good service and great quality food. It's a really nice treat to have one of the best brunch spots in the city within the Parkdale neighbourhood. Would not change a thing!"}
{"text":"Cute, small cafe which definitely gets crowded around brunch/lunch time. I ordered the traditional egg dish - 2 eggs any style, bacon, potatoes, fruit and toast and it filled me up. Wish the pricing was cheaper but the service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've been giving portions of my paycheque to the original Mitzi's Café on a near-weekly basis for several years now and it never gets old. It's my favorite brunch spot in Roncy/Parkdale and the only thing holding it back from perfection is the price ($13.75 + drink). That's why I recommend going in during the week if possible: you'll get a shorter wait and the menu is $2 cheaper across the chalkboard. And if you're a late riser like me you'll have the opportunity to try their lunch menu, which is only available on weekdays but is as good as the locally famous brunch options. (Try the fish cakes or the jerk chicken sandwich.)

Brunch-wise, the egg dishes are solid, but any first-timer has no choice but to experience the oatmeal pancake. Comforting doesn't even begin to describe this rich, oatmeal muffin-esque destroyer of paleo diets. Many calories. No regrets.

The six or seven options on the brunch menu are fixed, but the added flavours and toppings change weekly, which kind of makes it like a flavour-of-the-week club for regulars.

Service: Friendly and efficient!
Bonuses: Good coffee and free refills; cozy neighbourhood vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot! Super delicious dishes, we had a hard time choosing. I ended up going with the omelette which was just so amazing. My friends got the breakfast poutine which looked equally as delicious. 

Very fun spot to take people to that may want to see a more local side of Toronto. 

This is a super small place though.  Better for 2! We went on a Sunday and anyone more than 2 had to wait quite a while. They don't take reservations so definitely plan to come ahead of time if you're a group. 

The staff are super friendly and attentive though."}
{"text":"It was really tasty. They have an all day brunch menu, and some specials in the front. The patio was nice on a nice sunny day, but would have rather sat inside - except it was so hot and stuffy in there. 

I do like that is hidden, and I thought it was be a great place for some good food and a 'quick' lunch. 

Was a bit disappointed in the long service. Took about 25 mins before I got my food after I ordered, and there was only a handful of people there. I was on a time crunch and had to stuff my face to leave on time. 

I'm looking at their menu online, and I believe I got the Mitzi's Eggs Benedict, but I'm not sure. What I got was two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce, and bacon but drenched in meat sauce/oil with potatoes and one slice of orange. 
It's not at all what is described on the menu, but maybe I'm remembering in correctly. 

Nevertheless, the meal was flavourful, and rich. and but very salty. 

I'd definately come back again for lunchtime in the area. Free parking on the streets."}
{"text":"Lovely experience. Nice staff. 

There aren't many tables, and there was a bit of a wait. We were lucky that the sun was out and it wasn't too cold out. We ordered a coffee to wait with. It was nice and fresh. Their menu was also outside on a standing board with details and prices, so we knew what we wanted and were able to order fairly quickly when we sat down. 

I am a huge fan of their Scrambled. The chorizo and salsa on it was really good. We had the choice of sourdough bread or rye bread. Their potatoes are special but I wasn't a fan of it. 

Only thing that isn't great about this restaurant is the door.. it was a bit of a pain trying not to bother anyone that was sitting right by the door. It's a tight little area with a curtain to block the wind."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over a year because I moved across town, but when I did live in Parkdale, I came there often for brunch. I think it is high time I returned for a visit."}
{"text":"I had the Challah French Toast with toasted almonds and blueberry jam. Hot damn, it was good. Came with spiced potatoes on the side, which added a savory dimension to the overall flavour of the dish, making for a memorable flavour. I went at around 1 pm on a weekday. Last time I came here during weekend brunch I couldn't get a seat, but today there were only a couple other tables. I say give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It's a gorgeous summer Saturday, and after sleeping in to start the morning right my gf and I decided to go out and get some brunch at Mitsys.

Now to preface this we'd been here one time before and it was quite possibly the LONGEST wait for food that arrived cold.  But we got to eat outside and figured the cook/staff had an off day.  No harm.

Impossibly busy, TERRIBLE people management in not moving people out once they finish their food.  And all in all, 'meh' review of the food.  

Not gonna go back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Mitzi's in a really long time because I never had cash on me (they didn't take debit or credit before). Which was too bad because I loved their fishcakes, muffins and vibe. The other day I popped by and YAY! They now take debit! Sad to say but little things like that make or break whether I go to a place. Anyway, it was just as good as I remembered if not better. Great service, the decor is much better than before."}
{"text":"Take in Roncesvalles community culture through the large windows of Mitzi's Cafe, while enjoying their uber soul food menu. The bright purple and yellow cafe at the corner of Sorauren and Pearson invokes a homey, magical feeling.  

Had the Scrambled eggs with smoked ham and old cheddar. Very creamy eggs, cooked just right. Luxury scrambled is what they are. 

Sipped away at their signature juice (Banana/Orange i think) and its very fresh and tasty. Definitely made in house and none of that melange bs. 

Followed it up with an order of the infamous French Toast. It definitely met and exceeded my expectations. I would warn that it is more desserty than an actual  breakfast meal because its quite sweet with all that banana and chocolate syrup. But definitely a great dish. 

Prices are $2-3 more on the weekends but all very worth it. Portions are good and staff is attentive and very nice.

CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this neck of the woods, I wish I owned a house there..

I love everything about Mitzi. The homemade muffins, the strong coffee, the ultra-creative daily egg specials, the bountiful yogurt options and the non-matching mugs and tables. You feel like you're having brunch at a dear friends' house every time you come in.

Come for brunch and see for yourself. The best breakfast in the City Of Toronto!"}
{"text":"This cute tropical looking cafe is on my street and makes me feel like I'm in the Caribbean every time I walk on by.

I've only eaten there once because they are a gourmet breakfast joint and its pricey- but gourmet it was!  Fancy and fresh!

There is very limited seating so we had to wait a little bit... but it was well worth it.

I am a subscriber to their weekly menu... and I often lay in bed dreaming  about walking over and enjoying the Oatmeal Buttermilk pancakes with the latest craze of toppings they've conjured up. 

I would eat here more often if I could afford it!  Its a must try!"}
{"text":"what i love most about mitzi's is its healthy portions and their innovative tastes and styles.  the place has great omelettes, perfectly crispy bacon, and a great take on the accompanying potatoes with each breakfast.  they make  a great pancake and french toast;  the have freshly squeezed oj; the menu items change from week to week with their specifics so if you are a regular, itll always be like the first kiss.

i do feel though that the waits there are really long and it feels very crowded.  it has a very homey, hoboey kind of feel if that makes sense.  seems like all the cooks, waitresses, have dreadlocks.  dont really know if thats true, but it feels like it.
 
its on sorauren avenue, in between queen and dundas...kind of in the middle of nowhere.  so if you are in the hood, itll be easy enough to find and get to, but if you are coming from afar, not so easy or comfortable by bus, and parking isnt that much fun there either."}
{"text":"Really good brunch place. 

We got the pancake and the omelette special and they were both amazing. 4 stars for sure. The pancake was very unique and impressive!

Few things to note: small space but you get seated with 20 minutes max, the portions are large, there is good lighting but poor ventilation. 

Overall very happy with our brunch decision!"}
{"text":"I am a lucky, lucky girl, because I live 2 blocks from Mitzi's. What can I say about this divine diner? Well, this one time, they had a breakfast special, and it was french toast with poached pears and dulce de leche on top... That was like 2 years ago. To this day, whenever anyone says \"hey, wanna grab some breakfast?\", the pear dulce de leche french toast is all that I can think about . One of the best things I have ever eaten!!! And the whole place is just cute as a button. I love Mitzi's!!"}
{"text":"Very much a neighborhood brunch spot. The kitchen is open concept, menu is on a black board, and decor minimal, but cozy. The food was quite delicious. I ordered the poached eggs on an english muffin with a side of bacon. My friend ordered eggs and sausage (the sausage has a hint of sweetness which I liked). Both meals were delicious. Overall a very nice neighborhood spot. Note since its an open kitchen, you may walk out with clothes smelling like brunch."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and I loved it! A small place so had to wait a bit for a table, but everything is house made, and the menu is always changing, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just a stones-throw away from the main drag on Roncevalles, this resto is on the corner of residential streets. The hidden character of house-turned-into-restaurant makes it feel a bit small-town and bit like a west-end Toronto secret.

Tasty food and hot coffee. Daily specials, and good portions. When the weather is nice, there are several seats outside. The picnic bench is particularly friendly for the little ones.  

A must visit for breakfast loves in Toronto."}
{"text":"Place is small, so if you go for brunch on a busy weekend, expect a wait maybe.

Other than that, get the oatmeal pancake. Just do it."}
{"text":"Love love love this spot!!! Has a wonderful breakfast selection with classics and rotating specials. Good, healthy (read large) portion sizes. Also has a lunch menu but I e never been able to pass on the breakfast specials. Serve a great latte too. Patio had a few tables that are partial sun and shade. Be warned, they only take cash. But it is worth the walk to an ATM."}
{"text":"My nieces and I like the Pesto Chicken Club: a delicious double decker sandwich made with perfectly toasted sourdough, generous slices of roasted chicken, thick-cut bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and a very tasty homemade pesto sauce.  Served with salad and fresh fruit."}
{"text":"You need to be a local.....I guess.

\"Super cute spot\"?, yes it is. And brunch may be better than the standard breakfast, but at $21.39 for a latte, 2 eggs with bacon, potatoes and 2 pieces of fruit, and 30 minutes to get it, it's easy to see past the \"cuteness\".

Mitzi's is located among a quiet residential neighborhood....a great spot to chill with a coffee and maybe a muffin. There are approx. 10 tables and I can see how it can get busy, especially in the morning. Anyone living in close proximity would probably frequent Mitzi's for a coffee and maybe a pastry. It's a nice place to unwind and catch up on new Facebook posts or the latest news. But if you want a decent breakfast at a \"normal\" price with quick service, this may not be the place for you. 

After reading all the great reviews, I went out of my way to have breakfast at Mitzi's. And I could argue against myself that I was a) in a hurry, b) looking to be amazed or c) wanting to share in the hype, as the reasons why I gave it such a low rating, but the reality in my case was that a) the service was very slow, b) the food was not that great and c) it was about as expensive as the Ritz Carlton.

If you're in the area, drop by Mitzi's for a coffee and check the place out. However, if you plan on going out of your way to experience what the locals (who have written the awesome reviews) say is \"outstanding\", you may be disappointed.

If you want a creative breakfast, go to Easy on Queen and Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"I was really impressed.  I got the scramble and the young lady got the oatmeal pancake.  I was worried the portions would be small but I left very full.  The scramble was very good but the oatmeal pancake was really unique and worth going here just to check out.  Served with a sweet pecan sauce that is way better than just maple syrup.  $14 dollars for most of the mains so not bad for TO.  I'll come back no question.  And they were very attentive with coffee refills."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and delicious with spins on classic brunch dishes! Service is good, and fast. The patio was open when we came, so the wait wasn't too long for a Sunday seating at just before noon (the patio doubles seating availability), so we only waited about 15 minutes for a table.This place cost your average Toronto brunch prices, but it's what I expect for Toronto and for the atmosphere (it gets quite warm inside) 

We ordered two teas (just your regular boxed stuff), which came with extra water which is always a nice touch. 

The fish cakes were very good with a lot of fish in them and very flavourful with added tartar (which wasn't the usual tartar that I love, but still good) 

The poached eggs over spaghetti squash and a paprika aioli (healthy eggs Benedict) was DELICIOUS! the eggs were perfecty done, the squash as well, and the paprika aioli was super flavourful! It came with toast and potatoes (which were done withe caramelized onions...YUM) and fruit. 

The famous oatmeal buttermilk pancakes were delicious and more substantial than your average pancake. They came topped with a butter pecan cream (AMAZING, I WOULD EAT THIS ALL DAY) and a side of whipped cream and fruit and the same potatoes as above.

The omelette was an average omelette stuffed with lots of ham and cheese and covered in what tasted like cream of mushroom soup (though the description was much fancier). Omelettes for me have always been diet food (though admittedly, but the way this one was made), so id wasn't my favourite thing as there are so many other, tastier options...though, it was very good still and perfectly prepared with the same toast, fruit and potatoes. 

I'd definitely come back for the eggs, pancakes and the quaint atmosphere (how often do you find cute places in the middle of neighborhoods?)"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever! Everything else is excellent too. Tasty taters.  Good coffee.  Kitschy decor.  Friendly staff.  Tiny neighbourhood joint that's a favourite."}
{"text":"Fantastic people, food, ambiance, friends family and all in between.  Totally worth any wait."}
{"text":"Poached egg breakfast was fantastic. Fish cakes were a great value. Wasn't a fan of whatever brown sauce they used to flavour the potatoes"}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like pretending I'm part of a community -- you know that thing that has babies in strollers intermingling with cranky old ladies, dog-walkers, and stray cats -- I drag my misanthropic ass to Mitzi's cafe for breakfast or lunch.

 The homey place is small, friendly, loosey-goosey, and always packed.  Expect to have a solid meal,  expect to see many women who are expecting, expect to get service with a smile, but don't expect that smile to come very quickly, the staff is quite overrun.  

Mitzi's has good omelet specials and always has a selection of fresh juices, such as raspberry apple, or mango banana."}
{"text":"Gave Mitzi's a second chance and the service was a lot better this time!"}
{"text":"New favourite brunch spot! Such a hidden gem off of Roncys. Food was delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Pancakes with French toast topping of blueberry compote and cream cheese was delicious today.  Wonderful suggestion by the waitress as they were out of French toast.  Another great suggestion was to order a kids helping of the French toast as the regular portion is large and you need to be quite famished to finish it.  This place is one of my regular hangouts so will be posting more later."}
{"text":"Martin Luther King Day.  What better way to celebrate working for America than to brunch at a place that would be too busy for me to go to on the weekend.  How I love our staggered holidays.

The best:
The artwork.  There was amazing artwork here and I agonized over whether or not a purchase could fit in my January budget (it could not).

The good:
- The breakfast was good.  Specifically, the bacon was crispy and delicious, the eggs were soft poached perfectly and the toast was texas cut for dipping.

The okay:
- The hashbrowns were a solid okay.  I didn't love their texture, which is not crispy at all, but I did love their flavorful spiced topping.  If they could combine this flavour profile with a crispy outer shell, they would be excellent.  At this time they are neither here nor there.

The bad:
- There was rind left on my melon.  Not a huge deal but that's really the baddest thing that happened here.
- I have heard there is a huge lineup here on the weekends and I would never stand in line for this.  If I had had to stand in line, I would have rated this 3 stars.  No line = 4 stars.  Thanks again, MLK day!

Would I go here again on another American holiday when I was sure there wouldn't be a line?
Yes.  Under those circumstances I would visit again.  It's really far from my house and if it was closer to me I would consider checking it out more often, but at it's current location (aka middle of nowhere) I might go once a year."}
{"text":"Toronto is a city that serves breakfast well.  We visited Mitzi's on the wknd which is located off Queen St in a primarily residential area.  As we approached the restaurant, it  is obviously where the hip kids go to.  We didn't have to wait long, and because of the nice weather, they were still seating people outside.  After reading a few reviews, the oatmeal buttermilk pancakes were an obvious standout.  They came with espresso cream, pecans, maple syrup, and whipped cream, which came to $13.95.  I was surprised that there was only one cake, usually for that price, there would normally be a small stack.  The pancake was fluffy, and the addition of the oatmeal surprisingly didn't make it dense.  It was topped with a delicious espresso cream, which is an original flavour profile for a breakfast dish.  The pecans and maple syrup went together beautifully.  The whipped cream was unnecessary, it felt redundant to have it along with the espresso cream.  We also had the scrambled eggs with green onions, old cheddar, and bacon for $13.95.  The dish unfortunately was a total flop.  The dish arrived cold first off.  There were too many green onions,  i liked the flavour but they were too large to be cooked through, so they were mostly raw.  The old cheddar was good, but should have been melted.  Thankfully it came with fruit and potatoes.  The potatoes were hot, tender, but they needed more seasoning.  

For the service, we waited over 35 minutes to get our two dishes, and one was cold.  Also, i know that it is Toronto, but the prices were way too high.  The quantity didn't justify the price, and i felt kinda ripped off.  

Overall, i really liked the food, and i loved the overall feel of the restaurant, but if you factor in the long wait times, and the cost, I don't know if i would come back.  BTW, they are cash only!!"}
{"text":"The first thing at the top of the daily menu caught both of our hungry eyes and it was as easy as that - \"two poached eggs, please!\". Perched atop a sweet and chewy Montreal bagel, the perfectly yolky eggs were topped with thin slices of smoked salmon and finished with a thick dollop of dill cream and was exactly what we needed on one of those morning afters. The heavily spiced chunky red potato home fries, thick and evenly buttered sour dough wedges, and too-good-to-remain-garnish assorted fruit slices all added up to make one food coma-inducing meal. 

My lazy brunch date and I had thought that it was a surprisingly quiet weekend afternoon when we arrived, but what we didn't realize until we were politely asked to settle our bill (because they were shutting down the register) was that we had unwittingly been those annoying customers who walked in just at closing time. In any case, the service was still excellent and we weren't rushed at all. 

Not long after we were sat, we ended up having the warm, colourful restaurant all to ourselves. It felt a bit like we were just hanging out in our adorable little breakfast nook, drinking tea from mismatched mugs, listening to vintage vinyl and letting our hired help do the mopping of our checkered floors.
 
Sitting by the storefront windows was the perfect spot for people watching on this rainy afternoon. Worry not if that table has been nabbed by the time you arrive at this consistently busy spot though, the ever changing art for sale on the walls is always interesting to look at too."}
{"text":"Mark my words - weekday brunch is the next big thing!

Stopped into Mitzi's on a quiet Monday morning for a quick bite before my flight to NYC.

Plenty of seating available and no line up (best things about weekdays!).

We ordered the traditional breakfast (2 eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon) and the eggs benny.  Food came quickly after ordering.  

I always order my bacon extra crispy and there are very few places that can do it perfectly.  Mitzi's is one of them.  Potatoes were coated in a savory BBQ sauce which was also different.  And both brunches came with a hearty side of fruit slices (melon, grapefruit and orange) meant for eating, not just garnish. I totally respect that.

Downside of Mitzi's:  1.  It's not well ventilated.  The smoke and fumes from the grill top were overwhelming.  My eyes were starting to water and my hair/clothes were coated in a eau de breakfast.  If had been warmer, we would have sat outside to avoid it.  2.  The price.  Each entree was $14 (coffee not included).  With tax and tip, we were up to $20/person which is on the pricey side for an average weekday brunch.

I'd probably pass on coming back as there are plenty of other options in the 'hood and vincinity."}
{"text":"Great chill vibe on a rainy day. Home cooking right on the corner of a residential area."}
{"text":"3 to 3.5 stars... It helps to be a regular here to get better treatment.  Maybe it's an off day but flavours were decent but waiting for 45 minutes for pricier ok brunch dishes keeps this a 3 stars.

I have a hard time writing this review as this place seems like a local gem and the regulars who know the staff by name clearly get the better treatment.  I'm not a local nor a regular so we didn't experience the 4++ star treatment this place seems to give others.

It is cute... absolutely.  This is a very small cafe tucked away from Roncy main street and in a very quaint quiet neighbourhood.  We arrived before it opened at 9 am and already there were a group waiting before us.  By 9 am arrived, at least 5 groups were ready to be seated.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the sun as we waited... and waited... and waited for our order.

The menu is small and changes weekly which makes it a good place to enjoy new flavours.  It has an omelette, scrambled eggs, poached egg, pancake, french toast, and traditional breakfast option.  No prices were listed on the chalkboard menu but it seems every dish is $14.  We opted for a strawberry greek yogurt french toast, their Mediterranean omelette, side of bacon, and juices ($4.5 each).  We ordered pretty much within minutes of sitting down and we didn't get our dishes until 45 minutes later.  We noticed one table ordered after us and they were on a first name basis with the staff.  They clearly were regulars and got their order a little after 15 minutes.  

French Toast - We've had great French Toast at Rasa, Insomnia, and Le Baratin with Le Baratin being the 5 star level.  When it first arrives, it looks good but after the first bite, unfortunately Mitzi is not at the same level... the french toast was bone dry in the centre.  The custard did not get through even a quarter way through the bread.  There was a few strawberry pieces but they were mostly white and tasteless.  Sure you get 3 fairly big pieces but it like eating toasted wonderbread with a bit of sugar. It did come with some fruit (melon and pineapple slice) with some boiled potato with a few spices thrown in.  The spices saved the potato.  3/5

Omelette - This was another large serving where it looks impressive at first.  It had a large omelette with toast, slice of melon & pineapple, and a few spiced boiled potatoes.  A good omelette is supposed to be creamy and luscious as it creates wonderful egg curds cooked at a low temperature.  After the first bite, it was bland and rubbery... it looked like it was overcooked.  I will say the cooked cherry tomatoes, olive tapenade, and feta was fairly generous and did try to help elevate the flavour but I didn't want to eat it the rest of it. 3.5/5

Bacon - 3 pieces for $3.5?  I think we got 5 larger well cooked crisp pieces for the same price at our favourite places.  3/5

Juices - These were very tasty but I dont think you can goof up fruit?  At $4.5 each for small bar cups, it was pretty price.  3.5/5

This place was super busy and have much love from the locals.  Seeing how one of my favourite amazing brunch places, Le Baratin, has better service, tastier, and all around amazing within a 10 minute drive, it makes it really hard for us to give this place another try.  I know The Federal and Ace is nearby, and we'll probably give them a chance before this place."}
{"text":"Popped in to Mitzi's around 11:30am on a holiday Monday, and while there was a lengthy line for a seat on the patio, there was a small 2-top available inside. Too hungry to wait, we opted for the free table, oblivious to the fact that it was swelteringly hot and stuffy inside (although, to my dismay, this would become clear to me very shortly after sitting down). 

After we were seated, we proceeded to wait about half an hour for anyone to even come over to our table and explain the menu (there are no menus, only the chalkboard up front). Then we waited again for someone to come back and take our order, after which we waited another 30 minutes or so for our food to come out. The combination of hot and hungry isn't a good one for me, so I was hoping that my food would at least be worth it.

I opted for the omelette special -- balsamic roasted portobello mushrooms, spinach and goat cheese with a corn and tomato relish. It came with the option of rye or sourdough toast, some fruit, and homefries. While the omelette itself was decent, the homefries tasted old and waxy, and for $14, the portions are a touch on the small side for brunch. My boyfriend had the breakfast special and requested his eggs over easy, and they came out completely overcooked, with only the slightest hint of runny yolk. 

Service seemed totally disorganized, with the cooks coming out of the kitchen to clear tables and deliver plates, and dirty plates left on tables for far too long. As others have mentioned, location is great and the space is lovely; it's a shame that my high hopes were dashed by the food and the service. 

Note that Mitzi's is no longer cash only, and does accept debit and credit cards."}
{"text":"A place automatically enters my good books if it's open early on the weekends, as I like to the avoid ravenous hipster brunch crowd (RHBC) if at all possible. We strolled into Mitzi's early (09:30) Sunday morning and though the place was already bustling, there was no line up. Vivek gets very testy -- and speaks in the third person -- when he has to wait for his breakfast.

It's a tiny spot with probably 25-30 seats at most. We scored a spot by the counter where they cook the meals. I chose the smoked trout and caviar omelette, while my brunch partner opted for scrambled eggs with mushrooms and asiago crisps. If it were a competition, she would have won handily; the scrammies were perfect and the asiago crisps were OTH. My omelette on the other hand was subpar. It has a weird texture and was difficult to cut. (Overcooked perhaps?) And I can't say the roe helped any. The highlight of my meal was the homefries; basic potatoes tossed in delicious flavour, though I wish they were crispier.

Given their accomodating schedule and affable vibe, I'll return. But I will be a bit more choosy next time.

Obligatory Title Pun: MITZ the mark, slightly.

Menu Readability: None! Choose your options from a board.

Need to mention: This place is a bit out of the way. If you find yourself in a residential tree-lined neighbourhood with no other businesses in sight, you're on the right track.

What this place teaches me about myself: I assume everyone uses AF to decode acronyms."}
{"text":"I admit, this review might be tinged with the memory of my stomach growling as I waited to be seated for what seemed like a score (ahem - 20 years).

That being said - I guess that is partly what Mitzi's is all about.  20 people sitting & eating brunch in tight quarters.

My meal was delicious.  I got their 'famous' oatmeal pancake with the choice topping of cookie dough.  In fact, my new life slogan might be that 'everything is better with cookie dough on top'.

I wasn't particularly wooed by the servers, who seemed ready to bring in the next round of people when I would prefer to enjoy my last cup of coffee.  I felt like it was pricey for what it was, but again - I guess you're paying for the privilege of being there.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Really cute place tucked into the heart of Roncesvalles, with not a lot of seats but a surprisingly short wait.  I ate some scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, cream cheese and dill which was fantastic -loxish, if that is a word.  Side of BBQ-ish homefries were good.  Toast was average.  However, the raspberry lemonade was super yummy!!  Wait staff were friendly.  If you drive there is a ton of parking along the side streets.  The only thing preventing me from giving this a five star rating is if they accepted credit cards/debit cards.... a little bit of a pain, but otherwise, this place can be classified as yumtown."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the larger Mitzi's Sister on Queen, Mitzi's is a tiny cafe tucked away on Sorauren Avenue in the middle of a completely residential street, and I'd like to say it's a secret, but judging by the Aunties & Uncles-esque wait times on a Sunday morning, clearly it's not. There are a few tables indoors and then a picnic table and small patio area but I'd say the capacity of the whole place is 30 people at most. 

The Mitzi's spot has existed since 1905 and when it first opened it was a grocery store that sold milk for $0.15, later renamed \"Sorauren Grocery\" and then \"Superior Groceries & Meat.\" It became Mitzi's Café in 1996. 

There are no paper menus and the selection is limited to about seven or eight breakfast items that are outlined on a chalk board. I ordered the poached eggs (my favourite!) on spiced black beans with tomatillo salsa, sour cream, lime salted tortilla chips and home fries ($13.95). Absurdly pricey for breakfast/brunch but at least the portions are big. 

The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and the spicy black bean mixture was ungodly good. The potatoes were smothered in some sort of savoury sauce that tasted a smidge like tamarind but the server couldn't confirm it as it's a \"secret recipe that only two people know.\" I was personally not a fan of the tomatillo salsa but it may have been psychosomatic - I just couldn't get past the pale green/snot-like colour. It sort of reminded me of relish, and really, who likes relish?

Service is on the slow side despite the ample staffing and small number of patrons - I got the impression by today's visit that a lot of the customers are locals and regulars, so it makes for a lot of chatting/catching up that results in less attentive service. It took so long to get our bill sorted I felt like perhaps I had missed a memo about paying at the counter or something.

Cash only."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Mitzi's. Their pancakes rock, or used to. There's been some ownership or staff change (as the waitress explained) and my last two visits have been very disappointing. Not the same Mitzi's. The last time they put sour peach candy on my pancake and black licorice on my friend's. Maybe this was because of Hallowe'en coming, but candy at 8am, not appetizing to all."}
{"text":"Sun dappled french toast on a beautiful Thursday morning before hitting the road to Niagara wine country.  The Toronto winning meal streak stayed alive at Mitzi's.  Sure the price was a little steep, but damn if these weren't some of the most delicious slices of french toast I've ever had.  These were perfectly cooked with that toasty, almost crisp exterior and that sweet, soft interior -- not soggy in any way shape or form.  The topping of nuts and this almost icing like deliciousness put it over the top.  Excellent hefty chunks of fresh fruit came with it and the couple bites I stole from gf's avocado eggs were amazing.  The potatoes couldn't quite compete with what Aunties and Uncles has going on but for home-fry style they were indeed top-notch.

I enjoyed the out-of-the-way location and the quiet little room. It felt like we'd already left the city even though we only had to drive a few minutes to get here. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Little neighbourhood brunch places are the best places. This little joint is tucked away between parkdale and roncy. 

Daily menu is on the chalkboard and has a small offering. Which mean all the choices are delicious! No alcohol choices but the coffee was tasty!  

I had the scramble with sourdough toast. The portions were great and ingredients fresh. Shoutout to the jalapeño aioli! Especially tasty! I want that on everything! 

I can't wait to go again and try the French toast!"}
{"text":"I liked the other reviews on this place - they said most of the good stuff but I wanted to add my thoughts such as they are. I split an order of pancakes and an order of eggs benny with a friend. We quite liked the place in general and had a great 30 minute chat while waiting outside on a Sunday at 10:30. Note: It is worth showing up at 9am to avoid lineups if you can. The pancakes were excellent - thick and fluffy but tasted suspiciously nutritious as well. Sadly there is only one pancake served. The eggs were perfectly done but served on a little crouton of sorts which was covered in something that included finely minced raw onion - which was likely done nicely but I'm not a raw onion fan. Since I was enjoying my conversation I did not mind the slow service. The coffee was nice and the staff were great given the pressure of the people waiting. It is very simple food in a very simple setting at reasonable prices. All simply pleasing."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite breakfast joint in the West end. Their weekly specials are so delicious!"}
