{"text":"Personally, I was very disappointed in this place. So disappointed, that it made me go and write a review for the very first time. The lady working here was absolutely rude to my party. They actually served us the softest crepe ever when we asked for extra crispy. On top of that, I personally feel that they purposely served us a bad crepe because we brought outside drinks in... even though there were no signs to prohibit it. Instead, the owner took the sleeves from my drink and switched it with theirs. Rudeee!!!! As ridiculous as that sound, the comparison between the crepes that was served to us and the crepes served to other customers were completely different. It was also super overpriced... About $15 a crepe and that's not even \"fully loaded\" with all toppings included. I will never return here again."}
{"text":"Me & My wife really enjoyed the food. Specially, my wife is a vegetarian and very picky. Even she enjoyed the food. Their fresh orange juice is the best one. Basically healthy food.  Friendly and courteous service. We will recommend to any one."}
{"text":"We walked in at 9:20pm and tried to find what we wanted so we looked it up on Yelp.  A lady came by and said, \"i know you are looking at the picture online but we are different from the other restaurants, i can explain to you if u have any question.\" i feel that she thought we didnt even know what crepe was and we had to look it up online.  NO, we were looking at the pictures from Yelp about your food! You dont know there is a Yelp app?    Then, she told me that it was good that we were going to order dessert because she had closed the other part of the kitchen.  Your sign said that the place is closed at 10pm and you were still playing live music at 9:30pm and u told me you were closing when i was ordering?  Was it a nice thing to say to the customer? Not really.   Besides they didnt get me the hot coco that i ordered, when i was cleaning up their toy because my son was crying, this french looking man came to me and asked me, \"can u take your son outside?\"  i was thinking my son was crying for less than 2 mins and the table next to us didnt even turn their heads because the music was so loud.  We had paid and i was cleaning up the toy for u and get ready to leave.  What was the problem?  Do they really know customer service?  Not really.    Food wasnt great, pricy and service SUCKS!"}
{"text":"This is the first review I ever wrote. My wife, son and I went here for dessert after having a bad experience at an other restaurant hoping to save our family night out. We were both very impressed from the moment we walked in. We were greeted by the chef who walked us over to a table near a play area for kids. There was a live band playing jazz by the front door. Our son saw the toys in the play area and was set for the rest of our stay. I am not very good at describing food so all I can say is that our crepes were delicious. The staff was very friendly. They have all sorts of activities throughout the week for kids. My wife and I were able to enjoy our crepes while our son played in the play area about ten feet away from us, so we never had to take our eyes off of him. When we were done with dessert, my wife and I sat for a while and played in the play area with our son who didn't want to leave. Good food, friendly staff, kid friendly and good ambience all make for successful dining experience."}
{"text":"Why yelp has to force someone to leave at least a star? I wished I could give this place a negative star if there is an option for that. Service is terrible and so does the crepes. Ordered the Monaco (the one with the creme burlee) and it was really just throwing a creme burlee on top of a piece of crepe. And the owner said \"our crepes are special and you can't find it anywhere else\". And the service? The guy who served us was an idiot. We ordered couple crepes for everyone to share. When the crepes come, he bought only 2 plates for 4 people? Is he expecting I eat directly on the table? Overall experience is not good and there are many other crepes places around town that deserve customer business."}
{"text":"There are so many good things about this quaint little restaurant that I can't bring myself to give it a bad review for the not-so-good qualities.   I loved the ambiance (live violin music), large variety of sweet and savory crapes, good for breakfast or lunch, good happy hour prices, vegan and glutton-free options.   The service was positive but very slow.  Our waitress forgot what we ordered although the place wasn't too busy, the cauliflower soup looked good but it was flavorless, and the server refused to give us tap water, she said they only have bottled water (really?).    We'll definitely come again and try different menu items."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a smoothie after a class at kidville with my two young children. We are all violently ill after sharing a few sips of smoothie before I threw it out because it didn't taste right.  Called to let them know to hopefully prevent this from happening to any one else. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is the best brunch I've had in a while! Don't let the name fool you, this definitely isn't a typical Crepe Shop.  The food is truly phenomenal! I had the Manhattan, which is a twist on a Benedict breakfast. My husband had the Italian Crepe which is served with a wonderful cheesy, meatball Italian soup, everything bursting with delicious flavors.  We will definitely be back!  They also have different events, like weekly art & wine nights (free wine tasting while browsing/shopping a featured local artist); and tango nights with dinner and dancing.   I like the unique vibe and offerings, atypical and completely unexpected."}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes for a crepe. Not impressed with savory crepes. Seemed unorganized, but servers were friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the best I have ever being the service is amazing the owner it's just an amazing and kind person and the taste of the food it's out of this world spices feel authentic and the environment it's vintage meets classic, kids friendly and pocket friendly too best place I recommend it for a place to spend your afternoon or have a girls/guys night out  they have live music and cooking classes this place has it all"}
{"text":"Love this place for their customer service and crepes but, DO NOT EVER order their gelato!!! $3.78 for three bite serving!!! I should of checked the container before I left! I work in Tivoli and was craving ice cream! If I wasn't all the way back to my office and wasn't craving it so much, I would definitely take it back and ask for my money back and drive to vons and buy an entire gallon for this price!"}
{"text":"This bistro is on top of my list to visit when I am in Vegas.  It is my favorite breakfast place in US! I love a good Benedict, and their Manhattan Crepe (ham, potatoes, poached eggs, spinach, topped with hollandaise) is out of this world. Very clean and modern, the atmosphere is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Dined with my friends at The Crepe last night, and we were all delighted with our choices.  Wonderful flavors and a lot of choices, both savory and sweet.  Several of us lean toward a vegetarian preference, and Agnes had an off-the-menu couscous/eggplant option, so be sure to ask if you have a special request.  Nice atmosphere and they're connected to the community by supporting local artists and musicians."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  We came in and we're asked by chef to sit in the back, because we were with children!!!  No waiter came to the table to take our order for 10 minutes, so when I asked about it, was told that waiter would be with me in a minute, however it took another 10 minutes. After waiting for the order for 30 minutes, checked on this and we're told that the next is ours. But next order was taken to another table that was brought to customers who came after us. So, checking on this again and are told that they are too busy! The place was not even half full! Wanted just to pay for drinks and leave, however they have complemented drinks.  After almost an hour at this place left angry and hungry."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had a good coffee break time in here  Very comfy , very friendly owner , next time I will try their crape !"}
{"text":"Why does one go a restaurant? For food. What does one expect? Tasty food, good service, reasonable prices, enjoyable atmosphere.  The Crepe scored 1 out of 4 for my husband and myself. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the owners are  loveliest guys! That's it.  We stumbled into here by chance, coming down from the upstairs and frankly, it took us a while to realize we are in a cafe. The performing band made us stay. Hubby ordered a Moroccan crepe, cuz he is form Morocco and was expecting authentic home-cooked goodie. Failed expectations. The stew in the crepe tasted like nothing traditionally  cooked in Morocco...  I ordered either a Polish crepe and could not finish it, too much of sauerkraut. And I love sauerkraut and sausage! We paid about $40, took home the remaining of our crepes, but it ended in the trash."}
{"text":"I've been here various times, the service is typically good, the food better and for $20 you can get 1 savory and 1 sweet crepe. I recommend the Venice- It seems very sweet but it's actually very balanced so you're not overwhelmed and the Thailand which is a curry crepe that I found delicious.   And not only do they good crepes they have musicians playing most days and paintings from what seem to be local artists. If you want alcohol you will need to specifically ask for that menu because the one at your table is usually a virgin list."}
{"text":"I come here every time I visit Vegas because the food is absolutely delicious and the owner treats everyone like family. The Crepe is such a unique experience that everyone should try at least once. My grandma is a regular here, and it is no surprise to me why. Whether you are having Breakfast, lunch, a cup of coffee, or dessert the Crepe is perfect for all occasions. On this visit we just came for coffee but ended up trying the new special Tiramisu dessert and omg was it AMAZING. I would definitely argue that this place has the best desserts in all of Las Vegas. The head chef Alexandra is very friendly and will always take care of you. Never hesitate to ask for anything everyone at the restaurant is always there to lend a hand. Our server Sage was extremely nice. They messed up my Mom's latte and without hesitation they took it back and made her and myself a brand new one! I did not even need a new latte but they insisted on making sure it was \"made with love\" and I had so much respect for that. I could go on and on with all of the wonderful things I could say about the owner and staff. Overall, this place is as good as it gets for unique eats and is without question a top restaurant. Thank you Alexandra!!"}
{"text":"Visiting for a conference and staying in the Summerland area. I wanted a gluten free, healthy, lite breakfast with a good latte and at the same time enough for my husband to be satisfied; The Crepe was perfect!!! The owner was wonderful and beyond accommodating and attentive. I would recommend visiting and experiencing one of the many crepes that are themed by different countries."}
{"text":"The owner makes best crepes in town. And the menu has so many different options savory and sweet. I definitely recommend this crepe place. It's always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Worst crepes ever ( no taste), very expansive for a bad crepe ( $12-13), the service was really bad as well and not friendly."}
{"text":"Saturday mornings in our family are spent looking to discover new restaurants. We stopped by The Crepe and sampled four crepes, breakfast and dessert. The crepes were good, there was live entertainment for the children, and a friendly, passionate owner. Having to pay for water and coffee refills makes for a higher than average bill for a party of four for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love crepes.  And when I found out that a new place called The Crepe opened up at Tivoli Village, I was super excited to try it. Right next to Brio and very casual. The service was excellent, the prices were very reasonable. I had a difficult time choosing what breakfast crepe I wanted.  I finally decided on the USA, which is basically Benedict florentine on an open faced crepe. Superior presentation and phenomenal taste. The chef and owner came up to our table to ask how we liked it and you can tell she is very passionate about her culinary skills.  Everything is made with love. I can't wait to go back. Oh and the coffee there is the best I've ever had. I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The Crepe and Tivoli village is horrible...the owner has a bad attitude and the service was just as bad"}
{"text":"This place is so cute ! I come here at least two times a weeks ! Food and coffee is great ! The owners are so nice and will always make sure your happy ! They have a cute play area inside for kids"}
{"text":"I ordered the Germany crepe. It was so intense! Sauerkraut, mustard, and pickles. All that acid kinda made made my stomach hurt. Which is strange because I love those ingredients. It was just too much. It looked very nice Though. My boyfriend got the  Italy which was somewhat plain. I was expecting a lot more cheese and maybe some more prosciutto. It was mostly just egg. We asked for water and he brought us a bottle of water and then charged us. We would've been OK with tap we didn't ask for bottled water. Then we had the nonalcoholic drinks which really sucked. It tasted like watered down juice. I hope it was just a bad day. It was a cute venue."}
{"text":"It's next to my house, I should be jumping for joy with a creperie next door, but this place is a huge disappointment.  I've been here a few times, so it's not just one time bad experience.    Service and decor are nice, selections are also big, which is good.  But the crepe itself it mediocre at its best.  A perfectly cooked crape for me is a little crispy on the edges and still light and fluffy like a crepe should be.  The few times I've tried here, they're usually OVERCOOKED.  Most of the time I couldn't even cut with my fork or even having hard time with a knife, it's not acceptable to me.    I think if you like a bunch of nutella and whipped cream smothered the crepe so you're eating the sauce and not the crepe, this might be the place for you.  Or sometimes people get too excited to think it's a crepe place and they're eating crepe, but don't know what crepe is supposed to taste like.   I've had a lot of crepes in my life all over the world, this is probably the worst crepe place I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"My friend and I had the Provence crepes and they were absolutely fabulous.  Fresh herbs, sautéed onion, goat cheese and brie.  Our server recommend dijon with the crepes and it was amazing.  Our Cafe Americanos were delicious.  I just had my leftover half crepe from yesterday and it was still amazing.  We had great brunch and friendly service.  Please, give this place a try.  It was a little pricy, but they have an amazing selection of crepes and our brunch was delicious."}
{"text":"Love it. Mexico is awesome. Greece is good if u have the craving. Small coffee shots for quick pick me up."}
{"text":"The good: the owner is nice, the ambiance is pleasant. The crepes themselves (just the crepe, not the ingredients) were good.  The bad: the food. Much of it is frozen and/or canned, which is a bit disappointing for the price. We ordered the St. Tropez (sweet crepe, with orange juice, pears, and whipped cream). The menu says \"caramelized\" but the pears most definitely were not - they were likely dumped straight from a can onto the crepe. On that type of dish, the whipped cream makes up a large proportion of the total ingredients, which means that it matters to the overall quality of the dish.   Actual conversation with server:  Server: \"how was your crepe?\" Me: \"It was okay.\" Server: \"What was wrong? What could have improved it?\"  Me: \"You don't use real, fresh whipped cream.\"  Server: \"What do you mean? We use fresh Reddi-Whip from a can.\"   Ah, fresh reddi-whip from a can and canned pears with cheap orange juice. It wasn't horrible (we ate it) but it wasn't worth almost $12 and we won't be back.   Finally, the servers are attentive to the point of being intrusive. We had FIVE different servers come by to try to take our orders before we ordered, and then AFTER we ordered we got at least three other interruptions from servers asking for our orders. I understand they're trying to be attentive and I applaud the effort but ultimately execution is all that matters and they fail dismally. No patron wants to be interrupted throughout their every 3 minutes by servers, period."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast for my girlfriend's birthday and they treated us like royalty. The food was excellent and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Bad service, period.  We were the only customers and they could not have been more dismissive of us. For instance,  I had to get up to ask for a refill of my ice tea.  My wife and I just sat there confused about the poor service. It was almost surreal. The crepes were OK, but way overpriced."}
{"text":"Great place, I liked the food and the service. The owner even stopped by to say hello and introduce herself. Very warm atmosphere. They also did special meal for my extremely picky kid."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I ordered The Alaska, which was a breakfast crêpe infused with smoked salmon and cream cheese. It was definitely worth it, and the service was great along with the mom-and-pop vibe. It was definitely a five star visit.  Now, the second time I came here, I ordered The Milano, which was decent. It was filled with a balsamic reduction with tomatoes and mozzarella. I just felt like it wasn't enough food (especially for the price). It was mostly crêpe, which actually tasted a bit bland, and the presentation wasn't the prettiest. On top of that, the service wasn't so great.  Then, I ordered The Europa to split, which ended up satisfying my crêpe craving. Overall, I would still come back for another try, but the service mostly affected my experience here."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try something new and came here on Sunday.  We were warmly greeted as we entered and were assisted with seating.  The owner and staff were all extremely friendly.  We both loved our crepes and coffees.  My absolute favorite part about this restaurant is how kid friendly it is.  We have an 11 month old and she happily played with another little girl while we ate and actually enjoyed our meal!  The owner also brought a baby plate and offered making our daughter scrambled eggs.  Overall, great food, service, and atmosphere.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the crepes that Agnus prepared for my family and I.  Really great customer service and delicious food! Unfortunately we live in Texas but if I ever return to Vegas I'm definitely stopping by here again!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often, but this was a special case that needed a review! We were a little hesitant when we went in because we were greeted but didn't know how to order, it says seat yourself, but what if we wanted take out? Even when we asked how to order they told us to take a seat as if take out wasn't an option. Then we ordered a couple waters and our meal. The waiter came back with two bottles of water and we said no we would just like tap at which point they informed us they didn't have tap! WTF?!!! Isn't that illegal for a business not to have free water available? The crepes came and they were delicious and I don't even care for crepes, but when we went to pay and saw they charged $1.50 for the water I couldn't believe it. How do you not offer tap and then have the audacity to charge for water? Especially seeing as how you don't inform customers of this while they're ordering. If everything else about this place was great then I might be able to overlook that, but the waiters seemed aloof, taking a while to even greet us let alone bring our water. Just know that if you plan on going here the service isn't great and bring your own drink."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. They have gluten-free crapes. They will crapes however you want. And the atmosphere is extremely relaxing. A person can go there and every night there's something going on. Some nights there is comedy, karaoke, Argentina tango dancing. There is art night. As you can see I like this place very much."}
{"text":"We came for a late breakfast early lunch, the service was slightly slow but the food was delicious and definitely worth the wait. We order the Mexico,Italy,Germany and the Europa all  crepes were delicious great flavor. We will be back for sure ;)"}
{"text":"I love crepes so when me and my friend walked past we couldn't help, but walk in and look over a menu so many choices to pick from its like a trip around the world with crepes. I chose to get the St . Petersburg it was so delicious with caviar. I suggest you should try it at least once."}
{"text":"I love crepes. I will travel miles out of my way for good crepes. I didn't even know this place was here. We were going to go to Echo & Rig for breakfast and found out they were only open for such on the weekend. So, look there on the directory. Crepes!!  We were not disappointed. The ingredients are all very high quality, the menu is creative and extensive, they have gluten free and vegan batters and most importantly the food was amazing. Flavors expertly mingled together in both the savory and the sweet crepes. Also great coffee.  I will absolutely drive miles to come back here again. Best random find all year."}
{"text":"Incredibly kind staff. Sit outside it is beautiful. The coffee is great in a peaceful atmosphere. Walkin distance to the Suncoast. My comment is to cut the potatoes and bacon In crepe friendly way, shaved/sliced? It was harder to eat. Still yummy."}
{"text":"Very unique experience. Agnes, (or Alex, I see different names in the reviews regarding the owner) the owner and chef,  is very much involved in the front of house as well as being the chef. We had the Germany,  Mexico, Europa and the Italian crepes.  All were very good and completely different. The Mexico was the most visually appealing with its vibrant colors.  Although,my husband ordered it with chicken and NO TOMATOES , it was served with beef and lots of tomatoes. He didn't say anything and ate the beef and picked out the tomatoes.  Not sure what was going through Agnes's head while making his crepe, but she seems the type to let you order what you \"think\" you want and ends up giving you what she thinks you should have, she had that kinda personality going on, but she was really into the food and very proud of her menu. You can tell she loves her business and really is involved on every level. The fresh brewed ice tea was delicious, it is $6.50 for a carafe, so it should be good. The atmosphere was really cute and you could totally wear your Valentino messenger here and fit right in. (Which I did)"}
{"text":"i really like the eggs Benedict crepe. it is delicious and beautifully presented. they also have delicious coffee and music at night. tivoli village is a little escape in the city, we will go back."}
{"text":"Tivoli Village struggles to attract anyone so when someone comes in with a $5.00 certificate (that I paid $2.00 for) you sure better honor it and thank them for trying your establishment.  Instead, it was not accepted as they said they had not accepted them since June (hard to believe as I paid for this in September and they have no notice posted regarding their non-acceptance).  The crepes are fairly good but very expensive ($22.75 for two dessert crepes that are not generous in size) so we ordered waters as this was just an afternoon treat.  Then they charged us $3.00 for water even though we didn't ask for bottled waters (I guess that's because they served us two fifteen cent Nestle waters).  I ordered a latte which was good but expensive ($4.80).  Overall, they were able to gain a new customer and then lose that customer almost immediately.  They have a notice saying that they won't be in this location after December 31 but the staff say they don't know where they'll be.  My guess is that they will be out of business, which is sad but probably where they should be based on the way we were treated."}
{"text":"This place is just OK.  The crepes had a good consistency and the toppings were flavourful and fresh.  However, by American standard, the plates are small or the prices are high.  Unfortunately, they only offer bottled water, no tap. :(  But, plus points for being in a kid-friendly location and having a kid-themed space inside."}
{"text":"Nice people, genuinely friendly, organic and local produce, kids area and activities, and nice thin delicious crepes. We had the europa with nutella and berries, and the france with caramel creme."}
{"text":"Fantastic dessert. Will have to come back for breakfast lunch and Dinner. Great ambiance,  music, food and service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Latin jazz Friday nights and jazz Saturday nights. The owners is wonderful very attentive.  I wished  I lived on this side of town to visit more often.  The crepes are the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that the food deserves 5 stars, but the chairs were so uncomfortable that I had to deduct a star, the only thing that was bad about our initial visit here. And I say initial, because I know we'll be going back.  We were celebrating and wanted something different, the reviews and comments about this place sparked our curiosity.  We got to Tivoli, did the valet, and found this bistro to the left of Brio.   We were there early enough that it was happy hour, with half-sized crepes being one of the specials (good wine prices being another). Since we hadn't been there before, we asked the waiter about them and he said they were about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a regular crepe.  Our mistake, not asking how big a regular crepe was.. thinking we knew that answer.  They were more what I would call a full-size crepe, so you can imagine how huge the regular size crepes are!  We got the following:   From the breakfast crepe menu:       France: ham, egg, goat cheese, scallions, parsley, tomatoes, bechamel sauce             (we both loved it)      Alaska: smoked salmon, cream cheese, garnished with pickles, capers &             cucumber slices (we both went apes, unanimously our favorite)   From the lunch/dinner crepe menu:      St. Petersburg: caviar, sour cream, pickled onion, tomato, cornichons, capers             (really good!)      Scandinavia: smoked white fish, sour cream, capers, tarragon sauce             (exactly as described, but rather boring.. probably exactly like you'd get in               Sweden)      Greece: chicken, Bulgarian feta cheese, greens, cucumbers, tomatoes,             peppers, tsatsiki  (very good, like a chicken gyro in a crepe)       And.. the night's special, which I forget what it was but it had chicken,              sauteed mushrooms and onions, peppers, and other yummy stuff (we              both liked this also but we were getting seriously full so most of it came             home with us afterwards)  Then, the delightful chef decided to surprise us with a couple of dessert crepes, which we managed to find room for despite being full.  South Africa: lemon curd, lemon cream - delightful! Monaco: creme brulee.. an OMG, I think I'm in heaven experience.  Every ingredient was carefully selected and meshed perfectly with the others to create a culinary travelogue for our taste buds. I think the only one we completely finished off was the Alaska but we regret nothing.   We had a lovely chat with the Chef/Owner and were also charmed by our server - both of whom made us feel not only welcomed but almost as if we were family."}
{"text":"Great place!! Personally I love the smoked salmon with capers dish :D Also, it's a really cool spot to bring your kid"}
{"text":"Only reason 2 stars is for the nice atmosphere and musical events, but after multiple visits to this establishment, I truly feel this review should be no stars. I have never been treated so absurdly as a customer in an establishment. Ive always been polite and respectful to the people working here, because i work as a server too. I really tried to like this place because it was so close to my house and friends like to perform here, and I've given this place so many tries (and lots of  my $$$) but my last visit completely convinced me it was a waste.   Upon entering and seating myself and my date, we were completely ignored by the staff for almost a FULL 30 minutes as they served the tables around us, completely ignoring our eye contact. I finally got up and asked the owner if we could get a menu, and he said that they're only serving 4 items right now. Very disappointing, but I understand. The business wasnt doing so well. That's fine. But I really didn't want any of the 4 items they had so I decided I should get a drink.   Before deciding, a waitress came to our table, and offered water. Which she was going to charge $3.50 for, and left right in the middle of me speaking and saying \"oh, no thank y-\" so I ran up to her and told her that we didn't want any water to which she scowled and demanded \"why not?\" In such an aggressive tone that I was actually shocked.  I told her we were just leaving, to which, she scoffed at us and rolled her eyes. ( what the fuck, right?) Just before leaving, I was saying a quick hello to someone else I knew that I spotted having dinner in the corner of the restaurant, while I was saying goodbye, the same waitress came over and said \"you guys need to go away now. You got to respect what I'm trying to do here.\" I responded that we were just saying goodbye and she said, and I QUOTE, \"you know this isn't a cafe. Our rules are a little bit different here.\"  I was so angry I didn't even look at her and walked out. No wonder they're going out of business.   Name tag said Agnes. Telling EVERYONE I KNOW not to waste their money here."}
{"text":"Had the New York crepe and the Venetia. Both portions were heart and presentation was beautiful. Unfortunately both sisnt taste good. The filling was bland and tasted a lot like chemical fillers (I'm sure they weren't). Would have like the New York cheese cake to have more cheesy flavor to it but the chef said it 'captures the essence of cheesecake' but 1/3 the calories. They should have labeled it that way on the menu. In any case,  it didn't taste good. The filling was super cold and it made the crepe turn a little hard. I had an Americano coffee and it was bland. Perhaps this is the taste profile they are going after."}
{"text":"Food taste so fresh and preparation is original.  I like the vibe of the restaurant and trust that the chef will always create something delicious, healthy and filling. The live music makes it irresistible."}
{"text":"No menu, not cozy and inviting at all, sloooow service (friendly though), scrambled eggs inside the crepe were UNDERCOOKED (after having waited for 25 minutes for the order, and this was not during a busy time)... Totally overpriced- $10 for a small crepe with no side that's far from the quality of the crepe place at Aria or the other cafe at Tivoli village, both in taste and service... Thumbs down!!!! I highly recommend Leone cafe instead...better food, service, atmosphere etc.."}
{"text":"very nice place with a European flavor.  Big choice of very tasty crepes served in a large portion.  Outdoor seating! Pleasant people to serve you.  Can Vegas appreciate such a great new spot?  Hope so."}
{"text":"Friday night surprise!   Passing by this place on a Friday evening and couldn't help to step in because of the live jazz! Four guys just in their own little world and it made our crepe taste even better.   I've been meaning to stop by here for breakfast or lunch for a long time but for whatever reason never made it. We were pleasantly surprised to see it open in the evening and decided to split a sweet crepe and some beverages...  The crepe was the perfect light dessert as it was made with just some sugar & burnt butter. It was delicious. We also ordered a glass of moscato for me to continue my dessert moment & my man had a few beers. He randomly chose Thai beers and they were great. The service was very pleasant and the Jazz band made the experience extra special.   I already want to go back for breakfast or lunch and try a savory crepe and another sweet one! The atmosphere is very cute with me appreciating the Parisian touches."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best idea ever!  I love their music and food. The music and events are just so much fun!  The crepes are so creative and amazing I have yet to have one that tastes bad and I've been here a few times I try to eat something different each time.  The desert crepes will be the death of me though haha not on flavor but in weight gain.   Alexandra Alexandrof  (spelling?) is just the most delightful owner of this cute establishment.  She is very cheerful and enthusiastic with her customers.  I was surprised to be weighted greeted by her as soon as I walked in.  They are very accommodating and have the most wonderful ambiance.   You must give this place a try, you'll become a regular."}
{"text":"My bf and I walked in here to look at the menu and the owner (I'm only assuming that she is the owner) was so charming and excited about her crepe concept that we had to try it!  The crepes are each inspired by a country or city--we got the Switzerland and the Manhattan-- and both were delicious.   There was a wind ensemble playing while we were there also, which was great.  I am deducting a star because my mimosa was not good and the prices are very steep."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and every time the food and service was great. I love supporting another woman in business and Chef Agnes is awesome. Check out the entertainment in the evenings, too. Not only is place a little gem, she also supports local artists and entertainers. Need a yummy breakfast at 7 am, she's open!"}
{"text":"Wants to appear sophisticated but obviously misses the mark, like that guy wearing a decent suit with white cotton athletic socks and axe body spray.  So it just sort of comes across as needlessly pretentious.   I went with a friend and the owner came by, introduced herself with a very limp handshake and regaled us with the specials, both of which sounded good.  I'm pretty sure she only stopped by because I was laughing at the Moroccan crepe on the menu.  The description said it had a \"chicken and tajine stew.\"  A Tajine is an earthenware cooking vessel in which you prepare stew, so to have it \"and\" means you'll be eating a cooking vessel (there's a few other items on the menu that make it clear they really have no idea what they're talking about).  When the waitress came by to take our order my friend chose the Chicken Provencal special and I chose the Pastrami special.  Neither of which the waitress was at all familiar with.  Luckily for her the Chef was right behind us.  Then the chef outright stated she had no idea what we were talking about.  Lovely.  The waitress goes on to helpfully state that the owner liked to come up with stuff on the spot.  Which is great if she's in the kitchen making it but not when she does it while glad-handing customers with no intention of conveying her ideas to her staff.   We asked a few more questions of the chef to see what she thought was what and my friend decided to play it safe and order off the regular menu, I stuck with the Pastrami special.  When the crepes arrived, fairly quickly, my friend's plate was overflowing with food while mine was very demurely folded into what looked like an empty crepe with some sparse decoration.   The pastrami was tasty but there wasn't much there, especially for $12 dollars. My friend said the Hawaiian wasn't bad but wasn't all that special.   Her crepe cost $14.  I wasn't that hungry that I needed a giant pile of food, but it makes them look bad that their portion sizes were so completely inconsistent, especially for the same table.   Overall, if they hadn't been trying so hard to appear more than they were and just tried to be a consistent, decent crepe place, I'm pretty sure they'd warrant a return visit.   As it is, I'll spend my money someplace else."}
{"text":"Another Great Meal  I Love Everything About This Place! Love The Owner/Chef She is Amazing!"}
{"text":"Crepes + Happy Hour + live music and in-store events!  This little spot has a lot going on. Offering sweet, savory, and even seafood crepes, all are named after a city or country, based on the ingredients. They also offer an \"around the world\" 8-course option ($45/pp, by reservation only) that sounds cool.  HH offers discounted mini-crepes at $5-7 each with a drink purchase (they have beer, wine, and some sparkling water cocktails). I started with the refreshing Peach Ambrosia (a sparkling drink with fruit, apricot and orange flavors also available). The Greek crepe (chicken, feta, peppers, with a yogurt-dill sauce) was solid, as was their featured daily special (chicken, spinach, mushroom, caramelized onion, brie). I would come back to try more.   NOTE: They offer vegan and GF batter options for an additional fee (~$2?)."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are great. We usually eat here about twice a week now. Is there a downside??? Well, my waist size is getting up there.  Their desert crepes are out of this world. The cheesecake crepe has a nice creamy consistency which I love. It's not to thick and pasty like most cheesecakes and cheesecake fillings. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There's plenty other places that deserve your business. 100% Rude and overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"I'm surprised but not surprised that this place closed down.. I never left a review for this place, but was reminded about \"that one crepe place with the rude staff\". I looked them up only to find out they're closed now anyway. So... I never actually got to try the crepes. I came in one day and asked how I would go about ordering a crepe to go. I felt like I asked very politely as I had never been there before. The owner basically shoo'd me away. Made me feel crazy for even asking and said something about it ruining the idea of a crepe.. I still don't really understand what point she was trying to make, but a simple no would have been better than her rude attitude. I literally just walked away and was thinking to myself \"alrighty then, guess I won't be going there ever again..\" they lost a customer that day for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing manager and food! I love this place so much! They are so kind to you and really make you feel at home. They interact with you. Amazing people and great place!! I love it."}
{"text":"Located in Tivoli village, it's a great location to sit outside and just enjoy the day. My husband and I went on Saturday in the morning. I was super excited to try the crepes.   After waiting what seemed like a lifetime we were finally able to order.  We decided to get non-desert ones, I got the Milano (\"Caprese\" - fresh mozzarella, tomato basil and balsamic reduction) and my husband got Britain (bacon, eggs, potatoes topped with gravy sauce).   Mine was pretty good. I mean you can't really mess up something that simple. My husband on the other hand, did not like this. They didn't have bacon so they gave him Canadian bacon (so it was more like ham). He wasn't a fan of it.   I had also ordered a latte but never got it. Now I could of understood if they were super busy, but they weren't and it doesn't take long to make a latte. When it came time to pay, our waiter had charged us for my latte that I never got. If it wasn't because I asked if the latte was included, I would of ended up paying for something I never got. She didn't even realize I never got it...SMH."}
{"text":"Located in the Tivoli Village shoppes. I love crepes! So hard to find. Creme brúlée crepe (#39, Monaco) was light and airy with a wonderful texture. Never had a better one in the states. Crepes were light and airy, just like my Eastern European mom used to make. The decor is gorgeous, with a rustic flair from its old school deli counter to the iron staircase leading to upstairs shops. Service was fast and friendly. Pricing is upper mid-range, but well worth it. These people have some mad gourmet skills in the kitchen. Outside sidewalk seating is available. We're coming back for breakfast the next three days :)"}
{"text":"Chef Agnes is a micromanager and made ordering a truly unnecessary pain in the ass!   I hadn't heard anything good about this place but when my 10 year old cousin asked for a smoothie I couldn't say no.. after all, how hard could it be to order a smoothie to-go? Annoyingly difficult apparently!  We walked in with my corgi in tow knowing The Market is pet friendly, plus we were just walking up to the register to order and wait for it outside. I asked the man at the register if we could order a smoothie to-go and he explained it would be about 5-10 mins. Okay, no problem. Just as I was about to hand over my card Chef Agnes got in my face saying, \"there's a table outside, have a seat. we can't allow dogs in here. food will take about 25 mins.\"   1. Get out of my face 2. We're not staying for a sit down meal 3. There are a couple dogs in here right now  I told her we were just ordering a smoothie to-go and she said, \"yes, still 25 mins\". HA! who the hell is going to wait that long for a smoothie?! plus, your cashier told me 5-10.  We walked out, I sat my cousin on a bench with my corgi and went back in to order. Mind you, now I'm in the back of the line again. I get to the register, order the smoothie and the guy looks at me like, \"didn't you order?\". Helloooooooo! Where have you been?! I was going to pay you until the crazy lady got all up in my face. I was going to excuse his obvious lack of knowledge with the register during our first exchange but now it's clear you all have no idea what you're doing. One berry smoothie, to go.. that's it! he asks, \"what size?\" and before he can get back with the cups to show me the two sizes they have, here comes Chef Agnes again asking him if he's knows someone's at the register. DUH LADY! let him do his job! someone has control issues.  terrible."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden secrets on the Westside.  The Crepe is an amazing place run by a great, friendly, and personable staff.  It's always a joy to see a chef take time to spend with their diners.  Each time we visit we have a wonderful experience.  Best crepes of my life--EVERY time I come back they get better and better. The Crepe is the best part of Tivoli Village. Amazing chef, great service, and a brilliant understanding of the artistic side of gastronomy.  I appreciate that they have options for children on the menu too.  These options are not low-scale fast-food quality options.  They adhere to the same high standard in which the rest of the menu is held.  They also offer live music, art night, tea time, and other cultural activities.  This is so much more than just a restaurant, its a journey through food cultures! Many thanks for the beautiful meals."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this restaurant. My boyfriend and I came here to experience the ambiance and the food this place has to offer. I ordered the Macedonia crepe and my boyfriend ordered the Poland crepe. The Macedonia crepe has egg, feta, and spinach. None of the ingredients were evenly distributed and it lacked in flavor. My boyfriends order looked delectable, it had cabbage and \"polish sausage\". Disappointed to find out that the sausage was just a hot dog and the cabbage was poorly undercooked. We didn't even finish our meals and trust me we never waste a bite. We gave the restaurants the benefit of the doubt and ordered the traditional desert crepe with bananas and Nutella. The batter of the crepe was super tough and the Nutella was not even warm. No free refills on coffee either. This place was super expensive too. We will not be returning to this restaurant. We have been to every restaurant in Tivioli village, it's a bummer that this couldn't have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Amazing...I had the Argentina and my girlfriend had the Britain, both of them made me want to come back."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time this past week with a meet-up group of about 10 people. To be honest, I was really put off and embarrassed when the waitress informed some of the people at our table that they did not serve ice water and they'd need to go fill a cup with tap water in the back if they wanted water. Seriously, this is the first time I have ever gone to a restaurant in my entire life where they did not serve ice water. So how exactly is the ice tea made? Just curious...  The waitress actually gave the guests a cup and told them to go fill their own tap water from the back of the restaurant. I wish this were a joke and if we were not waiting on a big group of people to show up, we would have left. I truly don't understand why this even had to be an issue. Of course some people at the table were upset when the waitress acted like this was normal and seemed surprised by the reactions she got.  Just..wow. We have zero plans of ever going back."}
{"text":"The other review is nonsense. The ambiance is a big empty room with stone floors. There is no decor at all. Nithing on the walls, no signs, no menus even. I went twice and both times did not get any food.   Today, I tried again and watched them serve people who arrived after me and ordered after me by a good 5 minutes. I can be patient and know that good food takes time, but no customers are more important than others.   Bad service."}
{"text":"This place was great. Small, great music and the food was wonderful! Easy to tell they use fresh ingredients. Wait time for food was a little long but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"So excited that I run into a great new place with great ambience and super friendly staff ... THE CREPE AT TIVOLI VILAGE I had dinner at The Crepe and tried both the savory and sweet crepes and they were delicious. The place is clean and the staff made the experience great. The place on the first floor of the The Market LV, next to Brio."}
{"text":"Mom and I happily entered an elegant yet simple corner of France called The Crepe. Ordered the Hungary crepe, a perfectly cooked treasure with peach jam, honey and powdered sugar. Every last bite was delicious. Friendly service topped it off. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"my kids and I loved this place, \"the italian\" had delicious prosciutto in it and my kids had the nutella one. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Haven't even eaten here yet and already I've had a bad experience.   Decor: not much...it's almost like it's trying to be something in Seattle's Pike Place Market.   Service: When it's slow like the first night I was there, the chef talked to us and informed us vegan options would be available during the weekend. The place didn't have menus...customers have taken them... I return on the weekend for the market and stop by again. While waiting, a lady lines up behind me and the chef by passes me to take the lady's order behind me!  While witnessing this, another lady in front of me asks for protein options, the chef then tells her \"you name it we got it!\" Not even a question like \"what kind of protein are you looking for?\" Finally I get up to order and she then tells me \"Monday I'll have the order/supplies in to make vegan crepes\" okay I'll wait till Monday. I call before I go over, and she's not even sure if she has vegan items to make a crepe...\"Tuesday my supplier will be here with the vegan batches\"...so you don't make the batches yourself, yet charge a ridiculous price? C'mon!   This place will never see my business. Seems like a great idea, probably jumped in a bit early.   Tip to the owner: Make a permanent menu and have more knowledge on your inventory."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. The owners are wonderful people and even came out to see how we enjoyed the food. Everything is handmade and the wait was surprisingly short. Wonderful place in the new shopping center. I'll be coming here a lot."}
{"text":"The service is exceptional. The environment is very cozy and they have so many events going on all the time. The food is first class and best of all it's so affordable. It's like walking in to a classy place and experiencing high end service. I have taken my family and friends here and everyone is so amazed at the experience they have the moment they walk in the door. A great place to visit regularly and  great place to call a unique Las Vegas experience."}
{"text":"So in love with this place. We just got back from Europe and hunting for the perfect crepes. This is it! So many to choose from try the Manhatten...There's one for each place in and out of the country..."}
{"text":"If you like crepes for breakfast, you ought to try them for lunch and dinner.  The Crepe is definitely the place to go!  My favorite for breakfast is Austria ( strudel-style with cinnamon- caramelized apple or pumpkin). Their crepe selections are named after countries all over the world including one from The Philippines for lunch and dinner with pulled pork and vegetables in sauce.  My favorite for lunch or dinner is Provence ( filled with chicken, mushroom, goat cheese and spinach). The proprietor is from Bulgaria - friendly, hospitable and so gracious! She remembers everyone who dines at her establishment - impressive!  My second trip there we sat down and had a very long conversation about the various types of crepe cuisine in Asia including the fresh \"Lumpia\"  from the Philippines which is also a crepe dish.  Check online for various events for kids and adults including music from other parts of the world.  It's located in the heart of shopping and other restaurants with unique dining concepts at Tivoli Village."}
{"text":"Incredible service, food, live classical music and ambiance. Favorite place in all of Vegas to have breakfast."}
{"text":"A wonderful little gem. Stopped in for an open mic night and ended up trying the Alaska and the Canada. They were both delicious and the portions are generous.   The place is run by a small crew but they see very dedicated to the quality of their entrees.  One of the high points was the fact that they add a little fresh fruit or salad to each entree they serve, so you get a great looking plate and a nice additional flavor.  I'll definitely be back to sample more from their fun, country themed menu!"}
{"text":"Traditional crepes. Clean area. Special family kid friendly area. Crepe kids menu. Authentic food and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dessert on the 4th of July after having dinner at another restaurant in Tivoli Village. The crepes were divine. I had the South Africa crepe which comes with lemon curd and creme. It was light and delicious and just enough after a heavy meal. My husband really enjoyed his Maui crepe with guava cream and pineapple. My mom also loved her Europa (nutella, fruit). They have Lavazza coffee and my cappuccino and her macchiato were prepared quickly. The server was very pleasant and even though they were out of the tea my husband wanted, they were very quick to apologise and suggest a very good alternative. I will definitely return so I can try all of the other very appetizing choices on their menu!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. The coffee was good. The staff was decent. It's nice that they had a play area for kids. However, my husbands and my food came out first and we had to wait an additional 20 min to get our children's food. By that time ours was completely cold. We also ordered a sweet crepe but the cream was completely broken and separated. We had such high hopes but needless to say we were completely disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the ambience was totally ruined by each point of service. I asked about happy hour and they said since it was a national holiday (Black Friday wtf?) they weren't doing it. When I ordered my wine the waitress forgot to send it in, since she was not 21 she could not serve me. I asked for tap water they said I had to get it as bottled water. I just felt like having high expectations for a nice lunch was misconstrued that this would be a normal dining experience. Didn't want to order dessert because I didn't want to spend any more money for low quality."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" sums it up nicely.  Located on the ground floor of the Tivoli Village 'Market', I had high hopes that The Crêpe would not disappoint and make the near 30 minute journey worthwhile.  Of course, this was not the case.    Start to finish, this place is (and I'm being generous) two stars.  Upon entering, there's a sign that states \"please seat yourself\".  Fail number one; combining the seat yourself concept with inept servers leads to a guest sitting at their table for 20 minutes before being greeted.  One would think that the 20 minute wait would yield at least a glass of water; not so fast!  This restaurant does not have the ability to serve ice water...only their bottles of water.  What?!?!  I've been served a glass of water in a third world country, this is fucking Summerlin NV USA!  OK I'll play ball, \"I'll take an iced vanilla latte please\" I reply; not so fast again!  Are you kidding me!?! Guess what, they also don't have glasses to serve an iced vanilla latte in, only their Styrofoam to-go cups.  What finally arrived was a room temperature latte with no ice; I suppose the lack of a sink also precludes them from the ability to make ice.  Want plain ol' coffee?  Too bad, they don't have coffee, just fancy espresso-based drinks.  On to the food!  This is going to be amazing I think to myself; given the bold statement that this is THE CREPE, as stated right on the front door!  Two crepes were chosen: the Bologna and the France.  The France, which includes ham, eggs, farm(?) cheese, scallions, parsley, tomatoes and béchamel sauce was standard fare; it doesn't disappoint, but it also didn't wow me.  There was no discernible difference in flavor with the ingredients here, just a crepe stuffed with the above and the usual béchamel sauce.  The Bologna, which includes meat, red sauce and Italian cheese would have been OK if I knew that it wasn't going to be a crepe.  Let's explore this further:  the name of the business is The Crêpe and the Bologna is listed under their savory crepe section; it should be safe to assume that one would be receiving a crepe.  Well, not exactly; the Bologna is merely the cooked crepe batter with the meat and sauce slopped on top; more like lasagne than a crepe.  The service here was shitty; harsh but true.  No check back for another drink...maybe I'd like another room temperature latte. No check back after the meal was dropped...maybe there was a roach in my food (there wasn't), they wouldn't have known it however because they never came back to see how things were going.  Confidence in its purest form?  \"Our food is so great we don't need to bother ourselves with your opinion.\"  Nearly 30 minutes pass by after the crepes were finished. Se il vous plaît, le chèque! Yah, I had to get up and go to the counter and request it, where I was met by a fairly combative owner who dismissed the few concerns that I brought to her attention.  I've lost count on how many times this place has failed.  Needless to say I won't waste my time driving up here again."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Breakfast. Long wait, could not understand no gloves, no hand washing, no hat in the kitchen. When we paid the girl stopped prepping, took cash and went back to prepping without washing hands. Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"The server was really sweet and helpful. My crepe was ok though. I ordered the Japan crepe and it was pretty salty. I think it was from the miso sauce that was on it. But girl and chef overheard me talking to my friend and offered to make it less salty next time I stop by, which was really sweet in my opinion.   Overall good service and kind staff, but food was average."}
{"text":"We love the food at the Crepe and the service is as great as the food! Thank you for bringing such amazing food & desserts to Tivoli"}
{"text":"I'm not necessarily a crepe fanatic, but I do love a good one and being that Tivoli Village isn't that far from home, I've had The Crepe bookmarked since they opened. It's not hard to see the appeal of this place, especially when it comes to the atmosphere. You've got a nice little French inspired restaurant and for those with kids, they have this really cool little play area! The lighting is neat, the live music is a nice touch and it just has a cool ambience. I wasn't a fan of the tiny tables and uncomfortable seats though.  One of the biggest issues I have with this place was the service. They have a sign up front that says whether to seat yourself or wait to be seated. For whatever reason, the sign was pushed into a corner and since apparently customers don't get greeted at the door here, we kinda just stood there until I went over and asked someone if we could just seat ourselves. After we found a table, it took a good 10 minutes for a waitress to come over and take our drink order...but the drinks did came out fast and I love how they serve the iced tea in a carafe. So, we looked at the menus and after putting them away, ended up waiting another 15 minutes for a completely different waitress to come over and take our food order. The original girl who took our drink order had this complete look of disgust on her face and seemed to be pretty unhappy, so I'm actually glad it was a different girl. But apart from that, they rarely check on you during your meal and neither the restaurant or bathrooms were very clean. The same seemingly angry employee was resetting tables that hadn't been washed or had trash on the floors and chairs underneath it. They just seem way too unorganized here.  Moving on to the menu, they've got quite a few crepe selections including items for breakfast, lunch and dessert. One cool thing they offer is the \"Crepe Duo\" which gives you your choice of 1 savory crepe and 1 dessert crepe. For the prices though, I thought the portions were a bit small. Most people would probably easily be able to finish the Crepe Duo and at $23, it's a bit hard on the wallet. When you factor in a drink and tip, one person could ended up spending over $30 to eat here. For crepes? Eh, I don't know.  The crepes themselves were hit and miss for me. We ended up ordering 3 crepes to split between us...the Britain (bacons, eggs, potatoes, gravy), the Argentina (beef, peppers, onions, chimichurri) and the Austria (strudel, caramelized apple). The Britain was the smallest of the 3 with mostly eggs filling it and severely lacking in salt. With the Argentina, it had a bit more filling and the flavor was much better. While still a bit lacking in salt, and pepper too, the beef was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri sauce has nice, bold flavors with just the right hint of garlic. Sadly, the Austria was the worst of the 3 and just a complete let down. I'm not even sure how they managed to do so, but there was almost no flavor in the whole thing. You can taste the apples on their own but everything else was completely bland.  In my opinion, it's just okay and although the service was lacking, the ambience, iced tea carafes and the decent Argentina crepe is what pushed me to 3 stars. I won't be rushing back, but I'd give them another shot if it was in the mood for a crepe and didn't want to drive across town."}
{"text":"Passed by here after dinner and saw that there's daily events here, both during the day and night. Decide to stay here for their live jazz that happens on Saturday nights.   Jazz was not too bad. I suspect most of the patrons here are really here for the performance by this relatively young jazz band. Most patrons, like me, only ordered a beverage.   Service was friendly. I really appreciate the warm hospitality the staff was giving. My only complaint is I wished there were wine or some sort of alcoholic beverage that we can order, other than coffee or smoothie. I mean, c'mon, jazz without some vino?"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Tivoli Village one Saturday morning for a farmers market. We had never been before as summerlin is a bit of a drive but I'm so glad we did! Tivoli village is beautiful, total Tuscany vibe.  Anyway, after we checked the farmers market we were hungry and saw this crepe place. I, somehow, made it 23 years into life without ever having a crepe. Obviously this needed to be fixed.  The inside is so adorable, there was live music, the staff was extremely hospitable. Their crepe selection is huge and they're named after different places around the world and their crepes embody those flavors.  I ordered a crepe on special that was herbed chicken, spinach, mushrooms, goat cheese, and parsley with a little side salad. The crepe was AMAZING! I'm on a goat cheese kick and it went perfectly with the chicken. The chicken was so moist and I don't know what herbed and spices they used but my fiancé said they tasted very much like Paris. I also ordered a glass of champagne (they have a very large selection of beer and wine, even sake!) The live music was nice for atmosphere, and they kept the doors open but it didn't get hot at all inside. It was actually almost chilly. My fiancé ordered a crepe with flan in it, which was positively divine. I ate a few bites and learned that flan and champagne really go together! Too sweet for me to eat the whole thing, I'll stick to my savory crepes.  There's also a stairwell to go to the cute little boutique shops upstairs, definitely check them out! Has a very exposed industrial vibe not to mention a wine bar with a great view."}
{"text":"Having worked out the bugs of opening this place last year, the Crepe hosts a truly organic music and dance scene, with great French fusion food in an authentic European environment.  Now with beer and wine, they are only getting better and better.  Agnes and Alex are gems and the crowd is like the United Nations.  Jazz nights, Tango nights, it's always something different and the hosts are always friendly and interacting.  Casual in the day, can get dressy on nights when guests tend to dance."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. Coffee is very good. It's all espresso, not filter, or brewed. No refills, just awesome coffee drinks. Roomie atmosphere, sunny, friendly, conversational noise level and ambience."}
{"text":"Every time the fiancé and I come here, we leave happy. The crepes are pretty good. We've tried the Argentinian and Spanish crepe for a savory style. We have also tried the Belgian, Europa, Venezia and Austrian crepes for dessert. I liked them all to be honest. I also love that there's live music all the time as well.  Some people on here have complained about the service, which yes, sometimes can be a bit off, but the servers are NEVER rude. I think sometimes they just get slammed, and if they make a mistake, they will fix it or make up for it. The owner is sweet and makes very good suggestions. She takes pride in her business, which is respectable.  I, honestly,am tired of seeing these reviews by people who think they're actual restaurant critics. Give me a break and GET A LIFE. Some people have one bad experience and think they can pass judgment based on that. Really. Get over yourselves.   Ok, rant over. Gonna get myself a crepe now."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for Sunday morning breakfast.  There was live music as we entered but we immediately noticed there was only seating available toward the front.  For us the table right in the middle by the door was too cold.  It's unfortunate they cannot close the doors because it would make for a much more pleasant dining experience in the colder months.  A table closer to the wall and away from the doorway opened and we took it and that made it more comfortable.  We also had a two year with us so the kids play area was appreciated.  He occupied himself there almost the entire time and it was very visible from where we were sitting.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I enjoyed it.  The crepe version is much lighter than the traditional biscuit version and comes with a side of fruit.   For dessert we ordered the pumpkin strudel to share.  This dish wasn't sweet as we expected it to be.  The 2-year old in our group was not impressed at all and actually spit it out.  Poor kid.  The owner did explain to us that it wasn't meant to be sweet but since we were ordering this as a dessert I wish we had known that ahead of time.  She did try to make it better by doctoring it up with cinnamon, powdered sugar and honey.    Overall, I did enjoy the food and the atmosphere and it's a great spot for breakfast but I think I will wait to come back when the weather warms up a bit."}
{"text":"Such a fun restaurant! The staff are so awesome, the food is great, and I always leave here with a smile on my face. Can't say enough nice things about it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Had no idea what I had wondered into as I was just trying to pass time before an appointment that I had upstairs. Everyone was friendly, it didn't take that long to be served, there was a live band, and my crepe,The Greece, was phenomenal. The owner was delightful to chat with and I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account so I could write this review. I love this local gem. They are serious about their food. The Bulgaria Crepe, which I had today, features relish sourced directly from Eastern Europe. The food's organic - I love the peace of mind of knowing my eggs aren't generic label eggs sourced from Walgreens.   The energy and atmosphere is unlike anywhere else I've found living in this city. The owner and staff are awesome people. Eat here. Work here."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday and WOW what amazing crepes!!  Shared an Italy and an Austria and the quality was simply outstanding!  Service was great as well.  The only negative is the fact that they don't do tap water and charge 1.50 for bottled water.  It seems to me that if they were really sorry about that they would charge something closer to cost for people dining there."}
{"text":"Crepes are okay (only reason this is a 2 star instead of a 1 star). Seem to use health-conscious ingredients. Definitely over-priced.   Owner is rude- talked badly to me about other customers. I really didn't want to hear her negative comments about people whether I knew them or not    She also claimed that she CAN'T have drinking water- something about the design of the restaurant? I thought it was illegal to not have water available in a restaurant?!? Or was she just lying to me? I mean, they have to have something to wash their dishes with, right? And how hard is it to hook up a drinking tap? But she claims this is not a restaurant- it's a social club or something. Bull crap! I've seen several other restaurants (and this IS a restaurant- I wonder what her business license is under) with smaller kitchens than hers, and they all have had tap water available for their patrons. So A) try going to a different crepe shop- there are definitely better ones , or B) since the crepes are okay, and Tivoli Village is fun to check out, if you absolutely HAVE to eat crepes while you're there (there are other better restaurants there, too), bring your own water and try to avoid the negative comments"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.  The owner was very gracious and helpful.  The entree crepes are large so you want to be hungry or share.  Desert crepes are very tasty. especially the canolli crepe. This place reminded us of our vacation to southern France.  The live music is always a bonus!!! We definitely have to return soon."}
{"text":"We are such fans. It's the perfect light dinner with a glass of wine and a taste from around the world in a crepe! The favors are delightful. Tonight me crepe is Greece and the wine is from Bulgaria. He is having the crepe from France with wine from Italy. Service is attentive and warm. Why don't we come her even more often?! Love it."}
{"text":"I am not a crepe person unless it is for a dessert but this place made me a fan! I ordered the USA breakfast crepe and it was so delicious. I had 6 kids with me and they all ordered something different and they loved it. The owner was so sweet and gave us a complimentary crepe for a birthday girl! First time here but will be back very soon!!! Definitely want to try a few things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly service. The coffee was good, which so far has been pretty hit or miss in Vegas.  The crepes were fantastic. We had the Alaskan (salmon, cream cheese, capers, onions), the Florida (key lime) and the Provence (eggs, mushrooms, Brie, herbes de Provence).  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"So today we we strayed a bit from our typical Saturday trip to Tivoli Village for the Farmers Market and Breakfast at the Amazing Cafe Leone and decided to duck out of the sun and to checkout The Crepe.   We had walked by it numerous times in the past but could never quite figure what it actually was a restaurant, Desert and Coffee shop or music venue? But the in-laws were in town and my Nephew loves Crepes so we decided to check it out.   While my brother in law ordered a Crepe and a couple drinks at the counter we Sat-down in the Cafe style setup and waited for the food.   A cordial waitress put some silverware on the table and a small plate of sliced fruit and asked if we would like drinks or anything else which we declined. Then it got a bit bizarre. While my nephew ate his Crepe a Crepe chef approached us to ask if we ordered food and then a manager approached 10 minutes later telling us they had a reservation in 15 minutes and needed the table. So after sitting for a max of fifteen min from the time we walked in the door ( at a Coffee and Dessert Cafe) we were basically asked to leave surrounded by a series of empty table tops. And the kids were good as gold so there were not any extenuating circumstances there. So we left for a walk through the Boutique shops without ordering a couple Coffees for the walk or leaving a nice tip for the server which is our custom in this setting.  While I still have no clue what it is the Crepe is trying to be or was trying to accomplish in it's approach towards us. I do know it's an establishment we will not be frequenting again. And truly hope that the reason for their approach had everything to do with having a bad day and nothing to do with discrimination."}
{"text":"never heard of this place but a friend invited me out to listen to some music.  I was disappointed they didn't have a liquor license but that was only one of my disappointments.  we ordered a fruit plate and a crispy crepe.  it's the dead of summer and the fruit plate had fall and winter fruits, and half of the grapes were near rotten. the crispy crepe was decent but at $8 it was impossible to enjoy.  I also asked for a glass of water and was charged $1.  I almost ordered dessert but the server never came around to take my order, which is probably for the best because all of the dessert crepes were priced at $10.50 to start."}
{"text":"A savory crêpe for breakfast?  It sounded like a good idea and it was.  While waiting at an office yesterday morning, I did a Yelp search and found The Crêpe was on the way home.  After the appointment, off I was to Tivoli Place for breakfast.  There was a sign to seat yourself and I went a few tables in from the open door.  It was a perfect place because you could enjoy the morning air but the breeze coming in wasn't overwhelming.  I was brought a menu by Agnes.  I later found out she was the owner.  After looking over the selection of breakfast crêpes, I went with the special of the day which was a crêpe with pastrami, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and Russian mustard.  The crêpe was very tasty.  The mustard absolutely made the dish, however.  It was a rich, spicy, brown mustard with a lot of favor.  As I was waiting for the crêpe to be made, Agnes came by and as we starting chatting, she sat down across the table from me and she explained that the restaurant had only been opened for two months.  We also talked about the music and dance evenings they have.  I think I need to go back for one of the jazz nights and have a dessert crêpe.  The crêpe was tasty and it was artfully presented.  As I said before, the mustard made the dish!  I will come back again.  I like the space and the ambiance.  The crêpes are a bit pricey, but then the rents for Tivoli have to be high, too!  A coffee Americano is $3 with a $1.50 charge for a refill.  I guess that's because it's individually brewed Lavazza but it's quite different when I'm used to a bottomless cup at breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love the sweet crepes. I took my mom there, who is allergic to everything. The chef is wonderful, she made a special crepe for her."}
{"text":"The Monaco-creme brûlée crepe was awesome... I will definitely come back for that!  I ordered Germany Crepe, which disappointed me because it was just plain crepe with sausage ,sauerkraut and pickles, tasted like plain old hotdog in a bun with lots of sauerkraut.   My husband ordered Greece, which I think is better than what I ordered. But it doesn't taste as interesting as it sounds in the menu.   The ambiance was great, has a market-y vibe . And the concept of having to taste different kinds of specialty from Different countries in the world was an excellent idea.  The savoury crepes for lunch / dinner  were not really as awesome as I expected from the menu. However,  I would like to try the crepes from the breakfast menu. I'm thinking I will try Manhattan crepe next time.."}
{"text":"Update:  After my first experience here, I was sitting on the fence. I loved the food and the restaurant decor. The effort you can see has gone into this business. But maybe it was the service I was unsure about.   This time around I have to say i was quite impressed. As always the food is amazing, and well worth the trip. Service was ten fold better than the first time I was here.  I agree with another Yelper Sarah Jane, that even though Crepe is awesome, I think downtown would be the perfect fit for this business. So right now I'll suffer with it being so close to my house.  Extremely kid friendly, if you have little ones this is the perfect place for a bite to eat and a play area to keep the little ones occupied.  Also make sure to ask about there stamp cards!!! And also they are the first place in Las Vegas to use Bitcoin."}
{"text":"I am really digging The Crepe!  Have you been yet?  Well, why not???  I noticed The Crepe the other day when I was in the mall.  I couldn't go then, but knew I had to give it a shot soon.  What really caught my eye was all of the things that The Crepe is involved in and promoting.  Who doesn't love a fun neighborhood joint that has Argentine Tango night, Live Jazz night, and even Story Time for the kids.  Yay for trying to get a community going!    I noticed they have a great Mommy/Daddy & Me deal going on Monday-Friday 10-11am.  The deal is for every full sized crepe purchased, you get a free kid's sized crepe for your kiddo.  I love a good deal, especially a BOGO deal.  So I had to go and check this place out.  On our visit, we got there at 10am and were the only ones there, except for our friends we were meeting.  We were greeted right away by our server and he took good care of us the entire time.  He wasn't familiar with the BOGO deal, but we go that straightened out pretty quickly.   We had good service the entire meal and felt truly appreciated the whole time.  Our server even told us about all of the other fun stuff they do for kids there like the story time and puppet shows they do throughout the week.  He did a great job.  I wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out.  Now to the good stuff, the crepes!  There are so many options to choose from!  Everyone in any group is bound to find at least 1, if not a dozen they want to try.  On this visit I tried the breakfast France crepe.  It had eggs, ham, farm cheese, tomatoes, and béchamel sauce.  It was super duper yummy!  My daughter had the sweet USA crepe.  Her crepe was filled with pb&j with some sliced bananas thrown in the mix.  She hardly eats anything at all and she took down half of this in a few minutes.  That is crazy impressive for her!  There were about 15 other ones that caught my eye as well, so I see us going back often, especially for the BOGO deal!  I was also very impressed with the quality of the ingredients that are being used at The Crepe.  They try to use as much locally sourced items as possible for their menu.  The freshness of the food really comes through in the flavors you find in the crepes.   I love fresh food and helping to support our local farmers, as well as just having better quality food!  Speaking of going often, The Crepe offers as frequent visitor punch card.  I love punch cards and wish more places did this for their regulars.  The Crepe does it so every 9th crepe is free.  Not too shabby, if I do say so.   They also have a little play area for kids.  This is a fabulous idea because when you have toddlers, they just really aren't into eating.  I know my daughter usually takes 2 bites and is ready to go play.  With the kid's area being right by some tables, all of us adults can sit and enjoy our crepes and watch our kids play.  This way everyone is happy!  Thanks for thinking of us parents who really want to eat something beside drive thru all of the time when we are with our munchkins.  The only critique I would have for The Crepe is the drink selection.  I am a weirdo who doesn't like coffee, hot tea, or smoothies.  If you could add some regular soda to the menu, that would be great.  I almost always have a soda when I am out and about. I love soda just a smidgeon less than my kid, so help a girl out please! Even if it is just canned soda, I think it would be a great thing to offer your patrons. Please please please add some soda and I will be back even more often, PROMISE!"}
{"text":"Looked for a place to eat in Tivoli Village (a cute place to shop by the way) and we came across Crêpe Bistro.   You sit yourself upon arrival!  Their menu *44 choices of crepes! *happy hour 2:30-6:30 *The Crêpe Duo $24.80 is a neat combo combining an entree and a dessert (we got this one). It doesn't really save you money, but it just does the math for you.   The aesthetics are on point for their place! I absolutely love it.   The food:  The Philippines (Pulled pork entree Crêpe) is amazing! Meat loving action right here!!!  The Alaska (Salmon, breakfast choice Crêpe) skinny but packed full of cream cheese (too much for my taste). I wouldn't order this again, but others may like it!  Overall, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Henderson to Tivoli Village for a nice relaxed dessert place after reading some of the reviews. The two crepes we tried were absolutely amazing, the service was awesome-very personable. I would say this isn't a place if you're in a rush because it has a very laid back vibe and the staff welcomes you to stay and relax rather than rush you out of there, which is exactly what we were looking for tonight. We will be returning customers for sure to try different crepes since they have such a diverse selection and most of them are rather unique. It has a \"crepes from around the world\" vibe so as to satisfy anyone's craving."}
{"text":"The two stars are for atmosphere and great service.   I have had Crepes in French Territories, Japan, and California. My expectations led to a disappointment. The only crepes that were more disappointing were the ones I tried to make, and had to eat my mistakes.  I do have to say, the interior is very nice, and since it was Saturday night, they had live music. The server and manager were very good, and always there anticipating your needs.  If Tivoli is over crowded, and they are available for lunch, I would say, okay.  If you're trying to impress someone with your knowledge of French Cuisine, I would actually reccomend you treat them to crepes at the specialty shop at the Belliago."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  I despise fake-ass Tivoli Village and its Botox Betty clientele, but this is a humble little jewel of authenticity in a sea of bourgeois poseury. The Crepe is the only locally-owned restaurant in the complex, basically a start-up run by a young couple, and the place has a definite Euro vibe that might alienate some Ricky Bobby types.     A friend *INSISTED* I try this place, so I hitched up my wagons and forded the Summerlin Pkwy, journeying out to the wilds of upscale suburbia to see what all the fuss was. And I was glad I did!  Come to find out, a crepe is basically just a (tastier) tortilla, and can be stuffed with pretty much anything -- sweet or savory -- to make what amounts to a burrito. This place names each dish after a different country, so you can order crepes stuffed with Indian, Thai, Polish, Moroccan, Argentine, Bulgarian, Russian...almost ANY type of cuisine in the world! And that's just the savory ones -- they also have a shit ton of dessert crepes stuffed with fruit, chocolate, nuts, etc.   I had the Greek (fabulous!!!) followed by the Europa (Nutella and fruit). I also had a few bites of my friend's Sofia (nuts and honey). REALLY good! I definitely plan to come back and try them all (except maybe the Scandinavian....ya know?!?!)  I see from the other reviews on here that a chief complaint is service. They only have a little tiny kitchen -- right in the open behind the counter -- so if the place is packed, I can see it taking some time to get your order. But guess what?!? It's a little startup, with a little kitchen and a little staff. This ain't Brio!! Cut 'em some slack!!!  Instead of getting your panties all twisted, chill the fuck out and enjoy the scene -- they have some form of live music or entertainment every night, from this smoking hot Italian opera singer dude to live jazz and tango. They also have a kids' play area and supplies for making art. What with all the interactive stuff and entertainment, the place has a real neighborhoody vibe -- when I was there a couple regulars dropped in just to say hi.  To be honest, I feel like this joint is a bit out of place here in Botoxlandia -- they would be a better fit downtown, where people aren't so fucking uptight. But, they're stuck in ToryBurchville...so I guess you could consider them a lone outpost of the real world, like a Mars colony. Next time I'm headed for Uranus, I'll stop off for sure!"}
{"text":"We just had a light dinner and wanted to have some dessert so we dec'd to make a short drive over to Tivoli Village, perfect 70° night for it.   My hursband and I shared a South Africa (lemon curd crepe) and word to the wise, they only have bottled water. They try to fancy it up your experience by giving you plastic wine glasses-- for water lol. The crepe was on the crispy side and it was the first time that I had ever had it that way. We first thought it was a mistake but if it was, it wasn't a bad one to experience, just different I guess. Usually crepes are airy and seem underdone so making it crispy give it a different texture (obviously) but it may appeal to some but for those accustomed to the airy kind of crepes, it's an odd thing to experience.  There was a live band playing and from what I heard they were young college kids who were all friends and just liked to play music. We were definitely impressed and our ears were smiling the whole time.  We'd definitely have our dessert here if we were in the area."}
{"text":"The idea of this place is great, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good, the owner ruined it through. My husband and I went for brunch while we were in town visiting. Our waitress was very nice, told us the special of the day, and then gave us a few minutes to look over the menu and decide. The owner came over and told us the special again. She asked if it was our first time there and we said yes. First time there, not first time having authentic crepes. She wouldn't leave us alone. Anytime we would answer her question by telling her what we were thinking about having, she would tell us that's not really what we wanted and basically that we wouldn't like it because we were American. I also really wanted the peanut butter, jelly, and banana crepe for dessert and she told me it was horrible and if we were going to have crepes we should have something better than that. She said she only keeps it on for the kids. Why not put it on the kids menu then? Little does she know I LOVE peanut butter and jelly and could eat peanut butter by the jar. Probably would have been the best thing ever in my book! She charges $13-$15 for a crepe and then criticizes your choice. When it came time for dessert, I wanted the Venezia, which is a cannoli crepe. She, again, came to the table to talk to us about dessert. She told me I probably wouldn't like the Venezia crepe because it's authentic Italian and they don't use a lot of sugar and that maybe I should get the Nutella crepe. Little did this rude and stuck up woman know, I'm Italian and my maiden name is in fact, Venezia. Long story short, the crepes were good, very overpriced, but good, and the owner is rude, condescending, pushy, and ruined the experience. Three stars because the crepes were good, Nutella cappuccino was good, and atmosphere was nice. We won't be going back because of the owner. She should stay behind the counter and let the wait staff interact with the customers."}
{"text":"This is a pantry kitchen operation. They have an upwards of 40 crepes, representing flavors around the world. Do the math. Your expectations can't be too great. In order to accommodate such a wide spectrum of flavors, some ingredients -- like peas and carrots -- are frozen goods. Let that set the tempo and then you won't be disappointed.   Friendly service, adorable ambiance, clean bathrooms, a little pricey for the quality of food. But remember: the cost of ambiance is built in the cost of the food and this place is located in Tivoli.   I got the two-crepe combo, pick one savory and one sweet ($22.80) and I also got a macchiato ($3). The waiter alerted me: \"It's the real Italian macchiato.\" Great! It was Lavazza.   My savory crepe as the India (cheese, cauliflower, peas with yellow korma). It was tasty. I really liked the house crepe batter. They serve all of their crepes not wrapped up like a breakfast burrito, but more like they put the crepe spread open on your plate and then just cover it with whatever your desired ingredients are.   For my sweet crepe, I got the Paris (European flan), which looked like albino diarrhea, but it was yummy. Super rich. Huge. I wouldn't advise eating one of these by yourself. Share with one or two more people.   There is inside and outside dining. Indoors, there is a little art gallery (hobbyists) and a place for kids to play with plenty of toys, and the stairway up to the Market shops and restaurants.   Pay for your meal up at the POS.   No liquor license yet. Still working on it.   #offthestrip #noncasino"}
{"text":"My mom and I had a good and pleasant experience here. Lots of crepes to choose from on the menu, plus a lot of coffee drinks and non-alcoholic cocktails. Our server was SO friendly and sweet, I wish I had caught her name! Overall, we were very satisfied."}
{"text":"Crepes are so good here! I have had some of their savory and their dessert crepes and have never been disappointed. The owner is friendly and has always come out to personally check on us every time we've been there, a nice touch! Last time I went, I had the Provence, which is a frequent special and it is my favorite by far.  On the other hand, the coffee is so, so. I had a latte that was weak and luke warm. After that I have just gone with an Americano, it's always been good.  If you have kids, the owner has a really nice section for kids set-up and they have live music most of the time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food was tasteless and my husband's crepe was crunchy. Yuck!! Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Ooh la la! We know crêpes, and this is THE best spot in Vegas to get them. Incredible selection, great wine list, wide variety from breakfast crêpes to dinner crêpes to dessert crêpes.  And le chef de cuisine, Agnes, is extremely friendly and incredibly personally engaging. We appreciated the dedicated personal service...and she didn't know us from Adam; she just was incredible and ensured her servers were on task at all times.  On our most recent visit, I had the Manhattan, which is an eggs Benedict version (ham perfectly cooked, potatoes at JUST the perfect tender-crisp threshold, a Hollandaise sauce that was obviously handcrafted with love and attention, with the correct amount of eggs and spice), and my wife had the Belgium, which includes fresh seasonal fruit (strawberries and bananas at this time, in early October), fresh whipped cream, and a light, fluffy, almost gossamer crêpe with cream that had obviously been nurtured to sweet perfection. Superb.  Best crêpes since our latest trip to Paris this summer. Seriously, in Paris, we stayed in the tony part of town with the best cafés and restaurants, and Jeanine and I agreed that The Crêpe Las Vegas has them all beat - and that's saying a LOT. (Agnes told us she trained in France under THE best chefs, and eating is believing). We'll be coming back again and again.  Magnifique! Merci beaucoup, Agnes! Nous reviendrons!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! Agnes, the Owner, is very accommodating with fabulous ideas that make this venue awesome for groups. They have a wonderful Happy Hour Mon - Fri. 2:30 - 6:30pm. Parking is easy and in a garage for those hot summer days. Everything is so fresh. I had an iced Mocha made just  to my specifications , two poached eggs and tomatoes that had this wonderful flavor. They have weekly events and a small area for children set up with a table. This is a great place for all ages. I highly recommend The Crepe."}
{"text":"The Crepe LV at Tivoli Village Rocks. You can have breakfast, lunch or dinner here or just dessert and a drink. The staff is exceptional and is one of the best places to eat in Tivoli Village. They have jazz nights and other activities and a play area for the kid's. I have had a breakfast crepe, lunch crepe, and a crepe at dinner. All were outstanding. I have had a sweet crepe as well. The staff is very accommodating and will try to make you a crepe of your choice. I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Polish Crepe. The menu stated that it was made of Polish sausage and cabbage. At least they got the cabbage part right. The sausage wasn't actually polish sausage it was made from chopped hot dogs. I payed 22 dollars for it too. I could have made a similar dish of pancakes and chopped hot dogs for 1 20th the price."}
{"text":"All right. But kind of pricey for a crepe.  I've walked past The Crepe numerous times, but decided to give it a shot for a dessert option after dinner with a friend. The restaurant is located in the Market Place of Tivoli Village. It really reminds me of a beatnik coffee shop, complete with people painting and live music (at least on the night I was there).  The menu is comprised of sweet and savory options. Honestly, the menu was much more diverse and had more selection than I thought it would. Crepes are represented by country, so I had The Venezia ($10.90), which was an indulgent crepe with cannoli cream, black and white chocolate drizzles and chips, and a dollop of whipped cream.   It was a yummy crepe and nice for dessert. However, the pricing is putting me off from returning. Perhaps if I'm in the area I may try a \"savory\" crepe next time.   Overall, it is a fun-styled establishment that makes over-priced crepes."}
{"text":"Fantastic variety of scrumptious crepes and warm friendly service.  Reminiscent of cafes in Europe.  Sometimes there is a small wait for your order, but it's not fast food (nor do we want that)!"}
{"text":"An OK place to have breakfast crepes in a nice setting. Service was on the slow side. They said their orange juice was fresh squeezed; but it certainly didn't taste like it as it was way too watery. On the plus side, they have a string quartet playing nice music and the wait staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that there is a place to get crepes close by rather than going to IHOP for one of their International breakfasts. I've been here a couple of times because I wanted to taste the array of crepes. I usually do the duo for $22.80 where you get one savory and one sweet.   Canada: Canadian bacon, eggs, potatoes, topped with toasted oats crunch and syrup. I like the mix of the lightly salted Canadian Bacon with the sweetness of the maple syrup.  Milano : fresh mozzarella, tomato basil and balsamic reduction. I noticed that the ingredients stand out more in a crepe . I typically have sandwiches made like this but the bread typically takes over. I loved swiping the remains of my crepe in the balsamic . Very tasty!  There is a variety of desert crepes you can pair with the duo. I always prefer anything with Nutella. The owners are very sweet. They expressed some interest in holding a Yelp event in their cafe. They were mentioning having different crepes from their menu passed around. It would be more of the international crepes. I told them they can get a hold of the Yelp community manger to set one up.   I also love the scenery . I  like sitting by the big windows so I can people watch. When I look outside It doesn't even feel like I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant evening here with a friend. We met the chef Agnus(or was it Angus? I'm sorry if it is a mistake), she was very knowledgeable in her business and was very kind to us. We had a crepe duo, one savory and one sweet. Our savory dish was the Morocco, as recommended by Agnus as something I've never tried. It was the most interesting flavor I've ever tasted in a crepe. It was sweet, tangy, and a little spicy all at the same time and very subtle.   We had the Europa as our sweet crepe. It is filled with Nutella and fresh fruit. It was utterly delicious. The Nutella was not overwhelming and the fruit went well with it. The crepes were perfectly cooked. As the chef said, \"You cannot cut it with a fork, you must use a knife. If you can eat it with just a fork then your crepe is undercooked.\"  We also had a Monaco(creme brulee) and it was the best creme Brule I've ever had in my life. Everything on it and in it all had its own special taste. I heard this was a popular dish here, and would highly recommend it.   Their cappuccino was also very good too!!  Not to mention we got some things on the house, but that is not why it was so great as not everyone reading this should go and expect it ;p but the reason why I mention it is that the people who work there know how to be impressionable. Not just the chef, the waiters and waitresses too.  hope you try try them out and enjoy your experience like I did!:)"}
{"text":"So happy we found this little gem in Tivoli Village. Tried the Italy and Manhattan and both were delicious. The New York and Venezia crepes for dessert were delicious. Go up the stairs for a hidden wine bar with a nice little view."}
{"text":"I love crepe and I've been to a lot of places that serves crepe. This is the worst I've had so far. The crepes were overrated and nothing special about it. Way too expensive for a crepe. The owner is always in a hurry and nobody checks if you need anything else. I won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The crepes here just do NOT warrant the price. Ya ya I know it's in Tivoli Village so expect to pay more, and believe me I have no problem paying a lot for a good crepe, but these are mediocre. My nutella and berry crepe had no flavor and my son ordered the Hawaiian which holy smokes had WAY to much sauce!! I mean it was so drenched with sauce he could barely eat it it was so sweet. Easy on the sauce folks! I would way rather drive to Crepe Expectations for an amazing crepe at a decent price. $14 for a sauce soaked crepe is NOT good!  On the plus side, the ambiance is very nice and the service was very good. This would be a nice place for a lunch meeting or to study."}
{"text":"This place might be just be the worst restaurant I have ever been at. The food wasn't that horrible but it certainly wasn't great.   1. They don't serve tap water, supposedly they are too small.  2. If you can't, fine. Just don't charge me 1.50 for a small bottle of pure life. 3. Today, it seems they were only taking reservations before one o'clock.  Yet they had a sign that said seat yourself and the girl at the register said we could sit anywhere. 4. I think it was Alex the owner who was bussing tables and walked between people instead of around them the entire time. I am aware that the shortest distance is a straight line but don't make your guests uncomfortable by squeezing past me for no reason. 5. We shared the Britain.  It was a crepe filled with undercooked potatoes and bacon and decent eggs. Maybe I don't fully grasp the crepe thing but I would suggest that crisp bacon and cooked potatoes might be more appealing. 6. If I had one more person ask me if I wanted a desert after eating a breakfast crepe and not take no for an answer I would have screamed. They offered us a free father's day crepe when we got there and we said yes but they made us wait for something we DIDN'T ask for.  7. One waitress we didn't know stopped to ask me about my walking dead shirt. She knew the show but only because her mom watches it. She informed us in quite a snooty fashion that she reads. Good for her.  Chef Agnes, what can I say? She was telling the people next to us that they were waiting so long because of the aforementioned reservation that was needed before 1 pm. Then she said it was miscommunication with the staff and that they should have never been seated and did they want some hot sauce because the crepe they ordered wasn't very flavorful.  I didn't just remember those things and put them in my own run on sentence, that is how she said it.  I have been to three highly recommended crepe places on Yelp. I don't get it I guess. However, the overall weirdness of this place reminds me of that Kitchen Nightmares in Arizona with the blonde and the old guy.....so they would have to make the best food ever to get more than one star."}
{"text":"The Crepe is located in Tavoli Village inside The Market. I was there early Sunday morning and there was street parking available, so I was able to park in front of The Crepe. There is also valet and self parking available. It is small place which also has outside seating. The only complaint I had was the tables were about as big as the plates I usually eat off....I'm a big guy. I get it though...French. Petite furniture....lol. There was also a violinist and a guitar player playing some type of ethnic music. I did not inquire to what type of music they were playing.  The menu has a great selection of crepes and if you do not see anything you like, which I am sure will not happen, you can build your own crepe. There are crepes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desert. The crepes are named after different regions of the world that best represents the ingredients inside the crepe. I like the fact that they offer whole wheat, buckwheat, vegan, and white crepes.  We ordered the following and they were all equally excellent!! They were served with sides of almond pâté' and chili sauce. The almond pâté' was awesome!  -Mediterranean with a vegan wrap minus the cheese. - Mushrooms, red peppers, tomatoes, spinach, and broccoli.  -Brenton - A crepe wrapped around fresh berries and topped with agave syrup.  -The Florida - A crepe filled with Key Lime and then toped with crushed graham crackers, Key Lime sauce, and fresh whipped cream. ****My Favorite****  The total: 5 crepes 2 coffees 1 orange juice 3 bottled water $77.38  I will have to say that crepes are not very filling and I could have eaten about 5 of them by myself, but they were very good. I will definitely be back!!  --Don't forget to grab a punch card--"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Their philosophy is to try to capture the flavors of a specific region.. They try to be very creative with their food and flavors! We tried the Argentinian crepe and it was  delicious!! It was made of grilled meat and chimichurri sauce which we learned was homemade! I ordered the Greek crepe and the flavors were great!! For desert we ordered the Nutella which was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The Nutella was a bit overwhelming, but the fruit was pretty fresh! The owner recommended to get the crembrule, so i guess next time i will do that! The service was very good and the owners were very personable with their clients! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Lets start what what we enjoyed about The Crepe... We came on a Saturday night and they had a fantastic Jazz quartet - they were honestly excellent musicians. The ambiance is really cute. Super open, airy, European, chic, and trendy. I loved the fact that they had an open children's play area. we have little ones so that is a definite plus in my book.  The waitresses that helped up were both very sweet and pleasant. When our Venezia crepe was brought out to us it looked delicious...if only the taste of it agreed with the presentation of it.   The Venezia description was \"cannoli cream, black and white chocolate.\" My husband and I both love cannolis, but if your hoping for something that tastes anything like a cannoli you will be sorely disappointed. The filling was curdy and rather runny, the white chocolate chips on top tasted super cheap, and the crepe itself had a strange lemony flavor that did not at all belong. We both took about 5 bites and tried to talk ourselves into liking it, but in the end just couldn't do it... Definitely a waste of $9.   That being said.... because of the great live Jazz and the children's play area we will probably be back and get something safe like a tea or milkshake...."}
{"text":"This place ended up being one of the meeting places for the \"Girlz\".. Didn't have any expectations but I have to admit, we all tried one another's dish And talk about yummy...our bill was a bit pricey but that could have been from all the Belinis or Mimosas we drank, but I would definitely recommend this place. Chef Agnes came over and checked on us a couple of times, which we really liked. Yes, yes, yes..."}
{"text":"The crepe is an excellent and quaint breakfast shop. The food is always fresh and made with care. The people are attentive and courteous. The vibe is very curbside euro cafe. I always enjoy visiting when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful presentation and great customer service. Feels like a little piece of culture right in Las Vegas. Love the vibe."}
{"text":"We had to wave at the server to give us a menu coz we have been sitting for 10 minutes - my latte took 15 minutes to make- this place  needs organization- servers doesn't seem to know what's going on- they act like its busy when there's more severs than customers !! the vibe here is just hectic and service is just bad- the food we don't know and never will coz we walked out after waiting for two crepes for an hour!! Also The female chef had a cast around her hand- isn't that against health code ?"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Friendly staff assisted my boyfriend and I with creating a vegan crepe trio. Peanut butter and banana, pineapple with guava jam, and strawberry. The vegan crepe batter was wonderful. Craving more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing dynamic place and shocked to see people haven't rated this place higher. A fine mix of great food and real creativity and culture. We had delicious crepes while listening to a live string quartet. An absolute gem!"}
{"text":"I thought everyone's opinion made this a safe place to live it up..... Wrong.  Didn't try the food, thank God, as the small house payment for two coffees smaller than a senior cup at McDonalds was horrifying enough!  As we waited for our coffee every employee in the place approached us at least twice to try to seat us. Not in a solicitous way, more of a creepy, boss stalker way.  Wouldn't go back for a free crepe, luckily I don't think they would offer. A crepe is probably more costly than most vacations.  It tasted ok, but was $9 for what was seriously less than 1/2 cup TOTAL coffee in two cups.  Even the server apologized that my tiny cup was mostly empty. I think cocaine us cheaper."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I waited so long to try this place as Crepe's are one of my most favorite things in the entire world. I LOVE CREPE'S!  So from what it seemed, the owner was there. If she was, she was wonderful. So friendly and helpful. She also made excellent recommendations on what to order.   We had: The Bavarian Special (sweet), the Italy and the Manhattan. They were all excellent.   The best thing: They had live Cellist's and Violinist's playing beautiful classical music. My two favorite instruments. So, lucky me.   I really don't have anything else to say other than this place is lovely. From the service, atmosphere, food and location. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch has live string music. Chef Angus is very involved in her business and cares about quality.  She would rather be out of a product due to in climate weathers and low production then just buying it from anywhere. If you haven't had a real Bellini then you need to visit this place for brunch. This is not a Bellini with some artificial peach schnapps. This is a real Bellini handmade. The Mimosa has fresh squeezed orange juice also. They have a big menu that is sure to pleAse any taste bud from breakfast to dinner to dessert."}
{"text":"Can't really say I am a crepe guy honestly...usually they just don't satisfy my hunger, so I end up eating two of them to feel satisfied....then I just wished I had a traditional breakfast LOL.  Just not my style of breakfast is all.  Thankfully, \"The Crepe's\" savory portions are a bit larger than others I've had in the past.  I'd still probably need the second one, but at least I don't feel hungry immediately afterwards eating only one.  The reason I am giving the extra star was due to the Mommy/Daddy & Me deal, where the little ones get a FREE crepe (sweet or savory) just half portioned.  This lets Little Foodie and me eat relatively well for a fair price!  We tried the Germany ($10.50): Bratwurst, Sauerkraut, Pickles, Green Onion & Mustard Sauce. Interesting combination, but it works well! Good size and pretty filling considering it's a crepe lol.   Italy ($9.80): Cured Prosciutto, Scrambled Eggs, Italian Cheese, Tomatoes & Pesto Sauce.  A bit less filling than the Germany, but I enjoyed the flavors here.  Europa ($6.50 Kid's size): Nutella & Fruit. Just like it sounds...with plenty of Nutella hiding inside!  Some places are a bit stingy with the goods, but they LAYER Nutella in there :)  Would be worth checking out if you are in the area, esp with a little one!  Right next to the park, so let the little ones work off that sugar when you're finished :P"}
{"text":"I'll start with what I liked about this place. The server who invited me inside as I was checking out the menu by the door was very friendly and attentive, the place is pretty, and I love that the Market offers free wifi. I needed to get some work done on my laptop. It was a good place for that.   After I saw that the crepes were out of my price range for today, I decided to order a tropical fruit smoothie. They couldn't tell me what exactly was in it. I was thirsty and I like tropical fruit, so I didn't care that much. I'm sure it was probably the same frozen bag I usually get from Trader Joe's with pineapple/mango/strawberries/bananas. I asked them to make it with soy milk. I wasn't disappointed with the taste, it was pretty much exactly what I expected.   But the portion?! I will let the picture speak for itself. Seven dollars and some change, after tax. I saw an employee replying to other reviews, trying to justify the high prices by saying that they \"favor organic produce.\" Cool, me too. That's how I know that for the same price, I could go into Whole Foods (couple minutes away from here) and get SIXTEEN ounces of smoothie, know every fresh not frozen ingredient in there, and if I wanted to get twelve ounces, I could even add some bee pollen or protein and it would be the same price as the child-size one that I got. At least cut the straw so it's proportionate to the smoothie cup.   It's an okay place. Very nice ambience, and friendly service. I probably still won't be back. I can't comment on the food besides it smelling delicious and looking nice, but if you're thinking of getting a smoothie while you're there, that's what you can expect."}
{"text":"Outside the door I got a coupon for a certain amount off from the owner, and I told her that I would walk around more before I decided if I wanted to eat there. After looking at all the restaurants, I chose this place.   You sit yourself, so I sat somewhere close to the front. I really wanted to try a bunch of the crepes and was going to go with the Trio. You get 3 small crepes, which I believe I could devour. I sat there for about 10 minutes with servers walking by over and over.   Finally, a server noticed me and asked me what I wanted to drink, and since I was there for a while looking over the menu I knew which crepes I wanted to try. Well I didn't read the small print and on the menu it shows certain times you can get the trio..and I wasn't there around the right time.   The coupon wasn't even valid now, because I had to spend a certain amount, which now I wasn't.   I ordered the Russia with cottage cheese and fruit. The food didn't take long at all.   I am so sad to say I really did not like it. When it said cottage cheese, I thought of curds. This was cream? My crepe was filled with cream and canned fruit... I really hated the mouth full of pudding cream... The dough was all rubber, and that was even hard to eat.. I left so much on my plate. It was so expensive, for food I didn't eat.   I had so many bad crepes here in Vegas. Only found one place I am happy with and I already wrote a review for that place. That place is on the strip."}
{"text":"Pretty decent crepes..I prefer the sweet ones over the savory but they have this international menu where the names of the items are cities and countries around the world..I enjoyed the options but need to go try more..it's just 4 stars for now it can change for sure"}
{"text":"I love enjoying a freshly made crepe at the restaurant everytime I come to get my wax at BOX. I would rate this a 5 Star review however I always have to wait 30 minutes for a to go order. Other than that this place is affordable , very entertaining and the host are all friendly."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today.  Here is what I love about this place. . . it is a relaxing, fun, interesting place to eat with good food.  Yes, you can get big portions and fast service (with a hectic environment!) at a place like Egg Works.  This place has a European feel to it.  The food was carefully prepared, right down to the side of fruit that was nicely presented.  The coffee is excellent (espresso beverages and large selection of dairy-free creamer options if you don't drink milk).  They have great entertainment (jazz some evenings, some open mic and comedy others, puppet shows and story times for kids in the afternoons, classical music on Sunday mornings).  The owners here clearly understand that eating out is an experience.  I will agree with other reviewers that it took a while for our food and one order came out of order (people who arrived after us, a smaller party, got their food first), but I really enjoyed lingering here.  I enjoyed my coffee, , the music, and actually being able to talk to my husband while my kids quietly played in the kids' area.  It was a pleasant place to hang out while eating, which I love!  I guess my advice based on the other reviews and my experience would be don't come if you are starving and/or in a rush to get somewhere or if you are a very impatient person.  But this place is perfect for catching up with a friend or enjoying a relaxing weekend brunch, or if you are dining alone and want to catch up on work, a book, or e-mail.  There aren't many places in Vegas like this.    As a mom, my first favorite thing about this place is that they have a nice little play area towards the back for kids - blocks, a little train building thing, board games, puppets, paper/crayons, etc.  Awesome!  It was wonderful to let my little ones play quietly while I relaxed and enjoyed the live classical music for Sunday Brunch!  Normally eating out with my kids is kind of stressful and frustrating, but I had my best meal in a restaurant with my kids today because of how they laid this place out in a thoughtful way for families.  My kids aren't badly behaved, but like all kids, they have a low tolerance for sitting around with nothing to do.  They clearly designed this place with that in mind, so that parents can relax and children are content (which means children are quiet and less annoying to patrons without kids)."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place, and today while walking around tivoli realized they have an indoor play area.  An indoor play area that's not a mcdonalds?  Since we have a three year old we were sold.  Service was really sweet and friendly-- I love being able to support a family owned business.  And our crepes were great, too.  Did I mention their indoor play area for kids meant I actually got to sit and eat my food for once?    It did take a bit for the crepes to come out, so if you are looking for instantaneous food you will probably be disappointed.  I didn't mind though, and the manager mentioned to me they are hiring more staff in an effort to be a little faster.  For me, even with the wait, as long as my kid was entertained I didn't mind sitting and visiting with my husband for awhile.    We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a bit of a late post but needed nevertheless. I'm always on the hunt for a quaint small business to support vs commercial. I came here with family and we all ordered  the sweet/savory crepe deal. Dinner and dessert for one price, who can beat that! We had savory first:  Italy(cured prosciutto, eggs, Italian cheese, parsley, tomatoes, topped with pesto sauce), Hawaii(pulled pork, vegetables in pineapple sauce), and France(ham, egg, farm cheese, scallions, parsley, tomatoes topped with béchamel sauce) and then the sweet: New York(cheese cake and seasonal berries) and Austria(strudel-style with cinnamon-caramelized apples) Everything was really good, the dessert crepes were a little too sweet for me, but i've always been a savory type of girl. While we were there a jazz band was setting up, it was just a really cool scene. The day after I was already recommending this place to a co-worker. All in all we will definitely be returning with our punch cards at hand!"}
{"text":"They've come a long way since they started , the service is actually fast ( I was surprised to read other reviews ) the crepes are healthy and delicious and the owner is always super nice to us , they have a little play area inside for the kiddos , love it ;)"}
{"text":"Ok at best. I've been here a number of times and each time I want to like this place. Sadly I do not like this place very much. The only reason I stayed last time was for the kids area. The food is no good. The service is not very friendly. The drinks selection is small and not good.   I ordered 2 drinks and one duo crepe plate (two crepes). It cost me $44.  wowza. This is a glorified pancake nothing special!! It was a caprese crepe. Uh I'm sorry but it isn't caprese with no basil! They are in desperate need of some salt and some  flavor!! Please I will not be back because this was a waste of my money!"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it.  what a great Sunday Morning o sit out side and have a great meal.  everything cooked to perfection.  Agnes, the owner, is a delight and gives get recommendations.  Always has so many specials that it always is a difficult choice trying to narrow it down.  All six of us had something different.  Each looked amazing."}
{"text":"It's the best place to hang out and eat the best crepes. Mediterranean and European one are amazing. You should come over and check the menu is made for every type of taste.there are also weekly events - my favorite are mommy and me and Art&Wine. I'm very impressed by this little place, you can have breakfasts or lunch and be still very healthy. Come and check it out."}
{"text":"Both my friend and I had horrible food and even worse service. If you want a great crepe then skip this place and just head to Paris on the strip. I will give it one star since the chef/owner was nice enough and offered to make us something else but she did tell us that the crepes we ordered \"had no flavor\" and to order something else. Really, a chef knowingly creating dishes that she feels aren't good?  Bizarre! I could write on and on about their unknowledgable servers, lack of products (lemon, water, creamer - to name a few) and filthy restrooms but I'll spare myself the agony and awful memories."}
{"text":"Visited with my two sisters and daughter and was rather disappointed. Loved the decor and feel of Europe, however we were very disappointed with the quality of the crepes. I've been enjoying crepes for more than 20 years and was taught by a very good friend of mine to make crepes at home (French style). We'd seen this restaurant and really  were eager to give it a try. Service was pretty slow. Our order was not complete, so we had to ask the server to cancel a soup since we were almost finished out meal. We were told by our server that the chef was giving her a hard time in the kitchen. When we finally went up to pay for our meal, which no one ever came over to tell us that we needed to see the cashier. However, we did not receive a bill. So, we assumed the server was coming back to complete everything. When we signaled to a waiter, he explained that we needed to go to the cashier to pay. Our server was not visible and the cashier explained that she was given the task to help us at the last minute. Too many excuses for shortfalls."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for the Streetfest @ Tivoli Village and decided to try this place. We shared a breakfast crepe called the Switzerland which was delicious with broccoli, asparagus, carrots, and cheese. Really moist and tasty! We also split the dessert crepe titled Venezia! Luscious chocolate, and cannoli creme. Very rich! Very busy place so service was meh, but I would come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, first time posting a review in forever!  I've had a grand change in my life with new work and new town, and of course bunch of new restaurants to try!  I had all the intentions to catch up on all the reviews for the past 6 weeks or so, but then it became too many and now I've given up on that.  So now that I don't have to worry about that, I'm starting with today!  My first is an adorable big place called The Crepe in Tivoli Village.  There is so much to like about this place besides the food.   Will critique the food separately, but will bullet-point the rest:   - The adorable, highly talkative owner Agnes  - The special events every day and evening (readings, DJs, guests, tastings, you name it)  - Big place with spacious room between seatings  - In Tivoli, a very cool place  - Absolutely divine crepe pancake that is light and paper thin  - Fresh ingredients, many from local vendors, Agnes said  - Not just a restaurant - I didn't pay attention too much but they have books, gifts, retail foods, etc.  - Reasonable prices for an upscale feel (in a way)   Only thing I wasn't crazy about is the price of the beverages - high with no real choice for more reasonable quaffs.  Now, the food.  I had the France crepe, with ham, eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and parsley.  First of all, the crepe wafer is divine - light and paper thin, with slight crunchiness on the edges and soft in the middle.  It was just perfect.  The sauce was delicious, sort of bernaise-like but with a hint of sweetness that was ideal.   The taste was a bit peculiar, however.  Although they didn't mention it, there was a distinct taste of sage which I didn't think went well with the rest.  It overpowered the other flavors.   As a result, I wasn't in love with the overall flavor and this is the reason they don't get a 5-star rating.  But I can't wait to try the sweet crepes, which are what I really love anyway.  Tougher to mess that up on the inside on these and the wafer itself is divine, as I already mentioned.  That should make for a fabulous breakfast, and I'm DEFINITELY coming here on a weekend morning and ordering one of their sweet crepes and a cup of (again, expensive) joe.  That might cause me to bump this place up to a 5.  Table-for-1 Factor:  This is another big like for me.  Perfect for a solo guest to enjoy with their coffeehouse-like feel."}
{"text":"THE LIFE DELIZIOSA! GF, vegan and vegetarian menu items.  We enjoy the many opportunities for live music and the afternoon story times. Always a kind, friendly, and attentive experience. Please keep adding organic options and foods free of HFCS, coloring, and preservatives."}
{"text":"I would actually rate this 3.5 stars. I stopped in one morning because, well, I love crepes. I was excited since this is pretty close to where I live. I rolled in early around 930am and was one of only a couple customers. The owner Agnes, a very nice lady, seated me and ordered me a coffee. Her refrigerator was having issues and the servicemen were there looking perplexed.  She was also training a new waitress, so it was a little bumpy as far as service but that stuff doesn't bother me. We had a nice conversation regarding how difficult it is to find good employees.  I had the USA sweet crepe, which is basically peanut butter and jelly, with bananas, or so I thought. No bananas came with mine, so maybe I had to request them. It was pretty good, very thin crepe. I wasn't overwhelmed by it. I think it was about $8, and the coffee was $4.  I\"m sure I'll be back, at least to sample the entertainment at night plus one of the savory crepes. They do have a nice menu with lots of variety.  I wish the place success, and Agnes success. Tivoli Square has been rough on a number of restaurants, and other than happy hour at Kabuki I usually don't even go there anymore because there's just not much going on."}
{"text":"Very very very slow service the host is pushy and order came wrong twice!  Buon appetite.  p.s. we were one of only 2 tables in this horrible place and waited  46 min before our bed food showed up ."}
{"text":"Great place for any time of the day. The crepes are amazing. I had a chorizo, hispanic inspired, crepe. The taste was amazing. The owner, Agnes, is what makes this place unique. She comes to your table and interacts with you. She also is willing to accommodate any tastebuds upon request. Sage was our waitress. She was very friendly. This is going to be one of my new favorite places in Vegas. The service, interaction, and food this place offers is hard to find. Thanks for everything, Agnes and Sage."}
{"text":"First time coming to this little jewel in Tivoli Village. The food was excellent it is gluten-free and vegan if you choose. I understand they also have a food truck. Will have to keep on the lookout for these folks. Very good!"}
{"text":"Had Christmas Day brunch - absolutely fabulous crepes and marvelous staff.  Enjoyed breakfast crepes and shared a sweet one !  Will definitely go again and again.  Sweet sounding string trio today !"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband, we both love crepes and were happy to have a place to eat it close to home, since we love those from Jean Philippe but it's too far from our house. Disappointment is the word. We ordered a regular coffee, they said they just have expresso, so she suggested the americano for $3, I don't like to be pushed, but ok. Then my husband ordered two glasses of water and they said they don't have tap water, only mineral because they don't have a filter for water, so how to they do their juices? To finish, the salmon crepe was good but the apple one completely tasteless. So, nothing good at all. Won't go back and don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try The Crepe's gluten free option but when the waitress told me the batter was buckwheat I decided against it. Buckwheat ins't what I would be using to make a crepe. If they try Gluten free Bisquick or use cup 4 cup maybe I'll return. Luckily for me the farmers market was going on so I was able to get a fresh smoothie from one of the vendors.    My mom and sister however tried two of the breakfast crepes. They took a little while to come out and both left saying their crepes were.... \"interesting\" and dont think they will be returning anytime soon.   My Mom had the FRANCE - ham, eggs, farm cheese, scallions,  chopped parsley, tomatoes topped with béchamel sauce. Her crepe was swimming in the bechamel which had no taste at all.   My Sister on the other hand had the CANADA - Canadian bacon, egg, potato hush and maple syrup topped with toasted oats crunch. Her's was swimming in maple syrup.  I really hope this place makes it but based on what I saw on Saturday, It doesn't look to promising."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly, and the space was super cute. Located right inside the Tivoli shopping center, this little crepery was really quaint. The crepes themselves are okay. Not great, not bad. A little pricey, but I can tell the ingredients are fresh.   They do have both savory and sweet crepes. I got the \"France\" crepe, which had yummy goat cheese, ham, scallions, eggs, tomatoes, and covered w/ bechamel. Flavor was okay, but like I said, not the best ever."}
{"text":"Such amazing crepes, granted have just had the sweet but i'm sure the savory is just as good.  They use organic ingredients and the batter is wonderful.  Great atmosphere, very laid back and it is family run for now.  They are wonderful and as i said the food is amazing.  By far one of the best crepes I've ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place! We were very excited to try it and glad we did! The chef is very friendly, we have had many conversations with her. She really puts her heart into this place!  I read some of the other reviews and yes, it's true, when they first opened they did not have much decor and did not have enough menus - no big deal! I go to a restaurant for food and for the experience, not the decor! The decor is coming along and they now have enough menus. They just opened and sometimes when a restaurant first opens, it's a little disorganized.   I have tried several of their crepes - from sweet to savory. I prefer savory to sweet so I have tried more of the savory options. All have been tasty! The only critique is regarding the Indian Curry Style crepe - I feel like it should have had more spice! Or at least the option to add spice.   I support this The Crepe because it is a wonderful concept,  they use locally grown food and they have plenty of options for people with dietary restrictions (gluten free, Vegan). Also, the food is GOOD!"}
