{"text":"The food and the sevice was good! The beer I ordered had pamplemousse taste which goes well with the food. We were 5 and should've doubled the plates we ordered because one plate was enough for 2-3 to taste but not enough for 5 people! They should change their playlist there because songs were jazzy, the next one was slow, then hip hop which was weird."}
{"text":"Non mais quel bar mignon, j'ai adoré la déco! Et puis le choix de cocktails wow. Tout est bon, il en a pas mal pour les fans d'apérol. Je vous conseille d'essayer le mojito, pas trop sucré juste la parfaite balance de goût."}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious food, fantastic drinks, and amazing value. Great for a 5à7, even better for an intimate date.  Food: The flavour speaks for itself. The Caribbean-inspired dishes carry an incredible taste, are fun to eat and share, and compliment the vibrant restaurant atmosphere.  Drink: Wide selection of amazing beers from local microbrews, great cocktails, and even awesome light-weight/non-alcoholic options (e.g., kombucha and cider)."}
{"text":"Great little bar with delicious and creative shared plates. The food was excellent. The service was excellent - prompt and friendly. The beers were creative - we really liked the OPA and hibiscus infused beer was inventive albeit didn't meet our personal tastes. We would be interested in returning to try the other creative beers and would recommend this place to a friend. The standout, however, was the food. It was such a pleasant surprise, knowing nothing about the place when we walked by and decided to give it a try. We're glad we did!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was opening, with names like \"dude from Joe Beef\" and \"dude from Mal Neccesaire\" it sounded promising :P We stopped by on a Wednesday evening after an art show at the SAT. The place is cute, simply decorated and feels laid back  The cocktail list isn't as diverse as I thought it would be, with the reputation of Le Mal Neccesaire but if you have a drink in mind, the bartender will gladly make it for u. I don't drink beers so I can't speak for that but the beer menu looked pretty interesting! I ordered the Donde Mis Zapatos (lol!!!) and it was alright, not bad but nothing to write home about either.  We ordered the jerk cauliflower, the tandoori wings and roasted asparagus. I think the food was my prefered part, everything was very well seasoned and balanced in flavor. Deliciousness!!!!!   I'd come back for some more food ya!"}
{"text":"Premièrement c'est une très beau bar à oeil, belle carte de bière mais plus des bière avec moins ibu. C'est très jeune et ce n'est pas un brew bar aucune ambiance de ce type de place 5/10"}
