{"text":"Love love love this place. I've been a customer for a couple of years but recently went again last week for dinner. We arrived slightly before the dinner rush so we grabbed the comfy corner table by the window. They have fresh sushi and delicious ramen. On my most recent visit, I got the sukiyaki udon served with rice and my boyfriend got the tempura udon. Although the sukiyaki was a bit expensive ($17), it was delicious and rich! It comes with an assortment of veggies, tofu, udon, and thinly sliced beef. It's a great spot for a date too! ;)"}
{"text":"Authentic, well-prepared casual Japanese fare.  A little pricey but mostly in its own category as few restaurants in the city offer what they do.   Best bets: futomaki, hiyashi-chuka in the summertime (cold ramen salad), udon, katsudon.   I would give this place more stars but the service is always cold and lacking spirit. For being a somewhat regular customer over the years it would be nice to be greeted with a bit of a smile."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back again. Not only for sushi but also the hot dishes there are awesome. Highly recommend the ramen and curry katsu don."}
{"text":"tiny little restaurant owned by real japanese people.  my food experience was just meh. not anything too amazing compared to other japanese restaurants.  i realized they really like to use ALOT of soysauce on everything cause all of my appettizers (gyoza, fish cakes) were much too salty. i didn't like it.  as for the main course, i ordered the sashimi/ sushi platter which was $16.75 for 10 pieces of fish, 3 california roll and 3 cucumber rolls! coming into the restaurant i thought it looked homey and would have an authentic feel/taste to it but it didn't. the fish i believe, did not taste fresh at all. other places were served cold and crisp but this sashimi was warm and soggy. ended the night with tofu/green tea ice cream which was okay minus the tofu part cause it tasted really sour, made my ice cream taste horrible. maybe thats just my opinion but i didn't really like the food here. i also think everything was just a bit too over-priced.  i did not get my moneys worth."}
{"text":"Went there just before summer, cozy little place, with price worthy delicate sushi! Guess that's Genuie Japanese style, about $20-30 per sushi entree, large fish meat, with wasabi inside, not the cheap sushi places~  Also ordered a beef don, not expensive at all, just $10 sth but super delicious! very juicy! with medium cooked egg......the juicy rice......yum......  luv this place! with the warm corner!"}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing incredible however the atmosphere and service was definitely something far above average."}
{"text":"In short:  Konnichiwa is a small Japanese restaurant whose space is outfitted in a way that generates a warm and inviting atmosphere to go along with your yummy food!   I had the nabeyaki udon and I was completely satisfied with the whole dish. The broth was perfectly umami, without the harsh taste of powdered MSG. Udon tasted homemade, and had a good level of cooked-but-springy density. The tempura tasted fresh and crispy. (My favourite was the acorn squash!)  My friend ordered the tonkatsu ramen with gyoza and she was enjoyed her meal as well. (As a measure of comparison, we are both devotees of Sansotei ramen.)  It seems Konnichiwa is an expert at casual Japanese cuisine. The prices here may be slightly higher than your run-of-the-mill place, but I would say it's worth it.   (Fun fact: the chef, Kohei Matsuyama, has had high-level training in haute cuisine dining and packs over 20 years experience working at prestigious restaurants in Tokyo and Toronto.)"}
{"text":"Heard good reviews because they're authentic japanese chefs..the price was super steep and the food overall experience was just mediocre.  for the price i paid ($25) and the amount I received i should have went to all you can eat instead."}
{"text":"The cashier was angry when I gave her a wrong coin which inccidentally went into the money I gave her (I had that coin from my last destination). I was really satisfied with the food, but can't give the stars as much for the food as the cashier was saying \"this price is not including tip\" for three times with her face look angry. I meant to tip at first BTW."}
{"text":"Uni lovers...this one's for you! Find your bliss in this cozy (and often busy) Japanese restaurant. Checkered table cloths, tightly packed tables, wood panels and adorable cartoon drawings decorating the chalk-board menu complete the homey, lived-in vibe: zero pretense here, folks.   Being the uni and ikura addict I am, I ordered the uni sushi, the ikura sushi as well as the (very satisfying) ikura and salmon sashimi rice bowl: everything was absolutely fresh, absolutely delicious. Uni lovers: the portion of uni was generous, which was a definite treat. I've been 3 more times since my first visit in the summer and each time, the quality of the service and the freshness of the fish was excellent.   Miso soup arrived steaming hot (read as perfect) and my waitress delivered prompt service.   Big group? Special date?  I'd either call ahead or go early: the space is smallish and it gets busy, especially for dinner--though I've gone by in the summer time for lunch and found the patio packed too. Popular is as popular does, so don't swing in expecting that you'll be seated. If you come at peak times, it'll be tricky.   I'll definitely be visiting Konnichiwa again for that delicious ikura and sashimi rice bowl and the fresh, generous portions of uni sushi.   About the bill: it was worth it. But, as any uni lover will tell you: eat a lot of uni, expect to fork out a lot of cash. Which I did. And I have no regrets."}
{"text":"Love the Beef Sukiyaki!  The have the best tasting broth ever!  The rest of the food is pretty good too! Great place for lunch for those that work in the Dundas/University area."}
{"text":"Confusing menu. Poor service. Mediocre food at ridiculous prices."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a month. Food is great, and try their dessert sometimes... Their tofu ice cream (?) was better than I have imagined.  Recently, though, they changed their menu and increased their prices. All in all, if you wanna impress a girl on the first date, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Busy spot for lunch. Efficient staff who do just enough for a comfortable interlude. Tasty tasty food. Served w miso soup"}
{"text":"Best and authentic Japanese foods you would ever get in town. Small but cozy family restaurant with cute and creative decorations inside. I always come here to dine in because the foods are fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Still the favourite Japanese place on Baldwin.  The sushi is good, the noodles excellent and the (Japanese) curry superb. Got a great ambience, too, as a small and cozy place.  Only drawback is in the summer lunch rush, with the patio full, service can be a tad slow."}
{"text":"The first time I hear the name, I thought it is one of those scam restaurants opened by Chinese that can not make Japanese food. It was a pleasant surprise to find out this little cozy restaurant was runned by Japanese and delivers authentic Japanese food. Strongly recommend everyone to eat the dinner special as it is cheap and delicious. It is a little restaurant located on Baldwin Village, I decided to give it a try because I am sick of going to Kinton. The Chirashi (sashimi on rice) portion was huge and all the fish were very fresh. I was too full to have dessert because the Chirashi was that good, I felt the need to finish the whole bowl."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day a few days ago for dinner. Located in the Baldwin Village where it's hidden away from the busy Chinatown.  My boyfriend said this place has really great homemade and authentic Japanese food. We were able to get reservations within hours of arriving for dinner.  I ordered Udon with Tempura and my boyfriend ordered the Ramen (with Miso Broth) with Egg and Chicken.  The food was delicious! Both udon and ramen were homemade and you can definitely taste the difference in comparison to other restaurants. The assorted tempura was very impressive! It's the first time that I ate tempura that didn't leave me wanting no more. The tempura tasted clean...not oily at all. I've had tempura where the batter left oil marks everywhere but Konnichiwa left me wanting for more.   We also ordered the Soft Shell Crab. It hit the spot and left me very satisfied.  I will for sure return to Konnichiwa!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this Great little sushi restaurant. Seaweed salad is delicious and flavourful. Orders a spicy salmon roll, soft shell crab roll, negi hamachi Roll and a California roll. Very fresh. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Decent but the regular Japanese food is better than the sushi.   Good service. Japanese owned and operated."}
{"text":"Pleasant dinner experience. Authentic Japanese dishes that is hard to find anywhere else. I recommend the hot pots, sukiyaki and most grilled dishes. Was not there for sashimi or sushi, so cannot comment. Its a small, cozy space with pleasant service. Dessert was OK, but would probably skip the next time."}
{"text":"Cute little place, feeling like in a Japanese family. However, the food is average. After having chirashi at japango, this one is really disappointing. The got different sashimi and it is fresh, but I don't like the rice. It's sour. The dumpling is tasty, but you can definitely make one at home. I love the deco here. It is small and warm. I also love the neighborhood. It is my first been in this area. It is really cute and got a lot of attractive places."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall type of restaurant. Efficient and friendly Japanese service. Delicious sashimi and some of the best gyoza I've had, and I rarely eat it. Miso soup and miso ramen were boasting with flavor. The ramen noodles I'm told are not made in house and were more soft than those I'm used to where they are made in house. I personally prefer an 'al dente' ramen noodle over these. Not my fave. Love the place and would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite ramen spots in Toronto.   Not overly complicated like some of the pretentious new ramen spots around town but each dish will still surprise you.   The ramen bowls are really good and much less lardy than Kinton down the road. You'll get a great meal for $10 but try the great gyoza or karaage!"}
{"text":"Cute and small. Very good bento box with good quality food! Would recommend for a casual date night!"}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for here: deliciously fresh fish with a texture as smooth as butter. We ordered a sashimi platter that came with an assortment of white fish, salmon, tuna, squid, and octopus. It doesn't look like a whole lot, but it's actually good enough to share between two people along with another small entree.  Their chicken teriyaki is also good, but nothing extraordinary. Something that is nice about this small establishment is that they provide the tea bags with your green tea, and a little dish for you to keep your tea bag until you're ready for your next top up of hot water. Considerate, and a nice touch to the homey feel of this little place.  There aren't too many Japanese places in the city that have a patio. Konnichiwa does. Although you do end up inhaling the strong flavours of hearty Italian pizza at John's Italian next door while waiting for your raw fish to appear, (which can be confusing), it all ends up being part of the melting pot experience of this little stretch of Baldwin Street. Worth checking out if you're looking for some decent sushi past the couple of all-you-can-eat places nearby."}
{"text":"We always have a weird eating schedule on weekends, after brunch, you get hungry around 2-3pm, but it is also a time when many restaurants close for the afternoon in preparation of the dinner rush. There are a lot of Japanese restaurants in Baldwin area, and since it is a nice sunny day, many people are out in the patio. We decided to try Konnichiwa. They were open for another hour before they close for the afternoon.  I got the chirashi don, it's the first time I had it since back from Japan. There was a wide variety of fresh sashimi. Of course, it is not as fresh from the ones in Japan but it is comparable. We also got the soba noodles with tempera and sushi set lunch special. It was pretty good, I like their soup base. The food was pretty good, it is not cheap but compared to other high name Japanese restaurant in downtown, it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've been going here for aeons (back in the 90s) when their tofu donburi was only 10 bucks! It's a bit more expensive now but I think it's purely inflation adjusted. I still come here for the donburi and haven't really had anything else. A big simple bowl of rice with stuff on top (they have good vegetarian options esp. the tofu donburi) and a green tea. Done and done.   Plus the space is cosy, the front sign hasn't changed in a long time (a comforting sight), and it's located on Baldwin Street which is one of the best hidden local spots to find lots of good food on one tiny street away from the traffic."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday lunch. My last visit was three years ago.   Ordered: 1. Shirmp & Veggie tempura Udon  This was the most saltiest udon broth I've ever had! To the point that after sipping just three spoons, I can feel my lips wrinkling and my throat drying!  Tempura was not crispy at all, probably the frying temperature was not high enough, resulting all the veggies were soggy and oily. Even an ayce sushi does better.   The udon noodle itself was not chewy, it tasted like over cooked dumpling skin. So soggy that almost every time I've tried picking it up, the noodle just breaks off, which never happens to any other Udons i've had at other places.   2. Sashimi lunch   Just not fresh at all. Salmon quality is like the ones you get in Costco that have been left there for few days.   Overall, I don't understand how the 4 stars came from. I'm not asking much, just expected for the price it should at least be a bit better then ayce sushi or maybe even those sushi chain restaurants.  The good side is, decor was very cute with all the chalk board drawings, and the server was very attentive and nice as well."}
{"text":"Good authentic Japanese food actually made and served by Japanese chef; I just made the mistake of coming here for lunch on a Friday... The place was absolutely packed, and the wait staff was literally running to get their customers served. My lunch came but without my salad, soup, or even a cup of water. However, my waitress quickly noticed and provided the rest of my lunch with some apologies. So, aside from a small mishap, the lunch was filling. I had the sushi lunch combo, and the fish tasted fresh, though I was a bit taken aback by the size of it... Not that I'm complaining, but the sushi I had in Japan were smaller and more, for a lack of a better word, delicate. Perhaps they tweaked it a little to suit the North American taste/perception? In short, I definitely recommend this place for some good food, but just don't come during peak times!"}
{"text":"This is the hottest Japanese place on Baldwin street, and I mean that literally.  The patio might be nice on a warm day, but our large group had to sweat it out indoors.  Fortunately the staff were kind enough to bring crushed ice to the table while we got our order.    I had a grilled mackerel and a side of sushi, and it was a filling and tasty meal.  Others had various combos that were on offer.  Will come back to chill on another day at the patio."}
{"text":"Konnichiwa is a tiny Japanese place on Baldwin st.  It is nice and cozy with around 8 tables only so it can get packed easily on a busy night.  We were seated at the window table where the table was super tiny and could only fit 2 bowls. We had the ramen here which is good but the soup base was best part which had this sweet and spiciness kick to it.  Quality is very good, I think they make their own noodles in house.  Pricing is on the higher end but I think it was worth it.  Konnichiwa is nicely decorated with Japanese theme from posters to art on the wall.  Service was pretty good and the servers were very polite as well.  Overall, Konnichiwa is a great small authentic Japanese restaurant that provides high quality food.    Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  3/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"The food was decent - good sized spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll lunch special - except for the salad which was tasteless. The service was terrible and very slow. My friends did not even get any tempura sauce and were told to use soy sauce instead."}
{"text":"- went again a couple of nights ago to a packed dining room - had the katsu curry rice (about $15?)... which was kind of overpriced in my opinion.  - it was really good when it comes to japanese curries go (it has a little bit of heat to it), but i think i'd rather hit up tokyo kitchen instead."}
{"text":"i've been looking for a place downtown that has decent ramen and this place will be my go-to for my ramen craving. I had the miso-based ramen  with deep-fried tofu and vegetables. very tasty (although a tiny bit salty). my friend had the sushi and said it wasn't that great. i think they're strength lies in the noodles. now, if only there was a place downtown where they  make their noodles fresh!"}
{"text":"How have I missed this place? In fact, how have I missed that there is some kind of Japanese/noodle nexus on Baldwin Street? No matter - I guess it's a nice problem to have; too many wonderful choices within that block.  This one definitely is high on my favourite list now. Konnichiwa is unpretentious, friendly and delivers on its promise of Japanese comfort food. My experience of their teriyaki is now going to make it impossible for me to enjoy it anywhere else - seriously, the most flavourful one I've ever had. Sushi and sashimi are fresh and wonderful. And it seems it is possible to do all this without a lot of over the top restaurant theatre. That said, if you're in the mood for some over the top restaurant theatre, there are lots of other decent places to go. If you're just looking for some Japanese yummy, I highly recommend this place. And you get all of that without emptying your wallet."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my lab which is located on campus. Takes about 10 min to walk here. When we got in around 12:30 on a weekday it was packed. Luckily there was a table for us. I got the tonkatsu ramen with pork. The soup was salty but tasty and pork was tender and sweet. Someone ordered hot soba noodle with tempura and the waitress kindly pointed out that there was a lunch special that serves the same thing for the same price but includes avacado rolls. It took a bit of time for all the orders to arrive but everyone quickly devoured their meal. A nice and cozy place for lunch~"}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto! Every thing from the street it's on (Baldwin) to the super friendly staff that are Japanese and the food that reminds me of Japan!  I love all of their food, nothing in particular, I do often get the ramen, the grilled squid is really good, the gyoza is really good as well! Home made, never frozen and they put the vinegar/ soy sauce on it for you!   My mother on the other hand has gotten the same dish every thing since we started going here about 4 years ago! She swears by their grilled salmon! She loves their cut of fish, all they do it put a little salt on it grill it with some steamed vegetables and rice!   We often drive from uptown all the way just to eat here and go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times. The food is always great and the service is generally polite and efficient.   I recommend the Pho - noodles and miso or garlic broth with a ton of fresh veggies and egg. It's fantastic on a cold day."}
{"text":"Came across this place on a Thursday evening. Small store and was lucky to get a table for 3 people. Great tasting ramen (perfect for a cooler day). Had the tonkotsu with pork and it was the perfect size. Service was exceptionally slow...so not somewhere you want to go if you're in a rush!"}
{"text":"Really decent Japanese food! We were the first ones there at exactly 1130AM when they opened. Though we were a group of 6, they were able to accommodate us in the small space by combining tables. I would definitely recommend that any groups bigger than 4 people should do advance reservations if possible.  The food took a bit to get to us, but the wait was worth it! I had a sushi bento box that was beautifully put together and everything was so fresh. Everyone else had really amazing looking bentos as well. There was quite a quantity of food and we all left extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"i travel once a week to go here just for the authentic jap food, never a wait, small quaint little place, good selection of food and good quality, -1 for service, i come so often and they don't recognize me and always stuff me the dessert menu in the middle of my conversation"}
{"text":"Great apps. Server doesn't really have good English though so that could be frustrating. Prices on the higher side but dishes are unique."}
{"text":"Excellent Raman & sushi.  Small seating area, reminiscent of Asia-town in Queens, N.Y..  The Japanese proprietors are friendly and efficient.  We will come back again."}
{"text":"Really nice date spot but steep pricing.  Good for celebratory dinners with a close friend, not good for group settings as the place is quite small and the tables not very accommodating for large parties."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a lunch date at Konnichiwa for 11:45am because we both wanted to beat the lunch rush. The restaurant does not have many dining tables, so if you want to be seated inside, you'll have to arrive earlier.  We both chose to order the Chirashi that was written on the chalkboard - there is no price listed and it was not written in the menu.  The Chirashi don arrived in a cute little black Japanese lacquered box and was filled with fresh scallops, mackerel, ika, salmon, tuna, tako, tamago, ebi, arctic surf calms, kani and topped with a shiso leaf.  The fish was very fresh and you can taste the \"Ocean\" sweetness.  The bed of sushi rice was perfectly seasoned and.  The Chirashi don cost $25 plus tax and tip per person, so lunch ended up being just a little under $34 which is quite steep from my perspective.  Hence, the 3 star review."}
{"text":"Five us came in for lunch on a weekday.  We all left with full bellies and happy thoughts.  I ordered the bento box lunch special with sushi as the main component.  I got a bowl of miso, a good serving of salad and plenty of sushi, rice and a few pieces of vegetable tempura.  Everything tasted fresh and seemed to be of high quality.  There's plenty of competition for lunch traffic on this street.  We were steered here by the high Yelp reviews and apparently made the right choice."}
{"text":"I had to visit again. Again, a great experience. A friend and I shared the spicy salmon roll which was fresh and delicious; my friend thoroughly enjoyed her tempura don; and I ordered the blue mackerel which came grilled, the skin was crispy and salty and amazing while the flesh was juicy and tender. It came with steamed veg. Most of it was just straight up steamed, except the carrots which were boiled in something flavourful.  Service was kind and discreet. The restaurant was busy but food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Disappointed because I was very excited to eat authentic Japanese food but turned out my chirashi don ($25) had IMITATION CRAB MEAT and they were very sly about it and put it behind the mint leaf. But overall, the sushi was very good. My friend ordered the salmon ikura don and it was very very good. So guys don't order the chirashi don if you don't like eating imitation crab meat"}
{"text":"KONNICHIWA  INT. RESTAURANT -DINING ROOM  WE SEE: A girl and a boy seated a wooden table right by the window. It is night time, pitch black outside with snowflakes gently falling. The girl is seated against the wall and across from the boy. They quietly examine the menu as the elderly waitress put down 2 cups of hot tea the pair had ordered.  CLOSE ON. The two steaming cups of hot korean tea, sans tea bag (meaning it's loose leaf). It is incredibly cold outside.   CUT TO:  WE SEE. The pair orders their meals from the waitress who then turns and returns to the kitchen. The boy is seated upright, his head is up, he looks straight ahead as he reaches for his tea. The girl, slightly slouched, her head is down as she gazes at her tea. Their silence matches the quietness and dim interior of the restaurant.   CUT TO: WE SEE. Their meals arrive. The boy's order of a Japanese beef dish with a side of white rice is placed in front of him. The girl's order of soba soup noodles with vegetable tempura on a side dish is placed in front of her.   WE SEE. The pair consumes their meals in near silence. Conversation is sparse.   CLOSE ON. The girl's soba broth noodle soup. Thin greyish Japanese noodles with seaweed in a Japanese broth soup. It is a fair portion for ~$9.00. The broth is steaming hot, perfect for the cold winter night.   CLOSE ON. The vegetable tempura pieces. Lightly battered and fried, there is also a fair amount of vegetable on the side plate that accompanied the bowl of noodles. The tempura is crispy and hot, not overly fried but fried with the utmost care.   BACK TO:  WE SEE. The girl and the boy enjoying their delicious and hot dinner in a quaint little Japanese restaurant at the table by the window on a cold winter night.  FADE TO BLACK.  FIN."}
{"text":"This is possibly the cutest stop on Baldwin Village. Very cosy and intimate with great looking decorations all around and friendly staff.  But big time 3 stars for costing way too much.   You get a $13 piece sushi set for almost $19 on top of which they charge you $0.85 plus tax for green tea (comes with the bag) and lack complimentary ice cream or fruit at the end, none of which sat well for me. Yes the food is good, but with \"etsu\"just a stones throw away I say the nice folk here need to up their game if they want to be the best sushi place on the block.   I also had their ramen which for $8.95 is a great deal since they know how to get their ramen done (although I've yet to come across a place with very authentic ramen in Toronto), but overall a menu that can come across as lacking/confusing and high prices puts this place on second or third place for sushi on Baldwin.   Although if you're looking for a date spot on Baldwin, Konnichiwa is your best bet apart from the more high end Bodega and Bocca."}
{"text":"We had soba soup and ramen... Fabulous!  Not too salty and plenty of flavour... Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came back here last night after a year hiatus (too lazy to walk to Baldwin village most nights ;) ). They are still kicking out homey authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"this place is really romantic and the ambiance is quiet, but relaxed. Their decor is amazing, especially the hand-drawn menus. would highly recommend for a date or casual dining.  The food was pretty good, the bento box is definitely the best on the menu. You get a lot of food that is very good quality (the salad has great sauce, the california rolls have a lot of fish eggs and the salmon is good as well)."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place!!! Authentic and has been around for a while. Love the Nabe udon."}
{"text":"Konnichiwa is my little ramen secret. This tiny Japanese restaurant is burrowed right in the middle of Baldwin Village. Japanese run and Japanese owned, this place has the right atmosphere, pricing and quality to keep me a happy returning customer.  My favourite thing to order at Konnichiwa is always, always the ramen. On my most recent trip, I had the pork bone ramen with, you guessed it, pork. It came out nice and hot but not steaming, the pork was so well cooked it kept falling off my chopsticks. It's everything you could want on a chilly Toronto evening. They offer a variety of sake as well, if you feel like imbibing.   My favourite ambient part of the restaurant is how when you walk to the bathroom, you can smell the rice cooking in the giant rice cooker. The smell of rice vinegar is just another authentic part of the experience. I've never had a bad time here!"}
{"text":"I came here after some long run of hospital food. So you'd think my judgement maybe clouded. Trust me it tis not. I take my jap VERY seriously!  The restaurant itself is small and what can be assumed as family owned and perhaps run.  There appeared to be a total of 4 staff.  2 servers, the sushi chef and a cook. Maybe a dishwasher, but hey that could also just be a machine as we noticed some of the dishes didn't look so pretty. Big no no for me when it comes to a Japanese restaurant own and run my Japanese.  The plating and dishes are usually kept in decent if not spectacular conditions. Not dishwasher run down.  When we walked in around 1130ish there were 2 other tables there before us, so climate control was alright. Once the lunch hour hit the rush made the little restaurant very very warm on what was already a warm summer day. They did in the end turn on the ceiling fan making it more bare able.   Now comes my rant on the food. Which I must say is where all 3 stars come from.  I start with the simplest - miso soup.  A few sips in and you could taste the bonito and seafood. The white miso wasn't over powering nor  to salty making it one of THE most amazing miso soups I've ever had.  I find in the simplest of dishes is where you'll find the quality of the restaurant and chef.  The sushi/sashimi was amazingly fresh. I ordered the ikura donburi while my lunch date ordered the chirashi don. Ikura (salmon roe/eggs) are salty and fishy when not fresh. These where sweet and not so \"fishy\". Same could me said about mackerel but the ones in the chirashi where tasty without that day old fish taste.   The reason for the 2 lost stars service was a bit slow as there was only 2 of them I can understand.  Second the menu didn't really give you much to choose from. Mainly consisting of bentos. So for those of us who didn't order those it was a bit slower. I could see them trying their best to go order by order. Not to mention the stacks of bento boxes in front of the sushi chef."}
{"text":"Very nice place for lunch. Casual yet stylish little place on Baldwin. Portions can feel small depending on what you end up ordering. Sashimi is really fresh. I recommend the bento box or any of the combos!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to take your parents to if you want to impress them ;)   The vibe is super cute and cozy, and the food is awesome. You can't go wrong with Konnichiwa. I've been there twice and have tried the churashi as well as the chicken katsu. My mom got the bento box dinner, which seems to be the best deal: rice, teriyaki salmon, makis, edamame, and tempura veggies. I'm definitely going back and getting that next time."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with a group of 9. We had called a few minutes ahead of time to reserve a table and we were able to sit inside.  FOOD:  I ordered the spicy sushi plate that came with 6 pieces each of spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll. It also came with salad and miso soup. The sushi was great, and the fish tasted fresh. The serving size was just perfect for a workday lunch. Some of my coworkers got bento boxes and one got sashimi lunch. My friend said the sashimi tasted very fresh and everyone enjoyed their food.  SERVICE: I would have to say their service is on the slow side. It could be due to the busy lunch hour but food takes 15-20 minutes to arrive. So be prepared for that. Besides that their service is decent.  DÉCOR: I have to say something about their amazing chalk art. Whoever is drawing them is a true artist! Take a look around at the cute and funny chalk drawings around the restaurant to keep you entertained!  Would recommend for lunch since the prices are affordable for decent sushi. Although personally I think Etsu (just a few doors down) has better food, this place is slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"The scale of this restaurant made it feel like a Cafe as we came at a time more suitable for Konbanwa than Konnichiwa. We sat next to the window space for 2 with a table circumference that's just enough to fit 2 Bento meals and not much more. That specific spot was very cozy I will wish to get that same spot the next time. MY spot!   Tofu on Shoyu Broth Ramen($8.95) has a broth with a hint of sweetness almost like how Mire Poix brings a sweetness to any protein stock. It is unexpected as most people's image of Shoyu provides an Umami addiction, so the first sip of this broth brings a new territory to your mind.   The Ramen Noodles were A-OK as an accompanying fellow yelper was quick to point out that it's reminiscent of packaged Instant Noodle with a rinse in-between boiling with water, then simmer in broth. It has that Wrinkled style which is great for slurping the broth all over your neighbour. :P   Pork on Miso Broth Ramen($8.95) uses the Dark Brown Miso that we fought over as Ramen is naturally identified with this Umami taste. The Pork slices were good when I know other places can feed you some inferior product and not even be embarrassed. Only if Konnichiwa had TONKOTSU, then I would be more pleased then Niwatei."}
{"text":"I really like this place. This japanese restaurant is nice and cozy.  I really enjoy the ambience - it a small restaurant but it give you a nice cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It is also not noisy,  great place for dinner. The food quality was really good too. All the ingredients were fresh. The servers were friendly and attentive. I would definitely continue to come here to satisfy my japanese food cravings."}
{"text":"The food here is good but I have to share that I have had bad service here for large groups not once but TWICE. And after several bad experiences, I just cannot get over the poor service.   We recently made reservations for a Friday lunch and spent WAY too much time waiting on our server for every aspect of our visit, from receiving water, to putting in our order, to receiving the food. It was pretty annoying to see the last people who arrived to the lunch receive their food first. The waitresses are incredibly slow and it didn't help that the owner (?) stood at the counter almost the entire time calculating bills rather than helping to get the orders in or the food out.   Paying was another long, arduous process and i have to say, by the end of it... the food just didn't make all the waiting and frustration worth it. I'd like to come back but I just don't know if I could bring myself to do it."}
{"text":"lots of good memories at this restaurant. the decoration is very original, lots of arts on the wall from japan. the restaurant was run by a family, the waitress is alway in a kimono and bow to everyone when she speaks. i thought it's super cute. food was good, not amazing but the atmosphere was def awesome."}
{"text":"mmm...sushi. Ever since i watched the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi i cannot get it off my mind.  I came to Konnichiwa for Saturday lunch. I really like the ambience, its a smaller sized sushi shop with comfortable chairs and little bench spots with cusions. A relaxing place. We got to sit right by the big windows and enjoy a nice view.  Food itself was great. They serve lunch specials on weekends. I had tuna and salmon rolls-12 maki pieces that had big chunks of fresh tuna and salmon.The quality of sushi was better than average. For $10 you can't go wrong.   I'll come back. For sure."}
{"text":"Very authentic place, in the small suburban neighbourhoods with a few restaurants around and shops. (Located on Baldwin St.) really close to Chinatown and the Ontario Museum   I love that the place is small and cozy.  There is a kimono on the wall, the seats are all in wood and the cutlery and bowls are all similar to what you would get in Japan.  The service is good, very nice.  You do have to pay for green tea if you order it.   1. Udon Noodle 8/10. soup base was nice, the noodles were chewy and not over cooked at all.  The chicken in it was boiled, which it was fried and then put on top. There wasn't a ton of veggies, just some julienned carrots & bean sprouts I think  2. Yellow Tail Roll.  The fish was fresh, rice was seasoned nicely and the size cut was good. I felt there was a bit too much rice.  3. Dynamite Roll.  The shrimp was very fresh.  The rice is seasoned nicely as well. Good taste with a bit of avocado and cucumber.   3. Oyako Don 7/10.  The taste was a bit bland.  The Dashi or Soy Seasoning wasn't enough.  The rice was cooked nicely.  The Chicken was just cooke as usual.  The egg was mixed through the rice and half cooked, so really creamy and slimey.   Someone else had ramen and that looked so good.  The owners seemed very  nice.  The prices were a bit higher, but they had other items on the menu good for vegetarians and seemed more authentic than most places.  Definitely would come here again!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The place is owned and run by Japanese people and the food is delicious and authentic! The waitresses are very friendly and they even give you tea with individual teabags (Whoaaaa! - I thought that was really cute haha). One of my favourite Japanese restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"A friend turned me on to the mackerel. It comes with flavourful miso soup, delish veggies and the most perfect little bowl of rice. 9 or 10 dollars!   The fish. Be warned this IS crack fish and you WILL get addicted. I fear I smell fishy for the rest of the day but I don't even care. I went today and they were closed. I nearly wept"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers, they are located on one of my favourite streets. I was able to make a last minute reservation which is nice since it is a busy area. I got the veggie bento box, which was really good. The tempura was so delicious, the oil used tasted clean and light. The rolls that came in it were perfect and the tofu was delicious and prepared in a unique way. I don't know that my friends enjoyed in quite as much with their fish sushi, but my stuff was great and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"High quality food. Worth the price. I come here often at lunch time, spicy salmon with tempura is my favourite. Their Ramen is also surprisingly good, arguably better than the two nearby Ramen restaurants."}
{"text":"My friend says this is one of the best ramen places she's been to. And it's one of her favorite meals in Toronto.  With such high regard, I had to get the ramen here, even though they offer other items like rice bowls and sushi.  All the staff here are so sweet, and this place is truly authentic.  I don't think I was blown away since I compared the ramen here to those in Little Tokyo back in California but it's certainly not bad.  Rich and loaded with toppings, this bowl is certainly hearty and filling but it's also very rich and flavorful. A heads up that you'll be gulping down lots of water for all this flavor - but flavor is delicious."}
{"text":"A great small authentic Japanese restaurant with a small menu. Everyone that works there is Japanese and their chefs apparently used to work for the Prince Hotel.   They are reasonably priced and have greaat udon/sobu that I really liked. Once patio season comes along, this place gets full fast as do most places on Baldwin street but overall a nice little place to have lunch if you're in the area and don't want to spend too much money on food!"}
{"text":"I have the sukiyaki, broth was delicious, chef was not dingy on beef, presentation is very nice. Service is nice, enough staff to go around on a wed nighf"}
{"text":"Popped into Konnichiwa on a Tuesday evening, and thankfully it wasn't overly busy.  They have tables outside, and an equal amount of seating inside as well.  I decided to eat inside.  I arrived and I was immediately greeted and shown to a table.  I ordered a green tea and some water and in no time those were placed in front of me.  I decided to go with a Spicy Salmon roll, Calif. roll, and an avocado roll.  Being my first visit, I like to see how they do with some very standard types of rolls.    I had decided to get some edamame as well to snack on, and those were served up hot in no time.  The edamame was good, but the beans looked like they were either freezer burned or rejects.  Most of them were not in good shape.  Shortly there after came my rolls.  The rolls were good, but I have one major complaint.  Use the more expensive nori !  having chewy nori is just such a let down when you have good rolls.  The rolls were good, fresh and flavourful, but again, when you have to try and tear apart the rolls with your teeth because the nori is chewy... ugh !    The place wasn't overly busy, but regardless the servers were very quick with refilling water and tea.    Overall, it's good food, but again they need to use better quality nori (IMO).  Service was excellent and definitely brought the rating up from a 3 to a 4 star.  Actually it's a solid 3.5 star place.  Food was good, not fabulous, but good and service was very good.  I'll go back and try some of the other dishes, the Katsu looked pretty good and smelled good as a few of those plates went past me."}
{"text":"Finding this place is a little bit of a chore.  It's tucked away in the middle of china town, and it's on a tiny strip on Baldwin.  It's a tiny little restaurant that probably sits around 30 people max and serves japanese food from ramen to sushi.  Personally I only came here with one thing in mind, ramen.  I figured I go here and see what everyone was talking about.  I had pre-read reviews in advance so I could get the best experience I could.  I was advised to order the pork with miso soup base so I decided to do just that.  Personally I found the soup base too sweet.  I know it's supposed to be a little sweet, but I actually found it overbearing.  I quickly afterwards doused it with a whole bunch of chili powder (cause I like it hot).    The pork however was pretty nice.  It was tender, but not too fatty, so I actually kinda liked it.  The noodles were a nice consistency, nothing too mind blowing.  I also got the Gyoza there (cause I like dumplings).  I found them kinda soft and needed to be more crispy on the outside.  Meh, wish they were more crispy.  Note that they do charge for tea.  They give you a tea bag, so I do understand why they charge.  Most people would assume it's free, but just a heads up they charge 90 cents for tea bags =/.  As a whole, I wouldn't say that this place is one of the best for ramen in the city.  You can probably do better."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to have dinner with a friend. We were lucky and were able to get a table without waiting. It's a small restaurant, I would recommend reservations. We ordered their supreme sashimi set, mixed sashimi and sushi set, seaweed salads and miso soup. The sushi was good, not too much rice and their grilled eel was divine. I actually ordered four more because there was not enough in supreme set. My favorite part of the meal! The sashimi was fresh, plating was done well and everything tasted delicious. Their servers were warm and friendly as well. A great choice on Baldwin Street!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great sushi place!!! One of the best sushi places that I've ever been to. The fish were really fresh, price was reasonable, and service was great!!! I ordered the dinner sushi + sashimi combo. Delicious!!!! :)"}
{"text":"*3.5 STARS  They must've changed management.  I refused to go here for quite some time, but now all my coworkers come here for lunch quite often.  So I finally gave in and went back.  Like whoa.  Total 180.  I still haven't had sushi there, but the ramen there was pretty good (but not as good as Kinton Ramen down the street).  I had the miso ramen with pork.  It was pretty good.  Lovely little place.  Much better service than before."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch, but it is truly a great find.  The lunch bento box is really worth it. It has sushi, tempura, teriyake and miso soup.  The fish is always fresh, and the service is speedy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to dine at Konnichiwa for a long time (since I was a kid, for at least ten years now). It has changed slowly over time, but the dining experience has remained true to how it was when I was a youngster. I came here with a friend recently just before they wrapped up lunch service. (They close for a couple hours before reopening for dinner.) I ordered the soba noodle soup with shrimp and vegetable tempura on the side. I've been getting this dish for years and it hasn't changed at all (that's a good thing). So delicious and comforting on a cold winter day. My friend ordered the chirashi. I snuck a piece of squid.. it was delicious and I don't normally even like squid. The highlight of the meal was definitely the sushi we ordered. (two pieces inari, two pieces uni). The inari was great and they were HUUUGE. But the uni.. best uni I've ever had, to be honest. So creamy and sweet, not a hint of bitterness. I wish I could have some right now. If you're on Baldwin, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Cute little place and I like the decor however food took forever to arrive. If you are around the area and want some decent sushi this might be an option for you - light and healthy but to be honest I have had better sushi for the price I paid"}
{"text":"We thought we'd tried all the restaurants on Baldwin until we saw the beautiful Konniciwa with the sign advertising sukiyaki. We ordered the scallops fried in butter and soy, sukiyaki, eel hot pot, and chicken curry. The scallop appetizer was amazing and something I'll try to duplicate at home. The eel and sukiyaki were both very good. The sweetness of the sukiyaki will keep us coming back. The curry was good, but is better at Kaiju. Although, the accompanying vegetables that went with the curry were better than the coleslaw that's served at Kaiju.   We really liked the decor and atmosphere of the place. It seemed very authentic and the menu was more than just sushi. The sushi was good as we also ordered a dynamite roll to go."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend last night. Simple, legitimate Japanese food (no mayo -fusion-dragon rolls here).  Was craving tonkatsu, so I got the Katsu donburi, and it was well done. My friend got the tonkotsu ramen (the hearty pork stock ramen that is ubiquitious in Japan) and I must say it was like I was back in Kagoshima all over again! Although my friend didn't listen to me and failed to slurp the ramen and thus eat it the way the food gods intended!  Simple is best."}
{"text":"So, I had been in \"The Great White North\" for about 2 1/2 weeks, and I was getting discouraged by the food selection. I had been told (by my boyfriend, who thinks he comes from the greatest city around... Toronto) that the food was amazing.  Toronto's offerings seemed to include Korean, Korean-owned Chinese, Korean-owned Vietnamese, Korean-owned Indian, Korean-owned American, and Korean-owned Japanese. Not that it's an awful thing that the Koreans have monopolized the dining scene, but I don't necessarily want to see Kalbi and Bulgogi on a menu next to Burgers or a sushi menu. Just because a place does one type of Asian food well, does not mean it does them all well, in fact, quite the opposite seems true.  After that long rant, here is my review: Konnichiwa is a diamond in the rough, located on adorable Baldwin Street, which is adorned with quaint patios, rustic signs, and tucked away on what otherwise looks like a small residential road. I love Udon, and up until I walked into this adorably decorated, small but clean haven, I had felt like all Toronto had to offer was noodles in semi-flavored water... Konnichiwa's Udon had the perfect ingredients! The tempura, although a somewhat smaller portion than I'd like, was crispy and cooked just right. My boyfriend's ramen was amazing, the garlic in the soup, although not particularly authentic, was surprisingly tasty... One of the best I've ever tasted. We had the dynamite rolls, which were fresh and the perfect size. We even had to place a second order of Gyoza at the end of our meal because they were so amazingly good!  I suggest that if you want to try Japanese the way Japanese was meant to be eaten, Konnichiwa is your best bet in Toronto!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Konnichiwa was a very interesting Japanese restaurant that I would not have stepped inside without searching Yelp at first.  I believe this place recently moved across the street, as there were two Konnichiwas on Baldwin, but one of them was vacant. Either way, the restaurant is on the north side now, and it has that nice cozy feel to it. However, reservations are pretty much required especially if you're reserving on a weekend, as walk-ins will be turned away.  This place has a decent variety of Japanese foods (including a lot of tapas options and hot food options), though I mainly focused on the lunch special. I had the sushi lunch special, which consisted of about 8 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of rolls.  While many sushi restaurants nowadays go crazy with aburi style sushi, this place still lays it the traditional way, without the pizzazz. The fish is very fresh, delicious, and it didn't even needed to be seared to get that flavour! If you still like your sushi with the basic fish and without all the eye candy, this is definitely the place for you.  Service was excellent and we were attended to the entire time. It may be a small restaurant, but sometimes these places are where you get some of the best, traditional food, and it was definitely the case here!"}
{"text":"Ever since Guu stopped selling their clear-broth sweet shoyu ramen, I have been searching all over the city for my Tokyo-style ramen fix.   AND I FINALLY FOUND IT!  Konnichiwa's Shoyu Ramen. It's $10.95, with your protein choice of Beef, Chicken, Pork or Tofu. Everything about this ramen was perfect and delicious. I tried the Beef, but I will go back and try the other 3 options. It's the broth and the noodles that really make this dish."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere on Baldwin Street; there are a lot of uni students walking around so it makes me feel less old ...   Anyway, dropped in to Konnichiwa for lunch today. This place is owned and run by Japanese people - the head chef is experienced in his field so no 'faux Japanese' here.   It was pretty crowded for a Monday afternoon. This place is small, but it has a small patio. Hot day + garbage = baaaaad so we were lucky to snag a table inside. I had the spicy chicken and dynamite roll. For $12, it's quite reasonable. In addition to the main, I got miso soup and a salad (with wakame!). Food items are your typical mom & pop Japanese good, which I like. Service was good in spite of how busy they were.  Good for: lunch, Japanese food craving"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! I found this through your \"affordable Japanese\" in an area that is not super touristy.  Great spot. The people are super genuine.  And the food, delicious!  Order many little things. And the grilled shiitake mushroom.   Bustle scallops, black cod!  Their ginger is so fresh."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place considering the owners are Japanese and have worked in the food industry in Japan for many years. Anyhow, you can find this little restaurant on Baldwin where there are other small boutique like restaurants. The restaurant is quite small and cannot fit many people but definitely bigger than Japango. The waitresses are nice here and the service is decent. Their menu is very creative I must say, but it creates problems for comprehension. Each item on the menu is written in a different font and it's written in those creative design fonts you would find online. It made it longer for me to decide what to eat because I was too busy understanding the menu. Anyhow, I got a miso garlic ramen and some nigiri rolls: yellow tail and red tuna, dynamite roll, and spider roll. The ramen is definitely overhyped. It's alright but it was not bad. But I wouldn't order the ramen again. The broth was weak but the pork was cooked right. The nigiri rolls were not that fresh and the rice kept breaking apart. The dynamite roll was the biggest rip off. It was all rice with so little ingredients. The spider roll was better but it still had too much rice. If you like rolls with 90% rice, then this place is right for you.   But anyway, I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant anytime soon since it didn't WOW me. The restaurant was very mediocre. There are way better Japanese restaurants in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I always end up here when I'm in the area. It's perfect for lunch -- cozy, good value, friendly service, consistently delicious, and pretty fast (you can make it, even if you only have 1 hour for lunch). The lunch combos are a great deal and come with miso soup and salad. Bonus points for having actual mixed greens, and not just colourless iceberg lettuce. The sushi is always very fresh. I have also tried their ramen and gyoza which are also quite good! (not as many choices as Ryus and Kinton next door, but quite respectable).   There are not that many tables, so I would not come here with a group bigger than 4 people. The patio in the summer is pretty nice though."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner and enjoyed this restaurant. It was a cute little place but nicely setup.  It was not crowded but the waitress was a bit distracted having conversations among themselves - and hard to waved them down.   The food was good but nothing very memorable.   I would go back soon - I think."}
{"text":"Fish is super fresh and their bonito broth is also super tasty, I haven't had better soba/udon in Toronto. Almost everything I've tried on the menu is fantastic (especially their curry, which is apparently home-made). Service is also attentive, sometimes they take the time to describe the dish and tell you how to eat it if it's a bit complicated.  Their grilled fish is generaly really good (especially the blue mackerel filet), but I avoid the atlantic salmon shioyaki since they have a tendency to burn it a little bit. Maybe it's supposed to be that way, maybe not; either way, it's not really to my taste. Service can also be a little slow when the restaurant gets super busy, I wouldn't go during peak hours unless you can actually look inside to see how busy it is.  Overall this is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Some of the best Japanese food I've had was from this beast of a restaurant. Put aside the craving for sushi and try something else for a change. The Gyoza dumplings, hokkaido hoke, grilled mackerel, and katsu don  should be given a chance upon your visit to this gem. Or order something off the chalkboard menu. I'll be going back to konnichiwa very soon."}
{"text":"konnichiwa seems to have everything - ramen, sushi and a variety of other japanese dishes.   their ramen and sushi are indeed very good, but you can get very good ramen and sushi elsewhere in toronto. imho, they distinguish themselves with the other japanese dishes that they offer.   the space is cozy, but nicely decorated. the service is typical japanese, that is, over the top friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Japanese places downtown. Food and service never disappoints. Sitting on the patio during summer is also quite nice. Even though they are not known for this, their ramen is one of the best in the city. I have tried a looooot of ramen. Their sushi is always fresh and nicely rolled too. Recently, I had their \"slurp and roll\" (I think that's the name) combo for dinner. I was STUFFED. This came with hot udon and dipping sauce on the side, small veggie tempura basket, and 6 pieces of spicy sushi. Delicious!!! Not bad for $20, considering the authenticity and location! I definitely recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Would not go back here again. Extremely overpriced for the portion sizes, selection, and taste."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend (her choice).  Reading all the reviews now, I wish I would have ordered the ramen.  Service was slow albeit a large group of 15 dominated one half of the small space.  It took several attempts to get our waitress' attention for ordering.  We decided to get a couple of standard rolls to share - spicy salmon ($8.95), dynamite ($8.95) and spider roll ($13.95).  Appetizers were edamame ($4) and tempura shrimp/veggies ($8.95).  Plus a couple of glasses of pinot (8.95).  The edamame and tempura came first...both just average.  Then we received the salmon and dynamite rolls, again just average.  There was a pretty long wait for the spider roll but I was pleasantly surprised that it contained real soft shell crab and not the fake stuff.  The food was meh, the service was slow, pricing a bit higher than necessary and nothing really luring me back to this place."}
{"text":"Really good bang for your buck! We got the don's (bowl of rice with meat/veggies on top) that were all around $10.  The place itself is easy to walk past and is located along the strip of restaurants around there.  Good place to go if you're not in the mood for ramen and like the atmosphere of a family-owned restaurant with great service.   Food overall was good, no complaints but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years already and it's always a favourite. This is a cozy, quiet restaurant that has the look of a wood framed Japanese room with memorabilia and cute chalkboard menus along its walls - dinner service has dim ambient lighting. It's quite small so reservations are recommended.   Rather than sushi or the typical fare, I highly recommend their home-style Japanese food, which is harder to find at other restaurants. They may be milder in taste for some but I like it this way as I find it closer to my mom's cooking. Here are my go-to's: - Salmon Shioyaki // Black Cod Filet: the grilled fish here is nicely cooked to the right texture and is seasoned/marinated well.  - Nabeyaki Udon: the noodles are springy and comes with tempura that is crispy, lightly-battered, and has almost no grease. It comes with a good amount of veggies in a light but flavourful broth, and of course it's topped with an egg!  They revamped their menu with an eclectic mix of fonts which is hard to read but don't let that deter you. The staff are friendly and attentive - tea is constantly being refilled without asking!"}
{"text":"Konnichiwa is an authentic Japanese restaurant conveniently located in the heart of Baldwin Village. I admire the quality of ingredients they use. It shows in how their food tastes. Their Tonkatsu Donburi is one of the best IMHO, only to be matched by Japango on Elizabeth St or Donburi in Markham (505 Highway 7).  My only gripe with Konnichiwa is how expensive they are. Their pricing in on the higher end, but I suppose quality stuff costs $$. I've only tried their Tonkatsu Donburi and Tonkatsu Ramen, so it's hard for me to pass any judgment on other items on the menu. Judging from the pictures on Yelp, the other stuff is just as delicious. I mean, just look at how fresh their sashimi looks like. It's like the Chef just returned from a port market."}
{"text":"Ramen? Mediocre. Appetizers? Meh. Unagi rice? Mom can make better.  BUT THE SESAME ICE CREAM? MADNESS. Hands down the best ice cream I've ever had in my life. It was rich and flavorful and perfectly creamy. Sugary but not too sweet. And oh, let me tell you, it was BLACK. But damn, that was the best tasting black goop I've ever had. Ever since visiting here, I've had constant cravings for this sinfully scrumptious dessert."}
{"text":"A GREAT Japanese restaurant! Food is fresh and their bento boxes are out of this world. It's definitely a great place to have lunch! Their bento boxes are huge and they're only 15 bucks! A must try if you're in the area for lunch!  Service and Environment It's quite a smaller than average restaurant and the restaurant can get pretty busy during lunch especially around noon. However the wait time is never longer than 15 minutes. Service is really quick, food usually comes out in 10-15 minutes!   Food I've only ever tried their bento boxes and have been coming back almost every week to eat it, I am absolutely obsessed! For just 15 dollars their bento box comes with your choice of teriyaki salmon, chicken, tofu or sushi rolls served with miso soup, a bowl of rice, salad, vegetable tempura, edamame, steamed vegetables and California rolls! What a deal! I honestly think every component in their bento box is fresh and very delicious. I am left highly satisfied and full after ever bento box. :)  I would have to get out of my comfort zone soon to try some of their other menu items! I will update this review once I do!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time by myself, there was still ample unoccupied seats at that time. I ordered their zaru soba lunch combo (even though it was so cold outside but I never tried it before). It came with an avocado roll and a few tempura pieces. For all that, it was around 12.99! For the zaru soba, I really liked the broth to dip the noodles in, it was really aromatic. The avocado roll was good, nothing fancy. As for the tempura, I really enjoyed it as it came right out of the fryer. Overall, service was good and I liked where I sat (the long table that faced the sushi bar) and I will possibly come back again some day to try their other foods!"}
{"text":"OMG! This is one of the best Jap restaurant I have been to! Definitely try the Unagi Don please people! Their eel is sooo fresh and they cut it real thick. Unlike the other unagi don, it doesn't taste fishy at all and they made this sauce just perfectly! I wanna go again the other day coz it was just amazing! Staff and service is excellent. Although it's a small store and space is a bit limited, the food they have gets the points!"}
{"text":"Super fresh sashimi! If there's anything you should get, it's the sashimi. We got it as part of the dinner combinations, which was a great deal since it also came with tempura, rice and miso soup/salad. The rolls, on the other hand, really suck. The Dynamite roll was tiny and not worth the price. Also ordered the unagi, which is a part of their grilled items menu. It is pricey, but they do give you a good amount -- most importantly, it was done really well!!  The place is tiny and cozy but service is great. We were very fortunate to find a table on a Friday night without reservations.   Before you ask for tea, you should know that they charge $1.00 per cup."}
{"text":"Gem! I adore the aesthetic of this restaurant! Lovely and intimate location in the Baldwin Village - perfect for a date! I ordered all vegetarian options and felt that there was plenty to select from -seaweed salad, miso soup, veggie tempera, and veggie rolls.  The only con is the service: I wanted to complete the meal with green tea ice cream but towards the end the waitress was not attending to my friend and I.  Not to worry, I would still give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on the quality of the Ramen I have at Konnichiwa.   Yes I like the Ramen here better than the one I have at Kenzo.   I found the noodles has much more bite to it VS Kenzo's one are a lot softer and has less texture and got really sloggy at the end of the bowl. Konnichiwa's noodle is best to be slurped and embrassed the hell out of  your dinnermate in a crowded restaurant!  I also love the lightly flavoured broth much better... especially the Miso soup based. It is light, has a hint of salty and a hint of sweetness and a hint of spiciness. (I don't even want to put any chilli powder or oil to ruin that taste) The Shoyu broth is A-ok too!  Just love small eatery like this. It feels so homey, cozy and the Japanese waitresses are all nice and polite with a great smile!  The kitchen here is really small, the seating here is limited..so if you come on a busy night, you might have to wait for everything!"}
{"text":"So delicious :) We had the chirashi, the black cod, and the taco wasabi, as well as a seaweed salad...  But this is not your typical toronto sushi restaurant! Everything was of the highest quality. The chirashi had an impressive selection of premium cuts,  the black cod was better than Guu's, the salad featured a variety of rare delicate seaweeds, and everything was beautifully presented.  The service was wonderful and the restaurant itself is warm, cozy and clean. A new favorite :)"}
{"text":"Very cute chalkboard work for all the menu, and the food there are awesome.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It was a hidden gem in Baldwin St., and I'm glad I get to try it with my family. We tried chicken karaage, tonkotsu ramen, pork cutlet curry, chicken donbury, and the soft shell crab.  Service is also excellent, and the staff are very attentive.    I work near this place and I probably will have my lunch here from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing it had high Yelp reviews.   Was greeted promptly and seated by the window. We both ordered the lunch specials (sushi and sashimi) which came with a side of miso and salad (the standard). The price is just a tad higher than other places for lunch, but the sashimi and sushi selection was better. It's the first time I've seen scallop sashimi on a lunch special! The sushi was really good and melted in my mouth. Im curious to try other things on their menu in the future!"}
{"text":"Came on Tuesday night at 8PM. This small joint was nearly packed - a good sign.   All of the waitresses were friendly and helpful throughout my visit. That alone warrants 1 star.   I ordered the BBQ eel + cucumber roll at ~$9.60 including tax. Although my food took longer than I expected, but it's definitely worth it for the eel alone. The eel was flavourful and really tasty. The only complain I have is the fish to rice ratio is too small. I can only savour the eel briefly before the rice taste overwhelms almost everything."}
{"text":"I've heard that ramen and sushi is pretty good here... would give them 3.5 if there's a half star choice, but definitely not a 4 so i ordered: 1. chicken Karaage        -10/10 , the perfect karaage chicken, tender chicken that is not too greasy and not too crispy,perfect! 2. seaweed salad       -8.5/10, a decent appetizer but they could use a bit more sauce inside, seaweed is good though! 3. classic sushi       -6/10,  disappointed.. come here expecting some high quality sushi, but turns out the rice is too sticky and the vinegar taste inside is not enough (in my opinion), fish on top is ok but not the best quality (to be fair, for this price, the sushi is not bad)  4. cold soba noodle       -10/10, delicious! a typical japanese style cold soba noodle with tempura and shrimp, yum! 5. ramen with miso garlic soup  and pork       -6/10, same as sushi, one of the dishes that i was expecting to be really good which turns out to be just ok. not salty enough, the noodle inside is good, pork is normal quality. for people who wants to try the best ramen at same price- choose Hokkaido Ramen Santouka or sansotei ramen (stay away from kinton ramen! too \"westernized\" taste, can't taste the real Japanese ramen from it)  OVERALL- 8/10 , will definitely come back to try out other dishes ;)"}
{"text":"Sadly closed indefinitely due to fire last week at neighbouring, Ryu's Noodle bar. :(  Hope they recover soon!"}
{"text":"really really nice unagi don. the unagi melts in my mouth. for 20, i think its fairly priced. sushi lunch is a bit disappointing that it came with 6pcs of small salmon roll plus 5 pcs of sushi, not the 11 pcs of sushi as described in the menu. but sushi quality is good. I will come back and try other food when I have a chance, because its rather hard to find good quality sushi, than to find cheap sushi places."}
{"text":"Went there once for ramen with a group of friends.... Enjoyed the experience so I returned with a Jap food expert.  Ordered a mini eel shabu shabu the second time I was there... Yumms!!  Oh, the octupus salad was delightful as well..."}
{"text":"Good Tonkotsu ramen. The broth was decadent and the noodles were good. It's also a lot more reasonably priced compared to other places for ramen"}
