{"text":"If Rosario Ristorante feels like the quintessential neighborhood Italian restaurant, that's because it is. It's been in the same spot for 30 years, and until a few years ago it was owned by the same family. When they were ready to sell, one of their loyal customers took up the gauntlet. Although Michelle and her husband completely gutted and redid the interior, the ambience is still that of a long established, timeless place. There's a red swag on the front windows and wrought iron decorations on the walls. Black tablecloths and nice stemware lend an upscale but not intimidating feel.

     The menu, too, is neighborhood. Nothing unexpected (except for escargots), but pretty much whatever you'd want to satisfy your southern Italian cravings.  We started out with crab-stuffed mushrooms, which the menu warned were spicy. Since it was happy hour, when all appetizers are half price (ditto cocktails), we paid $5.50 for six mushrooms delivered in an escargot dish. They were stuffed with just the right amount of crab mixed in with the bread crumbs, and a little cayenne added a pleasant kick. We had been served some outstanding garlic butter with our bread, and couldn't resist topping the mushrooms with it.  My entree was eggplant parmigiana, my \"test the new restaurant\" dish. The eggplant was thinly sliced, breaded and beautifully fried, but there was a strange absence of sauce. The same was true of the spaghetti - well prepared but under-sauced.  I had ordered a side of meatballs and was served a pair of huge ones - these were an unbelievable $3 - with adequate sauce. They were just the way I like them (you can stop snickering now), lots of bread crumbs mixed in to make them nice and tender. Ken had ordered a side of sausage, and that was excellent too. His lasagna was delicious. It was somehow light and substantial at the same time. The only disappointment was the Caesar salad. This was a ghost of a Caesar with an almost tasteless dressing that had never seen an anchovy.  Desserts are house made. We tried the chocolate mousse pie (it was called a cake, but really wasn't). It was good - you could actually tell it was chocolate. There's also a fried cannoli.  The espresso machine had broken down, so Ken can't report about that.

     The prices are quite reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity, as befits a neighborhood restaurant.  My eggplant was $12.95, and Ken's lasagna $9.95. The most expensive dishes, veal picatta and marsala, and cioppino are $18.95. Fettucini Alfredo and Spaghetti Bolognese are $10.95. Service was excellent. Our waitress, Vanessa, recognized us from her stint at Gino's Restaurant, one of our favorites. And, you can get a Restaurant.Com certificate. What more could you want? 

     Actually, you could want a 4 course chef's dinner for $15. This is served on Thursday evening, and it's content changes every week. Call to see what's being prepared if you don't feel like taking a chance.

     To past reviewers who complained about the bar next door, just park down at the end beyond the bar. As for the service - ask for Vanessa."}
{"text":"Do you want the good or the bad news first? 

The good news is the food is wonderful. I have been to Rosario's many times and have had a good taste bud experience.

Bad news, the service is TERRIBLE. If you have two hours to kill and are okay with being thirsty and hungry then Rosario's is your place. I found the waiters to be sarcastic and uneducated about their menu.

In my personal experience, my order has been confused with another person, I have not received the salad that comes with my meal twice, had to ask for the bread that comes with the meal, been charged extra for items that are supposed to be included with the meal and waited an average of 40 minutes for a simple entree. 

It is too bad because the food is good enough to want to go back to Rosario's, but the service is so horrible that you would have to pay me for the time lost."}
{"text":"This place has pretty darn good food, and the service for us was decent because their wasn't really anyone else there.

 It is in a small strip mall that is pretty much empty except for a bar next door. The location probably doesn't help business out due to the fact that everyone else is out of business.

The owner is very nice and really are passionate about their food and restaurant, asking if everything was good, etc..

My only real complaint is that both times that I have gone there, people from the bar next door wonder in and both times, were distracting when we were trying to have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant which works for a reasonable dinner or a special celebration. Wine list offers nice selection; not all restaurants offer a free upgrade on the wine if they are out of your choice but Rosario's graciously did, immediately.  Food was good - pasta dinners were under $9. It was appreciated that the chef would add gorgonzola to the fettucini Alfredo - mmm. Server is a diamond in the rough; a few shadow opportunities of exquisite waiters and she would have it down pat. Either way, my beau and I  look for opportunities to return.

The restaurant was a bit warm, as well as the wine."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, what a hidden gem! What a Fabulous experience!!! The food was fresh and delicious. The service was excellent and the ambience was warm
 and inviting.  I had the Chicken Cynthia it was amazing! We will be back.
P.S. The bathrooms were something out of a five star resort!"}
{"text":"We've tried this place a couple of times and we were not impressed.

The restaurant was relatively empty when we visited, yet it still took the server a very long time to bring us our drinks or to do just about anything, including check on us.

We didn't like the bread at all, it has a biscuit-like texture and didn't taste good. They really need to switch it out for some good, warm Italian bread.

The main entree pastas and the salads we did enjoy. Good food.

The restaurant itself and the interior is very nice, with a charming decor and ambiance. Each table has its own candle and the bar area looks pretty cool. The wine and beer selection is good. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of some tasty Pinot Grigio from Italy during our visit.

Overall, the lackluster service will keep us away. Hopefully you'll have a better experience there if you try it out.

UPDATE: The owner contacted me about my review and said that they have changed the bread to a warm crusty Italian bread now and have increased staff to provide better service, although an increase in staff wouldn't have helped with the bad service that we experienced. She also mentioned that they are a small family owned restaurant and value each and every customer very much, which is nice to hear."}
{"text":"The Strange:  

\"Oh [crap], someone pissed on the hood of my car!\" yells a man walking out of the bar next to the restaurant.

Waitress asking our party of 5 if we had reservations...with an empty dining room behind her.

Being seated next to a doorway...with an empty dining room around us.

Having 3 people waiting on us...and still getting a drink order wrong and having to wait over 10 minutes for our bill...with an empty dining room around us.

Strips of what looked like toilet paper anchoring the black tablecloths...okay so they weren't actually toilet paper, but that was our first thought.  A better idea would have been to use some strip of cloth or linen...

A large carafe of soda was placed on our table...which was nice because we never ran out of beverage...but usually that happens when a restaurant is busy and the waitress is worried she can't get our drinks to us fast enough.  I never had that in a nearly empty restaurant.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other than these strange things, this seemed like it could be a nice restaurant to go to if only a few things were tweaked.

Although it's not their fault, the restaurant is located in a dilapidated shopping center, and one of the waitresses commented that the interior several years back had looked just like the outside until it was bought and redone.

Our Food:

The garlic bread was a delicious cheesy chewy creation served with definitely homemade marinara.

The crab soup was a little disappointing; real crab mixed with fake crab in a thick broth...it wasn't terrible, but neither did it wow me.  It almost needed something more.

I had the swordfish.  Blackened crust with a honey buerre blanc sauce.  It was served over penne with capers and tomatoes.  The swordfish was grilled perfectly.  It was moist and meaty and the buerre blanc was pleasantly creamy with a hint of sweetness.  My only criticism of the dish was that the capers - as much as I LOVE capers - completely took over the honey buerre blanc if you ate a bite of fish and pasta together.  It seemed like it should have been one or the other to be the perfect dish.

Someone else had the New York Strip.  It was cooked perfectly...for me.  He had ordered it medium, but it was more on the medium rare side.  I personally like some red...but if a customer orders it a certain way, it should be cooked that way.

The other dishes ordered included the Fettucine Alfredo, the Chicken Marsala, and the Baked Ziti.  Everyone was very satisfied with their dish.  The Chicken Marsala friend only wished there had been more mushrooms.

Entrees start at $10 and go up to $20.  The portions are large!  We couldn't fit any dessert, although they sounded quite tempting.

The Conclusion:

We had a nice meal, but everything from decor to service to food left me a little short.  This place is like 'The Little Restaurant that almost could'.  Lots of potential....just needs an extra oomph."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I was a semi-regular. The food then was to die. More recently, I moved back onto town and I was eager to sink my taste buds into their quisine. Took a date with, bragging about how wonderfull the place is. When we got there, the place was empty. That should have been the first clue. We were asked if we had a reservation and the lady made a big deal about looking through her empty reservation book to make sure we be in the way if a big scheduled party was scheduled to come in. (One other couple came in before we left). I had fetichini Alfredo.  The sauce was gritty like it came from a dry mix. My date wasn't impressed at all with her order either. The quality of their food wasn't even in same ballpark from what I loved before.  When I found out that the place had been sold, I understood completely.  The service was good, but the food just isn't what it used to be."}
