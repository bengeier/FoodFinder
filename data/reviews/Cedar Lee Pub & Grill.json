{"text":"Perfect place for a beer and a burger! Great beer selection and good bar food. Best nachos in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his friends have been to this joint a couple times and thought it was about time for me to experience the burgers and beer, and I have to say I'm happy I did.  

We walked onto the small, but comfortable patio and got right to it - beers for the boys (vodka for me, obvi), burgers for all.  The beer selection seems pretty great, although I didn't take a good look at it.  My boyfriend ordered a Christmas blend that was in limited production from a brewery and the bartender even offered to comp him a different beer if he wasn't pleased. 

As for the food, thought it was pretty good - the onion rings were to die for (HIGHLY suggest you try these - it's for your own good!).  The burger selection is pretty extensive, although they can help you build your own - I wanted everything that came on a turkey burger, minus the turkey part (I needed to get my red meat fix in to satisfy me for the next month) and they were more than willing to make sure to fulfill my burgerlicious wishes (and if I remember correctly, at no extra charge - thanks guys!).  

If you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere where you can eat, drink, and watch Sports Center for a good price (I'm pretty sure this is every guy's dream), then check out the pub - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar. The place is clean, good menu prepared right and a staff thats friendly and knows the meaning of hospitality. Thats the condensed version.

The Look: It's a local pub, the name says it all. It's not trying to be something it isnt. and what it does try to do it does it well. There are enough televisions to see whatever game your looking for. The bathroom is also clean, that in itself is a good indication of quality. If the bathroom is gross, what does the kitchen look like? 

The food and drinks: I had a Blue cheese mushroom bacon burger with chips. I ordered it medium. It came out medium well. However, the burger was juicy and very tasty. Seasoned correctly with the right amount of balance between cheese muchrroms and bacon. I can forgive the tiny temperature error, the burger was worth it. I also had a 22oz Dortmunder from Great lake Brewery for $4.50, a steal in my opinion. the PBRs i switched to after were only $2.50 for 22oz.. Well worth the money.

The Staff: Professionals, would be a good term to sum up my thoughts. Phil Carol is a great bartender/host. Now when I say host I do not mean the sixteen year old girl thats hired because shes slightly/is pretty, and they need someone to stand at the front door greeting people. I mean the person that brings you into their home, welcomes you, and makes you feel like a part of something. In far to many establishments the average walk in patron is ignored, marginalized, Phil makes it a pleasure to sit at his bar.

Conclusion: There are a lot of options in the Cedar Lee area, there are a lot of options on Coventry. However for my money I will be going to Cedar Lee and hanging with my new friends. Its well past time that we got back to the cheers mentality and find ourselves a bar where everyone know your name. That bar for me will be Cedar Lee."}
{"text":"I like this place so much! They have tons of creative burger combos and their Mac and cheese always calls my name. It's a total hole-in-the-wall bar in the best way."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! If you're looking for somewhere good to go without a wait go here!"}
{"text":"This bar will always hold a special place in my heart. I have been going here ever since I moved to the east side of Cleveland. \"B\" and I always go here when we don't feel like cooking but don't want to go somewhere fancy to eat. We know we will be greeted like friends and served good food. 
They have a great list of burgers. My particular favorite is the Blue Shroom Burger. Their mac n cheese is also laced with some scarily addictive things. They always have a pretty good selection of beers on tap as well.
The staff is always great and attentive. Since \"B\" and I have been coming here, we have come to know their manager, Dan, quite well. He is awesome and always makes sure you have a full glass of whatever you're drinking and that you are satisfied with your experience. Half the reason we go here so frequently is because of him. 
Definitely give this place a try if you're passing through the Heights or if you live in the neighborhood. Food is good, staff is great, and their prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for the $5 burger and beer night over a month or so ago and can't stop thinking about it.  I went, planning on having a semi-tasty burger and a cheap beer and simply enjoying myself, but I was pleasantly surprised!  My beer was a beer-no messing that up, but my burger was spectacular!! One of the best burgers I have had in a long time! The flavor was great and the price was just as delicious!

Our service was great and it wasn't insanely packed like I figured a $5 burger and beer night would be.  Clearly, I want to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff overall, fairly clean...not divey so much but not yuppy either. Decent pricing but not as cheap as it could be. OK selection and nice patio in the back with separate bar for hanging out and maybe having a smoke if that's your thing."}
{"text":"We stopped in after seeing The Room at the Cedar Lee. It was completely empty so we were actually able to hear the jukebox. It was great! Total throwback to the 90's and some early 2000s indie stuff. The bar staff was very cool and friendly like they liked their job. Who doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"We sat at the outside bar and we were waited on by Heather.  She was nice and helpful.  I ordered my craft beer which was a good tasting beer.  Then I decided to order a burger, which Heather mentioned that if you order the Burger you get a free Miller Lite draft for Monday's Beer & Burger night, how can you go wrong with that.  Good food, fries were a little serving compared to my buddies.  But all-in-all everything was good."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in the Cedar Lee area.  It is never too crowded, perfect for a low-key night.  They have a nice patio in the back with a TV that I can't wait to re-open for the spring.  

A large selection of burgers (30+) and they always have $7 pitchers of Labatt! (Compared to $4/bottle at the Tavern).  Their appetizers are decently priced and tasty.  

Bar tenders here are the friendliest and most-attentive around.

$5 burger and beer on Monday (includes fries!) and Karaoke (don't remember which day)."}
{"text":"I miss summer nights attempting to do well at trivia and eating at the pub. I like their burger selection and have rarely had any trouble finding a table.

A hidden gem on their menu is the funnel cake sticks. They bring so much joy to the fat kid inside me. One time their awesome jack of all trades, Dan even ran to CVS to get more ice cream for them since they ran out. What a gem. 

My only gripe is that sometimes their tables are a bit sticky and some of their servers dish out some resting bitchy face. Maybe they just need some funnel cake sticks."}
{"text":"I took Yelp's advice and decided to check out this local establishment with the family and some friends.  I was impressed by the menu, which seemed to indicate something above average pub grub.

The good news - the food was solid.  Not great, but solid.  The calamari was obviously frozen, and the wings, while meaty, came with a very thin teriyaki sauce.  I ordered the Amanda burger, which was pretty good.  Only complaint would be the the fried egg was over-cooked, so that the yoke did not spill out (which is the point of the fried egg in the first place!).  The other members of my party seemed relatively pleased with their meals, as well.

The bad news - first of all, the place had little to no a/c, and when I asked the bartender/waitress if she could turn the fan on right above our table, she said she didn't know how to turn it in.  Really?  Well, hope the other members of my party didn't mind me sweating profusely throughout the meal.  The other issue was sad, but still unpleasant.  What was presumably a homeless person came into the restaurant and occupied the nearest restroom for about a half an hour.  This was a little bit of a problem seeing as how we had five children in our party with child-size bladders.  Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do, but the employees of this establishment should be aware that customers are put off by situations like this.

I'm sure the positive reviews were legitimately earned, but this experience was one that will likely prevent a second try.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"Decided to try the 're-opened' pub on lee.  While I was hoping for the food to be good, but just turned out to be ok.  We ordered some spinach artichoke dip to start...  Hoping for some kind of tortilla chips  to go along with (like the menu said) - instead we were given something the resembled deep fried pita chips but we were not able to nail down what exactly they were.   I ordered a burger, which was overcooked and resembled some kind of charcoal nugget.  The free cut french fries were great, but how hard is deep frying a spud.  The place is clean, but the food lacks - I will go back for drinks but will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Being local and without cable, I go out to watch games. The Pub used to be my favorite stop for games. I have been countless times. I kept going back because they always have a few good taps and lots of TVs and most of the time I can get a seat to watch whatever game I'm there to see. The service has always been good. I'd agree with Amy below, the bartenders seem to enjoy what they do and the atmosphere is good.

Despite frequent visits, I never got any food until fairly recently. I had looked over the menu a few times, but I thought things were a little pricey. I became much more interested in their menu when I started to see the daily specials board outside and I decided I need to stop in and add these guys to my East Side Cheap Grub list. Well, I haven't done the weeknight special yet, but soon.

I did, however, try some of the food last weekend during the OSU game. It was good enough. As I have mentioned elsewhere I judge a bar by their nachos, so I got the nachos. I would say they pass, but they do not impress. Smallish quantity and nothing creative going on at all. We also tried the mac and cheese, which was quite tasty. I would recommend it, although the quantity/price rations still leave something to be desired. I'll be going in soon to check on the weeknight specials and I'll be sure to report back, meanwhile, they get a pass on the food."}
{"text":"I do love going to this location for bar food.  Food is yummy.  Especially their special burger with moz sticks, avocado, egg etc.  Try it.  You will love it!!!!  The staff is kind of slow sometimes.  That would probably be my only complaint."}
{"text":"Our first time there. Service was perfect. And the Burger was the best i have had since i can remember. Don't let the small bar atmosphere steer you away from quality and hospitality.  It was all above par. Loved everything about this place. Monday nights offer a beer and a Burger for 5 bucks... i felt like i was ripping them off.  I will be dreaming about this meal. Yum"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and this is our go-to spot to have some beers and watch the game or for dinner on a night we don't feel like cooking. Lots of TVs, big bar. Nothing fancy - lives up to it's name but it's endearing. The bar staff is awesome and they have a good time at work as some other reviewers said. Kelly is the best she knows the names of all the regulars and is really down to earth to chat with.

Food is good. Huge selection of burgers. Monday $5 burger and Labatt special is better than the one down the street and they have some other weekly specials too. Nachos are can be hit-or-miss but I've had them several times and enjoyed them. 

The back patio bar and seating area they opened last summer is a big plus. We love this neighborhood bar and will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I LOVE it here!  any time my friends and i are looking for a place to go on Lee you can bet we chose here or at least wind up here at some point during the evening.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming.. after going there twice it's like you are already part of the family :)
They made a wise investment when they decided to build their patio/outside bar. 
  The food is your basic bar food but it tastes really good!!! i highly suggest their mac and cheese!  it's also very fairly priced :)"}
{"text":"This is my husband's \"bar\" and often I like to accompany him here with our 18-month old daughter.  I know that sounds bad, but this little hole in the wall is actually not a bad place to take kids and babies right around 5:30 or 6 p.m. for dinner.  They have a great burger selection and we often see other families with young children there.  Sometimes the fries can be really greasy, but overall it is a reasonably priced place with good burgers.  A strong staple for the Heights area."}
{"text":"This reminded me of Johnny Malloy's in Lakewood. It is a normal sports bar type place. They have a trivia night which really engaged the crowd. I met some friendly people here and had some good conversation. The beers are good and affordable. They had Stone IPA on draft and bottles of Ephemere. Part of me wishes I would have moved closer to my job and pulled the trigger on moving to the east side. A lot of singers have mentioned this. John Frusciante said \"I regret my past\". Jay-Z (although I can't stand him, his first album was good though) said \"This is the number one rule for your set, in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets. If through our travels we get separated; never forget in order to survive gotta live with regrets\". Master Ace had a song called \"No Regrets\". So do I really regret not living closer to the Pub On Lee? Not really. I can always come here like I did a couple weeks ago. It isn't that cool. It is one of the better bars on Lee Road though."}
{"text":"Lots of variety on the menu. (try the veggie panini if you're into meat-less fare - very good).  Usually a decent selection of beers - almost always with an IPA available (my favorite).
Service is way above average, and it's just a very comfortable, relaxing spot with good food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger with my choice of toppings and it was very good.  However, the service left a lot to be desired.  We ended up just leaving cash on the table and leaving because our server never came back to check on us.  We were outside and walked through the interior bar on our way out and it was pretty empty so I'm not sure why the service was bad that night??"}
