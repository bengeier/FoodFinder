{"text":"Absolutely the type of bar I look for.  Has awesome food and super        great service.  Has a \"Cheers\" -like appeal. Maybe I'm somewhat biased but I've tried plenty of bars. Smaller and friendly."}
{"text":"I've whiled away quite a few afternoons at this quaint watering hole on 51st St SW. The primary draw to this place in the afternoon are the VLTs. I'm pretty sure there's a retirement community in the area, because the oldsters make up a disproportionately large segment of the clientele at this hour. Ladies gambling and gossipping, and dudes sitting around stoically drinking draft beer.  Basically, this place is like a Tim Hortons, but with gambling.  I'm sure the average age of clientele decreases as the night progresses, but I've only been there in the early evenings myself.
The pub itself is full of dark, rich woods, and the service is always friendly and timely. There are both table and booth seating, and a full kitchen with everything from nibblers to mains, as well as daily specials."}
{"text":"A nice quiet pub that serves fairly cheap lunches quickly. Went in on a Snowy Tuesday lunch time and had the New York Steak Sandwich meal (Dirt cheap I might add!). I honestly have no faults on the meal. The Fries (So tempted to call them Chips, Curse my Britishness!) appeared to be homemade fresh steakhouse style. Cooked very well also, not overdone and not dry. (Though if it is dry, nothing malt vinegar can't handle!)

Staff were friendly as well, no complaints. Definitely recommend to people who work nearby this place and can't be bothered to go home for lunch!"}
{"text":"Its a pub in a strip mall, the server was pretty, the drinks where quick, and the food seemed ok.
I did come here expressly for the burger, and was a bit let down by it. I Wouldve only given them 3 stars, I had a really bad date here, and the waitress flirted with me a bit after just to make me feel better. Customer service is on point.
I would go here again, but Its super out of my way"}
{"text":"Last night I was playing a vlt at Bob's and went out for a smoke. When I came back the waitresses boyfriend was playing the machine that I had hung a sign on and had over one hundred dollars in. When I complained about it. I was kicked out of buffalo Bob's with out my money and told to not come back. ."}
{"text":"Hidden away in a little strip mall, Buffalo Bob's does not disappoint.

I'm a big fan of dive bars and Buffalo Bob's does not disappoint. Great friendly service with the traditional pub fare you'd expect. I tried the wings and the steak sandwich and both were good. The wings were 30 cents each but were worth it as they're bigger than your average wing. The steak sandwich was also on special for $8 and came on a piece of garlic toast with a huge serving of fries. They also have big TVs for watching football or hockey and have specials on during the games which are worth checking out.

Awesome dive bar that I will be back to in the future."}
{"text":"Wow - what a crazy bad place this has turned into.  For context - I sat at the bar on this brief visit and there was one other person at the bar.

If you want flat beer - go to Buffalo Bob's right now - they are out of CO2 and think they are fine.  I went in and was offered a sample of the only microbrew they had on tap. I told the bartender that it was really flat and he said it must be the end of the keg.  I asked him what the low side pressure should be and he was lost.  I tried a Budweiser and it was also very flat - like no bubbles coming up 30 seconds after it was placed in front of me.  Lame!

When the bartender first greeted me - I asked for a menu.  He said \"they are out on the tables\".  There were maybe 14 people in the place and none of them had menus so I was confused as to what he meant.  And there were not menus on the unoccupied tables either.  When he came back five minutes later he asked if I wanted to order from the menu.  When I stated I did not yet have a menu he produced one that was tucked along the bar in front of me out of my view.

The only other customer at the bar had a full flat beer too.

If there were a Canadian version of \"Bar Rescue\" this place would be a perfect contender."}
{"text":"Total dive bar. Food is so-so at best. I only gave them two stars because our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The staff are friendly and loving, the service is good, the food is deeeelicious, and overall the atmosphere is very comforting and relaxing."}
