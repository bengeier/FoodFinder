{"text":"This place sets the bar for how a restaurant should treats it's patrons.  I have been there three times and each time the device has been excellent. They treat customers like family.   They also cater to people with a Gluten allergy, which is very rare with a pizza shop!   I wish all restaurants operated the way Tommy's in North Ridgeville does.  I will always be more than happy to dine there in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered from Tommy's for the very first time today, 3-1-13. All we can say is SO GOOD. We had the plain wings with teriyaki sauce on the side and a Philly cheese steak pizza. AWESOME!!!  I think we found a new place to order from and have delivered to in North Ridgeville. Maybe next time we will go and eat there, but however it's served it is GREAT!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to North Ridgeville, and as a Chicago ex-pat I needed to find a good pizza place ASAP.  Tommy's was the second place we tried, based off of Yelp and neighbor reviews.  It was so disappointing!  We ordered a large pepperoni and green pepper pizza and the green peppers were obviously frozen prior. They were tiny, mooshy little black spots on the pizza. The sauce was alright and the crust was good.  I'd give it an average rating.  It's OK, but nothing that I'd be excited to order again"}
{"text":"I am giving them full stars for their gluten-free menu!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after a few locals raved about it. It's not as good as people say it is, its just ok. Edible? yes would I go out of my way to eat there? no. it wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5 rating.   I have been to Tommy's PCR three times and done carry out once last night.  One of my in person visits was to the regularly held gluten-free buffet. Whether you have celiac disease or are gluten sensitive, the buffet offers their regular salad bar with gluten-free dressings, a selection of pizzas with various (though not numerous) toppings, fried chicken, wings, dessert pizza, and at this most recent June buffet, fried fish.  As any GF person knows, these are among the main things which are hard to get GF.  While the addition of fish increased the price of the buffet, it also introduced people to it and probably gained a following.  I stuffed myself a bit too much, and as we stayed late at the last seating, we got to take home leftovers.  Obviously the regular occurances are more telling. My first time there, I went with two friends. We decided to order a large salad split between us, which I must say is perfect for 3 people wanting a medium small salad starter. I think I got a small GF cheese pizza while my friends shared a red calzone with green olives (my one friend really likes green olives, and since Danny Boys no longer works on account of me, this made up for it).  The dining room was kinda empty on that Saturday early evening, but that made it all the better for talking.  We all enjoyed our meals and went away satisfied but looking at the ice cream. (They sell Ruggles ice cream and have lots of ice cream treats, including draft root beer floats.)  I next went there with my folks on Independence day since no one felt like cooking. We got a large salad like last time, which was exactly right.  My parents ordered a medium-large pizza with some veggie toppings while I took benefit of the day's special and got the 4 piece chicken tender dinner, gluten-free of course. Tommy's has daily specials that are visible on their website, though there are more in the restaurant.  The dinner I got was huge--I could only finish two of the tenders. It also came with decent slaw, fries, and a small GF biscuit. My parents thought their pizza was great too.  Last night I was home alone, so I used their online ordering ($1 fee for use) to do a pick up order for 5pm.  Got there and waited a few minutes while they cut the pizza, but otherwise it was on time.  The trip home cooled the pizza a little more than I would have liked, but the rest of my order was great.  For cooking in your own oven they offer take and bake for an additional $2. You can freeze them as well.  Tommy's menu is huge, even if you are GF.  But coming from the GF stand, they offer much less chance of contamination and a menu of things you might have thought you would never eat again."}
{"text":"Epic fail on the Alfredo pizza.   Had an aftertaste that was worse than Albertson's Vodka with extra charcoal.    Update:  Tried something else.  This place blows.  Seriously, how can you mess up pizza in THE pizza state!?"}
{"text":"I've lived in N. Ridgeville for over 6 years and tonight was the first time we have eaten at Tommy's.  What the heck took us so long?  This was really good!  The service was completely head and shoulders above every other restaurant we've been to in recent times.   We had the pizza and wing.  The whole family loved it.  The kids also enjoyed the ice cream sundaes that came with their meals. The bowls were as big as their heads!    It took a long time for us to try it, but it won't be long before we o back.  Great job, Tommy's!  Thanks for a great family dinner!"}
{"text":"Ever since my boyfriend started a gluten-free (GF) diet we have been struggling to find restaurants that would cater to his needs. Typically, a gluten free menu means that the restaurant tells us what he can't eat and lists two or three crappy items that he can. Some places have a little more of an extensive GF menu and will have a dish or two that he may have. Tommy's has a dedicated GF menu, uses dedicated GF fryers and has staff that is knowledgeable about gluten intolerance. How exciting!!!!!  I think the owner is genius for providing to this niche of society. Tommy's restaurant is a little family restaurant located off the beaten-path in North Ridgeville. I  heard about Tommy's from a GF thread here on Yelp and also read about it in a book about eating out GF. I wish more restaurants would take the hint from Tommy's and would offer such an extensive a GF menu to it's customers.  First of all, Tommy's definitely isn't much to look at. While it is very clean and spacious the decor is minimal and not very exciting. To that I say, \"who cares?\" Most of the time the atmosphere of a restaurant factors greatly into my review, but in this case I could care less because of their GF menu.   One thing I hate is when a restaurant jacks up the heat in the winter. I get even more annoyed when they say they will adjust it and then pretend to go turn it down and don't. As soon as I walked into the restaurant I noticed it was really hot so I asked the waitress if she could turn it down a bit. She actually turned it down and never cranked it back up while we were there.  This is just one example of how accommodating the waitress was. She was very attentive and always made sure we had drinks that were full. She also made sure that we didn't sit with dirty dishes on our table. I definitely give Tommy's a thumbs up in the service department.  My boyfriend and I tried the GF pizza with pepperoni and banana peppers. After months of eating that overpriced frozen rice-based pizza one can find at the grocery store this was a welcome change. I can honestly say that Tommy's GF pizza was one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. The crust had a nice consistency and was a bit on the thin side...which was fine with us! It actually had a crunchiness to it  that we have yet to find with any other GF crust. I definitely give the GF pizza five stars! In addition to the pizza we tried the GF potato skins. They were also really good and very fresh. They were a tiny bit on the bland side, but nothing that a little bit of salt and pepper couldn't fix. I also ordered some garlic parmesan wings for myself. They were not GF. I thought they were great. The flavor was good and they were nice and crunchy...nothing worse than soggy wings in my opinion. Tommy's also offers a few GF desserts and GF beer that I would love to try sometime!  In addition to eating in and taking out Tommy's also does a take and bake for their customers. We live about 30 minutes away from the restaurant so this is a nice service. If we were to order take out the food would be cold by the time we got home. I love being able to take their pizza home and bake it in my own oven.   I am so glad that we decided to try Tommy's and we will definitely be back soon! If you have to follow a GF diet and are looking for a great place to eat I would definitely check them out!!!"}
{"text":"For the gluten free pizza it was most excellent! Such a treat for my son to be able to enjoy pizza. The GF crust was like the real thing, chewy and tasty. The regular pizza was good but pricey for what we got."}
