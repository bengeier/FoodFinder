{"text":"A very nice experience!! 
We ordered Biryani, Bihari kabab and Chicken karahi, everything exceeded our expectations by far,
 The most important ingredient for good food is \"Freshness\" and these guys have it figured out ! Biryani is the best I have ever tasted in any restaurant, Bihari and karahi was awesome as well. Unlimited sides & salads including 3 different kind of naans all you can eat with your entrees. 
Place is very clean and the service was excellent, very friendly waiters and the chef/owner took the time to explain all different dished, even offering free samples but we took their word for it and were very pleased with everything we had.
Finally an Indian/Pakistani restaurant with no \"shortcut\" food and no masalas from \"ready made\" packages.
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant! The first time we went to it was about six months ago. We were received warmly by the owner and service staff and were even given a sample of biryani to try. 

We decided to order their steak platter and an extra order of grilled chicken in case there wasn't enough the first time. The steak platter was amazing and we all enjoyed the poutine style serving platter. The whole family ended up being too full to finish our chicken but it was honestly amazing. The chicken was succulent, moist and cooked to perfection. 

On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays they do a sides buffet. You're welcome to treat yourself as you wait for your meals. The buffet includes a variety of options, anything ranging from fries to salads. They also have a few different options of naans, including a pizza naan which tastes great.

My personal favourite is their Parmesan Chicken, while my brother loves their steak. My dad is a huge fan of the biryani. 

The only negative thing I can think of is that they could be considered over staffed as a few servers will walk around with nothing to do..."}
{"text":"One of my friend recommended this..so finally i visited the place.here is my review..
(Location and exterior appearence): located in some how in industrial area and first impression was...opps! 
      (Interior): 
despite outerlook. I decided to go in, inspite my wife's opinion was in negative. Interior was lack of enough lighting..window glasses n some hanging curtain was all dusty n i believe never cleaned since installation. Kitchen was just behind the counter due to which inner atmosphere becomes hot(later felt). Enough space with separated hall and semi rooms..
(Washroom):
mens washroom was disgusting..i asked my daughter to go n check women washroom which was surprusingly clean.
(Table etc):
 table glass never cleaned n greasy, jugs water container n glasses were bad n low quality.dont pick menu cards or wash your hands after as they are greasy too.
(Menu)
Resturant is offering multi food choices.prices are reasonable but after looking at the quantity seems cheaper.
They offered beryani as it was ready but We tried mutton karahi. They said it will take 20 25 min to be ready but they gave after 50 mins. Meanwhile they left one fly on the table to enjoy the waiting period.i tried hard to get rid off but due to lack of light always escaped.naan was good.they gave garlic naan as a starter.
Serving was awwfully bad.mutton served in big karahi with arm length spoon.i think they cooked in the same karahi with same big big 'karcha' kind of spoon.
i cant figured out it is mutton or under the disguise of veel or beaf. I  asked the cashier but he with meaningful smile forwarded my quest to imran chef but he was adament to admitt that it is not beaf. Mr.imran was insisting that it is lamb or goat..but karahi and my heart was speaking otherwise. I told him that if it is 'beaf'then gravy is good but meat is hard and cant chew easily.
1.star for price
2.star for quantity 
 if u want to eat there just pick and go..dont sit..atleast you can create your own atmosphere.rest is your choice."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  I had the grilled chicken,karahi chicken & chicken biryani.  I'm not a lentils person but ..wow..really good.  And the beef kebobs..hands down...phenomenal.  and don't forget dessert...the gulab jamun were magnificent.  Can't wait to go back.   Great family ambience."}
{"text":"It's not really a traditional steak house but pretty much everything is grilled. Their chicken I found was far better than the beef which was better than the fish.

They have a neat thing where the sides are all ready and in a buffet style which you don't pay extra for so while you wait for your food, you can go and get anything else you want but ask first because I think this only applies when you get a platter. Their in-store menu was slightly different from the website. We ordered the platters because it was a large group but maybe I'd stick to just chicken next time. They had a steak platter which had a very strong sauce in it and I found that the beef wasn't the best but it was decent. The sides seemed mostly to be a mix between Arabic or South Asian.

It was nice and clean and the service was not bad but slightly weird because it's a mix between a buffet and a traditional restaurant leading to a bit of confusion. The prices were not that cheap but factoring in the sides on the buffet, it was very reasonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant has awesome Indian and North American food. Their New York Steak is excellent. But the Grilled Chicken breast and Hyderabadi Biryani is the best that I have had in North America.  This place is a definite visit. One caution is don't visit the place in a hurry because the chef takes some time to prepare the food fresh."}
{"text":"In town waiting for a bus to get fixed and this place was close. All I did was tell my waiter I was hungry and he brought me a plate of chicken biryani with a small salad. I've never had biryani before so I don't have any basis for comparison but, this was pretty good, I would have liked to have seen more chicken in it too. Being a place called grillin hut I would have liked to have tried something from the grill but I'm not going to be rude and turn away food brought out to me with a smile. A bit greasy and run down as a restaurant but the food and service was really good. Just be careful of the little chicken bones in the biryani. I guess that just ads authenticity, right? $9.03 had me walking out of the restaurant full so.... Win!"}
{"text":"This is not a fine dinning so for people dinning in, expect some delay in the food being brought to your table. I went with family on a busy Saturday night but the service is a little slow on usual days as well. The reason being they cook fresh! I think even with the delay people keeping coming back because of good food. 

Foodwise I would give them 5 stars. On weekends they have free buffet appetizers if you are ordering the main courses. The appetizer buffet has mini soomsas, spring rolls, Paaper, rice & daal, Salads, fries and spicy wedges. For the main course we ordered they Beef & chicken Kababs, chicken biryani and chicken karahi... and guess what! the naans are on the house as well. The food was exceptionally good, and cooked to perfection. The spicy were accordingly used and nothing was over done.  

The owner was quite nice to stop by our table after it slowed down a bit and asked if everything was ok.

The place has plenty of seating, and a prayer area as well. 

Overall, a good experience.


For my Muslim Bro & Sis - They serve halal meat and had the HMA sign on their menu."}
{"text":"Placed an order for take out. They told me it was going to be 20 minutes. After waiting 45 minutes I asked them how much longer it was going to be and they did not even care that I had been waiting long. Customer service was horrible. If you want to wait all day for your food then come here, otherwise go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here as I have heard good reviews and their menu looked really good.

However, the website did not inform that currently they are having a buffet due to Ramadan.

The food was not good. Small variety and everything was too salty. The tikka was not cooked properly. 

The kheer tasted as if it was cream and cooked rice put together. 

The place is a run down. Most of the food went to waste and 20 dollars per person was not worth it.

Unfortunately I dont recommend this place."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have never dined-in but from the looks of the place take-out is best
I got their mixed grill ($30) with garlic naan/fries and everything was presented well, customer service was great, there was a little bit of a wait but my order came out in a nice small foil tray, it was large enough to feed 2-4 big-eaters so the price was right. It came with beef, chicken and fish-all were excellent. 

They have a take-out biryani special for $6-7, I often get this and the flavour is amazing for the price, it includes enough meat. Most people I saw there were ordering the special which came with Chicken or Veal (I prefer the chicken, veal has too much fat). The only con about the biryani special is that the spice level varies when i order, sometimes its too hot and sometimes its just right. Other than that if you need a cheap quick meal to feed lots of people this is your place. 

They can improve their Raita that comes with the biryani which is currently a BRIGHT green colour."}
{"text":"Terrible slow service and unclean environment.

There was trash in front of the restaurant. Food came out in 40mins and we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"The meats are tender and delicious, perfect spice levels, literally melts in your mouth without being greasy or overwhelming. Staff is friendly and welcoming. I've been here a few times now and I have to say, it's quickly becoming my favorite restaurant. On weekends they do a sides buffet - don't abuse it, you'll need to save room for the entrees. And dont fear if you come on a weekday - even without the buffet they give you a great selection and portion of sides. Haven't had anything here that was less than perfect. I really recommend the ancient beef kebab or the eye of round. 

Amazing service, amazing food, amazing prices. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Service was below average i ordered karahi chicken and they somehow forgot to give me plates i had to get up and bring plates for food i requested soda with the food they forgot that too and they forgot to put water on the table , worst experiance"}
{"text":"Dull environment but good food. We ordered a platter and a karahi, and kids had a ball on the free appetizers. Daal, rice, salad bar, wedges, etc were the star in appetizers. Fish, seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, were nicely done .. the servers lauded their steaks but we took the BBQ route today. Will go again for their steaks .. the prices were not high, and overall it was an experience worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, everything is grilled and very fresh, one of the few good halal grill type places, I've had the chicken great, chicken Parmesan, and various steaks, can't go wrong and prices are fair. Service is mediocre though. The prayer area in one corner of the restaurant can make an awkward dining experience if you're close by, but that isn't a big issue."}
{"text":"All i have to say is.  Best chicken biryani in town    I always go there for biryani.  Staff is so friendly.  If you are a first customer   Yll get one biryani free.   Close to my wrk.  Definitely go back.   Thank you. Grillin hut."}
{"text":"You read all the reviews and get the idea what the problem is with this place...The food is decent but the service is horrible, the staff becomes confrontational for no reason and it looks like the place has not been cleaned for years, I would pass this place for a take out but dine in is a big no !!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. They don't listen to you from ordering to feedback. 

Bland, flavourless food."}
{"text":"The location is not the best, the inside atmosphere also. The furniture, lightening, outlay is poor.
The food is very good taste wise and portion wise. There is a side buffet containing the salad, sauce, rice, potato and bread, free of charge.
The staff is very courteous and welcoming."}
{"text":"Really Good Food, and service. Tried the Veal Biriyani & Mixed Grill platter. Well prepared meats. This was my second visit & they didn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was below par. I had to ask for almost everything. Guys guys working there were cool but they need to be trained and incentivized to serve customers."}
