{"text":"I'm a first timer and this place is great!!!! Delivery was on point. Delivery person was very respectful. Oh yeah food was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the duck which is a must for this restaurant. The skin is really crispy and the sauce is sweet."}
{"text":"Ordered chow mein and Mongolian beef , both were excellent , fast service and the good came in so quick"}
{"text":"Very good food, reasonably priced with large portions.  Clean and quiet.  Their dumplings and egg rolls were very good."}
{"text":"This place takes me back to my awesome uni years in Tennessee. The General Tso's Chicken and Crab Ragoons are dishes that I dont usually find in Chinese restaurants in L.A. So, it was fun when I saw the dishes on the menu.   The place is clean and comfy. Service was fast and polite. 10/10.  Food is sooo good, especially the General Tso's Chicken. Not too sweet nor too spicy. A bit crunchy since it has the perfect amount of sauce. Pure deliciousness!! Portion is large. Decent prices."}
{"text":"We're here in Las Vegas for the WFG Convention and we're looking for a great Chinese food place that delivered to the hotels on the strip. Boy did we luck up on this place! Gary was amazing, from order to delivery he took great care of us. Not only did he drive farther than usual to bring us our food but he even threw in a special treat. To eat, we had the veggie fried rice, Mongolian beef and honey walnut shrimp. All taste fresh and delicious! Thanks for a great experience. Next time we're in Vegas we'll be sure to dine again."}
{"text":"Terribly rude delivery boy with cleft lip rude talking down to me disgusted that I was the Customer saying stuff like \"how did you find out about us\" in a way as if he was shocked I found them thier rice was greasy and had to much soy sauce the dumplings was ok but I won't be eating thier again seems like thier looking for more of a all American customer base my husband is white (marine) I'm black but if only you seen how rude he was to me and disgusted by me your mouth would have dropped eat here at your own risk"}
{"text":"Super nice place. Tons of room for groups. Gary was friendly and super helpful. The honeydew boba smoothie was delish. The combination fried rice was perfect, not super greasy. My boyfriend and I fought over the last bite. Will recommend and be back."}
{"text":"I must say this is the best place to stop by and get some Chinese food. The whole staff is nice and they provide excellent customer service and I find myself there pretty much every single day and that's how you know I just can get enough lol. There drinks and smoothies are really good oh and did I mention there food is really good as well . Everything there is so good to the point where my coworkers see my food and drink,they send back over there to get them ether a smoothie or food. Thank you guys for the excellent service you guys are the best! Gabe, Xavier and Caylon ^_^"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this Chinese Restaurant.  It is clean and the ingredients especially the vegetables are fresh.  The place is quiet and they serve beer and sake.  5 stars!  The fruit smoothie is excellent too!"}
{"text":"We have a new favorite Chinese delivery place.  The food is better than our usual spots and the price is right.  Even the beef they use is really good.  Which is hard to say about the other places in the area."}
{"text":"This place is very nice.  I was a little confused about the name, but when I met Gary and the staff, I understood!  They are great!  Very friendly.  While I was standing at the counter ordering my take out, I noticed the LARGE selection of smoothies on the wall, right behind the counter.  O.M.G., I thought.  That's awesome!  I couldn't help myself.  I had to order a smoothie, Blueberry-Pomegranate, with my meal.  Mmmmmm, goood.  Great pork dumplings, too!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, Owner Gary is so nice! He brought us free drinks!"}
{"text":"This place had TERRIBLE service. Each plate was set out one at a time. The food was not even that good and it took forever for our drinks to even get ordered. There wasn't very many people in the restaurant at the time but it still took forever to get our food. I would never recommend this restaurant unless you like \"ok\" food, bad service, and waiting a long time."}
{"text":"I thought I cant find chinese food in vegas but iwas wrong?this restaurant is cleanwaiter is nice and food is delicious"}
{"text":"Great customer service + great food + great smoothies = great experience!!! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with no expectations. Ordered Kung Pow Chicken, seafood fried rice, and shrimp dumplings. Was told that the shrimp dumplings had pork in it so I ordered the veggie dumpling. I don't eat red meat or pork. Was recommended to order the combination fried rice and they would add more shrimp and remove the meat.   The combination fried rice had beef in it. They charged me for squash dumplings which is not on the menu and one dollar more than the meat dumplings. When did squash prices raise higher than shrimp and pork?  All the food came out cold. Peanuts in the kung pow chicken were raw. Food was not good.  Service was better than other restaurants but we were the only people there.  Only redeeming point to my visit here were the two smoothies that they comped us: mango and durian. They were actually pretty good. We asked for low sugar and they actually have us what we wanted.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We just had lunch here.  We ate at some very pricey restaurants while in LV, and had our best meal here.    The food here is good and a good value.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special.  For $7.95 you get an entree,  flavorful egg drop soup, a cream cheese rangoon, and eggroll. My companion had orange beef which he enjoyed. The rice was cooked properly, not mushy. We had the homemade pork dumplings. They were tasty and well seasoned. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Tried the pan fried fish dumplings.  They were good.  I would have liked some sauce with a little more zip.  Will definitely try again to sample other items."}
{"text":"The general manager  was excellent,  he went out of his way to make sure everyone was taking care of, even with a shortage in their staff. The food was excellent,  awesome roasted duck. Great place. The real fruit smoothies are also must try."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Just drove into town and wanted something away from the casinos. Kung pao chicken was perfect with steamed rice. Also had a strawberry smoothie."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was pretty good.  The roast duck was crispy and tender. The price was reasonable.  The boba was a disappointment. It was tough and not chewy."}
{"text":"The best service I have ever had at a Chinese restaurant. Classes were always full, empty plates were always taken, and the owner and you even came out to talk to us making sure we were satisfied. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in, but now I think I can fairly say that this place is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas.   We had the roasted duck and it was cooked perfectly. Still juicy, but tender and flavorful. Also not overly seasoned. And for $12 it was a lot of food. We split it and still had half the dish to take home.  Also our server Gary was the best. He was so friendly and professional. He poured the tea for us and anticipated our needs."}
{"text":"Wow! Fast delivery, amazing food! And that sh#t was hot!   I just had my very first hand made pot sticker.   F#CKING AWESOME.   Tried the Shrimp kung poa and the pan fried noodles. Bomb. Hot and sour soup? Bomb. Followed our notes (finally- wife cant eat bean sprouts) and made the kung poa and soup spicy as f#ck.   Definitely ordering again. Fair prices, fast delivery, and good food. That's what it's all about, right?"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Extra friendly, clean and fun environment. I love boba drinks! the food is also amazing. great place to stop by and have a refreshing drink and appetizing meal.   - CRICKET WIRELESS :D"}
{"text":"This place won't disappoint... Perfect Chinese delivery.  Lots of flavor but not too sweet or greasy... We tried other places but this one lives up to their name.  super cheerful service, very nice people and great food."}
{"text":"We ordered the dumblings, the boss man highly recommended it. He said they make them in house.  Basa fish dumblings - very good  I would go back again for them Singapore rice noodles - decent Salt and pepper squid - this dish is why they didn't get 5 stars Smoothies - boss man said only real fruit, I think he's right"}
{"text":"I ordered food from through Eat 24... The delivery time was great but I received combination noodles instead of combination rice. Of course I didn't notice it until the guy had left, so I was stuck with the wrong order and everything else was so disgusting. The meats were rubbery and the General Tso was over-cooked and hard. I will never order from them again. So over-priced for such poorly made food. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"We been to this location serial times for different ethnic foods but all not survived. We give it a try since its new  so We ordered all three different types of dumplings ( shrimp, pork & cabbage, and fish). Out of three , we liked the shrimp dumpling most and all were juicy,  but lack a bit of flavor. Overall, not too bad will be back for their fresh fruit smoothie though."}
{"text":"Great food and AMAZING service! Gary definitely went above & beyond for us! Thanks Gary I'm stuffed!"}
{"text":"Do I need a reason to be cheerful? Absolutely not. But then comes along a business that makes me want to be more cheerful than I already am, and that place is Cheerful House Chinese Cuisine.  What should I cheer on first? How about the hometown team aka the dumpling? Ok I'll start with that. Big, tasty dumplings. Ones that make you go \"mmm mmm mmmm\". They make pork ones, fish ones, and shrimpy ones. You know I'm all about that. And then some. And you get a choice. Choices are wonderful. Pan fried, steamed, or in soup form. Try 'em all. You know I did. Which one is the bestest? That's up for you to decide. I'm keepin it on the rizzle this time, so I'll go pan fried.   They got some bubble tea dranks. I liked em, not too sweet for some of em. Chewy balls. Not too shabby. Shabbalicioso. To the max. Max Payne. In the membrane.  Other then the dumpleroonies, they serve the usuals that you would normally see in a Chinese resto. But I gotta admit, it's hella lotta betta than most places. Had a ton of fun with the chow fun. It was good enough to make a nun run to the sun. No pun intended. Note: the mapo tofu is more soy based here than chili based you would normally find, but hey, it was good so I is are not complaining. You know what I mean, you know what I'm sayin, kid.   Like it, good value and portions. Fits my palate, that's all I care about. JT says \"it's gonna be maaay\", all about them dumplings."}
{"text":"Great staff!  You can really tell they care.  Just ordered the food, but all of their recommendations were taken and very excited to try."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their dumplings, and I am OBSESSED with them. Their pork dumplings are my favorite, and I usually get them pan fried. Very tasty and juicy (almost reminds me the little soup dumplings aka xiao long bao). They make their dumplings freshly by hand, and although they only have three options, you can ask them if they could provide something else for you. I haven't done this personally just because I already know I want their pork dumplings. I do order something else to try alongside my dumplings just so I'm not too biased.   I have tried three of their fruit smoothies, and you can tell that they actually are drinks made from actual fruit. None of that powder stuff.   Staff members are attentive and give amazing service..which is rare at a chinese restaurant. The boss already recognized me my second visit, so their dumplings + the recognition makes me keep coming here."}
{"text":"It's my friend, celebration to be honest, they offered us free lunch Cause it's complimentary the waiter said, but we gave tips as how much we ate I like fried rice, and the tofu. A yummy delicious taste I will definitely come back again for another lunch."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing. They are super friendly. The food is delicious, made fresh, and the portions are larger than you expect. I highly recommend this place. Try one of their 99 flavors of Boba Fruit Smoothies, you will love those. Stop reading this review and go there and eat."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister for dinner! We got the matcha green tea smoothie, and passion fruit tea with boba, both which tasted great. To eat, we got crab rangoons and sesame chicken. Flavor is awesome and cooked well. Also, the service is so nice! Overall, a great place for smoothies and food :)"}
{"text":"The decor inside is nice and clean. The staff is very friendly. The food is fresh, delicious and the boba is amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious, divine dumplings with perfect skins, tons of filling, and a great price. At $7/8-piece order, available in three varieties and three cooks (pan-fried, in soup, or steamed), they are easily the highlight here. The basa fish variety with leeks and ginger are subtle but better steamed than in the soup, which I found bland. The pork and cabbage is best pan-fried to juicy, textured perfection.  But dumplings aren't all they do well here, the more traditional Chinese dishes are also a success. The half roast duck is a generous portion, with a lightly crisped skin and moist, flavorful meat, complemented by a thick, sweet house-made sauce. Lighten up your meal with a side of the garlic eggplant or Chinese broccoli. Will be coming back for garlic spinach, mapa tofu, and Chinese seafood gumbo (the dumplings are a given).  If the food isn't enough to draw you in, this is also a solid place to snag a smoothie or boba: they have 100 options to pick from, and you get a free small on your first visit with Yelp check in! The specialty options with multiple fruits sound to be the best, they even feature an avocado-black sesame version."}
{"text":"My first time eating here, and all I can say is it a fantastic place. The entrees are delicious, the hosts friendly and attentive. The boba is the best ! The super large sized boba is $4.95 which is phenomenal. Definitely trying this place again, and eating my favorite BBQ pork chops (:"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery to our hotel room in the strip. The food was great and our delivery guy was super nice and apologetic for the long wait(45-60minutes). I definitely recommend the sesame chicken and the Mongolian beef. The pork and cabbage dumplings were okay. The food was great but overall, the service is what really boosted my review to five stars."}
{"text":"If there is one place you go for Chinese food, let this be the place! It was so delicious! First you should know that Google maps has the pin wrong...it's actually tucked away on the back corner (Decatur side) of smiths. Anyhow...restaurant was clean, service was great, food was amazing. We started with the BBQ pork. I asked for a side of hot mustard but in all actuality it wasn't even necessary. We shared Kung pao chicken and orange beef. The kung pao chicken had all FRESH veggies which is a big deal to me. The beef dish was perfect! Not a lot of breading and just enough spicy. As a treat we also ordered a smoothie...mango passion fruit I believe? It was a perfect dessert (which we enjoyed throughout the meal). Today I have told at least 5 friends about this place today and I will tell more.   I can't wait to return! High fives and two thumbs up for Cheerful House."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great dumplings, duck, smoothies, and salt and pepper pork chop. Couldn't get enough of the pork chops! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Ordered yung zhou fried rice and teriyaki beef bowl. I can honestly say the vegetables in the dish was very fresh and prepared just right. However the fried rice was lack of flavor and the beef bowl was just some beef covered with regular teriyaki sauce on top of lots of steam rice for almost $9....not worth the money. They do have a very extensive menu of drinks that you can choose from. Compared with other Chinese restaurants we have been to, this place would not be on top of my list."}
{"text":"Nice folks who run this place, so I'll start with the positive:  Great Thai tea (Yelpers get a free small smoothie or one of a huge variety of other teas and smoothies with check-in).  We bought a second Thai tea because the first one was so good!  The hot and sour soup was actually pretty good, too, but no wontons to go with, so eating it just felt a little lonesome somehow.   Thus ends the positive portion of my review:  I would not revisit for the food. I love dumplings dearly, they would probably be part of my last meal if I was on death row, but these (though the folks there clearly took pains and lots of time to make them to order) were just not good. We ordered the pork and cabbage dumplings, a standard really, as we cook them all the time at home.  These were huge (lots of food, so not a bad value...) but tasted sickly and were an odd salmon color. We left that plate unfinished.  The other dishes we ordered to go with (calamari with XO sauce and kung pao shrimp) were also sadly sub-par and smothered with huge chunks of bell peppers.   I wish these guys the very best going forward, and I make my comments here only in the hope that they can improve their food offerings because they are clearly trying hard, but I don't think I would be able to make this journey again, it was just a way wrong turn for us as lovers of Chinese food (and especially dumplings)."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mongolian beef sesame chicken combination fried rice and calamari. Everything was good EXCEPT the calamari it was hard couldn't even taste the calamari and if you did it was rubbery. Overall the sesame chicken was the best thing about the meal."}
{"text":"Finally some decent broccoli and beef !! Nom nom nom. I thought the general saus was good but my bf would have preferred it spicier (probably his mistake for not ordering it that way). Best egg drop soup I've ever had. Pan fried noodle with BBQ chicken and sesame chicken was good! Got two smoothies (cucumber and mango) that were refreshing and delicious. Gave us plenty of rice and it was also tasty. Only complaints are that the egg drop soup had completely spilled into the bag from the container so they might want to rethink their containers and that they were stingy on the sweet and sour sauce that came with their yummy egg rolls."}
{"text":"The Skinny: delicious pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings which squirt juice in your mouth! The stir-fried dishes we ordered was good as well(4) service is excellent! (5) value: pretty good for a fast casual joint. (4.5 stars).  FYI, this restaurant is tucked away in the same Plaza as the Smith's across from i-naba.   Okay. I'll be honest. I was a bit skeptical with all the Crab Rangoon,  moo goo gai pan, Sesame chicken on the menu. But I must admit,  underneath it all? This place has some legit Chinese food.  First of all,  their dumplings are not listed on their regular menu. They have basa fish,  vegetarian, and pork with Napa cabbage. You have 3 styles -  in soup,  steamed and pan-fried. All made in house and 8 dumplings will set you back $6.95.  The pork and cabbage dumplings pan fried were our starters and boy, are they good! Literally the juice from the vegetables and pork squirt into your mouth as you bite into them. The wrapper was not too thick to detract from the filling inside. Delicious and tasted just like the ones we make at home.   The basa fish dumplings (with leeks and ginger) we tried were also very good which we tried in soup. The flavor of the soup was okay but the main attraction,  the dumplings,  were pretty flavorful.   We tried the braised tofu dish and the steamed eggplant with garlic ($8.50 each).   The hubs loved the braised tofu. We appreciated the fact the dish had good wok hai and was not overly sauced like most Chinese joints. (Good Chinese stir-fried dishes should not be sitting in goopy sauce. End of story.) The water chestnuts were a bit weird for me but other than that the dish was well constructed and tasted great.   I really liked the steamed eggplant dish with garlic. I never thought to just steam it like fish and serve it with soy sauce. It eliminates the amount of oil normally used to cook eggplant and tastes much healthier. The eggplant texture was pillowy soft and fabulous. Will have to try this at home.   We also received two free smoothies per the Yelp check in promotion they have. The hubs got the green tea while I got the black sesame. Both were good but really for me the dumplings/food are the bigger attraction.   Service was excellent,  friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean and spacious, making it good for families. FYI, Monday to Friday, they do have lunch specials featuring Chinese American type food for $7.95 and set menus as well. As a more casual restaurant,  they do not have a large extensive menu like other Chinese restaurants do. However of what they do have, they execute very well.   In reality, the thing that excites me about this place are the more traditional dishes they have here. Will definitely be back for more dumplings and to try other dishes. 4.5 starred review."}
{"text":"I would like to say that the staff knows customer relations management, which is what all restaurant should understand. The server definitely took care of us. I don't get many good customer service in an Asian restaurant so I really applaud to this one.   Ambience is good. Looks clean. Food was good. Their fruit smoothies are really good. They have I think over 100 flavors. I can't remember.   Plenty of parking spots. No need to worry about parking. Located at the Smiths shopping center."}
{"text":"By far, the best dumpling in town.  Enjoyed all dishes that we had and the service?  Very gracious!  Highly recommend to visit and try the dumplings."}
{"text":"Phenomenal delicious food, world class service, Gary is definitely a Go-Giver, and if you don't know the meaning, look up the book! Thoroughly enjoyed our meal, they stayed open later just for us, and still provided fresh hot food. Can't think of a better Chinese restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Why am I not surprised this place closed?   We ordered dinner for delivery at our hotel while there on vacation during Christmas and New Year.   Looking at the reviews, we were hopeful. Like very hopeful! Fast forward approximately one hour.   Gary, the General Manager, met the hubby in the lobby to pay for our meal. Obviously there wasn't an opportunity for inspection. Needless to say part of our order was missing and what was delivered was absolutely horrendous.   I called immediately and another gentleman answered. He said hold on let me call Gary. He gets back on the phone and said Gary didn't answer his cell. We agreed he'd have Gary call when he got back.   Gary calls and I start explaining everything. He was apologetic about the food quality and the missing part of our order. He said he was going to refund me for several items ASAP, like that minute. Ok, thank you. Part with no hard feelings, right? I mean crap happens, right?   Refund never happened, phone calls never returned and of course they're out of operation now!   Thank you Gary! You are the epitome of poor customer service and it's probably best you're closed...My guess, you guys will reopen under the same name and plaster a nice, cute little sign stating something like, UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT...Often times, it's just the ploy to get customers back in the door without rectifying previous issues."}
{"text":"Called in to place and order for delivery. I was amazed at how nice and helpful the man on the phone was. He spoke English perfectly and helped me with my dietary restrictions. (No meat, only fish). Usually it's hard to find things without chicken or beef stock hidden in dishes, there's a language barrier, or else servers don't know the ingredients of the dishes. But this man was perfect! He made a corn soup for me and helped me order the Hong Kong Style noodles I wanted. Right before hanging up he convinced me to order the dumplings and explained that was their specialty. Great up sell- I felt confident he was going to make my dumplings without meat. The man on the phone was also the delivery driver.   The food came in less then 35 mins and the dumplings were the best! Some kind of seafood and were perfectly crispy on the outside and when you took a bite the juices exploded. My favorite.   The Hong Style noodles are what most places call \"pan fried noodles\" with the gravy on top. I wish the noodles were fried a little less but I'm being picky. The Chinese broccoli in the noodle sauce was cooked perfectly with still some crunch.   None of the food was overly greasy or make me heavy or sick like other Chinese food. I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Came back for the dumplings.  The soup broth was much better and the fish dumplings are still the best in the soup broth.  Also had the steamed shrimp dumplings and the fried pork and cabbage dumplings and both were excellent as well.   I brought my family and one of my coworkers who ordered the duck entree which was so delicious.  The portion was big.  The meat was moist and the skin was crispy.    The only entree that was just okay was the beef chow fun in soy sauce.  The noodles were chopped up into one inch pieces and I'd prefer if the noodles weren't like that.   Gary was still there to serve us and did an excellent job at that.  At the time of check-in, there were still offers for free boba tea.  Yum."}
{"text":"Cheerful house is hit and miss.   We came here with the prior knowledge of Yelp reviewers so were able to order appropriately.  The salt and pepper wings were excellent!! The chicken curry and Roti was also very good. We were not huge fans of the beef curry and rice that we ordered. The Kung pow chicken was intolerably sweet and not at all good.  Overall, for the price we had a good meal and will be back for another try."}
{"text":"It's nice to have an authentic Chinese restaurant that serves boba tea and delivers too! When the temperatures are sky rocketing above 100+, let them deliver to you in the comfort of your own home. The size of my boba drink was one of the biggest I've seen in Vegas. They don't skimp and all the fruit smoothies are made w/ real fruit! They serve a variety of Chinese dishes too. The only bad thing is that they are pretty hidden in the corner of the smiths shopping center. Don't let that discourage you to try it out. It's truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef and Cashew Chicken was delicious! Strawberry Watermelon smoothie was also yummy! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas once or twice a year and although food option change often, I get tired of eating on the strip.  Tonight I'm so glad we ordered in! 1( they delivered to hotel, 2) fast delivery 3) great service, 4) great price & 5) excellent food!   I chose Cheerful House because of the seaweed, tofu chowder. Not really a chowder more like a very hearty miso with yummy broth, seaweed that was tasty and firm and a lot of it. So good and super filling. Loved the flavor! It has a mild flavor for the Americanized pallet so it shouldn't scare you off with seaweed and tofu in the name.  Easily spiced up also!  Completely delicious and completely gone!  Also had the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce. Fresh! Prepared perfectly.   The portions are big so I didn't try the mapo tofu that we ordered also, but it's on the menu for breakfast.  Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place. I hope it does well because I only get to Vegas once or twice a year and this is a must stop for all future trips! Morning after! The mapo  tofu is so good. I usually don't go with mapo because the tofu is soft but if was so good. Love the mapo sauce."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their food, cleanliness and modern menu. The staff are very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions. They have lunch specials for $7.95 from 11-4pm. Food was yummy. Loved the salt and pepper shrimp shell off with a bit of smile. It was so crispy!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. The beef brocolli was very savory. Tried a fruit smoothie and it was very good. You could taste the fresh fruit."}
{"text":"I have to deduct a star after the third visit to the restaurant due to inconsistencies in the cooking of the food.  This was our first time eating dinner here on a somewhat busy night.  It took a moment for the food to arrive but they did check up on us to let us know what was going on, which I appreciated.  When the sweet & sour pork came out, instead of that super thin, crispy, light coating, we had large pieces of meat that was thickly coated and some pieces were therefore harder to chew through.  Still the flavors were there.  The salt & pepper pork chop usually has a light dusting of the peppers, but this time it looked like mountain of pepper and it was very hard to eat as someone who cannot eat level 10 spiciness.  They did apologize and removed it from our check in the end.  I love this place still, and I hope that those kinks are fixed quickly.  We decided to come at lunch time instead of dinner during the weekday when it's a bit quieter.  I won't stop eating here, mind you.  I'll just watch them improve."}
{"text":"Great little spot for essential chines food. Ordered the roast duck and a few appetizers and everything was done extremely well for the prices. The duck was crispy and juicy and the service was friendly and helpful. The dumplings were made fresh and I recommend the pork and cabbage. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly customer service and the food is excellent. They served the best looking and best tasting mapo tofu I've ever had. The dumplings are also made in-house so they won't skimp out on quality for anything."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I came here because I am searching for great pork fried dumplings.  Cheerful House certainly did not disappoint in that department.  The dumplings were meaty, juicy, fresh, and tasty.  For the dumplings, I give this restaurant a higher rating.  However, I also ordered some sweet and sour pork which I did not think was great.  The dish seemed below par in terms of quality and amount of effort put into to making as compared to the freshly-made dumplings.  As far as a local Chinese restaurant to order out from, Joyful House is very solid.  The prices are comparable and most dishes hover around the $8-$15 range (usual Chinese prices).  They have takeout and are close to my house so I will be back to try other main dishes, but they are just average so far (apart from the dumplings)."}
{"text":"Saturday night & the restaurant had 2 other people eating dinner... not a good sign.  We ordered the Family Dinner for 2.  We ordered Egg Drop Soup and the waiter brought out Hot & Sour Soup.  He graciously exchanged it for the correct soup.  We asked for crispy noodles - they did not have any \"yet\".  We asked for low sodium soy sauce and were told that they only have regular soy sauce.  We were still eating our soup when the egg roll, shrimp and crab rangoon arrived.  Each appetizer was fine but nothing special.  While still getting through the soup & apps, out came an order of Lemon Chicken.  Hmmm, we ordered Orange Beef and Cashew Chicken.  OK, they took away the wrong chicken and brought the Orange Beef.  This dish was prepared nicely, if a bit overly sweet & sauced heavily.  The Cashew Chicken arrived next and we asked about our fried rice, which really should have been served at the same time as the main dishes.  It was brought out a few minutes later and really was the highlight of the meal.  Disjointed kitchen/wait staff, average food, decent atmosphere.  Not enough for us to return."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of good reviews. They seem new? Since when we went there, it was pretty empty. I have to say, the food is delicious. The dumplings are pretty well made. The roasted duck was crispy and flavorful. They use fresh fruits on their boba. We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Order it for the second time this week. Definitely satisfy my Chinese craving that I must have more! Everything is extremely tasty! When I ordered the seafood pan fried noodles, I was expecting ...some shrimp but as soon as I opened that box, KaPOW!-an assortment of seafood in every bite! The crab ragoons are an addiction. They did forget my cookie ...but I will forgive them, this time!"}
{"text":"Their food is so delicious and the customer service is attentive and relaxing!   Try their boba, too! YUM-YUM-YUMMA'S and it is FRESH. Not that powder stuff you usually get from boba places. I will definitely be returning.   Also, they deliver. Gah, how AWESOME. Hope this place stays open and never leaves."}
{"text":"First time trying this place tonight got a order for delivery very fast I Order sweet and sour soup AMAZINGGGGGG, as well with the King pao chicken combo that was okay. Didn't care too much for it , it was more on the sweeter side and I like mine more on the spicy side.  But I'd def order from this place and try something different but will be order that soup again for sure."}
{"text":"It was dead tonight and the service wss very slow, the won ton noodle soup had NO flavor at all and the orange chicken was practically all breading. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars. The beer was very overpriced also. Overall, not good at all and never coming back."}
{"text":"We travel a lot and often rely on yelp to find places to eat. We came across Cheerful House and thought the reviews sounded good. We got here and were immediately seated. The staff was super kind and courteous. The dining room was spotless. My husband ordered shrimp fried rice and I ordered vegetable fried rice. I don't eat eggs, so they made sure to leave them out for me. The kids got sweet and sour chicken and rice. They're also picky, so they asked for sauce on the side, and the staff was kind enough to do that as well, with no issue. We ordered a few of the smoothies, which were fantastic. They met yet another request and used soy milk for mine. Throughout the entire time we were there, we were checked on numerous times and the waiter was super friendly, even to the kids. We felt as if the entire staff really cared about their business and their customers. We're sad that we live hundreds of miles away, because if we were local this would be our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Best dumplings. The basa fish dumplings are amazing. Watch out for the juice. Sprayed me good. Got the fried noodles with beef. Lots of bran sprouts for a good texture balance. Great food. Nice people. Good place to eat"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family 3 kids (2 toddlers) and 2 adults. Not crowded and not cramped, nice big and clean. The food was better than average for a Chinese place. But the Honey walnut shrimp could use more sauce so order extra. The dumplings were awesome, hand made from scratch which u can taste. The duck was juicy but not too fatty, the flavor was perfect not too salty. Ordered the Singapore rice noodles, be careful it's got a kick which I didn't expect but I like spicy but some might get surprised by it. We also got some of their smoothies with boba. 1 free small smoothie with a check in on YELP! We ordered coconut-lychee: a little on the sweet side with coconut jelly along with boba. The coffee-vanilla was delish, perfect dessert drink. The taro smoothie had good flavor if u don't mind a slight grainy texture of taro. All in all bill came out to $60 with tax & Tip. Not bad for the amount of variety and food we got. Try them out! And get your free (choice of 50 flavors) smoothie!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Finally a place that has authentic FRESH dumplings..handmade every morning! Now, if you know me you know I'm a dumpling whore and always on the hunt for a new Chinese restaurant. This place is spot on!"}
{"text":"Dumplings coming in hot!  I haven't tried anything else here since im not big on chinese food; however, i do love me some fat, delicious dumplings.  Whether it be Mandoo, Gyoza, or Potstickers as long as it's pork and cabbage i'm all for it.    I tried both Pan Fried and Steamed Pork Dumplings here.  Both delicious but steamed is more up my alley because I don't feel as guilty loading up on the chili oil and dipping sauce.  Actually steamed is not any much healthier, but i do subconciously feel better about it.   But man, pan fried is soo good too.  The wrapping has an attractive deep yellow crisp on one side and the fillings stuffed with juicy fragrance.  Favorite dumplings in town.  Even better than mom's, oh whaaaa? Who said that?  It's better to dine in than to take out as they lose their integrity.  Either way you'll be leaving a lot more cheerful than you were before you came in.  Don't forget to grab some of fruit / boba milk tea.  They use real ingredients here.  Gary is the man!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident on google.  Everything looked so good and they delivered! So I decided to give it a shot.  I really liked it the dumplings weren't quite what I thought, but still tasty.  I would definitely order from them again for my Chinese cravings"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed overall. I made an order for delivery just a few minutes before closing. They delivered my food pretty quickly, about 35 min, and I was happy they took the late order.   The veg egg rolls where decent, little did I know they would be the best part of the meal. Next I had the hot and sour soup. This is the first time I ever ordered this soup but it was a cold night and sounded good :( it was hot in temperature and that was about it. The flavor was bland and I didn't like the consistency. Unfortunately after 2-3 bites I couldn't eat anymore. I followed up with general Taos chicken. Not the most authentic dish but one that I like to get down on when I'm feeling naughty. Tasted like the chicken was fried in the fish batter. The chicken quality was questionable and again after a few bites I decided it wasn't worth the calories.   Overall I was very disappointed which is too bad because the late night (9:45) delivery was a nice option."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The Chinese cuisine here is incredibly authentic and at amazing prices. The best part about this restaurant though is the super nice/helpful staff.   I highly recommend the steamed or broth shrimp dumplings, they are so tender and juicy. Another fave is the seafood Hong Kong noodles and seared scallops. Oh yeah, they also make fresh smoothies with or without boba!  Overall a great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Went here today with my daughter and WOW!! Their smoothie are larger than most places and the flavor for all 4 of our smoothies were very pleasing to the palette. . Being a former chef and tasted volcano tea or now café. .also Kung fu tea house and this place has them beat with flavor.  Their Boba cooked perfect and definitely will come back!! They also serve food . Can't wait to try it..very nice setting too. Possible father's day dining this weekend..."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! Great service, very friendly ! The food  was fresh and tasty. Go and show them some love !"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food with attentive service. Get a smoothie, you won't be sorry! Fast lunch service. Tasty lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp I decided to check this little joint out and let me tell you, it was great! The service was exceptional! The waiter was very attentive and even recommended their dumplings to us as one of their most popular dishes. We decided to try them out and they did not disappoint. They came with their signature sauces as well. We also ordered the crab rangoons which were average but nothing too great and the sesame chicken. Overall the food was good but the service is really what made this place awesome!"}
{"text":"The dining area at Cheerful House is spacious and clean. I greatly appreciate how clean the tables are. Pictures of the food decorate the walls. That is cool, sometimes you just want to see the food before you order it and the food here comes out looking as it does in the pictures.   Dumplings, dumplings, and more dumplings. Fish, Shrimp, Pork and cabbage, and the occasional special dumplings. You can have them pan fried, steamed, or in soup. They all taste great and come to you hot.   I am a big fan of the Sweet & Sour Pork here. The pork was very tender and well seasoned with a nice crisp exterior. Not a piece of gristle in the batch. The sauce was elegant with an excellent balance between the sweet and sour. Nothing overly sweet like the neon red sauce found in many other establishments. I am going to have to try the other protein options with this sauce.   Honey Walnut Shrimp. I remember seeing this item pop up on a Chinese menu for the first time. It was a curious combination of ingredients but it worked and I have liked it ever since. Cheerful House does this dish right.  The customer service is as excellent as the food. Friendly and informative, our interaction with our server was very enjoyable.   Cheerful House reminds me of my favorite Chinese restaurant when I was a child. As time went by and management changed, so did the flavors. One bite of the Sweet & Sour Pork at Cheerful House instantly brought me back to those memories of that first Chinese restaurant. I have found my favorite Chinese restaurant at Cheerful House and I can not wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was slow. I would recommend coming here when it's not busy. Or getting take out."}
{"text":"New kid in town and worth it! Pick your favorite or go for the family meal. We picked family meal A and loved it! Hot and sour soup was perfect! Just the right amount of hot and sour. Also picked the beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and general chow chicken. All great flavors and bathed in rich sauces. One tiny issue, general chick was a little too fried, but we didn't mind too much. They also have 40+ smoothies. Yum!!!! And last but not least the price is right with entrees at $12 ish!"}
{"text":"We came back on a Saturday during lunch, not very busy, just a few tables by the time we ordered. Food came out very fast but was very disappointed that the cooking seemed to have gone downhill. My daughter ordered the crab rangoon, it came out over fried and the wonton skin was dark brown, almost burnt. It was very obvious but the waiter did not seem to want to notice. The lunch special General Tso chicken was really hard to bite into, it seemed to have been cooked a long time ago and was just re-fried with some sauce slopped over it...it was bad. The chicken fried rice was rice that was clumped together and brown with soy sauce like what you usually get from most cheap Chinese take out but at $9, it was totally not cool. Chicken Chow Mein was just too oily. The only thing that was kind of good was the pot stickers. Our little lunch was over $50 and for the quality of what we had I could have had better from Panda Express and much cheaper, no kidding. We left most of our food uneaten and did not even want to take it home. Sad to see the somewhat having potential Cheerful House going downhill so soon."}
{"text":"This time I ordered Beef Chow Fun..which not alot of Chinese restaurants have. And it was to die for delicious. Didnt even have to add salt. Very on point..I ordered it take out..now I can divide it into 3 meals..yummm!  Great sevice and very clean....try this place..its sooooooo worth it!  Oh love their sauces..the chinese mustard is to die for..you just want to drink it.. I sware!"}
{"text":"Love the casual environment with neighborhood service. So awesome they deliver too. So much selection for here for clean healthy Chinese food"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner with my fiance. The food was excellent (I got the pan fried noodles with shrimp and he got the chicken chop suey) and the staff was awesome. Our server was constantly refilling our water and asking us if we were satisfied. He even let us hang out after we finished eating and still refilled our water. Great service, and I look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, fast delivery, delicious food! Highly recommend this location it was way better then any other locations we have previously ordered from."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Chinese food, the dumpling is good, and their fruit smoothies are awesome! Oh and the stuff are really friendly and very welcoming.. Well come back!"}
{"text":"This is the first and only Chinese restaurant I've been to that has great customer service. They offer suggestions and have great manners.   Food is also amazing. Come to California!"}
{"text":"authentic chinese cuisine!..      i tried their made to order pork and cabbage dumplings together with their mouth watery chili oil sauce and it was just the perfect combination that just totally satisfied are palates. And my husband fell in love with their chili oil sauce that they gave us free chili sauce to go. how nice of a gesture.        With their fruit smoothies, they make it with REAL, FRESH fruits which is healthy and delicious.        Their customer service was excellent! They really took care of you and would entertain you frequently. The owner was really friendly.        I would definitely be back and i totally recommend this to everyone that loves to indulge on such great chinese comfort food."}
{"text":"The restaurant really recommended the dumplings...  And for good reason!  Tremendous.  Had the cabbage and pork dumplings,  and they were spectacular.  Had the lunch special which was very filling and had appetizers with it.  The sesame chicken was some of the best I've had in a long while.  Can't speak highly enough of the amazing service.  Primo!  Definitely worth coming for."}
{"text":"After a long day exploring the Strip, and craving Chinese food,  I found this place on Yelp! I saw they had excellent reviews and was very close to our location.  After finding it hidden in the parking lot,  we walked in and we're surprised by how clean the restraunt was. We were immediately greeting and welcomed inside,  once we sat down I redeemed my free smoothie,  and it was so amazing I bought 2 more for the rest of the family.    Me and my wife decided on fried rice,  I got shrimp and she chose vegetable...  They were so considerate and prepared her food to her specifications perfectly.    Hands down the best Chinese food I have had in years."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for the dumplings due to rave reviews. The pork and cabbage dumplings were okay. I thought it was bland. The shrimp dumplings were a surprise...I questioned if it had any shrimp in it since they were over powered by the ground meat inside. The pan-fried dumplings lacked a crisp. I preferred the steamed ones more.   Beef chow fun in black bean sauce was 3 stars okay. The flavor was not as rich as I had expected. The beef in it was very tender and juicy, and quite enjoyable.   Mabo tofu- good, but maybe I hardly get blown away by this dish as a general item. It was underwhelming when it was first served, so we asked them to make it look more like the photo. The owner was super cool and remade this dish, which was a significant improvement.   Fried calamari- was not bad either. Good stuff.   Sesame chicken- good. Nice crunch and chicken was tender.   They have an endless selection for their smoothies with boba. I got to try 5 different ones, and I gotta, say the cantaloupe was my favorite, with black sesame coming in second.   Great service, owner is super nice, and very clean. We got a real kick out of the koi fish paper posters in the frames. I may be back, but will try more of the authentic dishes that others have reviewed."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! Best dumplings in town. House-made dough and fillings! I loved everything else we ordered too - roast duck, ma po tofu, yang zhou fried rice, and beef chow fun. As if that wasn't enough, you get a free smoothie with Yelp check in, huge selection (I had black sesame, delicious!). Thank you Gary! I will be back and I will tell everyone I know to come see you!"}
