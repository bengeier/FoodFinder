{"text":"While shopping for gifts to take on an upcoming journey, the lady at Ortega's jewelry highly recommended the Carefree Bistro.  Being hungry, we decided to give it a try.  SOOOOOO glad we did!  I had the \"Parisian omelette.\"  It is misnamed.  Nothing I ate in Paris was this good.  Irene ordered the French toast.  We shared both directions, and both meals were superb.  Presentation was beautiful.  And oh yes, the home made bread is fantastic!  Add great service, and you have a wonderful dining experience, which is exactly what we had.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner last night! The food, the wine, and the service were exceptional. Came in late with a group of ten and they were happy to have us and took excellent care of us. We had a variety of items and everything was delicious-chef is very talented. Will definitely look forward to another meal here."}
{"text":"The food was soooo fresh and light, which allowed the flavors of the fresh ingredients to show them selves. We had lunch, the Greek salad, a beet salad and tuna tar tar. 5 thumbs up to this gem in the north valley."}
{"text":"The food was tasteless - our table ordered carrot soup because it looked good at the next table.  No flavor, we had to ask for salt & pepper.  My salad also had no taste, the dressing was all oil, no seasonings.  Very disappointed as we don't get to Carefree often."}
{"text":"Did not know this place was even there till they put up the brunch sign so decided to check it out. All the meals were cooked to perfection. The godfather pizza had absolutely nothing to complain about. The risotto was deliciously creamy. Our waiter throughly knew the menu and what to recommend. Highly recommended for a more formal and traditional Italian resturant."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant, and good service. But overpriced, our pork chop was overcooked and risotto too fishy."}
{"text":"Wow!!! It can't get much worse then this!!! 
Let me start with the good. The remodeling done on the place was great! I love the open kitchen, so you can see the cooks in action. Also, the atmosphere was great! That is where all the good stops and the bad comes in. 

There were only 3 small tables of people, when we first entered. After being seated, we waited over 15 minutes before someone even acknowledged our existence. As people started to pack in and noticing there was only 2 wait staff, we knew we were in for the long haul. Our thoughts became a reality when over 30 minutes past and still no food and we only ordered 2 pizzas! Finally when we did receive our pizzas..........

This is not pizza!!!! This is not even close to a pizza......How can you screw pizza up this bad!!!!! I have eaten pizza from all over the world (Pizza Bianco being my favorite) and this did not even come close to a decent pizza. Now, don't get me wrong! It wasn't as bad as Brugo's pizza up the street (worst pizza ever tasted) it was a very close second! The only thing more upsetting then this slop they call pizza was the bill!!! Run From This Place!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place in an out-of-the-way town. The fresh mozzarella sandwich was absolutely amazing. If I find myself in Arizona again I'd definitely go back for that. Nice wine selection as well. We showed up at an off time in the middle of the week, and the service was attentive and polite."}
{"text":"We have been here several times before and it has always been fine. we brought a friend/client here tonight and were very disappointed with the service. Our waiter was great as always,  but was required to do everything.\" - bartending as well. Took forever to get our drinks, also our bread, And the restaurant was NOT crowded. Clearly, they needed more help. When this negativity precedes the meal, the experience suffers. Get the drinks and bread out and things might go smoother from there. Hopefully, we can try it again?"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday afternoon  with a friend and had a great meal.  They did a great makeover of this restaurant.  The food is is fresh and delish.  We had a Margarita pizza and a veggie sandwich and they were both outstanding.  Also gave us some of their homemade bread which I had with olive oil, oh my! Looking forward to dinner in here soon.  I have heard the lamb chops are awesome! Ben was great waiter and very helpful answering questions about menu and restaurant."}
{"text":"So service is good. Their pizzas are amazing and you can tell the ingredients are fresh... so why 3 stars? I ordered their prawns once. It was around $14. It was VERY small. And what I got weren't even prawns. They were very small shrimps!!!! I am a seafood fanatic so I know what prawns are supposed to look like. There were only literally 5 shrimps too. SMALL SHRIMPS. Not even large ones. I felt really cheated on portion size AND the cost. But other than that... so far the others are decent."}
{"text":"Bravo! Hats off to the Chef and our Server Marty!! Exceptionally fresh food from the cauliflower soup and Caprese salad starter to the Ravioli - can't find the words to thank you for an amazing meal. A definite favorite and one I am eager to return too."}
{"text":"I reviewed Carefree Bistro in January and swore I would never go back, however, there was a function we attended and Carefree Bistro is where they had lunch. I'm glad they did, it forced us to give them another chance which we wouldn't have done otherwise.  

Everything was great and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Today we returned again and were very happy with the food and the portions.  My husband had the ahi tuna salad, the portion was perfect, the salad included avocado and a hard boiled egg, and he couldn't have been happier! We are glad the chef / owners have made improvements and hope to visit many more times in the future."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED!  ITS GONE!!  Had reservation on Sat. Night and got there to find it closed. Others arrived with same deal, reservations and its CLOSED!!"}
{"text":"Really impressed on our initial visit here. The decor is fresh and pleasing, service is cheerful and attentive and as for the food - exquisitely presented, superbly cooked and generous yet elegant portions. It's not often I rave about hummus.... :-) We tried it, as well as the tuna tartare, the lamb skewer ( served with the most perfect vegetables) and the beet salad. All exceptional."}
{"text":"Humus and crab risotto was fabulous!!! Wonderful service too!!:) Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We tried to dine here a couple of weeks ago. I say \"tried\" because their menu looked really good and the atmosphere looked cozy. But, we had a terrible waiter!  I asked for a simple modification of no sauce on the vegetables that accompanied the entree I ordered. He flat out said \"no, they couldn't do that\"!!  What?  What restaurant cannot serve a vegetable without sauce?  I asked again thinking he didn't understand my request but again he said the chef would not do that. Once more I clarified asking \"you don't have any vegetables without a sauce on them?\"  Clearly, he did not want to accommodate me and therefore we left and took our business elsewhere. Furthermore, I emailed the owner to express my disappointment and I thought he'd appreciate knowing what type of wait staff he has and how they treat their customers. No response!!  Super disappointed and we will never return."}
{"text":"went for a nice family dinner here during the holidays and was overwhelmed & disgusted by the SMELL in this place! it literally smells like a sulfer leak or a slow honey bucket leak directly into the bar. our waiter was definitely unresponsive to our observations (actually, he just blatantly ignored us)... 
we would have left immediately had there been any availability elsewhere (but, we'd made a reservation here & needed a highchair for our baby neice, so we were pretty stuck!) 
save you & your loved ones a gross adventure and do NOT come here!"}
{"text":"Best hummus in town. This must try restaurant has it all - the food, the ambiance and the owners are lovely. I will sure to come back and recommend to all my friends and colleagues. I've tried the trio and the risotto and my friend had the salmon. It all was delicious and unique. Great service and beautiful views at the patio. If you're looking for a Mediterranean style place to eat you know where to go."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.  Food was delicious!  Bar for happy hour only seats four but we were told they are getting ready to remodel entire restaurant .  Dinner of salmon Wellington was wonderful.  Love this little gem.  Carefree needs more places like this!  We will be repeat costumes!"}
{"text":"Had appetizers and drinks.  Staff was friendly and gave good service.  Had the Caprese salad which was the best I ever had hands down. Expensive but excellent quality."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent lunch here. My husband had the asparagus soup and the ahi salad. He loved both. I had the veal meatball sandwich, delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch yesterday and found it closed.  It appeared from the signage that it is permanently closed.
it had such an interesting menu we were really looking forward to trying it. This is the second place we tried to go to and found it closed.  I wish owners of an out of business place would remove it from yelp."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner with friends last night. Food quality and service was outstanding!!  We arrived 15 minutes before closing and they accommodated our 10 person party. Highly recommended. Chef was top notch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is modern with a relaxed vibe. Our server was Fabio and definitely made our lunch more enjoyable. The pizza was amazing along with the seared tuna salad. Going to be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We came at the end of the evening and the place was emptied out.  We were made to feel welcome and had an excellent dinner.  I'd go back, for sure."}
{"text":"Atmosphere on the patio was nice as it was quiet. Service was good. But that's only half the experience. The other important part was the food! 

I was expecting more from the food, from the way people had been raving about it online. I had the fish special and I found it to be over salted, I couldn't taste anything on the dish except the overwhelming salt, we ordered truffle fries and tartar for the table -- the truffle fries tasted like regular fries and didn't look homemade at ALL -- Which is what was touted to us as we sat down to the table. The tartar looked really dark, I was a little leery as to why, I was hoping it was because of a marinade or dressing they had put on it. The plating of the dishes were quite honestly sloppy. And two other people at my table ordered the chicken and prawns which was NOTHING spectacular or out of the ordinary. 
I have to agree with most of the people on here that say the prawns are not prawns. They are shrimp -- because if those are prawns then they should be labeled as MICRO Prawns! They looked like a 41/ 50 count medium shrimp. 

Wine selection was nice. 

I just don't see what all the fuss is about? I didn't hate it, it just missed the mark for me. Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this in Carefree!

We've been waiting for a decent restaurant to open in Carefree...looks like its finally here!!!

Last night we stopped in and were greeted by a fabulous server by the name of Thea. She was very knowledgable about the wine list, so right off we were impressed. Come to find out, Thea was the bartender at Carefree Station for 8 years before it closed. We miss Carefree Station, especially their homemade potato chips that use to be served for free at the bar! 

I digress, back to Carefree Bistro...anyway, my partner ordered salmon over beet salad and I ordered the most delicious chicken breast and shrimp dish. It arrived bathed in a delicious sauce with large caper berries and artichokes. Fresh Brussels sprouts, carrots and rosemary potatoes rounded out the meal.

It was the perfect complement to the Oaked Chardonnay that Thea recommended. 
But the piece de resistance was dessert! 
Profiteroles served with homemade chocolate gelato. 
Now THAT'S how you win my heart.

We'll be back!
NOTE: their outdoor patio is pet friendly and a nice option for those seeking gourmet food in Carefree. I don't know of a better choice in Carefree!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lamb, cooked just right. Great service. Could not have been more satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious. We had a truffle pizza and split a salad. Perfect proportions and outstanding flavor.  The staff and chef were charming and helpful in making selections.  We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"We visited tonight (Wednesday) at 5:30 with our 10 month old and 2-1/2 year old (who were well behaved!) The staff brought the oldest child a plain marguerita pizza which was gone before our main dishes arrived.  Everything went very well.

Although the bistro filled with \"adults only\" by 6:30 pm, the children were welcomed and catered to.  We had 1) sausage pasta -good; and the specials- 1) garden greens salad with pumpkin seeds, blue cheese-great; 2) veal ravioli-great; and 3) sea bass with capers and a delicious white sauce-GREAT! 

In response to the two less than positive reviews:  
1-The place is VERY OPEN (I don't know what the other review 6 days ago is talking about) and 
2-We were more than FULL , without dessert!

Wine selection was wonderful and the place was packed by 6:30-make reservations! We will return!"}
{"text":"On a whim, we decided to drop in here for dinner on Friday night. Got there at about 5:45 with no reservation and we were seated at the last non reserved table available.  By 6:30 the place was full, so I recommend reservations. Our server was Tim and he was awesome. Had the pork belly app and the surf and turf and lamb entrees. All were great. Nice to have this spot in the neighborhood. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our first visit, but it won't be our last.   Ate there on a very busy Friday night.  The restaurant and outside patio were packed.  In spite of that, our cocktail, appetizer, entrees and dessert were perfectly timed by Ramen, who was quite knowledgeable about the menu and the restaurant.  Can highly recommend the lamb meatballs, ahi tuna salad, and the pastas.  The drinks were a little high, but generously sized and delicious (manhattans and grey goose on the rocks).  Noise level was very high, so we may opt for either the patio or the bar if the Bistro is as crowded next time as it was this time.  But there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"I have very mixed emotions about this restaurant. I had a wonderful breakfast there along time ago. But recently my wife and I went to dinner there on a Friday evening. 

As we looked outside our window there was old trash in and around the cactus right outside the window. That's usually pretty good indicator that not much attention is being paid to details.

The meal was OK. The lamb chops were very good. But everything else was pretty ho-hum.

The menus were filthy and the dessert menu was absolutely disgusting. It had stains on both sides. We're talking about something that can be printed cheaply on  a laser printer at home using thick quality paper. Just not much attention to cleanliness.

When the bill was brought to us the leather folder that it was in had grease all over it. I literally had to wipe it off before I would even touch.

Overall I was very disappointed. More attention needs to be given to these sorts of things. I'm usually very very easy to please but I was rather disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate at the Carefree Bistro with my wife and parents last week, and it was a very pleasant experience. The wine list had a pretty good selection, and my wife and I were  very happy with the $35 bottle we shared (even though it was one of the least expensive bottles on the list). My parents each had white wine by the glass, and they both enjoyed their selections as well. 

To start, all four of us ordered the insalata caprese, made with perfectly softened burrata cheese. I've had a lot of caprese salads in my day, and though it's a simple dish, it can go wrong in a lot of ways. I'm happy to say that the Carefree Bistro's version is among the better ones I've had. 

My wife and I chose to order the specials -- I had the Duck Ragu with Rigatoni, and my wife had a Salmon Wellington. My mother stuck to the menu with a ravioli dish, and I can't quite remember what my father had (though I know he enjoyed it!). 

The duck ragu was actually less flavorful than I would have expected -- the duck didn't add much to the dish, and it was fairly bland. I ended up adding salt, which I generally never do. I'm not sure if the rigatoni was house-made, but it was prepared well, and the dish was otherwise well-proportioned. My wife really liked the salmon wellington, but noted that it could have used some type of vegetable side dish to relieve the palette of seafood overload (apparently it came with caviar on the side?). 
 
For dessert I ordered a mixed fruit cobbler, which was served with a scoop of house-made gelato. While my mom complained that there was not enough \"cobbler,\" I thought it was a nice balance. My wife had the coconut creme brûlée, which she simply described as \"awesome.\" 

All in all, it was a great meal with the parents, and at about $50 per person including appetizers, wine, and dessert, it was very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend the Carefree Bistro to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"The decor at this restaurant is cute contemporary.  The food was tasty but for the price I expected a little bit more.  The service was OK but not the greatest. Not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch. I had the risotto -- very good! My friends each had pizzas and both were very pleased. Cocktails were generous sizes (sangria and margaritas).  Service was excellent. Overall a great experience. Would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Busy but not over crowded on a Thursday night. Very friendly staff and owners. Positive vibe is indicative of the husband/wife owners who love meeting the restaurant patrons. 
Food and drinks were all well prepared. Moscow Mule was particularly good. In addition to the menu there are usually a few daily specials worth trying. Everything is made with fresh ingredients and tastes like it. Although menu is mostly American, there are some Turkish influences sprinkled throughout. 
Recommend finishing your meal with a proper Turkish coffee.
Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is the best, the cleanest, the most thoughtful food I've had yet in Carefree. There aren't any bad places here, but this is the best. I had the beet salad, yum. I'd have it again, but I want to try other stuff. Good chef and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Excellent place. So refreshing to eat REAL Italian.  I can't comment on dinner, we had a late lunch/brunch, ate outside,  everything was perfect. Not crowded, no rush, brought our dog, waiter was beyond charming. Just a really nice place. We will be back, and soon!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was a mixed bag. Ordered martinis to start - charged 16.50 for a Bombay Sapphire & $13.50 for a Grey Goose. Are you kidding me?? They cost less in a way better restaurant in Manhattan. The place looks like a rush renovation of a Friendly's - you wouldn't come for the ambience. Crab cakes were tasty eggplant gratin kind of mushy affair with a thick mound of ricotta whirled on top. Fish special was sole (overlooked by a mile) shrimp over red lentils. It was O K. Lamb brochettes were tasty but they said it came with risotto Milanese - not arborio rice & not prepared as you would a risotto. It was rice a roni. The bread was not Italian - it was bland. They need to learn how to make a good sponge starter for their dough. 
I'm a tourist in the area & I felt taken.  Made the reservation with open table maybe that tipped them off"}
{"text":"The Carefree Bistro is a small casual upscale restaurant that serves seasonal American food. They only serve natural fed meat, organic free range chicken and locally grown produce as much as possible. Hint hint.....that means you will be spending more because those things are quality and cost more. They offer a comfortable roomy looking bar, a stylish dining room and an outdoor dining patio.

Based on only one dining experience the main things we tried were outstanding but a few things were odd.

I had the blacked petrale sole sandwich with truffle fries. I thought it was a delicious sandwich. Lots of flavors coming though. I also thought the house made bread for my sandwich was tasty. As tasty as the house made tarter sauce was... the sandwich was covered with too much sauce so I would ask for sauces on the side next time. The fries had a similar texture to frozen fries and were fried with real truffle shavings. The fries did taste like truffle. A side of balsamic ketchup was on the plate but for my taste it didn't go with anything on the plate. 

My husband had the grilled chicken sandwich with some sort of aioli on the side. The chicken in his sandwich was so delicious it was memorable. Juicy, flavorful, the works. It had melty creamy goat cheese on it and I think some pesto. The aioli would have been overkill for either of us. 

We tried the house made prickly pear gelato for dessert. I liked that they offered such a unique flavor but for me the flavor in the gelato was very hard to identify. That means I wouldn't order it again.

For me the sandwiches were overall very good and made with high quality ingredients. I am a fan of that. 

They do over sauce the sandwiches so if that sort of thing bothers you - you need to order some of the sauces on the side.

Service was efficient."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My friend and I went for an early dinner last week.  We were told that we can only do Happy Hour in the bar area, & said that we planned on staying for dinner also, could we go out on the patio for both?  NO! Have to stay in bar area for HH.  This was at 4PM and the place was EMPTY.  We sat, ordered a drink, also wanted to order an appetizer, so after quite a wait we had to literally vocally grab his attention behind the bar (again we were the only ones there).  Later we went out on the patio, I had Risotto Special (chicken, mushrooms, beats), $30, my chicken pieces had that raw chicken taste, my friend had a prawn, chicken & vegetable dish, her chicken also tasted raw, $26.  We did not complain but should have.  Came twice to the table to take our plates, we were in no hurry, but they were.  Don't know why only 5 other people in the whole place!  Don't think I will be back"}
{"text":"I was there twice in the last 4 months even I live near Litchfield Park, Arizona and my office is on Litchfield Park & Thomas Rd. Their food is fresh, tasteful and presented like Five Star restaurant which in opinion this Carefree Bistro is five star restaurant.
Chef and Owner of this Bistro amazing and comes out to check how is your dining experience, give you warm and professional gratitude to have you in his Bistro.
You are not just a customer to him and his crew, but a special guest. And your satisfaction matters to him.  I don`t judge the restaurants by their look, price and taste, but the ambiance, quality of their products including the staff, how welcome and comfortable You feel while you are dining there and most importantly do they appreciate  my business.   
Thanks again and see you guys soon.

{"text":"We tried this restaurant again this year and what an improvement.  Very good food and an excellent wine list.  Service couldn't have been more attentive.  We are certainly repeat customers."}
{"text":"Had dinner at CB last night after a debacle at an establishment across the street.  Such a great experience wanted to update my review and realized I never have reviewed.  Yikes!  Remedying that now.

We have been to Carefree Bistro about five times since it opened and have never had a bad meal.  Always delicious, service great, super energy---probably the reason we don't go more often is we find the dining room quite loud---it's happy chatter, but it's loud.  Now that the patio is open, it's quieter and that will make a difference in our visits, I think.  But last night the patio was full, as was the dining room, but a lovely young woman found us a two-top in the corner.

We were so hungry!  We told our server we had just waited an hour and a half at a nearby restaurant and never got our meals, so please feed us fast!  I love CB's risotto and order it at every opportunity---last night was no exception.  DH ordered the Chicken & Prawns.  

Bless his heart---moments after we ordered, our server, Benjamin, brought two bowls of the most delectable cream of broccoli soup to hold us over---complimentary because we were so hungry and weren't having a great experience so far this night.  It was really, really very good.  I can't explain except it just seemed to embody broccoli flavor.  I don't know how the chef made it so intense.

But I have to point out that that gesture did not nothing but make us feel more positive about CB and it's staff than we already were.  I don't know what those soups cost, but emotionally, it made us feel someone cared what kind of evening we were having.  Priceless!

Our entrees were out in about 10 minutes.  I had a three mushroom risotto that was incredible and perfectly cooked---I didn't even allow the server to add parmesan because the seasoning was so perfectly balanced, I didn't want to adjust it with the saltiness of the cheese.  DH said his Chicken & Prawns was very good.  He gave me one of his prawns and it was delicious, hot and succulent and buttery.  Yum!  One of these days if I can pass up the risotto, I am going to try that dish myself.

Oh, and though we did not have an appetizer at CB last night, the tuna tartare and the calamari has been wonderful in the past!  The pizza looks great too---DH always says he is going to try their pizza, then he gets seduced by a entree.  Maybe we will have to go up to lunch one day...I have heard their portobello mushroom sandwich is really good!

Anyhow, as good as the food is, the attention to detail and the incredible hum of energy is probably why Carefree Bistro is always packed.  You just feel cosseted and like you are at a big ol' party all at one time!  Very nice."}
{"text":"The service was confused...forgot a glass of wine, mixed up orders, took 15 minutes to process our check.  The food was average and the prices high for the quality and atmosphere.  Salads were very average, one with both feta & blue cheese didn't really work and the caprese had tasteless tomatoes and generic mozzarella .  The lamb kabob was very skimpy on lamb...three small pieces.  The special salmon risotto  was gummy and fishy, but the spaghetti &  meatballs got a thumbs up, though slightly high priced.  Desserts were nothing special...very disappointing, and we will not go back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Brunch location. Healthy delicious menu, charming interior and friendly staff. We will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. The service was the worst I have ever had in my life. Would really appreciate the management improving that. Out of respect I won't mention the servers name but he told a member in our party who had ordered a bottle of wine to pour it himself. We had to go get our own ketchup from the kitchen. He was no where to be found. Rarely came by."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. We enjoy the food very much as well as the service. Today we both enjoyed a cup of roasted red pepper tomato soup and we split the sole sandwich. We also split the rice pudding for dessert. The pudding was good too.
Our bill was $39. My husband feels its steep. One cup of soup is included in the price of the $14 fish sandwich. I myself feel the quality Carefree Bistro serves up is well worth it!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday and really enjoyed the food and service, but found it a bit pricey. It was four star good, but we had to knock off a star for horrible water. It is hard to believe a place of this caliber does not have a filter system for drinking water, or does not at least offer a slice of lemon."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated and very friendly staff that attended to everything to make our meal experience excellent.  The dinner entrees were creative and flavorful - really excellent !    Nice bartender made extra efforts to prepare and serve our drinks.  He came over and delivered drinks himself and they were perfect.  
Our group will come back again.  I like the atmosphere here.  I hope it does well.....we like having classy, yummy options in Carefree."}
{"text":"Update 2016: GOOD NEWS. They have renovated, expanded, and the sewer smell is gone. We asked about it, and they explained it was the vacant suite next door and thy final figured it out. Whatever it was, we expect to smell it and are surprised we don't. Bryan is often our server, and he does a great job. Great recommendations, excellent service that is timely and not overbearing. As for food, we are always impressed. Our favorites include the tuna green salad, a great take on a nicoise, with crunchy green beans, sushi-grade seared tuna, and a wonderful vinaigrette. The Caesar is also great, with anchovies (as it should be). Their meatballs, chicken and shrimp, all their entrees are great. Their nightly specials are where it's at, like stuffed flank steak, or sole over mashed cauliflower. But our favorite is their mushroom pizza with truffle oil. It's off the charts, and beats the other pizza place on the other side of the sundial. Incredible. Their patio offers great views of the sunset, and we like to sit out there whenever we can, weather permitting. This is quickly earning a spot on our regular go-to rotation for local Carefree/Cave Creek restaurants."}
{"text":"Took two people for lunch today.  This little place,  owners by a husband and wife,  exceeded all my expectations.  The food was absolutely amazing.  Fresh,  flavorful and unique.  You can still get a burger or specialty pizza or spurge on their amazing pasta or lamb,  or the lightest fish I've ever tasted.  I'll come again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Carefree for a conference and decided to try something local -  best decision! Our server, Branko was absolutely pleasant and took his time with us. The bartender, Fabio was equally as friendly and made one of the best glasses of sangria I've tried! Great people. My husband tried the chicken risotto and it was so delicious! I had the mushroom pizza with red onions and it was great. I didn't get a chance to take pictures because we scarfed down everything. I highly recommend this place not only for the food, but for the people!"}
{"text":"Went here for a little bday celebration and it was absolutely fantastic. The service was great and staff was so friendly and the food-was so fresh and cooked to perfection.

I had the special fish dish- the sol and we had the chicken and prawns with a side of grilled asparagus. So yum! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always looking for a non-chain  near home.  My wife and we're celebrating our 27th anniversary.  We were gonna head downtown but really wanted something near. Carefree Bistro  fit the bill.

The restaurant was well lit and extremely inviting.  A nice patio and small busy dinning room guests you on entrance.  Quickly state by a great justice and we were encouraged.

Quickly asked about drinks we needed a bit to look over the wine list.  A few good choices, reasonably priced..but no standouts.  

Great selection of appetizers..and a big list if specials.  We chose a few nice dinners, a Risotto  special and pasta fish..we were not disappointed.

Desert was outstanding...they were out of the Gelatin..but the flour less chocolate cake was excellent...and coffee was good and bold.

Service was attentive, friendly...outstanding..

Carefree Bistro..worth a trip..price was good..but food and service were excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that seems like it should be better than it is.  The food is a little on the pricey side and only average.  The atmosphere and service match the quality of the food.  This was only the second time that my wife and I have dined here, the first being a couple of years ago, and my impression of the place was the same then as now.  I may give it one more chance in a couple of years (if it is still in business) but certainly there are many better options available in the area."}
{"text":"We went to dinner without reservations. The place was filling up fast, but we were seated pretty quickly. put in the order for a margarita pizza, spicy Mediterranean meatballs and a beet salad. The food seem to be pretty fresh and clean. The pizza dough was a bit pasty if that's what you like. The staff was pretty friendly too. we are just visiting the area so I probably would try another place next time."}
{"text":"Good food. Great location. Sit outside with a view of the mountains. Plus the warmest and friendliest staff I've encountered. Home away from home."}
{"text":"I have now dined here 5 times. The food has been delicious each time and the wait staff has been attentive. I always start with the soup of the day, order a freshly baked flat bread (to die for) and have an entrée. In my opinion, if you are in the Carefree area stop here for lunch or dinner. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great food! Above and beyond great service! We will definitely be returning! Napkin art was top notch"}
{"text":"Our friends from Las Vegas had a casual lunch here a couple of days before they brought my husband and I here for my Birthday.  We had the tuna tartar for an appetizer.  It was wonderful.  It was fresh and very well seasoned.  We also had the trio.  All three dips were great--I especially loved the eggplant.  It was served with the home made pita which was cooked in the pizza oven.  Yum.  My hubby had the Moussaka which we all agreed was the best we have ever had.  I had the lamb brochettes with saffron rice and fresh asparagus.  Loved it.  We had one vegetarian and one vegan in our party of six.  There was something on the menu for everyone and our server, John, was very accommodating (not to mention charming).  Our friend that is vegan and asked for no cheese on his Parisian omelet--\"no problem--we will just put more veggies in it!\" For dessert they gave me a complimentary Tiramisu which was very good and not overly sweet. We ended with dessert and Turkish coffee (if you have never had it give it a try--strong but good). The Baklava was very good and not too sweet.  The chocolate lava cake was very good.  Vanilla Gelato good as the Profiteroles were yum. Normally we all share bites but no one would share their desserts!  These are six picky eaters and we were all very happy with the food.  Service was amazing. John was very helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu.  He even made a trip back to the kitchen to make sure the cauliflower soup was vegetarian.  We were not rushed as a lot of restaurants do.I live almost an hour from Carefree but it was well worth the drive.  We will absolutely be back."}

{"text":"Very fine service, very handsome waiter with a lovely Italian accent.  Delicious Merlot. I had the Greek salad. It was an ample portion with a perfect amount of dressing. Husband had the lamb meatball sandwich. It was tender, cooked perfectly, good temperature, could have been a bit spicier. Bread was excellent. Did I mention the Merlot from Chile? Excellent choice. It was quiet enough for a leisurely lunch and the waiter did not rush us."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying this restaurant for years. Each time is a unique culinary experience. Tonight, I started with a potato purée soup. My wife enjoyed a beet salad. Both yummy.  For our entree, we both enjoyed the filet of sole with artichokes, capers and fingerling potatoes in a delicious lemon sauce. It was beautifully arranged and carefully prepared to perfection. The staff is extremely personable, and welcoming. What a great local place. Give it a try. You'll definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant!  Fresh, clean, wonderful food!!!  The restaurant has been completely redone to make it open, attractive, and comfortable.  Good wine list!  Outdoor seating.  Owner/chef, George, could not be more personable.  We have been back twice and expect many visits as we enjoy good food - that is prepared with exceptional care and quality."}
{"text":"A lot of thought put into the combinations of sandwiches. Loved the blackened sole sandwich with cucumber salad"}
{"text":"My husband had an amazing brunch, our server was very attentive and made sure we were happy with our experience. The ambience set the mood right for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"The best testing food I have had in Arizona.  Service was great, ask for Roman, he did and excellent job.  The owner was friendly and welcoming.  We had to go back for a second try and the experience was even better that the first.  This is a must stop at if you are in Carefree and if you are not, it is worth your drive to have dinner their."}
{"text":"Way over priced and totally underwhelmed by the food and service!  They couldn't figure out how to split the bill. Drink order and pizza never came to the table. We wont be going back."}
{"text":"Went with my husband last night. It is Mediterranean fare and we both had the lamb skewers and it was excellent. The homemade chocolate gelato was delicious and their bread is very good too. Right now they don't have a liquor license so you can bring your own bottle which is great for saving some money and there is no corkage fee which is very nice.  Our waitress was very sweet helpful. It is a small intimate family run restaurant that you can feel comfortable dining at."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming into carefree bistro. Staff is very friendly and personal. They had a modified special menu for Valentine's Day. I had the paella and it was really tasty. If you are in the area looking for a great restaurant give carefree bistro a shot."}
{"text":"Signage is confusing here (this place has operated under different names) but persevere, it's well worth it! Tastefully decorated, casual spot with a broad menu. John, our server, was attentive and charming, very knowledgeable about wines and menu. Food (risotto with shrimp and vegetables, and sausage pasta) was exquisite; generous portions. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dinner in North Scottsdale, Carefree or Cave Creek.
  My wife and I had a great lunch in a very comfortable booth.
We starte with outstanding wines by the glass.  I had a Pinot Grigio from Italy; and my wife had a Chardonnay from France!  Both were excellent.
  We started with very delicious appetizers of Calamari and Crab.  Both were fresh, tasty and excellent.
  My entree was their Greek salad ordered with extra garbanzo Beans.  It was very fresh with many vegetables.  I had a French Cab. to go with my salad.
  My wife had Their Beets salad with lots of vegetables.  She commented on how good it was.
  Our server was FABIO who was quick to our every need.  I would ask for him again.
  This is a very comfortable good restaurant.   Try it .  You will not be disappointed.

Sincerely,

Ed Altman Jr."}
