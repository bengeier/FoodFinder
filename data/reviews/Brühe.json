{"text":"Next door to a little clinic I often visit, I tried BRÃ¼HE a couple times and the Staff are wonderful, the food is simple and healthy, everything on the menu is based on Health, the kombucha is awesome, I also tried the bullet coffee( coffee blended with butter) and the grilled cheese sandwich made with coconut bread, and a touch of honey. Did I mention everything is GlutenFree, including a great selection of Icecream by the cone or pint, if you enjoy healthy eating, must try this."}
