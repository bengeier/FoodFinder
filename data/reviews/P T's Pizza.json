{"text":"The best pizza around.  I have tried most pizza in the Irwin/Harrison City and North Huntingdon areas but have now found it's best to just make the 15 minute drive to PT's Pizza in Trafford.  I'm not one for going in to specific reviews on food but this pizza is a must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, hoagies and breadsticks. Lots of options in PT but we always go to PT's when ordering out! Great pricing and quality. We loved the garlic sauce they used to serve with the breadsticks. BRing it back!! :)"}
{"text":"Our go-to pizza place. We order here about once a week. You CANNOT beat the price. Hoagie orders you can put whatever you want on it (you don't have to go through a list of no this no that, you tell them what you want!). Breadsticks are fantastic and so buttery. Homemade pizza sauce is unique and great. Toppings are always plentiful and taste fresh. Service is almost always fast, even when they are slammed on a weekend. Good cheese sticks. And you must, MUST get the cinnamon breadsticks for an after-meal treat."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  They're is a lot is pizza within 2 miles but none have better taste or price."}
