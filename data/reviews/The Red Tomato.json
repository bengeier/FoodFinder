{"text":"They have special after 5pm at the bar that includes most of the smaller dishes and drinks for 5$-7$ each.  That was pretty good price and we tried almost every food on the menu and couple of drinks. This could be a place for you if you're looking for a good deal :)"}
{"text":"Dined with friends prior to a Mirvish show (got 15% off!) on a Wednesday night and had a delicious meal & great service (Jackie was just the right blend of friendly, efficient & informative). Because I read other recommendations that said portions were small,  we all ordered an appetizer and a main course (instead of splitting an appetizer between two like we usually do) and found that we were misinformed -- had more than enough food to eat! All recommended: Pork Tacos, Crab Cake (yes, just one), Chowder soup, Szechwan Kung Pao Chicken & Jalapeno Linguine  Calypso Chicken. Delicious martinis too! May be down the stairs, but didn't feel like the basement. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"This is my first time back in a couple of years to find a new pizza pasta menu at Red Tomato. The Neapolitan style thin crust pork belly pizza topped with chopped balsamic radicchio was done to perfection, crispy and yet chewy crust. My friend commented on her ricotta gnocchi as feathery soft and very tasty. In my opinion their pizza crust is as good as any of the popular pizza restaurants in Toronto but with more generous toppings. Service was friendly and we will be back for more."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers about the decor and being misled on where you will be eating. I was hoping for a table on the patio, but then we were lead to a weirdly lit and decorated basement. The basement had boxes and the broom in the open and the 'please wait to be seated sign' was hand-written with pen - I knew then what I was getting into but decided to give it a shot...  Our waitress seems out of sorts and maybe because it was TIFF/Madonna last night and people were in a rush, but as a customer coming to your establishment, I don't really care and honestly the place wasn't very busy. Her attitude softened later, but initially my friend and I were going to walk out when she condescendingly asked if we were ready to order...  If we wanted to get the $5 and $6 dollar drinks, we had to sit at the bar and there was a different menu.  As for the food? Not a fan. Coconut shrimp was dry and didn't taste fresh (4 pieces for $8). Peanut sauce that came with the chicken satays was really, really bland (3 skewers for $7). Bruschetta was okay (3 pieces, I think $6?). Didn't order drinks because I didn't fancy the price. $9 for a 6oz glass of wine, and $38 for a bottle at the least. I'm a foody and recognize that those are average prices but there's something about adding to your bill when you're not already thrilled with the food...  I couldn't wait to leave. The red lighting was giving me a headache and didn't make me want to stay. :( When I stepped out, I felt happy to see normal colours again. Won't return unless I'm looking for a cheap drink - but then again there are quite a few places on King with cheap drink specials..."}
{"text":"The only thing worthwhile about the Red Tomato restaurant is their waitress who had full blossom riped tomatoes...and a decent looking face...  Food was not good...Got crab cakes which were okay...Chicken satay were dry and not even warm...Lobster crab soup is alright...Stuffed calamari with risotto is different, but this one tasted rubbery... The mussels with leek sauce is interesting, but mussels were not tasting fresh...The ginger ale I ordered was a very small glass...All this for $65! Not a good place to dine overall..."}
{"text":"Cute place!  Somewhat unusual mix of mostly Italian food, with a dash of Asian menu items thrown in for good measure.  I stuck to the Italian fare, though was nearly tempted by Dim Sum.  Interesting and tasty take on the Caprese Salad (not your usual/boring sliced mozz/sliced tomato/basil leaf concoction). My meal was satisfying and hearty."}
{"text":"Yeah!! And yeah for the Yelp app or I would have never found you in my tourist wanderings through downtown Toronto. I wanted a bar that was cozy, dimly lit, and cool for the single lady just lookin for some vino and food. Loved IT!   First, hellooo is this the cutest, hippest, most relaxing bar ever? ! \"Yes\", I'm going to have to go ahead and answer my own question. Yeah! Second, the bartenders were beyond nice and so hip! I felt like I was in a neighborhood bar back home. Third, food? Ummm yum! And they may a very special vegetarian pasta dish for lil' ol me! Awww. Love u Red Tomato! I told all the other people at the convention about you! If I'm ever in Toronto again, guess were I'm hangin? I'm a lil' \"j\" of all that Toronto has to offer. Can u open a locale in CHI town??"}
{"text":"We went for a light dinner and had the lobster bisque, crab cake, and coconut shrimp. The bisque lacked either lobster or sherry flavour, the crab cake was lukewarm and insanely salty, and the coconut shrimp were greasy and bland.  With a drink each the meal cost more than $65 and left us both unsatisfied.  A very disappointing performance for a Toronto classic. One star for good service."}
{"text":"Love the \"Only at the Bar\" menu. Yummy food in perfect portions that you can eat on your own or order a bunch and share. Not sure what previous reviewers have against it being in the \"basement\". It's downstairs, but in no way resembles a basement and the decor is great."}
{"text":"decided to go here for dinner with a friend after browsing the King strip and its menu appealed to us more then other. we went with the fixed price menu which was a really great deal (i think it was $25 for wine, main and dessert) . i had the brisket which was incredible.   great atmosphere, service and lovely meal!   recommended!"}
{"text":"Not bad. We ordered the vegetable soup which was a little spicy but gave it a nice kick. The \"pulled pork quesadilla\" was okay..could have been better. Our favorite was the crab and seafood fondue dip"}
{"text":"Bit disappointed with the food at this restaurant.   I had the Seafood Orecchiette w/ Calamari, Lobster Tail, Shrimps, Mussles, San Marzano Tomatoes, Saffron and Garlic ($18). The orecchiette were clumped together and the sauce didn't have much flavour and was much too watery - it looked like I had ordered a bowl of tomato soup.   My friends had:  Salad Caprese - fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, EVOO ($9) - meh, nothing special.  Blackened Salmon w/ corn and black bean salsa ($8) - again, not much flavour.  Sauteed Garlic Jumbo Tiger Shrimps with angel hair marinara (18) - nice size shrimp, but again, the marinara sauce was very runny.   Location was great, we sat on the patio and it was a good place to people watch, however, I'm not sure if I would eat at this restaurant again since there are so many restaurants in the area.   Cheers,   - T"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot when no one can make up their minds on what they want to eat.  All round decent place in terms of service, price, ambiance and eclectic menu choices. Everyone needs a plan \"B\" and this is a pretty good one."}
{"text":"Very disappointing -- and I've been to this place numerous times and used to really enjoy it.   The atmosphere was still awesome, the wait staff attentive and friendly, and the food delicious.   So why only one star?  My pasta dinner was so small we had to go for a second dinner to another pub afterwards.   I had the stuffed pasta in a tomato sauce. Really good, but at $15, and listed as an entrée I expected it to be bigger than an appetizer.   My girlfriend had the roast beef and risotto which was succulent and tender, and slightly more filling. But still an incredibly small portion.   The Red  Tomato's menu lists more shareable options than entrées so perhaps that is what they are known for.   However, if you order something for dinner that is suppose to be an entrée, then it should be filling.   Those just wanting a good drink and some ambiance will enjoy the restaurant in Toronto's Entertainment District. Just go someplace else for food, unless you want to leave hungry."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely delicious dinner here after a stressful check-in at my hotel. The ravioli (vegetarian) was delicious, so well cooked with delicious vegetables as the garnish. For dessert my friends and I enjoyed some absolutely delightful cocktails. I had a Long Beach Iced Tea. It was strong, but not too strong, with some serious sweet flavor. The service was super friendly and quick. When I asked what they recommended for vegetarians, the waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner. Had a nice variety of beers on tap, plus a hard root beer that was really good. The pizzas were very thin and crispy. One of us had a burger. It was good but the fritters were really good. Would return. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We tried the lobster bisque which showed up with a pastry poof, which if opened from the centre resembled those pods from the movie Aliens. The arugula apple salad was nice. The Peking duck pizza captured that Asian flavour pretty close and tasted great. The slow roasted venison pasta was more of a venison stew with long pasta mixed in. The flavour was rich and tasty similar to lamb. I would have preferred smaller pasta pieces. Definitely enough food that could take some home.  The cheese cake is just okay. The tiramisu was more like Tira'mousse'u but was nice. The bathroom stall is small like an airplane bathroom.  Over all good experience, we'll go again to try some more pizza."}
{"text":"Rating is 3.5 rounded up.  Disclaimer: All drinks and dishes were provided free of charge by the restaurant. All opinions expressed below are wholly mine.  I was invites to check out the pizzas at The Red Tomato during their Pie Tunes media event. That night, I got to taste 6 of The Red Tomato's 10 pizzas. Toppings ranged from classics like Margherita to fusion flavours like Peking Duck. Each pizza was 11?, cut into quarters and a hefty meal for one. My four favourite pies were The Hangover Cure with tomato, olives, double smoked bacon, fresh mozzarella, chilies and topped with fried quail eggs. Toppings were loaded on the crispy crust and each ingredient complimented each other. In general, I found all the pie creations at The Red Tomato to be well paired.  Another favourite was the Peking Duck Pizza with roasted duck breast, enoki mushrooms, shitaki mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, hoisin sauce and crispy duck crackling. That crackling was amazing! Crunchy, savoury and just bursts of flavour (seriously, this is why I can't fit into any of my pants). After two pizzas with bold flavours, the potato pizza with slices of Yukon gold, caramelized onions, fennel, grana padano and fresh mozzarella was a nice mild break for my tastebuds. I did find my slice needed an added sprinkle of salt to brighten the natural potato taste. Lastly, I really enjoyed the garlic shrimp pizza that was the simplest with a walnut pesto and fresh mozzarella. Fresh, plump shrimp dotted each slice of pie.  Service was a bit messy as there were a ton of people. At first pizzas came of the kitchen and circulated, but many didn't make it far from the kitchen before all of the slices were snapped up. At one point, the server asked us to share slices between people. Cutting the pizzas into smaller slices (instead of quarters) would have helped alleviate some of the demand. Later on in the night, we were invited to place orders for pizzas that we had yet to try. This meant there was a huge influx of orders into the kitchen, way more than their capacity. In general, I enjoyed the pizzas at The Red Tomato, the dinner event itself had some logistics challenges keeping up with the crowd's demand."}
{"text":"A horseshoe bar, a curving staircase and outdoor seating offering a great view to everyone. The open kitchen sets the tone for a lively meal, a place where friends can meet and talk away into the night.   The famous Coconut Shrimp, Calypso Chicken Pasta, tasty Samosas, Pad Thai noodles, Nachos with Chicken Confit and 5-spiced Buddha Wings are quite a treat. Frequented by business types, club hoppers and theater goers it is very popular in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the worst restaurants I have been to. The servers were blatantly rude, asked if they could take something away or if we were still \"picking at the food,\" and didn't bring our salad because \"there was nowhere to put it on the table,\" when there was plenty of room. The food was nothing special, but the service was downright awful."}
{"text":"This is mine and my partner-in-crime's happy place. Soup. Happy hour. Company. Happy!  Happy hour is from Monday to Friday from 3-6pm. (They have happy hour at other times as well, but can't recall exact dates &amp; times.) Appies and sharing plates plus other items on their menu are available for a cheaper price point.  The soup is why we come here.  Lobster and crab bisque with a phyllo pastry baked over the bowl. Crack the pastry with your spoon and let it gracefully drift into the soup. Once your first spoonful of bisque and phyllo pastry combo waltzes in your mouth is when you'll truly understand what happiness really means. Now that's what I'm talkin' about babe!  The other items we ordered were non-memorable. At the Red Tomato, the soup is my taste buds' one and only.  For next time, I'm seriously contemplating ordering the soup as a starter and then ordering a second soup as my meal."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  We ordered an appetizer to share and said we would each like a pasta dish. He only brought one pasta dinner and told us that was all we'd ordered!  The dish was supposed to have angel hair pasta and it was brought to us with linguine. When we said this was the wrong pasta, the server told us that they didn't have the angel hair. I asked why he didn't come and tell us, he said he just found out!  NOT HAPPY!!!  Yesterday when we stopped in to make our reservation, we asked a question about a theatre two blocks down the street. The hostess replied, \"I don't know. I don't work there!\"  I couldn't believe her rudeness!  Definitely not professional."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here!  It's not the nicest decor, but quite interesting - very dark and I had a hard time seeing anything.  It's in the basement which is unusual.   The waitress was quite nice, and very efficient, without being overbearing. I had chicken pot stickers for $5.  It was a small portion, with 3 pot stickers, but this amazing chilli sauce with a bit of a sweet taste. Then I ordered the linguine carbonera for $14.  Initially it seemed like a small portion, but it was just the right portion at the end, where it was enough.   It was a good sauce, with big chunks of bacon, which tasted great. With a coke, I spent about $30, which was a bit expensive for what it was, but it was a unique experience, and I'd love to do it again soon.  On a side note, my friend's soup looked amazing.  You had to break the top open, with a crusty top - so I'd like to try that next time."}
{"text":"Great food. Service a little tardy. Had the garlic shrimp $18 delicious. Highly recommend and iceberg lettuce which was lacklustre."}
{"text":"Red. Red. Red.  How I love thee bar!  Went after work between the hours of 4:30 and 9pm. It was a lot of liquor.  So they have a great bar menu. If you sit at the bar (seating is very limited and it's packed early but dies down after the theatre starts) they have a special menu of $5-$6 drinks and a whole bunch of food for the same price. It was absolutely worth it. Value and quality do match up!  Things to try:  1) Pulled pork quesadilla 2) Duck wings (!) - right? 3) Crispy coconut shrimp  Just tell the lovely bartender Jordan (albeit all sass) that I sent you. And ask him for the blue gin drink... If you like gin and the colour blue of course."}
{"text":"It was a Thursday night and my fiancee' and I were exploring King St. There are within any half mile range more places I can count to eat at around here. I saw the sign hanging outside for this establishment and immediately had a memory of my mother raving about this spot, since we are a family of foodies, I decided this would be a good bet.   Upon walking down the steps into the main room we noticed it was absolutely jammed packed, it was seriously like a sardine can there were so many people here. The hostess asked if it was just the two of us and started to write our names and then out of the corner of her eyes spotted a table opening up so she gave us that one. I kinda felt bad for the 12 other people that were waiting along the rails behind us but hey, I'm not the one seating people. Moving along..  Our server literally had to be a contortionist to reach us due to the crowd, but reaching us she was friendly and had all the specials both meals and soups ready to go at a moments notice. We both decided on Pasta dishes that at the moment escape my memory. I'm sure that she had a simple linguine dish whereas I chose something a little more exotic with chicken and a garlic sauce. Hers was very tasty and came out promptly. Mine took an an extra 5 minutes and when I got it the pieces of chicken were cold. Also, the pasta was very spicy. It didn't say that it was spicy in the description however when I got it I could only handle a few bites before calling it quits. The server took notice and they did give a slight discount on the bill so I will give them points for that. We'll give it a shot again."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was something different. My group ordered several appetizers and they were less than satisfying. The Korean BBQ short ribs stick out in my mind. They were dry and incredibly flavor less. This is all unfortunate as this is a nice restaurant with a good location."}
{"text":"Yes, their location is weird. Fred's Not Here is the restaurant next door and to get to the Red Tomato, you go downstairs to this basement, albeit snazzy basement area. While looking for a place to eat before the baseball game, we were drawn in by their 2-course dinner + drink special for $25. I'm not a big drinker and I didn't think I would have room for an appetizer or dessert, so I opted for the flat iron steak with rosemary thyme garlic flavored with baked gorgonzola polenta. The steak was tender though they did not cook it medium rare. The gorgonzola polenta was really good. Since it was a Tuesday night, it wasn't really busy. The desserts are petite sized so don't worry about not having room for it!"}
{"text":"I was here last Wednesday for a casual meet up with a friend visiting Toronto. We did not have a reservation and were able to be seated in the lower level without waiting too long.  Environment = Chic, cute, aesthetically pleasing Food = Mediocre; their menu is attractive and there is a variety to choose from. Drinks = Great! Like the menu, there is a variety of cocktails to choose from. Service = Excellent! Staff were friendly, professional and pleasant."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant before a play. I ordered the coconut shrimp which were rubbery, greasy, and had a thick hard coating, although the dipping sauce was very good.  Main course was over salted and uninspired. The best thing about The Red Tomato is its close proximity to the theatre district."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat before a event.  We were told no tables available but could sit at the bar which was fine. Until we saw available tables.   Anyways after being kinda ignored we finally were able to order.  We decided that the Duck fat fries and the jerk chicken pasta sounded good.  We decided wrong.  To be fair the Duck Fat fries were good - crispy thin fries with parmesan cheese fried in duck fat were hot, crispy and tasty!  I could have licked the plate clean until i realized i was out in public!  The jerk chicken pasta was probably the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Overly salty dried up pieces up meat with some congealed looking sauce on the pasta.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten it but it was that or my socks.  I should have just eaten my socks :(  The restaurant is downstairs- decorated with cheesy lamps with red tomatoes on them.   Good place to watch a game but you aren't going to impress anyone here.  Service was slow as i felt we were ignored right up until we paid."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick dinner before a movie at ScotiaBank Theatres. While other restaurants along this stretch of King West practically grab you off the street and try to get you seated in their joint, we had trouble convincing the staff here that we wanted a table. When we asked for one we received an abrupt response asking us which restaurant we wanted to dine in (they have two restaurants in one).  Our server was polite. The food delivery to the table was odd, though. We each had ordered two appies as our meal and made it clear to the server that that was how we would be dining. Each dish was brought separately with a five minute or so delay in between each. It worked, but was a bit odd.  Each dish was delicious. The shrimp dim sum were great, though the \"wow-wow\" chili sauce could have had more kick. The calamari were fried perfectly ... very tender. The baked scallop was terrific as were the coconut shrimp. Portions were a bit on the smallish side, even for appetizers."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here in as many weeks and both times were spectacular.  From the very attentive service, the great 80's music playing on my 2nd visit to the really delicious food this is certainly worth visiting again. The atmosphere is cozy with a large bar which takes up most of the room and some kitschy \"red tomato\" lamp shades along the bar area.  There are very comfortable chairs and booth areas along the walls as well. On my first visit I was invited to try out their new pizza menu.  There is a wide variety of choices with very unique flavors and toppings all on nicely crispy thin crusts. From the Reds I thoroughly enjoyed the Sausage Pizza which came with tomato, caramelized onions and fennel.  Just enough kick in the sausage to be enjoyable.  Another Red which was interesting was the Hangover Cure.  Although a bit salty for my taste it certainly was a taste treat with tomato, bacon, olives, chilies and soppressata.   From the Whites there was also quite a bit of choice with a Mushroom Pizza, a Smoked Salmon (which ended up being my favorite), and a Potato Pizza. The Mushroom Pizza consisted of a variety of 4 types of mushrooms with truffle oil drizzled on top.  Quite tasty if you like the different textures and flavors of mushrooms as I do. The Potato Pizza had Yukon Gold potato (of course) along with caramelized onions and thinly sliced fennel which gave it a lovely flavor. My favorite as mentioned above was the Smoked Salmon Pizza.  A thin crust with mascarpone spread, grana padano, thinly sliced apple and arugula.  The arugula gave a very nice peppery taste along with the creaminess of the mascarpone.   There are also some very interesting marriages of ingredients with the Peking Duck Pizza and the Smoked Chicken with chipotle BBQ sauce.  The Peking Duck Pizza was very flavorful with the crispy duck crackling but I found the hoisin sauce drizzle too sweet for my liking. The Smoked Chicken was very interesting with the tiny bit of spice with the addition of the chipotle BBQ sauce. All of the pizzas are reasonably priced from $15.00 to $18.00 each for 4 large slices. On my 2nd visit I was lucky enough to share in a sampling of several appetizers, some mains as well as 3 of their desserts. Our group shared 2 soups, the Baked Lobster and Crab soup and the Gumbo Sausage and Chicken w/corn bread.  Both soups were very rich and the melding of flavors made them delicious.  The Gumbo had tasty corn bread to sop up even the last drop where the Lobster and Crab had what looked like beautifully toasted bun on the top.  Again to sop up every last delicious drop. We also shared the \"Jerk\" wings, the Calamari and the Coconut Shrimp.  All 3 were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. We decided to try some of the pastas and share them as well.  The favorite by far was the Garlic Shrimp w/Angel Hair Pasta.  Plump shrimp and the past melted in our mouths.  We also tried the Mushroom Agnolotti w/mushroom truffle butter sauce.  I was partial to this as I loved the mushroom flavors with the truffle butter sauce.  Another favorite was the Meatball Gnocchi with marinara sauce w/sausage and Angus beef meatballs.  Nice flavors in the meatballs and the Gnocchi were nicely done and held on to the marinara beautifully. One cannot have a lovely meal such as this and ignore dessert.  We decided to share again with Bread Pudding w/chocolate and banana, Chocolate Mouse and our waiters favorite, Creme Brulee.  All 3 were tasty with their own unique flavors but I agree with our waiter and will vote for the Creme Brulee as my fave! Although I have tried almost everything on the menu I will most certainly go back as some things are worth repeating!!"}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant to have dinner before my husband and I see a movie. I had high hopes that food will be great but I left disappointed. Why?  Food: we ordered peking duck pizza and pork belly pizza for our main. So the peking duck pizza has an overwhelming amount of shitake mushrooms and onions. Therefore,  I couldnt appreciate the taste of duck.  I'm afraid the duck wasn't the freshest too. I love  duck dishes so much and I was sad to have a dish that   all they did was dump fried skin, mushrooms, onions, tons of Hoisin sauce. I wish the layering of flavour and texture was there but it was just a sweet shitake mushroom pizza.   So for the pork belly pizza, the taste was so plain. It is llike have cheese pizza (no red sauce) then add think slices od pork belly. I don't know if they put shredded cabbage to add texture/ crunch to the pizza. Again, I was let down.   The Asian & Italian fusion idea was great but the excusion was poorly poorly done.     We had no problem with the service and surely it was not the waiters fault what goes on the pizza."}
{"text":"Very unassuming- I stumbled upon this restaurant near the theatre district, advertising their prix fixe menu and it was wonderful!  I had the Tom Yum wonton soup and Duck gnocchi- large portions, great value!  Friendly and efficient staff, cool red modern decor in this asian fusion restaurant."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years.  It's doing well for a place that's been around as long as the Red Tomato has.  The room is not very large, reasonably interesting with a nice big wraparound bar.  Clean and reasonably well maintained, though the table was wobbly.   The staff was friendly if somewhat disinterested. Appetizers we're good (Thai corn chowder in particular), mains were competent but uninspiring.  I recall the food being much much more interesting back in the day.  Desserts are clearly brought in and  were somewhat underwhelming.    Overall, not a bad experience, but neither was it an experience that would make me want to return.  And with all the other choices nearby, I'll try someplace else next time."}
{"text":"The ate at the Red Tomato recently and our expectations were not high; however, we were impressed. We were seated almost immediately and the waiter really went above and beyond to ensure we were satisfied. We ordered steak and a pizza and is was delicious and very flavourful in comparison to many well known restaurants. Would recommend the chilli oil to drizzle over the pizza and pasta (it's delicious). We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came in on thanksgiving Friday night and there was a Drag show-- \"Queens on King\". And it was amazing ! The host Scarlet was hilarious and had us all entertained--meanwhile, \"Fahrenheit\"  was just as comical with a feisty side to her! Loved them both! There was also a burlesque portion that repeated multiple times throughout the night which was amazing ! The bar was intimate (downstairs) but there are three or two levels for regular seating along with a patio. The food was amazing ! There's a late night happy hour menu and it's VAST and it's GOOD. I CANT WAIT TO GO BACK THIS FRIDAY ! $6 wine and 4.50 beers ! FYI don't know how the table service is we sat at the bar and had no problems :)"}
{"text":"This place looks very appealing when you walk by and has a cool interior downstairs, but I felt my visit last night was just alright and nothing spectacular.   We arrived around 9pm last night for dinner. One of the servers said please choose any table for 2 only, meaning my friend and I couldn't sit at a table for 4. Which is understandable but there were so many empty tables of 4, empty tables in general so I'm not sure who they were saving it for. It seemed like they tried to squish as many tables as possible on their patio making it super tight and uncomfortable. Once we sat down, we got waters right away and ordered some martinis. I would say the martinis were good value since I think the alcohol was free poured or something lol.   For our dinner, we ordered the pepperoni and chorizo pizza and the sausage pizza. We also started with Caesar salads. The salad was disappointing, didn't have any bacon or croutons, but I guess it was their take on the salad (had radicchio in it I believe). It wasn't bad but I guess I wanted a classic Caesar salad. My friend was there a few weeks ago and he wanted something he had last time so he asked the server if they changed their menu and she said \"we're always changing our menu\". She wasn't very friendly. I think she was over worked and tired, a little cranky but trying to hold it together lol. My friends pepperoni pizza was good, mine was lacking something. Just didn't have a lot of flavour. It was just salty meat. Also they put cilantro instead of basil on top. Guess they ran out.   We decided to grab another drink but felt pressured because the waitress was turning people away because they were closed (it was only 10pm). I guess King St. shuts down early. With 2 drinks each, 2 pizzas and salads, the bill was about $108 before tip.   I think next time I'll try something else on King. Service wasn't the best, and food was decent but lacking something. Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"REALLY didn't enjoy my meal here last night.   I walked into the restaurant and saw all the nice candle lit tables with fresh white tablecloths and great atmosphere.   THEN the waiter told me to decend down the stairs to where Red Tomato really was.  I was then met with red booths, tables and cheaper tealights - Bummer.  I have a thing about restaurants who present themselves well with nice table settings - usually means you get a better meal and they take pride with their appearance.   Anyways .. Red Tomato also had Tv Screens in different areas. I hate restaurants that have that.  You should be there for dinner with your company to engage in conversation - not watch the Leafs Hockey game score.    I had the 2 course meal with a drink for $26.99 I had the 6-hour oven roasted beef brisket with grilled mushroom risotto.   GROSS..  The sauce that drenched my meat was WAYYYYYY TOO SALTY.  Omg it just took away from the whole meal.  Then I digged into my risotto and it was undercooked. The only thing I enjoyed was my glass of wine.   The server just basically came to take our order and never checked back in with us and didn't have much of a personality for that matter.     I wouldn't come back here - There are other restaurants that look promising and a few which I've been to.  Most of the restaurants on that stretch have prix-fixe menu."}
{"text":"*I admit, I was invited to an event for their new pizza menu (not Yelp event), so if this review is against the policy, please let me know and I will remove it :)* *I would have given this restaurant a 3/5 because the pizza was some-what decent, however I gave 2/5 because of the attitude and professionalism of the staffs. *Staff talked behind my back (literally) for not finishing my pizza crust...  *Refused to serve me food because it was only given to food bloggers, however on the invite it did not mention anything about that, and I am a food blogger...  *Social media manager gave my friend an attitude because she was not a blogger.   -\"The Hangover Cure\" pizza - Tomato, Olives, Soppressata, Double Smoked bacon, Fresh mozzarella, Grana Padano, Chillies, topped with fried eggs The first one we got was the hangover cure pizza which I quite enjoyed, however it was extremely salty and there wasn't anything to cut down the salt level at all. Not sure if I would want something overly salted as my hangover food, but overall it was decent.  -Peking Duck Pizza - roasted duck breast, enoki & shitaki mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, hoisin drizzle w/green onions, crispy duck crackling:  This was my favorite of the night. The moment it arrived, there was a strong aroma from the sweet and pungent hoisin sauce, and duck was moist and tender. It tasted just like a real Peking Duck but on a pizza instead of being wrapped in a thin pancake.  -Pork belly pizza - Slow roasted pork belly, roasted sweet balsamic onions, fresh mozzarella, balsamic tossed radicchio:  The pizza was a bit too oily from the fatty and succulent pork bellies, however the balsamic onions and radicchio brought some tanginess and helped to cut some of that down.  -Prosciutto pizza - grilled artichoke pesto, fresh mozzarella, fired roasted sweet pepper & arugula:  The prosciutto pizza had the potential to be good, however I was slightly let down by this. The prosciutto wasn't salty enough so the entire pizza tasted bland, maybe it would have been better if the prosciutto was slightly cooked to bring out more flavors. The sweet pepper was a bit ... too sweet and contrasted with the savory pesto sauce, not really a good combination.  -Smoked Chicken - tomato, mozzarella, caramelized onions, sweet peppers, chipotle BBQ sauce:  I couldn't taste any \"smokiness\" from the chicken, however I thought it was pretty good and the chicken pieces were juicy. The sauce was a bit sweet but had a slight kick from the sweet peppers, I quite enjoyed it.  -Margherita pizza - tomato, basil, fresh mozzarella:  The tomato sauce was tasteless and there were barely any cheese.... I thought nothing can go wrong with a classic and basic pizza right? Oh boy I was wrong."}
{"text":"Keyword for the this place is \"weird\".  You see a big sign, enter the door, see the tables ready... and then a guy on the reception says that Red Tomato is downstairs, so instead of entering the restaurant you are descending to the basement. Weird.  Than you get seated and despite the huge size of the room, it looks dark and claustrophobic. Yet, you constantly have a feeling like you sit in the middle of a busy street - people passing by all the time. Hmm, weird!  You look at the menu, and there is nothing to recognize - all fancy names and strange combinations. Mine looked like a tiny piece of semi-cold fried meat, slapped in a pond of soy sauce, with a pile of salad leaves casually dropped as a side. Uneatable piece of straw carefully placed across that strange place completed the picture. Oh, just weird...  En fin. If you enjoy the dark and empty spaces, are looking for some artsy pile of ingredients looking way better on the chef' contest photo than in your stomach, and do not care to stay hungry after paying a hefty bill - Red Tomato may be your choice. Otherwise, I see no reason to be there."}
{"text":"From King St looking in, this place looked fantastic, and overall yes it was pretty great. The atmosphere is cozy with dim lighting, clean tables and modern presentation with contemporary style dishes. The cutlery felt cheap though. Not high end which was in contrast to the presentation of the rest of the restaurant (which I thought was part of the upstairs...ooops).   Sooooo......what I didn't realize until hours later (I missed this super important detail at the time of dinner) that this place is NOT one in the same restaurant. I thought we were dining at \"Fred's not Here\" but down the stairs is \"Red Tomatoe\". Basically you head in the door and upstairs in one place, down is the other.  Heading inside there is a really cool spiral staircase heading downstairs. This is where things get weird. Our hostess asked us where we wanted to be seated. Upstairs was where steak and seafood was being served (later I found out AKA \"Fred's not Here\" and downstairs was where pasta was being served AKA \"Red Tomatoe\". I touched in this right? Yup!!  Anywhooooo..... Seeing that my wife wanted pasta we headed down the 3/4 turn spiral staircase. We were seated at our dining room table made of medal - pretty cool looking but I thought it was a refurbished metal counter top from an industrial sized kitchen. Weird. Again. But kinda cool. And fun. You'll see both the booth with the metal table and spiral staircase in one of my photos.  Have you ever seen a Tasmanian devil?  Well out of nowhere came our waitress. Nice enough lady. Young, pretty, presentable, and polite. But she was quick. And that feeling she had of being busy seeped into our experience somewhat leaving us feeling anxious. And this dinner was for my wife's birthday so I kinda resented her busy-ness. Mind you we went to dinner just before a show (this place is super close to the Royal Alex and Princess of Whales theatre). So she may have been serving a ton of theatre going folk - in her defense. She had the PPP though (see above).  The food - was average. Tasty and hit the spot. My Dublin Coffee came before the dessert (it should have been presented same time dessert was). The dessert tasted like a thawed presidents choice cheesecake. And our PPP Tasmanian devil waitress forgot my wife's hot beverage - no need to remind her, my drink came separate from the dessert so why screw up dessert further?!  It was fair on the cost vs value scale - perhaps slightly more expensive than average.  Overall - I enjoyed myself. So did my wife. Certainly would like to try \"Fred's not Here\" next time. Or elsewhere. Lol."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat after or before a show. We hit up the spot before our show at the Royal Alexander and our dinner was awesome!   The good - absolutely delicious shrimp garlic pasta!! - the lobster and crap soup was amazing! Very light and not creamy and heavy and served beautifully. - the flavours of everything we ordered were right up there. Very fresh and authentic.  - servers were very kind and offered great suggestions.  The bad - the wine list is not the most economical, I do wish they had a few more affordable by the glass options - the restaurant doesn't tell you that you'll get a discount if you show theatre tickets - the wait was a bit long for the servers, for the empty restaurant and the few patrons I expected to be served a bit quicker."}
{"text":"Great place for small plates....and the lobster and crab soup is incredible.  It was a great introduction to Toronto."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived for our 7PM dinner and we were promptly shown to our table. Once our drink orders were taken, my friends and I discussed the menu and how we wanted to approach our dinner. I suggested that we each order an appetizer and a main, and share them - so that we can try as many of the menu items as possible. So that's what we did. We each ordered a different appetizer and main, and passed it around, with each one of us taking a small portion of each.  This is what we ordered...  Appetizers  BAKED LOBSTER & CRAB SOUP GUMBO SAUSAGE & CHICKEN WITH CORN BREAD FRIED & SMOKED \"JERK\" CHICKEN WINGS CRISPY COCONUT SHRIMPS WITH THAI DIPPING SAUCE CALAMARI  What we loved...  The lobster and crab soup was our absolute favorite! It was creamy and aromatic with lobster and crab flavors well infused into the broth. I also loved that it came with phyllo pastry baked over the bowl. It made the process of digging into the soup very dramatic and a bit of a spectacle.  Our 2nd favorite was the gumbo! It was rich, well-balanced with just the right amount of spice, and the cornbread, though not appealing to look at, was flaky and buttery. Yeah, noticing a pattern here; they know how to make soups! Which, I must say, I find pretty damn impressive since from my experience, infusing deep flavor into a soup is not an easy task!  Both the calamari and shrimp were tasty, but I was not a huge fan of the batter and the seasoning - I personally found the two a tad bland and overly battered.  What we did not love so much...  Our least favorite were the wings. Unlike the soups, the wings tasted like the seasoning and flavor was superficial, and not absorbed into the meat. The wings tasted bland and incomplete. I also felt that with a side of rice, the dish would have improved since they were bulky and awkward to eat on their own. But then again, if you add rice, then they are no longer a starter. Hmm  Mains  MUSHROOM AGNOLOTTI WITH MUSHROOM TRUFFLE BUTTER SAUCE JALAPENO LINGUINE CHICKEN 'CALYPSO\" WITH MUSHROOMS, SUNDRIED TOMATOES, WHITE WINE JERK CREAM SAUCE GARLIC SHRIMP ANGER HAIR PASTA MARINARA MEATBALL GNOCCHI PORK BELLY PIZZA (no longer on their menu)  What we loved...  The angel hair pasta with the garlic shrimps! Hands down the best main! The pasta was cooked to perfection - not soggy and not tough. The shrimps were plump and juicy, and the sauce was creamy and well-seasoned. To be honest, I hated having to share it. :(  My second favorite was the meatball gnocchi. The gnocchi was also cooked well (too often I find they are too soggy and cloggy-tasting) and the meatballs were placed on a delicious rich red tomato sauce that helped them stay nice and moist.  A dish that my friends really enjoyed but I didn't was the mushroom agnolotti. I love mushrooms, just not as a filling. That's just a personal preference, but that said, and to be fair, my friends really enjoyed this dish.  What we did not love so much...  Our least favorite pasta was the linguine with the jerk sauce. The jerk sauce just did not work for us. I am not sure I understand why this restaurant is so adamant about using jerk seasoning. It's not working! In fact, this was the only pasta dish we could not finish. Imagine a brown sauce meeting a cream sauce resulting in a brownish mess on top of pasta.  And then to your horror, the two hate each other and the poor pasta and chicken are the victims of this disaster. So very sad.  The other item we could not finish was the pizza. But there is no point discussing it since it's no longer on the menu, and if you read my earlier post on the pizza menu launch, you will see that I was never a fan of their pizzas to begin with.  Desserts  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CREME BRULEE BREAD PUDDING  What we loved...  We loved all three desserts, but being a bread pudding lover, my expectations were set high! And they delivered! The bread pudding was not soggy, yet creamy, and not overly sweet. Good texture, and just the right amount of sweetness - score! Oh, and I can't forget the caramel sauce! Who does not love caramel?!  The creme brulee was creamy with a nice and crispy sugar-coating that we enjoyed cracking.  The chocolate mousse was rich and the combination of light and dark chocolate was a nice touch - not everyone loves dark bitter chocolate.  In sum...  My friends and I had a fantastic experience at The Red Tomato. For me in particular, I was relieved to see that they were able to overcome and repair my last experience there. The service was on-point, the food mostly did not disappoint - amazing bisque, gumbo, angel hair pasta, meatballs, and desserts - and the vibe was relaxing and friendly. For these reason I suggest you give them a try. Though I would stay away from any menu item with the word \"jerk\" in it.  P.S. I don't have anything against jerk spices. In fact, I love it! When done right."}
{"text":"Traveling for business in Toronto and arrived late. Asked hotel a close by place on King St for something quick and they recommended this place.  I liked the menu since it offered a lot of variety and many combinations of different flavors. Also the To Share menu at downstairs bar allows you to try a few different things at very reasonable prices.  They also have a good beer selection of local and imported beers.  I went with the crispy salt & pepper spare riblets - only 7$; and mushroom agnolotti w/ mushroom truffle sauce. The riblets were cooked perfectly, just the right amount of crispy. Great heat but not overpowering. If you like mushrooms the agnolotti were awesome. Mushrooms abound. The sauce was great w/ butter, porcini and button mushrooms.  I would definitely go back to try other shareables."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was skeptical about what to expect. From the service, the ambiance,the flavor and portion size of entree's we were pleasantly surprised.I enjoyed a pulled pork Quasadilla with black beans for starters and for my main course I had a beautiful New York strip steak with frits cooked to perfection with a crisp serving of green beans.My wife enjoyed the caesar salad and the jumbo garlic shrimp in an angel hair pasta with marinara sauce .She enjoyed it immensely.We also didn't go away hungry,the serving sizes were just right.The waitress was pleasant ,courteous and her timing was impeccable.Although the lighting had a red tint to it,it was pleasant and helped create a warm and relaxing atmosphere.I am sure we would go back again. P.S. The Cheesecake for dessert was just right too."}
{"text":"I attended a media event for The Red Tomato, a pizza and pasta wine bar underneath Fred's Not Here (both owned by the same owner). I rarely eat on King Street West so I always assumed that prices at the restaurants would be super expensive. However, when I saw The Red Tomato's menu, I was pleasantly surprised that the prices were quite fair (ranged from $13-$18 for a full size pizza).  My friend and I got to try a nice array of pizzas that were offered at the restaurant. My absolute favourite out of the bunch was the Peking Duck Pizza ($18), which was one of their Asian fusion items. If you love Asian food, I do recommend the Peking Duck Pizza! My friend however thought it wasn't that great and preferred \"The Hangover Cure\" ($16) without the egg. I enjoyed every single pizza at The Red Tomato that I got to try (which is rare!). Each pizza is savoury and you can taste how fresh they are!  I highly recommend The Red Tomato if you want to get some delicious and uniquely flavoured pizzas at an inexpensive price!"}
{"text":"Great tapas, but they seem to make martinis a little stingy.  Bar staff is regulars and usually remember you!"}
{"text":"My hubs and I found The Red Tomato as we were walking around trying to decide what we wanted for dinner.  It was freezing, and after a half hour of walking it was the only thing we could agree on.  It's down some stairs, below another restaurant (the front door is used for both). After walking in and being seated, I had serious doubts about this place, but I was happily proven wrong.   We were sat and we were the only people in the restaurant on a Sunday evening. My doubts grew stronger as I read the menu. I mean, what kind of Italian restaurant has gumbo, pork satay, and Peking duck pizza?   None I've ever been to!  I grew up in a very Italian area of upstate NY, I hold Italian food to a higher standard than other types of fare.  By the time we ordered, I wasn't expecting anything better than what may come out of a can.  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.   We decided to keep things simple and split a meatball gnocchi and I ordered a Caesar side salad.  The meatballs were large and delicious, cooked perfect and seasoned well.  The gnocchi was cooked perfect, which is hard, because half the time when you order it they come out tasting like dough.  The salad was about twice the size of a regular size salad, and I ended up taking about half of it back to where we were staying to eat the next day.  The Red Tomato was one of the highlights of our trip, and we look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for dinner with reservation. They were polite, and there was nothing obvious that was wrong. But the little things added up unfortunately.  Ordered coconut shrimp app...friends got calamari and short ribs. Everything was okay. Ordered an old fashioned drink. The \"old fashioned\". But they said they had no oranges. Main course was unfortunately disappointing... Very small portion sizes for all meals at table. I ordered a jalapeños linguine. Small portion size..couldn't taste any jalapeños or any spice at all. Everyone at table said food was \"okay\". Had to ask waiter a couple times to follow up on items we were waiting for.  Think they need to put a little more effort in unfortunately. I would say this is 2.5...I just can't rate as 3 because I won't be coming back. Not terrible, but I was not impressed enough to return."}
