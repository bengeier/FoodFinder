{"text":"Really bad! Pictures on menu do not represent the food! We asked for non spicy hot pot that our daughter would eat with us and when I arrived aside from not having the variety of vegetables on the picture there was about 1/2 a sliced jalape√±o bubbling away in the broth which we didn't find till it was too late. Talked to the server and then got no service for the rest of the meal. Honestly if I could rate it with lower I would. We will not go back!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 4-5 person combo and there is no way 4-5 people can finish all that food.   The food was really good but the service wasn't the best. Waited a few minutes to get seated but once we got seated it got alot smoother."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant because of friends recommendation. Not open no hours posted. No one answer the phone. You wonder what kind of service you will get."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the renovations they did from the previous restaurant. The ambiance is awesome.  The food was great. Highly recommend trying the BBQ and pork bone soup. No real complaints regards to the service when we were there."}
{"text":"Ordered through Just Eat... was very disappointed. I ended up paying $30 for some very fatty pieces of beef, some rice and a whole bunch of toppings (that part was appreciated even if not used).  Will not be reordering."}
{"text":"We were sorry when Wayo's predecessor (Sura) close, because it was our 'go to' restaurant for Korean cuisine.  We are happy that another Korean restaurant opened in its place back in November 2014.  Its menu is quite similar to Sura's and is not fusion as one reviewer noted.  The portions are good and so was the service.  There was a good variety of banchan (side dishes) and the main dishes were flavourful.  I think this will become my 'go to' Korean cuisine from now on."}
{"text":"Personally I thought it was pretty good. Fusion korean restaurant that is very clean and their service is good. They opened up recently so there is some waiting but I was pretty satisfied overall. For people who wants real korean food or for people who wants a large dinner....maybe look for some other restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to visit Sura frequently and was sad when it closed suddenly.  It was a leap of faith to try out Wayo as the previous reviews were not promising, but I guess someone got to try it, right?  Similar to the previous review, I found the menu was similar to Sura.  The Korean BBQ dishes (Bulgogi, etc) went up in price with $4-5 more, but most dishes are similarly priced.  We ordered 3 dishes: 4 stars for Japchae (stir fried yam noodles) the taste was right but a bit too much pepper. 3 stars for seafood pancake: while the pancake was full of seafood, the texture of the pancake was too soggy and too cakey. 4.5 stars for short rib soup: the broth was rich in flavor but clear, the rib was tender!  The restaurant was running very lean with only 1 server to attend the entire frontend.  The poor girl had to serve 6 tables plus greeting the incoming guests.  She was working so hard but had a tough time to keep up with every table's requests.  I would give them 4 Stars if they would have another helper and more attentive service.  Will I come back? Definitely yes.  The food is tasty.  After all, you don't come to an Asian restaurant for service, right?"}
