{"text":"Wowza! Fantastic  strip steak for  $10.00 on Wed. Nights!! Cocktails are a good pour and the atmosphere is clean, warm and cozy! Highly recommended for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"I pick this bar over any other local bar every time. You can't beat the price and atmosphere. Very clean, great bartenders, good food, music, and the game is always on. The owner is sweet as can be, but she has zero tolerance for baby momma drama in her bar. Music is kept at a minimum volume, and you can't swap out your french fires for a different side. Sometime you gotta play by the rules.

If you're looking to participate in twerk fest 2017 this isn't your bar. The crowd is older, respectful, and regular Hunt's Bar attendees. One of my favorite bars in the Falls!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks with a few friends when staying at the Sheraton for a wedding. Great local bar and reasonably priced drinks. Clean and warm atmosphere. Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall bar. With the best bartender around-Josh...and the best people watching. If you're looking for a good drink and a good juke box-this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great little place for drinks.  Scott makes a great drink.  I haven't tried the food there but it looks good and the price is right.  I wish this bar were closer to home, I would be here every Friday night!"}
{"text":"Great place beats going to chain places. The staff was very friendly. I would go back. Also goid food"}
{"text":"I prefer small, local bar/restaurant joints. So this is my kind of place. Small, quiet, friendly service and good food that won't break the bank. 

Six of us ate there not too long ago and their homemade chips with dip were delicious. We couldn't stop eating them. All of our entrees were good as well. 

Everything came out quickly and the price was right. The only minus for me was the beer selection. I'm a complete beer snob and there wasn't much in the way of wheat beer."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that some might call a hole in the wall, but it's one of our favorite local bars in town! Everything is reasonably priced, they always have Cleveland sports on, and the food isn't bad either (definitely go for the wings!). What's also nice is that they have their own parking, so you're not stuck driving up and down Front street looking for a spot!"}
