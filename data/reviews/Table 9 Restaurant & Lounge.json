{"text":"I met with family for dinner here, the wait staff was wonderful, the bartender made an amazing red velvet martini. I ordered a steak that was cooked perfectly to temperature and so nicely seasoned and great quality that there was no need for A1. Atmosphere here is warm and enviting. Be prepared to experience unique flavors that will ensure you come back again."}
{"text":"I'm stopping short of 5 stars because I feel like I need to order some more food before taking the plunge. 

I've only ever been here right after work for happy hour and obviously to sit at the bar. The drinks are fantastic and Glenn is a wonderful bartender. I came a little earlier than my two other guests the first time I was here and he was engaging and funny. My dirty martini was SO DIRTY and delicious and we were pleasantly surprised by the kale chips that they give you as bar snacks. The mussels were also fantastic, as were the Mediterranean nachos, though I could have used a little more toppings. When we returned, we had an orange blossom lemonade cocktail which was super refreshing and delicious, though I would have preferred to have it in a tumbler and not a martini glass...but that's just a weird preference of mine. 

Overall, I think this is a great bar, with good small plates, service, and drinks! Definitely a happy hour go-to, with $5 drink and food specials."}
{"text":"The owners of Table 9 also opened Walk in the Park Cafe. I've eaten at both. I had the Bison Burger amd would def order it again. My coworkers had tje crab cakes and said theu were also good.  Unfortunately the service was not up to par. They mixed up the orders of 2 people I was with. Rather than take them back to the kitchen they brought out additional plates and scraped the misplaced items off and then handed them to the correct person. I wouldn't have accepted but my coworkers went with it. I myself was never offered anything but water as my beverage. 2 of us planned on ordering dessert, but the waitress never offered. The owner made up for it by bringing us out 2 desserts on the house. I'll give it a few weeks to work out the kinks before deciding to try them again. 

As for their Walk in the Park Cafe... We stopped over for lunch and I ordered the steak wrap. There was more bland rice than anything and I realized later that I didn't get the chips and salata that it was supposed to have come with it. To top it off I stopped there today to try their waffles, but even though it was after 7am (they open at 7) they were not open. The people in there saw me and just stared. They didn't seem to Concerned about opening late or losing a customer. 

My stars are for table 9 since walk in the park is not listed yet. If I were able to rate walk in the park cafe it would be 1 star right now."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. Unfortunately, the food kind of ruined the experience. Let me start with the positives, our waiter was really nice, as was this super awesome waitress with pink hair; and the prices are very fair. Both of the people I dined with enjoyed their meals, so my star rating does take that into account. Unfortunately, there were a few glaring issues with my meal. I ordered the seasonal vegetables, which as a whole were very good. However, several of my bites were charred beyond belief. The same goes for the chicken sandwich I ordered. The bottom of the chicken was completely black and tasted like char. Having worked in a kitchen for 8 years, it was clear to me that the cook burned it and decided to put it char-side down, rather than replace it. 

While it may seem like the positives outweigh the negatives, a horribly burnt piece of chicken being served to a customer is something that cannot be overlooked, as it's such a simple fix. The fact that the cook would put out that product, shows his standards aren't as high as they should be. 

Here's hoping the kitchen steps up and raises their standards. Perhaps in the future, I'll try it again and find their consistency a bit more flattering."}
