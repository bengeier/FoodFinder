{"text":"I've been eating / taking out  food from here for over 10 years. LOVE this place. Food is consistent and always filled with flavor. Be careful if you ask for spicy..this is \"guyanese (caribbean) spicy\", so it's usually HOT if you ask for it. Take-away is always  available in about 20 minutes, so call ahead and  you'll be in and out. Probably my favourite place to get chicken fried rice in Toronto (ask for special chicken fried rice), you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and extremely tasty. It came out in a timely manner and the staff was very accommodating when it came to ordering the food. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Went there and had the special timehri fried rice with shrimp and pork with fried chicken on top...it was really delicious with the hot sauce they gave..so recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times as its one of the few Guyanese places nearby. Based on the last visit I doubt I'll be going back. I ordered a potato curry which had a decent amount of pepper added to it. Flavour was decent but if someone in your house doesn't eat pepper they won't eat the curry. Unlike other places that make it mild and serve pepper on the side, this one is spicy. Also got the chow mein with the chicken on top. The chicken was oily and not very flavourful. The noddle portion was even worse. The noodles were very greasy and other than the flavor from the actual noddle it didn't have any taste...Did they add anything other than oil?? Don't get chow mein there it's horrible. Also got the pholourie which was rubbery and tough. Maybe the batter was old or over beaten, I have no clue but I'm sad the food quality has diminished so much. The restaurant itself was a little cold, like they didn't have heat on and the dining area (as always when I've been there) was dark like they only expected take out customers. There's already a lack of Guyanese restaurants, so it's always a shame when the ones that are around aren't about quality anymore. Doubt I'll be returning. I gave two stars because the lady is very nice."}
{"text":"They have two locations.The other one on Mcnicol is more of a family environment.Nice decor. This one recently though was renovated, a better atmosphere for sit down eating , now. I usually go before the evening .I chose this one because it is closer for me to get to driving down from Pickering .The times when I do stay to eat would be if I am with one of my parents or someone else over the age of 18 .LOL Hence the reason why I stated the other one has more of the family atmosphere.This one in the evening is more filled with people who seem to stop by for drinking ,on the most part. No matter if you choose to stay or take away the food is tasty and well flavored. They have Guyanese Chinese style food and other Guyanese flare.  The owner is very friendly .The wait staff can change quite a bit .So I have had my share of excellent ,mediocre to poor service there. One girl who seems to manage it , a times and if I remember she did advise she was related to the owner  can be sour faced and bad mannered depending on which side of the bed she wakes up on , it seems . Since I mostly only do take out at this location and call ahead so they have my order ready ,which I see many people do . I am basing my score on the take out experience mostly"}
{"text":"Used to go to this place about ten years ago, but stopped after we moved.   Tried it again today with work colleagues. The food was terrible. We had vegetable chow mein, vegetable fried rice, curry goat, dhal puri (roti), chilli chicken, and fried chicken.   Everything had a hint of sugar. No spices. Pepper sauce was weak.   Service was slow.   We were all disappointed.   Not returning."}
