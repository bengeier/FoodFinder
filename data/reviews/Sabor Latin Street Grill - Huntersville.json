{"text":"EVERYTHING was cold.  Not sure how that happens.  They were extremely busy and there wasn't really anyone available to mention it to.  We will give it another shot in a few weeks when the newness wears off to see if they've worked out all of the kinks."}
{"text":"When yelp says hot and new, they mean it!  Came here less than a week ago and it was hotter in the restaurant than it was outside.  Not sure what all was going on, but I assume its something they will fix.  Food was decent, but honestly the heat was too much to handle.  Only giving 2 stars because of the Hawthorne location.  I'll be back, the other locations rock, but this wasn't even a tolerable environment."}
{"text":"Service was great especially for the volume of customers that came in. However the $1 Taco's have about half an ounce of toppings on them. There's more chicken and beef juice on the tortilla than there is chicken and beef. My suggestion to the owners is make Taco Tuesday $2 tacos and make a decent taco for the SAKE OF TACOS. Also, include Pastor and Carne Asada tacos in the Deal.  ** There must have been a mistake when I was in for Taco Tuesday we were charged $3 for Tofu and Pastor tacos.. I will be back to give it another try, after all no one makes an Arepa or Empanada quite like Sabor in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So glad to have a sabor north of the city for all of us north charlotte dwellers! I went to a media event preview before opening to the public and can confidently say this will be a hit like all the other sabors. There is a good amount of seating, a clear walk up aisle to order and of course, the famous salsas. I always have to go with elote loco (street corn with mayo, cotija cheese and paprika) because it is absolutely delicious! They are known for their arepas so get those too. Another favorite is the yuca fries with chicken. It's such a delicious palate of flavor. The quinoa bowl is  my favorite lighter item on the menu. Overall I feel like it's hard to go wrong!"}
{"text":"Delicious fast casual Latin food! A step up from the former tenant, Salsaritas. Parking is easy, seating is sufficient. Service could be a little faster but I'll cut them some slack because it's their first week open. Arepas were amazing, maduros were delicious, and the yuca fries were like something out of a dream. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really excited that Sabor has opened in huntersville.   Now I can eat here everyday!!!  I really enjoy their food and think that they do a great job.     Had the Burrito Especial and it is a staple.    Portions are generous and it has everything included in the burrito.   Wife had the street tacos (shrimp) which again they do a great job.  Also get a side order of chips.  They have a variety of salsas to choose from.  The pineapple habenero is pretty strong.     Service was good and our order was delivered quickly.   Of course just being open for a few days they were packed.     This is a great addition to the huntersville food scene."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little packed with the way the seating was arranged but it's worth it for the food. They have quick service and it's always nice seeing employees actively cleaning tables. They were definitely on their A game."}
{"text":"Finally! Our favorite quick Mexican restaurant has made it to Lake norman area. And word on the street it'll be in Davidson shortly.   This is a quick , affordable but fresh Mexican. My go-to is the nachos they are huge and my husband and I can never finish them. They are loaded in every layer with cheesy goodness. Topped with guacamole. I always get the shredded chicken with refried beans.   They are still working the kinks but overall it's up to par with the other Charlotte locations.  Gorgeous inside with a liquor bar/beer cooler and lots of fun drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is hot, and by hot I mean they have no air conditioning. It is currently 97 degrees in Huntersville and it feels cooler outside the restaurant. As for the food, it was average. The street tacos we had are easily made at home."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times now.  They still have a few kinks to work out but all in all it is really great. I understand this is new so I will not dock them for the kinks because we really do like this place a lot and will definitely be back, many times.   The good: -The food is delicious, very fresh, and plentiful!  -The service is very quick and polite.   -Our food came out super fast, really super fast.  -The staff was always checking on us and even cleaning our trays/plates/trash.  We even had a staff member refill our drinks for us (when it wasn't crazy busy that is). Very nice!  The great service is why I tip nicely.   -The restaurant is clean and decorated nicely.  -I love the build your own because I love picking exactly what I want in my meal. -we have gotten chips, burritos, quesadillas, tacos, taco salads, and burrito bowls and everything was super delicious and large.  Enough for 2 meals if you are not super hungry.  -The salsa bar is awesome!!  Great choices and something for everyone.   The kinks: -Was very hot. The air conditioner needs to be serviced or whatever.   -There is only one small soda machine. There was a line for it many times and the ice would run out fast.  -My son ordered a kids meal that comes with a soda but I still got charged for the soda (new employees that need to learn the menu, I am sure).  -We checked in on Yelp to get free chips then ordered a large queso which also came with free chips. We only got one order of the 2 chips we should have gotten. We told a worker about the chips and soda and got another basket of chips and another soda, so all good!  Of course I showed the receipt so they could see what I ordered.   -When we have gotten burritos with black beans, the beans are not strained enough which makes the burrito too soggy and extremely difficult to eat. Again, I'm sure they just need some training.   All in all we really love this place. Just need a few fixes that's all. Thank you for opening in Huntersville!!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all. Open tables were dirty...we had to clean our own. Half the drinks at the self serve soda fountain were out of order. Tea station empty. Food not good. Ground beef empanada tasted like pure salt with a ton of grease...same with chorizo empanada. Chicken Arepa was inedible and my teenage son who usually devours chicken quesadillas (or any food for that matter) barely ate half of his.    Hotter than Hades in the building also.  Extremely uncomfortable. The whole experience was just icky. I feel like I just threw my money down the drain.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"So glad Sabor has opened in Huntersville.  Love this place. The arepas are delicious.  Want to try everything on the menu.  Service is good and staff is friendly."}
