{"text":"One of the several noodle houses among restaurants on this side of the plaza. Noodle bowel remains extra steaming hot for a very long time. This is one of few restaurants I don't get run of diarrhea after the meal. Lol."}
{"text":"Hot till the last bite!   Service is pretty great - quick and nice. They give you extra noodles for free if you want!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and it was lunch time.  There are a lot of restaurants in First Markham Place and we chose Oriental Rice Noodle House on an impulse after walking past the sign.  It turned out an amazing decision!  This soup noodle restaurant is so good that I could start coming here every time I'm craving noodle soup.  I ordered the original broth soup noodles plus extra lamb ($2.99 for extra meat).  The soup came in a large deep bowl with delicious broth and the meat already cooking inside.  Then they bring you a big big bowl of noodle and a tray with at least ten topping.  You add the noodles and toppings into the soup and add seasoning to taste.  I liked all the toppings and added them into my soup, but saw other customer exchange a topping they did not like for another serving of one they liked.  The meal looks really easy to make (and probably is), but Oriental Rice noodle house provides a really valuable service making your broth and noodles and providing you with the all the variety of toppings ready to cook.  They do so with quick, efficient service and at a reasonable price.  Fantastic food, tremendous value and fast service making Oriental Rice Noodle House one of my new noodle restaurant favorites.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. 4.7 / 5.0"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is similar to Dagu. The menu is quite similar. I got the noodles with the tomato soup base (I don't remember the exact name in English). I personally prefer this place over Dagu for the following reasons:  (1) The dining area of the restaurant is beautifully renovated compared to Dagu and it is also cleaner than Dagu. (2) This place has way better service.  (3) This place puts the noodles in this pot that keeps the noodles and soup hot for a really long time. This meal is ideal for a cold winter day.  (4) There are many toppings that come with the noodle soup.  (5) The portions are more reasonable.  All in all, I recommend this place over Dagu any day."}
{"text":"Really great place located at First Markham Place. Delicious soups and rice noodles for a great price! I got the spicy noodles with seafood (not pictured but came with three shrimps, two mussells, and two pieces of crab). Also tried the curry noodles and various side dishes - side dishes were OK. For an additional $3 you can add various meats/seafood, but the noodles already come with 10 toppings (like corn, ham, quail egg, etc.) Definitely recommend this place if you are in this area!"}
