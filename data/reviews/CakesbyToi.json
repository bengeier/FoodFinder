{"text":"I am a huge fan of both locally owned businesses and cupcakes.  Cakes By Toi combines these loves with an okay result.  I decided to stop by on my way home after a long day at work, and after telling myself repeatedly I would stop in and try this place.

It is in your typical small strip mall.  Walking up it appeared they may also sell some sort of Thai food for lunch although when I walked in I only saw the bakery area. The interior is very plain, which is fine as I was there for the cupcakes. Sprucing it up a bit wouldn't hurt. They had a couple cases that had cupcakes and cakes ready to go.  The staff behind the counter were very friendly, and I got the sense by the ages that it may be members of the family all working there.

The cupcake, the most important thing, were okay.  There were reasonably priced, especially compared to certain designer cupcake bakeries.  I purchased half a dozen to share with the family.  The flavors were good as were a few of the frostings.  My greatest disappointment was a couple were stale and the frosting had hardened on a couple.  I'm not sure if maybe due to the lack of traffic in the area if they were a day old, but lacked the fluffiness you want from a cupcake.  I have actually gone to this location twice. On a weekday 2 out of 6 cupcakes were like what's described with the other 4 being really good.  I then went on a weekend and each cupcake was pretty hard.

I will certainly give them another shot, and would like to try a cake that I know is going to be made fresh for whatever occasion as I want to support our local businesses, and the experience overall is worth giving them another shot."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying. If you cant make a cake the way some has asked you politely decline it's better than giving someone a piece of shit cake. So i placed an order with enough time to make the cake I wanted, the cake lady told me it was going to be good and since I got referred she said she would do an awesome job. I put my faith in this lady to do my babyshower cake the way I wanted it done. On Thursday I get a call just making sure what I i order June 4th). I told not to do the glove to do the baby..she said okay then i come in at 2:12pm June 6th to get the cake the baby shower starts at 3pm. Well my cake isnt ready.. she said the order time says 230.. well I cam early so why isn't it ready. Please don't tell me you just started decorating the cake.. to make a long story short. My cake came outl looking like a totally different cake. Was I mad hell yes. If my cake lady wasn't booked that day I would of went to her, but i went to a low budget cake lady who obviously needs to work on her decorating skills..it's funny how most think you can't do it yourself, but my mom is a chef and baker..my.dad has 30 years a chef and baker and if he was alive I would asked him to do my cake. If i didn't plan my own shower I would of did it myself, but i entrusted in this lady something that she took from me and I can't never have back. Never ever ever go here. The fact she has people in the kitchen cooking and baking with Sandles on should of been my hint. I wasn't going to bash her or go on here. But seeing they aren't of theie word when my mom called down their and spoke to the owner who said he would call back with a final verdict. Then I am.letting the public know. Never ever ever ever go to thenm. Try to support black owned business and this shit happens"}
