{"text":"I thought the pizza was quite good, and the ingredients were very fresh.  However, for a medium pizza with 3 veggie toppings, 2 meat toppings, and cheese, the total was $19.50!  I've never paid that much for such a small pizza.  A medium pizza only has six smaller slices, which is just enough for 2 people.

Overall, the service was great, and I enjoyed meeting and speaking with the manager.  We also had gelato, which was terrific.  

All in all, I think the prices are too high, but it's worth checking out to come to your own conclusion."}
{"text":"Tried Revolution, since someone said they have a new chef and it was amazing.  I was not disappointed at all!  The Chef Ronnie B, came out and greeted us himself and talked about the menu and even took our order before the server even had a chance to check back. He then came out to make sure we were satisfied which all of our dishes.  Everything tasted amazing.  He told us about a lot of new ideas for menu additions and we can't wait to go back and give them a try.  I definitely recommend the garlic knots!!! Everyone go out and try Chef Ronnie B's food and tell him Cindy sent you!  I was so satisfied I think he will remember me!"}
{"text":"Other Yelpers are right.  This place has gone completely downhill.  Hadn't been here in a looonggg time.  The pizza, which was heavenly years ago, is now average or less than average.  Burnt crust?  Check.  Sailing the seas of cheese as Primus sang?  Check.  Current trend of restaurants advertising specials and then giving you the check without recognizing the specials?  Check.  Trying to throw in extra charges on the bill?  Check.  For the last two, as soon as I pointed to the bill, the server said \"oh I forgot to ...\"  Before I even said what was wrong.  $15 special on pizza was $22 on check.  And then the extra $3 charge for a mysterious beer?  WTF?  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.  Brundlefly is at Revolution and he's coming to get you!  Blahhhhhhh ..."}
{"text":"Don't go here for football. I'm new in town saw the come in we have NFL ticket sign I thought I found a place to watch my team. Two quarters into the game the manager changed the game said sorry we have six people at the bar that want to watch a different game and the TVs are connected. Bear in mind Im sitting in the back room. So we took the bill and left. Too bad this won't be a place for me on Sunday."}
{"text":"Took some friends from out of town to Revolution.  We haven't been in a few years, but remembered the pizza being great.  First off the AC was not working in half the building and they had fans running.  They burned our first pizza, and when we asked for another it never came because the cook \"forgot to make it\".  Then we told them we just wanted one to go which took another 30 minutes (bye the way it came out wrong).  We asked the poor waitress where the manager was in all of this.  She told us he/she didn't bother to come into work.  Won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night for trivia night and I was impressed.  Busy, but not crazy.  Lots of wait staff, everyone very friendly and helpful.  Ordered a cheese small pizza with 1/2 pint of cider and a side Caesar salad.  Yummy!  Walked out of there for less than $20, which, for a single person, isn't bad.  If I'd had more to drink the tab would have been a lot higher, and believe me, I was tempted.  Lots of wonderful sounding craft beers and Sangria by the pitcher.  Heaven!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Revolution for beer and a little bit of dinner.  Impressed with the beer options and found the servers attentive and helpful. I'd definitely recommend the Tuesday beer specials because you can try two for the regular cost of one.  

Tried the curry kabob, which was messy but good with the beers.

The restaurant was noisy but it seemed to be enthusiastic dinner groups, which I take to be a good thing."}
{"text":"First things first, I was very much on the fence between 4 and 5 stars.

The pizza was simply AMAZING.  The crackling crispy crust was the best I've had in Charlotte.  All the ingredients (Basil, Tomato, Mozzarella) were great.

Beer selection was great. 

Gelato was delicous

One suggestion for improvement: Off the shelf pizzas (picking out the toppings myself is stressful; give me some options - even if they're only a starting point.)

Also, piece-mealing the topics seemed to result in a pricier pizza than I'd expected."}
{"text":"I give up. I've had two terrible experiences with this place and refuse to go back ever again. 

The first time was on a Friday night a few months ago. A group of about 8 of us went in about 1030 and the place was clearing out, guess that shoulda been my warning. The server was attentive and brought out drinks promptly and then advised us we could only order off a certain part of the menu since it was late. I guess 11 counts as late here on a friday. Ok no biggie, Margherita pizza sounds fine. 3 of us ordered this. What came out was more caprese salad on a cold hard piece of flat bread than a hot pizza. Cold tomato and mozzarella slices with arugula garnish. Look I applaud trying to get all bougie but warn your patrons. I would not have ordered had I known. When I expressed my dissatisfaction to the server he just shrugged and said \"sorry, that's how it comes\" and walked away. Yep, that made me mad. 

When I returned home from my trip I did send an email just to express my displeasure. The manager was very apologetic and a few days later a gift certificate unexpectedly showed up in the mail. Wow, ok, I'll give it another shot.

Last night was that second chance and they failed miserably. I walked in on a Wednesday at 10:03pm. The hostess said sorry, kitchen just closed. I said I'm bringing in a group of 12 people, but I guess we can just drink this gift certificate so asked I could use it for that. She responded that I'd have to ask the owner, he's standing right there. Um, no, i don't work here. Not my job to ask. So I got a \"nod\" and went to the bar where I said I'll have several people drinking on this gift certificate and here's a card to secure the rest. The bartender told me that they close in 30 minutes and shrugged her shoulders like she didn't want to deal with this. Really?? I'm so frustrated at this point I walked out. I can't even give you money? The owner was standing right there, shoulda said something. But instead I voted with my wallet and went down the street and rang up a $200 tab. I've given you two chances. I won't give you any more next time I'm traveling through Charlotte. By the way, I know it's September and should be cool, but it isn't and thus your AC should be on. It was ridiculously hot in there."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza. The selection of toppings is very impressive. The finishing oil (I got truffle oil) was a nice touch. Great beers too!  If you like gourmet pizza, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice: first time for a snack and the second time for pizza.  Both times were really good. One of the best things about this place is their gelato bar, which Mike particularly likes, but I do too since they have a bunch of different options.

The pizza was a bit soggy in the center, so it's tricky to just pick up and eat.  They have a lot of interesting toppings that you can select from -- I tried banana peppers on my pizza for the first time.  It was good!  Their Italian sausage wasn't my favorite -- I was expecting bigger, juicier pieces of sausage, and it was a bit more like ground beef. 

The antipasta, or \"antipizza\" as they call it, was really tasty!  I thought it would be better if there were a bit more on it, but for a snack, it worked. 

Finally, they have a decent beer selection -- they do pitchers or pints and you select from three price points: for pints, they're $2, 4, and 6.  Only PBR makes the $2 list...shocker."}
{"text":"The pizza and the beer selection here are great.  You can get a really basic pie or something off beat.  The nice thing about this place is that you not only get a really chill place to go eat but you get a lot more options for your pizza than you do at most other places."}
{"text":"This place gets points for a great draft beer selection and being in NoDa. Frankly I'm a traditional pizza girl and these are more like artisan pizzas. At times the crust is so crispy it is like eating a cracker. 

The service is always great. They have the prettiest gelato but I have not tried it.  There is not a lot to choose from in the area so this place is a definite stand out.  A decent place to grab a bite but I would not make a special trip."}
{"text":"I will never go back. Hadn't been in a year or so. Has totally gone down hill. I'm not that picky, but worst pizza I've ever had. Beer was flat. Tasted like sour apple juice. Needless to say, I left hungry."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots to relax, eat delicious pizza, and sip delicious beer. Well, I went in the other day and everything had changed. First of all, they put ridiculous white tablecloths on all the tables...who do they think they are? I go there to drink beer with my friends, not go on some 5 star business lunch or something. Plus the tablecloth kind of got in the way in the booth-style tables. Makes no sense. But whatever. The reason why I am giving Revolution 2 stars is that THEY REMOVED MY FAVORITE PIZZA FROM THE MENU. It was the Rosemary Potato pizza, and it was awesome. They changed the menu, but did not keep the old favorites of their clientele. They had a kind of similar pizza but they said they would not put potatoes on it because that pizza was Off the Menu. Please, Revolution, if you are reading this, PUT THE ROSEMARY POTATO PIZZA BACK ON THE MENU. Go back to the way you were! There was nothing wrong with you! You were great!! 

Side note: seems like they are always out of Allagash White when I go...what's up with that? 

Anyway. Revolution, please change back. Please. I dream about the Rosemary Potato pizza all the time and it is one of the small pleasures of my life when I go eat it at Revolution with my friends. Would you rob a person of this experience forever? Would you really???"}
{"text":"I think my husband and i have given this place three chances now. third time is the charm, we will not go back. my husband went in today in the afternoon, and all he got was a small pizza and one beer. the pizza took almost an hour to come out, and it was only four slices. he finished the beer before he even got the pizza. and also the bartender who worked today was clearly more interested in what music was playing on his iPod, than in his customers or his customer service. my husband had the pizza for 10 minutes and was ready to cash out right when he got the pizza, but no one would pay attention. and yeah, they have a lot of taps, but no good beer. no thanks Revolution, no thanks."}
{"text":"Excellent beer menu (cant beat $3 NC beer night on Tuesdays). 
We had the Revolution pizza (basically a supreme pizza) and it was also excellent. The only loss of a star was for a couple small misses (forgot to put in an appitizer in and also missed the removal of a few ingredient changes requested) by the server. Also, the decor inside feels boring and dated."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Revolution in several years so we thought we'd give it another visit while out in NoDa this weekend. We were SO disappointed in our food. The service was awesome (hence the extra star) so no complaints there, but our pizza was beyond soggy and greasy. It was practically mush. It seems as though the oven wasn't hot enough, thus leaving us with a crust that was liquified. We had placed another order for a take out pizza and that one wasn't nearly as greasy, but also looked pale and undercooked. Even a rewarming in our oven couldn't save it. The crust oozed through the grates on our oven rack. Made a total mess and was inedible. I see we aren't the only ones who have experienced this lately. What's going over there at Revolution?"}
{"text":"These guys have good food (if you get a pizza) and a wide beer selection.  Definitely a must stop in noda."}
{"text":"While certainly not the best pizza I've ever eaten, it's definitely not bad pizza.  The list of standard pizzas is creative, and customers have the option to create their own pizza.  I ordered the 10\" Demeter:  portabello mushrooms, oven-dried tomatoes and goat cheese.  The pizza was supposed to be drizzled with olive oil, but apparently opted for taking a bath in the oil instead.  I love olive oil, but it was just a bit much for me.  The beer selection here is pretty fantastic, offering great American craft brews and a fairly extensive list of local (NC) craft brews.  The beer alone gives me reason to visit Revolution again."}
{"text":"The husband and I rolled into this restaurant to catch a football game and drink a lovely draft beer. We are now HUGE fans of the this place! The staff is friendly, the bartender knows his beers, and was kind enough to let us a sample a few to make our choice. The pizza was FANTASTIC!! The crust was thin and perfectly cooked. They have a great micro-beer selection and from the advertisements they have good weekday specials."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! I love this place...!! Sat outside this weekend and had a great time! I had the Demeter Pizza which was SOOOOO GOOOOODDD...I would highly recommend!! Also, their beer selection is off the chain, a lot of local brews...had the Carmel Gelato, and it was AMAZING!! Love the area, food-quality ingredients, and beers. Check them out! =)"}
{"text":"Revolution has some excellent food, 40ish different beers on tap, and friendly bar & waitstaff. I also love their specials - Thursday is Pint Night, with almost all pints available for $3, and Tuesday is \"date night\" - an appetizer to share OR two side salads, a medium two-topping pizza, and a gelato to share, all for $20! Can't be beat. 

Otherwise, though, things are a little pricey. My biggest complaint: They don't have any house pizzas - so everything is build-your-own (and every item is charged). This means that the cost of a single pizza can skyrocket if you're not careful."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed - ordered artichoke spinach dip - came in a thimble sized cup - pita triangles greasy - soup was ok - still very small portions.  Too many other places around with larger and better portions."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers. I had the garlic bread rolls, which were really good. Apparently their pizza is legit too."}
{"text":"Place seems pretty understaffed... Went around dinner time and place didn't seem too packed out. After standing around for awhile some leggy kid comes up and \"yeah uh we are on like a 15 minute wait\" just kind of fell out of the side of his mouth. Sucks. I wanted pizza."}
{"text":"We are from the St. Louis area and came to Charlotte for a football game. We just happened to walk by this place and decided to give it a try. The service was great and the food was excellent. Great home made chips, awesome pizza with perfectly crispy crust, and the Angus burger was amazing. Thank you to Tony and Rob for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The revolution chicken (grilled chicken walnut pesto pasta w/ arugula salad)  was very good.  They have a covered patio which is dog friendly.   Good beer selection, including local craft beers.  The NoDah section of town looks cool & artsy."}
{"text":"So this is kind of smashing two reviews into one.  The first is for Revolution Pizza, which I would give a 3.5.  And the second is for Revolution Ale House, which I would give a 4.5.  I got out my trusty calculator, and evidently (3.5+4.5)/2=4, so I am giving this place a 4.

I didn't live in Charlotte for a long time, but I got the impression that Revolution was the best place for beer snobbery in town.  A good-sized list with a very good selection (unlike somewhere like Flying Saucer, which has a huge list, but a ton of filler, not to mention sub-par food).  I don't really remember what beers I had there aside from an Allagash White, but everything was good, and thankfully served in room temperature glasses.  A little hard to hail down a bartender, but once I succeeded she was very friendly and helpful.

As for the food, it was good, and vegetarian friendly.  I had their Margherita pizza both times, and while it wasn't the best I've ever had it was quite tasty.  The balsamic reduction definitely gave it a welcome boost.  But its been a while since I've been there, and after just looking at their online menu, it seems like they have more vegetarian items than they used to.  4 of their 9 signature pizzas are veg-friendly, and their Mushroom Fettucine sounds great. 

 Prices were a little higher than I liked, beer and food, worth it for the beer and not really that bad for the food.  Service is OK, seemed a little disorganized, but everyone was ultimately friendly and helpful.  Nice decor, in a large, old house.

Looking at their online menu (not to mention beer selection) has me wanting to go back next time I'm in Charlotte, so perhaps they will hit that magic 5 stars next time!!!


Note:  So I just had another look at the beer list, and all of their drafts are local.  Now I have no problem with supporting local beer, but I could have sworn that they used to have taps of Bell's, Rogue, Allagash,etc., and maybe even a few Belgians. They do have some bottles from Allagash, Bell's, Dogfish, etc. For me personally, a beer bar without a good  Belgian selection is not really a beer bar (one Chimay red bottle and some local knockoffs don't cut it)."}
{"text":"Great wings, good pizza if you like NY or brick oven and pretty good selection of gelato. Pets are welcomed on the patio."}
{"text":"It's... ok. Bland and half-assed but not completely inedible. Maybe it's better when you're drunk?

I went after the lunch rush on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. 

Friend ordered the soup de jour: tomato roasted red pepper and the lamb burger. I ordered the antipasto platter.

The soup was thick, too thick for soup. Too thick even for spaghetti sauce. The flavor was fine, but I suspect that all they did was take some of the regular soup (tomato bisque), add a handful of roasted peppers and give it some immersion blender. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it was very poorly executed. 

The lamb burger was served well done (my friend was not asked how she wanted it cooked) and the tzatziki relish was bland. The burger came with no sides whatsoever. Even the presence of (a small bit of) feta added no much needed saltiness. The ciabatta roll the burger was served on was dry and crumbly with none of the springy chewiness to it you expect from ciabatta.

My antipasto platter wasn't any better. Old and sticky \"italian\" deli meat that had long since lost it's flavor, cold pita triangles, 2 slices of ok tomatoes with a nice sized slice of mozzarella (no basil, no salt, some black pepper?, no olive oil, no balsamic reduction), a few cornichons (wha?), a tiny wedge of brie (huh?), a couple of \"mixed olives\", a triangle of an aged, nicely salty (finally seasoning!) cheese of indeterminate  but vaguely \"italian\" origin. The condiments were a sweet green (pepper?) sauce, a huge blob of whole grain dijon (much more than necessary especially considering there wasn't even any sausage on the plate), and some pickled sliced banana peppers. The \"seasonal\" vegetables were about 5 pickled green beans.

For dessert my companion had the nutella pie and I had the tiramisu cheesecake. They were good, probably the only part of the meal that didn't disappoint. Still, there's probably better places to grab dessert and if an Alehouse can't even make a decent burger there's something very wrong going on."}
{"text":"I have walked to this place several times, and the pizza is great!  It says they deliver - even better, but wait..I call on a Sunday night, well within opening times, and I am told they don't deliver tonight?  If a customer calls for delivery, and your business says it will deliver, I believe a reason should be given at least."}
{"text":"Good customer service, clean, and nice location. I had the caprese salad and it was amazing! Also had a bite of the Greek salad and taste of the tomato bisque, both of which were very tasty. Price was really reasonable and I would go back."}
{"text":"We tried this joint out because we purchased a Groupon. Really enjoyed the Blueberry Ale, but as for the pizza - IMO, only worth it with a Groupon."}
{"text":"So glad this wasn't our first visit to Revolution because we should have left. Except...our server Chris went to great effort to try and \"save\" our experience. We went for girls night traveling from South Charlotte and walked into a sauna. Apparently they were having problems with their AC. The hostess told us that the back room wasn't too bad so we decided to stay. We were bothered the entire time by unexplained 
Nats buzzing around us during our entire meal. They were beyond annoying as we tried to swat them away throughout our meal! yuck! Chris was very helpful with us selecting beer and even brought us samples to try. Unfortunately, our beer was not cold at all! Chris said it was due to the AC issue and they were having trouble keeping the kegs cold. Taking our first sip of warm beer was so disappointing! Again, we should have left but Chris was trying to accommodate us and brought glasses of ice we could set our beers in to help make them colder. Nice thought, but it didn't work.  Thank goodness our pizza arrived quickly. We got the Ogre which was fantastic! One of the most unusual and delicious pizzas I have had! It's a white pizza with prosciutto, avocado  and a cracked egg on top! YUM!!
We will return again since we've had good experiences in the past, but in the future....don't even attempt to serve warm beer to your customers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. When we went yesterday they had 42 beers on tap! The best part is that with their \"Pick a flyer\" option, you can try a sampler of 4 different beers in 6 oz glasses for only $8, which is so reasonable. The pizza is also amazing and the service was wonderful. We went a little earlier than typical dinner hours and didn't wait at all but we noticed that when we left there was a huge wait for tables. Luckily, with so many great beers on tap, it would probably make the wait not seem as bad. I will definitely be back to Revolution."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it a zero. Didn't even get a chance to try the food. We were seated and NO ONE brought us water or even acknowledged we were there. My daughter tried to flag down 3 different waiters who were oblivious that we were sitting there without drinks while two other tables were sat and drinks were brought to them and orders placed. Very disappointed.   Angry enough that when I brought it to the attention of the manager that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it.  Will most likely never return."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with pizza and beer (one has to make an effort to screw it up, granted some have). They have a great selection of beer and a variety of different pizzas to choose from. One can also create their own, but I went with the pig meat one. When the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside, which I did. My pizza was good and the service was fine."}
{"text":"Revolution Pizza has the makings of a five-star review on its hands, but it's not quite there yet.

The best part about this place is the toppings. There are traditional toppings like bell peppers and pepperonis, but there are also opportunities to get more creative and adventurous, like oven-dried tomatoes and pancetta. Some of their pork is provided by Grateful Growers, too! An expansive beer list and tasty, rotating gelato flavors complete the experience.

But they get a star off because the crust just isn't there. It's flavorless and crispy, almost like a water cracker. Which some say doesn't matter when the toppings are amazing, but those toppings could be elevated with better crust--at least crust with flavor!

They also lose a star for spotty service. On one of our visits, we got up and left after waiting for 20 minutes to be greeted. Unacceptable. If the pizza weren't so good, we'd never have been back."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Revolution and have waited a couple of weeks to write my review because of this. A friend of mine had heard some really great things about Revolution and after reading through some Yelp reviews, I thought I would give it a shot. 

First of all, I love the look of the restaurant. The vibe is really fantastic and inviting. Were were seated in a closed in porch so it was sort of like sitting outside but with the comforts of air conditioning. Here is where it starts to get aggravating, our waitress told us nothing about the menu and offered no suggestions. She was very nice and had a smile on her face but she didn't even tell us about the specials which we found ourselves on a random blackboard after we had already ordered. 

The drink selection is great so if nothing else, stop by for drinks. Mixed drink and beer pitchers are offered so that is definitely a nice touch. The problem is that they were running out of a lot of beers and it was only 7 o'clock! I was a little puzzled by this considering how early it was in the evening. We decided to forgo an appetizer and split a salad instead. We ordered the wedge and were really happy with it. The blue cheese was very fresh and we were given a huge helping of it. The lettuce was crisp and the buttermilk dressing was really great. 

When it came to ordering a pizza, I was pretty much lost. There are no pre-concieved concoctions to choose from on the menu so you just have to pick a basic cheese pizza and add everything yourself. The toppings are so incredibly overpriced! The basic cheese pizza is certainly not cheap to begin with so you end up spending 20 bucks on a medium pizza with three or four toppings! It is certainly one of the most expensive pizzas in Charlotte. Once we decided on our toppings and the pizza was delivered, I was a bit underwhelmed. It tastes about the same as your neighborhood pizza joint just with \"fancier\" toppings. 

Our bill came and I was shocked to see that my friend and I spent almost 50 bucks and split everything! I would consider going back to Revolution for the atmosphere but I would certainly forgo the pizza in favor of apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Decided to go with my favorite specialty pizza \"Chicken Bacon Ranch.\" They actually use pancetta instead of bacon which was a very nice touch. After 2 bites I knew....best specialty pizza I've ever tasted. So flavorful. I'm a true southerner and dip everything in ranch and even their ranch was unique and delicious. They have over 40 beers on tap including local and seasonal. Will definitely be back for pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"Well, mixed opinions I guess.... Pizza was great, once we got it. Server was fantastic. I didn't have to ask where the pizza was, she was on it. She returned to our table a few minutes later to let us know they had to remake it. She offered us suitable quick option ( beer) while we waited again. If something goes wrong, the kitchen has to talk to someone. Manager needs to visit the table to resolve. It's a simple concept. Table behind us also had pizza made wrong. Their server was pissed, since someone else brought the pizza out. No manager in sight all night, which means they hadn't recognized the 20 tables I was in view of. Communication is key. Work with your employees and your customers. Our check would've been double - the tip always is! Will return...."}
{"text":"Imagine my dismay as I approach this primo location in NODA to discover it's no longer Mellow Mushroom.  Boy, I'm behind the times these days!  I brush off my disappointment and charge ahead, unknowing of course that additional disappointment would ensue.

My b*tch list:
- The place was EMPTY, yet we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.
- The high chair we were given was broken, and we were advised just to \"tie in\" the toddler with two mangily straps hanging off the chair.
- We ordered drinks, and beers.  We received water and no beer.  After waiting 30 minutes for the drinks to be brought to us, we eventually got up and went straight to the bar to get them.
- Food order was majorly screwed up.  Of our party of 4, each one of us received a meal that did not match our order.  We sent the waiter back and forth 4 times before our orders arrived as requested.
- The side salads we ordered with the meal all came in different sizes.  Of all four of us, two received a huge salad stuffed into a tiny bowl.  The other two received a huge bowl with a tiny salad.  How do you screw up a side salad?!
- Burgers are AWFUL!  Seriously, I took one bite and stopped.
- If you expect your meal to arrive with all the items as described on the menu, think again.  Apparently, the menu is not wrong - but you are wrong if you ask your waiter for the missing ingredients.

The list goes on, but I'll stop here to save on the over embarrassment of the establishment.  It was a pitiful meal and a terrible experience.  

Please oh please bring back Mellow Mushroom!  This place is the pits!"}
{"text":"Here's how cool this place is: we arrived at 1:30 pm & the door was locked. Hmm, it's Friday & it says open at 11:30. Someone comes rushing to the door, opens it & says \"we open at 4\" oh you don't do lunch anymore? Just this month, he says, come back in October. Awww but I wanted pizza now! Ah, we can make you pizza. I'm like are you serious? He says to another guy - you can make pizza? Sure. And we can have beer too? Yes, come in. He lets us in, locks the door behind us & produces full food & beer menus. He tells me his name is Anil (not sure of spelling - pronounced ah-kneel) & I find out later he's the owner (not the manager as we had speculated). Needless to say the P&B were awesome. Oh and we met the manager & he was also such a great guy. Great people, great food & \"above the call of duty service\"."}
{"text":"I love Revolution pizza.....great food, great beer, great location. 

Drinks:
They have drink specials posted by the bar. There is always $3 wells and then the beers change around. They have a pretty decent list of microbrews....slightly pricey but you pay for what you get. If you wanna pay $2, get a Bud Light :)

Food:
So being the only pizza place in Noda, we frequent this place a good bit. I personally would not go here and order some plain cheese and pepperoni pizza. They are known for their specialty pizzas! I think the NODA is the best on the menu (pulled pork with a balsamic reduction). Last week we got Revolution and, while it was delicious, the garlic sauce was a little too much!

Location:
Great location in Noda!! If there is a wait, go hop to a bar in the area! The parking, as it is Noda, is not the best. We always just park on the side of the road somewhere.

Service:
The service here is pretty good. Never really had any issues at all....though, I am not the pickiest of people. One time I ordered a beer they had on special and they were out...I then proceeded to order another beer on special and the waiter came back saying they were out. Then, he just told me to order any beer on the menu and he would charge me like it was the special. That was nice and appropriate. 

Overall, we will definitely continue coming back!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite before a show at the Neighborhood Theater, and was very impressed.  I had the cheeseburger pizza, and it floored me!  I really liked the crust; I see a lot of reviewers thought it was too cracker-like, but I didn't get that at all.  Mine was moist, chewy, and crisp at the same time.  The pizza sauce base was ketchup and mustard, with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and ground beef.  Every other 'Cheeseburger' pizza I've had has just been ground beef on a regular pizza.  

My wife had the Falafel, which was outstanding as well.  

Service was very friendly, and we received our dinner and drinks very quickly for a place that was slammed on a Saturday night.  

They also have a ton of beers on tap, and some really good looking gelato (I didn't have time to try it before the show.)

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu choices!"}
{"text":"How genius are half-pint drink orders?

SO GENIUS.

Seriously, I *never* order beer in a restaurant because A) I am not a beer drinker and B) I don't know what kind of beer I like (corollary to A). I'm always afraid of getting stuck with a giant glass of something I hate, and feeling like I wasted my money in the process.

Not here. For a mere $2.50 I was able to order a glass of something that sounded interesting and not worry about the possible waste (for the record, it was the NoDa NoDajito. Also, I really liked it.) Another sample glass of a slightly more expensive offering gave me an 8 once pour of Dogfish Head Festina Peche for $3.25. Not too shabby. And I was SO HAPPY to be able to join Husband in having a beer, for once.

We were both really pleased with our pizza orders, as well. I went with a small/10\" 4 topping ($11.50) red-sauce-base  with artichokes, roasted red & yellow peppers, mixed sauteed mushrooms and kalamata olives.  The sauce tasted really fresh, and the veggie toppings were both ample and well-balanced. I didn't notice more than one type of mushroom on my pizza, but I may have been nomming it too quickly to tell. The pizza didn't exhibit an overabundance of cheese, compared to some places, but you know like the song says: sometimes you feel like cheese, sometimes you don't.  I will say my meal was borderline too salty, but I'm not sure if that was due to one of the core components, or if it was just the toppings I picked (i.e. artichokes and olives, both of which can be extra briny). The crust was awesome, too - both chewy and crackly-crisp. There were some small spots of char, which you may or may not like (I do), but overall just a really, really great texture and flavor. I ate almost all of my crusts, which is rare for me.

Husband's white pie (olive oil + garlic base) with prosciutto, mushrooms and fresh arugula looked really good too, not that I'd know firsthand, since he wouldn't share. Thing of note: the prosciutto was cubed. I've only ever seen it thinly-sliced/shaved on a pizza before, so that was news to me.

We don't make it over to the NoDa side of town as often as we should or would like. Now that we've sampled Revolution's offerings, though, maybe we'll start coming up with more reasons to visit."}
{"text":"I have lived in NoDa for over 4 years and have watched this restaurant decline severely.  It is soooooo gross inside, food is lack luster, and the beer is always flat.   

rumor has it that the new management is aware of how bad Revolution has gotten and refuses to upgrade or fix anything (like the Air conditioner... they have NOT had AC in 3 years), because they are just waiting for the lease to run out and be bought out like the rest of NoDa.  

I will never give my money to this place ever again until they put some money back into what the restaurant USED to be!"}
{"text":"Wow. We Should have known the service and food was gonna be subpar when we were sat down in back of the restaurant by the broken leaking AC unit. k. 

But honestly,the service was terrible. We got no refill and waited 30 mins for a pizza margarita! At 1pm the restaurant wasn't busy AT ALL. In fact the whole shopping plaza was pretty dead...I wish we had gone else where but anyway when the pizza finally arrived it didn't look anything like the menu described it.

First off the \"diced tomatos\" were big thick uncooked slices,the cheese was spread totally uneven and undercooked as well and they haphazardly threw so much basil on half of the pizza I thought they must be trying to garden it. And the pizza was DRY. And I get it,it's not supposed to be saucy but y'all could have put some olive oil on it or something! There is no need for the pizza to be bone dry like that. I have never been so disrespected by a pizza in my life lol! Ended up ordering something else because that pie was just not gonna fly. The waitress obviously wished we weren't there because she never brought us refills and we only saw her 3 times in the HOUR were there. (30 mins for the first pizza,30 mins for the remake) not to mention all the TVs were off and there was not music playing so it's not like we even got to hear any of the cool tunes this place is known for. What a waste. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love their specialty pizzas! Ask for a pepperoni pizza with a ranch \"swirl.\" Confession: I seriously order a large for myself just so that I have more to take home with me. They have lots of beers on draft, and great specials. I don't know how long they'll have it, but I had an awful cold the last time I was in and they had a drink called the \"salted caramel hot toddy\"-- it consisted of hot apple cider infused with caramel vodka, rimmed with salt and it made my throat feel so much better and was absolutely delicious. I've been here several times and recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great drink specials.  Good food?  Wouldn't know.

Waited 20 minutes to get hummus that never came.  Service is slow.  Very slow.  There are so many other good places in noda.  Skip this one.

They were kind enough about the delay, but I would still go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to eat and drink...it was mellow mushroom then changed to revolution...when it first became Revolution Ale House you couldn't beat the place for a \"different\" kind of pizza and lots of selections of beers...I have tried to keep going back thinking eventually whoever owns the place will catch on and realize that his cooks don't care anymore, but after several years, I just have to face it. This place sucks now, the prices are too high, the beer is warm and the owner doesn't care...he's in NODA and thats the only reason people go, the other restaurants that serve good food get busy, and he gets the over flow...I'm done, not going back and it p*sses me off because I liked this place.
On top of that, he's now too cheap to fix the A/C. Let's hope he shuts down and someone that enjoys good food opens it back up
If I could give no stars i would, the only reason it rates one star is some of the wait staff"}
{"text":"3$ for a sour beer on a Saturday night and a loaded Revolution Pizza with pepperoni, onion, green peppers, mozzarella, mushroom, sausage, and ricotta hit the spot! The perfect meal to end vacation and put you in route to a diet. Our server was awesome and we didn't have to wait for a table. I'll be sure to visit again when I'm
Back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I still love Revolution but I had to update to include my new favorite dish, the mushroom fettuccine.  It's made with various 'shrooms, oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, truffle oil, fresh pasta, and nice spicy arugula on top.  So, so, so yummy!  Love this place, including the atmosphere, food, and kick ass beer selection!  I would hate to see it fall victim to the same fate as the Mellow Mushroom or Moondog's, so please everyone go visit!"}
{"text":"Tried Revolution out a few years ago and didn't have the greatest experience... they were out of feta cheese and the crust to topping area of my pizza was WAY to high.

Fortunately, the Living Social gods saw fit for me to give them a second try by offering up a coupon. $15 for $30 worth of food.

We sat on the patio deck which was pretty nice, setting sun and warm breeze, ahhhh.

Our server was super sweet, but had no idea what the hell she was doing. I felt like I had to hold her hand through taking our order and give her a pat on the back when she fixed the things she botched up. I don't know if she was new or just an airhead, but I couldn't hold it against her because she seemed sweet.

My boyfriend and I settled on the bruschetta appetizer and a large pizza with feta, kalamata olives, and oven roasted tomatoes  (they don't have sun dried).

The appetizer was decent. Small and a little salty. Not the best bruschetta I've had, but not the worst either. Don't regret the choice, but probably wouldn't order it again.

The pizza was also decent. Like my first visit, the crust ratio was a little too high for my taste and a little to hard/chewy but the rest of the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good pizzas.  Team trivia on wed night is fun.  On sat they have $3 beers in cans with a good selection.  I like the patio for dogs!"}
{"text":"The pizza is to die for! I love the way the menu is set up, it really lets you feel creative. They also have really good apps. Plus an awesome beer selection. The speed of service from both front and back of house leaves a little to be desired, but its worth it."}
{"text":"Our friend Amy brought in some food from Revolution and I was floored because I have refused to eat anything from them ever since my poor pizza experience but this chicken kabob dish was just too good to believe.  Actually went back over there and ordered another one for us and it was equally as good at the first.  I suspect things have changed and thanks to this excellent chicken dish I'm planning on trying a pizza again soon.  Bravo Revolution!"}
{"text":"You can get less expensive pizzas from any number of places in town, but IMHO Revolution's is the best. The crust is excellent and the toppings are fresh and generous. I'm compelled to Yelp today because of a bad situation that they handled very well: a lost called-in take-out order. I arrived 20 min after calling it in and there was no record of it in the system. They apologized, asked me to wait 20 more minutes, then comped a large 4-topping pizza and a small cheese pizza (the bill was about $30). I expected a little something for their error - the host took the order, handed it to a bartender, and it was lost - but I didn't expect my entire bill to be comped. The manager handled this situation very well."}
{"text":"Pizza's are delicious:

Drunken Goat: Gouda cheese with a delicious beer glazing.  So much good stuff here.  The ogre pizza is great too, with white sauce, and avocado!

Definitely try the beer glaze wings as well.

Beer selection on tap is endless.  A good selection of nitro's too.

All in all a great place with good value."}
{"text":"A solid 4. 

I have been here a few times and it's generally really good.

The artisan menu has some unique items that you wouldn't find at any ordinary pizza shop. 

The extensive beer selection ups my rating too. Lots of local craft selections.

It's in a convenient location in a cute old house from the Victorian era. This alone would entice me to go here if I walked past it on the street. The ambiance is golden.

The pizza pies are a good size: large but no huge. The toppings are awesome. They supposedly serve truffle oil as a topping but they were out of it when I was there.

The few negatives: wait times can get lengthy and the pizza can get expensive especially if you're choosing the build your own option....each topping is a whopping $2.

Bartenders are great but the waitstaff isn't incredible. We had to remind our waitress to bring a few items and we did not get our margarita pitcher we ordered with drinks until the end of dinner. Otherwise this place would be a five star rating!"}
{"text":"A pizza topped with potatoes?? Kill me b/c I am in carb heaven! A groupon led me to Revolution however I've always been intrigued by it's ginormous patio right in the heart of NoDa. I went last night and was very pleased with everything--food, beer, service, atmosphere. 

I can't believe I'm saying this but I felt like there were too many beers to choose from. I was in complete overload and was all \"Whoa\" ala Joey Lawrence on Blossom. Our table all wanted Sweetwater Blue which was perfect since they serve pictures for $12. That came out to a beer and a half for three people so that worked. The bruschetta was fantastic-simple and light with more of a balsamic emphasis. 

And then the pizza happened. When I saw their signature pizzas, I couldn't decide. While reading the description of the Cheeseburger pizza, I may have thrown up in my mouth. However, all the other ones sounded divine. Our table got the Potato and Rosemary Pizza which was complete with caramelized onions and goat cheese. I would eat a homeless man's shoe if it was covered in goat cheese so I was giddy with the abundance of goat cheese. The pizza was tasty and perfect for a warm, summer night. Add a few pitchers of beer and an attentive server and you bet your potatoes I will be back. Now the question is will I be back for the pizza, beer or gelato bar? 

PS -Dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Pizza is incredibly greasy :("}
{"text":"Pizza isn't why you go to Revolution (and maybe food period - haven't been such a fan), but the beer selection -- featuring predominantly North Carolina craft breweries -- makes this a favorite bar of mine in NoDa. Nice people, too. The service is top notch...

This started as a 3-star review, but I'm going to bump it to a 4-star, with the service being the dividing line..."}
{"text":"I've given this place 2 tries, and while it is ok, I probably won't be back. The first time we tried the margherita on cracker crust, which was a little low on flavor but fresh tasting so ok, and the rosemary potato pizza. The potatoes were not cooked enough, making the top a soft potato mess. Not enough salt and pepper could fix what was lacking. 

Today we got the Revolution (sort of an everything pizza) and a make your own (caramelized garlic, jalapeños, goat cheese). The Revolution comes with a Parmesan garlic sauce drizzled over the top which you don't see until you pick up a slice and there is a puddle of oil on your plate, sogging up the crust. The garlic/jalapeño/goat cheese pizza was better. 

I should have noticed from the other yelp photos, but revolution leaves a lot of crust around the edges free of sauce/toppings/cheese. It's a bummer."}
{"text":"I visited the NoDa area which has a lot of great local bars and this place had a nice porch section which drew me in. I ended up sitting at the bar and must have come on a bad day as either the owner or manager was helping out behind the bar but seemed to do more harm then good-the other bartender was complaining to me the entire time.  He got my order wrong and they brought me out a pizza instead of the salad I ordered. The pizza did look delicious and I would like to give this place another try and go back for pizza and a beer.  They have a great beer selection and I went with a local North Carolina raspberry wheat.  Anyway my correct salad order was brought out and they gave me the large salad instead of the small for their mistake which was very nice. The Cesar salad came with bacon, croutons, and cheese was tasty."}
{"text":"This is a \"must go to\" spot if you like great pizza, yummy apps, and a wonderful selection of beer. The pizza is a bit pricy (avg $14 for a large), but if you can manage it do it! You won't regret it! 

Also, if you are in NoDa on a Thursday and enjoy beer this is your stop! They have $3 drafts for any beer 8% or lower. The staff is great! Always nice, energetic, and can make an awesome beer suggestion. All in all, if you are wondering to eat here or not,  choose to EAT/DRINK here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and Wednesday night trivia. First thing I noticed is that the place was a bit expensive for pub grub. Unfortunately the quality did not justify that: Some in our group ordered appetizers, which looked unappetizing and also pretty greasy. I did not try their pizza there, but it did not look very fresh. People in our group were reasonably happy with it though. 

I probably made the best choice that I could have made for myself and got a small antipasti plate as an entree. That had some good stuff on it and was reasonably priced. 

As for TRIVIA, the host was a bit lackluster, and the trivia questions were 90 percent sports and pop culture. If you want real general knowledge trivia, better go to a place that does Team Trivia (that's a company that does trivia games around town), like Brixx or Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, tons of beer on tap.  Service can be meh but who cares about that when you have homemade ranch in your face."}
{"text":"So the beer selection on tap is great, but overpriced. It was nice to sit outside on the patio. I ordered the grilled  Margherita  pizza and it was awful. Globs of cheese and oily tomatoes fell off when I picked it up and stained my shorts for the rest of the day. The crust was absolutely dreadful and tasteless. When you think of thin crust pizza you do not expect dried out cracker thin crust. The other signature pizzas they offer all looked terrible and unappetizing too. One pizza has a ketchup and mustard base, YUCK! I didn't discover until after that a pint which would cost me 4 to 5 dollars anywhere else cost 7.50 here. This place is not worth visiting."}
{"text":"Epic place to end vacation. There's an extensive draft list to pick from, tons of local brews, but the three of us chose to booze out on some Virginia cans. COOL. We split a large Greek salad and a large Revolution pizza. PLENTY of food, in fact way too much, but we couldn't stop eating because it was drool worthy. The pizza was bloody brilliant. Can't say enough. Get it. YUM."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a pizza to go. When I walked in, I asked how long it would take. I was told 15 minutes.  At 30 minutes I asked how long it would be, and was told it was on its way out. At 50 minutes I asked again, and was told they were boxing it up. At an hour, they finally brought out the pizza. Never knew it took 10 minutes to put a pizza in a box. 

Dissatisfied with the service and time. Don't know if I will be back. 

Love NODA. This place has lots of potential, but needs some improvements.

*** as a followup. The Carolina Cyclone pizza was absolutely delicious. * * changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I''d never actually heard about this place before I went (which is hard to believe.) My wife and I walked passed it one morning while getting coffee and I it looked liked a cool place so I finally gave it a try this weekend with a couple of friends. We went on a Saturday night at 8pm ... it was PACKED. If you're in a hurry, I suggest coming early (not going anywhere else, because you'll regret it). We waited about an hour. They have a huge bar area with TONS of different beers, so the hour went by fast as we gulped down $3 special selection beers. 

My buddies and I started off with the Garlic Knots, and then all split 3 different small pizzas. The garlic knots ... ohmygarlicloversrejoice. They're amazing, you will regret not getting them .. probably some of the best ones I've ever had. We split the NoDa, Drunken Goat, and Carolina Calpyso pizzas. Each was very  unique and had incredible flavors, but it was a unanimous decision that the drunken goat was the crowd winner. The different flavors of the ingredients are all matched perfectly, and the sweet beer glaze on top seals the deal. 

Cannot wait to bring my wife back here and show her what I've been raving about since Saturday!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but the Long Island might as well had been a margarita. And water tastes like chlorine. But the garlic knots were amazing!"}
{"text":"Not too bad.  I was expecting a lot more but the pizza was good.  I would go here again but wouldn't ever go out of my way to get there.  Pizza's were enough for most adults but for the price you would expect bigger."}
{"text":"September days, sitting on Revolution's patio drinking wheat beer overlooking North Davidson- worth the visit alone. We ordered a medium, white pizza with fresh mozzarella, house made Italian sausage and( I do what Julia S tells me to,) hot chili oil.  I have to say it was delicious. Our tab wasn't ridiculous, six beers and a medium pizza, $40."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of pizza, and of beer...and pizza and beer. Revolution is just the ticket when you're in NoDa and looking to satiate your buds with the aforementioned. 

Killer beer selection. I've been on many occasions where they've featured casks of specialty brews or has a lineup of local brews. I've heard they've revamped the bar and I'm looking forward to checking it out. 

Pizza choices range from end to end of the spectrum. My favorites, though I'm not sure they offer it year-round, has been the Mexican-style pizza. The plain cheese and veggie options have both been go-to's in the past, too. 

My favorite aspect is the 2nd floor dining. It's nice being \"above\" the streets of NoDa, whether on the patio or inside. It gives you a far and away feel. The interior is awesome, too. Kinda of a trippy experience looking up into the high ceilings. They have a ton of space and it makes me wonder what is up there. Maybe a cool attic? 

Looking forward to heading back again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent specials, the best pizza in noda, very friendly staff and excellent atmosphere. Using words is hard so here is more stuff to fill up space la di do de da de do"}
{"text":"While I was in the area I tried this place out last night . With a name like Revolution Pizza I was expecting funky decor of various political figures through the ages and a pie on the menu named after Che Guerva.

I was completely wrong. It's very nice inside, completely changed atmosphere than mellow mushroom. It's classic & refined, with various italian advertising posters framed on the wall. 

The menu I found a little confusing because pizza's are priced by the size and then per ingredient from basic & premium levels of vegetables, meats, and cheeses. So if you're indecisive there is no pre-printed suggested combinations and if you're on a budget you'll have to do some math to make sure you don't go crazy with the premium toppings. It's the first pizza place I've seen that will add flavored oils which can have a nice touch. Also they have locally sourced vegetables from Grateful Growers on the menu and when the manager came out to check on us she mentioned the dough is made fresh everyday from local milled flour.

If you can't figure out what toppings you want they do have a pizza du jour. Last night it was Shepard's Pie. Yes, shepard's pie pizza. You might not have thought to make it but for a really cold night it was wonderful. It  starts with their soft & crispy crust, a layer of hamburger, carrots, celery then finished with a layer of mashed potatoes applied in ridges like frosting. It was really, really good and quite filling that 2 of us only ate 2/3 of a medium.

Unfortunately we were too full and it was too cold outside to consider the gelato but I will come here again to try them."}
{"text":"I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars for Revolution Pizza and Ale House.  Despite the mediocre food, I decided that the ambience pushed this rating to 3 stars.

I visited this place for the second time three weeks ago on a Friday night during the gallery crawl.  The place was busy, but not too crowded for this agoraphobic Yelper.  Our server was super friendly, but the wait time for pizza was ridiculous.  Their brick oven pizzas are thin crust and rather small for the price.  A $10 pizza should be loaded with toppings and taste somewhat like a gourmet work. The crust was crispy, but the goodness ended there.

I will give them two thumbs up for the beverage selection.  They have an eclectic selection (yep, I used the word eclectic).  The location is perfect as I love NoDa and the atmosphere is like being in your granny's remodeled house.  They even have gelato, strangely enough.

Given the location and ambience however, I am dismayed that something better did replace this former Mellow Mushroom.  I'll likely go back with friends for appetizers and maybe gelato (though never on the same trip), but I wouldn't make it a pizza destination.  Maybe Revolution would be better off dropping the pizza part from their name?  \"Revolution Ale House\" would vastly change my expectations."}
{"text":"Dined at Revolution on Monday evening. I had found a Groupon that was a steal, $27 for $50 worth of food/drink. Since I had out of town guests visiting I figured this would be a perfect pizza treat! Unfortunately our experience left a lot to be desired. The place was absolutely dead for dinner time. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, I have no complaints about the service.  We were sad to find the restaurant was out of what felt like a lot of ingredients: beer cheese & bacon. Our main issue was with the quality of the food ordered We ordered an app of fried pickles which were cut super thin, and over fried, they were crunchy and greasy in a very unappealing way. The garlic knots we ordered, instead of the beer cheese, were good, never had them bad here. The 3 small pizzas we ordered however were awful. Only one was cooked properly, the other two were still doughy in the center, and all three had so much cheese on them that grease from it pooled up on the surface of the pizza. I get it, pizza's a great food, but you could have swam in these pools! The four of us only ate a piece each before asking for to go boxes. Neither couple in the party wanted the oily leftovers (basically our whole meal still), so we tossed what we were forced to go home with soon after. 
I'd been to this location several months ago and thought the food was great! I hope Revolution will hear my whoas and better their products to drive in more customers!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Great beer. Service Is HORRIBLE. Cheers! 15 mins to get beer order. Not busy at all. Waiter dropped off beers and left. We sat with stupid looks on our faces wondering where is he. Went to bar saw him propped on bar doing nothing. Asked to take order. He said, \"where are you guys sitting?\" LOL."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I'm honestly jealous.  I am jealous of all the people that stated they received great food and great service from this place, because I received neither.  I don't know what it is, maybe it's me.  Maybe I omit a foul and detestable odor.  I don't know what it is, but my recent experience here on Saturday, January 7th was as bad as any dining experience I've had at ANY establishment in recent memory...

Upon arriving, my gf and I were seated right away, and a seemingly chill and laid back gentleman took our drink orders immediately.  In fact he was cool enough to inform me that they serve cherry coke as well as regular coke, which I gladly jumped at the chance to order instead.  We were able to place our orders with little issue - I ordered the small pie with pepperoni and pineapple.  My gf ordered some sort of white pizza concoction with chicken and basil or something to that affect.  

When our pizza arrived it was BURNT.  PERIOD.  END OF STORY.  OUR PIZZA WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY BURNT.  I can see if you're an ice cream parlor and you mess up the pizza - OK, I mean pizza isn't your specialty.  But how can YOU BE A PIZZA place and MESS up the PIZZA??!?!?  Due to the UNC vs BC basketball game that was coming on, we didn't have time to complain, we just wanted to be done and out of that place.  

Upon picking through our burnt pizza, my gf and I waited an eternity for our server to finally come back and offer us a box and the check.  I honestly think he forgot about us.  We saw him numerous times attending other tables and clearing other tables, all while seemingly neglecting the table and people that had just received burnt pizza.  Upon FINALLY bringing us our check and a box, we had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for him to come back and take our checks.  When he finally did arrive, my gf and I were already standing up, jackets on and were ready to get the hell out of that place, which to me, also has a slight odor near the fish tank.  

Part of me feels bad about writing this review, because our server, honestly seemed like a nice dude, and I'm sure it wasn't his fault that the pizza was burnt.  In addition, I've been there on a Friday night in the summer of 2011 and had great service and great food.  In fact, it was that experience that made me and my gf want to come back.  However, as smooth as my first experience was at Revolution, my most recent one was just that rocky.  I hope to give this place another shot one day, it just won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great experience overall!  A fellow yelper and I stopped by around 1030 on a Friday night for some food and a beer and the place was full of a young energetic crowd.  We had an awesome waiter who was full of beer suggestions - and my friend didn't even like his first beer and the waiter removed and replaced it free of charge!  You can't get that service everywhere.  As for the food, I ordered a make your own pizza and it was out in an amazingly short amount of time and it was really awesome - perfect for a Friday night food craving, and really quiet cheap for a small.  I'll definitely be back here when I find myself in NoDa and lookin for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Pretty good pizza. The only big knock on them was our service. Our waitress was new or didn't care. Either way, I'll go back when I'm up that way again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and haven enjoyed the pizzas, however tonight's order was very lacking.  Don't know what it was or supposed to be but it sure wasn't pizza dough.  Tasted and looked more like flat bread.  
It should've been a clue that something was wrong when I ordered a small pizza and received a large takeout box.  After getting home and looking at the pizza, a five year old could've done a better job of making the pizza.   Think I'll take my time and money elsewhere for pizza."}
{"text":"The individual pizza's are a great size and have lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place in Noda.......I had a Groupon that was about to expire so my son and I stopped by after church for a quick meal.  I love that they paper down the tables so that kids can just go at it until the food arrives.  We tried the garlic Parmesan wings, chicken fingers w/chips, and the pulled pork signature pizza.  I thought the food was average as the wings and fingers lacked flavor......the homemade chips were dull...the pizza was good, but I could have done without the balsamic dressing.  I would definitely go back for a pizza."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the past three years and it's steadily declined in service and quality. I will say i was cheerfully greeted and several people apologized for the wait (which wasn't long for a Friday night, and didn't bother us at all). However, our sever was lackluster to put it best and I don't think he smiled even once! That's fine though, what really stunk was my calzone- undercooked and raw :( I had them put it back in the oven for a bit which did the trick, but our server just gave a casual \"sorry\" and that was it. I've never had a problem with taste and atmosphere until this recent visit- sadly, I don't think I'll be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"R.I.P. Mellow Mushroom

As a die hard, Mellow Mushroom fan, I knew I had to lower my expectations for Revolution.  I did not realize they would need to be THAT low.  Revolution kept the full bar and the outdoor seating, which would be the only reason to come here.  No upside down furniture from the ceiling, was rather disappointing.

I ordered an Italian sandwich, which was revolting.  Literally, regurgitated it into my napkin.  OK, my first selection wasn't great.  Our waiter was friendly and brought me a slice of plain cheese pizza to hold me over.  This should be good, they are after all, known for their pizza.  Pizza was luke warm, and tasted like something that I could have just heated up out of the frozen pizza isle.

Go to Revolution for BEER ONLY.  I repeat, BEER ONLY.  They have a wonderful beer selection, and they are good about letting you try samples if you are overwhelmed by their inventory.  If you are hungry, don't waste your money on Revolution.  Grab a pint and walk over to Cabo Fish Taco instead."}
{"text":"Everything is made from scratch and delicious . Over 40 beers on tap and not a frown in the house :) the best patio in Noda too"}
{"text":"Lots of good beers here if you are a fan of \"something different\". The first time I went here we had a make your own topping pizza which was delicious. I've been back two or three times since and cant say the pizza was memorable. So I guess its all in what you order. It seems a build your own is better then the predetermined ones. This place used to be a Mellow Mushroom, to me Revolution is like the same thing. 

I love the outdoor patio and the location is great (NODA)"}
{"text":"Service is okay, food is gross. I had the Grilled Margherita- it was thin and burnt crust with globs of old mozzarella in sparse places with maybe a total of four tomato slices on the whole pizza, add basalmic vinegar and shreds of basil and thats it (besides the 12 dollars taken from your wallet). My boyfriend had a calzone, I asked how it was and he said he could have gotten the same from a hot pocket. Great location, okay service, terrible food."}
{"text":"First impression, well this place looks cool. Nice outdoor seating on the corner intersection in NoDa where you can get some good people watching in, and you can bring your dog. 

Pros: Food! I had the wedge salad, delish! I loved the giant candied pecans. I also had the chicken wings in sweet and spicy. Didn't disappoint at all. Decent beer selection.

Cons: Holy crap it was hot as hell in there, I know it wasn't just me because on the way to bathroom (where there was NO AC) there was a hand written sign on the thermostat that said please don't touch. As if a patron once took it upon themselves to help everyone out and turn it down. The service was okay. Luckily we weren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"This review is only for the gelato.  Yes, I also had some beer from the pitchers, and I did see the credit card charges (really, for that?!), but I let everyone else at the table make those decisions (including picking the $$ beer), so I can't be held accountable for remembering what they decided on.

Gelato! Gelato!  We'd started drinking down the street at Dolce Vita, and I'd gotten that salty, bloated beer taste in my mouth.  And I was in the mood for something sweet, but not sugary cocktails.  So I was overjoyed to see the glowing gelato cases as we walked in the front door!  I opted for the cappuccino and hazelnut.  Flavor was amazing and texture was almost as good as what I'd had in Italy.  

I was entertained by the girl who was disappointed that they didn't have Nutella and didn't seem to appreciate my suggestion of getting chocolate and hazelnut.  Seriously, your tongue will notice the difference in texture more than the difference between that and actual Nutella gelato."}
{"text":"I am a total pizza fanatic and while Revolution Pizza may look sorta basic on the outside don't be fooled!  Inside, Revolution is all about thin-crust pizza made with high quality ingredients and great crust.  San Marzano tomatoes?  Check.  In-house grated cheese?  Check.  Ooh, I can't wait!  

We got seated out on the patio for a perfect spring evening.  Revolution's got a great selection of craft beers with a special emphasis on NC brews.  Tonya P and I ordered up a red pie with jalapenos and pepperoni, itsa gonna be a spicy pie, eh?  And 15 minutes later we were digging in...  Now here's where it gets tricky.  Revolution is definitely a thin crust pizza and I'd like to call it a Neapolitan pie.  Where it differs is that its crust was not charred at all, barely even brown.  And the sauce is more of a standard pizza sauce instead of a lightly crushed tomato sauce.  So Revolution dishes out a pie that's sorta between standard NY thin-crust and neapolitan.  But who cares, the pizza here is really good!  You can taste the freshness and quality of the toppings and the thin slices just means you can eat more, yum!  Service was on point all night, very efficient and prompt.  

So go go, Revolution Pizza!  If you're looking for a gourmet slice of thin-crust, you really can't go wrong here.  Just keep it easy on the toppings and let the ingredients shine through.  And I wish I could get a revolution started up in the Triangle area because this place rocks..."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm pregnant, so my food standards are even higher now than normal. If I crave something and go out and buy it and it is not a great version of whatever it is that I was craving, that was a total waste of time because my craving wasn't satisfied and now I have to go find that food item somewhere else. Today I was walking around NoDa and I specifically smelled grilled Margherita pizza, after two hours of not being able to get the thought out of my head, I gave in and order a grilled margherita pizza to go from Revolution. I used to eat here all the time 3 years ago and loved it, so although I have not eaten here in 2 years, I was very excited about my pizza. 

Unfortunately, pregnant or not, this was the most disappointing pizza I've ever had in my life. This is a really tough review for me because I've never given two stars, and because I am a huge fan of everything NoDa, but a bad pizza is a bad pizza. The crust was \"cracker thin\" as advertised, a little too thin for me, but I can't complain because that is exactly how it was described on the menu. But, the proportion of toppings to crust was completely off. The pizza was super dry; Margherita pizza usually has tomato sauce, but this one was completely dry aside from a Balsamic reduction that came on the side. If it had sauce on it, I probably would not have noticed the lack of toppings so much, but 50% of each slice had absolutely nothing on it, so I was just taking big bites of flavorless, dry, cracker-like pizza crust. If that's the flavor I was craving I would've just bought a box of Matzos...The pizza had 3 or 4 tomato slices, 3 or 4 mozzarella slices, and about an ounce of basil to sprinkle on top. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the mozzarella was absolutely delicious, too bad I only had a couple of bites of it. On the bright side, I set aside all of the topping-less cracker crust pieces so I can make breadcrumbs later, so not a total loss..."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food at rev. Also gotta love that King of Pops is usually out front in the summer. Drinks are great, food is awesome, and there is a lot of seating available. The deck/patio is covered and has fans for when you wanna enjoy the spring/summer weather.

The calzones are dream worthy, and they have many specialty pizzas for the vegetarian. Service has always been great, with one exception of a less than friendly waiter. Everyone has their bad days, though! They often have local beer on draft and offer trivia nights. Dogs are welcome on the deck!"}
{"text":"Went here because I had a groupon.  Disappointing.   Sat at the bar and the waitress was nice but they were out of several items on the menu.   Then our food took far too long for simple dishes.   Bathroom stall out of order, no hand towels.  Maybe needs new management?   I won't go back even with a groupon discount."}
{"text":"Love following this place on Instagram!  The food is just as great as it looks and the beer selections are pretty amazing.  The staff was super friendly and I look forward to going back when I am back in NoDa."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment on the recommendation of a friend.  The restaurant was very clean and the waitstaff was very attentive to our needs.  They seem to have a very good beer selection, even though I only drank two of the new Micro-brew in Charlotte.  Additionally, I would like to give the new micro-brew in Charlotte 6 stars out of 5, but the name escapes me.  Anyways, my date and I each had an entree and two beers each.  I was very pleasantly surprised to have spent under $30, after tip.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new that wants a good value."}
{"text":"Why put it on the menu, if you don't have it? Amateur hour over here! Trying too hard to be \"hip\" but not keeping up on your orders. Tisk tisk."}
{"text":"I know, I  know, I should be basing this review on the beer selection and yadda, yadda, yadda but the past few times i have been here all ive been able to afford are pabst tall boys to drink. So, instead I will base this review on the Carolina Cyclops Pizza which blew my mind. Its a white pie with ham, pancetta, peppers, provolone, cheddar with a cracked egg in the middle. My biffle introduced me to this pizza and now I cant possibly order anything else from the menu. Prior to eating the cyclops I had been to Revolution a few times and had been unimpressed with the food, this pie has redeemed them though. Service is usually pretty good as well and the beer selection does look pretty dope."}
{"text":"Awesome beers on tap - solid food & menu.

What's their unique factor? 
*They offer 1/2 pint pours of many of their beers.
*Really crispy crusts & breads."}
{"text":"Good beer - a lot of local and crafts on tap with plenty of bottles too.  Good service with a nice atmosphere.  Where they fall a little short though is the food.  Don't get me wrong, it is not bad, it just could be a whole lot better.  The breading on the calamari had too much of a spice to it and it almost tastes like fried chicken.  The pizza was just waaaaaay too thin despite tasting ok.  It was very close to paper thin, so a 16\" pie cut into 8 slices for 4 people didn't go too far.  I'd go back to Revolution more for the beer than for the food."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone downhill. We first ate in a couple of times and had good food and decent service. However, our takeout experiences with pizza, have been nightmares.  My 4 1/2 month old daughter can out a pizza together and cut it better than these stoners. \"Printer is always down\" which is why it takes another 25 mins to make my pizza once I get there to pick it up. I've had a manager personally drive pizza to my house because they've screwed it up so bad and I have unlimited free garlic knots cards to give away if anyone needs them. Too bad it's such a cluster, they could be a cool place. I've just bout given up on them."}
{"text":"Amended review, I should have calmed down before I wrote and published the first one.

Food is ok,  great beer selection. management needs a lesson in customer service though.     If I call in an order using the menu I find online and when I get there it is double what I thought it was going to be based on the numbers I saw online,    Do you freaking think there is a problem there?????

The managements excuse?   \"Thats an old menu, our online prices are subject to change.  We are not Revolution Pizza anymore, we are Revolution Ale House\"

Imo I just think the old menu online should not be online anymore to avoid any and all confusion.  Seems like that could be an easy fix.

Oh yeah, and no he did not offer to give me a discount on the food based on the companies complete error in advertising.      

So even though the food is so so, and I do love the marinara, and even though the beer selection is fantastic, since the managements idea of keeping the customer happy is so pathetically twisted,  I wont be going back.

Visit was on July 30th 4pm.

update-   I went back. 8pm on weds  I had to use my living social coupon before it expired.   Calamari was the same as I remembered,   freaking awesome.  I personally prefer the breading here than at Crazy Fish, but a good bud of mine will say I dont know what I am talking about.     Crazy Fish breading is southern in nature but Revolution adds a bit more black pepper to theirs which to me makes it all the more better.      

I still stand by my opinion that something needs to be done about the discrepancy on the web, or management should be more apt to making things right when the mistake is pointed out.   

I am the first to admit my shortcomings and this time around I flew off the handle and bitched and cussed and should not have.   Instead I should have chilled and waited a bit before I shot off a review.

That is all,   back to your normally scheduled programming."}
{"text":"I just came in with a friend for dinner. We sat at the bar. We were told that they don't serve full menu at the  bar. We could start a tab and then transfer it to a table when it was  ready. We didn't want to sit at the bar and and then move to a table to enjoy a meal. It's not like they are not serving food at the bar. Totally rediculous! Bad form managers, bad form."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday with my mother in law. We opted to sit outside as it was a gorgeous day. It was nice on the porch because they have fans and it was covered so even though it was hot it wasn't unbearable. There were a lot of folks there with their dogs so if you aren't into animals you might wanna sit inside. 
They have a huge beer selection which was awesome, we each had a beer and then opted to order two appetizers. We ordered the toasted ravioli and then also the calamari. Both were delicious but the toasted ravioli was my favorite of the two. The dipping sauce for both was the same and it was good, not an overwhelming taste like some marinaras can be. I can't wait to go back and sample their pizza."}
{"text":"Still one of my all-time favorite places to go for pizza, wings, and of course, BEER!  A few things to note, however.  Chef Meredith is no longer reigning in the kitchen, she has moved on to a better opportunity.  The food at Revo's is still great, however.  I have no noticed any quality change.  Also, they are updating their bar area and adding more taps and a lot more TVs.  I can't wait to see the finished product!

The staff is awesome, some of the best people working in restaurants are working here.  Stop by and see them, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Revolution Pizza serves consistently good pizza with a large number of beers on tap.  

Pizzas come in 2 sizes - small and large.  The small is good for one person.  The large is fine for 2 - 3 people.  The crust is quite thin, so while we may be full, my partner and I can polish off the whole thing at one sitting.    I think the mixed mushrooms and roasted garlic toppings are superb together.  

We like to split the large greek salad as an appetizer.  The caprese salad can be good - but only order this during tomato season.

Wednesday night is trivia night.  It starts at 7:30 p.m.  It can be fun, but I think a number of other places do trivia alot better.  I wouldn't recommend going just for the trivia, but if you're in the area and want a few brews and a pizza on a Wednesday, the trivia is a nice bonus.

The venue is awesome - an old mansion on the main corner in NoDa.  There's a great front porch where you can dine with your dog(s)."}
{"text":"I love Revolution, for the pizza, beer and gelato.  Anytime we've sort of strayed from that its been less than stellar results.  But honestly when I want my non NY pizza fix I always want to go here.  My sister and I always get the same thing when we go but I've tried lots of combinations.  Small red pie, button mushrooms, carmelized onion, arugala and sometimes a meat.  Sooo good but no parsley, blech!!

I just love how the crust is crisp yet a bit doughy, the ingredients are really fresh and no they are not loaded on the pizza, but seriously it would get so heavy and they'd all be falling off anyway if that was the case.

Actually my only beef with this place is I always seem to want it on a Monday and that's the one day its closed!!  Oh and they stopped delivering, that was great when they did that."}
{"text":"My buddy came in town and we decided to roll on in here on Thursday night. They started a new game night and we ordered individual pizzas and drank beer and played Bingo. 

We one three free beers and $5 off our tab. We spent about 4 hours her socializing with other bar patrons (the entire Roller Derby Girlz team was here tonight - they were awesome) Going to see one of their bouts this year! 

Anyway - I ordered a personal pepperoni and mushroom pizza - very tasty and loved the crust. My friend got the 'burger\" pizza - it was ok - I would not order it again - I will stick to the classic pizza flavors. 

The beer selection was great and we killed the keg of Four Friends Uptown Brown! 

I will go back this Thursday!!"}
{"text":"Revolution Pizza is located in a nice, older brick building with an awesome outdoor patio in NoDa. I prefer to go during the summer when you can sit outside. 

There is a decent selection of local and craft beers and a good selection of different pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, etc. 

I have been a couple of times before events in the area, and the food has been good on all visits. Prices are a bit on the high side for what you get, but still fair considering the location. 

Overall a good, solid choice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Really good pizza made in wood fired ovens.  Great flavor profiles on the pizzas.  Sides salads and apps were average.  Great selection of beer.  Best aspect of the place is the location on the busiest corner in NODA.  Great place if you're looking for a relaxed environment with great pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered a red pie with mushroom, jalapenos and pepperoni and a garlic sauce. It wasn't bad or outstanding. For some reason the second slice was tastier than the first which didn't make any sense. We thought perhaps the pizza soaked up the garlicness giving more flavor? They should just serve some sort of dipping sauce with their pizza because although the crust had a nice crisp, it was about as plain as the body of Christ you can get from church any Sunday.  

i do like going to Revolution because they do have a pretty good beer selection. Unfortunately, on our last visit they seemed to be in the middle of changing their beer choices so it was hit or miss ordering off the beer menu. i believe on Friday they have $3 NC draught beers.  It'll be interesting to see how they hold up when a beer specific place (Growlers) opens up down the way. 

Also of note, they have a pretty nice outdoor seating area. My only wish would be that the outdoor seating be a little higher so i could easily look over the wall to watch the people on the street without having to use perfect posture sitting straight up. 

We did order gelato on a previous visit and when the wife doesn't seem interested in getting it again, it must not have been too outstanding. The appetizer menu sounded unappetizing to me: mussels, calamari, collards and pork.  i suppose i might like the toasted ravioli and the flat bread, but they didn't sound worth 
7 bucks. 
The service has always been good to us. i imagine we'll be back because there's something i just like about this place (the name, outdoor seating and beer) and at the moment, it is the best place in NoDa for some good brew."}
{"text":"Good food + good beer + good service = good times.

Good Food:

- Demeter pizza - walnut pesto sauce, spinach, red and yellow peppers, tomatoes, feta cheese - I thought this would be good, and it turned out to be even better than I expected.  The sauce, veggies, and perfectly cooked crust melded into a pretty amazing combination.
- Potato and Rosemary pizza - very thinly sliced potatoes, ample rosemary, caramelized onions, and goat cheese - I've never had potatoes on a pizza, but wow was it a good idea!  It works wonders with the rosemary.

Good Beer:

- Beer is separated on the menu into two categories - local North Carolina beer, and all other craft beers.  As we were visiting and are hug proponents of local beers, we were excited to see this as it helped up be able to pick out beers from the area.  

Good Service

- Server was prompt and friendly, and also helped us choose a good local beer.
- Server also acquiesced to our weird request for beer coasters, and went and dug behind the bar and found us four or five different ones to add to our collection.
- Not really service, but definitely part of having a well run restaurant, this place was nicely decorated and very clean.

This was my favorite meal in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Went here tonight, and left very happy! I am somehwat lactose intolerant, and can't really eat alot of pizza. I agreed to meet some friends here, and was at first a little bummed because I thought I wouldn't really be able to find something to eat. menu had alot more than just pizza, and holy crap, alot of beer choices! I had the Lamb Burger, which was awesome! Patty wasn't huge, but very tasty toppings, and I believe some feta or goat cheese sprinkled on top. My friends split two pizzas, and I had a slice of one- Neese's Sausage (are you kidding me!?), caramelized onions, and mushrooms, with the butter parmesan finishing drizzle- OMFG, it was as good as it sounds...
Def will go back. Great food in a great area..."}
{"text":"Revolution is a great spot!  I don't know how it took me so long to try this place out but I sure am glad I did. 

The location is awesome, right on the corner in the middle of NoDa in what looks to be an old house.  If you can sit out on the porch, I recommend it.  You can eat and look out at all of the activity around the neighborhood.  And if that's not enough to keep you entertained, you can color on the paper covered tablecloths with crayons.  Combine that with beer and you've got yourself a good time.  

This place has everything I could possibly desire in terms of local craft beers.  In fact, I don't know that I've seen a place with more local options.  Beers can be ordered in pints, pitchers, or in flights if you want to sample some different things.  

And the 'za is pretty delicious too.  There are tons of options for meat lovers and veggie lovers, and they come in small and large sizes.  The small size covers a normal sized dinner plate and is just enough for one person.  It is cooked nicely with a crispy crust and not too saucy.  I enjoy the Big Kanua which is like a Hawaiian pizza with jalapenos.  There are also some pretty good apps, particularly the curry chicken kabobs.

This is a great place to hang out and have a few beers and some good pizza."}
{"text":"Came here with the girlfriend to use a GroupOn that was about to expire.  Definitely recommend coming for lunch on a Sunday if you don't want to wait - the place was empty (we were the only table for our server).  We ordered The Ogre pizza (avocado, cracked egg, ham, and cilantro, all on a white sauce), as well as two of the spinach side salads and the wings (buffalo and beer battered).  The pizza was quite good - thinner crust with a bit of carbon on the bottom to add flavor, and lots of cheese on top.  Toppings weren't overly numerous but were also not miserly.  Wings were good, and the salads were quite good (apparently a new item on the menu - would recommend).  Server was quite nice and came multiple times to check on us to make sure we were OK.  Would definitely go back, especially on some of the days where they have specials.  Price was a bit high, but luckily the GroupPon helped out with that!"}
{"text":"Revolution Ale House has all the makings of a good place, but it somehow just didn't really hit the mark for me. The wings were pretty good, though I only had the garlic parmesan, and they came as part of a beer and wings deal (half a dozen wings with a beer for $10). The crust was the best crust I've had from a restaurant pizza in a long time. The ingredients seemed like they were pretty fresh, but the combination of the ingredients together--at least in my pizza--didn't deliver as much as I'd hoped. I had the ogre, which came as a recommendation from the waitress. I pretty much would've eaten the crust with the sauce that came with the garlic knots, but everything else was kinda unerseasoned and less-than-satisfying. I probably should've done what another member of our party did and just ordered the wings. 

The service also left much to be desired. I understand that we had a big group (8 people), and there were two more that came way later. The waitress was very, very nice and was cheerful, and we liked her overall. However, it wasn't busy and there were a few things that we had to ask for several times. I don't think I've ever been to a place where I waited 10+ minutes for my beer to come out. We sat there for over 20 minutes before the garlic knots made an appearance. We had to ask for water several times (but she was pretty good about asking if we wanted more beer), and everything else moved a little too slow (not the waitress' fault, I know, but it's counted as part of service). It's an ok place, but with the other offerings available in Charlotte, it's hard to see myself making a point to return."}
{"text":"Summary: great location, good atmosphere, extensive beer selection and below average food.

Both the interior and exterior of Revolution is eye catching.  It sits on a large corner lot in the heart of NoDa.  Be advised that parking is very tight so you'll likely have to search for a street spot.  The staff are laid back and the attire is casual.  A friend and I decided to grab dinner here before the 'stache Yelp bar crawl.  We sat at the bar and unfortunately were not greeted or even acknowledged for nearly 10 minutes.  Once we got the attention of a bartender, he was very nice and seemed to just be juggling multiple tasks.  

We ordered the margarita pizza and a Caesar salad with shrimp.  The margarita pizza was barely edible.  The crust was less than cracker thin, the toppings were very sparse (tomatoes and mozzarella) and there was just a drizzle of balsamic.  It was very bland.  The Caesar salad tasted like something I could have made at home and it was under-dressed.  

Overall, I'd not return for dinner but I'd definitely stop in for a few beers.  Plus, they had $3 well drinks on a Saturday which is a generous deal for a weekend night!"}
{"text":"This visit will constitute my last visit as well. I went to Revolution Pizza and Ale House, which should've been a great experience, however there are some things that really prejudice their ultimate goal. First and foremost, we had to wait 30 minutes in order to be seated in seating that we did not ask for. We asked for patio seating, not a seat in the middle of the gangway. The servers looked overly rushed, yet everytime they came from the Back of House, they had  next to nothing in their hands. We had to wait an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes in order to get 2 pizzas, a salad and a sandwich to go. I had to personally go up to one of the servers and ask them what are they doing, as it was 9:30 and they were about to close. Our food came out at 9:45. This was after waiting from 7:45 to 8:15 for seating. That is absolutely ridiculous for any place. I've been to comparable places in NoDa, where we were seated and fed expeditiously, whereas we had to wait 2 hours, just to eat food swimming in oil. My stomach did not agree with them, and the way they operated when I went into Revolution Pizza was about as stellar as going to McDonalds during rush hour. If the servers put more effort in their customers and pull their britches up, I wouldn't have had to eat an inedible $12 pizza and reap consequences unforseen. 
Never again."}
{"text":"I really love the pizza at Revolution. Both times I've been, it's been delicious. The service is slower than I would like, but the  pizza and beer options make it worth it. Looking toward to going back in warmer months and sitting outside."}
{"text":"What up BEN!!!
Hey Revolution Rocks!  I have my own bartender now and couldn't be happier; the owners are great as well.
They always seem to have great specials on.  It was a slow start for them in NODA, but they seem to be pretty packed each time I dine/drink there now.  I think they may be closed on Monday's, check into that.
Great brand new TV's so I love catchin' a big game there as well.
Its possible you may have to drive around for parking, but I've always had good luck with that!
Try the caramelized onions and BBQ chicken-sweet!
Italian sausage and cheese is great too; I haven't had a bad pizza yet; and I'm not easy to please being from Chicago!"}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant. Their pizzas are fresh with lots of toppings to choose from including house made and gourmet toppings. they also have a good beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time since moving to noda in January.  It was lunch time, but there were only about 3 two tops seated total. Being a server myself, I know even just a few tables can be busy when you're alone on the floor. (it seemed there was 1 server for lunch today) The restaurant was clean (although we opted to sit on the patio). Our server seemed very disinterested in being there or taking our order. I asked for the calamari first as an appetizer (when he finally came back to the table).  My fiancé and I both ordered sandwiches as our main meals. It took roughly 20 to 25 minutes to get the food out, which would have been fine had the calamari not arrived along with our sandwiches. The whole reason I'd ordered an appetizer was because I was hungry and knew it wouldn't take long to cook the calamari. But, no, all came at once. The calamari was very soggy (greasy), as if it hadn't been drained after frying or hadn't been cooked long enough,  and it came with a pomodoro sauce that was runny and looked so very watered down . The chips that came with the sandwiches were cold and stuck together. The corned beef panini I had was pretty tasty. The server appeared one more time to ask if a box was needed and run the check. Very disappointed in the experience. Poor service,  greasy food, no known lunch or drink specials."}
{"text":"Fantastic tap beer selection. Anywhere that carries Foothills is a winner in my book. Bottle beer selection is pretty outstanding too. Just had their Xmas in July flight...6 oz. pours of 4 different Xmas beers. Yum! The lamb burger is great...pizzas are good when you build your own. This place is all about the beer and outdoor seating/cornhole. Great location in eclectic little NODA."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing servers and amazing atmosphere.  Two thumbs all caught every day"}
{"text":"I visited Revolution on a Monday night (1-13-14, to be exact) with my friend and her father. I chose this place because it was the remaining restaurant that I had yet to try in NoDa and I was in the mood for pizza. As you would expect for a Monday evening, the restaurant was pretty sparse.

I ordered the Margherita pizza, my friend ordered the Guacamole pizza, and her dad ordered the veggie calzone. The pizzas we ordered were made with a very thin crust (not a personal favorite) but the flavors of the margherita pizza were great especially thanks to the balsamic reduction added to it! The only thing is, halfway throughout my eating, my pizza got cold. I think it was a combination of the cool air inside and the thin crust.

I had a taste of the veggie calzone and consider it something that I'll order on my next go-round.

With it being pretty empty, I found the service to be quite slow. Our waitress was perfectly nice but the time between ordering & receiving our meals was kind of ridiculous.

All in all, it's a decent spot for specialty pizza. I also hope to try out their beer specials for my next trip."}
{"text":"This was our first time to visit Revolution Pizza.  After being seated on the front sunroom, it was just too cold to remain comfortable, not to mention that although there were several booths and only one family out there, they sat us directly behind that family!  The boy was loud and noise reverberated.  So we moved inside where it was toasty and although a little noisy, it was more alive!

The menu was much more expansive than on their website!  We ordered a veggie pizza that actually was vegan with no cheese.  So glad our waiter was kind enough to point that out and offer to add cheese!!  (What pizza has no cheese?)  It was delicious!  The crust was thin and crispy with bubbly edges!  All fresh ingredients - wow, it was awesome!  

My husband enjoyed the massive beer selections, although he didn't love all the beers he got for his flight.  I was disappointed in the fact that the wine I ordered was $9 on the menu, yet we were charged $11.  Just didn't feel like dealing with it so we didn't say anything.

Revolution is across town from where we live.  Would we drive there for pizza all the time?  No.  But if we were craving a good pizza and beer one night, we sure would to make an evening of it!  There certainly is no pizza joint like that in Southpark!!!"}

{"text":"My wife and I visited Revolution Ale House one night and had their \"Revolution\" pie. One of the best pizza's I've ever had. My wife loved the pizza so much that I decided to have her birthday party there. The folks at Revolution were easy to work with and delivered in a big way. Our servers were great and there was plenty of room for the 30 people invited to the party. It was a great venue coupled with great service and friendly people."}
{"text":"We were excited to have our first experience in NoDa - Brought the In-Laws from California - And were excited to try some of the multitude of beer options at Revolution and see the style of NoDa. But honestly and I work in the service industry, so I hate giving poor reviews, but we were underwhelmed.  We went in through the front doors and were just completely overtaken by a stench in the place - Combination burnt pizza and spilled beer. I mean I guess if you know what you're expecting, take this with a grain of salt - But really it just turned us off to ordering any food, and we sat outside.  We ordered a couple flights and a pitcher - And those were fantastic, beer was good server was nice. But after just walking into the place we didn't even want to try the food - It looked dirty and smelled worse."}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks with a friend. Selection of beers was good and the price was pretty average. Atmosphere was so-so. The bar is relatively small and nothing special in general."}
{"text":"I signed up for a yelp account just for this restaurant...If you are looking for fast, friendly, quality service you have come to the wrong place.  I have given this place try after try but consistently find myself disappointed when I walk out the door.  If you are looking for a beer selection they have a decent one, but nothing else deserves your attention.  Pizza is the LAST thing you should desire when entering Revolution.  Two stars base solely on the beers on tap.  I believe most of the high marks for this place involve a night of alcohol and a fuzzy remembrance of how bad it actually was!"}
{"text":"We had some friends come into town so we decided to show them what the QC had to offer.  After a day of shuttling around Charlotte, we stopped in to NoDa, and this neat place.
Since there was a considerable wait, we decided to start off with some beverages.  The selection on tap is great, ranging from local brews on out.  Although crowded, we found room at one of several stand-up tables in the front bar area.  When seated, we reviewed the menu, and boy! did that cause some problems!
Everything looked awesome.  We decided to try several things, and just go family-style.  The pizza was good, but not \"holy mackerel\".  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The crust was thin, but not too flavorful.  Sometimes this is good, especially if you're more interested on your toppings.  Me?  I'm a carb fan, and as such demand a lot from my doughs!  What really blew me away was the lamburger!  One bite and I was in heaven!  The divinity of this burger was nothing short of a spiritual awakening, both in my mouth and in my belly!  A juicy, well-seasoned hunk of ground lamb lightly dressed with fresh, homemade cucumber yogurt sauce (aka tzatziki or masto khiar) sitting on top of a ciabatta bun made this dish deelish!  Everyone at the table agreed that this was, by far, the best on the table.
We finished off with some homemade gelato.  Smooth, light, and refreshing after a hard day's traveling!  
Overall, a great time was had by all.  The service was friendly, although due to the heavy traffic, we didn't have too much time to interact.  The location is awesome, and our seating was probably the best in the house with views of the eclectic NoDa area!  The story of the building itself is really neat too.
Noosh!"}
{"text":"Worst cold Italian sandwich ever. 3 pieces of thin meat with a thick, cold bun. Waste of $8. Good ranch dressing though."}
{"text":"I want so much more from this place! The location is awesome and its a pretty neat, comfortable layout with a great bar - excellent beer selections - but the food just doesn't match it. I don't know if they're trying to do too much at once or what. They have tons of topping selections for pizzas but not a lot of specialty pizzas featured. Everything I've had here is just 'meh.' I heard they are going to have a new manager or something along those lines soon and I hope they'll make some major improvements, because this joint has major potential!"}
{"text":"Rev is a solid place for good za, and a great beer selection.

I have been here MANY times, sometimes after work at the bar alone with a Red Oak and a personal pizza, other times on the weekend on the patio with a bunch of friends. 
Usually good service, sometimes it can be a bit slow, especially on drink re-fills and such. 
Pizza is always good, build your own with some unique things you don't find at most pizza joints. I always get the fresh mozz, and basil makes a huge difference, in addition to whatever protein I decide to go with on the pie. Careful, those little toppings add up quick and could make for a pricey pizza. 

A great go-to spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have been back and forth on whether or not to love Revolution. Usually, I am there when they are about to close and the staff is unenthusiastic and the food is just ok. However, when I tried it earlier in the evening, it was pretty fantastic. The crust was chewy with just enough crunch to the edges. The toppings tasted fresh and there was plenty of cheese on the slices as well. The only hiccup was when I ordered a sour peach beer that they had just gotten in, it was warm. They good naturedly traded it in for a cold red ale instead. Overall, I was happy with my experience and would return."}
{"text":"We met friends here before a gallery crawl a few weeks ago.  We sat on the patio as it was a very pleasant evening.  Service started off just fine.  Then began to dwindle.  It could have been the fact that they were out of many of the beers we had picked, and the server was having to run back and forth.  Had calamari as an app, lots of crust and fried bits, no actual calamari.  Entrees arrived about an hour later, except for my fiancee's, that came 10 minutes after ours.  No apology included.  Pizza was OK.  Wings were too salty and too spicy.  Caprese salad was pretty good.  Highlight of the meal was dessert.  Creme brulee and blueberry gelato were excellent.  So the moral of the story is come for dessert, maybe a beer if they have the one you want."}
{"text":"Finally made it back for a meal at this establishment. Service was a tad slow, there was only one waitress for the entire patio area, but atmosphere was laid back (they let dogs chill on the patio too). Good location, plenty of parking along side streets, lots of outdoor seating. Pizza was solid. Went with a red pie with spinach, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers. Super thin crust, love it! The mint sweet tea just tasted like regular ol' sweet tea, no minty-ness at all. But besides that, I enjoyed my Revolution experience.

Also, Tuesdays special: $1 half pints! Great way to taste a ton of different beers."}
{"text":"The bartenders are very knowledgable about  their beer and provide really helpful tips. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are Miller Lite (or similar)- cost is the same as their craft beers.  Their pizza dough is great, toppings are fresh, wide selection. Only thing is, I'm a sauce person. I like a lot of red sauce on my pizza. They are not heavy with their sauce. Random- their homemade potato chips are great. Also, consider stopping by for trivia Wednesday nights- low tech, but fun."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time.  Not their best effort but i could see why this place is so popular. They had just opened when i arrived so I believe they were still getting situated causing some slower than usual (I suspect) service. Located on an ideal corner in NODA. Great beers on tap plus they change them often so there is always something new to try.  Nice outdoor seating with plenty of space.  Had a pancetta, mozz, tomato and balsamic reduction sandwich on ciabatta bread- very good."}
{"text":"Met some friends for lunch and it was quite empty. We grabbed seats at the bar and the bartender was very friendly letting us sample beers. One of my \"new years resolutions\" is to try as much NC beer as possible, Revolution will make that easy. The majority of the draft beers are from NC. We ordered the New York Calzone, which does not come in Large but they made it anyways. It was not the best pizza I've had, there was an absence of sauce. The sausage was the star, it tasted like neeses! Overall: awesome place to grab local brews and split a pie amongst friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I went there during the food tour with Feast Food Tours. We went in the kitchen and watched Corey cook a pizza (that we later sampled). As the pizza cooked, we sampled beer at the bar. The pizza was amazing! We ate the Noda special. The toppings weren't my usual selection, but the combination was AMAZING! Pulled pork, sweet peppers, carmelized onions with a balsamic drizzle - all the components of good barbeque, but on a pizza. If I lived in Charlotte, I would order this pizza every week. I definitely recommend you try Revolution Ale House & their Noda special. Better yet, take a Feast Food tour and sample from different Noda restaurants. It's worth the money."}
{"text":"My first experience, not a good one. When our party of 6 arrived-we were greeted by a fretting hostess (and an empty restaurant except for about 6 folks). She told us they didn't have ANY tables because there was a private party coming in to the private room... so we asked about the bar. Of course we could sit there-but the bartender was stuck in the elevator (???) and their servers were with the private party (which she informed us hadn't arrived and wouldn't for a bit). We sat down with high hopes, having heard great things about the place... and were salivating over the menu for 10 minutes before we gave up and left.

I'll try again another time..."}
{"text":"Gelato- 5*, Pizza 4*.   I was very skeptical to see another Pizza shop in this prime NODA spot, so much that I didn't try it for a while.  Then a foodie friend said he loved it, so we gave it a try.   Such good pizza, gourmet style, great ingredients and fun combinations.  I also am a huge fan of the spinach salad with roasted eggplant, also something I only tried out of suggestion.   Solid place!  Miss it, but not as much as the friends we used to go with of course. :)"}
{"text":"I'm moving to Charlotte soon, and I came here with my wife when I was in town for job interviews. We were promptly seated, and our server was really friendly. There's a great selection of beers on tap, and I was happy to see that Bell's Two Hearted Ale was available. We ordered some garlic knots, and they were great. Our pizza was excellent. 

We'll be back for sure once we move."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection and tasty pizza.  I like their thin crust pizza as a change-up from the New York style.  The dough has a nice chew and a different texture than what I am used to.  They have a spacious inside and also patio seating and trivia night outside.  I didn't notice until after the fact, but if you eat outside on a nice day, there is a good chance a dog will be staring you in the face.  Some people don't mind but my wife and I do."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Awesome beer selection. Worst  service I've had in years!  I think our waiter (Gabe) was so busy flirting with another waitress that he forgot he's at work. No water refills, wanted to order another beer but he never came by, salad was late, no dressing, never checked back in. Would have left no tip but I waited tables in college so we left 10%. It was generous!"}
{"text":"If you havent been to this Pizza place in Noda, you have missed the Gondola!   Great big place, upstairs, 44 kinds.of Draft beers. and the most Amazing Pizza! ...Thinner Crust, we.ordered a Large Carolina Cyclops. It was a white pizza. with Cheddar and Mozz, Roasted Red Peppers, Pancetta, and three Cracked Eggs!   Piping Hot and so delicious!Lots of Apps and Salads, Some sandwiches too...but the Pizza is the best I have had in a long time..and I am from Chicago..so I know a little bit about Za! 5 stars, cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Man, I'm glad I haven't reviewed this place yet.  Now that they have re-energized the place with the new bar and the menu switch up, I am a huge fan.

Interior is nice and cozy and the patio or the bar is an instant hit for me.  I love the wide bar, plenty of elbow room.

The food is equally great and of course like the older Revolution the beer selection is great and plentiful."}
{"text":"Seriously y'all... let me put it out there like this:  white pie with fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, and truffle oil.  BOOM!  Wash it down with a pitcher of your favorite IPA and that's how dinner gets done.  Now if they could just build a parking deck behind their building, you could find me here weekly.  

The previous reviews had me a little wary- sometimes cold pizza, uninspiring appetizers, you get the gist.  Well I am happy to report that my experience was nothing but sunshine and smiles, save for crazy weekend parking in NoDa.  

The wife and I brought in an out of town couple for a night of pizza and beers.  We had about a 20 minute wait at the bar, which was crowded but not too bad for a Saturday night.  That gave us just enough time to order a pitcher of draft beer from their ENORMOUS tap list.  Some things were out (Boo...) but with such a big selection it was a little hard to be too disappointed.  Do buy a pitcher when you can, better value for the money compared to single drafts, especially the way they use little symbols on the menu to help you figure out the price.

Once seated, our server was quick and unassuming, making sure to keep the pitcher refilled and in both taking and delivering our order.  The menu had plenty of specialty pizzas along with the make your own, which is how the culinary masterpiece I mentioned above came into being.  We also ordered their version of the cheeseburger pizza and (while I thought Wolfman's version could not be topped) it was very good- the mustard sauce was a nice but unexpected surprise.  Both pies had a great crust that was not too thin or thick, with a nice mix of outer crunch and inner chew.  

We also shared a cup of gelato for dessert and it was nothing short of the perfect end to an otherwise heavy meal.  All their gelato is house-made.  

Now we also shared the peanut butter nutella pie, which was out of this world.  I'm still partial to the heaping mound of Nutella Pie you get from Mama Ricotta's, but this pie at Revolution has little to be ashamed of.  It's just gosh darn good.  

Revolution ranks up there in terms of best pizza in town for me.  When it's time to add a beer to the mix, Revolution will be my new go-to."}
{"text":"I don't understand how I have eaten here more than once.  I hate to be cruel but with so many other fantastic finds in NoDa (Jack Beagles and Cabo Fish Taco being my faves), I don't know why my friends have forced me to eat here.  I am Italian and very picky about my pizza.  It's nothing short of Digornio, in my opinion. I have tried other things, but due to their lack of impression I cannot tell you what they were.  Again, maybe I'm just being a pizza snob but its nothing anyone is missing.  But since its the only pizza joint in NoDa, they don't have a lot of options. Poor NoDites. :("}
{"text":"In my pursuit to patronize local charlotte business and include my gluten free wife, we decided to visit the revolution ale house. 
  Let me begin with the gluten free pizza because it's worth the mention. My wife said  and I quote \"I feel normal\". That's a great compliment if you have been eating gluten free for any amount of time. My wife had a Hawaiian style pizza that she had built. I tasted it and the crust cracked as I bit into it. It was very good for GF. We definitely recommend.
  I had the El Chupacabra. It was an excellently crafted pizza. Unique ingredients and a lovely taste.
  The waiter that took care of us deserves a shout out. \"Ben\" was very knowledgeable in all areas. Excellent service. 
  Revolution is a very cool spot, located in a very cool place. Stop by for one of their 44 beers on draft. Thursday's is $3 pints. Well worth the visit. Thanks !"}
{"text":"We have been to this place several times and it never disappoints us! I love the freshly made pizza dough & hand picked ingredients! The authentic food is why we keep returning and not to mention the homemade ranch dressing is the best!!!

They also serve locally brewed beer, but you can also order other types of beer & drinks they have a full bar! The atmosphere is great laid back with outdoor sitting! The staff is really nice along with great service!!

I recommend if you come to NoDa check out this spot - you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Gone WAY DOWNHILL from where they used to stand! I've loved this place for years now - but the past three times I have gone I have had less than satisfying experiences  and errors- and after today's experience for my girlfriend's birthday - it was the last time I will ever give them my business:
1. We called to confirm earlier in the week that they had 1/2 off bottles of wine on Sunday, were told they did and made plans thus, and then this offer was not available today. 
2. The \"Dirty Martini's\" that were made for my girlfriends were horrible - the bar tender offered to exchange them for equal priced whisky shots then charged us 3 times as much for each one.
3. We had to order our drinks two - maybe three times - with reminders to get them to the table finally.
4. Our appetizer never arrived - despite two or three requests about it.
5. Our first large pizza came out as a small.
6. Our second large pizza came out and the first pizza we ordered was knocked to the floor.
7. When we asked for our check we found that several of the items we had been told would be \"comped\" due to errors were actually on our ticket - including the appetizer we never received. The waiter seemed unable to resolve this due to a \"computer system error\".
8. Slow service - all in all - and the manager never came out to speak to us - he left it entirely in the hands of the waiter - who while he appeared to be doing his best with nothing - was unable to take care of us in the way a professional business should. 
Only giving this place 2 stars over 1 star because the pizza is very good - but the errors and management has made it where I must refuse on grounds of honor to ever return. Sad indeed - back in 2010 I would have given Revolution 5 stars but today it's lucky to get 2 from me."}
{"text":"Came in Friday with a friend to use my Living Social Deal. So glad I did. Service was great....also too great as everything came very quick and we were in no rush. Our waitress however did not make us feel rushed at all and we were able to enojy our yummi beers. I wish they carried a tap or two of Triple C. I know they have in the past,....I just wish they did always. :) We got the NODA pizza and it was amazing! I would never think to put balsamic vin on my pizza but it was spot on. I already loved this spot and am sure I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Good craft beer selection, good food.

I hear the pizza is good, we had the calzones & they were alright. They poured garlic butter over them, had to dab that off, but then they were still a little mushy. I'll try slices next time. The carrot cake martini was delicious!"}
{"text":"The biggest positive about this place is their tap list.  It's impressive and there is a lot of opportunity to try beers that you haven't had before or some that you don't see on tap anywhere else.  For me, that's where the positive ends.  The price for a pizza that is nothing special is absolutely ridiculous.  $23 for a 2 topping large (16\") pie will surely be their downfall.  There is better pizza for half the price about a mile and half away, and with Benny's opening soon I don't see this place lasting long after that.  Go for the beer, but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I hate to do this...but after last night, Revolution is on my list, and not my \"this place is so awesome, I want to eat here all the time\" list.  A little history: the first few times I ate at Revolution, I absolutely loved it.  The pizza has always been tasty, hot, and leaves me satisfied.  The beer list has always been impressive.  After ordering take out a few weeks ago, I got it home and it was soggy in the middle.  You better believe I took it back and had a replacement pizza made, which was still soggy, just not as much (I live less than 5 minutes down the road - not like it was in the car or anything for a long period of time).  

Last night, my boyfriend and I decided to swing by for a pizza and unwind with a few beers.  First, the place was pretty busy, which I fully expect on a Friday night.  We were seated right away.  Ordered our beers, and the waitress came back about 5 minutes later saying they were all out of both beers we ordered (AFTER my boyfriend double checked if the list was updated asked if they actually had what we ordered).  BUMMER.  Then we ordered the beer cheese as an appetizer, which comes out in a salad dressing sized cup.  Almost too small for two people to share.  It was just OK...I've had better beer cheese.  We waited more than 30 minutes for our pizza.  While we waited, I saw a roach crawling down the side of the door frame.  EW.  I was completely grossed out and watched it scurry across the floor (I left a note as we were leaving reporting the creepy bug we both saw).  We ordered the NoDa pizza, which is the usual for us.  It was not as tasty as it had been in the past.  The meat was sort of burnt and it lacked flavor this time around.  Sadly, it looks like we'll have to find a new favorite pizza joint, as this is no longer it."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Thursday night is $3.50 local drafts, which is really great. I like that they support local breweries and make craft beers affordable. The chicken, bacon, ranch pizza is my favorite and the beer cheese is legit. The place itself is very roomy and cool. Staff is nice. Worth a try."}
{"text":"So happy to find a place in daHood!  
Mind you they were crazy busy bc of the gallerycrawl, but the pizza was right on.
Appetizer  -   Fried Ravioli  a la St Louis and they were as expected when you fry anything - great.  
Had two pizzas, we the veggie route bc of friends, both were great, but one was fantastic.
Great - Spinach, Onions, Roasted Garlic, & Mozzarella  -  Good, could've had more of everything, seemed to skimp a bit, but still a nice pie
Fantastic - White Pizza with olives, sauteed mushrooms, and a spicy olive oil drizzle at the end.

Management seemed very active in watching both front and back of house, the wait staff was fairly good, but some of the bussers seemed to disappear when I spilled a beer and we had to clean up ourselves.  Literally 3 of them saw it and not one approached to help.

Prices were okay a bit much to tack on a $1 plus to drizzle olive oil on a pizza."}
{"text":"Many beers on tap, plus the special, O yeah the pizza is on point. 

Monday : 4 dollar charlotte beers
Tuesday : 4 dollar NC  beers 
Wednesday : 4 dollar select drafts
Thrusday : 3 dollars all drafts 
Friday : 4 dollar brew of the month 
Saturday : 3 and 4 dollar craft cans 
Sunday 4 dollar mimosa"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, although the 'large' pizzas are pricey they are good.  I had the Ogre pizza recently, cilantro - prosciutto -avocado - mozzarella  and egg, wonderful pizza  I don't understand why they cut the pizza with odd number of slices- we had to fight over the last slice.The crust was wonderfully light and airy but it was very salty and needed some kind of heat spice added to it to balance the salt.
They should take into consideration that not everyone can handle salt like that, although it probably came from the meat it needed to be leveled off."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill recently which is so disappointing.  When they're on, their pizza is so good, but unfortunately we've had multiple bad experiences here with quality and service.  It seems like there's always a rumor that they're shutting down, but maybe it's because the service is so terrible."}
{"text":"The pizza is SO good! And my man loves the calzones. The staff is always on point and it's our favorite place for food in Noda. Try the lamb burger, too. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I went there for a friends birthday. We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night and of course the bar and restaurant was packed. We were told the wait would be 20 - 30 mins which it was or slightly longer. 

The bar has several TVs and the area of the restaurant we were seated in had one which was nice since there were several games on that night. They have a variety of beer. I ordered a round of car bombs for the group and was told they didn't have Guinness but would use a different stout. (No problem) When we got the bar bombs they used Baileys and vodka instead of Baileys and Jameson or another Irish whiskey.  (Not cool)

I had the fried calamari which was very good and the Falfa sandwich which was extremely good. The service was great and overall we all had a great time."}
{"text":"Every time I have visited this pizza house, I've honestly had great experiences, the wait staff are very friendly and always willing to offer suggestions for ya if you're in  an indecisive mood!  (we've all been there... it's ok)   I ordered the falafel sammich!  YUM-EEE!  This particular time the cocktails were ordered.  They had a few beers on special and I opted for one of them.... It was not pleasing to my palate and when I asked for a different one the waiter took it without any hesitation and suggested one for me, which was by far superior to the previous one.  Even though I wasn't expecting it, he removed it from the tab!  I'm sold!  
Definitely a great atmosphere and a party on a friday night!  I highly recommend it for those looking for a chill pizza night out!"}
{"text":"Good food! Had a slice of pizza and their homemade Chips! Both good bar food and they have a huge draft list which is a bonus! Only thing service is a bit slow -- don't come if your in a hurry. Food takes forever to come out & you get forgotten about from your server. Would come back for drinks only"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place without having tried the pizza seeing I don't eat cheese.

This place is nice: good brews, nice atmosphere, and awesome staff. Aside from sandwiches, they have an array of \"sides\", appetizers, sandwiches and salads. I had their homemade potato chips with dill dip and they were so addicting I had to put the basket away from me so I wouldn't eat them all. 

If you're in NoDa and in need for foodstuffs, I'd definitely recommend here."}
{"text":"Tonight I had one of the strangest/most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had...period. I came here for happy hour with a group of 7 other people to celebrate a friend's birthday. Almost every time someone ordered, they had to pick a different drink or food item on the menu because the restaurant was out of a key ingredient. 

I started keeping a list. Here's what Revolution was out of tonight (a Thursday evening, mind you, commonly known as THIRSTY Thursday where people enjoy alcohol and apps): 

Out of:
Beer cheese dip 
Moscato
Angry orchard cider
Fireball
Jamison
Bailey's
Ginger beer (for a Moscow mule)
Wrap (for the Falafel Wrap)

I'm not kidding, people. It was CRAZY. After the 8th (count them, 8) \"sorry we're out of this, you'll have to pick something else,\" I asked the waiter what the heck is going on. Like, are we missing something here? He said a manager recently quit and he wasn't sure what's happening with the lack of food/drinks, but also expressed frustration. I feel ya, dude - I'm sure it's not fun to constantly tell your eager, hungry patrons that the food/drink they'd like to order can't happen. 

I will commend our waiter for keeping a pleasant demeanor with our bewildered group. The place seems to have great potential and an awesome front porch that I'm sure is great when it's warmer out... Still, I doubt I'll be back. Hopefully new management is hired soon to help get this place back on track."}
{"text":"Use to love Rev, at there a few times a month. Many times in recent history they do not have ingredients or wait staff when we go in. On one occasion we literally sat outside on a Saturday morning from 12:00-12:30 while we saw people inside, but the doors were locked. They have lost some solid customers. Hate to see this happen in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible! My husband and I sat at the bar last night and the bartender walked by us 4 different times with her head turned, deliberately avoiding eye contact with us. She was more concerned with getting her bar tickets done then helping her bar guests. And we weren't the only ones with this issue, several people around us were trying to get her attention. I ended up leaving without dinner because she was just too busy to get our order. It was absolutely ridiculous. The only time I will EVER order from there again is if we do take out. Not a way to run a business at all."}
{"text":"Good food and our waitress was attentive and friendly But the temperature was 85 degrees not exagerating  it was hot no air and that is why it was empty and I was told by a customer it is always  like this  until the owner  spends a dime  and turns the sir conditioning  do not go"}
{"text":"We love revolution pizza. Why? Because of the beer menu. This is probably the best location in Charlotte to find pitchers of good beer. 

The pizza is not special and the calamari was really disappointing.

Go for the beer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visit to Revolution.

We sat outside & Ben took excellent care of us!

Fried ravioli, Small extra cheese, sausage & carmelized onions pie - pizzaria-style!  Pastrami Reuben with fresh chips!

Reasonable pricing, great value!  Served fresh & hot!

1/2 price bottles of wine in Sunday!  They need to stock up on prosecco!

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried to be a fan of this place but it is really hard...

On the plus side, it's got great outdoor seating and I can easily walk there from where I live.

On the negatives:

*The toppings are really expensive - like Artichoke Hearts - and I find like 5 pieces on a large pizza. I am always finding ground up pits in the Kalamata Olives, onion skins in the onions, and unchewable bits of carmelized garlic.

*The service is ridiculously slow. I tried to go last night with a friend, there were a ton of empty tables and the hostess told us \"They were understaffed...\" so we couldn't be seated for 20 minutes. And even after 20 minutes, I still see the hostess rushing around but not actually seating us. We went somewhere else.

*I ordered for takeout on the weekend once - when I got there, they told me that my pie had been burnt (which is food service code for \"We didn't make it yet\") and they rushed to make another one. Despite my urging to not rush, the pizza had unmelted globs of cheese and random toppings I didn't even ask for (which, as a vegetarian, finding bits of Sausage in your mouth is pretty gross).

All in all, I've tried really hard to love having a pizza place in the neighborhood, but Revolution just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite spot, they used to have the best fried pickles in Charlotte and their pizza was on point. Probably close to 8 months ago, their pickles went on a serious decline, and they went from giving you a bowl of perfectly fried thick pickles slices, to giving you maybe 10 slices covered in grease, yet the price remained the same. Their pizza also went downhill. If you're going to charge $20+ for a  pizza, then atleast put the cheese and toppings somwhere near the crust. After multiple times of ordering a pizza only to be disappointed with a 4 inch gap of nothing but dough between the crust and where they stopped putting the cheese and toppings we began sending it back, and transitioned to ordering our pizzas with the toppings all of the way to the crust (Which we always received weird looks for requesting, but hey, we know what we want, and we know how lazy the cook has gotten, so we felt it was necessary to remind them of the proper way to put cheese and toppings on). We never went to Revolution for their service, because I'd always say it was more often than not some lazy waiter that was waiting on our table. When its summer time and the patio is open, you don't notice it as much, but if your'e stuck inside and you have to be the one that continuously has to go search for your waiter just so you can get a refill, or a napkin, or even a plate - the frustration can definitely build up.  Eventually though, when you're served nothing but a grease bowl of pickles and your pizza comes out on a dirty pizza pan that looks like they've never once cleaned the oven out from the burnt remnants from the pizzas before you, and your waiter goes MIA in an empty restaurant, you begin to think why are you wasting your Saturday night at a place that doesn't give a crap about their food or their customer service. After our last visit, I can say I will never return to this crap hole - if you want a lazy waiter who is more concerned with either getting high or drunk before ever returning to your table, this is the place to go. My favorite part though, is the last time we were there, our waiter who couldn't get our ticket right and continued to add random beers and appetizers to our bill for 2 people who just had a drink each and a pizza continued to apologize by saying \"he wasn't good at math\" whatever that means? It would have been easier to leave $40 bill on the table than have to deal with him, but unfortunately for him, he didn't deserve even the tip we gave him.

See ya never Revolution, I'll never recommend you again"}
{"text":"Service is at a snail's pace. The fried pickles came out on time but we are waiting for burgers for a long time. The question is where is the food. Thank goodness they have good 70s music that kept me entertained for such a long wait. The pickles were pretty typical for fried pickles nothing to write home about.  And for that enormous long wait time the food came to the table under whelming. The bun was cold. My daughter had the chicken sandwich and didn't finish it. The bacon on the chicken sandwich was raw only the edges were cooked. This place was a total disappointment I will not be spending my money here again. I only wish the food was as good as the music."}
{"text":"I went back to Revolution and decided to try out some of their other options. I had their falafel which was actually really good and full of flavor. It was served with a really lovely butternut squash bisque and was a ton of food for $8.


They had an excellent beer special on Wednesday nights - $3 for any draft. I tried a delicious watermelon wheat and a white zombie wheat beer, both were incredibly refreshing. A+ beer selection (which I'm told changes quite a bit as the menu online was different). 

Our service was top notch, which wasn't easy considering we were a group of 18.  She was very sweet and was able to get us everything we needed promptly.

I'll definitely be back on a Wednesday night for a sandwich and a beer ! Don't forget they also have their own parking lot out back."}
{"text":"The pizza here is awesome.  The crust is chewy and the toppings are fresh.  The grilled pizza is ridiculous also, and the appetizers are solid, but what gets me here every time is the BEER!  They have a pretty extensive rotating tap list and they do a Brewery of the Month (which was Blue Mountain when we went, YUM!)."}
{"text":"This is a two-parter.

The first part sees us stop for a bite on the way to a gallery crawl.

We ordered some mussels as a prelude to some pie.  The mussels were horribly fishy-tasting with little to indicate that they hadn't just come out of the ocean.  Some might say that was fresh, which could be true.  We thought it was nasty.  And a bit rubbery.

The pie we chose was one of the grilled pizzas, because that's a bit off the beaten track.  It had an interesting choice of balsamic vinegar, and quite frankly, I don't recall what else, because there was so much of it on there.  A drizzling would have been nice, but let's cut back, so we can taste something else, okay?

The second part is on our way back from the crawl, when we decided that we wanted dessert.

By then, the place was packed.  That presumably is a good sign, so we bellied up to the dessert bar and ordered some gelato and a cakey-type thing.  The gelato was good, but a bit much.  A small would have been better (this was our fault).  The cake was good, but the flavors didn't really go.  It was some sort of raspberry cheesecake thing and individually they were fine, they just didn't blend well.

We had high hopes for the place, we were just disappointed.  It's possible that the traditional pizza is good, but what we had just wasn't that great.  And the service definitely left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Calamari is fresh and I was surprised how damn good it was last time.  I was thinking it was the beer buzz but nope, it's the the fresh calamari.  Get the Founders breakfast stout or the BOSS Aces & Ates.  GOFORTHEBREWHAS"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. I came to Revolution Ale House with high hopes of a tasty pizza and awesome beer.... Didn't happen. They do have a pretty decent beer list which was plus though! My and I friend arrived on a semi busy Saturday night. We had a seat at the bar and ordered drink while we waited for our table, which didn't take long at all. We were taken back to our back patio table after about 5 minutes. We were finally greeted by our server who seemed a bit out of it.... We were in the mood for a margarita pizza and ordered it, he told us he didn't recommend it, that it is thin like a cracker and he \"sees a lot of disappointed faces when he brings it to the table\"...um okay, not a good sign but thanks for your honesty... Soo we ordered the build your own pizza (where each ingredient cost a dollar extra) with tomato, basil and mozzarella (but it also came doused with balsamic vinaigrette like the menu margarita pizza version).. It was okay, very small and not worth the price. We also each ordered a side Caesar salad.. Bland and no flavor. It took a while to get refills and our check (our server said he got sat with a 13 top...okay understandable), when we got our check it was wrong and we had to wait 10 mins more just to get him to come back to our table... Overall... I might come back but just to hang out at the bar."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall

I dig the vibe and some of the 'za at Revolution. This is one of those places that I always pass by while in NoDa and, for some reason, rarely stop in. Allow me to break it down for ya...

The Good: The patio is lovely, the place is giant. As Tonya mentioned, this is surely a wonderful spot to grab a few pints, a pizza and hang out for a while. The staff here are super laid back and very friendly - and I hear they have trivia, too! Weekday specials are pretty solid as well - it definitely helps curb the price of the specialty pies. A particular pie I really enjoyed is the NoDa - Grateful Growers pulled pork in all its glory, carmelized onions, peppers and deliciousness. Nommmm!

The Meh: The Carolina Cyclops pie really disappointed me - it was like munching on a salt block. The first bite was the best - the cracked egg tempered the salty pancetta, ham and cheese. But I couldn't have any more after that bite. Sad, salt laden pizza. 

Nevertheless, I'll definitely head back to Revolution for another go - their beer selections is stellar and I'd love to find a few go-to pies to love and adore!"}
{"text":"Ugh. This place has gone drastically down-hill since we moved here 3.5 years ago. And it shows! 

The restaurant inside smelled musty and was hot, the service was sub-par, the menu has been cut in half, barely anyone was in the restaurant (compared to 3 years ago when the tables were filled), the food was mediocre at best (I had the falafel and he had a calzone drenched in oil), and my beer was flat.
It honestly seems like the restaurant is going out of business and they have lost hope.

Even though we are neighbors, we won't be returning :("}
{"text":"I have no idea what happened to the other people who have bad reviews but both times i have come here i have received great service, food and beer. The bar staff is very knowledgeable and my bruschetta was great. I haven't had a chance to try pizza from here but there appetizers are delicious and the laid back chill environment with fresh noda beer flowing from the tap is reason enough to come back."}
{"text":"Best place in noda to sample beer. They sell half pints! Food is great. The Noda pie is one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Had a great time and a great meal at RA tonight. Ordered a New York and a veggie calzone, along with dark horse wine and some good draft beers. Our server (Jamie) was friendly, helpful and attentive. Everything was fresh and delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of picky about my pizza - I like it NY style with whole milk mozzarella, a thin crust, and not too much sauce. Revolution does a good job with all of these things, and I'm glad to have found them.

I like the fact that you can make your own pizza at Revolution - that is, you choose your base (oil/garlic or tomato sauce), add your toppings, pick your cheese (including whole milk mozzarella), and add any oils (such as truffle oil or spicy oil). I chose a 10\" pizza with an oil/garlic base, arugula, artichoke hearts, mozzarella, and truffle oil. My hubby had a 10\" tomato base pizza with prosciutto, pepperoni, artichokes, mozzarella, and a spicy oil. 

The pizzas were delivered pretty quickly, and the crusts were not burnt or overdone. The toppings were generous - almost too much so with the arugula (which completely covered the pizza and was not chopped), and the truffle oil (it was a bit drippy). Overall, the flavors were great and we thought these pizzas were winners.

For you beer lovers, Revolution has quite a few draft and bottled beers to choose from. They also have a nice dessert selection at the front, so I would suggest checking that out before you sit down and place your order. (We had the delicious meat and cheese tray as an appetizer, and were too full for dessert.)

While parking is always a pain in NODA, Revolution Pizza is definitely worth the trip. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My fave neighborhood spot to meet my friends. The bartenders and managers are cool and fun to talk to. Love their drink selection, they always have food specials every time I'm there. Heard they do brunch now. Can't wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"I have only come here for pick up orders so I cannot comment on the overall dining experience,  but I will say that they have the best pizza I have had in town. I would say the crust is what sets Revolution's pizza apart from all other pizza places in town. It's awesomeness is hard to describe in words so I will not attempt to, but I will say that I am usually a person who cares only about the toppings on my pizza rather than the crust, so I feel that this is really saying something.

Another nice touch is the gelato bar that they have next to the actual bar, where you can order 8-10 different flavors of gelato.  This was definitely a big hit for my four year old nephew.  Unfortunately, after sampling the gelato and getting a small cup order, he wanted nothing to do with his pizza, so parents be warned.

I look forward to eating at this restaurant again and enjoying the full dining experience at this restaurant.

The pizza is a little on the expensive side, but as you can gather from my comments, it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite place in NoDa. I love the patio and all the craft beer. Great place to start the night or take a date"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here to try and grab a quick dinner around 7:30 at night. We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess, but then sat there for 20 minutes with no one coming over to even great us or take our drink orders. The place was more than half empty and at least three waitresses walked by our table multiple times and would just smile at us and then continue to walk. I was a waiter for 7 years so I understand that sometimes one gets weeded and things get lost in the shuffle but this was not the case here and 20 minutes is entirely too long even if the place was packed. Absolutely no excuse for the horrific service. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Some nights, during the summer, it'll be sauna hot, a cloud of humid, sweat smelling air hovering around your table, but your pie'll still come out luke-warm-cold, while your beer's all unpleasantly tepid, and you'll swear you ain't comin back.

And then you will, because it's the best damn beer selection in the city, and you'll gamble, getting an egg on your mushroom pie, and hell if it doesn't come out perfectly - just solid enough to keep it together while you grab a slice, glossy yolk still runny, making an otherwise OK pie stellar.  

Pizza roulette. I'll keep playing."}
{"text":"This place used to be a mellow mushroom a few years ago that featured fully furnished upside down rooms (hence the very tall ceilings). Despite wishing that they had left the upside down rooms and not removed them, the new tenants have done a great job in keeping the place a \"go to\" destination. They have a massive selection of local craft beers and a good menu. The service is good and they even have a few game nights which are always fun!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza in town. Bland tasteless sauce, cheap generic mozzarella, and waaaay over priced."}
{"text":"Ok listen up. This place is great. My wife and I were skeptical after reading some of the crappy reviews people left prior to our visit, however we were pleasantly surprised with the service and food quality. I urge you to this place out for yourself. 
Now to the food. We had the Revolution pizza and wings. FANTASTIC! Gelato was freakin awesome. So there you have it."}
{"text":"The last time I stopped by this house in the heart of NODA, it was many years ago.  I still get that same remIninscent vibe as the days of old.  We stopped in for dinner with a friend, before a show at the newly opened Roux.  Front porch seats are where it's at for grabbing a bite and a few drinks!

The highlights for me include the view, the large beer selection, and the wine.  I also enjoy the pizza, but we didn't grab for anything crazy, just a large sausage and pepperoni.  Also, it was pretty cool to find out next time we could bring our four-legged friends on the porch for dinner!

A few letdowns here, as well.  The calamari was way overlooked, rubbery, and the breading would not stay on.  The marinara sauce was so-so, different than anything I've had before.  Though it was busy, our service was still subpar.  The waitress was very nice but would disappear for periods at a time.  None of us got refills, and whatever we asked for, it took forever.  We noticed the server for the tables beside us constantly taking care of her customers, so I'm prone to believe the issue was only with our waitress and not the entire staff.

I'm sure I'll be back here.  I dig the urban, artsy vibe that Revolution has going on.  The porch is really a highlight!"}
{"text":"Awesome bartender David took the time to let me and the bf try a few different beers. David was very patient, knowledgable and welcoming. New to NoDa and already know that Evolution will be a go to spot.

Ended up meeting some really cool guys at the bar and very diverse. They also serve food which I didn't order this was strictly a liquid visit but will come back since they appear to have a nice following. 

Looking for a good beer spot that serves food, great selection of beer and awesome bartenders then check out Evolution which is also a local favorite from those I've talked too."}
{"text":"Looking for your above average pizza while you're in NoDa? Then look no further than Revolution. Really.. You won't have to look far because it's right in the heart of NoDa. They hold down the most popular corner with 44+ beer taps, a full bar, plus many craft cans as well. 

Not only is it a great place to drink local brews but there are lots of gourmet pizzas to choose from as well. They have wonderful appetizers too, I suggest trying the garlic knots or ravioli! They have plenty of seating inside as well as a huge patio that overlooks North Davidson Street. They have plenty of TVs by the bar to ensure you won't miss your favorite game(s). 

Every day is a different type of special on beers and appetizers and food. So check out their social media to find out! Everyone there is super friendly and I will always return!!"}
{"text":"90 million beers on tap but only one cider (and no gluten-free beers). Doesn't compute! I know that Charlotte is a beer town, but no options for those of us who can't tolerate normal beer? Patio was insanely loud. The food was a complete yawner and not at all cheap. Other than that, staff seems incredibly nice and were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed by this place.  We sat outside and the table we were sat at was pretty disappointing.  It just seemed old and rickety.  We ordered two pizzas to share between three.  Both were all right.  One was a little soupy, and overall I was sadden to find a place I thought would be so good was quite disappointing.  The one thing they got for them was the day we went in on Thursday was 3 dollars for all of their drafts which they have a very large selection of including many local beers."}
{"text":"We have lived in the Noda area for a few years now, and grew up going to shows at Neighborhood Theatre (across from Revolution) when Revolution used to Mellow Mushroom. Lets just say, I never understood why the amazing Mellow Mushroom left in the first place, and I certainly don't understand now, after giving Revolution so many second chances.

I have never been impressed with Revolutions food. The only reason we would go was for Trivia Night on Wednesdays because it was the only restaurant in the area that did trivia.  I learned quickly that I should eat dinner before trivia because I was so underwhelmed with the food.  To give them credit, their beer selection is on point, which is all that matters for trivia.  

We hadn't gone to trivia in a while so the other night we decided to go.  I also surprised my boyfriend when I told him I actually wanted to try the food out again (how can you screw up a salad, right? I'll get to that...).  When we arrived we waited for 10 minutes to be seated (we have NEVER had to wait to be seated on trivia night). They seemed SO unorganized, but hey, at least they had the AC on this time.  Once we were seated, we waited 40 minutes to get our food!  I was VERY annoyed at that point because people who came in after us were getting food before us although I noticed some tables waiting for a ridiculous amount of time get their food as well.  When our waitress finally brought our food out, one of our friends reminded her that he had a side salad with his meal.  She proceeds to cop an attitude with our entire table, saying \"Guys I'm gonna need you to be patient. I only have two hands!\" In my head I was thinking, excuse you!! Patient?!! How's waiting without complaining for 40 minutes to get salads and sandwiches??? I'm glad I wasn't the one speaking to her or else I would have gone off.  We honestly were being so respectful, even when we had plenty of reasons to get short with her! (You don't speak to customers the way she spoke to us. EVER) So I get my Revolution Caesar salad (which comes with cherry tomatoes, pancetta, and croutons) and garlic knots.  I kid you not, I had 1/2 of a cherry tomato on my whole salad, and the pancetta was burnt, BURNT to black! I was shocked! I wish I'd taken a picture.  I was so over the whole night at that point I didn't even say anything, just ate around it.  As I'm going in to eat another garlic knot, I find a freaking BUG ON MY PLATE! Not just any bug, it was either a small beetle or a small roach!!!!!! I said, \"that's it!\" When the waitress came over to check on our meals, I started off by showing her the burnt pancetta, then let her know 1/2 a cherry tomato was unacceptable, and ended with the disgusting bug.  They offered me another meal after apologizing, which I declined.  Of course they didn't charge me.  

I have given them chance after chance and I'm DONE! I can confidently say I will NEVER go back to eat here, EVER. And its a shame too, because there aren't a ton on food options in the neighborhood, and unfortunately they are a waste in a spacious, and central location. Their spot in Midtown went out of buisness so hopefully its just a matter of time before they go out of business too! The sooner, the better.  Noda can do so much better! In the meantime, if you want an excellent slice of pizza, go to Fuel. Benny's isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Checked out Revolution's new menu last night. (I wish they would update their website, it still has the old menu.) I was glad to see expanded offerings with more apps, salads, sandwiches, and specialty pizzas to choose from. Two interesting things I'd like to try in the future were the avocado with eggs and the cilantro bean salad. There are lots of options for vegetarians and some vegan items. 
We had the pulled pork sliders app and they were so delicious. I really appreciate that they use local Grateful Growers pork and the sliders were topped with a purple slaw on soft sesame seed buns. 
We usually get the NoDa pizza, which I am thankful is on the new menu, but since we'd already had the sliders we went with the veggie Hippie and added cheese. It was great with hearty toppings. I have always thought their pizza was some of the best in Charlotte, but it is the more gourmet type of pizza.  Large pizzas are around $22-$25. 
As others have mentioned, service can be so-so here. Our server was pleasant and tried to be attentive but he was very busy. I think they were understaffed with only 2-3 servers doing everything. I try to avoid going when I think it will be busy. 
Their beer offerings are fantastic and can't be beat by most places. They also have specials every weeknight including all drafts for $3 on Thursdays and they offer half-pints."}
{"text":"Met the gals here for a pre-concert dinner.  Outdoor seating was full, so we sat  on the glassed in veranda.  Sun was  hitting me in the eye like a big pizza pie, so our server kindly adjusted the blinds.
My friends were thrilled with the seasonal beer list.  I got a glass of Chardonnay, which suited me just fine.
I ordered the falafel wrap.  It came well stuffed and with some potato chips that appeared to be homemade.  A sprinkle of salt, and they were good.  The wrap was either one very big one divided in two, or two separate ones.  It was fine, but a little more flavor would have been appreciated.
I would love to come back and try their pizza.  My friends enjoyed the ones that they ordered.  And service was so efficient that we made our concert on time."}
{"text":"I had the Calzone, tasted like garlic cheesy bread. YUMMY :) they have great beer selection too!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews, good or bad, but today I feel obligated. Went here today with my friend and boy was it a let down. How the place has fell off. Used to be pretty good. First off it was odd that there was not a soul in the place on a Saturday. We both got the beer on special and it was as flat as could be. And then the wings, not bad but they took extremely long for us being the only two people in there, and on too of that we only got one tiny little ramekin of ranch to spilt between us both, after I asked for a couple ranches. Then the pizza came, or poor excuse for pizza that is. So many toppings, yet no flavor whatsoever. I take that back. I could taste the burnt bottom of it. All in all what turned out to be what I think was honestly the worst experience I've had in a restaurant, ended up costing me almost $40. Needless to say I'll take that money elsewhere next time. Sad."}
{"text":"WTF? Let me start by saying that I understand every restaurant has a bad day, but c'mon.

Last night a group of coworkers gathered to celebrate a birthday here. We walked in blindly after having tried to call numerous times throughout the day to give heads up that a party of 20+ would be arriving around 7. Each call attempt went unanswered. This should've been our 1st clue. As 1st to arrive from our group, I told the ever unenthusiastic hostess that we'd need a table for 20. Prior to arrival, I thought this would surely be a hiccup to pull off on a Sat night in thriving NoDa. However, to my surprise, the place was near empty. The hostess greets me w/, \"We are out of food. We have no wings, no veggies, no apps, and can only do cheese or pepperoni pizza. Still wanna eat here?\" I'll pause for you to process that just as I had to...

I can only imagine the look on my face. I tell her 20 people are en route, so the likelihood of us being able to collectively pick up and move elsewhere is slim. I thought to myself, \"Well, at least they have alcohol!\"  

The hostess asks if I want to speak to a mgr. I reiterated that it is what it is and we're celebrating a b-day. There's no turning back. A few min later the mgr shows up w/the same story and asks if I still want to be seated. Yes, for the 3rd time, I still want to be seated. They disappear for almost 10 min trying to put some tables together. In the meantime 3 smaller groups come in and are all huddled around the door waiting for the hostess who is off in never never land. She returns to take me to my table and in no way acknowledges the other people waiting. As I'm escorted back, someone emerges from the kitchen w/a Kitchen Closed sign to tape to the door. What. Is. Happening?

Once seated I'm greeted by a server who reassures me that they do in fact have more than just cheese and pepperoni. She explains that they are out of a lot, and says that it was just a busy day for them, but she's happy to talk through what they do have. She disappears. I eventually flag her down to order a beer and see that other members of my party have arrived. They've made a stop at the bar for drinks. They attempt to order Fireball.  

Bartender: We're all out of Fireball.  
Coworker: Okay, so how about some Jamison?
BT: We're all out of Jamison too.
CW: Who does your bar order? Do you realize it's a Sat night in NoDa?
BT: *blank stare*

It only gets better. As the rest of the group assembles, the waitress is ghost. People keep going to the bar for drinks, or at least what they have of them, and everyone starts the night off w/simple chatter and warm b-day wishes for the guest of honor. Eventually our server emerges and starts to get a round of drinks, though most people already have them from the bar. I order a 2nd beer. She disappears. When she returns w/my beer and a few other drinks at least 15 min later, she starts asking about app needs. Fried raviolis, 2 orders of knots, and 2 orders of friend pickles are placed. Another 25 min pass before we're served knots w/a cold doughy center and some fried ravioli. Only then are we informed they are out of pickles. The waitress asks the b-day girl, seated next to me, what she would like to do about her pickle order. The b-day girl replies, \"cancel them.\" WTH other option was there?

Just like that our server's gone again. She'd previously informed us that we were her only table. We all can't help but to wonder WTH she is doing since she's clearly not attending to us. By then, my boss has started barking orders at the bar tenders and is at one point behind the bar herself. The mgr's made no appearance at the table to apologize for the circumstances and things are complete chaos for 20+ hungry people. Our group had grown to 27; more than anticipated. When we eventually get to order, the mgr comes out to help since the waitress is overwhelmed from having done nothing at all thus far. He fails to identify himself as the mgr and only I know him as such from our earlier interaction.

More time passes by. Now after 9, 2 hrs in and food comes out for 1/2 the table. I'm amongst the 1/2 w/food, yet have no food. I think nothing of it and just assume mine will be coming out w/the others'. Eventually their food comes. The waitress has cleared my empty beer glasses. I flag her down to and ask why I have no food and no drink? She says my food came out and someone else must've eaten it. Not the case. She reappears and apologizes saying I'll get a LG instead of SM pizza. \"Yes, because I can eat a LG.\" Her reply? \"Good.\" OMG!

Why didn't someone just go buy supplies at the Teeter? You saw you were running low. Don't get me started on the check fiasco. I'm too close to the character limit to go on, but this entire evening was a total bust. The only good part was the laughter amongst my great work peers. Revolution should be ashamed. We, sadly, only had cheese, pepp, and bacon pizzas, despite the appealing menu. The cheese pizza wasn't even cooked. Fail."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pie and a few brews Saturday evening. It had been a couple months, which is a long time between visits for me, and I discovered they had redone the bar area.  About doubled the bar length. I am usually alone and prefer sitting at the bar which in the past was often full. No trouble getting a seat now.  They added TV's too so there was a game to watch from every seat.

The pizza was great as usual. Same great crust. Same fresh toppings. So yummy. 

It was their 4th anniversary and they had some special limited availability brews on tap. And of course their usual huge and tasty lineup of \"reagular\" tap beers.  Awesome. 

Only 4 stars this time because they had the music blasting way too loud. I was told the managers were trying to create a party atmosphere for the anniversary celebration. Could barely communicate with the bartenders was so loud."}
{"text":"We love to come here for the flights and pizza! Have always been seated right away. Service could be a little better, I had to wait 20 minutes to receive my check once. Other than that, I have no complaints. Its a great location, right across the street from the Blind Pig and rest of the fun parts of Noda. 

Our favorite pizza, El chupacabra! Love the avocado ranch dressing that comes on top. We split a large for $24 (small is $13 I believe) between the three of us and we were stuffed. I struggled to eat 2 pieces. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"You know, we used to LOVE this place. And it seems like we're not the only ones lately who aren't loving a NoDa landmark. We've been there only a handful of times since changing ownership in recent years. Each time we walk away underwhelmed for one reason or another.

1) Date night special and half price half pints is gone. Need I say more.
2) slow service
3) cold pizza brought out last time
4) tonight- our favorite build your own came out with liquid crust.

Tonight seals the deal for us that this place isn't going to last."}
{"text":"From the managers mouth, he stated \"40 to 45 minutes is the typical wait time for food.\" We got out appetizers after 45 minutes in and were then told that they they ran out of mozzarella, \"so I guess you guys have to to order something else.\" I have to say we were all young professionals and the manager was not sympathetic to our concerns at all. Apparently, the customer is always right doesn't apply to this establishment. We've been here over an hour and still haven't gotten our food. If you like waiting over an hour for tomatoes, cheese and lettuce, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Please just close already. We know it's going to happen. Tonight was theist time I'll go. No beer on tap. Out of half your stuff. Took 3 hours for dinner when the place was empty. I give up. The place is sold so no one cares. It shows."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place but this is the second time i had to wait 45 mins not even for my pizza but my garlic knots and then to tell me my pizza was just getting put in and would be another 15 mins.  for a small pizza.  i get its busy and the kitchen may be backed up but either the kitchen isnt big enough or your staff just sucks.  I tried this place for a second time hoping for better but it wasnt.  I will say me and my friend will never go back there again after that! better places to eat in noda ! seeeeee you neverrr revoultion ale house"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here before a concert at the neighborhood theater. Its a pizza parlor, so we ordered one of their specialty pizza's. It seemed a little greasy, but it was tasty. They had some good craft beer options and other drink options. Overall, it was a good spot to stop in before the concert. Probably worthwhile coming later in the evening when things get a little more hopping."}
{"text":"Great space and location.  I didn't try the pizza, but it looked good coming out of the kitchen and onto other people's tables.  I opted for the pesto pasta... which was ginormous.  The chicked was cooked really well - still moist and the spices they used on the chicken was really flavorful.

The other reason for our visit to Revolution was to participate in a Friday night gallery crawl.  Unfortunately there were only a couple of galleries opened and I noticed some of them had relocated elsewhere since I had been there last.

NoDa is definitely a cool area, but maybe the \"rush\" to be in the area isn't once as it used to be.  The area still has a lot of things going for it, but I am hoping the economy picks up so the arts community can thrive again.

Back to the restaurant itself... I definitely will come back to try their other menu offerings and beer selection."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, usually right before another event in the area.  I figure it's a good place to stop before a show or in the most recent case, the Queen City Brewers Festival.

The menu consists of pizza, calzones, sandwiches, salads and a few appetizers.  The pizza flavors are creative but the flavors never really appealed to me.   I've had the pizza and the calzones here and the flavors always fell flat here.  

The best reason to come here is for the beer.  They have a great selection of local and regional beers on draft and a several others in bottle form.   

Service can be good or average, however, it's never been exceptional on any of my visits."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza. Was told that the large pizza dough wasn't working? Instead we were given two small pizzas (at no extra charge to us!) that were burnt to ash on the bottom. The waiter dropped the food and disappeared so we had to wait to send the ash pizza back. The new pizza was better but still had ash on the crust that had to be dusted off. There are plenty of other pizza places in Charlotte that at least will give you an unburnt large pizza."}
{"text":"A Pub Grubbers heaven, mind you walking in you really feel like you're strolling into an average pizzaria not a pub. 

However under close inspection of their beer selection you quickly realize the person responsible for this list is a traveling connoisseur of liquid pleasure.

They offer some obscure finds that are only known to the local regions of Nor Cal, The Rockies, New England, The Gulf and of course Carolina. I was more than pleasantly surprised to say the least and to celebrate I drank my fair share!

Oh Yea, their pulled pork bbq was good too but the beer and casual chill out atmosphere is the reason I'll be back."}
