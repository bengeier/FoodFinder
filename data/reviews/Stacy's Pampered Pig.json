{"text":"haven't been here for a while since they messed up my order but I decided to come back and try again.  Bad decision. After waiting an hour for my food, they come out and kept telling my it's on its way out. They then came and asked me what I ordered again and that's when I just asked them for a refund. Eventually a manager came out and gave me a refund. Offered to give me the food for free and told me it was on the way out. After anther 10mins of it not being done I bounced. It's sad because I really try to support black business but I'm never returning here. Gonna get my bbq from Bobby Q's. Good value, bomb food and always on point. Don't play yourself by coming here like I did"}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich. What can I say about it? Bleh. Never coming back here again. the brisket was so charred and dry I couldn't eat half the meat in the sandwich. And it was really greasy and salty. Usually I like the fat on brisket but this fat was just gross salty greasy and hard. The bun was good tho. That's the only think I actually liked. Very disappointing. The restaurant was hot and very dingy. The girls were nice. The bbq sauce isn't the best I had but it helped cover up the taste of the brisket."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. I would definitely come back. Only thing I would recommend is advertising and making stacys pampered pig sign bigger so they can see it from the street. You can only see BBQ. Own that sign! Now I know where it is I'll be back for more of that southern goodness!"}
{"text":"If I can give this a place no stars I would they don't even deserve to have any stars I went  in a couple hours ago the beef rib beef tips  were  so dry it was disgusting.... I will never be backing"}
{"text":"We decided to walk from our hotel to find something to eat and we came across this establishment. We decided to go in and were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was very clean first of all. The woman working there was incredibly friendly and we enjoyed speaking with her. The show started when the food came out. This is some of the best barbecue that I have had in some time. I had the chicken sandwich and my wife had the grilled cheese with brisket. Both of these sandwiches were amazing. We gave out compliments to the chef and he came out to chat with us a bit. You should definitely stop by this place if you're looking for killer barbecue made by great people. Hats off to Stacy for his killer barbecue."}
{"text":"First time here. A little hard to find but the delicious BBQ smell led me in. I'm a fan of the Mac and Cheese. Great specials that change everyday, like them on Facebook. Met Stacy himself, he is so amazing. Been in Arizona for decades and in the food business for longer. The bar will soon be up and once it is a whole side will be for blue's. There's potential. Come for the food."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we will definitely be back. I had the Pampered Pig Sandwich with potatoes salad. The sandwich was piled high with Briskwt, Pulled Pork, pulled Chicken, and hotlinks. It was huge! Tim had Brisket Sliders and Fries. On th recommendation of other reviews we ordered Mac n Cheese too. All the food was great tasting and worth the price.

If you leave here hungry, it's your own fault!!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the city of Detroit I was spoiled with some of the best soul food to grace any table. My search for yummy authentic fried chicken, collard greens and mac n cheese in Phoenix has taken years with much disappointment up until now. Thank you Stacy's Pampered Pig! Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time to this restaurant and it won't be my last.

As everyone who knows me will tell you, I love BBQ. A true carnivore!! I'm that freak who order's the 72oz steak and finishes it in half an hour..

But if it's not cooked properly, after only a few bites I'll leave.. 

So when I was driving home from dropping my daughter off to hang out with friends, I noticed a plain sign that said \"BBQ\". (I'd seen it before, but hadn't had the opportunity to try it)I decided, why not, I've not had lunch yet.
I pulled in, the lot was pretty empty (not a real good sign). Parked and went on in. (Only one other customer) 
The restaurant is pretty large and could handle large groups and looks more like a country sports bar than a restaurant..
I was greeted by a man and a woman behind the bar who were very friendly.
The woman took my order( half pound of brisket, half pound of rib tips and a small order of fries to go)
It came to just under $20.00.
When my order was ready, the man opened each to-go box and showed me my food, then bagged it up fer me.
Now, I must say I was impressed by the fact that everything was in its own container and the BBQ sauce was also packaged separately. Sauce can so easily ruin good meat..
I sped home to try my newest finds..
The brisket was quite good, moist and tender, but I've had better.. But this was in my top 5..
The fries were yer run of the mill crinkle cut frozen French fries, but they were perfect and crisp, not soggy at all.. Not even to much salt!
But the rib tips.. OMG.. They were out of this world delish.. Moist, tender and juicy.. They needed no sauce.. Perfectly seasoned and cooked!!
The absolute best I've ever had!!!!

This place is so unassuming, but you have got to try it.. A friend of mine is a local food critic and I will be recommending she try it soon..
A 4.8 **** star rating from me.."}
{"text":"I literally just got back from picking up lunch from this place and my food is gone...it's only been 15 mins. I got the 1/4 lb brisket with two sides. OMG!! The sides are phenomenal.  I got the okra and collard greens. The brisket was good but not my favorite. My co worker got the catfish with Mac n cheese and green beans....delicious and not one bad thing about his meal. The cornbread is on point!! So much more to try out on menu that I'm already looking for the next time."}
{"text":"Stacy's BBQ was a total disappointment  for me. I went there with a friend for dinner and we both ordered the brisket dinner with two sides. I had coleslaw and BBQ beans and he had mac and cheese and rice with gravy. Our food was served on a cafeteria tray lined with paper and no plates except for the sides which came in a Styrofoam cup. While trying to cut through the brisket the paper liner now wet and sticking to my brisket caused me to have to pick the bits of paper out of my meat in order to eat it. Both my friend and I were disappointed in the quality of the food because it didn't taste fresh and was quite frankly unappealing. I would have to say I will not be going back to Stacy's again."}
{"text":"We weren't sure the place was open when we first arrived. Only one car in the lot for dinner. My husband said we should give it a shot. I wasn't hungry. I 'm so glad he did. Apparently they just opened and are still awaiting liquor license, so half the building isn't used, yet. Ordered a 2 meat plate (pulled pork and hot links with cowboy beans, suggested by gentleman up front). Pork was cooked to perfection, and lightly seasoned with sauce on the side. More on the sauce in a bit. Hot link was sliced. Great flavor with a kick. I wasn't expecting much from beans.  They had a full flavor and we're tender. The mild sauce was sweet, but not super sweet. The only BBQ I like is my husband's, but almost ate over half of his dinner. 
This place was so good we went there again 2 days later.  Ribs were moist, spicy sauce was good.  Potato salad and mac and cheese as good as you wish your Grammy made. This makes me want to move to Phoenix."}
{"text":"O. M. G!!!! Pulled pork nachos. Order them and devour them. You're welcome. BBQ beans are great, too! Coleslaw crisp and cold! Very vinegary- not at all sweet like others, but still delicious! Highly recommend!!! Delivery through GrubHub did take the full 60 to 70 minutes that I was quoted. Food was hot on delivery and oh so delicious!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Got half lb of the brisket, hot links, pulled pork and rip tips. Also got greens and mac and cheese. Meats cooked great, hot links aren't hot but still great. The BBQ is also delicious. Pulled pork is nice and tender and the rib tips have an awesome rub on them. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Rib tips & brisket...outstanding! Brisket practically melts in your mouth. Tips very flavorful & meaty. Sauce is really good & obviously homemade recipe...no bottled stuff here! I had the greens & mac & cheese for my sides. Both were excellent, very cheesy mac. Definitely a new stop on my food ventures."}
{"text":"BBQ is probably the most subjective of foods to judge. In my book Stacy's is the real deal. Ordered pulled pork sandwich, coleslaw and asked if they had cobber which they did, peach. Those 3 items are always my first order at new place.

I've made 14-20 hour pork shoulder and what I was served was 100% perfect pulled pork. The bun was perfect, good quality bread, toasted. The meat was super hot, probably out of the microwave...but that's perfectly OK. It just isn't reasonable to think you're going to roll into a BBQ place and expect right out of the cooker pulled pork. The real art is how you keep the perfect between the time it comes out of the cooker until it's served. And Stacy nailed. Other than that super hot microwave give away the pulled pork looked and tasted like right out of the cooker. Can't ask for more. And this wasn't ground up shredded pork. It was a mix of some nice chunks...actual \"pulled\". Portion wasn't crazy big, but I'd say big.

The pork didn't need any sauce...cause it was good by itself, but did add a little of the mild sauce. It's a sweet red sauce. There were a couple of hot sauce choices too which I didn't try.

I found no chunks of fat, wasn't greasy, wasn't dry, wasn't overly seasoned as most of the favor came from actual slow cooking. Flawless.

Coleslaw varies a lot, depends on your taste. I loved Stacy's coleslaw. It's the mayo creamy type. Wasn't soggy, wasn't too crisp, it was just right. It was their small size and it was plenty.

I didn't see the cobber on the menu or chalkboard so had to ask. It was a large portion and was real made on site cobber, not frozen whatever from the restaurant supply. Again, clobber varies a lot. This had lots of gooey, lots of sauce and plenty of peaches which were probably from a can, but good quality. Again, I don't mind one bit if the peaches weren't flown in from Argentina that morning. They were very good quality. There was a taste in the clobber I didn't like a lot, not sure what it was. But that's just my taste, you might love it. I certainly ate all of mine. I might even order it again so it wasn't really a problem.

Ambiance...yup, not the Four Seasons. Perfect though for a BBQ place, don't change a thing.

Service was surprisingly a bit slow. I was the only one in the place at 1pm om a Tues. The pulled pork and coleslaw has to be pre-made. So the bun had to be toasted.. It was probably only 5-10 minutes, but still surprised it took that long. It might be they don't want to bring it out in 1 minute to keep some illusion that they slowed cooked a 15 lbs pork shoulder just for me, in 5 minutes. But, for all I know they did need that time to get the pork into shape because it was perfect as I said.

Coke, no Pepsi. I had a Dr Pepper for $2.50, a little steep but not crazy, and the waitress did bring me a refill. Pulled pork sandwich was $8 which I thought was actually on the cheap side for what I got. Coleslaw is normally $2 but for free during the lunch special. The cobber must have been about $5 which was reasonable as it would be plenty for 2 people.

And I can walk there."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! The fried chicken is to die for!! Ive also tried the fried shrimp which are also super tasty. Ive ordered on uber eats twice now and it always comes blazing hot! Try to the cobbler too! The first time it was sold out so I ended up receiving a delicious and large slice of german chocolate cake. This time I got the cobbler and see why it was sold out- absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's hidden in a shopping center off Osborn and 7th Ave. The staff was very friendly and the food was amazing. You have to give it a try! Plus they have fried okra!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona they actually smoke there meat not like all these other places you cant boil meat and call it BBQ.The food is amazing the staff is great!!!
Great food Great people"}
{"text":"Well after looking at all the good reviews, I decided to give this place a chance... So I get there early ready to have fresh smoked meat that smells great from the parking lot... Well to my surprise the food taste like crap... The hot links were terrible and way too soft, the brisket didn't taste like good quality meat let alone brisket, and the Mac & Cheese was an F'n joke... I payed $20 for this terrible food and felt sick the rest of the day, I will never eat at this place again... They must have good food, but I didn't get that today..."}
{"text":"Great place - was more than I was expecting in a good way! Staff was very friendly and easy to talk to. Their nachos are amazing! Large portions you will not go hungry! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked it here the first few visits. We raved about the fried chicken, Friday fish fry, fried catfish, pulled pork and some of the sides. The recent 2 visits were a disappointment. Cold sides, cold pork ribs and the fried chicken cooked in the same oil as the fish. The iced tea wasn't good either. I was hoping this place was going to make it since it's within walking distance for me and I love BBQ. But I can't see paying top dollar anymore and not liking it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fried pork chops and the hot link sandwich. Friendly service, fair prices. Can't wait to try the ribs. 


The only thing I'd like to see is the Okra crispier, along with the fries. They're good but both just a tad soggy. A tad. 


The barbecue sauce here is also some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews on this place, and I decided to try it out. Like others I am a barbecue fiend.  I ordered 1/2 half pound of pulled pork & 1/2 pound of brisket.  The food was awesome. But the restaurant had a musty smell, like the place had been vacant and closed up for months.  I asked the man who took my  order and he said it used to be a bar and that their liquor license was pending. While waiting I noticed that the place could probably use a good cleaning, as there were glasses on a shelf behind the bar, looked like they had months of dust on them. I will be back because of the food."}
{"text":"They've got a ways to go on ambiance and getting the details down.  We went for lunch our server was working alone and this was her second day. She was easy to talk to and very helpful. We weren't impressed with the sides, but the BBQ was great. I had a pulled pork sandwich and my man had ribs (dry rubbed)."}
{"text":"Great food great service. We will be back. ...The owner Stacy is very friendly down to earth guy and serves up some delicious bbq. The staff Angel and Solomon are friendly and helpful.  The food speaks for itself.  Homemade and delicious.  We definitely recommend every one try it."}
{"text":"I was really hopeful and wanted to write a great review but my first visit may be my last. I've been cooking Q a long time and know how to cook and serve it. You serve it hot and fresh. In a commercial setting, barbecue places need to keep some meats cold after the cook and reheat before serving and I'm okay with that as long as it resembles hot, and tasty food.

I called this order in on the Yelp app and was prepaid. After waiting for my order a few minutes another guy walks in and orders almost my exact order and was served and left 5 minutes before I got my order that I called in about 30 minutes earlier. 

After a quick inspection at the bar the server quickly opened each box to show me the contents of my items. BBQ Nachos, Fried tomatoes, Brisket sandwich, fried chicken wings. It all looked great.
I live 200 yards from this place and was completely disappointed when I got home three minutes later to share with my family.

Like I said from appearance it all looked great but the chicken wings were at a perfect room temperature, not cold not warm. On the first bite I found them under-cooked and pulled a small piece of raw chicken from the bone and finished them in my microwave.

The Fried tomatoes were warm but had sat so long they were soggy and unable to eat with your fingers because they just fell apart limp. 
The brisket sandwich was very dry and cold (room temperature). 
The Nachos were slightly warm but smothered in messy canned cheese sauce that made us all queasy. 

The food tasted better after warming it in the microwave but they are lucky to get 2 stars letting any meats walk out the door at room temperature. What a shame."}
{"text":"Definitely there's room for improvement here, but I want to be generous with this review and encourage others to come here and help this place step its game up. I had the two meat plate with pulled pork, 2 ribs, and slaw. The best thing was the slaw, very creamy, loved it, devoured it. 

The pulled pork is not bad. Served with sauce on the side (which I really appreciate), the texture is more like chopped meat than pulled, stringy pork. But it was pleasantly chewy, good smoke flavor, a bit bland with no sauce at all, but just a little sauce made it pretty darn good. (I usually avoid sauce, I'm a dry rub guy in most situations.) This sauce was very good though. Nice balance of tanginess and sweetness (most BBQ sauces are too sweet, in my opinion.) 

Ribs were okay. Just two in this combo, and they're not big or especially meaty. You get more than twice as much pulled pork as you get rib meat. There could be a more generous spice rub on the ribs for my tastes, or they could have shakers of spice rub on the table. Meat texture was pretty good, on the dry, flaky side, which I consider proper with BBQ ribs. Clearly they have *not* been steamed or braised, just smoked. That's all good. Were they great ribs? I have to say no. But the place is still pretty new, and these things take time to get dialed in.  Ribs get a 6 out of 10. 

I'll give them another try soon. Several other meats to try, and plenty of sides. 

Service was friendly and efficient. Value for money was not bad, I'd say excellent if they just made it 3 ribs instead of 2 on the combo plate."}
{"text":"Oh dear God, do not spend any money here. My law firm ordered $40 worth of \"BBQ\" from this place today and I cannot believe they sent this out to customers. My \"brisket sandwich\" was 85% PURE FAT and absolutely, disgustingly inedible. They neglected to send the peach cobbler that we ordered and the potato salad was definitely from some Costco store somewhere. Absolutely shameful to expect customers to pay for this cold, gelatinous pile of mess. When I attempted to contact the restaurant, the guy that answered told me to \"take it up with GrubHub\" and then immediately (literally) hung up on me. To the Stacy's manager, this is wretched food and even more wretched customer service. Way to go."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this BBQ joint in a strip center for lunch will have us coming back real soon.  Had a great chopped beef sandwich, generous with the meat on good bread,  with slaw and a side of fried okra.  Meat tender and flavorful, sauce just-right tangy and okra fried crispy!  Wait staff very friendly.  This is a new location so their liquor license in due soon but don't tarry and get in there for some good eats!"}
{"text":"The food here continues to be amazing. Great ribs, pork, chicken and sides (great greens.)
WARNING do not ever order through this great establishment through Grubhub.  Grubhub brings delicious food that is ice cold, soggy by the time Grubhub gets their act together. The same is not true of Ubereats delivery."}
{"text":"My sister in law and I went here for the first time after leaving the state fair. I suggested this place because I drive by it during work and I must say it was a pleasure to get collards and not kale, not the same folks! It's a diamond hiding that must advertised better.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, great food!  Happy they are in the neighborhood, definitely worth a try, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The newly opened Stacy's Pampered Pig is a must visit. I have yet to find a quality BBQ joint in the downtown area but I have not been entirely adventurous in this endeavor. I have had some odd luck with the BBQ places around the downtown area: they're either tucked away on an inconvenient corner or out of food whenever I call to order (right?).

The restaurant is tucked away on the SE corner of 7th AVE and Osborn (in the old Hideaway Lounge spot), it's in the same complex as the perennially average Mexican restaurant: Mi Patio. We came in on a Friday night and the place was empty, completely empty actually. The lighting was bad and the space looked completely unfinished, none of this is relevant though because the food is excellent.

We waited about 45 minutes for our order (call ahead if you're ordering fried chicken) but it was well worth it. 

I suggest the cowboy beans, brisket (I've had better but it was OK), the fried chicken, even the cornbread was fantastic. I hope that this restaurant stays around for a while because they are very good at what they're doing. 

I will definitely return in the near-future."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off day, I went on Saturday with my mom hoping my experience would be as amazing as everyone else. When I arrived I thought oh it's a cute little hole in the wall restaurant. The hostess seen us and seated us down and got our drink. First impressions are important, we sat down and the table wasn't wiped down and it had old plastic table covers and the salt shakers had like grease and BBQ stains on them. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid but sometimes the outside is a representation of what's going on in the kitchen. Okay, whatever, we get our drinks, I get a red kool-aid tastes pretty good but the one thing I couldn't get over was a lingering scent in the restaurant, it was like mildew or something. We get our food, I got the brisket and pulled pork along with mac and cheese with corn bread. You get a good portion for 13 bucks. For some reason when I took the first bite I tasted the lingering mildew scent and the mac and cheese were a little bland. The meat was juicy, l'll give it that but the lingering scent was what to me. Idk If I'm too sensitive but that's what was the downfall to me."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place. I have ordered from here many, many times and have had nothing but great service. Food was really good, on-time, etc. Tonight, I ordered and after 2 hours of waiting found out the Grubhub driver has been sitting there waiting for 90 minutes and continually being told \"it's coming...\" 90 MINUTES!!!  I called directly and spoke to the manager who had nothing to say other than \"what do you want me to do?\" I'm going to stop typing right now because I am incredibly disgusted and angry and don't want to write anything ugly. To Stacy's management directly... please get it together, you have a great product but bad service always outweighs good product."}
{"text":"Terrible! I order food for delivery, my children are vegetarians so I ordered the mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes, also the okra, and green beans with potatoes. I only rescieved one very tirny Mac and cheese, none of the coleslaw, I also ordered. I didn't get the dinner for my kids, I had to order them a pizza. My bill was $71 and the restaurant  was then closed, so they couldn't fix it and they have not reimbursement
 My money. Terrible experience terrible customer service. Very angry and would never order from them again. 71 dollar dinner and got nothing, nothing from them had to spend another 23 bucks to get my kids a pizza. Don't trust them they really messed up and didn't care to fix it. Give them your money if you want but they are not honest people and I. This day and age we need to trust. They stiole my money. Never again. Ever!"}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket dinner with 2 sides. I chose green beans and Mac n cheese. Long story short. It was not very good. The meat was tough and extremely fatty, green beans were severely salty, and the Mac tasted artificial. Nothing looked or tasted fresh. It appeared to have been cooked many hours or days before, because of the mushy consistency. All the food tasted like it was drowned in seasoned salt. The meals are way over priced. The service was terrible. One person waiting tables, taking phones orders, and walk-in orders.  Running back and forth. I won't be back. It was a joke!"}
{"text":"If you are expecting to get good BBQ here forget it!  The owner was extremely rude and the food was horrible!  Absolutely horrible!  I ordered brisket and ribs.  The \"brisket\" ( I use this word lightly) tasted like pot roast and did not resemble anything like brisket.  Honestly, I questioned if it was really brisket as did my friend.  Stacy, go to Little Miss BBQ and learn what REAL brisket is!  Oh and the ribs..if you want to feel like you're eating a piece of jerky, by all means order the ribs.  I had to saw the meat off the bone.  The ribs were extremely dry and seemed as though they were reheated.  Think he forgot to \"pamper\" the pig!  And the BBQ sauce that came with brisket and ribs....tasted like dirty dish water.  Disgusting!  Thankfully, I tasted the BBQ sauce first before putting on my meat.  The potato salad and cowboy beans lacked flavor and seemed extremely amateur.  The owner explained the cowboy beans as \"really Good and have jalapeños\" ...our cowboy beans had one small remnant of a jalapeño.  Entire meal was Completely INEDIBLE!   $65 worth of BBQ I had to throw away and get something else for dinner. Oh, and the dogs wouldn't even eat the brisket or ribs!"}
{"text":"Was up visiting from Atlanta ,Ga was looking for that dive BBQ Joint ...
And I found it in the name of Stacy's Pampered Pig...
I ordered the  pound of brisket, pulled pork , hot links...
Meat was smoked to perfection so tender and juicy ...
and that BBQ Sauce  was such a nice compliment to the meat...
5 Stars all the way...."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Just simple delicious food,  like getting invited to a talented friend's BBQ. Hopefully they'll start having parties soon to match that newly acquired liquor license.  It's a beautiful space and although the Hidden House can never be replaced,  something beautiful can be here again."}
{"text":"I ordered food from them through Grub hub and the food came hot and on time. But they brought me a 3 piece chicken dinner when I order the fish dinner. I called Grub hub who stated the restaurant was sorry and they will credit me back 15.45 to my debit card I have never received that credit yet. To top it off my daughter wanted the Brisket combo we opened the box to Burned bun and all fatty brisket meat and a soggy burned bottom bun. I never received any refund from that. But Stacy's pampered pig.. I will be reporting you to the BBB for shady business. Plus people the Macaroni and cheese was nasty....."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed. The food was OK but very over priced for the amount you got. I know BBQ prices are usually a little high but this place is higher than it should be, especially for a mediocre BBQ place. I'll give it a try again though if they ever get beef ribs in."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok. Not the best 'cue I've ever had. We tried some of everything: pulled pork, beef slices, mac and cheese, fried okra, collard greens, fried green tomatoes, rice w/gravy. There were three of us and we ordered large sides to share but the small would have been enough. Big portions. 
Meat was meh. Sauce a bit boring. Okra and tomatoes were good. Mac was slightly sweet, not the best I've had but not bad. Too much salt in greens. Rice with gravy was not all that flavorful. And they didn't have sweet tea which was annoying. Maybe other people would like this barbecue place but I can't really recommend."}
{"text":"Found this place at random, googled bbq joints near me (Az state fair grounds). This place come up, thought what the heck. Will try anything once.
I was not disappointed, this place is the best Bbq I have had in the 5 years I've lived here. And I have tried a lot of bbq. 
Had fried green tomatoes, corn bread, SPP special (sandwich) and Cole slaw. 
Could taste the wonderful smoke in the meat, it was tender and flavorful. The sauce , on the side, was excellent.
Wish I had room to eat some sweet potato pie for dessert, but was so full.

This is my new Bbq joint."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly & inviting. We were greeted upon entering and sat ourselves.  My friend & I both ordered 2 meat combo plates with mac & cheese as the side.  The brisket, hot links and ribs were delicious and the sauce was excellent. Only reason for four star rating is because the mac and cheese was a bit plain & they were out of collard greens. A good amount of food, I even had left overs."}
{"text":"1:20 on a Tuesday and closed. Passed several other BBQ places on my way across town to get here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome & I love what they have done with the space. The server/owner and I assume cook also said that him and his partner had done all the work, which is pretty amazing considering what it looked like when it was the Hidden House. I had the BBQ chicken and beans as a side. The chicken was super moist and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. Beans were really good too. My husband got the pulled pork, sausage links and mac & cheese (he is a health nut). I tried his mac & cheese and it was so creamy & cheesy. He loved all of it. It's really reasonably priced, I think for both our meals we spent about $20. They didn't have a liquor license yet, but they were working on it. The only downfall was the extra hours we had to spend in the gym, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I just had the pulled pork sandwich. That is the best barbecue I have ever had! Thank you Stacey."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place since I saw they have fried okra. This review is based only on that and the potato salad because its all I tried. The potato salad was the traditional kind with tiny bits of pickle, egg, mayo, and mustard. It was very fresh and tasty.

Now the disappointment. The okra had a cornmeal breading that was actually pretty well seasoned. Unfortunately, even AFTER asking specifically they make it extra crispy, the breading looked identical to what it probably looked liked before it was 'fried' and was falling off the okra. Real fried okra is crispy, appropriately greasy and the breading sticks to the okra. it was also apparently applied with a sledgehammer because I had almost a full takeout box of it left over.

what I don't understand is how they guy did not see the sheer disappointment on my face when he opened the box for me to check it and clearly, was not made to order. if you don't want to do that, just tell me and I will take my business elsewhere. I will wait a few extra minutes no problem if needed. Obviously not much concern for repeat customers. I will add I was the only customer in there so you think the effort would have put forth to make it right."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday quick trip to Phoenix from LA. It was pretty slow, but my food was hot, fresh and tasty. Angel was my server and she even helped me with some places to go sight see. I had the fried catfish, fries and potato salad. Everything was good, the potato salad was a tiny bit bland (sorry). Other than that great establishment!"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with everything we ordered. The pulled pork sandwiches were amazing. You could taste the authentic smokey flavor. The BBQ sauce was on point and they are pretty large sandwiches. I'm pretty picky when it comes to Cole slaw and this has to be one of my favorites. Also, the fried okra was seasoned to perfection. My daughter got the fried shrimp dinner and these had to be the largest shrimp I've seen in AZ. The breading was light and crispy. The cocktail sauce was mixed perfectly. And the Mac n cheese was so good! Oh, and I can't forget the cornbread. It was so sweet and moist it would almost qualify as cake. Everything was so damn good. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Why did I go here?!! Oh right, I was lured by all those yelp stars and didn't take time to look at pics or read the reviews. The brisket was not tender and juicy, I had to work to tear into it with my teeth. Ribs were ok, I prefer it to be more easily detachable from the bone. Mac n cheese was very very meh, I'd rather eat boxed Kraft. Collard greens were good."}
{"text":"Thank the Lord for this fried okra! I always judge BBQ joints by the quality of their pulled pork sandwiches and this one did NOT disappoint! And the SAUCE! Did I mention the fried okra?"}
{"text":"Ordered food last night from Stacy's and had it delivered by Uber Eats. The chicken was still raw, and I order a brisket and I got nothing but slices of fat. This was my first time ordering from Stacy's I heard good things about it but after receiving this I would not recommend their food to anyone."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall that's tough to find but the BBQ is great.  Good spicy southern sauce and a heavy smoke smoke on the ribs.   Excellent little dive."}
{"text":"Love this place! the food was sooo good! especially the all you can eat fish fry on Fridays!"}
{"text":"So here is the skinny. We tried out this place today. It is kind of weird. I guess you seat yourself.  There is no one to really seat you and no sign directing you. We got a menu and sat down. We ordered water to drink since it was very hot outside. We decided on some food and it came out fairly quick. I had the sandwich with a mix of meats. I had to order the side extra, for the prices a side should have come with it. My sandwich with a side was over $14 dollars. My friend ordered a platter which as 2 meats and includes 1 side. It is $13. His meat was very dry and it was two small slices of beef. The chicken was a small pile of chicken. It is all served on a cafeteria tray with plastic silverware. These prices are nicer restaurant prices. We asked for refills on our water and Stacey told us the drinks are self serve but he would get it for us this time. Self serve? For these prices our food should be on plates, with silverware, and we shouldn't have to get up, walk clear across the restaurant and get ourselves a refill. Bottom line, go to Famous Dave's. It will cost you the same and you will get better service and not leave wondering why you paid so much for so little. (Service and food) 
Side note...they should probably cover the wires hanging from the ceiling. The place looks not finished."}
{"text":"I have had some good Barbeque before here in Phoenix, and across the nation, but Stacy's was one of the best Southern meals I've had in a while. The review would have been 5  stars if we didn't receive as much bones in the meat as we did. However, the collard greens and potato salad were excellent, and the barbeque sauce and meat itself were flavorful. I would give this place a try."}
{"text":"Really just nothing nice to say here. I paid for my meal and left it there- no input from me could ever fix all the misses here."}
{"text":"Best Barbecue I've had in a while. The service was impeccable and quick. And the food was even better. I got 3 ribs and 2 sides and the ribs were grilled to perfection and the sauce was vinegar based and delicious. And my sides were great too! I highly recommend this place !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in a centralized area. In a shopping center next to a tattoo shop. Good food, stage for entertainment and they have kool-aid!"}
{"text":"BBQ Good, Sides are good, Service is good. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some good down home cooking. Between my family, we had ribs, brisket, pulled pork, fried shrimp, potato salad, BBQ beans, yams, and greens. Not one complaint. The small sides are not \"tiny\". They are actually eatable portions, and the drinks are large. This is easily one of my favorite BBQ places in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I recently started working in this area and have begun seeking out places to take in a quick, yet tasty, lunch.  Wow, this place hit the mark.

OK, you walk in and you feel like you are in a big BBQ hall.  They are still getting organized and have several picnic style benches and a few tables spread throughout with a big bar in the center.

The pretty and efficient waitress, Shar, takes your order and, if you are eating in, will bring it to your table.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich lunch special and it arrived at my table within 5 minutes of ordering.  It was a very, very generous portion of great tasting pulled pork on a nicely toasted soft bun and a side of BBQ beans, delicious!  The sauce, served on the side, was great!!!!

I had a big glass of tea, free refills, and was out the door for under $12, plus tip, in less than 30 minutes.

Great food at a great price.  It is not a fancy place, but it is a great BBQ joint!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork nachos $10 and mac n cheese $4. The nachos were mediocre, the pulled pork was pretty good. The mac n cheese was nothing special, had a slightly sweet taste which was strange. Mac n cheese should be creamy and cheesy, maybe some black pepper or even baked on top, temperature hot in the middle and call it good. The building itself is half night club half restaurant, prices did seem a lil high. Overall Grade C-"}
{"text":"Yelpers report this restaurant has CLOSED PERMANENTLY. I was going to try it out, but came to Yelp to check reviews first. Glad I did. Saved myself a trip. Hopefully I save you a trip too."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall spot. Pretty empty for a Saturday night, about 25 people in the whole place. With that being said we waited about 35 min for our food. We ordered the rib dinners with 2 sides. Unless they are cooking ribs to order it shouldn't have taken that long. The mac and cheese was basic taste like stoffers. The bbq beans was garbage! Greens and cornbread was ok. They ran out of yams! Which was the #1 thing I wanted. The server wasn't that tentative. The one lady, I'm guessing she was the owner, she had on this lace type of shirt where her boobs was about to pop out and greet ya boy lol just wasn't impressed won't be returning. But go check it out maybe you will have a better experience then I did."}
{"text":"They have some great food! The fry on the catfish and hush puppies is awesome! The only thing is, the pulled pork was a little dry, but still had a nice flavor to it. The bar-b-que sauce is deep and rich, would love to get my hands on that recipe! The staff is also very friendly. They took our large to-go order 10 mins before they were closing, without any complaints. Love, love the staff!!"}
{"text":"Deliciously good. Don't let the curb appeal or lack there of turn you away. The hot links, brisket, and pulled pork were fantastic!"}
{"text":"RUDE customer service (if you can call it that).

Food was not hot and meat was extremely fatty.  Will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this place two weekends in a row. Not only for the amazing food but the customer service is great. Michelle is a breath of fresh air. Her upbeat attitude and contagious smile is very pleasant. She is the definition of great customer service. We've tried every meat that is on the menu and have not been unsatisfied. Highly recommend the pampered pig sandwich. It offers all the meats placed perfectly on a toasted bun with a side of barbecue sauce and is very fulfilling. We will continue to visit this establishment for the good food and great customer service. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be my last, this place is great!  There' no shortage big name fast food chains around but this is good home cooking without much of a wait.  The atmosphere is something to behold, the music is spot on and my server, Scott, was pleasant and paid attention to his customers.  If you haven't been here I would wholeheartedly recommend that you give it a try!"}
{"text":"building is run down and is in a bad hood but I tried the food and had no complaints.  They seem to be getting started so i will try again."}
{"text":"Went there 2 days ago &&' for my first time being there I was very impressed. I like the atmosphere. I had ended up getting the 2 meat combo dinner ( pulled pork and ribs ) &' my friend ended up getting the rib tips . Both plates were very delicious. I been looking for a black BBQ spot since I moved to AZ and this is the spot . Will be coming back and highly recommended this place . 

Only Con : my friend didn't like his coleslaw so if we are paying for a combo dinner that comes with 2 sides he should be able to switch his other side . But the guy who helped us didn't even ask if he wanted another side ."}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounded up to 5.

I can't believe I have not written a review for this place!

I was surprised to learn that there was a BBQ joint situated in the middle of midtown.  This restaurant is located in the shadows of Dignity Health and conveniently across the street from the Safeway at the corner of 7th Ave and Osborne.  The staff here is amazingly friendly and quick.  The restaurant reminds me of BBQ joints back home... Picnic tables with red and white checkered table cloths and No frills, just good food.

I have come here several times.  I have had the BBQ ribs(3.5) and their fried catfish(4) with okra on the All-You-Can-Eat night.  I enjoyed both of those.  But my 5-star review rests primarily on my love of small businesses and their chicken wings.  I love love love hot wings and Stacey's wings are the best in town to me.  You can get an order and put any kind of sauce on them.  I make my own honey hot sauce and use it on their wings.  Their fries are good as well.

They have live music on Friday and Saturday starting at 9.
