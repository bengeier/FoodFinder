{"text":"This was my first experience with Casa Rey's, and my last.  I usually stroll down to the food truck lineup by the Capitol on Fridays just to get out of the office - occasionally to eat if I forget my lunch, which was my misfortune today.  Rey's menu looked alright and was reasonably priced, I thought.

I ordered the Charro Completo specialty burro - advertised on their menu for $6.50 (this detail is important).  I handed the man (if it was Rey, he's an idiot, and if it wasn't, Rey hires idiots - bad news either way) a $20, and he said $7.50.  I asked if there was tax because the menu said $6.50.  He said \"No it doesn't.  My screen [an iPad] says $7.50.\"  I again explained to him that the MENU said $6.50 - I had to turn my head just slightly to confirm.  I invited him out of the truck to take a look for himself.  His silence indicated his refusal of my offer.

Then, he hands me $12.50 in change (again, Rey or his staff member is an idiot).  I have more pressing things to quibble about than $1.  The poor rating has more to do with the mess of a burrito I ultimately choked down (I would compare the quality to Filiberto's but that would be unfair to Filiberto's) than the $1 and utter refusal to even acknowledge a mistake or apologize."}
{"text":"This food is so good! A little spicy depending on the dish. Very fresh and delicious! You should definitely try it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gollo Burrito.... yumm-yumo... Probably going to be craving that burrito again soon.  Staff is awesome and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"We love the pork burritos! It's an obsession. They are simple, a nice size, and spicy. Only wish you offered chips and salsa at your truck!"}
{"text":"Seriously, someone (Pam C) gave Casa Rey's a 2 star review over $1... that's petty.  Stay home an play with your cats!

Casa Reys food is amazing, using old family recipes.  I've had food from their mobile kitchen several times now and it's always been top quality and delicious.  I've also been to their old restaurant in Chandler and one of their families other restaurants Casa Reynoso several times.  Hands down, it's my absolute favorite Mexican food in town, and the salsa is addictive.  

Try a little bit of everything, because it's all amazing.  My only complaint is that that I'd like to see a regular schedule on their website or Facebook page so that I can find them more easily and seek them out."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  Highly recommend the green chili pork.  There is not a bad item on the menu."}
