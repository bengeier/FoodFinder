{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Staff is super friendly and helpful, salads are flavorful and fresh, and the juice is delicious as well. If you love charcoal lemonade, this is by far the best tasting one I have ever tried. Adorable outdoor patio behind Desoto market that you can enjoy with your fur friends too."}
{"text":"Im obsessed! This is my new favorite! The salads are soooo good! I love that after I eat here, I feel really good about what Im putting in my body! The amount is perfect too. I never feel like Im still hungry. All the salads just satisfy you and leave you wanting more. Oh! Try the soup of the day. Ive had a few and they were all delicious! Fruit juices are good. Especially for those scared of trying pressed juices.

THIS IS A MUST when in Downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"big fan of the Kale salad and juices. I make a point to stop here when I'm in the area. Freshest ingredients and great service help them stand apart."}
{"text":"I've been here several times after yoga and haven't tried anything I didn't like. My favorite is the kale-ing me softly salad. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got such good reviews. I went after receiving an email from Yelp recommending this place and I'm sorry I did. It's basically an overpriced food court. I had the Cobb salad and it was definitely one of the worst salads I've ever eaten. Totally flavorless and not satisfying. There wasn't much to it at all-needed more chicken, better greens, maybe some cheese...and the peppercorn ranch it came with was super spicy so I couldn't even use that for flavor. Definitely not worth the price, over $10...I've had a better salad at jack in the box, no kidding. I wouldn't recommend it. I gave it two stars because my husband said his wrap was good. It was $23 for a salad and a wrap, without drinks.  I could've gotten a much better salad....just about anywhere...and probably cheaper."}
{"text":"Salad is better with dressing. I ordered to go and unfortunately, did not check to make sure the dressing was included. The employees were friendly and helpful, but there is nothing more annoying than coming home hungry and finding something is missing."}
{"text":"I went to the Grand Opening today after hearing how wonderful it was from so many friends.  It was clean, friendly and very impressive.  There is nothing on the menu that I will not try.  I can't remember ever saying that about anyplace else.  I suggest you try them.  They support the local farms.  The chefs menu is amazing.  What a great group of people!  I will be making this a new regular.  -CN Phx"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I had the \"hungry like a wolf.\" I specified that I wanted my steak cooked \"medium\" and it was very well done (completely brown - see picture), which was disappointing after seeing so many pictures of perfectly cooked steak on Yelp! They may have been willing to try again, but I don't like wasting food (especially meat).

I was also expecting a more substantial salad - again based on reviews of people touting the size of the small. Overall the salad was lacking in everything: ingredients, flavor (except for the dressing, I could really only taste the overdone steak), and impression. I don't know if I would give them another shot - if I need a last minute \"healthier\" lunch alternative and I'm in the area, I may try again.

I am also surprised by the spike in their prices - if you look at some of the menu pics (from just last year), most of their small salads were $5, some $6 - now they are $8 and $9. I get the fluctuating market, but damn."}
{"text":"I love Radish.  They have a nice selection of healthy salads made with tasty ingredients.  My favorite it the Patagonia."}
{"text":"I had the Gauc This Way salad, and it was amazing.  The vegetables were really fresh.  The soup was very flavorful as well.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The juices and salads are both delicious! I eat at healthy places like this a lot and was really impressed with the 'you spin me' salad. Looking forward to going back and taking friends/family there. You'll really enjoy this spot."}
{"text":"What's good: dressings are made in house and you can taste it, steak on the steak salad was cooked to a perfect pink. $10 for a to go salad might seem high but it is totally worth it. We tried the steak and Mexican salad, both were excellent and left us completely satisfied. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I first saw this place on Postmates and decided to give it a try. I had not been to the DeSoto Market yet and I figured this was a great time to try it. I really appreciated that their salads are meals in of themselves. I had a Guac This Way. The lettuce was green and fresh, the avocado was cut fresh in front of us and the chicken was tasty.  This place does salads right and I'll definitely be coming back for more. I also had the Rad But True juice and it was refreshing. I'm not a huge salad for a meal person, but this place has given me reason to change my mind."}
{"text":"This was amazing. My salad was so fresh and the juices we great. We will be there sooner than later."}
{"text":"I love their South by Southwest salad! The avocado, pico, corn, love all of it! It's a great lunch spot. I ordered the hummus once but I thought it was too bland and thicker than most other hummus sold at other places. The price of the salad is average and it's very filling! Definitely recommend this place :)."}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall place. If you didn't know it was in the market you'd miss it. Food was very fresh and service was great. If you're looking for a good salad this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The Kale Me Maybe juice is so refreshing and healthy! The salads are filling and have great unique flavors. I've tried two of their salads and both were delish! I can't wait to try a third."}
{"text":"The best place in downtown Phoenix to eat healthy delicious salad and healthy delicious wonderful drinks!  Make sure to find it in the DeSoto Marketplace Central and Roosevelt!"}
{"text":"Can someone PLEASE open a Radish in Milwaukee? I come here every time I'm visiting. Aside from having fun punny music names for everything, the food/juice is so healthy and delicious! The Can't Tox This Cold Pressed Juice with activated charcoal 
 and lemon has been a live saver on a Sunday morning. The G.L.O. was super refreshing with it's pineapple, mint, and chlorophyll. The packaging is also super cute & helpful with a description of what all the ingredients are doing to help your body.

My absolute favorite dish to order is the Purple Grain bowl (which I of course try to recreate at home since I love it so much): quinoa, brown rice, organic Tuscan black kale, raw beets, roasted sweet potatoes, sliced almonds, tomatoes, avocado, with a vegan-friendly pomegranate-basil vinaigrette. TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is pretty awesome. They've only been open for less than 1 year and these guys got it down and are pretty cool. Super fresh and they even gave me a military discount after I told them not to because as a new business they need to make as much money as possible. I got the hungry wolf and it really hit the spot and was pretty awesome. Would definitely come back here as a regular customer. If you live/work in the area, you should do this, make this place one of your regulars."}
{"text":"This business appears to be temporarily closed. The Tea shop in Desoto Market said Radish was \"in transition\" but they carried some in of their juices. 

It was a very hot 98 degree day and I circled the block on foot after parking - so I would like to save another yelper the trouble.  Maybe you can order ahead but at the moment you cant walk in."}
{"text":"I am VERY spoiled when it comes to salads-I eat them all the time and make my own homemade dressings. Radish did not disappoint! The salads were delicious, unique, and a satisfying meal! And the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is what PHX needs! Top to bottom well thought out and exexuted well.  We need more healthy options out there with real food.  It's also has a cool industrial yet elegant look to it. It's worth the trip downtown for me. Staff is super cool. I walk in hungry and walk out feeling good. Always take an extra juice to go. Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the excitement over this place is. The salads are overpriced and extremely basic. I wanted a smoothie but they were out of every single ingredient in it so all that was available were juice options. If you need a basic salad this place gets the job done but isn't anything special."}
{"text":"So I enjoyed the salad and it satiated my hunger, however for $13 I would have expected better ingredients (lettuce had some browning on it) and avocado was not fully ripe. Then to be asked about a tip when there is no service given... 

I doubt I will return but the deviled eggs they had were delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to Radish a few times now. Everything is fantastic! Service, fresh delicious food, reasonable prices. Highly recommend the Kale Me Softly."}
{"text":"Pretty good salad. I liked the portion size and the overall atmosphere of the market. I got the El Mariachi and ordered the dressing on the side. It was spicy and exactly what I wanted it to be. Radish was quick, healthy, and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is totally my kind of place, and I'm so excited to have it so close to my house!

I'm a self-proclaimed \"salad connoisseur\". Salad is one of my favorite foods if it's done well -- as in fresh, quality ingredients in interesting, flavorful combinations. I'm thrilled that Radish gets it right!

Every one of the salads on their menu sounds really tasty. All their unique dressings are fresh and house-made, making them delicious and healthy (the staff said they are all made with olive oil! Health nuts can rejoice that there is no soybean oil or other cheap vegetable oil). Chef Quentin also told me that about 90% of their ingredients are locally sourced, and many of them are organic. Just what I'm looking for in a restaurant salad. Win!

I ended up getting the Beard of Zeus salad: Romaine, grilled chicken, feta cheese, kalamata olives, braised artichoke hearts, garbanzo beans, grilled zucchini, tomato, cucumber, red onion, mint, and a creamy roasted garlic dressing. It all had such good flavor to it, and just the right balance of everything. The mint and the garlic really stood out to me, and I loved it! The regular size salad was plenty. I even had leftovers to take home.

The customer service was great as well, and Chef Quentin seemed very passionate and excited about this new restaurant. He was very helpful, informative and kind. 

I will definitely be back. I think this will be a go-to spot for my salad fix. The juices all looked and sounded so good -- especially the \"Rad But True\" (watermelon, cucumber and mint! Yum!). I can't wait to try some of these in the future!"}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere definitely want to go back and try again. There was one person working at 1130a on a Monday when we arrived there was no one else there. The line grew after we arrived. My salad took 25 min to get and then the order was not correct which is why I am giving 3 stars. It was tasty and fresh... maybe because the vegetables had to be picked?"}
{"text":"I order Radish salads and juices atleast once a week and they are always fresh ! Great option for a lighter/helathier meal. It's also a super close walk from downtown as well as an option on UberEats ! Love their can't toxic juice."}
{"text":"Super fresh and delicious! I love the South by Southwest salad and Rad But True Juice!"}
{"text":"I was downtown with friends and we stopped into De Soto Market for some grub. I was craving something healthy so naturally stopped by Radish to see what they had to offer. I went with their spin on a Greek Salad called the Beard of Zeus and it was SO tasty! They did not skimp on the toppings and the salad was to fresh and filling. It was packed with feta cheese, olives, artichoke hearts {YES!}, garbanzo beans, grilled zucchini, tomato, red onions, cucumber, and more. Can you say packed with goodness?! My biggest pet peeve is when salads are light on the toppings and it happens frequently with Greek salads but NOT at Radish! I also loved the creamy roasted garlic dressing. They have a great variety of juices as well - i'll be back the next time i'm in the area! :)"}
{"text":"Oh man this place is good!  I was out in Phoenix for the week on vacation.  What does one do on vacation?  Eat, eat and eat some more.  It's usually nothing healthy of course.  About the third day of nothing but craft burgers and tacos, I felt the need for greens.  What I received that day from the rad folks of Radish were no ordinary greens.  I went in hungry like the wolf so to accommodate this I ordered their Hungry like the Wolf salad.  How could one go wrong with humanely treated grilled steak, locally sourced blue cheese crumbles, herb roasted potatoes and cherry tomatoes over mixed arugula topped with a housemade balsamic?  Oh, don't let me forget the golden ticket of this salad.  CARAMELIZED ONIONS!!!  Makes you wanna step back and kiss yourself...or the dude that made the salad.  In this case I kissed myself cause I was happy to be on vacation!  I grabbed a couple of cold pressed drinks for the road and spread them out over the next couple of days to offset some vices.  You know.  Cause when on vaca you eat, eat, eat some more and oh yeah...drink!

I can't wait to get out there again this Christmas and do it all over again!  Next visit I'm getting the South by Southwest cause it only makes sense as a Austinite!  Can't wait!

*ate too fast to take photos"}
{"text":"I haven't been into the restaurant BUT if its as great as the juices that I had bought from the farmer's market then I just cannot wait to experience the food!  

I have kinda had a horrible juice weekend (I was juicing for 3 days) and was not all that excited to try anything with the colour green but when I finally gave in, it had reminded me of all of the wonderful things that life can bring me.  Delicious and so easy to drink...honestly, I could drink the first one half way and then want to save the rest for the rest of the day (its just that yummy)! They made me into a believer again with juicing!  Thank you Radish for restoring my faith in juicing but more so for making them so wonderful! I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Radish has been catering lunch at my office about once a week! Their salads are very unique, fresh and delicious.

Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to eat clean and feel lean!

Opa!"}
{"text":"After a late start to my day, and in need of a late lunch, I decided to check out Radish at DeSoto Market. I must say, so so so delicious. The people who worked at Radish were so friendly and helped me pick just the right option. I chose the Grilled Salmon and Multi Grain bowl, which was light, fresh, and healthy... just what I needed! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Gave it another try. Had \"Berry Manilow\".....it was so so good. Good fresh filling salad. Thanks Radish! Service was friendly & quality."}
{"text":"Of all the new restaurant concepts introduced thus far at Downtown Phoenix's new DeSoto Central Market, this is by far my favorite to date.  Say hello to Radish, a new fast casual salad and juice spot serving up fresh (and in many cases organic) ingredients sourced from local and regional family farms.  While no one can accuse Radish for being original with this concept, they're certainly perpetuating it in delicious fashion.

I came here Sunday at lunchtime, just a day after their grand opening.  There was a line about 8 deep when I came.  Clearly the buzz is still going strong here.  The first thing you notice as you approach the Radish space is the sign at the counter which changes color every few seconds.  You also notice the colorful baskets of fruits and veggies stacked behind the counter for all to see.  The salad bar itself is setup not unlike your local Chipotle, though you won't find any burritos here.  Here its all about the salads.  Their menu contains a list of house creations you can choose from or you can customize them yourself.  The customization system will look familiar to patrons of Sam Fox's Flower Child concept as the systems are quite similar (though Radish's prices are decidedly cheaper).  To the side of the salad bar is the house made juices which run the fruit and vegetable gambit.

For my first time here, I went with a full size order of their South By Southwest salad (they also have half sizes of their salads for about half the price).  For a drink I went with their Just Beet It juice.  Total cost for everything including tax was about $17.  They constructed the salad from scratch right in front of me and served it to me in about a minute.  Even though the salad I got was $10, the full size salads are huge.  For most, a half salad would be more than sufficient.  The South by Southwest was highlighted as their signature salad on their menu and for good reason.  Its fantastic.  Mixed greens, chicken, avocado, salsa, black beans, cilantro, pickled jalapeño, queso fresco, pico de gallo, tortilla chips, and a honey lime vinaigrette dressing.  The rainbow of ingredients works together perfectly and tasted as fresh as you would expect with a farm to table concept.  It was a huge salad so I was full when I was finished, but every bite was incredibly satisfying.  To watch it all down, the Just Beet It juice includes beets (obviously), pineapple, carrot, and lemon.  Thankfully no pulp, though its not a smoothie either.  The flavors are very subtle but clean and you certainly get the feeling that you're drinking something pretty healthy.  I would almost compare it to a V8 Splash, but without the added sugars.

I have no doubt that this will be the most popular of all the new restaurant concepts to debut at DeSoto and with good reason.  The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable, and the fast casual healthy angle has broad appeal (particularly amongst Downtown patrons).  Even though this place just opened, they've clearly already gained a following and I look forward to sampling many more of their salad creations.  I'll just cross my fingers and hope the line won't get any longer."}
{"text":"So delicious and nutritious!!! Perfect food ! I got the beet smoothie and added strawberries and it's so delicious! Better than fake Jamba Juice Haha .  the customer service was sooo great ! The man that Attended me was so helpful .ill definetley be back again !"}
{"text":"Located inside the De Soto Market...it's in the corner on the ground level.
I am not even healthy and I love their cold pressed juices!
Spicy Watermelon Jalapeno was great when they had it.
I could just drink it to drink it and if it does my body good...even better!
Just tried their Kale Me Maybe and Feel the Bern.  I dont like Kale to eat but this was the best tasting Kale drink I have tried.
Feel the bern was delicious! Agave Nectar, cayenne pepper and all kinds of goodness.
$8 and change per bottle...but i really like it.
They sell a little cheaper at the farmers market on saturdays.
I probably need to try out their 2 or 3 day cleanse as I have always wanted to do so!
Pretty sure they use all locally sourced products and I just love their concept and flavors!"}
{"text":"Radish is great.  

Perfect stop in for First Friday. Ample parking and bike racks. Dog friendly patio. Awesome concept. My second time in two weeks!

I wish I worked downtown so I could grab a cold pressed juice every morning or a salad for lunch. This place is so good.  I could drink the cilantro lime salad dressing. Awesome staff too!

This is a must try"}
{"text":"What an amazing salad - spinach, strawberries, goat cheese, onions and candied pecans!  I can't believe I haven't been here before a few weeks ago, but will definitely be back when I am craving a great salad.  Friendly staff, quick service and high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The salads here are great, but I'm not sure I will be back after 3 bad experiences.  I work downtown, and the last three times I have ordered online, I get to the restaurant, and they haven't even checked their online order system.  This time I even tried calling to confirm, and you get sent to voicemail directly with no way to contact the restaurant.  Of course I left a message, but nobody seems to check that either.

In this day and age of so many people calling in orders or ordering takeout, you should have a way to contact the place."}
{"text":"I'm in love. Everything I've had at Radish has been wonderful....the salads Kale-ing Me Softly, Hungry Like the Wolf...the juices Kale Me Softly, Chloro-feeling Good....and the best hummus and pita in town. They are always so happy and friendly too. This place is fantastic. Love the food and the people there."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a great fruit smoothie and decided to try Radish. I got the Kale Me Maybe smoothie, the cashier suggested I add strawberries free of charge, which I did. OH MY KALE, it was SO delicious and filling (32oz). I felt great afterwords. It is definitely worth the price! 

Update: tried the south by southwest salad and I wish I could add 5 more stars! Yummy."}
{"text":"I asked the worker to split my large salad in two containers so I could have half now and half later. She said ok but as i was eating one I noticed she forgot 3 of the toppings. I took the opened and unopened one back to her to let her know and she argued with me about what she did or didn't forget even though I was showing her the salads. She did end up apologizing and adding the missing toppings but mentioned a few times that she DID add the artichoke but it all ended up in the other half as if that should have been enough for me... soooo why would I want just one half to have all the toppings while the other half was plain and bland??

Also the avocado they charge extra for is a joke. They don't even give you the full half, they give you about 3/4 of half of it! Come on just give your paying customers the full HALF of the avocado, jeez. Not impressed this time at all :("}
{"text":"Awesome salad spot! Fresh ingredients, large portions, affordable, and you can grab a beer in the open market!"}
{"text":"Chimi churri Salad was AWESOME. Steak was tender and well flavored, veggies were great, fantastic salad."}
{"text":"I LOVE Radish!! Their food is SO yummy, healthy, and prepped so well. The whole concept of Radish is awesome and needed for the area. The staff was super friendly and answered all my questions without seeming annoyed. I will be a frequent customer of Radish and hope they expand to more locations."}
{"text":"I order Radish through postmastes relatively frequently. It's great to have an affordable option when I want a quick healthy lunch delivered. I've had a few of the salads, the kale-ing me softly, the guac this way, and most recently the south by southwest (I love avocado). When I order a salad from other places, I usually end up with a bunch of iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing that I throw out. Not here though. The end of my salad is always just as rich in chicken, veggies and substantial greens as it is at the beginning. Every dressing I've had has been very light and served on the side so I can decide how much I want. 

The juices are intense. Like having another meal. They are full of veggies and nutrients, and taste pretty good for the most part. 

My favorite part about Radish is that I always feel great after  eating their food. Like completely satiated and full of energy great."}
{"text":"We love Radish! If you want a healthy and still great tasting meal this is the place to go. I especially enjoyed the dressing on the salad and the fresh corn and avocado. The location is also perfect and the staff is very friendly. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Love all of the names of the salads very Pun-ny. The portion of the small is perfect for one person. The Service was fast and very lively environment"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh-mazing & soooo fresh. My first time and I loved it! Highly recommend.

I ordered the south by southwest salad, every ingredient in my salad was crisp & flavorful. I had the watermelon, cucumber & mint juice. My belly was happy :)"}
{"text":"I really liked the fresh kale salad. And they have own fresh juice that they making which is good for people that juicing and can't find when u traveling"}
{"text":"Very Nice. I dined at Radish during thier grand opening this weekend. The marketplace in which they are housed was very modern and inviting.  I could see myself hangout out here with friends getting a bite to eat or enjoying some coffee and conversation. Radish offers salads, cold press juices, and hummus plates. I sampled all their juices and they were all great. My favorite was Kale Me Maybe, which was bottled and ready to go. I didnt have the opportunity to try one of the many salads however I did notice thier substantial size. They would definitely fill you up. I will be stopping by next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Really good combo of salads. They also have juices which are delcious. And also try their protein smoothies which are large and enough to substitute as a on the go lunch. The staff is super friendly and will answer any questions. Plus you can substitute any item in your salad for another. 
The place can be hard to find as it is in a small warehouse like building with bunch of other restaurants. Also parking can be an issue sometimes.
It's easier to order through the ubereats app. I have code that can be used for discount  $10: eats-mbdvx."}
{"text":"Disappointed that even a salad for here is served in a plastic togo container. Radish needs to move to more sustainable packaging and plates for customers staying to eat. Then maybe it wouldn't feel like such an average grab-and-go grocery store salad. Overpriced and not amazing at all."}
{"text":"A little hard to find because it's in like a food court. Once I asked and was told that Radish was around the corner inside it was good.  I got the Barry Manilow salad which had lettuce, strawberries, blue cheese chunks, walnuts, red onion, bacon and was delish! My friend had the Southwest salad which had a ton of stuff. She thought it was really good.  They had self serve water available which was nice.  They could have had more tables and chairs."}
{"text":"This place is in DE Soto market. Great set up where you have options of different little eateries to choose from. I had a small the guac this way salad that a lot of people have tried with queso fresco. It was a good size. The meat is tasty and of high quality. The veggies are all fresh and local. The price is average for me. I've been to a lot of organic/health juice and salad bars and don't think the pricing is out of norm or overly priced. Small salad was $7 and it was filling being a girl, even though it may not look like it. The food was definitely tasty and I would come back. Great healthy option for lunch. Tastes good, food is energizing, and properly portioned."}
{"text":"If you are a salad connoisseur, this will not disappoint! Quality, fresh, local ingredients. Top of the line salad! They also have amazing fresh cold press juices with really neat names like \"kale me maybe\" which is a combination of Kale, ginger and lots of other yummy fruits and vegetables!"}
{"text":"The drink selection is good and I mostly stick to the salads when I'm here. The waits were not too long for the food regardless of how busy they were , so kudos to the staff for hustling like no tomorrow. 

Is nice when the weather outside isn't oppressive. The patio is dog friendly so bring your puppers cuz they need some love too :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wanted to like this place.  The quinoa bowl I had was very good, but tiny.  And cost $12.  I also tired a smoothie, which was really big but a bit short on flavor and texture.  Overall, I was disappointed.  I think if everything would have come out to around $12, I was have said OK, not too bad.  But those two items mentioned above cost me almost $20.  Even in San Francisco, where the cost of living is extraordinarily high, you can find better deals on salads and smoothies."}
{"text":"Nothing says \"I'm an adult\" more than ordering a salad on a Friday night and actually enjoying it. 

I went for the Kale-ing me Softly salad which has kale (surprise!), sweet potatoes, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, cucumbers and a lemon dressing. I got the small but it was still plenty big for me. And I don't say that because I'm some waif who eats like one cookie and says I'm full. (because I am not) It really is a decent portion. 

Anyway...the salad was really yummy and satisfying. The ingredients were fresh, the dressing had a nice flavor and worked well on this salad. I actually liked the salad so much I was inspired to make my own version at home the next week. 

So if you're looking for a healthy meal, Radish is a great option."}
{"text":"So so good! The salads are so fresh and delicious. Love going here & it is just a plus that it is in Desoto central market. Such a great place to hang out and study."}
{"text":"My new lunch obsession. So fresh, great flavors, and online ordering is always a plus. I was craving the Southwest Salad when I was hungover, that's how I know I really loved it. I'll be working across the street soon so I can't wait to be closer! =)"}
{"text":"It is great to support the local businesses. I thoroughly enjoyed their \"Jamaican Me\" salad and their drinks are amazing. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place, they made salads with REAL ingrediants.  

The place is somewhat hidden inside a larger building and cost more because it in a artsy indie area.  This isn't a bad place for a salad and there is bar nearby.  If you want trendy this would be a great option."}
{"text":"First time trying Radish, love the wide variety of selections and the price is pretty decent for the amount! The look of the little shop was very aesthetically pleasing and the food looked great. As a salad lover, I'm always looking for places that do great salads!"}
{"text":"We tried their Kale-ing Me Softly salad. It was delicious despite their being out of kale (they substituted spinach). The lemon tahini dressing up was thick and paired perfectly. We liked the sweet potatoes, although the dice was so small it was almost as if they had been partially mashed. We would have enjoyed larger pieces. The avocado was ripe, and they didn't skimp on the serving size."}
{"text":"I had the straight outta cobbton salad and it was delicious! It was exactly what I was craving. The ingredients were very fresh and the serving size was big. The staff was very friendly and quick as well! I will definitely come back and try other items on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Had an incredibly flavorful quinoa salad...and saw a million other things I would have loved to try. Decided to go here as we have some similar \"gourmet food cart/court\" places in Denver, and it was super fun! Loved the atmosphere and especially loved the patio seating area."}
{"text":"Love the salads here! They're always so big and full of delicious toppings. Lots of options to choose from. Quickly became my salad place of choice. Staff has always been really friendly! I tried a couple of the juices they have to offer, the chocolate one is my favorite. Check out the Groupon they have going on for a really good deal!"}
{"text":"Had a great smoothie for lunch at this spot last week....the portion size was enormous & it was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Super delicious. I got the South by Southwest based on the reviews here and it's delicious. Clean, fresh, but still quick- this is a great lunch time stop."}
{"text":"Looking for a \"light\" meal? Radish is definitely the way to go.

I went with their popular South by Southwest salad which goes a long way, but definitely not the best salad I've ever had. It has avocado, pico de gallo, queso fresco, corn, grilled chicken, black beans, jalapenos and tortilla strips on a bed of their green mix with honey-lime dressing on the side. Small size is a decently sized portion. The salad to me was just okay, it was pretty clean but found the dressing did not suit the ingredients. I was not a fan of it or the tortilla strips, it made the Southwest theme a bit too commercial and gimmicky. It was filling however and I did eat the whole thing.

The only con about Radish is the price point. I understand buying pressed juices for $11 and frozen yogurt for $5 a cup but nearly $10 for a salad is a bit much. Plus, it wasn't amazing just okay. I believe that because of the price point made me want to finish the salad in the end. Would recommend other salad places like Mad Greens for a more well put together salad or at least a salad bar to get more bang for your buck. Would be interested in trying their juices, however."}
{"text":"Stopped by inside of DeSoto Central Market for some juice...the inside is essentially a trendy food court but in a factory like setting with good sitting areas...the kale me maybe was really refreshing and tasty!! Loved it actually!! Went back for second one!!"}
{"text":"This is a great stop for fresh and flavorful salads.  Plenty of choices without overwhelming. Portions are generous without being wasteful. The prices are competitive. And the best part, the service is friendly and helpful. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Got the southwest salad with shrimp and it was delicious! The shrimp was cooked perfectly. It is kind of expensive for the portions but the ingredients are very fresh. I was happy and satisfied with my order! Also the workers are very kind and made me feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Best salads on the west coast, hands down. I actually went in last night and had a groupon for 2 salads and 2 juices but it was expired. The owner happened to be there and decided to honor it anyways. He was a very cool and nice guy. The salads are amazing! I got the guac this way and my bf got the beard of zeus. We both really enjoyed them and were full afterwards. Will definitely be making many trips back here.. I just wish they would open another location in Old Town/South Scottsdale so I didn't have to go all the way downtown every time I wanted one!!"}
{"text":"My office got Rad to cater our lunch today and I am so happy about it! We had the chicken salads and it was DELISHHHHH. The salsa/sauce that came with it was perfect with the chicken and avocado and beans and corn. The salad was also a huge portion. 

As a juice virgin, I tried the 50 shades of green. Definitely veggie-tasting but refreshing! I'm glad I could try this one and sample the kale me maybe. 

Will return on my own! :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhh. Every restaurant has a season and sadly, Radish's is already over. I was a fan of Radish but now I will be avoiding it like the plague. Gross. I went there Tuesday at 2 and ordered a salad. The woman pulled out handfuls of slimy brown Romain and proceeded to stuff the bowl with this gross stuff. As I stared in horror, she plucked out the very brownest pieces and tried to rearrange the lettuce in the bowl to hide the other slimers!  I pointed this out to her and she said they were getting better lettuce in a while but then proceeded to make the rest of the salad!  If that's their attitude then I'm not interested. What other corners do they cut?  I left without getting my brown slimy salad."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with Radish. They have a great looking menu with many interesting salads. I went opening day and the service was spot on as if they had been there months. I ordered the south by southwest salad on staff recommendation, and was impressed with the quality and freshness of the ingredients. The chicken was smoky and tasty, the cheese complimented it nicely.... and... oh ya, there were vegetables. The dressing was also very tasty. I also had their kale juice, which I thought might be a little gross, but it was surprisingly tasty! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband got the Beard of Zeus salad to go for us both. I'm not typically a fan of Greek salads, but this one was pretty delicious. Only downside was that the artichokes were pretty rough and crunchy. Other than that, I'd say I'll likely return. Menu looks great!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. If they could find a way to be consistent with the quality of produce and freshness, I would certainly rate them higher. Also, I had a \"smoothie\" here once that was basically just one of their juices blended with banana and spinach and it gave me the worst stomach ache."}
{"text":"Super yummy AND healthy!! Be RAD and eat at Radish! :D

I love all of their options and fresh, colorful ingredients.Such clever, fun names too! I hear the employees have part in naming their dishes - so cool!

Glory and Erik are amazing and so helpful!! Glory made my salad to perfection and served it with the best smile! 

I ordered the vegan/gluten free salad, Gnarles Parsley. Such a good choice and clever name. All the ingredients blended so nicely together. And for the small order, it was still a lot of food!

I can't wait to go back and try their juices!! Keep being awesome, Radish!"}
{"text":"So excited about this place! Went here for the first time and tried the Beard of Zues salad and the Patagonia salad. They were both so fresh and yummy!! Also tried a few of the juices, Kale Me Maybe and Carrot E-Kid. So good and clever names to boot!

Its awesome to have new healthy and fresh option downtown!.Will be eating here often!"}
{"text":"Very excited to see the renovated building housing such nice places to eat such as Radish! The employees were all nice and welcoming and the service was excellent. I ordered the Hungry Like the Wolf salad and it was great! There's a lot of other good-looking things on the menu and will be coming back soon to sample more. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The salads here are amazing. My personal favorite is the hungry like a wolf. One of the only salads to actually fill me up and taste good. I will definitely being going back soon."}
{"text":"good salad but this need to be better with the portions, not sure i will go back but the peppercorn ranch was pretty good."}
