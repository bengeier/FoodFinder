{"text":"where is the meat? reading reviews and was told they were generous in the portions.  I guess I failed to read the reviews in full... I think they were talking about everything else except the meat.

I ordered the chicken kabob pita and still looking for the chicken.  don't get me wrong, everything was pretty fresh, clean and it was tasty.  even though they cooked the chicken fresh, I need a bit more meat.  the size of the pita and amount of veggies were not really in proportion.   they use the really big size pita breads for their sandwiches and they do stuff it with lots of veggies.  to give you a visual, just imagine a piece  of tissue you get at Mcdonald, open it up and place a toothpick in the  middle, voil√† there is the size of the chicken you get.

price wise, not that bad.  pita and pop only $4.99 + tax

will I come back... hard to say.  I saw other really good things on the menu and was tempted by it.  if i do come back, I will make a mental note to order more meat on the size."}
{"text":"This time I go with my wife.  I order the Vairi Kebob (Vairi might spell wrong) which is one bbq chicken Kebob and Koobideh Kebob ($11.99).  The Koobideh Kebob is same as last time, but what I love is the chicken which is so tender.  Also, the chicken is fresh with the charcoal smell and taste.  

Also, I get the Iranian tea.  The tea smells so good which you can smell from around 2 feet away.  I drink with the Iranian way (put the sugar between my teeth and drink a sap) and my wife said it is too sweet but I think it is just right."}
{"text":"Generous portions for the price and everything is freshly grilled so it feels great especially now that it's getting colder! I got the koobideh kebab and that came with an option of soup or salad, I went with the lentil soup.  Everything I ordered was wonderful and flavourful, the restaurant is so clean and comfortable I'll definitely find a chance to eat there instead of getting take out. There's plenty of space too so I'm sure it'd be a good place to go even with larger groups. I'm looking forward to trying out other items in their menu!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place after seeing it many times and passing by it while getting groceries.  The food here was fantastic, everything was made to order, and it was the first time for us to try Persian/Iranian food.  The rice in particular was something different for us, but we loved it!  We had Koobideh, Barg, and the eggplant stew which I cannot remember the name of.  All were very tasty.  Will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Our favourite Persian food pick up in the GTA.

Great prices, fresh food and generous portions. We've ordered everything from the koobideh, barg, chicken leg and ghormieh sabzi. Everything is always tasty, fresh and cooked perfectly. The restaurant is clean with a steady steam of people picking up food with a few people dining in.

Ive tried lots of Persian places for pick up and this is my new go to because it encompasses everything that I expect if I were to sit down in Persian restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered for take out, got the vaziri with chicken breast and soltani.  The dishes were quite large; ate one saved one for later. The meat was seasoned quite well and they even give you what I assume are paprika packets for some extra flavour. Overall would recommend getting the koonideh Kebob as the price is fantastic for what you get."}
{"text":"I have ordered several times and the food has been consistently amazing. I suggest their ground beef kebab (koobideh)."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian kebab places I've tried! They serve a lentil soup with the meals and it's delicious! The meat is very good quality and always very juicy! Our go to place whenever we aren't in the mood to cook! Best part, very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"I usually like to order from here... Their food was always good. But tonight my husband found a clean cut finger nail in the salad as he was chewing!!!!!! Omg! We were so grossed out and called. The man apologized and said he would give us free salad next time... but do you think I would ever eat the salad again..."}
{"text":"Make sure you know how much your bill will be , otherwise they will rip you off .... The owners are not honest ."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem.  We ordered takeout for 2 parties recently from this restaurant.  Received lots of compliments and were asked where the food was from.  

Food: 
Large portions and tasted great.  We ordered the party packages with chicken leg skewers, koobideh skewers (lamb) and ghaimeh.  The koobideh was expecially popular.  Taste and texture was good.  Most people were indifferent about the ghaimeh.  People thought it looked like meatballs but when they bit into it, it was a preserved lemon so that was surprising for them."}
{"text":"Hi never had this food before.  Extremely tasty lots of flavor.  The lenta soup was great and the beef kabob was very good.  The gents working there were very help ful.  All in all a great meal. I'll be back.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today at noon, and it wasn't too busy which is good because they can focus and take the time to make your food. Kabobs were amazing as always... Barley soup was fantastic... Rice, top notch!"}
{"text":"The Kebob is tasty and tender.
EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE if a few people in line.  
The barley soup that comes with the kebob is tasteless.
Staff are very unorganized and have no system in place.  
Be prepared to wait for your food for at least 45 minutes.
Good price."}
{"text":"yummy.  koobideh Kebob is my favorite.  I always add an extra skewer to my combo.   I come here all the times and food is fresh and dslcious for rrasinavle price. my only complain is they always forget the crispy rice on take outs. .. I never realized until I get home ~___~"}
{"text":"Heard its a good place and tried it on Wednesday. Staff were a little slow but that was ok with me. We had kebab and it was okay but ghorme sabzi tasted, smelled and even looked different (it was a different color! Very strange) we asked them to change it to gheyme and again same thing!!! We had some aash reshte as well and SAME THING! I told someone behind the cash about it and she was trying to give us none sense excuses like I've never had or cooked persian food!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday,

First time here and I am not impressed.
 Based on the reviews  I thought the food would be good. 
I walked into the restaurant, waited for some service took awhile for them to notice me since they were too busy talking to a friend. 

Finally, I had to yell my order for them to hear me. 

I decided to eat in,  they brought me some salad to the table. It was dressed with vinegar ,the salad didn't taste fresh.   

Then came my chicken leg kabob I ordered. 
It was gross. I had a stomach ache and the chicken tasted like soap as if they washed the chicken with soap. The rice was soggy. The tomato tasted like mildew.  

I also ordered lamb shank , but they brought me koobideh instead.  They didn't seem to happy when I told them they got the order wrong.  We ended up eating the koobideh anyway. It tasted okay, mediocre at best.  Rice was also soggy and the tomato tasted old. 
 
Probably will never  be coming back. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"the koobideh and chicken breast kebobs are the best I've ever tasted!! perfectly marinated, juicy and tender morsels of meat. fluffy saffron rice and roast tomatoes on the side. get the family package 1 to go and you will make your party of friends very happy :)"}
{"text":"the owner is a crook.  keep an eye on the price as he will try to scam you through your credit card by adding crazy tip.  food has no taste with much of tasteless white rice.  i am never coming back to this fraud restaurant."}
{"text":"This one came from my heart that I had to give a non stellar review.  First of all they didn't treat me with the same friendliness as other Persian places in fact there was a man who stared at me a couple of times but didn't smile or say anything while working at the back prepping the food.  I didnt think too much about it and proceeded to place an order after a family of 4 placed their order and took their time in doing so!  Still annoyed but I decided with a deep breath and managed to get the attention of the lady who was taking the orders.  I said to her 2 vaziris and she said okay what kind of soup do you want? I ordered one of each the lentil and barley soup as each meal comes with a choice of SALAD or soup but it was too late because she for some reason didn't mention the salad but instead gave me choices for soup.  That went over my head until I sat down and heard her say salad or soup was the side choices to another customer in line.  Annoyed again I decided to have my ice cream from Baskin Robbins that I picked up just before coming by.  Thank God for the ice cream it made the time pass which was 10 minute wait.  Not to mention everyone was staring at me and for the first time I actually felt out of place at a Persian restaurant and I started to question why I thought of coming by that day.  Still anticipation for the food I was hopeful.  Eventually picked up my order and paid I left saying wow the bag is big and heavy I hope it will tastes amazing.  When I got home and opened up the first box I was staring at A LOT of polo aka saffron infused basmati rice.. And the standard skewer of koobideh and juje kabab.  There was a quarter of a  tomato? Since when?? other places I've been going to for years always gives me a whole bbq tomato! On top of that the quarter tomato was barely over the flames 
Now came the part when my heart sank was when I had my first taste of the food.  It was simply the most awkward moment for me because for the first time I said to myself wow where is all the flavour???!!!! Seriously the food was ok quality and portion was Not so bad however it was so incredibly tasteless that I was shocked. The soup was worst with zero flavour and weird gelly texture. I am stunned the quality and flavour both was heavily lacking.  Will not be returning any time soon.  I told my dad I was sorry for grabbing take out from this place for our meals.  Yonge and Steeles or Finch areas offer fantastic take out and I will be coming by soon!"}
{"text":"Making this review while I'm trying the food. Never tried Persian food before. So. Here goes. 
Ordered the soltani kebob. (sirlon and beef mix with lamb) with lentil soup.  Plus for drinks, I tried the yogurt drink. 

Soup. Not a full bowl but is hearty.  A little bland for my taste though. 

Yogurt drink. Is made with yogurt, salt, 
pepper and diced mint.  Interesting taste....
Minty and a little sour (NOT the spoiled taste.  It's from the mint) going down.... This is made in house everyday.  

Now for the main meal.  
Soltani. 1 skewer of Sirlon. Very tender and nicely spiced. (Real meat,Not minced). Lol
The other, minced beef and lamb mix. It's pretty good and nicely spiced too.  
Balsamic rice, cooked good with little oil. Bonus was they also give a piece of rice pot sticker with the meal.  It's the bottom rice that is cooked that turns out crispy. Very interesting also but was pretty good. Lol. 

Overall, it's ok but, WOW, was that a new experience for me. Hahahha."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want to be heckled and harassed by the patrons as you try to pick up your order. The place is poorly organized, and the patrons decide to make up their own social rules of the ordering process. In the end, I didn't get to eat here since I didn't want to give my money to a place that can't put order to the people that heckle other customers."}
{"text":"What's not to love! I grew up eating this food, so i can honestly say the quality of the food is great and tastes really good! Meat is tender and seasoned well, chicken is juicy and seasoned right, rice is cooked well and not too buttery/oily. Owner is nice & friendly and - BONUS - they cater!!"}
{"text":"Round 2 for me and my friends after our first round of Afghan food.

Ordered various skewers for takeout and received naan and a grilled tomato for free. Thank you!

Meat was nicely marinated and quite tasty. Slight downside was it was kind of pricey... And we were told they didn't sell salad on the side.

It seems like they make good business as there were quite a few takeout orders at 9pm. We may come back again for a full meal next time."}
{"text":"I come here almost on a weekly basis and usually get the Koobideh or Chicken Leg kebab. Usually I get it with salad and pita (no rice). 

The chicken leg is usually quite moist and tasty, although it does vary from time to time (I've had it a little under done, and a little overcooked). The Koobideh I've had much less (maybe 1 out of 10 times) but generally of good quality. 

I'm not an expert on kebabs, but I enjoy it and it's fairly cheap (less than $15 after taxes and tip). 

Note that the service is generally pretty average, and at times can be poor. The staff are friendly but it's clear English is a second language. The food can be slow if they're backed up, and they will often get my order wrong, but are generally okay with giving me extra salad. 

Bottom line, it's cheap food so I would say temper your expectations when it comes to service. In terms of quality of food, I think it's great for the money but really unsure how it measures up to other kebabs."}
{"text":"Good price, clean, friendly. Lentil soup given with most meals is superb. I do takeout at least once a week for last few years and always same quality."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. The staff is very welcoming and the food is very tasty. They are so generous with their tadig and that will always make me come back. The cucumber yogurt is my favorite as well as the gormeh sabzi. Wait time could be a little less for take out, but I guess they are completing phone in orders as well."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the mood for kebob, this is my favorite place to go. The staff are inviting, the service is good and the food is a step above the rest.

 My regular order is the koobideh, which is always cooked perfectly. The soup or salad that accompanies it is average, but the entree more than compensates. The dining area is clean, but I find it a little dimly lit. Prices are reasonable and they sell glass bottled soda, which I like.

Overall, I'd say this is one of the best kebob restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very good pricing.  Decent food.  Friendly staff.  Has a TV.  Good place to just chill out or get take out.  Nothing fancy so don't expect too much.  Family owned and run.  Their soup is okay.  Their meat is pretty awesome.  Pretty good overall."}
{"text":"We got take-out from here. For the first time. The prices are great for the portion you get so we were happy with that. The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and nice. The reason I can not give this place 4 or 5 stars is because the taste is just OK. It's not as tasty as I would expect based on the reviews, but the quantity vs. price ratio seems like a great value, so I won't rule it out, I've just had a better tasting kebob elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty this was! A nice Persian place with lots of Persian customers and a simple menu. They do lots of catering as you'll see when they're working but when you watch them you can see they make everything fresh. 

Kebobs are all made fresh to order over a big open flame. You get that very nice charred taste and the meat is so juicy and tender. 

What I ended up ordering, in need of a quick dinner was the special Lamb/beef Kebob mix dinner plate. At $7.99 it's a good value as a lot of places charge that much for a wrap only and most dinner plates are over $11. I can tell you I loved it. Meat seasoned well, maybe a little saltier than I would have made it but still lots of that good lamb and beef flavour. Very tasty rice and veg side. 

A little off the highway but a nice place to stop in if you're craving an authentic Persian Kebob. The dining room in nothing special and as such should be used for take out only. 

Will look to come back to take advantage of that good value dinner plate again.

3.5 rounded up to 4, out of 5.0"}
{"text":"The food is not bad at all. However, the service can use a major upgrade. The lady at the cash counter taking the order was very difficult to deal with. Big attitude problem. Most of the tables were full of leftover dishes. Had to ask twice to clean the table. Considering there are many other places in Richmond Hill selling similar and tastier food, I will not be coming here again. Might as well go to another place, pay similar amount in a better cleaner place and receive better service."}
{"text":"Tried their take out trays recently and really enjoyed it! We had the rice and crispy rice, mixed meat platter, and salad. Everything was delicious, especially the saffron rice and all the meats. We tried the chicken, pork and beef, they were all flavourful and very juicy."}
{"text":"Kebobs, kebobs and more kebobs.

Variety of kebabs and strange names, but I still like the food here.
Egg plant dishes are fabulous.

I prefer the beef kebabs and rice sprinkled with samac.

It's pretty good for the price I pay."}
{"text":"ORIGINAL REVIEW: Love their food. I always get the beef kebab with rice. Been going there for over 10 years and their quality is always consistent. They've moved a bit north now, but worth the trip. Hope they open one in Mississauga!

Update Jan 2015: They have changed their rice... For me, it made the taste not as good as before... Please bring back the original rice."}
{"text":"Food was great at the Little House of Kebab. It is the perfect place to get some authentic Persian food in Richmond Hill. I've been a regular guest at the restaurant for the past year, service has always been kind, and quality of the food is consistently good. Koobideh kebab, viziri, and barg are all recommended dishes. The lentil soup is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"Oh the garlicky goodness of a tender kebob!  I accompanied my Persian friend here as it was her favourite go to for rice and kebobs.  We were not disappointed. Well, my one disappointment is in not learning the proper names/pronunciation of all the food to aid with this review!

The food was good. It's a family run place.  We tried a trio of their soups - lentil soup would be my favourite.  The others lacked a bit of seasoning but it could just be that day.  Salad is a little heavy on the vinegar.  

The extra food (we had extra) taken home and reheated the next day was amazing.  What a great place and great to know it to go again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are friendly and for the price you pay, you get a generous tasty portion. 

I always get koobideh, which comes with two skewers of meat, rice and a grilled tomato. You also get a choice of soup/salad.. the soup is a delicious barley soup!

The restaurant is very clean and spacious and never busy; most people just drop in for takeout."}
{"text":"The quality of their kebab and rice are good. I Ordered food from there many many times. Staffs are friendly. Big portion size. Good price , specially their family pkg and party pkg. Recently I ordered their 1st party pkg ...the price, quality and portion were great! However, when they get busy, they get a little bit disorganized! Sometimes you need to remind them what you ordered. Overall, i recommend this place."}
{"text":"Didn't get the chance to try the food. The place was so disorganized, I couldn't even put an order for a kebob and a pita. There was another person who just left waiting for his kebob tray for a long time. That's too bad, place looks authentic."}
{"text":"A couple of things about this small Iranian restaurant confuse me.
There was a restaurant on Yonge near Dundas in downtown with the same name a couple of years ago. Are these the same people?
In Persian the food, which is their national dish, is called 'kabob' and not 'kebob.' Are these people actually Iranians or from a neighbouring country? It is probably a case of weak English. The plaza's name reads 'Leslie Center' instead of the correct 'centre' and they have something called 'yogurt and garlic,' which in fact should be 'yogurt and shallot.'

Whatever the case, I have found a new place that rivals Pardis, which is my favourite Iranian take-out place. Little House does have half a dozen tables, the ever tacky TV, etc for dine-in, but I was taking food out for dinner and was pleasantly surprised how delicious the food was. Moreover, for the price, which is cheaper than than most of the competition, there was neither a sacrifice in quality nor in portion size.
Most Iranian restaurants offer included salad with chelokabob. Here they offer soup or salad. The soup options are lentil or barley. Actually, I did not have a choice regarding soup or salad as they had run out of the latter. The lentil soup was tasty, but I am not convinced it is a good accompaniment to chelokabob.

My chelokabob (kabob and rice) was really delicious. The barg (sirloin) was a little overspiced, but satisfying. The koobideh (minced meat) was so good and tender and the chicken especially well marinated, soft and delicious. I am also sure all their different combinations are $2 or $3 cheaper than the other Iranian restaurants.

Based on the unavailability of salad, the slower service and a mess at the door where a whole bunch of ethnic newspapers were strewn and created a mess I want to give this place 3.5/5 because the employees were friendly and kind, the food was delicious and the portions generous."}
{"text":"The place owner and staffs are so nice. The owner is originally from a City in Iran (Golpayegan) which is famous for Persian Kebab. I am from the same city, so I recommend their food."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find a Persian Restaurant in my area. I used to drive all the way to North York to get my koobideh fix :)

I usually order the koobideh, and this place is pretty good. I have read complaints about the lack of \"meat\" but in my opinion - you get enough. There's usually a heaping scoop of rice topped with meat and a side salad and a roasted tomato. I personally don't like the balsamic dressing, so if I take out I'll just use my own salad dressing.

Koobideh is $7.99 for the meal (no drink). I think for the price it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Koobidehs to go and when I got home they were both Chicken. I'm so disappointed.  I've been craving for Koobideh for a while. Yes, growning up with Persian friends, I've my good share of Koobidehs. More than what I can count. 

On the bright side, the chicken Kebob was perfectly cooked and marinated. The tomatoes was charcoal enough and got half per meal. Unless I've forgotten, usually it's 1 whole tomatoes at other places. Instead of bread, the meal came with a piece of crunchy rice bottom (I'm a fan of that!)

Ok, I'll don't now hey can screw it up. When I ordered, I saw her turn around and grabbed 4 beef skewers and placed it onto the grill. Argh!! So Frustrated!  Maybe one day I'd go back, but coming all this way you had 1 chance to get me hooked with your Koobideh! =("}
{"text":"Great food, great experience for a quick bite. The food is delicious, especially the \"Koobideh Kebob\". Portions are large, \"you get what you pay for.\" Service is kind and friendly, and food is prepared fast. This has become my \"go-to\" place when I'm hungry, because the atmosphere is also warm and inviting. Definitely give this place a try, it has become one of my favourite restaurants in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for kebob in Richmond Hill. the cooke tasty and juicy kebob.I always go with Combo because it comes with lovely soup."}
{"text":"Little House of Kebob is the best decorated and cleanest Self Serve Persian grill house I have been to!

Everything so clean and in order, even the washroom is immaculately spotless!

Order at the counter with the option of eating in or takeout. We decided to share 2 entrees which both comes with a choice of soup or salad.

Koobideh Kebob ($6.99)
- cooked to order, fresh of the grill taste
- Mixture of grounded lamb and beef, a little gamey for my taste. The meat though is moist 

Lamb Shank ($9.99)
- Surprisingly tender and well flavoured! 
- Rice on the side is mixed with rosemary and fava beans

Portion is quite decent at this price point. We left happy and fulfilled!

Love how our meals are served on real plates and cutlery! I just can't stand eating from Styrofoam!

Definitely would be back again for their stew! Fesenjan ($8.99) and Ghormeh Sabzi ($6.99) which comes with rice and soup/salad, sound delicious!"}
{"text":"You get a great big portion for the price you pay. It even comes with a starter - house salad or soup. The koobideh itself is quite nicely seasoned, especially since it contained alot of onions in it. the decor is nice and the service was absolutely friendly. Definitely worth a trip here for kebob."}
{"text":"I love this spot and don't get to come to it enough. I wish they were still located near Dundas Square - they moved up to Richmond Hill maybe a year or so before I moved downtown, so I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted eating here. But it was great when I was still living up n north.

They have one of the juciest joojeh (chicken) kebobs I've ever had (I always get dark meat), and they are marinated perfectly. They don't cheap out here - they have lamb in their koobideh - but I personally don't like lamb, so I typically just stick to the chicken. Otherwise my standard order at Persian eateries is always, always, always vaziri - a chicken kebob plus koobideh with rice, often served with a salad and grilled tomato. They are also great about giving me some tah deeg (crispy rice from the bottom/side of the pot), which I don't get at all the places I go to. 

This place is also run by the nicest family! And you can watch your food prepared fresh in front of you because the grill is right behind the cash register and front counter.

I miss the Little House - must come back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean family restaurant.  Great for satisfying any craving you may be having for Persian food.  I had the koobideh kebab and it was delicious."}
