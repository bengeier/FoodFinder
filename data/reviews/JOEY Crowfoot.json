{"text":"I've received good service here before but not recently. The hostess didn't notice we were there so we went to sit in the lounge. We had no problem with that. The waitress came right away and was nice but chose not to give us good service. We waited for water for 10 minutes then ordered sangria's. After 15 minutes of waiting I asked the server if we still had sangrias coming and she told us she had not yet put the order through. I know when restaurant is busy service takes longer but it was not busy. There were maybe 6 full tables and waitresses were on their phones at the bar. I would love to eat here if I wasn't concerned about whether or not I would actually get food."}
{"text":"My first time to this Joey location, and probably my last.   My first impression was of the decor, very underwhelming for what seems to be a recently renovated restaurant. They seemed to have really missed the boat here.   Then there's the service. Our server was okay, but overall it seems as though they have a lot of young, inexperienced wait staff and hostesses. And for some reason several of them think it's acceptable to walk backward, bumping into customers and other wait staff carrying plates of food.   The food was good, but way overpriced for the quality.  It's casual fare at best, but priced much higher. I ordered the full rack of ribs at $27.50, about $4 or $5 too high. The ribs were okay, but very salty fries and a mediocre slaw. And for that price I want something more than bad fries with my ribs.   I think there are many better restaurant options in Calgary, especially at that price point."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, the food, the service, the drinks, the place and the decor. My favorite meal is the tuna salad, the dressings are to die for. Too bad there's no Joeys in Montreal"}
{"text":"Their service is horrible. I've eaten here twice, and have not enjoyed either dish I ordered. There was no discussion about resolving the matter either occasion. This type of service will drive customers away in the long run. There's a reason for the short skirts on good looking staff. It distracts nicely from the food and service."}
{"text":"Overall, I love this restaurant.  I have been countless times and can never decide what to order, the ahi tuna tacos, the ahi tuna burger, the ahi tuna salad. Yes, I have an obsession with ahi tuna.   Everything I've had here has been delicious, even when I venture away from my usual rare tuna, like the starter pizzas and thai green curry.  The service is always excellent and attentive. I'm not a huge fan of the raised area seating arrangements, I feel a bit \"on show\" to other tables.  I've been going regularly over 2 years and never had any issues, would recommend to anyone. I'm looking forward to hitting up the patio this summer."}
{"text":"Food was good, but our waitress was not the greatest, maybe that's why she worked the bar side as all she did was talk to other wait staff.  She did swing by the table to take order, was very slow waited 15 min, secondly she came by to take plates away, finally we asked for the bill as she walked by only to receive it 10 min later. I like Joeys but they need to get better staff!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Service and food has always been consistent! The crowfoot location has been our favourite for the past 10 years! And now we can't wait for the patio to open up soon."}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid eating at chain restaurants, but when friends start suggesting other chains for a meal, I usually try to steer them towards Joey Tomato's.    The Crowfoot location looks like any other mid-range fusion chain restaurant (Cactus Club, Earls, Milestones, etc.)- lots of dark wood, metal and amber lighting.  The staff are always extremely friendly (bordering on fake) and I've never had a problem with speed or accuracy of service.  One of the main reasons I try to steer meals away from Joey's competitors and back to Joey's is that they carry an excellent mock meat product that they can use in many of their dishes.  Now their website is down as I write this, but I can recall eating a great \"chicken\" souvlaki recently, as well as a good Thai-inspired curried \"chicken\" bowl in the past.  I'm not usually a fan of vegetarian \"meat\" products, but the one at Joey's is really good.  They've obviously got a million other things on the menu as well, from meal-sized salads to sandwiches to steaks.    Joey's is definitely my top chain restaurant choice in northwest Calgary."}
{"text":"If you want good people watching go here. If you want good service, go elsewhere.   While all wait staff seem to be hired for their looks, brains seem to be a forgotten consideration in this joint.   Our waitress smiled and repeatedly looked at our empty sugar packets and cream container on the table while asking if we wanted cream and sugar with our coffee refills. She then proceeded to take our cups away to refill them, rather than bring the carafe to the table. At one point she brought my \"re-fill\" back to me half full and said \"we're out of coffee, want me to brew more?\" (Um, yes please).    We were seated next to the kitchen which was a floor show in itself. Throughout our meal we got to watch a pretty young waitress hang off her beau in the kitchen. Flirting. Kissing. Hugging. I felt bad for her tables. Our waitress was rather vacuous but at least she was somewhat attentive. The people at kissin' Jane's table probably starved to death.   The food was good. My son & I enjoyed our burgers. My aunt relished her lettuce wrap. Our food came hot and rather quickly but the service and floor show distracted from what would have been a good meal."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and tepid service. We started with the Spinach & Artichoke dip. It was alright I guess. Not going to have it again. Maybe it should come with pita instead of tortilla chips? It was boring and took way too long to arrive. For my meal I had the Souvlaki. Again, it was ok. Nothing stands out at all. I could've gotten something more colorful and certainly more flavorful in a mall food court. In fact, OPA does it better and doesn't charge me as much! Hubby had the Ahi Tuna Burger which he enjoyed. I wish the servers had offered to refill our drinks more but they didn't come by the table often enough. Overall our experience was mediocre. The only reason to go back is if there isn't another option. Given the location, there will always be another option!"}
{"text":"Joey Tomato's was both bad and good this time at our annual family gathering of 14 people. First the bad - no food for most for over an hour, what food came much was really cold, rare drink refills, generally a service disaster. Now the good - they apologized profusely (server and manager) and wrote off $100 of appetizers plus many meals plus gave free desserts. Very nice, genuine attempt at recovery notwithstanding they forgot one of the make-up desserts. So they could have another chance but boy this will be a hard one to forget. We've gone there multiple times per year for several years, so a big enough loss if they motivate us to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A couple girlfriends of mine and I decided to do lunch at Joey Tomatoes.  The hostesses were pleasant, opened the door for me, offered us a sample of wine, which I would never pass up!  We arrived after the lunch rush so we only waited about 5 minutes for our table.    The server gave us time to make up our minds on what to drink, she didn't hover around.  She did the same when we needed another minute to decide what to order for food.  She was very efficient and knew the wines on the menu well.  When we got our food, she would pop by occasionally and see how everything was, if we needed anything.  I had a bellini, my favorite, it was very good and I like the frozen peach they put in it!  A friend and I shared the calamari and tempura for an appy, it was good, the breading was a bit heavy and the tempura veggies were a bit lame.  I had the chicken alfredo, the presentation was nice.  The alfredo sauce was a bit oily, not creamy, but it did taste good.  The chicken looked like it had been massacred into little bits before they grilled it and there wasn't all that much.  The overall portion size of my pasta was decent.  For the cost of food, $10 for the calamari and $16 for the alfredo, the quality could have been better.  I finished it nonetheless and did enjoy it.  I would go back to Joey's for the occasional lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  I did like the atmosphere in the lounge and since its close to home, I would definitely go there for a drink or two!"}
{"text":"Food was beyond amazing, and staff is very friendly and accommodating. Wait times can be a bit long but worth it!"}
{"text":"Am from Los Angeles visiting friends. Stopped by for a late lunch and had one of the most wonderful & causal lunches with my best friend. The service was first class and the food was fresh and tasty, we dined on the patio and our server went out of her way to help us with the menu and find a drink to celebrate our long over due reunion.. Just so you can understand How much we enjoyed the food & service we invited another friend to join us for lunch today. What fun! With the wonderful weather the patio was Always full..  I highly recommend Joey's.. You will be a very happy person when you leave..."}
{"text":"Usual chicken is drier then normal, bartender was very accommodating, egg plant veggies, got substituted at my request, and her recommendation. Which was nice."}
{"text":"The two of us went to grab an early dinner. Lucky no wait. Get your bums down there before 6pm and take advantage of their happy hour. We very much enjoyed the sangrias. The ahi tuna tacos were small and a little messy to eat, so do consider that for your dates. My friend got the steak and it came with these potatoes spring-roll look-alikes. The portion seemed very decent.   I got the Angus beef dip, needless to say, I did not finish. It was huge! The bread was on the dry side, unfortunately they cheaped out on the au jus as well! The fries were exactly like McDonald's fries - golden, crispy and thinly sliced. The ketchup complemented them nicely.   Overall, not bad, not impressed and not disappointed. Service was decent. Food was okay. Sangria was great!"}
{"text":"I normally love Joey's - but not this location.  Been there twice and have yet to pay for a meal because of bad food, bad service and a creepy floor manager named Adam.  The sad thing is I always order the same meal at any Joey's in BC, Seattle or Calgary and this location is the only one that is so disappointing.  It makes me sad since it is the closest location to my house.    My last experience included rotten tomatoes which the manager Adam tried to convince me were \"vine-ripened\" and that is the way they are supposed to be.  When he took them into the kitchen they agreed with me so he came out to our table to say I was right and ended up debating with me again and saying \"I don't know a lot about food.\"  Um...really?  You work in a restaurant right?  Let me enlighten you - you also don't know much about customer service either.  To their credit the restaurant invited us back to dine on them - but the last two experiences have been so bad we are not planning on taking them up on it.  Bad is bad - even if it is free."}
{"text":"While most restaurants are getting better and better at gluten-free, Joey's has gotten worse. You can have a steak, butter chicken, a protein-style burger or one of their four salads (salad shouldn't be that hard to make gf). Thank goodness we had a gift card or we would've walked out. This used to be a favourite, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"My other half and I went to this location for our anniversary dinner and we had a great time!  We had calamari to start, and it was some of the best cooked calamari I have ever had! We both had a steak, my bf had steak and sushi and I had steak Frites. We both ordered our steaks rare, and they came out perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. We ordered a bottle of wine, which paired nicely with everything we ordered and didn't over power anything (Gunderloch Fritz's Riesling) and they comped up almost the entire bottle (only a $10 wine charge on our bill). Overall our food was amazing, and the ambiance and service were great, we would both eat here again in a heart beat! Thanks Joey Crowfoot for making our special night that much more special!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten this Joey's for what feels like a decade. And speaking of a decade, last night, I met up with a girlfriend that I hadn't seen for a decade at this location of Joey's and boy were we impressed!   We sat in the lounge and were there for about 4 hours. I ordered the vegetarian Chinatown lettuce wraps and my girlfriend ordered the Viva salad. Not only was our food fantastic, but the service is what really sealed the deal for me. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. She got the hint when we first got there that we needed about an hour to just catch up. She completely left us alone, and let us get all caught up, and THEN she came to take our order.   I don't have a single complaint about our experience at this particular Joey's last night.   Fantastic all around, and I WILL be back :)"}
{"text":"Joeys in Crowfoot is your standard Joeys food chain with pretty good food, even at lunch. Typically known for after work drinks and dinner but their lunch menu is just as convenient and good quality.  If you have been, you should try their staple appetizer lettuce wrap... It's been on the menu for ever and you'll be happy you ordered it.   Their menu had a good variety from Sushi, to burgers, to fish tacos and steak. They also provide take out which I find to be a good option if you want a good meal at home.   Overall, their staff are friendly... Sometimes it seems they hire more for looks then brains."}
{"text":"I spontaneously decided to go for lunch with  my 4 year old son. Although the don't have a kid's menu, all the servers were very attentive and efficient. My boy is a cutie, so inside of 45min all the women and the manager knew his name and were happy to ensure he was happy. It was totally hilarious. I had the prawn curry bowl and my son had the lobster gilled cheese. Both were delicious.  I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for a drink and afternoon snack.  The parking lot is too small and even though we arrived after the lunch rush, parking was still trying. Ended up parking at Rona instead.  No wait when we arrived, which was nice but the service in the hour we were there was mediocre at best. We sat for about 15 mins before our drink order was even taken. To save time, we grabbed some menus and thought we better order everything at the same time since we may never see our waitress again. We shared an appie (Spinach dip of some sort) as well as a couple drinks.  I will admit we were left alone the whole time. Only time we saw our waitress was for our drink/food order and never saw her again. Wish I could say it was because it was busy but it wasn't. Its nice to be left alone however we were planning on having some dessert but since we didnt see our waitress again, that wasnt going to happen.  The drinks were fine and the appie okay. Not the best dip I have had but fine enough. Service is really lacking.  We were ready to leave so just went to the hostess to let her know we needed our bill. We paid and got out of there. Not sure if I would venture to this location again. I have been to other Joey's and its always been pretty good."}
{"text":"I know this place since 2009 when it was called 'Joey Tomatoes'. At that time I was enjoying my visit and came a couple of times each year.  After the re-branding the menu got more fancy and expensive but the food didn't get better in my opinion. We haven't been here for quite a while but my recent experience won't make me miss it."}
{"text":"Best Steak and desserts Ever!! My steak au Champignon was perfectly cooked medium rare and was the perfect cut with additional seasonal veggies on the side. The Demi glaze mushroom sauce topped it off nicely too and the Apple Pie and Chocolate  Desserts were so Delish they were inhaled in minutes!!"}
{"text":"Good food with good service. Fancy and corporate look with modest prices. Good for couples and families. Great choice of appetizers, entrees and dessert. Enjoyed my key lime dessert."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent and it was busy for a lunch hour on a Monday. The service was ok, didnt refill the water often, were slow to get the check when we had to get back to work. All in all if I had to go back I would, but It wouldnt be my first choice. We had the appetizers and main dish, the crispy chicken and gyoza apps were good and flavorful, the butter chicken dish was sweet and just OK not authentic but in a pinch i guess its fine? Salmon was FULL of butter it was almost gross."}
{"text":"My friend and I were here celebrating a belated birthday and splurged on food and drinks. It's not cheap but hey, she was worth it. What we ate/drank was pretty good and the service was right on too, so I figure a solid 3 stars is in order.  Joey's has some good food however you have to know what those items on the menu are. One of their signature dishes is the Chinatown Lettuce Wraps. They have crispy noodles, peppers, green onions, peanuts, cilantro all in a spicy hoisan sauce. You put the noodle mixture in the big pieces of lettuce and roll them up, like a little salad roll. Boy are they good!   The Belini's here are my favorite. Really, who needs food when you have slushy fruity drinks? They even throw in a frozen slice of peach. Yeah, these are always on my list when I go to Joey's.   We both had the Lobster Grilled Cheese with yam fries. It was pretty tasty but would have been a step up if they had used some nicer bread. It seemed like it was just regular white bread here, nothing fancy. The yam fries were totally overdone, like fried up little sticks. They sure need a lesson in how to make decent yam fries.  Joey's is one of those restaurants that I can take or leave. The one up in Crowfoot has beautiful decor, kinda warm and inviting with some nice stone work and the ceilings are absolutely amazing. They are really high, with these huge wrought iron square chandeliers. This location is more classy than the one down town. Guess you're paying for part of the ambiance, not just the food."}
{"text":"Down a star. Our group of 6 was out tonight to enjoy food, drink, each other's company, Joey's was chosen due to its NW location and the menu variety. There seems to be something for everyone no matter your diet or how picky you are. Dinner took quite awhile to come (no appies were ordered), no water was offered and drink orders were very slow to be taken. When the food did finally arrive, a couple of our friends could not believe their side of veg they specified that they wanted - 3 thin slices of mushroom and one small quarter size medallion of zucchini on each plate for pricey dishes of salmon and steak. They were so not impressed. They quietly mentioned it to our server who shrugged it off stating that was the portion. No resolution offered. It was even more downhill from there and no one really wanted to ask for anything after that. Had our waitress been more attentive tonight and gave a rat's ass about service, she would have had a far better food/dessert/bar bill in which to garner her tip from. Oh well, she just was not into working tonight. A hiked up little black dress can only get you so far in life, my dear. I had the Panang Red Curry Bowl. The flavor was there, but my food obviously sat at the pass for awhile as it was a step away from being stone cold. I did not have the heart to send it back as our table already had 2 pissed off diners. Had the experience been better, we would go back again as we go out fairly enough. TIP - the ambiance is nice enough here. Please get rid of the brown McDonalds Napkins and provide decent ones for your diners."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I wanted to grab a bite and both of us were in the non-deciding phase, so we said let's go to Crowfoot and see what we see. Joey was the first so we popped in. The place was packed, we got a table way at the back, followed by terrible service.   I asked her for the gluten free menu, which was nice that they do offer that (only reason they got 2 stars). I then proceeded to order the GF salmon, our food finally came and my mashed potatoes were wrapped in something deep fried. So I asked if this was the GF salmon dish to which I got a deer in headlights look and a umm no. Can I get what I ordered please? They came out to ask me if it was a preference or an allergy and how sensitive was I, basically they were just going to take the potatoes out of the wrapping and serve it to me.  It took forever to get our bill when we were done, and the food wasn't that good, especially since I was worried about eating the food (I did get sick). It will be a long time, if ever before I return to that location."}
{"text":"We had just returned from visiting family in Toronto, before we went home we decided to stop at Joey's for a bite to eat. We showed up on a Friday night, it was extremely busy. The place was packed to the door... which is a good sign! We were greeted by a young girl who offered us drinks while we waited. I was with my mother in-law and they brought out a chair from the back so she could sit down. They certainly catered to us and made sure we had whatever we wanted. I had the honey-garlic steak with mixed greens and a ceaser. Our waiter was extremely personable and took excellent care of us. Fast service, great atmosphere. Polite staff. They also brought us fish tacos as an appetizer, they were delicious! Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this Joey's, and our second disappointing experience.  We were greeted warmly, and seated quickly.  The drink girl was also fast, but then it went downhill.  After we got our drinks we sat for 30 minutes with no sign of our server.    \"I'm sorry, there eas some confusion about sections.\"  If that had been the end of issues, we would have been forgiving.  Our order got taken and everything looked good!  Twenty minutes later, \"your appetizer is just coming out of the oven\" [server code for a) I forgot it, or b) someone else took it].  It finally arrives, with 2/3 the normal amount of chips.  We get two bite in and our meal arrives.  The food itself was good, but the service failed. We will NOT be back to Joey's Crowchild!"}
{"text":"Was pretty good. I was craving souvlaki...so that's what I ordered.  It wasn't how I've normally eaten it but nonetheless it was very good. The chef seems to be pretty creative.  Next time I'll ask no feta on salad as I'm not a feta type of woman - I like the atmosphere, though yes, as another reviewer said (\"the waitresses are so young they can be our kids\") yes that's was true, the girls who serve are all very young- 18-20 years old.  Our waitress was \"Courtney\" she was so sweet- 18 yrs old but she did care about our food and our service and she was very sweet!"}
{"text":"It's An Ok Restaurant.. Nothing Special.. Just Like Earls Or Moxies. Don't Care To Go Back."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Good cocktails.  So many similar options available, but always consistent at Joeys.  Good any time."}
{"text":"Like other Joey locations and \"mid-tier chain\" restaurants, you can expect good food and service.  My favourite dish is the lobster grilled cheese.  This is a good location to meet friends for lunch or a mid-afternoon drink and appie, as it's not overly crowded or busy during the day."}
{"text":"Joey Crowfoot is one of my favourite chains, the food is consistently good. The one complaint is that they change it up too often for my liking. This chain is one of the few that offer meat substitutes for certain items on their menu and I've tried the meat free versions and it's pretty good. As more of my friends opt for a vegetarian or vegan diet Joey's is a good option as I don't feel guilty that my friends will be hard pressed to find something on the menu. I find most locations fairly noisy so it's not a place I consider for a quiet talk and lingering after your meal is generally taxing on your vocal chords. Desserts are pretty good too but do pack on the calories."}
{"text":"Joey's is one of those places that you visit with a small group of friends or on a casual date (although beware because the waitresses tend to be really hot and wandering eyes can get you into trouble). The food is mediocre but not amazing but the atmosphere is really nice and fairly conducive to a good evening. The menu selection is fairly diverse. They don't shine in any one particular thing but everything is fairly edible overall. The problem is that the food is severely overpriced for the portion and quality of food you get (although this seems to be the rule in Calgary).  Also, don't expect amazing service. The servers seem to be there more for eye candy than for actual service. Sometimes this is okay and sometimes this really blows.  I would say that Joey's is one of the better food choices for chain restaurants in the area but if you can venture a bit further than you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"It's like the owners of this formerly good restaurant gave the management job to their retarded nephew because they felt obligated to help him out.   All 3 times I've been here in the past 3 months, the food has been terrible.  I suspect that they got rid of their chef & now only have relatively inexperienced line cooks working there (no \"grey hair\" in the open kitchen - they're all VERY YOUNG and inexperienced looking.    Calamari is heavy, greasy and has a super thick coating.  The aioli is heavy & flavourless.  Gyoza are served burned on the bottom & fridge cold on top, while lying in a cold pool of greasy chilli oil.  Panang prawn curry consists of a flavourless pool of coconut curry from a can, mixed with a centre tower of soggy partially reheated rice and a few tiny shrimps with obvious freezer burn.   This is all mixed with innumerable chilli flakes as to cause a chemical burn in anyone disrespectful enough of their palates to try it.    The chicken sandwich comes with a jalepeño cole slaw in it that has to be tried before being able to fully appreciate the depravity of skill needed to create such a horrific rendering of a normally wonderful combination of texture & flavour.  A trained circus monkey could do far better.    The only thing one could do to further wreck this chicken sandwich, is to slather the whole thing in Durkie's hot sauce - and they did it!  None of this is described in the menu. Service was totally lacking and bored very young staff were standing around socializing with each other while both outnumbering and ignoring the few patrons in the restaurant.  Manager never came to talk about our miserable experience - so our only recourse was to pay the bill - sans tip.  The restaurant really should have paid US to suffer such a terrible experience not seen for many years in over 12 countries!   This place is a veritable textbook case in how to run a terrible restaurant.  This place would be a perfect candidate for that restaurant makeover show....and they'd have to start with replacing the retarded management staff."}
{"text":"B - List. Good food and service. Other places do it better. Nice lights out front."}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals in awhile here. We first had to sit at the bar while we waited for a spot on the patio, which was fine.   The lounge / bar staff really took care of us. We only had to wait about half an hour for a table in the patio. Our waiter was amazing, Daylon, he was prompt, personal, never kept us waiting for drinks or water, didn't come around too often or not enough.   The steak was perfect, I rarely order something that restaurants can't do as well as me, this was definetly not the case here. I ordered it medium rare and it was done to perfection! The wine we ordered was awesome! We were there about 2.5 h and never felt rushed!"}
{"text":"This is my mother's favourite restaurant to visit in Calgary. She lives in Northern Canada and she looks forward to going out to nice restaurants whenever she comes to visit.  Joey consistently serves amazing food. My mom ordered their steak and mushroom dish with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I ordered their rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables. We also tried their summer sangria drink special. We were both very pleased with the taste and quality of the food. You will never hear me complain about the food here!  Even though the food was excellent, our experience was completely ruined. We sat in the lounge and while we were waiting on our food, my mom realized that she had sat in gum. I had to use a steak knife to try and scrape it off her pants and she ended up having to go to the restroom to try and scrape/wash it off. While she was in the restroom, the manager came over and remarked how rude some people can be (that someone would actually leave their gum on a chair). He promised that once my mom returned, he would come back and apologize to her and make sure that she was okay. He then picked up the chair and attempted to carry it out of the lounge. The manager bumped a woman in the head who was sitting next to us. Quite the fiasco.  Anyways, the manager did not return to our table. However, 5 different men went to the table next to us to ensure the woman was okay. And I am pleased to report that she was okay! However, my mother was disgusted, humiliated and her dress pants were ruined all because someone didn't clean off our table and chairs.   Perhaps it is petty of me to post this review but my mother was extremely disappointed that no one cared about how she felt. I was quite disappointed as well. When you go to a sports bar, you usually check twice before sitting down. When you go to a higher end restaurant, such as Joey, you expect a higher point of service.   A simple apology from the manager would have changed our outlook on our experience. If my mom had received an apology, I probably wouldn't have told this story on Yelp. Small things, like simple apologies, in the restaurant business go a long way. Mom left Joey feeling like she was not cared for, that shouldn't happen in the hospitality business. I will think twice before returning to Joey in the future."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Joey Crowfoot.  We haven't eaten here for a long time.  Service was pretty good.  We ordered the following:  Mushroom Cheddar Burger with added Beach Salad - Really, juicy burger and that beach salad - so refreshing!  Blackened Basa Fish Dinner - really tasty basa meal; spice was just right!  Bombay Butter Chicken - great bowl of butter chicken with carrots, basmati rice on a small banana leaf, papadum.  Great blend of everything.  Sicilian Shrimp Linguine - Soooooo delicious!  It's a pesto sauce of pine nuts, currants, and all kinds of good stuff,   Lots of baby shrimp but done really well.  I'd come back just for the Siciilian Shrimp Linguine!!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed, food and drinks are always on point. Impressive for a chain!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here, parking has been brutal and the place is always packed. You can sit in the bar and order off the dining room menu.  Chris Mill the Iron Chef designed the entire menu and the food is great and the service has always been professional.  The staff always offers lots of good eye candy ;)"}
{"text":"I returned to JOEY last weekend, as I was looking for a late-night bite that wasn't fast food. I still haven't worked up the confidence to dine alone, so I opted to call for take out. I checked their menu out online, and I noticed that they have made some changes and I was excited about all the new additions. I decided to order the Steak & Sushi, as well as the Apple Pie for dessert. I arrived to pick it up (around 10PM) and waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to grab the food. In that time, I had 2 separate people ask me if I had been helped, which was nice, as I am used to JOEY having pretty awful service. When I got home I was delighted. The steak was cut into strips, which made it super easy to eat. It had a soy/teriyaki type of glaze, and was cooked to medium rare perfection. The sushi was their rainbow roll, and was extremely fresh and plentiful. I worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but I was wrong, it was very filling. I wish they would have provided chopsticks, but not a big deal - I already had some at home. The Apple Pie was HUGE. I could only eat half, but it was sooo good. A bit too much puff pastry, but it was very good. I was really impressed, take out only took 20 minutes and cost $30 (a little steep but I was feeling indulgent). I feel like JOEY is working on their service and their food, so I'll be back to give them another try - perhaps to face my fear and dine alone!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Joey's. I am. My wife and I are always quite excited to go for dinner here, like we did last Friday, prior to a movie. It's our usual, though totally infrequent, date night spot.   A few things to know about Joey Crowfoot:  a) If you 're going to dinner on a weekend. You're gonna wait. We waited for half an hour. Not bad. And, there's always the lounge, which is first come first served. The good thing about waiting are the free samples and wine - a nice treat.  b) The staff are all your teenagers age, Which means they mean well, but can sometimes come across as fake little bitches who really don't give a damn. Our server was awesome. He was genuinely into making our night a good one - even brought be a few sample beers after he poured a bit of the first one on the ground. All good.  c) The dinner menu is limited. The salads are killer. The burgers and sandwiches are awesome. But the mains are limited to a few pastas, a couple of Asian bowls, and a few steak dishes that were way overpriced. I had the curry bowl, which was loaded with goodness, but not worth the $17. My wife had the grilled chicken salad, which she said \"hit the spot.\"  d) The drink menu is pretty good. Joey's has a limited two-beer selection of their handcrafted ales, which I truly enjoy. They just hit the spot. They are also known for their cocktails and it's highly recommended for a group of dudes or dudettes looking to start off their night.  e) The atmosphere is great. This is really why we like coming here so much. It's up beat, fun, and everyone seems to be there to enjoy themselves. It's kinda loud though so if you're looking for something a bit quiet, move on.  That's all I got."}
{"text":"Appallingly slow service The many, beautiful serving staff were all rushing around like they had plenty to do, but it didn't translate into actual service.  The food was okay, so if you have all the time in the world to hang out, then by all means.  It is very noisy, however, so not a great place to spend a long time just hanging out. But if you want to get through a family meal in a reasonable timeframe while on your way from point A to point B, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"My first visit was this week and so far, so good.  I like the atmosphere, had great service and their Szechuan Edamame is the best prepared edamame I've ever had.  In fact, we were dipping steak in the leftover sauce because it was so flavorful.  The Chili Chicken isn't excessively breaded.  I also sampled their soup of the day, which was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was literally 10 years old (back when it was called Joey's tomato). This is a classic family favourite, but our last visit was not too impressive which was disappointing since I no longer live in Canada and was super excited.  We waited a little over 15 minutes just to get service and what made this even worse was that our waitress was talking to her friend the whole entire time we were waiting."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I have been to this Joey restaurant, but a majority vote and a 2 hour wait at the Keg landed us here.  We were a relatively large group and on the plus side they were able to accommodate us rather quickly and I was happy to see that they now have booster seats for those with babies, last I remembered, Joey didn't have any kiddie seating for parents with little ones in tow, so kudos on that.  First off, I had been to the Barlow location a couple of months ago, and I noticed slight differences between these restaurants.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna sashimi big salad which I felt was priced a bit steep at over $18 but was delicious none the less.  As we sat I already knew that it was something I wanted to have as it was a hit at Barlow, my husband and I decided on sharing a rainbow roll to start and I felt like a Caesar to wet my whistle. The rainbow roll was great, for a restaurant chain sushi roll, I was pleasantly surprised. The Caesar was pretty bunk, like really watered down and overly spiced, and just not right, I barely got through a couple of sips and informed the waitress that is was not right.  Although she offered to fix it, we barely saw her till the food arrived and at that point, I was no longer interested in said Caesar.  I know its not her fault, and she was a very sweet girl but had it been taken care of immediately it wouldn't be an issue.  My husband ordered the salmon rice bowl which was delicious although it was on the smaller side, and the portion of salmon was quite small as well.   My Ahi salad came and, sigh, it was much smaller than the Barlow Joeys.  I'm not a big eater but, really?  Like the tuna portion was so small, like maybe 3 oz of 1 inch squares of tuna sliced super thin.  Were they short on tuna? Also the Barlow location places a lovely fan of half an avocado on top which balances the flavor of the tuna in the salad, here it was a couple of tiny slices with mostly baby greens. I noticed two chunks of mango where Barlow slices theirs and they are abundant, the entire balance was off here and the only redeeming thing about this $18 salad was the delicious dressing.  So disappointed with the Caesar and Ahi salad, wish I would have ordered the salmon bowl, perfect char and flavor in that dish.  Our dining companion also thought her Caesar was underwhelming and their meals although very good, priced a little on the high side.  Also, we were all freezing, we sat at the large round family table in the back and the AC was blaring and it was pouring outside, I couldn't wait to eat and get out of there.  Our dining companion ordered a coffee before his meal and another one afterwards because he was so cold!  All in all, the potential is there, but quality/portion control with staying on par with Joey Barlow would have changed this two star review to a 4.  Being freezing cold for the duration of dinner, lacklustre cocktails, $200 for 5 adults and 3 kids was on the pricey side so I don't think as a family I would not come back to Joey Crow, I will stick to Joey Barlow for my Ahi salad fix."}
