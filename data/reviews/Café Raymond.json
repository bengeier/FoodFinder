{"text":"Order breakfast up at the Counter to the perkiest. , sweetest girl ever.   She will send you to your table with really good coffee and about 2 seconds later your steaming hot fresh breakfast arrives at your table. Vibe is totally mellow and friendly.

Yummy baked goods and fresh sqoozed OJ at counter.potatoes this am a little too salty and a little dry.  But overall - happy bellies.

The Strip here is a lot of fun. Old Italian meat markets meet high end chocolate and entry of Steelers t-shirts!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. 

We thought to go check out a place up the block, because it had great yelp reviews. Apparently, so did 500 other people, but they thought quicker. The line was down the block and around the corner, so we walked around and saw an empty table here. Glad we did.

I had a salad and juice, boy friend had the special - huevos rancheros with chili verde. I was happy, he liked his but said it wasn't worth what I paid for it. Saw a ton of people with french toast that looked unbelievably good, and the breakfast sandwich croissants looked great too. I won't drive across town for it, but any time I'm in the strip won't mind stopping in for a bite."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Cafe Raymond while exploring the Strip on a busy Saturday afternoon.  It appeared to be the only place where you could sit and eat without either a) going to one of the touristy joints along Penn Ave or b) grabbing food from a market stand.  Not to knock the market wares...I was tempted but we needed to rest our feet.

It's a small, simple cafe with excellent sandwiches and salads.  High quality ingredients and decent prices. All in all, a nice little neighborhood option."}
{"text":"Café Raymond: Overlooked by Those Seeking the Overrated

I always shake my head as I pass the line of tourists who are waiting for their turns to scrounge on greasy plates from a certain local breakfast spot in the strip... no doubt taking their recommendations from a re-run of Man vs. Food.   Apparently many out-of-towners are fans of the overrated.  In fact, they are so blinded by plates covered with entire cans of Reddi Whip, that they are missing out on one of the true \"best breakfasts\" in town just a few blocks up the strip.  If you prefer quality over excessive quantity, it's time to skip the line and give Café Raymond the attention it deserves. 

Café Raymond is fittingly named after Raymond Mikesell.  He's a yinzer from the Northside with some serious food credits.  He's baked for famous peeps like Cal Ripken Jr. and has lived in romantic places like France...he also lived amongst the dirty birdy fans of Baltimore for a decade, but let's move on.  He could have opened his café anywhere, but we're lucky enough to have Chef Raymond back in the 'Burgh. 

As you approach the café, you'll see some al fresco tables where patrons are often found freely advertising the fresh, local ingredients to be had.  Once inside, you can peruse the chalkboard menu of breakfast and lunch items.  On Saturdays and Sundays they offer up two breakfast specials, most often a specialty omelet and pancakes, in addition to the regular menu.  A few weeks ago I had the most amazing breakfast sandwich.  It was egg, applewood smoked bacon, mixed greens, tomato, and chipotle mayo on perfectly toasted slices of brioche.  I seriously could've eaten an entire loaf of that bread... causing all the gluten heads to cover their eyes and hide their children.  I also love their seasonal pancake specials...the Blueberry Ricotta are deceivingly light and fluffy considering they are made using buckwheat.  I'm looking forward to this fall when I can fulfill my pumpkin pancake cravings.

{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast!!
The egg omelette I had was huge and delicious! My bf had the bacon egg and cheese on a croissant- also huge! Each came with a side of thick seasoned potatoes! We both left very full and very satisfied! Saw some people eating sandwiches and they looked yummy too!! The menu gad a nice variety and they were very willing to make substitutions to what we ordered. Everyone seems to think DeLucas and Pamela's are the place to go, but I actually found the food here to taste better and the best part is there was no line to wait/get in!! I'd definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Happened to come across this place by chance.  This good fortune can only be attributed to what my friend calls \"clean living\".

At any rate, this place has seriously good food.  I had the spinach and feta omelet.  Omelet was light and fluffy and feta didn't over power.  Pancakes and french toast looked awesome too.  Menu also includes sandwiches and salads. Maybe next time. 

This is a no frills oder at the counter style cafe."}
{"text":"I had heard about Cafe' Raymond from at friend who comes here often for lunch so my husband and I decided to give it a try. I ordered a BLT on croissant and he had a corned beef sandwich. We also had 2 Chocolate covered Biscotti to munch on while we waited for our lunches. 
The biscotti were perfect! The bakery case had many other delicious looking treats that I will be back to try.
The sandwiches arrived with sides of seasoned potatoes, which were the only drawback to the meal- they were cold. My BLT was very good- the croissant was delicious. My husband was also pleased with the corned beef. 
As other reviewers have noted, it is a tight space, but worth a try. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast or lunch while in the strip district!! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Delicious--great value for the price point, which is 7.50-8:50 a sandwhich/salad. The salads are huge, and the sandwiches are stacked high. We sat outside in the awesome weather we are having, and decided it is our new go-to lunch spot in the strip. Fast service too, and even in the cafe-setting the staff will bring your food to your table, which takes roughly 5 minutes.
Staff is open and friendly, highly recommended! And their roasted tomatoes are AMAZING--juicy and flavorful. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is easily the best deli I've been to in Pittsburgh and ranks in the top 5 delis of all time for me. Everything on the menu is creative, from salmon clubs to ham, brie and cranberry relish sandwiches...they've got something for you no matter what your tastes are. The salads are monstrous, the soup changes daily and is made from scratch, and the beverage choices are good. The only thing missing is booze, but that's not the point of this place. If their extensive regular menu isn't enough, there are rotating specials every day. They have THE best grilled cheese and tomato bisque ever, but you have to catch it on the right day - it's always a special and it's always random. It's a good idea to call first if that's what you're looking for.

Sandwiches are served with fresh made potato chips and a giant pickle spear - just like they should be in any good deli. In addition to everything tasting amazing, the presentation is gorgeous for a deli. Their food looks like something you'd see in a magazine photo shoot.

If you find yourself in, or near the strip during the daytime hours, do yourself a favor and stop in. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So, the only reason this restaurant gets two stars is because the menu is pretty good and the baked goods are good. We had breakfast there today (got there at 10:35). We ordered and sat down. Our meals didn't come for 45 minutes (a simple sandwich and omelet). Finally the meals come and they're served on wooden plates. Our observation is that they're having growth pains. The kitchen is poorly staffed and the wooden plates appear unsanitary. A couple major changes would make this pleasant Strip spot a five star."}
{"text":"we were hungry so hungry walking around strip district, wanting to avoid greasy pittsburgh food.  walked past cafe raymond, and saw the people inside, turned around and walked in.  good sandwiches, accompanying chips a little too salty.  maybe a better chip and a nice pickle and it would have 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Look out Delucas and Pamela's. They may be Pgh icons, but the food and ambiance at Cafe Raymond can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Strip District and don't eat at Primanti's I feel like I'm cheating on my spouse, so it's hard for me to branch out.  Yet, I really enjoyed my meal at Cafe Raymond.  I had the roast beef sandwich, and it was amanzing.  Everything was freshly made, and the bread was especially delicious. Perhaps a few too many onions for my taste, but that's just me, and onions are easy to pick off.  I was thrilled with my lunch here and will be back, even though it means cheating on my Strip Dist. spouse."}
{"text":"Came here for a highly recommended lunch but opted for their breakfast option upon arrival. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were absolutely most watering with every bite a fluffy cake imbued with blueberries and ricotta create a comforting savory feeling. I also ordered a MTO omelet which was well played and dressed with their chef specialty Basil Jalepeno Aioli! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I wait in line for food around 1:00 on a Saturday. I hear an employee talking about how business has been slow. I look at the chalkboard and see an omelette special in the menu. Past experience and the reviews tell me that thats the thing to get. I order it ... And they are not serving breakfast anymore. On a Saturday. In the Strip. Where the lines for brunch/breakfast are out the door at Marty's Market (rated a top breakfast in PGH), Delucca's and Pamela's. Really? So I guess business has been slow for a reason. They turn away customers here while their competitors have lines out the door."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a cafe and really feels like it. The atmosphere is nice and light and doesn't have the greasy feel of a diner. 

We decided to go here instead of the usual Pamelas or even the other hyped Cocoa cafe (which is actually quite good also). This place didn't have any wait - it was self-seating and we were able to place our order quickly at the front.

The French toast I had was really refreshing. A strange description to use with French toast, but it is the only way to describe it. Unlike more traditional French toast, it feels less eggy and instead focuses on berries - there's a berry compote spread on it (no need for maple syrup) and has a sprinkling of blackberries and powdered sugar. I didn't feel comatose afterwards and was able to easily stroll around the strip."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is a great little cafe for breakfast and lunch. It is our go to when we want to do lunch/brunch in the strip. Love the pancakes!! Made from scratch with fresh blueberries and ricotta cheese mixed into the batter. Best in town hands down! I also love their breakfast sandwiches. If your in the mood for lunch their salads are huge and full of a ton of fresh ingredients. The Nicoise is my fav! My boyfriend loves their sandwiches. Staff is always friendly and service is fast. All they need is alcohol and the place is perfect!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. No line at 11am which was nice. We had salmon sandwich, egg and cheddar on croissant, apple pancakes and a BLT. All were very good. We would stop in again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. We were there on a busy Saturday morning, and that didn't seem to slow down the service or the friendly attitude of the staff.  I had a made to order omelette that was excellent, the potatoes on the side where a little dry because I assume they were cooked and then reheated?  Other than that my meal was great.  My wife had a chicken salad that looked excellent and was a nice serving size, everything was fresh and tasty.  It was hard to pass up the signature blueberry ricotta pancakes, but it seems no matter what you order it's going to be pretty darn good.  It's nice to see that they've expanded into a bigger store room with more seating.  I walk by the place frequently on Saturday mornings, and it's full every time I go by!"}
{"text":"First time yelp poster but felt compelled after this meal.  I've travelled to every state, 10 foreign countries and can confidently say cafe Raymond serves the best quiche hands down.  Light, flavorful with a flaky crust that has just a touch of sweet...   And don't get me started on the French toast.  Insane. If you don't eat here you are missing out."}
{"text":"Raymond knows  friendly atmosphere, awesome deco, and the food / specials just right to my taste Gracias!!!"}
{"text":"The French toast is just chewy enough. The fresh blueberries on too of it is a really nice touch. The best thing about brunch is the herb roasted potatoes. Get that with everything. Also if you are really hungry, or just want to eat a lot of food, get the ham and cheese croissant."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. My husband got a club sandwich which was fresh and delicious with yummy guacamole and really great bacon. I got the Mediterranean salad which was amazing. I could drink the dressing it was so good. 
The service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"I simply, totally, completely adore Cafe Raymond.  It's a usual breakfast spot for me and one of my best friends.  Everything there is consistently tasty, fresh and wonderful.  Eating local is the best -- and Raymond is no exception to this (general) rule of mine.

Cafe Raymond is not a sit-down-get-served restaurant.  You approach a counter and place your order and shortly thereafter your meal is served to you at a table.  The food is consistently served hot and quickly, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I usually get one of their \"make your own\" omelettes.  The omelettes are big and fluffy, and the contents are fresh and delicious.  The coffee is also consistently very good.  All of the omelettes are served with breakfast potatoes - quartered small roasted red potatoes that are seasoned perfectly.  

I have literally no complaints about Cafe Raymond.  Another favorite is their smoked salmon/capers/cream cheese breakfast sandwich.  Compared to the crowdedness of Pamela's (which I am so over) and DeLuca's (which is great but maybe a little overpopular), there's usually a seat at Raymond (which I don't understand).  Take advantage of this Strip District gem."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast service. Had the made-to-order omelet which was better than expectations. Would come again. Skip the overrated Deluca's and come here"}
{"text":"come to the strip for Cafe Raymond..the secret is still safe. Meaning...the lines and wait aren't ridic like penn ave fish can be... My fave is still the Tom/mozz/pesto sandwich.  Get it to go and it comes w a pickle but no chips.  Eat on site, chips are also served...  Recently I tried the salad that starts w an n...I forget the name but it comes w tuna on it.  It's wonderful too."}
{"text":"I wish I had found this place sooner so I could go more often before I moved away. Pamela's doesn't live up to it's hype. Cafe Raymond is a way better alternative.

My wife and I tried the BLT croissant our first time here which is one of the most amazing sandwiches I've ever had. I don't even like mayonaise, but somehow it works great here. That's since the only thing I've eaten there. For the size it's a little pricey, but we're able to split it for breakfast, usually followed up by a snack at Peace, Love and Little Donuts."}
{"text":"What a cool little place! I was in the Strip this morning with some friends and we wanted to stop in somewhere for brunch. After gawking at the wait for Deluca's and Pamela's, we just stumbled upon this place. While small, we had a zero wait time and some table space- so we decided to stop in. And I'm sooooo glad that we did! The staff were incredibly nice and patient for us to order- which is always a really important factor in determining my overall experience- and the menu was simple and everything sounded so tasty. I initially thought that the items were a bit overpriced (10 bucks for pancakes?), but I cannot complain a bit because everything was incredible. All of us just ended up passing around all of our dishes for everyone else to taste. While I only got a pastry, which was one of the best I have ever had, I tried the blueberry pancakes, the omelette, and potatoes- and I was so impressed. The pancakes were so sweet they tasted like blueberry muffins. All of the food was topped off with a very good cup of coffee. Overall, I loved this place and would recommend the brunch to anyone. I'll have to stop by sometime for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"How come you don't ever hear about this place? It's a cute little deli in the strip that seems to be overshadowed by some of the big names like Deluca's and Pamela's. 

My husband and I didn't feel like waiting a long time at other places so we decided to try out Cafe Raymond since it didn't seem that busy. On the Sunday afternoon that we came here, the dining room was rather empty. Aside from us, there were two other couples dining inside and perhaps two couples dining outside (they have about four tables outside on the sidewalk). Cafe Raymond has a large black board menu that you order from that contains sandwiches, salads, breakfast items and perhaps even a daily special. You place the order, they give you a number and they bring your order out when it's ready. He opted for the Ham & Gruyere and I got the Ciabatta & Lox. Both sandwiches came with a side of potatoes, which we didn't expect. They were generous with both the ham and smoked salmon on our sandwiches, which I feel like not many places do these days. The Ham & Gruyere was not just any old ham and cheese; the croissant, gruyere and mixed greens made it a bit fancy. The Ciabatta & Lox was rather rich with cream cheese and smoked salmon, but the cucumber, tomato, onions and capers cut through the richness, adding fresh flavors. 

Overall, the price is right. Not overly priced and the portions are decent. The flavors are there and you can tell the food is fresh. Definitely a good place to visit when you've got a hankering for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"I love love love this place for breakfast on the weekends. Everything is good! (keep in mind I don't eat meat, so I don't know about all that). Their chocolate croissants are amazing! The chocolate is magical and never hardens, and they are soooo good. I bring everyone here, friends, family, puppies, kittens, pet unicorn, they all love it!"}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond is a great place for breakfast and lunch, but did you know they did dinners? Twice now my girlfriend's office has hired Raymond to do a tasting menu/holiday party and both times I really enjoyed it. The food was fresh and tasty.

Their sandwiches are incredible and I love the big, wooden plates they serve them on. They offer a bunch of gourmet sodas, too. They have a bunch of tasty pastries behind their glass, too.

It gets a bit busy on the weekend and it's often hard to find a seat. Also, last time I was here a woman was snapping a photo of the interior and the chef snapped at her, asking why she was taking photos. It came off as incredibly abrasive and rude, and more than a little awkward. I'm not sure if he was having an off day or what, but you should really encourage interest in your establishment, she obviously was not there to steal any secrets!

Tasty, but a little packed. These days I spend my lunches at either Chicken Latino or Cafe on the Strip but that doesn't mean Cafe Raymond isn't a good choice. Just chill out a bit, Raymond, a photograph or two will probably actually HELP your business."}
{"text":"Amazing french toast.

My husband got something on a croissant that I can't remember, but I had a bite and it was delicious as well.

My only complaint was that I couldn't get a latte with my amazing french toast."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Cafe Raymond's yesterday and it was very good!  I had the veggie mufallatta sandwich and it was was fresh and very tasty.  It was so big that I could only eat half, and took the other half home.  It is small on the inside and gets very crowded at lunch time, but they do have four tables set up outside if you like to dine al fresco."}
{"text":"What a great find! The food was wonderful, the girl at the counter was very helpful and it was a perfect day for an outdoor sidewalk brunch experience. 

I was in town to see a Steelers preseason game with a friend and planned a quick brunch visit with my brother and his wife the next morning. They decided we would go to Pamela's but a Sunday brunch line at Pamela's included about 25 people waiting outside to get in. So we backtracked from where we parked and popped into Cafe Raymond. No wait! The breakfast menu had basics like omelets and breakfast sandwiches but I was torn between the two specials: huevos rancheros and ricotta blueberry pancakes. So, naturally, I got both! I split the pancakes with my brother. 

Our food came out to us rather quickly, about a 10 minute wait, if that. Can't say yum enough! The huevos rancheros: three tortillas layered with three over-easy eggs, topped with salsa, black beans and cheese. NOMS. The herb roasted potatoes served on the side were extremely flavorful. The ricotta pancake was light and fluffy and had the perfect amount of blueberries, topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar! Oh man, I wish I could eat this breakfast every day. 

It was a lovely summer morning to sit outside but for the moment I was inside ordering my meal, I noticed it was quaint and simple. But aside from the great food, the most notable part of my experience was wooden plate my food came on. I have never seen anything quite like that before and really felt it tied the food and the environment all in together. A very memorable experience."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been meaning to try Cafe Raymond for awhile and we finally got around to it on a crisp Sunday morning in December.

Walking into the cafe, we weren't exactly sure if we should seat ourselves or order at the counter, but we quickly figured that out on our own.  By recommendation of the cashier, we ordered both specials...  the Corned Beef Omelette and the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes.  I ordered a coffee as well.

The food came out relatively quickly and was delivered to our table.  My wife's omelette was pretty standard fare, but her home fries were pretty good.  My pancakes were pretty good, but once again, nothing to write home about.  Add in some so-so diner style coffee and Cafe Raymond is a solid breakfast, but not one I'd probably seek out again."}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond KILLS IT.

I honestly don't think I've ever had a better Pastrami Sandwich in my life. It consisted of delicious hot pastrami, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a mustard grain that I will fantasize about later on in my dreams. 

Not to mention Cafe Raymond has awesome bread to add to all of their sandwiches.

If all of their sandwiches are as good as the pastrami sandwich I inhaled, I will come back time and time again, no doubt."}
{"text":"I had the ricotta and apple pancakes with a side of roasted rosemary potatoes at Cafe Raymond yesterday. Incredibly delicious!! The pancakes come with a big scoop of whipped cream so no need for butter. I thought the food would never taste as good as it looked. It didn't! It tasted 8 times better than it looked. His vegetarian muffuletta is a delicious sandwich that I also recommend."}
{"text":"I have worked on the strip for several years now and I made my third visit to Cafe Raymond. This is a cute little stop where you order from a counter and it's delivered to your table. 

I dragged the wife with me a she enjoyed the stop as well. I went with the Italian Muffaletta, not sure of the spelling. The portions are great, the bread is so fresh and it's made to order. The service and staff are really nice. I also go the combo and that included home made pasta salad and a cookie. I recommend this stop for sure. I have added it to my rotation."}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy place to get breakfast. It is small, but very worth the stop. It is intimate and has a very local feel. I got the French toast and it was amazing. My fiancé got the omelet and potatoes, which were also amazing. The eggs were fluffy and the potatoes were perfect texture. The customer service was also amazing. The two ladies at the front were extremely nice and helpful. I am happy to say we found our new go to breakfast and lunch stop when we are in town for hockey games!"}
{"text":"A cute little cafe on the Pittsburg strip. A nice place if you're looking for a filling, yummy, lazy breakfast. But, if you're in a hurry or looking for a quick bite and trying to save your appetite for lunch, I'd suggest giving this place a skip and going for some of the other coffee shops in the area. They have a pretty short menu, and though I only tried the spinach quiche with roasted potatoes, everything looked delicious. I was drooling over the pancakes and french toasts being served at nearby tables. The quiche was tiny, but was very well done and full of flavor. My only concern is that you have to be ready to shell out at least $15 or so for your breakfast and coffee. It would be nice if they had a few more items on their menu and some which were a little more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great find in the Pittsburgh strip district. They have a good balance of breakfast and lunch items, all of which were excellent. My cousin got their breakfast sandwich, which he claims was the best breakfast sandwich of his entire life. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food you can write home about.  Everything is savory and delicious.  It's a different experience than a breakfast place like Pamela's, the food is very sophisticated and not too sweet.  I do like that I can go right to the counter and order my food, it seems to come a lot faster that way.  Their pan potatoes are the best in the city."}
{"text":"Cute, little cafe in the heart of the strip district. Very small inside space with only a few tables. Come early if you want a table. Order at the counter and they will bring your meal to the table. From the menu, you can tell that CR values quality ingredients. Much better selections than other nearby brunch spots. I ordered the ricotta, blueberry pancakes. They may have been the fluffiest pancakes, I've ever eaten. Overall, a great place to grab breakfast or brunch when down in the strip."}
{"text":"Small cafe that surprisingly accepts credit cards.ordering was simple and our orders came out promptly.
French toast-I would have liked these to be a little more fluffier and softer.the beat part is the berry mix puree they put on the french toast instead of syrup-unique,not very sweet and healthier-love it!
Turkey club-nothing to write home about but the home fries are to die for-so well baked and the seasoning is amazing on these
Things they can improve on-maybe for the price increase portion sizes.I was left a bit hungry although turkey club at most places leaves me too full or I am not able to finish it.
Maybe have a printed menu so people can decide sitting on their table.its kind of not easy to linger around the menu board in a small cramped up cafe reading off the chalk board.
But overall good service and food.I would rate them higher than Pamela and deluca-those 2 places are sooooo over rated!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Friday while getting some groceries in the strip.  when you enter the smell is amazing!  The food was fresh, and delicious.  The bread was really great too!  I had a veggie Mufflata.  I had never seen anyone make one before, and was happy to try something new.  It was great!  Huge!  Tasty! And the olive tapenade was great! The only thing I did't like, which may be my own opinion, was the eggplant wasn't cooked enough for me.  It need another few minutes to soften up.  Overall I enjoyed this lunch stop and will be going back to try some other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I stopped into Cafe Raymond with my parents for breakfast when they visited town last Sat.  My original plan was to take them to DeLuca's, but unsurprisingly, the line was long. Since I hadn't been to Cafe Raymond before, I figured this was as good of a reason as any to stop by, so I suggested it and we headed in.  Although it was fairly busy even here, I was able to snag a table while they ordered, so we were able to tuck in as soon as our orders came up.

We ordered the following items: blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes for me ($8.99); blueberry French toast for my mom ($8.99), and cheddar cheese omelette for my dad ($8.99).  Despite seeming thick, the pancakes were surprisingly light and fluffy because of the ricotta, and the lemon added a delicious tang.  Even without the syrup, they were very tasty, but the syrup added some nice moisture.  My mom let me try a bite of the French toast, and the bread was light, but had a nice crunch.  The star of the show was the compote, however, which was just sweet enough--not overly so--and showcased the ripe fruit.  I didn't try my dad's omelette, but he said it was also quite fluffy, and was filled with a decent amount of cheese.  As can be seen from the photos, the presentation was also quite nice, a welcome change from the norm at many diners.

The staff were also quite friendly, and were prompt about wiping off our table after my mom spilled some coffee on it.  While the prices are a bit steep, I think they're warranted, given the sophistication of the food and that credit cards are accepted.  Overall, I'd say that Cafe Raymond has one of the best breakfasts in the Strip (hence my rating), so don't hesitate to stop by and try it if the lines at the competition are too long, or if you're looking for something different than the usual.  I look forward to dropping in again soon to try one of the lunch items such as the tomato mozzarella sandwich."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Strip District in awhile but I'm glad I revisited the area. I was down there for a meeting, and my manager and I were thinking of places to grab something to eat for lunch that served sandwiches & salads. Café Raymond was the perfect place to visit because they have a great selection of both.

All of the ingredients seemed fresh and there was just about anything for everyone: meat, greens, pastries, etc. 

One of my favorite things to enjoy in the summer is a great tomato & mozzarella salad and this place had an amazing one. I thought it was going to be something tiny but the portion size was huge.

The workers were very nice and courteous. They told us to take a seat inside or outside and that they would bring our meals to us. We decided to eat outside since it was a nice day out. They brought our meals to us but also came outside and cleaned it up! Even brought out a to-go box for my manager. Very good service.

Definitely will go back. I recommend it if you're looking for a place that offers timely service for a fresh, filling meal."}
{"text":"Ricotta pancakes were so good. Looked busy but ordered at counter and seating opened up quickly."}
{"text":"I was just not impressed. We went for brunch one morning, and I was excited to try their sweet plates. You first order at the counter, you receive a number, and your plate is brought to you.

I got the French Toast with Raspberry Compote, and he got the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes. If I had to choose: pancakes were better than the french toast. The french toast was lacking any fluffiness inside and consistency was hard and chewy. The compote was tasty, though.

Maybe sandwiches are a better bet? I thought the prices were a little steep, especially considering the atmosphere and lack of table service."}
{"text":"I really like this place - it's a great alternative to the standard fare that you'd get at Pamela's and DeLuca's.  There is rarely a wait for a table (seat yourself) and the food is high quality and not greasy or too cheesy.  I have always been happy with my breakfast - I like to try the omelet of the day and/or the pancake special.  Today was Southwestern Omelet and it was awesome!!  Give Cafe Raymond a try the next time you are contemplating waiting in line at the other two bfast places close nearby."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a friend here recently and the positive previews don't lie.  I ordered the Veggie Muffaleta sandwich which contained warm grilled veggies (portabella, zucchini, red pepers, eggplant) between pillow soft ciabatta bread.  Seriously, I could have slept on the bread it was so fluffy and perfect...I mean the sandwich didn't even really need the veggie stuffing - the bread alone would have been sufficient.  

I think it can be tough to get veggie sandwiches right but Cafe Raymond knows what it's doing.  My only issue was the eggplant which was firmer than I would have liked but eggplant is tough to get right, especially in sandwiches.  It's like the Goldilocks of vegetables...too firm or too mushy, it's tough to get it just right!  

The generous sized sandwich was served with crispy potato chips and a pickle spear.  My friend and I split a fig and pistachio baklava which was fantastic.  I would highly recommend this place for folks looking to get a solid sandwich and maybe some bedding made out of bread."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am a sandwich fanatic. I'm most likely to order the token sandwich/burger at any pub, restaurant, or bistro. Discovering Cafe Raymond was like a pilgrimage to the sandwich holy land. 

Owner Ray knows exactly what he is doing when he builds those beautiful masterpieces between fresh bread. The menu may seem standard, but the sandwiches are anything but. My favorites include the Club, and BLT. Both sport fantastically thick slices of bacon, and irresistible homemade mayo. 

Be sure to stop by on Thursdays or Fridays. Every Thursday, Ray makes a limited quantity of specialty hamburgers. The patties are a beef, bacon hybrid, and rival the best local burger joints. Friday specials tend to be grilled cheeses lovingly tucked between pillowy slices of brioche. Just writing this is making my mouth water. 

Cafe Raymond also serves breakfast on certain mornings. I've never made it down for that, but legend has it the fare is delightful. It can get crazy in there around standard lunch hours--I recommend stopping by a little before noon or after 1 if you want to avoid the crowd. 

From the outside, it may look like a standard sandwich shop tucked in the Strip, but I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I stopped by here two days ago with my father for lunch.  We had walked by here a number of times before and the items listed on their chalkboard on the sidewalk always looked good but for some reason we had never stopped.  There's not much to the inside of this place as there is a large chalkboard menu above where you order along with some coolers on one side and some shelves on the other and then a couple of tables where you can sit.  There are also 5 or 6 tables out on the sidewalk along Penn Ave that you can sit at.  After you order and pay, you are given a number and are allowed to seat yourself.  Since it was extremely nice outside on the day that we visited,my father and I proceeded outside and enjoyed our lunch there.

For my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken caesar salad while my father went with the pastrami sandwich.  A salad isn't normally what I would order whenever I was going out and is often tougher to write a Yelp review on but I was attempting to eat a little bit healthier that day.  After only a short wait our food came out to us and I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with how it looked.  The chicken caesar salad was plated nicely with a mound of romaine lettuce topped with a ton of grated parmesan cheese and then a chicken breast cut thin lengthwise and symmetrically placed on top of the romaine.  It's dressing ended up coming on the side and while there wasn't a lot of it, it had a pretty good flavor.  The salad ended up being exactly what I expected with the chicken being somewhat moist and all of the greens looking good.  My dad ended up enjoying his sandwich and during our lunch commented about how much meat there was on it.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While my salad was everything that I expected out of it, I think that the next time that I come here that I am going to have to try one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"How have I never eaten here?  Cafe Raymond is a very strong contender for the best sandwich place in Pittsburgh, possibly the tri-state area, or the country. I may dress as a Cafe Raymond sandwich for Halloween just so I can talk about how great it is.

I had the tomato mozzarella sandwich that had probably the best pesto sauce known to man spread on it.  And the bread.  Wow.  The bread was absolutely amazing.  Is it lunchtime again yet?  I'll be here again soon.

I'm so surprised that this gem of a place is as small as it is.  Located on Penn Avenue in the Strip District it is an unassuming little cafe, that on a Thursday at lunchtime was busy, but not completely packed.  I can't wait to go back - and I want to try other menu items - but am so in love with the fresh tomato mozzarella sandwich that I may not be able to try another item!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the strip. Fresh and tasty. Currently moving to another location with more seating which would be my only suggestion."}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot believe that I've lived in PIttsburgh for nine years and haven't been here for breakfast.

Me and my mother were looking for a spot to eat in the Strip and decided to give Cafe Raymond a try. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. We each ordered and devoured the blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes that were on special that morning. There were chunks (yes chunks) of fresh ricotta in almost every bite. The pancakes were fluffy clouds of deliciousness.

There is some outdoor seating, although I suggest sitting inside as the sidewalk gets extremely busy. Also, you order and pay for your food at the counter.

-1 star for look/feel of space. This is definitely the reason why I hadn't been here before. Could use a bit of TLC."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Probably my favorite place to eat lunch in all of Pittsburgh.  Yesterday I was there for lunch, which has become a common occurrence, and I told Raymond \"not to change anything\".  With a facial expression that said \"Who the hell are you?\", he responded \"I wouldn't.\"  You gotta love when people do things not to please others, but to please themselves; and when doing so actually pleases us at the same time.  Consider calling in your order to-go because seating is usually on short supply.   Monday they are closed."}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond is one of my favorite places to eat, hands down. I've never been for brunch, but their lunches are amazing. I don't even like BLT's, but their BLT is probably what I would order for my last meal. The thick cut bacon balanced with the other ingredients is absolutely perfect. The salads are large and very tasty too. I also really like the prosciutto sandwich and the veggie. We had our company picnic catered by Ray and he did an outstanding job. The food was great and all the details were taken care of. I highly recommend you stop by for lunch or consider Cafe Raymond the next time you need catering."}
{"text":"3.5* Rounded up for the friendly service with a smile!

Café Raymond was one of the lesser busy places on The Strip to grab breakfast/brunch.  In fact, contrary to the other places, there was not a ridic queue outside.  Not sure how you feel about that, but I don't like the idea of lining up...to eat.

Average price seemed to be ~$10 for most breakfast/sandwich items.  I got the Veg Muffaletta - I think it was just under $8 - and it was absolutely HUGE.  Again, I shared just about everything that I ordered while I was in Pittsburgh and 1 portion seemed more suitable for 2ppl.  Grilled veggies in sandwich were still juicy and focaccia was nice 'n fluffy, but toasted.

A decent, solid place to grab a quick bite to eat.  However, it didn't seem like a place that lends itself to lingering.

Now looking at the photos on Yelp, I wished that I had ordered something sweet!  :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop at on the strip. The only catch is that their hours are limited, so it's only opened for lunch during the week, and for breakfast and lunch on the weekends. Usually on Thursdays, they do some kind of burger special. I got the bacon cheeseburger the day I stopped in. The bacon was perfect, nicely cooked and thickly sliced. You could tell the burger was freshly grounded. Comes with a side of chips too. I'm hoping to try their brunch/breakfast one of these days!"}
{"text":"Now, before you judge me for only giving this place three stars, you must understand that Pittsburgh's Strip District is known for the fresh and amazing foods. So, in an area where you can get a quarter of a delicious pizza for a few bucks, delicious teriyaki chicken skewers along the street, oysters by the shell, etc., etc. (this is my obligatory foodie Strip District circle jerk), my standards for this area are the very highest.

Cafe Raymond is not a letdown. It's just, as Yelp invites me to review, \"A-OK.\" I had the salmon omelet special (smoked salmon and cream cheese in an omelet covered with scallions). The eggs were fresh and the lox were flavorful, and I couldn't have a better appetizer with some biscotti (Pistachio is my favorite) and coffee. The coffee was a little burnt, but these things happen.

My recommendation: check out some of the perfect places that this area has to offer, and if you keep coming back, stop in. It's a little too expensive for me, but I'll probably go back because they're nice people and have pistachio biscotti. A-OK."}
{"text":"I had the blueberry lemon pancakes. The taste was good but I think the pancake was too thick and which the texture in between a little weird. The other disappointment is that they only serve regular coffee, no latte ...
I didn't eat the BLT sandwich but I saw a couple of people ordering that and it looked very good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure in the lovely Strip District of Pittsburgh.  We stumbled upon this restaurant after seeing the long line to get into DeLucas.  Cafe Raymond did not have a line but the food was fresh and a lot better.  We had a sandwich with lox that was fantastic and the blueberry pancakes with ricotta which were great too.  The food was great and the service was friendly and prompt.  You gotta love it.  If you want horrible service then make a trip down to the Pittsburgh Popcorn company.  Their service is hideous."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the BLT, but when it is this perfect, that's all you need! Just made croissant, perfect bacon, lettuce and tomato. Should absolutely be on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate.\""}
{"text":"This place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, especially for Sunday brunch. There were still enough customers to keep most of the tables occupied though. I didn't like the concept of having to order at the counter because I didn't like having to make my decision of what to order under pressure, as there was a line forming behind us. I ended up hastily choosing the French toast. Boyfriend got the BLT. You can help yourself to tap water, which I tried to do, but the pitcher was empty and had to be brought to the counter for them to refill. (I know they are busy, but honestly water is pretty important and they need to find a better way to dispense water if they can't be attentive to the pitcher.) The table we sat at had crumbs on it from the previous diners and the knife and fork given to me for my French toast looked dirty. 

Luckily, my French toast with berry compote was good. I also loved the way the home fries that came with the BLT were seasoned. 

This place does have good brunch food, so if you don't feel like waiting in the long line at Pamela's around the corner, try Cafe Raymond, but don't have high expectations for service or cleanliness.

{"text":"This is an amazing deli/cafe.  Nothing is not delicious here.  I have eaten my way through the entire regular sandwich menu, and I love every one of them.  Plus they have Boylan's Cane Cola, which is the best soda ever.

If there weren't so many good places to get lunch in the Strip, I would eat lunch here every week.  

The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that, because it is awesome, it can be insanely crowded, and you have to kind of fight a little bit with your elbows sometimes in order to find a place to sit down."}
{"text":"One of my brothers is named Raymond so wanted to check this place out. Cheesy but of course wanted to make sure that this cafe did the name proud! Nice place in the Strip to grab a bite to eat for lunch and breakfast. Reasonably priced with sandwiches and some breakfast items. Grabbed brunch here on a Sunday around noon (closes at 1:30) and it wasn't packed which was great. Ordered the french toast and lox ciabatta sandwich plus two coffees (came to about $21-$22). Everything tasted fresh and the service was friendly and prompt. Would return here though they only offer bottled water in case you're thirsty. Outdoor and indoor seating though space is small yet cozy for inside."}
{"text":"What I thought was just a little cafe, turns out to be awesome.   The Raymond burger is nothing short of amazing.      It is a little cramped inside but it is worth it.   

Cafe Raymond is definitely saved to my favorites!"}
{"text":"Very, very happy employees.  I would say that is my first impression.

Second impression is that I had one good-looking pepper and pesto omlette with mozzarela cheese that was cooked to perfection and piping hot.

It was Easter Sunday, everything except Deluccas appeared to be closed and I wandered in to Raymond almost by accident.  It was a happy, happy accident.

The space is, um, intimate (read:  tight) but it didn't bother me.  I've been here a few times and always find it a great, if casual, place to go for lunch or breakfast.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are a hard sell for me.  They've really got to impress me.  Even, let's say, razzle dazzle me.  Anyone can slap together two slices of bread, some cheese and meat.  But can it always taste good?  I'm afraid not.  

I'd passed Cafe Raymond a million times and never gone in.  It's just a small unassuming deli in the midst of the bustling Strip District.  But recently I kept saying to myself: \"self, you must go in there next time.\"  That next time turned into today... And I was not sorry!

I'm a big fan of tomato and mozzarella salads, but I'm always hasty to order it when tomatoes aren't in season.  So I had to ask today, and the server assured me they were nice and fresh.  So I was super excited to order the caprese type salad.  All I said at the counter was \"tomato and mozz\" and I instead received a sandwich.  I'm not one to complain (too much at least), so I scooped it up and plopped down to mangia.

Good thing I screwed my order up because that ciabatta bread was life changing.  As soon as I bit in I knew it was freshly made.  I was confirmed by the nice worker, who said the owner Raymond freshly bakes all the breads except for the rye.  I'd eat those freshly baked loaves of bread to oompa loompa status if I worked there!  

Thankfully the tomatoes were fresh as promised, with the same fresh mozzarella and a delish grain mustard.  I can only imagine how scrumptious the other sammie choices are.  I can say confidently I will never be able to walk past Cafe Raymond again without devouring something inside... Maybe the whole bread tray..."}
