{"text":"This restaurant serves worst type of afghan good. This is NOT how an afghan kabob or rice is cooked. However, The restaurant is located right across from Canada's wonderland so it is convenient to walk across to enjoy some afghan cuisine. Although You have to pay right after ordering. The cashier brings out the food because the place is never too busy. All meals come with salad and naan. It takes 15-20 mins to bring out the food. I ordered waziri kabob with rice which is basically one skewer chicken breast and one skewer of ground beef for the price of 12.99 plus tax. I must add I am an afghan and this is NOT how afghan kabob and rice taste like. I am very very disappointed. The rice is boiled and drained to dry, The rice has no seasoning. The chicken breast is fully cooked and nicely seasoned. However the sheesh kabob was medium rare and is absolutely no seasoning whatsoever, it is dry and has weird smell to it. The salad is washed well. The naan is served  fresh. The side sauces were ranch and some sort of veg. Grounded pickle. Being it an afghan restaurant I was hoping for some afghan songs in the overhead but instead it was local radio station playing. I will never be returning to this restaurant. This restaurant deliveries food that is not afghan food."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times with co-workers and have tried Waziri kabab, Burg kabab and more recently tandoori chicken. Over all the food is very good and fresh. The naan was amazing and made fresh to order.   The decor is simple with plenty of seating. The restaurant is very clean and wash rooms were clean as well. Not sure what another yelper is talking about."}
{"text":"I came in with my family to try out this restaurant for the first time. The food was delicious and the service was excellent! We were very satisfied with everything. We would definitely come back!! As for the previous comment.. i definitely did not sense any horrible smell in the hallway or anywhere. So that information is definitely wrong! But definitely a pleasant experience and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I travel  back and forth from barrie  to Toronto on regular basis and I often stop by vaughn to look for halal  food. Since I found sultan kebab, that is the only halal  kebab store I stop. They have a very warm welcoming environment and very friendly  staff. They have a  Hugh  selection  of  different  foods and I have tried almost all of them and they are all delicious. Even for my business we always use them for our catering. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good portions. Clean place and nice to be in. One of the best middle eastern places I've been to recently. With that said, I went three times a few months ago and the wait for the food was long (25min) but tolerable. I would call ahead to place my order next time but they need to hire more ppl. Other than that, i never smelled anything weird there as S.T. says, seems he's just hatin'"}
{"text":"The food already cooking was a pleasant aroma to walk into.  There is a walk up counter to order at when you arrive. It's a pretty big place, with lots of seating.   The food took about 10 to 15 minutes to prepare. It was fresh and hot and we had to pick it up at the counter. The food was good tasting and the naan was quite soft and tasted great. My order was a chicken with salad which consisted of regular lettuce and a few shavings of purple cabbage. Along side there was a finely chopped up tomato. I didn't order the plate with rice, as having the naan was filling enough. The plate was a good skewer sized chicken, a lot bigger pieces than I had expected. Chicken was juicy and had a good flavour.  The dish came with 2 side sauces, one spice kind of tomato, the other a  sweeter creamy sauce.  Both went well with the chicken.  Cost about $55 for a family of 4."}
{"text":"What a waste of my time and money!!!!!!!  Walking in the front door I see a pile of dirty dishes.  Why would they place the garbage right at the front door.  The dining area was dark and dingy, and a bit odd in terms of size.  It's not a full service restaurant...you go to the takeout counter to place your order and then find a table to sit down at.  Strange how big the dining room is for horrible takeout food.  Now let's talk about the food.  I asked if they had any curries and she said \"yes we have chicken korma\".  So I order the beef skewer and the chicken korma side order for takeout.  She said it came with salad and naan.    While driving home I didn't smell much goodness.  In fact I was shocked that there was little aroma, which is not a good sign. Fresh cooked food with spices should always smell good.  When i arrived home I first opened the little styrofoam container of korma.  My immediate thought..\"what the f*ck  is that\"!!!  There was no sauce...what kind of curry is that.  And looking at it, it appears to be left over deep fried chicken mixed up.  Each piece was random in size and the fry batter was not even on each piece.  It literally looks like leftover mix of crap! I took one bite and spat it out!!! I brought the container to my nose and serious??? It smelled bad!!!  I opened the other contained and it looked decent.  Good portion and the salad looked really fresh.  I ate the salad first and then when I cut a piece of the beef...omg!  It was tough and dry and when I took the bite, it was completely cold.   And when I cut through the rice with my fork, it was obvious the rice was microwaved. The rice was chunked together.  My entire meal was microwaved!!! It was luke warm and nothing but salty.  The naan was obviously re toasted and stale.  Even the sauce they served with the dinner was gross.  Not sure what the creamy one is...shouldn't it be a yogurt....well it tasted like sour ranch dressing.  And the tomato based sauce, it was so acidic.  Think they gave me 3 week old sauce.  Aside from the salad, I took 6 bites and threw my dinner away.  Ok and now service...what service.  And it's really gross when the person taking your order looks in need of a shower.  And the kitchen staff that looked out the window looked even worse.    Not sure how or why people gave this place some good ratings but lesson learned...when you walk in a restaurant that looks like that...you should just walk out!"}
{"text":"after doing some shopping at the mall. to find a place to eat some delicious  afghan food. come to sultan kabob.  we came with our family. i really recommend  it to every one...the people are very friendly  and the food is amazing...very clean and i am very happy with the customer service. good job  guys.... ..abby.."}
{"text":"Great food, tried their tikka, waziri and half chicken during my stay in Toronto, a restaurant has to be that good to bring me back so many times :-)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I've been here a handful of times since they've opened up in my neighbourhood. Delicious and sizeable portions. The Tandoori chicken is especially tasty. Tonight's visit with the family was especially memorable. They were very busy tonight and food was taking a bit longer than usual to get out.  The staff (a very nice young lady) decided to make up for that by serving the salad portion of the meal in advance. This is usually served together with the main platter of food. They also unexpectedly prepared some free appetizers for us while we waited. That small gesture proved that this place is special and definitely worth a visit if you're feeling for this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"No idea what Afghan food tastes like but this places food was excellent! Myself and my SO went here for dinner.  I had the Tandoori Kebob and her the Tikka Kebob.  The place is incredibly clean (no idea what smell some other people mentioned), the cashier very friendly, and the food was very well cooked.  The chicken was incredibly juicy and tender, while the beef was delicious.  I don't live far from this place and will definitely be back.  I guess if you know what Afghan food tastes like you may not like this place but if you are just looking for some savory middle-eastern style food, this place is it!"}
{"text":"Very good juicy meat and great value for your money. The chicken and beef were grilled to perfection. Bread was good too and served warm. Something to improve on - they only have plastic utensils."}
{"text":"Clean bright restaurant with lots of seating by the window. It takes about 10 minutes to get food. Very tasty food."}
{"text":"Update from my last review, this restaurant is now permanently closed. Disappointing, their kabobs were very good, far superior than Bamiyan Kabob."}
{"text":"We stopped here after going to Wonderland. I had a kabob that was very good. They were pretty nice and stayed open a little later for us so we could eat. I enjoyed the kabob that I had. I would recommend it to people looking for somewhere to eat close to wonderland."}
{"text":"YES. After a long day at wonderland, we were starving. Incredible food, the extremely long, crowded line was a pain but food was worth it."}
{"text":"Came here one night after work with my Fiancée.  Not much service as you go to the front and order what you'd like and then sit down and wait to be called. The girl who was taking our order wasn't very friendly nor did she speak much English which was ok since we knew what we wanted. We got the Waziri combo and the Chicken breast combo. I got salad and bread with the chicken breast and my fiancée got rice as well.   The salad was the best part of the meal. My fiancée said the rice was OK but our chicken was raw! we had to show the owner how raw it was and he offered to make us new ones but by then we had lost our appetites. The owner or manager was extremely nice and apologetic for the food being undercooked and gave us free meal vouchers on our next visit. Needless to say we will not be coming back.  OMG, I almost forgot to mention was that the hallway by the bathrooms has the most horrific smell you could ever smell. The restaurant in general has a weird smell but that hallway would make anybody loose their appetite. Be warned!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, location is nice and a bit better than the average Persian/afghan/middle eastern joint. Think Swiss chalet nice.  Only thing I didn't love is ordering at the counter and paying before eating...Even though the staff were nice enough to bring the food to our table ... I think this place would make a great sit down restaurant where you have a server taking care of you.  Food tasted great, and was freshly made (did take about 15-20 mins).  Overall, I would recommend this for a casual bite if not in a rush."}
{"text":"The BEST place to waste your money for a very bad quality food and customer service.  A second time visit after my first one back in 2011. Back then, both 2 pieces of Chapli kabas were not of the same size, not well cooked and on top, naan was small in size compared to similar kaba places like Bamiyan and Naan & Kabob.  Yesterday, along with my family, I gave it a try again i.e June 3 2017; 08:40 PM. THE Worst experience.  Firstly, the attendant was unattentive. Secondly, the food was ready around 09:12 PM. We were not informed of their closing time at 09:30 PM, as she packed our eatables and I was surprised. Thridly, I paid for my 3 pops and when asked for my drinks, I was attempted to be charged again. I reminded and presented my receipt. Fourthly, I told her of my disappointment. The attendant did not apologize, adding frustration to my situation, why did I go that place. Fifth, the owner was aware of everything but she pretended as if she didn't see anything. Sixth, tandoori chicken pieces had a bad aroma while eating and kabobs were without salt. Seventh, I asked for their tiny little sauce. Attendant took 3 seconds to respond asked how many. Awsome !  Eight, we've an upset stomach now, sitting at home and repenting, cursing at myself, why did I take my family to this place.  Please make a wise decision when visiting restaurants. Avoid any rookie eat-out places. Your money is a hard earning and do not want to flush it off for unvaluable items."}
{"text":"I usually go to bamiyan kabob for any afghani food, but I was in the area and decided to try this place. The menu and selections are good, different dishes to choose from. I ordered exactly at 9:12pm, and did not get my food until 9:44pm, I kid you not. They are extremely understaffed, especially at the front counter, only having 1 girl to take orders, give the food to waiting customers AND provide service for any customers that need any excess things. If you are coming to eat here in the evening on the weekend, I highly recommend to prepare yourself to wait for at least 20 minutes. I got the food, and I was really impressed with the bread. It is thick, crusty on the outside, soft and hot on the inside; you could tell it just came out of the oven. The chicken breast I ordered was tasty and the kabob I ordered was ok,but pretty small. I've eaten better. Overall, If you are an impatient person, do not come here. It's okay if there is nothing else in the area. Wouldn't come back, though."}
{"text":"I am disappointed with my first time experience at Sultan Kabob. I was waiting in line for over 25 minutes to make my order when there were only 4 customers ahead of me. This was because there was only one worker working at cashier. But haha not only was she cashiering, she was calling orders for people's food, putting in final touches on plates and going back to the kitchen doing God knows what. After waiting in line for over 25 minutes, I finally had the chance to make my order. I couldn't even finish my order because I was interrupted when the lady left to go call out another order and fix up a plate. Also, I was wondering if I could pay in american dollars, so I ask the cashier and here's how it goes:  Me: Am I allowed to pay with Ameria- Cashier: No, we do not allowed American Express  I wasn't even asking to pay with American Express???   After I finally paid for my order, I had the chance to sit down. My feet were sore from standing for so long. I went to the washroom and might I say, it was not it good condition. Extremely dirty, toilet paper all over the ground, utterly disgusting. However, I can't complain about the food, it was good. But they need more workers so service is faster and customers are not waiting in line for 20+ minutes to purchase a can of pop."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but literally had to wait 10 minutes to order. It wasn't even like I had people in front of me, It was my time to order and the lady working the cashier was also pretty much doing everything else (setting up the plates, calling out the orders). Prices were inexpensive and can't really complain about much but the wait. Still imagine having to wait 10+ minutes just to order a wrap and you're the first person in line... Very annoying"}
{"text":"Places like this upset me.   Afghani food is usually flavourful tender meats with aromatic tasty rice and this place is none of that.   Meats over cooked, rice flavourless, it doesn't taste like anything, service is slow and no TP in washrooms.   Why be in business if you're not even going to try?????"}
{"text":"Came in at 8pm on a Friday night. Was surprised to see that the place was empty. Great menu with a lot of variety. I had the tandoori chicken with salad and rice. Portion size was perfect and the food was delicious. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews I decided to check this place out for myself. walked in slight smoke in the air but no bad odor, I actually liked the smell of the food being cooked.  I did not know it was a take out counter type place, that being said the food was freshly prepared (hence there is a wait time). Chicken was tender, salad fresh, rice was good and not overly seasoned and naan was untraditionally thick but good. Portion size was ample but not huge. Overall, I would compare this place to Bamiyan Kabob but have not tried may items yet to compare more than the chicken. I would definitely return and have now found a new place to eat."}
{"text":"Was craving some afghani food, remembered this place being good, decided to stop by to dine in for the first time. (Last time was delivery).   At 8pm on a Friday evening it was empty. But remembering how good the food was last time and not having to wait in line was a win-win for me!   Ordered the Chapli kabob and chicken kabob for the wife. Both were delicious, fresh and cooked perfectly.   This place is 2 for 2 in my books and will continue to get my business!"}
