{"text":"Good food, cold drinks at reasonable prices. BUT.... there's only 1 cook and 1 bartender. The bartender has to sling drinks and food to the entire place so service is extremely slooooowww........."}
{"text":"I'm local to the area and had moved here a bit over a year ago! Some neighbors invited us out to this local Irish Pub on St. Patrick's day... Man what a treat! The beer flowed freely, the servers were wonderful and as the night progressed my belly rumbled. Now here comes the great part... I figured just bar finger food would be available but nope not the case at all. I ordered the fish n' chips and was floored... perfectly battered and fried with real substance and the \"chips\" what we Americano's know as fires were done just right man was I surprised and and delighted! I left that night full of great food, cold good beer, a couple Irish car bombs and smiles. Thank you to the owners who know how to feed a man well and give him a good beer! I'll definitely be back for more at my new favorite Irish pub!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible from the moment I walked in, rude and very bad staff. I sat and waited for friends to come and felt alienated and almost like it was an inconvenience for me to be there. When friends arrived they got wings, they were just okay. Smoke fills this place and I mean it's terrible. A second staff member whom I was going to order food from I asked which wings were good and stated \"are you kidding me!\" \"All our food is good\". So I didn't order anything because he was rude and ignorant. Waiting for our bill was another thing because we left and went to legacy lanes which is right across the street and 1000 times better for hospitality, food and smoke free!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible wings.  I have had every flavor and they are all great, although the regular Buffalo are my favorite.  They also have great homemade ranch.  The place is a little rundown inside, but the great food and drinks more than makes up for it."}
