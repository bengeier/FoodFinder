{"text":"Gabby's is Betty's Poor cousin. 

If you have been to Betty's, you know what I mean."}
{"text":"A menu and brand that poorly rips off Jack Astor's.  Awful service, and warm disgusting beer was the special of the day.  We walked out after our server forgot we were there.  Will never go back to this hole - there are much better options in this city.  Walk a block in any direction to find one."}
{"text":"I came here after a sightseeing day yesterday with family.  They wanted to come because of the wings and the great experience.  They were absolutely right.  We had half priced wings.  The service was great.  The wings came out hot and were so good.  I got the honey garlic based on the recommendation from our server.  The beer was great as well.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to school across the street from this place for 3 years .  From previous reviews, I know that the opinion of most students that attend GBC are well, not the best. Anyways, this summer I found myself a returning student to GBC for another year of torture, also known as school. 

Anywho, for this whole time I have never ventured to Gabby's. Not once. Yes, I walk by it every time I'm at school, and have received countless invitations from friends to join them for after school drinks, but it has just never appealed to me for two reasons:

1- This particular area of Toronto is FULL of great bars and pubs where to get an after school or work drink.  
2- If I want food, St.Lawrence Market up the street! OR there are hundreds of other restaurants in this area.

But today, after a final exam that almost made me cry, some school mates invited to Gabby's so we could commiserate about the exam from hell that was given to us by our heartless professor, and I accepted. 

First impression: This place is a regular, run of the mill bar. It is pretty dark in there which I appreciated, as it made me feel better about my plans to drown my sorrows on a pitcher of beer so early in the day. We took the biggest table they had and ordered our drinks.  The waitress looked at me suspiciously and then carded me, which made me feel great, specially since I was the oldest in the group by like 4 years. 

I was about 2/3 into my Stella when I saw the little drink menu on the table with the daily specials. Thursdays = $2.25 beer mugs.  I asked the waitress what beers were offered on the special and she told us Coors Light and Canadian. Not my choice of beers, but at $2.25, I wasn't going to say no. I ended up having 2 mugs, plus that Stella and it all came to less than $10.00! 

I don't particularly like Gabby's at all really, but its a good option for cheap beers (as long as you don't mind their only 2 choices). 
So will I be returning? Probably only after another exam, when all I want is a cheap beer with friends. Oh, before I forget, our waitress was really nice and did not mind at all that we all wanted separate bills :)"}
{"text":"I go to school across the street so I've been here more times then I want to admit. But everytime I leave here I feel so dirty and dissatisfied. The whole place smells like a toilet, the staff is inattentive and rude, the food is greasy and gross, and the beers taste like the keg lines havent been cleaned in ages.

My friends and I have stopped going to Gabby's after discovering broken glass in our tequila shots! There was no apology or any kind of service recovery, not to mention, that we still had to pay for those tainted shots.

Be careful and drink there at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Great place! I've been here on Wednes-Wings day with my family after a long sightseeing day. The wings, the service, the beer... everything is great and just what you expect from a pub style diner. They definitely deserve more stars!"}
{"text":"I completely expected this day to come, just not so soon.  I went to Gabby's on King E across from George Brown College after spending the previous half hour listening to my doctor talk about LDL, HDL and triglycerides, yadda yadda yadda.  Even though I'm not in a risk group, I should start watching what I eat, or at least pay attention.  As he spoke in my mind I was completely blaming the Black Hoof Caf√©, all those damn dim-sum places and Dufflets for my predicament!  They were to blame!  

It was almost like (notice I said like) getting informed of picking up an STD by your doctor and in your mind blaming it on that one night of weakness where you went home with that girl from Devil's Martini just because she showed you a lot of cleavage, or maybe it was that friend who provided you \"added\" benefits, but alas who am I to kid?  It was all my own fault!  There's no one to blame but myself.  Booohooohoo..

So I was planning on drowning my sorrows at Gabby's with some beer, wings and rings over lunch,as if my last half hour was just a bad dream... but instead I ordered a diet coke, chicken fingers and a salad!! A freaking salad!  It's so true, you CAN'T make friends with salad!!

The only thing that mildly cheered me up was listening in on all the conversations between these college kids around me, trying to be cool.  I've forgotten what it was like to be young, innocent and thinking I knew everything. 

There was a table of chef wannabes across from me who were talking about the merits of Thomas Keller as if they've eaten at his place a few times over.  Really?  THE Thomas Keller?  As in the owner of the French Laundry which is on one of my 100 things I must do before I die list, and on the S. Pelligrino's World's 50 best restaurants Thomas Keller?  Seriously, would these kids know what a Micheline star was if there wasn't so much food porn on TV?  

Then I listened in on this girl talk about her poker skills and how guys don't want to play her anymore because they complain she wasn't showing enough emotion while playing (which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever).  Now every time she gets a card she supposedly feigns a laugh and that too is annoying her friends..  Boy, if I felt she had more than pocket change in her purse, I'd invite her to a few of my fun games.  It's a different game when you have friends who are professionals.  Here's a suggestion, pick up Doyle Brunson's \"Super system\" then get back to me.  I guess if you don't know you're sounding silly, you just... sound.

Then there were all the conversations about the Olympics. They all had an opinion on everything, such as who should play in goal tonight vs the Russians..  \"Martin Brodeure is like as old as my dad!  He should retire.\" Not only is Brodeure a hall of fame goalie, I'm one year younger than Marty. *sigh*  Anyways, plenty of TVs around as I watched the replay of Joanie Rochette's heartbreaking skate on one of the projector screens and the ski cross on the other oversized plasma.

So where's the review?  I had a freaking house salad and chicken fingers!  The lettuce was green, and the plum sauce probably came out of a jug.  Leave me alone.

The service was mediocre as I had to wait 9 mins for the server to take my order during lunch service.  So there."}
{"text":"It's mediocre, they have decent drink special  but their  selection  isn't that great.  8 didn't eat and 8m glad I didn't. My friends  got food and well none of it look good or tasted  good by their words."}
{"text":"I got the fish & chips, the fish was tasteless and the fries appeared oven heated bought from the grocery store. The sauce that came with it is probably the worst tartar sauce I've tasted. 
Shame since it's close to school but it's worth it going for the drink specials. Avoid the fries though, not worth the price."}
{"text":"Empty on a Sunday night, good service, the wings were great, but I was disappointed that there were only nine wings compared to the usual 12 from other places. Fries were generic could have been from anywhere, and the overall price was respectable for two people."}
{"text":"These guys below with the bad ratings are dicks. Gabby's still rocks the house, even after I graduated from George Brown across the street. P.S. We'll miss you, Amy! xoxo"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Gabby's, I get the boneless wings with fries for $9.99. If you go on a regular day, you will have a delicious filling meal. If you go on a half-price wing day, you'll finish your meal and THEN be like, \"okay, NOW I'm hungry.\"  

I just don't get how you people can call it half price wings when your portion size decreases on those days.  It's the biggest injustice since the continuation of 8 Simple Rules following John Ritter's on set deathl!!!  Perhaps this is some kind of business/sales tactic to get me to buy more food.  You're trying to swindle me Gabby, and I don't like it one bit.  We all know you guys are just trying to fool us, and for what? To save a few crufty fries? Get the fudge outta here Gabby! 

Even though the boneless wings are delicious and the suicide sauce is amazing, I can't give you more than three stars cuz the servant brought me apple juice that was 99% ice.  1% apple juice means 1% tip lady.

Meh. 3 stars."}
{"text":"When I first arrived and checked out the Yelp reviews, I was puzzled as to why they only had 2.5 stars. It became clear why...

They were quick in bringing is our menus, but service time exponentially decreased after. I thought the food was okay for a pub style place but my friends thought it was gross and that they were representative of 2.5 star food. I got the vegetarian burger and my friend got the same, except hers was oozing with mayo. So much in fact, that there was enough for me to dip my fries in.

Anytime we needed something, there were no staff available to serve us. My friend had to directly go to the bar to ask for service. They seemed to be seriously short staffed with only one lady behind the bar and I have no idea where the other guy was. We were in a hurry to leave but after waiting 5 mins, it was apparent that no one was coming back to our table. I had to go to the bar and tell the server that we wanted the bill. It was average pricing for average food, but there are many places nearby that serve better food and have better service for around the same prices. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We didn't have any issues with our server, she was very quick and good, same with the food. We got a pound of bbq wings which comes with celery/carrot sticks and ranch - nothing special but not bad, side of sweet potato fries were good and came with a lot of fries and a beer, with tip 30 bucks."}
{"text":"I had Fish n' Chips.  Soggy, chewy fish with fries from a bag served with three packs of tartar.  For $12, they couldn't even put the tartar in a bowl.  There is no excuse for frozen food.  Especially if you are a block from St. Lawrence.  The beer was beer and the taps are mostly domestic.  This place belongs in a strip-mall in Bolton."}
{"text":"Mom always said there'd be compromises.  My fellow comic buddy Dave and I try to get together to write new material because, God knows, we need to.  We always hit this issue.  I live in King West Village, Dave the Beach.  So, there's always an argument as to who's going to be travelling to  the other's territory.  Thankfully, there's the rule of mutual inconvenience, wherein we look for a spot that is inconvenient for the two of us.  A quick look at a map shows that this Gabby's location is pretty much half-way for both of us.

The other determining factor for this location is that this Gabby's like all others in the franchise run a half-price wing special on Wednesdays.  Writing Wednesdays it is, then.  Smaller than many in the franchise, this Gabby's finds itself right across the street from George Brown College (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/george-brown-college---st-james-campus---a-toronto) and sees much action from the students across the way.  As well, the area is stepping up in terms of condo and home development, so more and more people are looking for a decent local.

The staff are attentive and seem to know when we're at work versus in need of nourishment or a pint.  When refreshment is necessary, the staff swoop in quickly and courteously.  The wings, by the way, are quite decent.  I'd like to speak to the rest of the menu, but I've only ever had the buffalo burger there.  That too is good stuff.  Not just a decent pub, but also an alright place to try and come up with a new batch of dick jokes."}
{"text":"Looking for bad food; bad service and bad attitude, then be sure to check out this place. 
Beer is OK and reasonably prices however steer clear of everything else.
Got there and was very hungry and ordered the Chicken Cobb salad. It was a mishmash of whatever they had in the kitchen....pizza cheese, corn, iceberg lettuce as well as some sort of nondescript dressing and carrots as well missing Blue Cheese and avocado which I think are a signature of a Cobb. Being hungry I ate it but after realized this was not a cobb and asked the waitress what kind of salad was this as it was not in  any resemblance a cobb. She...Being less then happy to listen to this I (She pointed out the fact that I ate it all) I pressed the fact that the menu indeed stated Blue Cheese and avocado in black and white and she was not at all impressed and said something like \"ya mister\" 
Anyways, not at all impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for the pizza over lunch... they have thin crust pizza here for ~$14.

Meat lover one was nothing special. But, I really liked the goat cheese one and I think hawaiian. Yummm..."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience ever. We came here for mothers day dinner my mom, her husband, my daughter and my self. It had a few customers when we walked in at the bar. We ordered are drinks which took 10mins to come back because she was talking to her friends (customers). Once getting our drinks she took our ordered once getting our food she spilled ranch dressing all over my dress and feet. Apologied but that was it. Worst experience  ever. Do not recommend this resturant at all. Only doing a star because I have to."}
{"text":"Ok. So here's the thing about this Gabby's - I've been to many before, many times, but this location is unique - in a bad way. 

The main thing is the quality of the food for the price - I always come when I get the familiar craving for sweet potato fries, but no longer! I have finally accepted the fact that the food at this location just isn't that good - which is strange, because I love the Gabby's on Bloor Street. 

Also, the service isn't that great. I've never been a server before, but I bet it's not ideal to work at a student bar, where you constantly have to deal with underage people and not enough tips, but, I've actually been told by a waitress there that if I want to know the specials, I should check the menu. Really!? And you think \"maybe she was just having a bad day\", but it hasn't been much better other times I've been. 

Definitely don't go to this location if you are looking for a fast, cheap lunch! There are way to many other great restaurants / pubs in the area for you to settle on Gabby's. (And if you do go, don't get sweet potato fries! Or nachos. Or sliders. Or quesadillas....)"}
{"text":"Worst pub over ever been to. Horrible service. Waitress messed up our order of drinks, then guilted us into paying for her mistake saying, \" if you don't take it I'll have to pay for it.\" The waitress was trying to make a scene so we just took the drinks. I'll never step foot into a Gabby's again."}
