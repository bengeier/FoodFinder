{"text":"Love, love, love this place - and it loves us right back!

Anything you can order here is fantabulous and there is always way too much of it after their simple but spectaular salad, bread and herbed butter.

Friendly and always, always, always stellar service!"}
{"text":"I wanted to meet up with some old friends and our wives and was looking for an Italian restaurant that my friends hadn't been to.  I immediately thought of Bruno's.  I'd been to Bruno's once before and was anxious to get back.   We had a group of 8 so I made the reservation a week in advance for a Saturday night.   They did a nice job getting the table ready early.   We enjoyed an appetizer sampler tray that included bruschetta, sausage stuffed peppers and fried calamari.   It was absolutely delicious and plenty to share.   Our dinners included lasagna,  chicken parmigiano,  vitello saltimbocca, and pizza.  Everyone enjoyed their dinners.  The pace was perfect!  We finished with coffees and limoncello cake!  A wonderful evening with good friends and delicious food.  We even had Chef Bruno come out to say hello!"}
{"text":"Bruno's is good, not anywhere near as great as everyone I know has made it out to be. The portions are huge, and the quality and presentation is fine; however after my third visit I'm still not blown away and I'm not planning on heading there again anytime soon.

The dishes are just honestly unremarkable; if you have ever ordered a quality chicken parmesaen dinner before then don't expect it to taste much different then what you will get here. Tomato sauce even tasted watery last visit. 

The last time I went there I had printed out an online offer for 1/2 off select dishes during the month of November. My girlfriend brought the print out offer and they told us that they could only use it for one of our meals as she didnt bring two copies. Nowhere on the form does it mention bring one per oorder and it's not like we had seperate checks. The waitress mentioned that she can \"call the owner\" which we weren't even asking her to do. A male host (I think thats what he is) said \"he's out of town\" which was a bold faced lie; you could just tell (besides, if you were really going to call him would it matter seeing that most of the population has cell phones???) The staff all had a pow-wow at the bar talking about the coupon, too (in direct view of us.) Classy. 

We had called for reservations around 4:00 p.m. for 7:30 p.m. The same guy who said the owner was out of town told us \"can you make it 7:00 p.m.?\" We obliged. When we got there at 7:00 p.m., I expected it to be slammed. Not a single person was there. It was oibvious this guy (who frankly looks like the epitome of lazy) just wanted to go home.

Bruno's also does catering; allegedly. I had requested a quote awhile back for a small event; 20 people. Nothing too intensive. I recieved no less then three emails and two phone calls continuosly asking more questions. I had been specific in what I had requested. Still never got a quote. Gave my business to someone else. 

Finally, I hear a lot about the sketchy neighborhood. To me, that hasn't been a problem. I kind of like the fact that it's off the beaten path and it adds to the charm of a restaurant like this. I just wish the service and frankly the food, had as much character. 

I'm sure this place does fine off of it's reputation but the next time I want italian I'm heading to Stino di Napoli in Rocky River, which is the most amazing Italian food in the city. 

Long story longer, don't offer discounts or monthly speicals without making it clear as to what needs to be done to redeem them. Bad move. I won't recommend this place to anyone until the service gets better. It will be awhile before I bother again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food in Cleveland. My husband and I had been here multiple times and it is our favorite. We wanted to take our friends out for their 10 year anniversary so we made reservations for a group of 12. Because our evening had multiple stops, I thought it would be easier if we did family style so that we wouldn't be pressed for time with everyone ordering. I set up the menu with Fred weeks in advance, who was super helpful in choosing what dishes may be best and are most popular. I was very happy with the price that we decided on for the full meal we had planned, including apps, salad, wine, main dishes and sides, and dessert and coffee. 

When our party arrived, the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. I forgot that a friend eats only gluten free and they brought out a separate bowl (and I mean a huge bowl) of pasta for her. They even surprised the couple we were celebrating with tiramisu. 

The amount of food we were served was immense. We all ate our fill and then the staff boxed up the leftovers, even making a separate box for our limo driver. We had so much leftover food that the next day we had a party and all brought our leftovers. And we STILL had leftovers for lunch later in the week. 

You cannot beat the hospitality, quality, and value of Bruno's Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Long overdue review. Bruno's is our favorite Italian restaurant in Northeast Ohio and has been for years. We love the homey casual atmosphere, the service is always great and the food fantastic. My wife and I enjoy dining at Bruno's as a couple; we love to bring family and friends to Bruno's and I have entertained business guests at Bruno's. All have enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"My last review was in 2011. I vowed to never go back. Here we are, almost 2015 and I just had a moment of weakness. Or perhaps a moment of hope? Either way, it became yet another Bruno's regret.

I placed a to-go order for lasagna with extra sauce (if you read my review from 2011, the lasagna was BONE DRY, so I thought this was a good way to mitigate my problem). Suspecting that my order might again NOT include bread (c'mon folks, it's Italian food, I have to ORDER BREAD?...) I ordered garlic bread. I was shocked to come in to pick up my food and find a $25.00 bill:

Lasagna: 16.00 (whhhaaaaaat????!!!!)
Extra sauce: 2.00 (okaaaay.....)
Garlic Bread: 7.00 (ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? THERE WERE ONLY 2 PIECES!!!)

I'm sorry guys, but you just aren't that good. I'm glad you are trying to capitalize on your proximity to Ohio City, but you have to offer a little more than location to justify these prices. To charge $7 for two pieces of garlic bread was my final straw. We recently relocated from Rocky River, and I was looking forward to having Bruno's as my neighborhood Italian spot. Somehow, you have made Johnny's ($$$) a better value."}
{"text":"I loved coming here for the food, service, and that it is in my neighborhood but I'm not sure what has happened to this place.  We were ignored at the bar for 15 minutes or more while our table was set for a party of 5, then it took me flagging down the waiter to get us a drink after being seated another 15 minutes.  It was almost anti-service especially for a place that seats 30. I've been a bartender for 20 years and have never seen anything like this.  I literally watched a woman water every table except ours Hope you're friends with whomever waits on you because if not, you are in for a loooong wait and evening.  Save the time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Charming restaurant with delicious food. Huge portions. Can't wait to go back. Make a reservation because there's only like 30 seats in the whole place."}
{"text":"I work with an older Italian lady, and one day during casual conversation she told me how she ALWAYS goes to Brunos.  so when some west side friends of mine wanted to meet us for dinner, I said lets meet in the middle, and we hit Brunos....
Welllll
To say I was unimpressed by the outside is an understatement.
But once in side..... Nice, clean, and tidy quaint little place...
NOTE this is NOT a chain establishment and the FOOD was to Die for...
AND OH MY GOD PLENTY OF IT.

I had NEVER had Tomato sauce that tasted so fresh.  I heard from the waitress that they make ALL of their sauces in hoes from scratch.  I could tell from the tomato sauce, it actually tasted like tomatoes, and I don't even like red sauces.
Words do not describe how happy I was with Brunos

and I WILL be returning!!!!!!
Once I finish off what I had left to take home!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Service took forever. Food was not good at all. I have been to many Italian places to eat. Food was bland. Dry. No flavor. Also cold. Dinner for 4. Took 2 hours. Really."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had calamari, stuffed shells, and fettuccine Alfredo. For drinks, gin and tonic and Manhattan. Dessert, cannoli. Literally every single thing was amazing. If you like Italian food check this gem out."}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything of the rest of the menu, but the pizza is among the best I've ever had. I went for lunch on a weekday and we were the only people there for most of our meal. It does get really busy for dinner though."}
{"text":"Hubby and I both had bad meals at Bruno's for the first time, on a recent Wed. night. 
All we could figure was there was a bad chef pinch hitting in the kitchen!

My long-favored gnocchi with blush sauce had a horrible red sauce on it. The al dente linguini my husband ordered was mush.

Ugh. Bad."}
{"text":"Wow...what pizza joint uses no cheese and frozen vegetable medley? This fucking place!!! Ordered 2 take away pizzas that were basically great crust plus frozen veggies on top. Dis-a-fucking-pointing! Cheese and marinara would get 4 stars, currently getting 1. Fail..."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Bruno's several times over the years and now leaving a review.  I have never had a bad meal, bad service or issues getting a seat - make a reservation even if you are sitting at the bar, my favorite place to sit.  Pricing is very reasonable and portions are huge.  Nice wine selection - Chianti Classico Corte Mora.  Bartendress Rose on Friday's at the bar is the best."}
{"text":"Brunos has become my new favorite italian food in Cleveland! The manicotti is my favorite, but the tiramisu is AMAZING. It is a huge portion of delicious, light, heaven. Meals come with soup or salad and homemade bread. The servers are always nice, the one somehow always remembers the salad dressing I order! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My review is based on take out I've actually never been inside/ate inside...this place is great food is delicious & wonderful spaghetti is really good even better with the meatballs very tasty but the chicken Marsala is phenomenal! I get it every time! The side salad with house vinaigrette is amazing so delicious! Also love the garlic butter for the bread (you only get 2 slices with take out)"}
{"text":"The wine list was not up to date; The first three selections I made were no longer carried. How hard would it be to print out the current available wines?? The vintages of many other wines are not shown, causing me to have to ask our server who also didn't know. Annoying.  The large tables that seat 8-10 are too close together. This causes guests to pass used plates as well as other diners entrees back and forth rather than each guest being served. Annoying and not cool. I had the house salad, pepperoni pizza, and canolli. The small boring salad came swimming in balsamic vinaigrette.  The pizza was wholly unremarkable with paper thin, cheap pepperoni. it was a very disappointing pizza. The canolli are the not sweet variety, they were boring and very bland. 
Save your hard earned $ and eat elsewhere, They may be trying but they just aren't there yet."}
{"text":"A great find for someone who visits Cleveland infrequently...We went when we found our first choice in Little Italy closed for lunch...Now we have a new first choice for a great Italian lunch.   The positive reviews here are spot on!  And it was definitely worth the drive to the west side.  Great service from an extremely busy but very personable waitress...big portions, good wine selection and the chianti by the glass was reasonable enough...chicken cacciatore was excellent as was my wife's veal marsala...tiramisu fantastic..great coffee...the real deal mom and pop Italian...Don't drive by and get turned off by the neighborhood...Trust the positive reviews here for this place...."}
{"text":"Four of us went to dinner - we had the veal caprese and chicken parm.  Took a plain pizza home.
Very good Italian food - huge portions.
I was the only one that finished all of it.  The others took enough home for two days.
Our server was very nice.  A couple of things got miscommunicated to the kitchen so they gave us a good sized piece of the tiramisu.  Enough for the four of us to share.
It is located in an interesting neighborhood that is showing signs of some very nice revitalization going on.
You are supposed to park across the street at the car wash.  The restaurant has \"Security\" keeping an eye on the car while you eat.  Remember to tip this fellow.  If I wouldn't have read that on line, I would not have been aware that I should have tipped him.
It is a small place - I would recommend calling to make reservations."}
{"text":"This is a small, out of the way place that's situated in a neighborhood that makes you double check to be sure your car doors are locked... But the food is amazing! It's a tiny place - maybe room for 24 people. The bar is beautiful... And small. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. The food was amazing! Great lasagne, wedding day soup was fantastic, and the portions are enormous!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good!!! Just make sure you have a reservation. It's a very small place and even the bar gets jam packed with people having dinner!! Arrive hungry as you will want to eat everything!!!"}
{"text":"The best Italian joint from here to New York City. Nothing to complain about.Anybody that complains about this place is just not happy and has to find a problem.Anything you order on the menu is not good, but perfect.Why waste your time to go to the so \"called little Italy of Cleveland\" and waste gas,time,and get a average meal. This is the joint, not the joint in New Orleans.Be a sport people and don't be cheap like most are in this town, give the guy $5.00 that sits outside watching your car.
The food isn't good, it is excellent.

For all you clowns out there that have negative things to say about this great place to eat, stay away and go elsewhere to be miserable!! YOU MAKE ALL US HAPPY PEOPLE WAIT FOR A TABLE!!!

Food is top shelf!! Come to eat otherwise you have a meal for next day. Don't forget about the steak."}
{"text":"This was by far the best meal and bang for my buck i've had in quite some time. I went here with a fellow yelper for the clambake, which gave you a course meal for $22. 

They started us off the standard bread and butter, then a clam chowder that really made me want to take my finger around the bowl, but since I was out in public I opted to just sit and wish I had more! Next we clams, which made my night, they were cooked to perfection and the buttery sauce they were in just makes me smile thinking about it. Then out came the main course and at this point I knew I wouldn't make it through the meal, but my goodness it looked and tasted absolutely amazing!!! We had a quarter of blackened chicken, sweet potatoes that had a delightful cinnamon seasoning,clam pasta, and a roasted ear of sweet corn. 

Dessert left alot to be desired since it was the smallest piece of cheesecake ever. It tasted amazing though. Let's just say I had a great meal the next day:)

The only really awful for me was that the waitress mixed up our meals when she took them away to box them up and some my food was in my dinner dates food and then it was all mushed together. She definitely corrected it and gave me more pasta in a separate container,so I was very happy! If this is offered again next year,I will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food! The Clam linguini, lasagna, and blush sauce was amazing! That's all I had so far, can not wait to go back, really great prices as well. I know I am going to have them cater my next event."}
{"text":"Had a pretty average Italian meal here with my wife and another couple.  We started the meal with warm, crusty bread which was tasty and served with an herbed butter.  Off to a good start!

Our meal came with a small side salad that was fairly basic topped with their red wine vinegar based dressing.  For a table appetizer, we shared and order of fried calamari.  The dish was filled larger pieces and a good mix of crispy and chewy with a decent marinara sauce for dipping.

For my main entree, I had the chicken parmigiana...it was overdone and chewy, and the sauce was too sweet for my (personal) taste.

For dessert, we all shared a Tiramisu.  The presentation was lovely and the spongy cake was delicate, creamy, slightly cinnamon and drizzled with chocolate sauce...delicious!

Really, this came down to personal preference as I prefer much more tangy / bitey red sauces and theirs is of a more sweet variety.  Server was pleasant and the interior cozy."}
{"text":"Wow. I was in town visiting family. The food was amazing! We each had different dishes and no one was disappointed. Service was excellent. Next time I am in town from Texas, I will have to make it a point to stop in again. Bring your appetite. The portions are very generous!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Bruno's and I must say I was very disappointed with the service. The reason I was disappointed was because we got there at 7:30 for our reservation sat down and ordered our drinks and food. The drinks and apps came out right away and everything was delicious and on point. However things went south as we then waited about 45 minutes before we asked where our food was only for our waitress to tell us that because of the large party of 12+ that it was taking longer than normal. Then we waited another 30 minutes before we asked another server when our food would be ready, since our waitress was avoiding us after we confronted her about the wait of our meals. They said that they were finally plating our food and that it would be out, however by this point it was 9:30/9:45 and none of us were even hungry enough to eat our meals. We all ended up getting our meals boxed up to take home. Lastly when we told our waitress about it she informed us it was because they were not as prepared as they should of been for restaurant week and that she was sorry (which is oddly strange because you have to make reservations and with parties that big you should be more prepared ahead of time). We even had to ask if we could be compensated for something and all she could offer was dessert.....finally when we were walking out they sent the cooks to apologize which was so upsetting and unprofessional that the manager them self couldn't come over and apologize. I think it will be a while before I go back and if I do I'll make sure I only get take out because even though the service wasn't the best the food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing Bruno's... I first found this place in 2002. I was rebuilding the W.44th street bridge and we started checking out every place in the neighborhood. So, all dirty with jackhammer dust me and the rest of my construction crew(quite a motley crew I may add) stumbled into Bruno's on our 1/2 hour lunch. 
    We were a little taken aback to see people in suits, including a Cleveland councilman, in this tiny place on a weekday for lunch. We immediately felt out of place, underdressed, and too dirty to eat here.... Well, until the staff, the councilman, and Bruno all thanked us for the job we were doing in the neighborhood. They were very gracious, sat us quickly, got us our check early since they knew we had limited time.
    I have taken my wife, as well as some of our friends here. NOT once has Bruno's ever disappointed me, my wife, or our friends. This place is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in the city of Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"I *finally* got to experience Bruno's.  As you know, I have been on a quest to find good Italian in Cleveland so I had to round out my search with a shuffle over to Bruno's.  For starters, the bar is really nice.  Old school bartenders.  The interior was way more updated than I expected compared to the sign out front.  I was expecting the old, shoddy red and white checkered tablecloths but instead was greeted with a nicely color coordinated restaurant.  Okay, the food.  I didn't like Bruno's red sauce.  I thought the sauce needed salt and seasoning.  It didn't have much garlic, either.  My penne was just penne.  And the meatballs clearly had been frozen based on their texture.  My boyfriend ordered a large (and I mean large-and-in-charge) calzone.  He said it was good.  This place is more about quantity than quality in my opinion.  I think Aldo's is a better authentic Italian experience, and I still claim that Nido Italia and Dolce Vita in Little Italy have way, way better meat sauce and marinara sauce.  Hell, Gallucci's, \"Mama Gallucci's sauce\" is better than Bruno's.  I really wanted to like this place but I've experienced better Italian food."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Italian place I've been to! The food takes time to come out, and for good reason. Savor every bite, you don't get this kind of food often, and come hungry--the portions are huge! I ordered the eggplant lasagna and my friend got the regular lasagna, both of which were phenomenal. We ended with a tiramisu which was much bigger than I expected, and just as delicious as everything else. In addition to this great food, the staff is extremely friendly and make some damn good drinks as well. Our server Samantha was very courteous, took good care of us, and made us our drinks. If there's any advice, it would be to make a reservation. You need one for both the bar and tables, for the reasons I mentioned above. 

Highly recommended, do yourself a favor and go here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bruno's for years. His food is amazing and very generous portions. I typically get 2 to 3 meals.  have ordered several items off his menu such as gnocchi, lasagna, veal with wine sauce, and my favorite eggplant rolls stuffed with ricotta cheese. It is definitely worth the trip to that side of town. And the price is great."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. I got their lunch portion of Chicken Parmesan with Wedding soup. I ended up splitting a cannoli and teramasu for dessert. It was all amazing. The chicken was served over fresh home made pasta and it was perfectly prepared. The desserts were also awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Caesar salad, Veal Milanese like i have never experienced before.  Truly simple dishes in nature, but executed impeccably.Thank you Chef. The Cassata cake (usually very rich and heavy)was the lightest i have ever experienced, thank you Mama.
     We had a party of eight, and the service was also , impeccable. Brittany?kudos, from someone who was in the industry for 15 years. All in all , the best Italian cuisine I have experienced in a loooong times"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Cleveland!  The gnocchi with blush sauce was amazing!!  Also, the prices are very reasonable. Everything is made to order so doing expect a quick in and out:"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I came here for my birthday. He ordered the chicken parm and I ordered the gnocci. Both were delicious! The amount of food you recieve is ridiculous. We both had plenty leftovers. The wedding soup was the best I'd ever had. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Small and quaint and you will miss it if you drive too fast but the staff is super friendly and the portions are huge! Some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten. From the soup to the desserts everything was great. They have a Sunday brunch as well thet I will entertain in the future"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite. Best Italian in Cleveland or Akron! I have had the seafood pasta, fettuccini alfredo with chicken, and the chicken parmesan. All were amazing. The Fettucini alfredo was my favorite but never the healthiest option, so good for indulging. I have tried the lasagna and some other specials that were ordered and they were also amazing. Everything is great here and has that historic Italian restaurant vibe. Large portions but they are great at boxing everything up to go. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The bread to start with is Excellant, comes with side of garlic butter. We had eggplant parm, eggplant lasagna, and pizza. All excellant. Small place so make a reservation. Service excellant. Holds about 40 people plus the bar seating. Definitely worth the ride to near west side no matter where you are. 
I keep coming back. It's great."}
{"text":"Some of the review on here made me laugh.  This is not a place for the hipsters. Sorry guys.  This is not a trendy side of town. Not Tremont or Ohio City.  Believe it or not, there is life outside of the suburbs too.  Is this the best area?  Heck no, that's why there is a security guard outside (whom you should tip on the way out).  However, at no point have I ever felt unsafe while being here.  

This is the most authentic Italian meal you will ever eat.  Not just food wise but the entire experience.   This is a small restaurant.  Maybe 10-15 tables depending on how they set them up.  Make reservations.  

Service is NOT slow.  We've had great servers every time we've been here. This isn't meant to be a meal you eat and leave within an hour.  That's not the way Italians eat dinner.  It's meant to be a time to sit and enjoy the company you're with.  They will being your appetizer.  When you're finished with that they'll bring the soup and salad.  They make the meals from scratch, so yes, they take awhile.  What's the rush?  Have some wine, enjoy the delicious bread with the amazing garlic butter and do as the Italians do!!  

There really are not enough words to describe how spectacular the food is.  This is the one place I will order something different each time I go and everything seems to get better and better.  You will also have enough food leftover for two more meals.  They don't skimp on portion sizes.  We've had everything from veal, scallops, chicken and just plain old pasta and every single item has been delicious.  

So, if you need somewhere to take good friends and family and you're looking for some good food, go to Bruno's.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the good. Ordered veal caprese and lasagna for dinner. Veal was good. Lasagna was outstanding. The sauce was acidic....which i prefer over sweet. Some of the best lasagna I've ever had.

Ordered the Antipasti and Calamari for apps. Antipasti was delicious. Peppers done just right. Prosciutto was perfectly sliced. Kalamata olives were a great touch.

Calamari was atrocious. Bland, like chewing on rubber bands. Dont waste your money. Dessert was pretty disappointing also. Ordered Cannolis and tiramasu. Cannolis were the WORST I've ever had. No sweetness at all. Horrible. The tiramasu was just average. 

Honestly i will go back, but only for the lasagna. Everything else was sub par."}
{"text":"3.75 stars- Quite the experience with a large group of Yelp International Supper Clubbers.  

The servers tried to be very accommodating and attentive when we had more guests than the stated reservation.  She created separate checks for each of us, even though there were 15-20 of us total. 

Their red wine selection was decent and 2005 red that I had was alright, not the best, just alright.  A fellow Yelper's glass had a large amount of sentiment from the wine, which didn't look too appetizing- it happens. 

I ordered a house salad and Bruno's Seafood Special Pasta(?) something along those lines.  The house salad was nothing special, just typical plain romaine, tomatoes and a few pieces of cooked bowtie pasta.  The bread that came to are table was boring, but the garlic butter that went on top was delicious.

The seafood pasta was delicious.  It had a nice and light frothy tomato base with plenty of mussels surrounding the dish.  The pasta had mostly mussels, calamari, scallops with a disporportionally smaller amount of shrimp and clams (like 2-4 pieces).  Don't get me wrong; I will take calamari, scallops and mussels, but I also like shrimp and clams.  

My friend ordered a calamari appetizer with spicy peppers, which was not good at all.  We expected an order of fried calamari with a spicy tomato sauce on top.  It was nothing like that.  The calamari was over cooked and swimming in a spicy, bland, soup broth.  All you would be able to taste was the spicyness, nothing else.  No other flavors.  

I would go back for the seafood pasta and maybe that garlic butter.  I have yet to try their desserts, though."}
{"text":"Very good appetizers, I like the bruschetta and the fried calamari.  For dinner, the lasagna cannot be beat, also the margarita pizza is very good; love the chicken cacciatore and all of the eggplant dishes!!!  It's loveliest when we sit outside to enjoy our meals, can't wait to keep coming back.  Chef Bruno brings classic old world taste  to Metro Cleveland."}
{"text":"We were a large party and enjoyed our meals. It is rather chilly in the restaurant so take a sweater. Pretty atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had been trying to make it to this establishment for quite some time now, and finally got to experience Bruno's last Thursday.  We were seated right away, drink order, appetizer, main entrees ordered in the first 10 minutes.  Noticed instead of normal Frank Sinatra/Dean Martin type Italian classics, we were listening to what seemed to be light dubstep.  Our first hint at our food was 40 minutes later when the waitress said our appetizers were 'almost ready'.  Calamari was standard, maybe above average, bruschetta was 'meh'.  fast forward another half hour before we were told our entrees were almost ready. She got the ravioli.  Again, very standard if not slightly above average.  I got the potato encrusted pan seared walleye.  It was pretty terrible.  Potatoes were grey and soggy instead of golden brown and crispy.  Fish was overcooked, terribly bony, and tasted slightly spoiled.  I decided this all within the first two bites (I took a second bite even though I spit out the first one).  First time I have ever sent an entrée back.  Service was lacking.  I think the attentiveness had been reserved for the 6 top next to us."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing meal and a wonderful experience at Bruno's.  To begin with the chef graciously agreed to adapt the broiled long bone veal chop they were offering to a veal Milanese and it was fantastic. Could not have been better.  
As good as that was the experience of having a young man get on his knee and propose to his future wife during dinner was a very sweet part of the evening.  Having a complete stranger buy their dinner made me realize how great the people of Cleveland are, and once again made me proud to be part of this community.  
Thank you Bruno's for being here."}
{"text":"We went last night (valentines day), they had a special 5 course dinner, that included wine pairings for $39 a person!! The 1st course was grilled scampi in a delicious sauce, followed by heart shaped \"raviolis\" filled with mozzarella and drizzled with another fabulous sauce, next came the filet...cooked to perfection in a semi glaze...best steak I've had in a long time. Charred just enough for added flavor, along with delicious mashed potatoes. Then the salad, good, but nothing special. Finally, the dessert, a strawberry truffle so light and delicious that we ordered another dessert! Our server, Russell, was amazing as well. Attentive, knowledgeable, easy going, and fun. He also made our second helpings of dessert! A chocolate, ricotta filled cake, and a pistachio cake...so.freaking.good. We've been to Bruno's multiple times. I've never had a bad experience. Small place, so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing sauce and really classic decor. I enjoy myself every time I'm here. Lunch, dinner, bar or table. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I honestly would give this restaurant more stars if I could.

Cleveland's my hometown.  And whenever I visit family, I ALWAYS want to dine here.  This wonderful restaurant is on the near west side of Cleveland off of I90.  Scary looking neighborhood.  Many shuttered homes.  But there is a guarded lot across the street.  

It's a small establishment.  I haven't had anything here that wasn't phenomenal.  Gnocchi; eggplant, veal and chicken parmesans; fish; spaghetti and meatballs - - all wonderful, with great portions and low prices.  And you must try the tiramisu.  

I wish this was in Chicago - - but maybe I wouldn't appreciate this fantastic restaurant if it were.  Note that there is a small bar that seats maybe 10 and approximately 7 tables.  So if you are there and check it out, make sure to make a reservation.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sensory identity theft.  Neighborhood run down then you step into a nice looking restaurant so you say food should be good.  Bread and butter was tasty and a nice  house wine.  Banana sausage, lemon chicken, Marsala, piccata and seafood below par and not enjoyable. Over rated and not worth the trouble or money."}
{"text":"SOOOOO very good! I had their chicken fettuccini Alfredo, the sauce was nice and thick, not too cheesy, but just enough. Also a lot of times Alfredo can come out oily but this one wasn't! We also tried their penne vodka and their simple house salad, we got big portions for just the two of us. So very yummy"}
{"text":"Perhaps due to the holiday, service was not it's typical, impeccable style.  It was Saturday night and a packed house.  We waited a bit  for our reservation. If you haven't been to Bruno's before, it can get tight when waiting for a table around the bar area.  Do not let this deter you from having a great dinning experience.

After being seated, we waited for an extremely long time for just water.  0nce the drink order placed, things went more smoothly.  The warm, rustic, crusty bread w/ the herbed butter was placed on table and we were much happier.   

The food came out in a timely manner.  The meals were picture perfect.  Linguini in clam sauce is made perfectly.  The fresh garlic is added at the optium time which made the white sauce perfection.  My tablemates had the veal medallions in marsala and artichokes(I like sauces made w/ booze, so it was nice), the chicken parmesean and the veal parmesean. (both were spot on).

The thing I mostly like about Bruno's is the pasta.  The homemade pasta is truly ideal.  The noodle is wider than spaghetti but narrower than linguini.  The pasta is served al dente, which with fresh pasta is an entirely different experience.  Heaven.

The meal was rounded out with tiramisu.   Bruno's tiramisu is a bonefide recipe.  It is the icing to your catatonic, glazed-over-eyes, full-belly experience.  If too full, I strongly recommend a slice to go!  



PS   Park across the street at the custom car wash lot.  There is an attendant that literally, watches, your vehicles.  Be sure to tip the man a few bucks!  Be sure to be extra generous with that tip when it's cold outside!   :)"}
{"text":"Bruno's is a place I would have easily driven past without a second glance... It's not huge nor is it near the beaten path.  It is, however, worth going a little bit out of the way for!

Walking in, you feel like home; the restaurant is very small and cozy with decor that is not over-the -top.  You can smell the garlic and the fresh bread smells wafting toward you as you are seated.  I would recommend making a reservation if you're going during a popular dinner-out night as there is not much seating, but it was not crowded on a Monday evening.  

I ordered the gnocchi and was pleased to find out that all entrees come with soup or salad so I chose the Italian wedding soup.  It was very flavorful and LOADED with meatballs!  Ordering a whole bowl with all those meatballs would have been a meal in of itself (one that would warm the soul I might add!).  My gnocchi with blush sauce came out like pillows straight from heaven.  They were very fluffy and the sauce was not too heavy... I'm not one to like tomato sauce, but this blush was perfect!  The portions were HUGE and we all ended up getting boxes for lunch the next day (my gnocchi were even better today if that's possible).  

We all decided to order dessert as well since calories don't count when you're with friends.  I got the cannoli which were really tasty; they weren't the best I ever had but they were nice a crunchy which is a big plus for me.  One of my friends ordered the lemoncello cake which is definitely what I would choose next time.  It was tart without being sour and was very refreshing.

The staff is very attentive and checked on us numerous times 

Overall, a very pleasant meal!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Bruno's.  They have returned the Sicilian Chicken to their seasonal menu.  Great idea if you ask me!  Boneless chicken breast, topped with eggplant, then baked in their fabulous blush sauce and topped with melted cheese.  Make a trip there to try some before it is off the menu again.
My guest had the chicken parmigiana which was fantastic as always.  Cesar and wedding soup for starters, a perfect Martini, great wine and attentive service made this a great dinner at a VERY reasonable price.  LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service.
Looking for good home style Italian cooking then this is the place."}
{"text":"love this place...best Italian food in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner yesterday afternoon who suggested this restaurant.  We had never heard of it. Walked in about 4:30 and the smell of sauce and garlic made our mouth water.  Pasta entrees come with soup or salad. We had the salad, nothing fancy, but very fresh.  The best part was the lasagna.  HUGE portion and the best I've ever had hands down.  Service was excellent as well.

We will definitely be back and have already recommended this place to quite a few people.  This is a hidden gem, so make a reservation because it fills up quickly (only about 12 tables).

Can't wait to go back again :)"}
{"text":"Huge freaking portions. Pasta tasted fresh. My only complaint is that there weren't many healthy options on the menu. It's so easy to get to from the freeway and I'm glad we stopped there on our road trip."}
{"text":"After reading that this is the best lasagna in Cleveland I had been wanting to check it out for a long time. Finally got the chance. Here are my thoughts:
*Lasagna was very good. Lots of layers, very good sauce. Would have liked a little more meat in the sauce, but overall great flavor. Would not go as far as best in Cleveland though.
*Portion was huge, definitely could share, although good for leftovers too.
*I prefer cheese more golden brown. When I asked, the bartender he said it could not be done as they don't have a broiler, only an oven\". Huh???
* House salad dressing was great.
* Waitress was very nice, bartender not so much, maybe it was a bad day, but, still...just did not have a good attitude. 
*The swinging doors to the kitchen  (think saloon doors from an old western ) were super annoying in such a small place. Am sure that could be easily fixed. 
*Someone had suggested they are better for take out than dine in. I agree.
* I'd prefer to go with 3.5 stars, but, of course not an option."}
{"text":"Came in around 6:30 on a Friday night without reservations, the staff was very sorry they couldn't give us a table -- they've been REALLY  busy since the listing in The Plain Dealer came out. They set us up at the bar and it was - I think - even better! Great service, great energy and the closer to the drinks, the better, right?

We started with a special Fresh Artichokes, fried with provolone and sauce - delivered with 4 HUGE delicious hearts that were crispy on the outside and creamy perfection inside. Poof - gone! 

I love a good gnocchi, and Bruno's with their amazing blush sauce were divine. Hot, fluffy pasta bites smoothly covered in perfect sauce with tiny bits of sweet onion and chunks of tomato. my husband enjoyed his beef Marsala and our friend raved about the special shrimp pasta. 

We checked in on Facebook and were rewarded with a humongous slice of tiramisu - made by Bruno's mother. It was enough for all of us and the perfect end.

Bruno's has the perfect warm and welcoming atmosphere, coupled with delicious food that you can taste was made because someone loves to do it. I cannot think of a better combination for a relaxing dinner with friends. But remember, it's very tiny and they're getting a lot more attention lately from the '50 Things to Eat & Drink\" listing, so reservations really are a good idea."}
{"text":"Very good service. The food is American Italian; thick, heavy sauce, large portions, rich. I enjoyed the meal and the small intimate dining room. This isn't light gourmet italian....and that's OK. Love it for what it is."}
{"text":"So glad we tried Bruno's.  About drove by because it isn't much from the outside but I looked at another review that said the same thing so we gave it a chance.  Cozy ambience inside. It is small and gets busy so I would suggest a reservation. All of the food was amazing, from the wedding soup and Caesar salad to start, with authentic dressing, to the lasagna which indeed was the best we have had. We also tried the Pollo Romano which had a wonderful pesto cream sauce.  Everything was wonderful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a chef friend once tell me \"There's no great italian food in Cleveland's Little Italy\".

He may have been right, but I do know where there is some great Italian food, right here at Bruno's! My family's been coming here for over a decade and it just can't be beat. From the atmosphere to the service (the barkeeper is great) to the food. You can never finish what they give you and that's perfect. 

Great ambiance, great music, great bar, great food, great service. Love it. 

And always tip the guy watching the cars!"}
{"text":"This place is small, so figure dinner is gonna take about two hours because the food doesn't come out super quick. You should make a reservation.  We had: Veal parm- good. Scallops- good. Spaghetti with Meatballs- not good. Overall an average experience."}
{"text":"Cute little charming place in the Clark Fulton neighborhood. We decided to go out because 1. it was national lasagna day and 2. Brunos was highly recommended. Tastefully decorated and a balmy atmosphere. They have a special  cocktail menu but beware, the drinks are about 11 bucks. The drinks are very good. The house cab is very dry and perfect with pasta. Menu is extensive. We came for the lasagna. It is big. Huge, in fact. My wife's was fresh and delicious but mine was old and burnt. I didnt finish it. I leaned over and ate some of hers. It probably should never have left the kitchen. Caesar dressing had way too much anchovy in it. Service was subpar. 45 minute ticket time with only 14 people in the restaurant is unacceptable and the waitress never apologized or offered us a drink nor an explanation. The food runner girl that looks like Paul from the Wonder Years kept auctioning off food. There was a table near us with 4 birthdays. To my surprise she brought out 4 birthday cakes but instead of placing them in front of the birthday boys, she auctioned them off. Fail. A busser girl stacked dishes very high and I watched her pour half full glasses together in one tall glass until it looked like a tall cup of coffee. Yuck. I will probably give Brunos a second chance but not sure when. 17 bucks for lasagna."}
{"text":"We live on the Eastside and the drive can be considered \"long\" - 25 minutes - we loving going to Bruno's.
We (a crazy group of 6) had dinner here last night for Christmas Eve Dinner. Though they didn't have any fish specials, Italian Christmas Tradition, they had their amazing menu. My husband, the Italian, wasn't upset with the change. The menu does offer seafood, just prepared as tradition.
Our service was good for being a busy night, and light staffing. The bar menu was truly festive (a little heavy pouring keeps everyone in a good mood) and the food was excellent as always."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!
What a wonderful little find! Small... like 10 tables small. Delicious and hearty Italian fare. Between us we had lasagna, gnocchi, sausage n peppers, and linguine with white clam sauce. We all took home boxes and dessert boxes as well. Our \"block\" of limoncello cake could feed three and is to die for!!
Definitely on the comeback list... but make reservations to be sure.
I must add that the staff was wonderful and accommodating!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first ever experience at Bruno's.  Unfortunately, this meal was pretty terrible and a total waste of $40.  

I got a take-out meal of chicken parm and chicken lemonese.  Both dishes came with a cup of Italian Wedding soup and two very small slices of bread, one of which was the butt of the bread and was mostly crust.  

My order was supposed to be ready at 8pm and I waited around for 15 minutes and finally was able to get my food, which was not very fun in such a tiny restaurant where people are always coming and going (they have no waiting area, but a huge table in the front that takes up a lot of space, so there's no place to really move for patrons who walk in after you).  

The wait time was small in comparison to the food issues.  The red sauce on the pasta was super gross, I don't know what was in it, but it looked and tasted very bad, way too salty and stuffed with weird ingredients, not just a simple red sauce.  The chicken parm was super, super dry and the breading just fell off right when we cut into it.  The limonese was a little tastier but it was cold!  

I live only 8-10 minutes from Bruno's so I am pretty sure it was just sitting in the kitchen as I was waiting until 8:15 for my food that was supposed to be ready at 8.  The restaurant shouldn't offer take out if it can't deal with the volume of diners and take out patrons.  The soup was the only thing I received that was actually hot--the chicken parm was warm and the limonese was almost cold.  The side of pasta that had red sauce on it was overdone, which was probably the worst.  I at least expected good, al dente pasta--nope.  It was super soft and just yucky.

Overall, the meals were gross and WAY overpriced.  I was super disappointed after seeing so many good things online about this establishment.

Lastly, I was not impressed by the customer service at all.  When I walked in, at least 3 employees walked past me without even saying \"hello\", and I was clearly standing in front of the server's podium waiting for service (it's obvious when people come in/out because it's such a tiny restaurant). 

I felt cheated out of a lot of money and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Hells-to-the-yes with all these awesome Yelp Check-in Deals lately! 

I mean, a free, huge slice of homemade tiramisu just for checking in? Don't mind if I do! 

Let me preface this update by letting you know that I was pretty down-right miserably sick when we stopped in here and I *still* had an incredible meal. 

First off, the staff is awesome. Our waitress had the best sense of humor, and trust me, you have to have one of those when you're serving my Dad--the king of bad, offensive jokes. (Don't tell him I said that...) She was sassy, but sweet and super efficient. 

Second, the food is consistently delicious, simply prepared and the portions will feed you for a week. It tastes like something your little, Italian grandma would cook you with love in the kitchen. Last time I had the chicken parm, but this time I went with the gnocchi with blush sauce. I don't know why I was surprised, but I couldn't help it when I saw well over 3lbs of fluffy, light, pillowy gnocchis coming straight at my face. Holy-mother-of-pearl that's a lot of food! And divine to the t'buds, too! My Dad shared the veggie pizza and the lemon chicken with my Mom. They both loved their meals. Jason went for the traditional lasagna again and finished his whole plate! 

I mean, you just cannot go wrong here. I think we even saw a pro athlete dinning here! This is really the place to come with a group to enjoy great company, ambiance and food!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this restaurant for the first time.  It's easy to miss and it's a neighborhood that you wouldn't normally go to for this type of dining experience. But don't let that deter you.

It's straight up yummy cheesy Italian food. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and works well for small groups or a dinner for two.  I ordered the manicotti. It was cheesy with fresh tomato sauce and well seasoned.  Everyone at my table was happy with their meal whether they ordered veal or eggplant parmesan. 

The only negative is that they don't do separate checks for large groups. So if you're going with more than 5 people, bring cash!  We also had fresh bread with a flavored butter."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  It's one of Cleveland's best kept secrets, and a place we always take visitors.  The food is top notch, and the service is always friendly, fun, and helpful.  The place is tiny, so reservations are recommended, especially on weekends.  And, be sure to have the limoncello cake that Bruno's mom makes!"}
{"text":"Lovely! Very happy we decided to try a place of the path, thanks to Yelp! True, the neighborhood could be better. The food was great, tortellini dish and chicken Parmesan were great with freshly made pasta.  Very nice inside, small and intimate, I would make a reservation. Try the tiramisu, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Alright Bruno, you did better than last year's clambake so I am upgrading you to three stars. 

I did not have my squad with me this year so I had to get take-out. You did go 20 minutes past the time you said the food would be ready, but staff was friendly, updated me regularly, and even offered to buy me a drink (I declined, was fine with my water). 

You increased prices again to $26. The meal now includes a small Cornish hen which was hard to eat, the sweet potatoes are now mashed, and the sauce for the clam pasta was more watery than creamy. Also, this year the dessert included a large slice of chocolate cake (which was okay, I liked the pumpkin chocolate chip cannoli's from 2015 better). All that being said, it was not bad at all. I still wish you would go back to 2014 when you had that delicious half blackened chicken, grilled sweet corn, and seasoned roasted sweet potato wedges, but I will continue on with my clambake tradition at Bruno's and just keep my fingers crossed for next year. I'm totally fine with a price increase, but only if the quality of the food improves along with it. 

I enjoyed the fresh bread with herb butter, the clam chowder was tasty, and only one of my clams was chewy so a big improvement from last year. I was worried about getting this to-go, but you did an excellent job of packing it all up and including everything down to the liquid butter for the clams. Still a lot of food for the price when comparing to other clambakes around town.

As always, your pasta dishes looked huge and amazing! One of these days I am going to have to try some lasagna or something."}
{"text":"Bruno's is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. If you haven't tried Bruno's eggplant lasagna, you haven't lived, its so delicious. I also love the sausage stuffed peppers, and calamari appetizers. Bruno's is the perfect date night restaurant, especially sitting on the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN IN CLEVELAND! 

I've only gotten it as takeout but it is phenomenal. The restaurant seems pretty small so I just get it to go. If it's this good to go I can't imagine how good it is there. The food is priced beyond reasonable and the portions are huge. 

The chicken Parmesan is the best I've ever had. The eggplant lasagna is delicious too. Their red sauce is so flavorful and so is the Alfredo. Ahh!! I'm hungry just thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite food in Cleveland. I always try to arrange a visit to Bruno's when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Very good American Italian food. Great service. This is place is food porn.

This is a small cozy place with an old school vibe.  The next time I have to whack some one  I will do  it here. It is a pretty small place so I recommend reservations as it was filling up around 4:00 pm on a Sunday. I have been here 2x. My god every thing looks amazing. Huge bowls of pasta and main plates flying out of the kitchen
 Lets start with the bread.  It is served warm with a home made seasoned whipped butter.  I think it may be an Orlando bread that is baked in house. Very light and flaky. The butter has a light garlic taste and some herbs.

Next the fried calamari.  It was  lightly breaded and fried perfectly. Every piece just melted in my mouth., no chewyness. The marinara sauce was quite nice with plenty of visible herbs and tomato chunks. Some of the best calamari I have tasted. Next time I will try the sauteed calamari next time. I can tell it was made in house and not some mass produced over breaded Sysco product.

The entree came with a choice of soup and salad. I chose the salad as soup would have been too much of a good thing. It was a standard small dinner salad.  I flavored it with balsamic and olive oil . No big deal. 

The chicken and veal Parmesans where excellent. Fried perfectly. The breading is just a tad too thick hence the 4.5 stars, none the less it was fabulous.  Same sauce as the calamari. So much food.

The side of spaghetti that came with it was pretty dam good as well.  It tasted like it was home made. Almost a little creamy. I think they may have finished the spaghetti in a pan with olive oil and some of the sauce as I could definitely taste the olive oil.  I added a healthy shaking of red pepper and it was Amore!

I was able to take 1/2 , my food home, Service was great, and the food came out quickly and  very reasonably priced for the quality and portion size.  

I will be back, arrivederci!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in Cleveland to date. I've been to little Italy and Luca in the flats and Bruno's food far surpasses the rest. We started with a small calzone which was not small and could have been an entire meal in itself. It was excellent. Next we had the veal parm. Not only was it amazing it was so large we in hindsight should have split it."}
{"text":"I love finding small, independent businesses that are passionate about what they do. Their service was excellent despite having a busy night with many demanding guests. Great wine list - and much respect to a smaller establishment that stores and serves their wines with care. The food was great, dessert was good, and fine coffee to end the night. We'll be back. Thanks for a great evening, accommodating us during prime dining hours despite us not having a reservation."}
{"text":"Late in posting this review but this is one of the best Italian restaurants on the westside of Cleveland. It's not in a great area but overall safe; if you can get past the neighborhood, it's a must try. Their wine list and after dinner drinks were spot on. Their gnocchi and ravioli, wonderful. Dirty martinis were on point."}
{"text":"Hidden gem that provides an authentic Italian experience!  The menu is good from top to bottom with large portions and exceptional red sauce.  The space has a chill bar when you walk in and cozy dining area to the right.  While it may be off the beaten path for some, it is right off the highway with plenty of street parking and definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Crazy good Italian food just a stone's throw from Ohio City. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. I didn't dine in but got carry out. The service was prompt and courteous. Love my lasagna and will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's birthday here last night, and overall, would highly recommend!

Although the pace is quite small, we made a reservation and they set up a spot to easily accommodate our group of 9. Appetizers and meals were delicious -- with plenty of leftovers to go home with, as the portions are generous! We had the gnocchi, spaghetti, seafood pasta, eggplant Parmesan, ravioli and more between us and all were quite happy with their meals.

Service was very kind and attentive, if a bit slow with the food for our size group. But we were in no hurry -- and they brought out a generous slice of Italian lemon cake for the birthday girl!

An unexpected gem in the neighborhood, we'll be sure to be back."}
{"text":"When I first made reservations for Christmas Eve, Bruno's was not on the top of my list.  I had been there before and never had a bad experience, however it is far away from me and just didn't stand out.  After calling 3 other Italian establishments, all were closed and Bruno's came to the front by lack of choice.  
This is the rare situation where lack of choices proves positive.  Reservations were easy to make and the Holiday arrived and I took my party to this quaint little establishment.  We took the drive in through inner city Cleveland and just felt appreciate of the holiday, life , and good food to come.
We were taken to our table quickly.  It was about 5 pm and I was fairly surprised it was pretty empty.  Good for us once again.  Romantic ambiance and just a good feeling.  Menus were handed out and meals were picked.  Drinks were served and soon too was appetizer, soup, salad, & meal, + dessert.  
By all means the food was GREAT Italian food.  Every good restaurant puts its own little spin on Italian, but this stays pretty true to the classic...thin sliced meat (or veggies if that is your thing) light on the sauce but heavy on taste.....and let's say sauce isn't so light....the portions are huge, the taste is great.
I was very happy.  We also were talked into desserts which are all homemade.  This is truly a family owned and operated restaurant.  Very pleased.  Been here before, will be coming again.  Next time I want Italian I will now remember to think of Bruno's first."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times the food was outstanding! I'm truly impressed at how much I enjoyed the delicious offerings at this little restaurant. It is a gem!"}
{"text":"ohhhh emmmmm geeeee! i seriously LOVE this place. like NOT just love it, but LOVE it. holy italian stallion. the food is authentic. home made pasta. home made salad dressings. home made everything. warm bread with AHHHMAZING garrrrlic butter! be still my beating heart. 
heads up: it is teeny tiny in there. 
make a reservation.
i have eaten at the bar which i am not opposed to, but if you have a group, you will certainly want a table and a reservation. 
i have yet to try their tiramisu, but have heard from many around  town that it is to DIE for. D-I-E!!! i have seen it. the last time we were there, i actually saved room for it, only to be told that they were sold out. um,  huh? sold out???? per our lovely server, \"mama only makes so much and when it's gone, it's gone'......so we tried a lemon something something and honestly, even that deserves high regards, and i am not even a lemony kind of gal. 
i would eat here once a week, if my hips would allow. unfortunately that would require much more time at the gym then i can handle!!!"}
{"text":"WARNING...I am not really a fan of Italian food...and this place reminded me why. The people and place are really nice (inside only). Everything is cooked to order so it takes forever to get your entree. The food presentation was beautiful.  l had eggplant parmesan rolled and stuffed with ricotta; and I really could not differentiate it from White Castle cheese sticks. The calamari appetizer and side salad were both standard...and tasty. It all came to exactly $28 plus the tip and I can still make a complete second meal from the leftovers. Not bad overall but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Great Food and service! Some of the best spaghetti and mushroom sauce I've ever had! Fantastic meatballs too."}
{"text":"The Mama Disalvo's of Cleveland, but different, slightly. Love it. Cute place to dine with a nice bar. Small dining room for that intimacy, but you can carry out as well. Very good wine list that supports a regional Italian theme. Perhaps the best Italian wine list in the city? I've never been disappointed by anything from Bruno's. Rock solid. Try lasagnas, veal preps, and meatballs. Sauce is divine."}
{"text":"I really want this to be my favorite Italian restaurant but.....it's not. Living within walking distance of this fine little Italian spot is convenient but not desired. We've tried this place 6ish times and not once did I think it was that great. I would not recommend the lemon chicken unless you like your pallet overpowered by sour lemon. I could not finish this meal, it was not edible. Now, in fairness the waitress warned it was very strong, but never did I expect a professional meal to taste so bitter and LEMONY! hahaha I like my lemon chicken 10x better. The meatballs are decent. Lasagna good, but not the best. 
If you order take out, expect smaller portions, but you'll pay the same price. Service is always nice."}
{"text":"What a change from last night's Italian dinner! We were in Cleveland today and my daughter has had a craving for linguine in clam sauce.  We got to Bruno's and didn't see it on the lunch menu, but they prepared it for her anyway!

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The Italian Wedding Soup appetizer was outstanding. Then the fresh hot bread with garlic butter on the side.  SO GOOD!

My daughter's clam dish seemed to be good... she went through chemotherapy a year and a half ago and her appetite STILL isn't what it used to be. Lately she only seems to be able to eat a few bites of her meal and saves the rest for later... BUT she ate about half of her heaping plate of pasta and clams! So that should tell you something.

My wife ordered Chicken Marsala and I snuck a bite of it. It was excellent.  She finished it off!

I ordered my favorite... Veal Parmigiana. I asked ahead of time if the veal is fresh and real or a processed patty. Nope.. it was real veal! My ONLY complaint was that the veal was on top of my spaghetti. I don't know why it seems to be the trend nowadays to stack food on top of each other on plates, rather than next to each other on a plate, but it was outstanding. The sauce was perfect, too and the pasta is house made.

We are a good 90 minutes from Bruno's but it WILL be our go to Italian place when we are there!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place to have dinner with friends, co-workers or quality time with a loved one.  Awesome atmosphere and most importantly Excellent Italian food served by a wonderful staff. Generous portions, Prices are reasonable. I just love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"The bread was the only thing worth eating.  Ordered the lemon chicken it was so strong with lemon felt I was just eating a lemon.  The chicken tasted a bit spongy but the place was too dark to see if it was properly cooked. Received a nice portion three pieces. I picked at one piece and just said I will take the rest home to be polite when I got home and looked at it closer it was raw inside. Dinner came with a salad that was very average and side of pasta.  Service good. Will not return. First and last time."}
{"text":"Do not pass this one up! The location seems a bit questionable but Do Not let that inhibit your decision! I have passed it by repeatedly and said we need to try it. I had the grilled swordfish special with a delightful sun dried tomato, onion and pancetta sauce with a side of asparagus and pasta. Large wonderful portion, perfect char on fish and Flavor!  Fish was slightly uneven in cooking - a little dry on one side but mostly med rare as it should be. As a previous Yelper pointed out the wedding soup was good but quite salty. Sounds like this may be how they prepare it which is unfortunate. My boyfriend had the shrimp special. Again large portion, nice size and quantity of shrimp with pasta and large halved olives in a red pasta sauce. Very fragrant! Iced tea was fresh brewed and not watery! Intimate, clean and cozy! Friendly staff! We will return!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Found a really good Italian beer I'd never had before. Menabrea. Huge portions, but a lot of it is pasta. A little too much pasta. I had the seafood. Big giant scallops, etc. It was very good."}
{"text":"I love this place. They're known as having the best lasagne for a reason. My favorite is the eggplant version.
The service is always awesome (our server Samantha was great) and food delicious. And the portions are ridiculous- you're going to have leftovers for days. My significant other ordered pasta w seafood and it easily could have served a table of 4. I think it was around 25 bucks and came w salad and bread (love the garlic butter). I love this place, 5 star love, but to be totally upfront if you haven't been, the location is not the best, but there is parking right around the place and I didn't feel like there was any true threat. The decor is totally outdated, but this isn't a sticking point for me, I like the cozy family feel and the place is clean so while it may lack in updates, it doesn't lack in atmosphere. These are the only drawbacks, but the food and friendly service make it a must visit."}
{"text":"Cozy ambiance, great service. We tried the linguine a la pescatore which was okay. Will definitely go back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Incredible staff, cozy intimate atmosphere, and incredible food at a reasonable price. Best Italian spot outside of little Italy hands down."}
{"text":"Wow. What an incredible find. Next to the family car wash in a west side neighborhood. 

7 of us and they didn't blink when we asked for separate checks. Everyone got something different and every single meal was beyond excellent. 

A very welcoming and comfortable place. The staff was superb. 

The price? Most excellent; that's why it got 5 stars."}
{"text":"Bruno's was just wonderful. The Veal Milanese Caprese was a great combination of perfectly cooked breaded veal, with fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and a balsamic glaze that really completed the dish. The Veal Parmesan was excellent and enough to take home a full meal from  leftovers. Save enough room, if possible, to share a piece of Limoncello cake, which was light and fresh with a killer frosting. Just an excellent meal with very good service and reasonably priced. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We have had wonderful experiences here but sadly the reservation process has made Brunos no longer an option for us. We were not able to be seated anywhere near our reservation time and in fact, while highly disappointed, we decided to leave after waiting over 25 minutes past our reservation with no idea of when a table will open. No manager on site and just verbal apologies. Bummer. Brunos won't be on our list in the future."}
{"text":"We went here for my daughter's 17th birthday.  All the food was great and the service was outstanding.  The portions were huge with plenty left to take home.   Everything was reasonably priced.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Cleveland restaurants and one of my favorite go to's for a great Italian dinner 

This visit had my family of four out for a nice Friday dinner. We enjoyed the complimentary bread and herbed butter. Don't follow our lead and order too much or you will be hard pressed to finish your dinner.
We ordered an appetizer of stuffed hot peppers. It was spicy hot... too hot for my taste but my family enjoyed them. 

The dinners came out promptly and we all enjoyed them very much.
I ordered the Melanzane Ala Parmigiana(rolled eggplant stuffed with ricotta), accompanied by a side of spaghetti marinara. They also offer an eggplant lasagna which is delicious as well. 

My son ordered chicken parmesan and his portion was huge.
My husband had gnocchi which he enjoyed. 
You really can't go wrong here. 
Please call ahead for a reservation as Bruno's is tiny and fills up fast. Especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Surprisingly disappointing. This was my second time coming here after an unbelievable first experience. The service was good, our table was ready on time, the atmosphere was nice, but my meal was tasteless and bland. Almost to the point of the chef may have forgotten to add something.  I ordered Chicken Limonese, the same dish I ordered my first time and the reason I went back. Unfortunately there won't be a third time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while and now I kick myself for it. Weekends can get really crowded here, but I went on a weekday, and it was perfect. Service is super attentive, and excellent. The food is even better than I remember. If you like larger portions, this is definitely the place. You will not find a better deal in Cleveland than the \"Bruno's Famous Linguine Alla Pescatore\" if you like seafood and pasta. For $25 it's about 3 meals in one."}
{"text":"I really loved Bruno's! We came for a family celebration, and I took the advice of other yelpers and made reservations, because it is a SMALL place. It is not fancy- pretty unassuming. But it's nice and simple, and honestly, reminded me of a lot of the humble ristorantes in Italy- it's all about the food here, not the decor.
The service was great- they kept water glasses and the bread basket filled.
The FOOD!
They had a nice, thorough wine list. They have a full bar (but no liquor on Sunday). We had 2 nice bottles of wine.
The bread was soft with a light crunchy crust, and a garlicky herb butter. Really good.
I had the Lingine alla Pescatore- seafood pasta. It was humongous. I laughed when the brought the bowl. But it was soooo good. It's like a treasure hunt to find all the scallops, clams, and shrimp in there! The sauce is a really light, perfectly seasoned tomato sauce. It's great because the seafood stays the star here. All the seafood was cooked perfectly. The calamari were not too tough. The scallops were just right. It was great. And it's still great, because 2 days later, I've still got leftovers.
My mom had Shrimp Arrabbiata and found it too spicy, but I think she has a low tolerance (so beware!). Everyone else really enjoyed their meal.
We ended with tiramisu. Big giant pieces of tiramisu. It was perfect. Not too soggy. Right proportions. Beautiful. A great way to celebrate.

If you haven't been to Bruno's- I recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came here last night to celebrate two family birthdays and my mouth is still watering.

Upon walking in I was really underwhelmed, the dining area is about as small as a living room with no decoration on the walls. The chairs and tables were basic and looked rickety. This restaurant is also not in a very good area, they even have a guy that stays outside to watch your cars. Needless to say I was skeptical. This is a great example of why not to judge a book by its cover.

There were six of us and our pleasant quirky waitress explained the menu to us while we decided on bottles of wine. We started with the non breaded calamari appetizer, this was honestly the most underwhelming part of the meal and I wouldn't order this again. It is such torture watching servers walk by with HUGE portions of delicious homemade Italian in the biggest over sized plates and bowls I have ever seen.

I ordered the veal Parmesan. I have never tried veal before but the man watching the cars said 'if you order anything with veal, you are in for a treat' so I figured he knew best. I was so glad I did because it was divine! Every thing came in super sized portions, I snuck bites off of almost everyone's plates so I can say that the  chicken Marsala is out of this world along with melt in your mouth meatballs. Don't forget about the pillowy gnocchi. I want to go back right now. Everybody will leave with a box,  now whether the delicious leftovers even make it til the next day is up to you, but it will certainly taunt you in your fridge. Also most meals come in at under $20!

Seriously do not let the atmosphere of this place scare you away, A great dining experience among great company with some of the best Italian food I have ever had. Sounds like a perfect night to me."}
{"text":"Bruno's is amazing.

I visited for the first time recently after hearing rave reviews for months. I ordered the gnocchi and it was some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. The bread...the bread was so good....everything....MY MOUTH IS WATERING! I must go back asap!!!!

The service was also excellent. Our server was so friendly and helpful - I loved him! I wanted to write him a poem! 

Some people are put-off by the neighborhood. While it is true that this area isn't exactly the loveliest, you should be fine. Never let a neighborhood's reputation stop you from experiencing ecstasy (anywhere!)!"}
{"text":"Some friends that had been to Bruno's before took me here. On the ride up here, they really talked this place up. Maybe i had too high of expectations, but I was a little disappointed. 

We almost couldn't get a reservation but Bruno personally got on the phone and got us in. They had to seat us outside, which ended up being pretty nice. They have a very nice patio.

The service was pretty good. The waitress was very helpful and made a good suggestion for dessert.

The food was also just OK. The portions were, in general, huge. The marinara was amazing. Some of the dishes such as the Lemon Chicken had a surprisingly small portion that looked out of place next to the overflowing bowls of pasta and a 3 pound chicken Parmesan. That was fine because the Lemon Chicken was nothing to die for. I got the Sea Bass. The fish was very fresh and well cooked, but the preparation was lacking in boldness. It was sitting in a lukewarm watery substance that was not flavorful enough to be a sauce and more than anything just made the potato breading get soggy. The Linguine Alfredo was pretty bad. The sauce was so thin it couldn't possibly stick to the noodles. It tasted like someone took heavy cream and mixed it with Parmesan out of a shaker. There was a weird gritty taste to it because the Parm was not well incorporated into the sauce.

Dessert was very good. Our table shared a Strawberry Shortcake. We were expecting fresh strawberries. There were no whole strawberries on it, but the dish was delicious enough that we didn't seem to mind.

I wish I had the experience that my friends raved about."}
{"text":"Bruno's is absolutely the best Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The menu has variety, the prices are great and the portions are huge. You can't go wrong with the veal parmesan. Trust me, half of your meal will come home with you. Also, be sure to save room for dessert. Bruno's mama makes them. The tiramisu is to die for!  I always take half of that home too!  The restaurant is tiny so you'll want to call before you come but they're very accommodating with reservations. This is a restaurant you don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy.  Growing up in an Italian family, I have unreasonably high standards and expectations for Italian cuisine, so I usually just avoid Italian restaurants altogether because it rarely measures up and I usually leave full but disappointed.  But the food at Bruno's was a delightful surprise.

It's as authentic as it gets. Everything, down to the pasta is homemade. The flavors are robust and the portions will satisfy even the biggest Sicilian appetite.  I had the lasagna and my girlfriend had manicotti.  The ricotta filling was creamy and savory. The sauce is just perfect: not too thin, not too thick; not too sweet, not too bland.  Beautifully seasoned.  We also had a very nice Chianti recommended by our server.

We had to have a little patience with the service but the place was very busy so that was fine. All in all, they took good care of us. You can't do better for Italian food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Keep it short and simple. Great food, good prices, great service, awesome patio in the back. Hard pressed to beat Bruno's."}
{"text":"I HATE HATE HATE giving places one star. Especially restaurants. There is just no way to avoid this - everything from beginning to end was miserable. The best part was leaving ... an hour and a half later. 

Fine things of the evening:
1. Location - I'm all for trying different places in \"meh\" areas. This was one of those for sure. There was a lot of construction so finding and parking was probably a little more difficult than normal. But whatever. We parked on the street. 
2. We were promptly greeted by the bartender (the only prompt thing that happened that evening) - who escorted us to a four top in the corner. So far so good. 

Now --- onto the not so fine. 
1. We sat & sat & sat to the point where I wondered if we had to go to the bar to order drinks. 
2. There were 3 people on the floor. A server, bartender, and busser/food runner 
3. I'm not sure what the bartender's role really was as he literally made two martinis the entire time we were there, did not help anyone, and had no one at his bar. He could have very easily picked up the slack of the server but was sitting back there polishing glasses or was absent 
4. While we sat and waited to order the food runner ran the wrong food to the wrong tables. It happens - no big deal. But the server did not use proper candor in handling this. The one gentleman was 3/4 done and ready for a box by time his correct side of pasta came out. She did not approach him and tell him what happened. He just kept looking around for her and she did not approach him. 
5. We ordered an app and food at the same time. Got our app (stuffed hot peppers) rather quickly. Didn't look like the normal stuffed hot peppers. There was no red sauce with them - But, they were pretty good. 
6. It took an additional 35 mins for us to get our food. Mind you, the entire time the only person on the floor is the food runner. The one server was absent from the floor for 10-15 mins at a time.There were very obviously 3 tables looking for her at a time. It took FOREVER for these tables to get their checks presented and then to pay 
 7. The food itself. We both got veal dishes. I got Veal parm and he got the Veal Caprese. Both were so breaded it was hard to actually enjoy the tenderness and flavor of the veal itself. and on top of that the breading had no flavor and tasted burnt. The sauce surrounding the veal parm was definitely burnt. I tried the side of pasta hoping for some sort of meal revival --- the sauce was so tangy I only had a bite. Most of my food was still on the plate when they came over to box it  (I didn't take it), My boyfriend said his veal was also pretty flavorless and overly breaded. 
8. The food runner who was probably 16-18 was in charge of running food and cleaning/resetting tables. It was very obvious where the food was supposed to go was not communicated between her and the server as she walked around the floor with plates auctioning them off to incorrect tables. She approached tables asking \"Do you want boxes\" and them walking away touching her hair in between bringing out more food. 

I wanted dessert but after waiting forever for the food I decided to just give up and leave completely unhappy. We got there at 7 and finally left around 8:30. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It missed the mark on service,food, atmosphere (which i didn't really expect going in)."}
{"text":"Best wedding soup I've ever had.  Great food!  Only negative is the tables for 4 are a bit small.  I kept hitting my knee against the person that was sitting next to me, so that was uncomfortable.  Besides that their food is fantastic, highly recommend for anyone that loves Italian food."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm a big fan of their chicken parmesan. Very cheesy!

Also, my girlfriend has Celiac's, and they have gluten-free pasta!"}
{"text":"Well first off the food was outstanding. Mel our waitress was great. This is a very small place with about 10 or 11 tables inside with a great looking bar. The neighborhood isn't the nicest but this is one business that is trying to turn that around, they also own the car wash next door. All of the dishes we ordered where outstanding, they were the following: 
Banana Peperoni-very good (warning alittle spicy)
Wedding Soup- very good but a tad salty for us
Chicken Parmigiano-was outstanding and huge
Bruno's Famous Linguine alla Pescatore- outstanding
Mama's Famous Tiramisu-The Tiramisu was the best that we have ever had!!! 

We are definitely going to Bruno's very soon again."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the home made pasta.  It was my first time there, and I was in the mood for Chicken Parm.  While it was good, I loved the pasta best.  I took half of my food home and it seemed to lack flavor.  Whether or not it was just that my house lacked the ambiance of the restaurant or it really wasn't anything to write home about, I'm not sure.  I will surely be back and anxious to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Our meal was disappointing. The veal was so chewy that I spit it out in my napkin. This was the first time in my life that I sent a meal back. They replaced it with an okay chicken dish. Waitress offered to bring my family dessert while I ate the chicken. I thought they would have taken either the chicken or dessert off the bill. They did not. Although we enjoyed the pasta, we will not return. It was a miserable experience."}
{"text":"I had the veal parm and it was on the bland side.  Everyone seemed pretty underwhelmed with their food.  

From the moment our party of 6 arrived it was clear that our server wanted to flip the table as fast as possible as we were rushed right from the start.  I understand it's a busy night but rushing customers accomplishes nothing.  All in all it made for a less than spectacular dining experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland, OH (following the Cubbies!) and Bruno's was recommended to us by a bar tender we had that was from Chicago like us. We told her we were looking for a better restaurant but not out of budget. Bruno's definitely met the challenge. We checked yelp after we were given the name and decided to give it a try. As suggested we made a reservation and were greeted and seated promptly. I had chicken Parmesan. It was delicious and a huge portion. I was very sad to leave the left overs. But with traveling had no where to store them. We also enjoyed Tiramisu. It was delicious. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Bruno's.  Last time I had the Gnocchi with blush sauce and a salad.  The salad was small and not the freshest.  The gnocchi was pretty good.  The blush sauce was delicious.  We were overcharged for our meal and we didn't realize it until we got home.  I was not sure I'd return.  Tonight, I gave it another shot.  Another salad that was brown and old.  This time I tried the cheese ravioli.  I got home and took a look.  It was inedible.  The sauce tasted like something out of a can.  The ravioli were most definitely frozen.  I am not one for overly flavorful things but this meal tasted like nothing.  It tasted like the water it was boiled in.  I was able to rinse off the ravioli and I had some jarred Little Italy sauce so the meal was salvaged.  2 chances is all you get with me.  Will not be returning.  Choose one of the other wonderful Cleveland Italian eateries around town."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Wife and I had sautéed calamari to start, which was fabulous. Then we had chicken parmigiana and eggplant lasagna. Small place. Make reservations. And park across the street."}
{"text":"Enjoyable, friendly, and accommodating! It's a small place so make sure you have a reservation. It's a little bit more expensive than other places, but it's worth it. Large portion sizes. I took someone there for their birthday and told Bruno's beforehand. They had a piece of cake and candle all ready to go for desert!"}
{"text":"We came in at 5pm and this place only has 12 to 14 tables, but 4 tables taken and still made us wait for 8mins (strike 1). The host was weirdly rude (strike 2). We were really excited to eat food as many ppl recommended it & ordered Pollo Alla Parmigiana aka (Chicken parmigiana), homemade gnocchi with Bruno's blush sauce and finally tiramisu. 
The server got the bread with garlic butter which is awesome, but just 3 small strips  had to ask like 3 times to get more. (Strike 2.1)  finally 35 or 40 mins later we get food and then I had hair in my gnocchi  (strike 100) . 

Other then that food was amazing highly recommend it!! 
FYI look for hair in your food"}
{"text":"A pleasant and homey find on Cleveland's West Side. Friendly service and delicious food based on recipes from the owner's Italian immigrant mom. Two of the four entrees at our table were lukewarm but we still plan to return. Huge portions!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent Bruno's and are always impressed by the food. Of all the places in Cleveland that do Italian, including Little Italy, this is one of the best.

But let me be clear- you don't go here for ambiance (really nothing special and a bit outdated) or stellar service (can be slow), you go for the great food. And yes, they are difficult to get to if you aren't familiar with the maddening one-way streets in the area, but you will be glad you tried.

The prices match the above and it's a good deal for what you get."}
{"text":"Sometimes when you hear all sorts of good things; you expect a little less, a little more average, something to keep you grounded in the inevitable disappointment.  Well, let's say I wasn't disappointed at all.

Arriving, the staff was friendly and the space small and intimate.  We had a coupon from the website (hint!!) for a free appetizer so ordered the calamari.  It was delicious!  Served with a side of fresh, delicious, and homemade marinara sauce, I couldn't stop eating those little buggers!  

Since the lasagna is highlighted as being \"The best in town\", obviously two people from my table ordered that.  My mom claimed it to be not only the best in town, but possibly the best lasagna she's ever had at a restaurant.  Not that we're Italian or anything, but we do like to eat out a lot!!  

I ordered the gnocci in a blush sauce.  It was delicious with fluffy little gnocci bites.  Oh, and should I mention there was a WHOLE POUND of it!  Every time the waiter came by the table he joked about if I'd even started yet.  

All the sides were delicious, the entrees come with salad or soup (Wedding soup) and even the bread was great!  Everything was reasonably priced and I was pleased with the wine menu.  The only negative that I have is that I forgot my leftovers in my fridge instead of bringing them into work.  I want to eat them right now!"}
{"text":"Cute little family type place in a slightly sketchy area, but very intimate and welcoming. Service is just okay, there aren't many tables in the restaurant, yet it seemed to take a while to even order and receive food. Also felt rushed out before I could even finish my meal, it felt like the server  couldn't wait to take my food away to put in a box. They apologized for the wait which was nice. Food is pretty good, I had the linguine with clams and boyfriend had ravioli. The only thing is the $3 up charge for requesting a different sauce with a pasta dish. Most restaurants don't do that in my experience. Unless you're asking for a sauce that's not even typically listed on the menu. Just seemed unnecessary, but maybe they're making it to order each time. Overall, not a bad place and decent price to try some good food."}
{"text":"Just delicious!  Great wine selection, bread /garlic butter (and as much as you want). Old school dinner style, where they serve you with a salad or soup....with the entree. Which, we had the salad, and the house dressing is great.  
Now, the entrees....they are huge!!! Plan on sharing or having leftovers for about 2 days!  Chicken Romano, with pesto, and fresh tomatoes. It was cooked perfectly.  My Halibut Piccata was exactly how I had hoped. Fish so tender, with a light, lemon/wine sauce.  Served over grilled asparagus. Delicious.  Both were served with a side of pasta!  We took home about 4 \"to go\" containers.
Prices very reasonable, for the amount of food you get, and the great quality."}
{"text":"Parking can be tricky, and the dining room is a tad small I mean u might be touching elbows with ur next door table. lol but the food was really yummy, I will return for the piccata someday.. Just wish it was a little roomier in there"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Italian spot in CLE area, came highly recommended and met all its expectations. A little small, maybe hosts 12 tables or so, would recommend making reservations in advance. 

The smells are just amazing and you grow more impatient with each minute waiting for your food to come. Service was prompt and very helpful/pleasant. What's an Italian meal that doesn't start with bread. Freshly baked, light and flaky. Hate it when some places bring out frozen butters wrapped in foil. Not this place, whipped butter with garlic and herbs. 

For main entrée, I got my usual chicken parmigiana and again asked for extra sauce. Whopping portions. Pasta al dente and fresh. Chicken tender and juicy, with perfect amount of breading. Sauce, bellisimo.

I recommend this place to all my out of town friends who want Italian"}
