{"text":"Wonderful little Joint out in Scarborough, south of UTSC and Centennial on Morningside just before you hit Kingston. I'm sure the highschool kids at West Hill are all over it already, and if not they are missing out.

Food and service were both amazing. Had a Meat Eaters Pizza special order and everything was taken care of and cooked to perfection. Definitely going to eat here again and try some of their other dishes on the menu...probably on top of another pizza order."}
{"text":"Portions were generous. The lady who made our pizza and the owner himself were super friendly. Great people working there. We got half jerk chicken and half poutine pizza, love the creative on the twist of the tradional pizza, however was a little too salty for our taste buds. Overall would give it another try in the future simply because of great service."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place five stars, which I don't do very often. I'm pleasantly surprised especially with the chicken wings in particular. I had the meat pizza which was chalk full of toppings and of the quality variety. The owner of the restaurant was also very cordial and friendly. I will be back!

I did go back on a busy Saturday night for take out and the quality of the food was much different. The wings were overcooked and the pizza was a little more on the burnt side. Perhaps when the owners away the workers can play?"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon and got the Large Meat Lovers Pizza and it had a lot of ingredients on it. The pizza was more of a thin crust, but not that crispy so the pizza would droop when I picked up a slice because of all the toppings. Overall, great combination of flavours, but a little too expensive with or without out the Groupon. When I went they were in the middle of switching to a new menu and really focusing on becoming more of a fusion style restaurant by incorporating Suya. The owner is awesome and I love what he is trying to accomplish and really hope it works out for him."}
{"text":"Been living in Scarborough for almost 2 years and this is the ONLY pizza spot I go to.

Great prices, great service and great pizza. I'm not a spicy gal, so I go for Hawaiian, Deluxe or Meat Lovers. Ingredients are very fresh. I've never had a bad pizza here. All of the meat is halal which is nice - no need for a special request or an upcharge! Makes ordering for an office lunch SO easy and you can order through UberEATS!

The staff are great. I tend to be early to pick up my pizza, but they don't mind chatting with me while I wait. Always trying to get me to try the Suya! Wish I could, I've heard it's amazing!

Can't wait to try some of their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Cute little store. Inside of the store was small but had a downtown vibe to it. There's limited seating but it works for takeout. 

Tried the poutine pizza and it was amazing. So much cheese and they use vege gravy which is great for people who are vegetarians or/and eat strictly halal. More poutine taste than pizza. Very generous on the cheese curds and gravy. I had trouble eating the 3rd slice, so filling. I'd recommend this place to anyone needing a special fix of poutine pizza! A must try."}
{"text":"Surprisingly for a pizza place it's very relaxing to go there with the music. The pizza is also very good. I like thin crust. And the boss is a very nice guy!"}
{"text":"Really good poutine. They layer shredded mozz with curds on top. It's better than I could have expected. We got their meat lovers pizza as well and their sausage is one of the best I've ever had on a pizza. It's got a really nice mild (or \"medium\" if you don't like any form of spicey food in general) spice to it, and all their meat that we got tastes like quality meat. Overall, I'm very impressed by the place. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I was honestly very disappointed with the pizza I got. Even till this point I don't understand why has every other reviews are making this place look excellent. 

My boyfriend and I decided to try out this place because of the amazing reviews. We drove here and ordered a meat lover pizza. Surprised to find out a medium pizza is over $20.. eventually we received it after a 20 mins wait, the pizza was too salty and dry.. and it's clearly over cooked because the cheese all dried up. 

I personally would not want to come back again."}
