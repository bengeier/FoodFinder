{"text":"Never again. The staff (not the waitress - she is nice) was beyond rude. Kept waiting whilst others go to go in and there was two of us.  Made to pay cash - I call income tax scam going on here. They gave some lame excuse about next day transactions - that is garbage.  Was told I can't stay long to smoke, to hurry up and get out. the table was dirty, they never bring more hot water for the tea and it was really dirty, disgusting bathrooms.  I think the couches with the pillows have bugs - that dirty and gross. I will definitely find and patronize another place where I am more welcome.  Enough people willing to take my biz in Calgary with the downturn.  Why would I go where I am not welcome. Oh yes - your game policy after 9 on week nights is nuts.  Do you really have that much business on a wednesday or thursday you can refuse people their rights?  People want to play games or didn't you get the memo?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service at 1pot n huge scammer on tips n sake bottle size. 30$ for large sake either hot or cold.  But cold ull get 1liter full, where hot ull get only half maybe at most.  because they say its harder to make after we complain.  Ooooo pressing a button on the machine is sooo hard.  And watch out when u guys do bill splitting.  They will tack on another *41% tips into the machine if others paid cash n ur paying by machine.  N they will hustle you for tip money.   Like literally.   Bill is 110 with 15% included. For 3 ppl.  But they wanted 140 total.  Wut?  Yes let me pay u extra 50$ for your bad service n attitude.  N give u that 41% tips cos u think we are stupid.  after u ripped us off,  hustle us for tips,  n treated us badly.    Spoke to us in different languages.    Actually i cant say \"they\" .  Since it was just that stupid lady that was our server.  Sucha  scammer n so stupid .   Food is great  but this place has pissed me off twice now with their ppl. Only been there twice."}
{"text":"The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because our previous visit there was actually enjoyable.  However, our recent visit there has soured me enough not to come back.  Food: 4/5 Stars Service: 1 Star Ambience: 2 Stars If you  plan on going there on a weekend, make reservations.  This place gets packed!  As most Yelpers have already described, 1 Pot is a Chinese hot pot restaurant where each seat has their own burners to heat your own hot pot.  You are given an order sheet where you can choose your soup base (sichuan pepper, beef, chicken, etc.) as well as choose your meat, carb and vegetable ingredients.  This is actually 1 Pots redeeming factor since they offer a decent variety of tasty ingredients as well as the sauce station where you can mix together a ton of different sauces together.  What turned me off completely from this place is the service.  I am used to the typical Chinatown \"snarky / blunt\" service we've all come to love.  What really irked me was I saw more brain power from zombies in a Walking Dead episode than our servers that night.!  For some unfathomable reason, I think they accidentally turned on an invisibility cloak on my gf and I's table.  They continuously gave the ingredients to the other tables surrounding us.  We had to flag them down during the ENTIRE MEAL to bring us our food when they got turned away from the other tables.  I knew it was going to be long night when our server had a clueless look on her face wandering around each table with our soup base.  Maybe you should look for the table WITHOUT a hot pot yet?  Like our table?  Add in the unapologetic attitudes and it made for an unenjoyable dining experience.  We love the concept and really enjoyed the food.  It's unfortunate that our servers seemed to have just come from a Walking Dead casting call.  I'll assume they are amazing method actors and were still in character."}
{"text":"1 Pot has been my go to AYCE hot pot restaurant since it opened but now with all the new restaurants in town I don't know how it compares. I like going to 1 Pot because you have your individual pot, there's a variety of food and there are lots of sauces to choose from. I can't go back to sharing a pot with others because the food I put into the pot always gets eaten. I've tried quite a few different soup bases but now my favorite is the tomato mushroom because after 30-45 minutes the broth gets really flavorful and tomatoy. The quality of the food is pretty good. I'm obsessed with the fried bun with condensed milk...because what's not to like?   It's a good place to bring people that haven't had hot pot before or people with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"This is the best hotpot restaurant I have been to in Calgary. I am not usually a big fan of having hotpot at a restaurant (I usually prefer eating it at home), but the experience of the meal here is quite fun. Each person gets to have their own pot!   In my opinion, the whole idea of having hotpot is to enjoy cooking your food with family and friends. Usually, a large pot of soup is shared with a group of people; everyone is provided with raw meats (seafood, beef, lamb..etc) and vegetables to which they are to cook via the hot pot of soup.   The unique idea of this restaurant (the only one in Calgary so far) is that each person gets their own pot that they can use to cook their own food. There are a variety of soup bases that you can choose from and as well, a variety of meats and vegetables. In addition to the meats and vegetables, there are also noodles and tofu. The ingredients that this restaurant provides appears to be fresh, in comparison to many hotpot places I have been to in Calgary.  What I liked about this restaurant is not only the idea of the one pot, but that the ingredients need to be ordered; hotpot restaurants are usually all you can eat (including this one) and so often the ingredients are left out in the open for hours. Additionally, you get to make your own dipping sauce!  The service at this restaurant is fairly quick and quite well-mannered for a chinese restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place for hotpot, however it is a bit on the pricer side for hotpot ($35 per person, usually its between $20-$25). Also, it is best to make a reservation...when we left there was a huge crowd of people waiting. My friend made a reservation for 6:00pm so we got seated when the restaurant opened."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was wonderful.  The staff was patient and courteous.   I would highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. i love the sauce table and we get individual pot. except meat is not fresh .. and little expensive for that."}
{"text":"One word: Cute!   An interesting Asian hot pot restaurant locate at center of Chinatown. It's all you can eat menu only, and the word \"cute\" I use, because most traditional Asian hot pot I knew are one big pot of soup broth with a stove on the table; cook the raw meat or other food produce share with group of people. But this restaurant concept was thinking outside of the box: Someone invented INVIDUAL stove with a very small size pot in front of your table, you can choose your own variety flavour of the soup from healthy vegetarian to Szechwan spicy hot soup broth.  Which also reduce cross-contamination and you don't need to share the soup broth with other people. The menu are huge selection to choose: raw meat, seafood (some are frozen), produce, noodles, hot food (wings, deep fried spring rolls etc...). There is create your own dipping sauce for increase your taste bud with your cooked food: from sweet tangy to extreme spicy chilli sauce, just locate in main entrance. Services was taken care by Asian wait staff nothing ordinary, but there is one female wait staff taking care of us acting very cutely as from her speech and greeting gesture (with a bow) make us feel differently as other Asian restaurant services attitude nor behavior. Definitely will be back again.  Tips: Reservation: especially on weekends and/or holiday. Or big groups in advance.   It all you can eat !  Order menu sheet: be caution what you order including the soup broth. Some menu item specific quantity, I ordered 1 dumpling for cooking it came in \"one unit\" of dumpling. And raw meat are cut into very thin slice maybe 1 order = 6 slice of meat per order.   There is lots of food recommend in the order sheet, but most memorable menu is a dessert (under hot food order sheet section): deep fried Asian bun with sweet condense milk (crispy outside, steamy soft bun inside, dipped with condense milk = heaven)"}
{"text":"Compare to Tampa Florida, this is a very good restaurant. I believe they are truly 4 stars restaurant may be a bit more. The restaurant name is one pot. It is truly one pot of good hot pot soup. Their special is the $13 CAD for one pot include seafood and meat. To me it is a good deal.   We have beef soup base. It is good clear soup. The meat include slice beef, shrimp, meat ball, dumpling, fish cake, tofu, cabbage, straw mushroom and more. We enjoy it very much.   We also have 5 dishes of dim sum. Monday to Thursday is half price but not today. We have the soup dumpling. It is decent compare to Tampa. If the skin can be thinner will be better. We have fried rice pack, pig feet, pig kidney and pig liver, and fried intestine. All this are good taste.   They are not too busy that time. Service serve with a smile. It was pleasant to eat there."}
{"text":"This was a really good hotpot place! You get an Individual pot (although I find all of our soup base rather bland despite the promising sounding descriptions), lots of sauce ingredients and meat options. The service could be friendlier (but that always seems to be the case in a Chinese restaurant in North America) and they could pick up the orders faster, but overall the supply pace was good to make you fully satisfied within the 2 hour dining window. Price was a bit on the expensive side. Around home we pay $20 pp for unlimited hot pot but there is less variety. I suppose that is truly what you pay extra for. Well worth a stop if you are hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Quality of food 4/5 yelps Variety 4/5 yelps see much larger options Portions 4/5 yelps smaller portions however it's all you can eat so just order more dishes.  Went after the 6pm rush so no waiting for a table on a week night."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The food is ok but the service is absolutely horrible. We even gave them 3 chances and each time the lady is not only inattentive but very very very rude. We had out of town guests on one occasion and it was embarrassing to have them treated that way. Unless you are quite tolerant, don't waste your time or money. I wished that they had negative ratings or even the ability for a zero rating. As it is, I gave it as low a review as possible. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"When I first saw 1 Pot, I was thinking that it would be another hotpot restaurant like the old Treasures of China or Hot Point. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept, but it hasn't been done this well in a long time.  First of all, every seat has their own induction burner for your very own hotpot. Add to that the plethora of broths available for just about every taste that will keep you coming back again. From the simplicity of beef, to flavourful choices like cilantro and pidan, or the incredible Sichuan \"mala\", a bubbling magma of chili oil, dried chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorn that is wonderfully spicy and numbing good.  For one price, you get the whole run of the menu including meats, vegetables, seafood, tofus, fish pastes, dumplings and more.   The icing on the cake comes with the incredible sauce bar that includes 15 housemade sauces in addition to the fixings to create your own.   The service here is also good, as the servers are happy to help you make your dining experience a good one. Great work, 1 Pot!"}
{"text":"Had extra work to do after work hours with colleagues. But we were hungry and figured we could do it over dinner. 1 Pot was recommended and as I had never had Korean style hot pot I was definitely up for it. They were really great about giving us some time to finish off the work part before we got to the cooking part. As we went straight after work it was quiet but by 6pm it was packed with people waiting. They take reservations so would highly recommend that if you turn into a hungry monster and cant wait.  1. Start by picking your soup base - all 3 of us had different ones and all delicious. We ended up eating truly asian style by stealing each other food out of the pots so really cant remember which base I preferred but they were all tasty.  2. Choose the items you want to cook in it. Ordering was left up to my collegue who had been there before so we ended up with things I would never have thought of - like quails eggs. We had mussels, shrimp, noodles, veg, beef, lamb, chicken, fish paste things and a bunch of others I don't remember.  3. They also have this sauce buffet - take one, take 2 or mix and match and make your own combo. Not gonna lie that I had a mix of sesame paste and hoisin. Everything was dunked in it. Would have licked the bowl clean - that stuff is amazing!  Dessert didn't happen cause we ate everything and then ate a little more, so no space left.  Heard they have great specials that they advertise on their facebook page. In July they had their All u Can Eat Menu, only $19.99 per person!! Now that's some deal! Would go back regardless of any deals they have on."}
{"text":"Really nice for individual hot pot. Lots of sauce and condiments to choose from. Superbase is on the salty side though. Friendly staff very welcoming they take reservations which is an added bonus for weekends and big groups. Would go again."}
{"text":"Did you know that if you didn't tip enough,  that they would actually stand there and stare at you,  asking you why you don't tip enough.  You're kidding right?  How unprofessional.  Alright food,  rude service,  horrible personality (particularly one waitress). You call this a business right?  What a joke!"}
{"text":"After hitting my early 30's I thought \"yeah it's time to leave somethings behind in my 20's\". Stuff like cheesy pick up lines, t-shirts with quirky graphic and artwork from \"fav local indie band\", sociopath clown-make-up \"friends\", and abusing my body at the All-You-Can-Eat joints.  Yes growing up is making peace with your stomach and gut. *cue Buddhist gong*  INSTEAD, I decided to grow down and throw away adulthood when I went to 1Pot, not only once...but THRICE! Allow me to summarize all three visits for you:  1. I stumbled in here after me and my gf decided we were \"pekkish\" and were in the mood for small snacks. Five pounds of meat later we began the \"YOU DID THIS TO ME!\" blame-game which was kindly interrupted by 1pot's manager, who suggested we make room for their amazing mango tapioca pudding.  2. Two weeks later I joined the Yelp Crew and decided to handle myself with poise and manners. Nope- not the case, I butchered everything that came and once again challenged the limits of how many angus beef and octopus I can consume. Oh all of that cuttlefish paste please!  3. XX amount days later I returned with my high school buddies in hopes of reviving our lost days of gastro-debauchery. We tapped out in the first round. Granted I assumed 1pot would treat us like most AYCE joints and skimp out on certain orders by the second round. So we made our first round as heavy as it can be in meats and all the juicy tasty things that would bankrupt any foolish restaurant stand and we wanted it right MEOW. But 1Pot is not run by fools. Instead they brought out what began as a dreamland of yum-yum and turned it into our slow, crawling, mouth-agape-food-hanging-on-our-chin-distant-look NIGHTMARE.  Also let me tell you a secret. Get their mango pudding and mango tapioca. It's off menu but it's the PERFECT dessert. So light and fresh."}
{"text":"Ah, I'm pretty impressed with the hot pot selection at 1 Pot. I went based on a recommendation from someone in the industry plus Dale E, Ange and Jay D (all three who I are always dead on about good food in the city).  Stay away from the Schezuan broth unless you have an iron stomach. I was sweating - as in droplets coming off my face and neck - the whole time. It was pretty embarrassing, I swiped extra napkins off an adjacent table. I know if you let sweat drip off and not wipe it off, it will cool you down. However, my pride got in the way, hence the extra napkins.  Yummy dishes: fried spring rolls (nice filling); shrimp and fish paste (good flavour); wonton (crunchy, good texture, sweet); oysters (very small but fresh); taro, Korean cake, and nice veggies.   Price is right - about $30 for all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-gain. I'll be back, though I want to try the hot pot at Regency and retry hot pot at the Chinese Cultural Restaurant.   Insider tip: Don't go here if you are on a first date. If you're like me, it will probably be your last."}
{"text":"I love Pho, I love ramen and I love fondue! I had never been to a hot pot before, but I quickly learned that it is a beautiful, flavourful and OH SO SPICY (in my case - medium sichuan...damn, that's spicy) smash-up/medly of all these things.  1. Pick your soup base. They have SO many to choose from. You can go with more traditional hot pot soups or go ramen style with miso or tonkotsu, or even give it a Thai twist with a green curry. After hearing from one of the guys at our table the mild sichuan soup he ordered was quite mild, I opted for the medium which on first sip immediately brought tears to my eyes, steam to my ears, and a runniness to my nose. If you like spicy - go for it! If not? Stay the heck away from this one! Several people were enjoying sipping on their soup at the end of the meal. I didn't - that would have been like trying to drink straight fire.  2. Pick the stuff you want to cook in it! You order off of a sushi type tick card. I was hungry and I'll eat anything so I didn't even look at the card. From what showed up at our table, I can only assume that you can actually order everything - every single thing to cook in your soup. We had snails, whole shrimp, a lot of beef things, noodles, veggies, fish, pork things, fish paste things, wontons, cuttle fish, tripe and all sorts of mystery meats.  3. Go to the sauce buffet and just go to town. Take a bunch of different bowls or just take one bowl and load it with a bunch of different sauces! After putting that spicy sichuan in my mouth, I had no idea what I was eating. According to many people at the table, the satay sauce is unreal. Personally, I was in love with the sesame paste topped off with hoisin. It helped cool my mouth down.  Huge props to those little asians donut things that come with sweetened condensed milk for you to dip it in.  The whole experience was so fun. The service was so kind and friendly. The food is exciting and plentiful. But like every all-you-can-eat place I've ever been to, I wind up wondering what could have been with set portions but at a higher quality. That's what would give it that coveted 5th star. No matter how good the food was, the quality still felt like an all-you-can eat place... which it is... so there's that.  Huge thanks to Nyssa M. for organizing this UYE so I could try my first Hot Pot! http://www.yelp.ca/user_details?userid=zXWSgcYLdVr0mpwtDsXiaw"}
{"text":"Calgary at 14F? Hot pot must be pretty popular here, if not a basic necessity.  The first thing that hit me when I entered was the odor - don't wear your nice clothes here, or they will smell of that odor. The odor will go away after a few days. Otherwise, it's an okay hot pot place. The seafood is frozen, of course... this is Calgary, not Vancouver. Note that some of the items are seriously per item, rather than per serving - you have to order the exact number of mushrooms, exact number of shrimp, exact number of oysters, exact number of tiny steamed buns. Meanwhile, some items are by the bunchful, so that's rather confusing.   The chicken feet is awful... tougher than a rubber doggy bone."}
{"text":"All you can eat hot pot with a varied menu. Other Yelpers have left thorough descriptions of the ordering process, so I won't repeat that.  Recently visited on a Friday after work for an early supper. The restaurant was only about 1/4 full. With that, service was quick with minimal waits for new orders of dishes.  My favourite add-ins are the sliced beef and lamb. Love the sauce buffet; really enjoyed sauces based on the garlic chili sauce."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, this is just the wrong venue. With astronomical prices and a limited selection of available vegetarian ingredients, I felt like I wasn't getting value out of my order. For meat eaters the place seems great, and the all you can eat can be worth it if you're hungry enough or there for a special event.   The restaurant itself is loud but pleasant to be in. Service was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.    1 Pot is an AYCE hot pot restaurant with a twist - you get your own pot of broth rather than sharing communal pots of broth.  There is an extensive list of soups to choose from although there is an additional charge for most soups.  It would be nice if your own pot of broth had a divider down the middle so that you can choose two soups for yourself.  After you pick your broth, then you pick your food from a list, which is also quite extensive, although on the night I went, there were some delicious items that they ran out of (including lobster balls!).  Missing from the list is watercress, which is my absolute favourite food to eat at hot pot and there is an additional charge for enoki mushrooms.  Hot pot at the cultural central always has watercress and enoki mushrooms - all included!  There is a well-laid out sauce station with everything you'd need.  There is also cooked food available - I recommend the chicken wings and fried buns with condensed milk.  Delicious!  After your meal, ask for the off-the-menu mango tapioca cold soup-like dessert.  It is refreshing and the perfect end to the sodium-laden meal."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting 1 Pot for lunch time, and I cannot recommend it enough!  It's very \"food court style\" at lunch time. When you walk in, there is a server manning the cash register, who you order off of. You are then given a number which is to be called out by the man packing up lunches at the kitchen opening. You can grab a seat anywhere, and when your number is called, you walk up to pick up your lunch tray, where you can then head over to the condiments/tea/water table to pick up your essentials.  They have a variety of lunch options - For $5.95 you can get your meat of choice on a bed of rice or chilled noodles (either option comes with a soup). For $6.95, you can get a bowl of pho noodles. On top of that, 1 Pot has listed their more popular 1 Pot snack plates for $2.50 (fried chicken wings, curry fish balls, fried buns with condensed milk). It's definitely a great deal here, especially on a weekday when a visit to the food court will easily cost you $10.  I got their curry beef brisket on rice, and gave in to getting their fried chicken wings. The curry and beef brisket was well done, but the rice was old and most likely leftovers from the previous day (but I can't complain when it's priced at $5.95). I got 3 well-sized chicken wings and it was just as I remembered it. It was made-to-order, so freshly deep-fried.  I will definitely return. It might be a trek from work but definitely beats the food court options available.  Tip: It takes only debit and cash at lunch time (After 2pm, cash only)."}
{"text":"I don't find it as good as the first time I tried it in 2014. Maybe after having Mongolian Hot Pot I felt that the quality there was much better. Drinks are not included in the price. I mean, if it's all you can eat why not make it all you can drink chrysanthemum and/or prune juice since filling up on liquids means filling up less on meat stuff??? No watercress, no enoki mushrooms included in the price (not that I even got any even though I marked it down for $2 extra!) Half price children aged 3-11. Really??? My 5 year old eats like a bird and does not get his $15 worth of food I can tell ya that much!! Maybe divide the age group from 3-7 for ¼ of the price and 8-11 for  1/2 price. Sheesh! Can't even go out to dinner with my kids without feeling the wrath of being overcharged!! It smells weird as should be expected from all that simmering broth I guess. I wouldn't recommend it here anymore. If you come on a weekend expect waits of 2 hours more."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleague and when we walked through the door the waitress thought we wanted dim sum. For dim sum you order and pay and sit anywhere to eat it. We told her we are here for hotpot. So we were given a menu - lunch combo for $15.99. Right now they are doing a promo for $13.99 lunch special hot pot. Same menu.   So I got the Chinese Herbal wine soup with lamb and plum juice. For desert, I got the mango pudding. The hotpot also comes with a side that has a variety of things ranging from shrimp, fishballs to lettuce, tofu and etc.   We also get to make our own sauce which had many different items. I was amazed at the sauce option. It has so much stuff. I made the perfect sauce for myself.   I love the meat. Too bad it only has 6 slices of lamb. Would be great if they have more. Overall, I was left full and I had a great time eating it. I liked the food.  Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already. Today we came with a group of 16 and they were able to accommodate us super fast. We did find a melting ice cream sandwich on one of our chairs, but the servers were quite apologetic and quickly cleaned it up.   There's a small selection of basic broths for each person to choose from, with a premium selection of soups for $2 more. The condiment bar was well stocked, albeit we were provided with small plastic condiment cups for our sauces. Therefore several trips were required to get out fill of condiments. So happy that they had green onions and garlic on their condiment bar :)  The selection of hot pot food was plenty. Mounds of fatty beef and pork, with the occasional basket of veggies and platters of seafood dotted our table. We tend to always order too much... But for sure none of us went home hungry.   There's also a small selection hot eats as well, so you have something to munch on when your food is cooking. Their curry fish balls and curry squid aren't too spicy, great for a quick snack before your main meal.   My love here is of course their deep fried buns drizzled in condensed milk. I could eat a moutain of them! They come out piping hot, so be super careful before biting into one. The mango pudding and mango tapioca desserts aren't listed on their order sheet. Be sure to ask the servers for these to end your meal."}
{"text":"All the other reviews have already explained what hot pot is so this review is just going to tell you how to get the most amount of food out or your experience at 1 Pot because why else would you go to an all you can eat place. Please don't judge me.   1. My mom says that hot pot orginated in Sichuan, which I don't think is actually true but anyway, people there love spicy food. Like super love. In Sichuan people eat hot pot in the summer so that they can sweat a lot and thereby cool off. It is insane. If you order a spicy broth and you are not used to crazy Sichuan levels of spicyness go for the \"small\" level of spice. Even my crazy spice-loving friends got \"medium\" and they were crying. I have never seen someone get \"big\" spice. If you are crying and drinking water you cannot also be stuffing your face - which is the point right?    2. If you check in on Facebook they will give you the deluxe hot pot menu for the same price as the original. The deluxe includes some extra dim sum dishes (like egg-custard buns, which are soooo good).   3. They are actually quite strict about their two hour limit and although they won't kick you out they won't let you order anything else. The wait staff probably won't pay much attention to you after your first few orders so if you want more food you'll have to actively flag them down.   4. I feel terrible saying this as a vegetarian but don't order a ton of leafy vegetables (eg. lettuce, cabbage, etc) because they will bring you a huge basket of it. Also, if you ordered a spicy broth I would not recommend cooking any vegetables in the soup unless you are really brave because they tend to collect all the chili oil and there's no real buffer against the spice so you and your mouth will probably just die.  5. Order just one of an item to try it. You might also want to confirm that the thing you want is called what you think it is when reordering. Most of their deluxe dim sum items were delicious (according to my friends) and fried steamed buns are also great. Otherwise, I think it's better to forgo the pre-cooked stuff and stick to hot pot. Normally at home, we don't cook starchy things like noodles until the end because they will soak up all the broth and at that point you're probably too full for noodles anyway.   In conclusion, hot pot is a fun experience that I always associate with happy times with family and friends. Try everything that sounds interesting even if you don't know what it is! You might regret it but you can just hide the leftovers in your soup pot if you don't like it. I'm just kidding!!!!!! Please don't actually waste food like that; they will get mad and wasting food is bad for everyone. Have fun!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE.  Right when you walk in, a wall of shrimp paste aroma hits you.  Everyone smelled of shrimp paste when we left.  The service is horrendous, staff just walk around but don't acknowledge you.  We had Hot Pot, we ordered a bunch of food that never arrived and had a bunch of food arrive that we never ordered.    Our hot pots were never refilled with water, in fact, we had to use our drinking water out of our plastic cups to refill our own hot pots.  Some of the hot pots were malfunctioning and spontaneously turned off and it was hard to get a rolling boil despite the temperature being on high.    NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"1Pot, 1Price for a great meal especially on a cold day.  Price is $25.99/person - all you can eat.  You tick off items off on a list - pick your soup base, pick your meat, seafood, vegetables, dumplings, carbs like noodles, rice, tofu, pork blood.  Very good food.  Great wait service.  I love the \"sauce buffet\" like preserved bean curd sauce (foo-yee), satay sauce, xo sauce, ground garlic, ground ginger, ground red chili, and the list goes on and on.    We opted for the beef broth, load of beef, lamb, prawns, tofu, lobster balls, shrimp balls, \"tong-oh\" & \"sue Choy\" vegetable, dumplings, sticky rice, seasoned rice, clear vermicelli.  At the end, the soup is so delicious to drink as all the wonderful essence of the meat, seafood and vege are all blended into the broth. For an added price of $6.95, we decided to get a jug of plum drink - helps cool you down with all the hot food.  There is a time limit of 2 hours and everything ordered must be eaten.    Love cooking from my own hot pot!  Great concept!"}
{"text":"Came here with family on a Sunday night and it wasn't packed at all. Walked in and was greeted right away. Right off the bat I already see this lady who I assume is the manager and I've got to say she is quite unwelcoming. Even through out our meal most of the staff would drop off our food and not even say anything. They wouldn't tell us what they brought us anything;  Hot pot was soso. We were so excited by how many varieties of soup broths they offered but it turned it they were out of a lot of the soups we wanted. They were out of a lot of items as well.  The sauces they had were good I might add and plus 1 star for keeping it nice and maintained. Food was okay too. I liked my chicken and chili pepper broth.   Overall a solid 3 stars for me."}
