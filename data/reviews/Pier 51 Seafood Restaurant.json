{"text":"I was hoping for more.
The flounder tasted like it had been frozen for a while. 
Salad bar was average and the service was too.
Not planning on returning, but maybe it's better at other times."}
{"text":"We have eaten at leat 10 times since opening in Sept/Oct 2015 We have brought friends from as far as Waxhaw to dine with us. They are actually bringing thier son and daughter-in-law tommorow from Waxhaw to dine.
The service has always been very good. The seafood is the best in Concord. I have seen their Steaks being delivered to nearby tables and often wonder if I should have tried the Beef fare.Those tables were very happy with their selection.
Prices are in line with other seafood resturants in Harrisburg/NE CLT and better service and food. We have been for late lunch and dinner with the same fine service and food."}
{"text":"Shrimp, flounder, and white fish was great. My whole family enjoyed their meals. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"great portions and really fair prices. Flounder for lunch best deal going, soup salad hush puppies 3 good sized filets and a side for $7.00 calabash style."}
{"text":"Wonderful little fish camp style restaurant. I took my mother here for mother's day. She had the Alaskan whitefish, my husband had the sea scallops, and I had the Calabash shrimp. They were all cooked to a crisp brown perfection. My husband said his scallops were sweet just like at the coast. The prices were surprisingly reasonable and the service was outstanding. Another great surprise all entres included a full salad. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Typical southern seafood camp but very friendly and clean. The fried oysters are fantastic. The fries were not so good as they tasted of old oil. Otherwise tasty."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices.  Server was attentive and the food portions were very generous."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service by a very friendly group of people. Thanks Laura & Pam for a good first, hopely not to be the last, dining experience."}
{"text":"I wanted seafood tonight, which is rare but does happen occasionally. I knew there was a restaurant in Concord that served seafood and had fairly good ratings so I thought we should give it a try.
I've never had more bland food in my life. The fact that we were the only non grey hairs there should have been a dead giveaway but we soldiered on.
The salad bar was decent and the hush puppies kept the kids quiet but the actual entrees left much to be desired. The only flavor I tasted was fried. That's not a flavor, it's a preparation. The waitress was attentive and friendly but what she was serving did not make up for her kindness.
Maybe I should have done as the table beside ours and ordered crab legs. I mean you can't mess up crab legs right?"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, this was a Chinese Buffet. Big Improvement.

This location has been many things over the years but generally set up for a Buffet.

At the same time, Pier 51 was always an excellent Seafood Restaurant on NC Hwy 51 aka Pineville- Matthews Road hence the name.

Since this location opened as a Pier 51, I've wanted to try it and today we were in the Concord area doing some last minutes shopping and ended up here.

Still in the last stages of remodeling with the outside being given another coat of fresh paint but the place is looking good with an attractive make over.

Walked in and were immediately seated. Since I am on crutches due to a hip injury, they seated me at a nice booth with easy access to everything.  

Loved the menu with something for everyone.

Nice salad bar and we both started with that. Limited selection of dressings but they do have all of the basics.

I ordered the create your own combo with Salt and Pepper Catfish and Oysters prepared the same way with a baked potato with butter and sour cream.

Excellent choice, particularly the oysters

Wife had stuffed crabs with friend okra. Must say their portion sizes are generous.

Almost a standard NC fish camp atmosphere which made for a great dining experience.

Our server was excellent the whole time we were there,"}
{"text":"Ate lunch with my family of six. Disappointing buffet - ho hum salad bar and everything else was fried. Hardly any vegetables at all. It cost $90. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"What a wonderful Sunday buffet. We had broiled tilapia, fried catfish, fried chicken, brocolli casserole, pineapple casserole, fried potatoes. All of it looked well stocked and fresh. And also a nice fresh salad bar and friendly service too! We'll be back next Sunday."}
{"text":"I will not be going back here again. 8.99 for one piece of fish and a small handful of shrimp is not acceptable. ( this was their special)  I called to complain and question this small portion and basically the manager didn't care that he had a very unhappy customer . So I won't be giving them my money and the scrap of food wasn't even good ."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we were not disappointed! The food was excellent...plenty of it too! The salad bar is included with the entree. The flounder, shrimp and deviled crab were outstanding. Our waitress, Allie, did a great job with keeping our drinks filled. We will definitely go back. Be sure you try it!"}
{"text":"The best seafood around. We used to go to Linebergers in Belmont with our family growing up as kids. They have the best green shrimp. 
Tarter sauce, slaw & hush puppies are to die for."}
{"text":"Just came for the first time and so glad we did.  It is Sunday and Buffet is from 11-4 for $10.  Everything was great.  It isn't full of seafood but plenty of fish and shrimp.  Salad bar portion was fresh, veggies flavored well and not too much salt.  Fish was moist, not overcooked.  Try the ribs and country style steak, they both melt in your mouth and the flavor is wonderful.  Service was great, Amanda was both attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is about what you would expect for a so-so buffet place. They had vat after vat of like warm fried food and a couple of tubs of over cooked veggies. The worst part was that it cost me $90 to feed the family. I could have gone to a real restaurant and still paid less than that. 

For the money, this place is not a good deal and the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This place has become our favorite seafood place in Charlotte .Always fresh seafood ,always crispy ,great service with family atmosphere and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time at Pier51. Made reservations. The place was very busy. My friend and I were seated quickly. I liked that people were exiting from a different door than those entering. That helps with the flow. Once seated, I opened my menu. IT WAS FILTHY! I didn't want to touch it. I've often heard the dirtiest thing in restaurants is the menu but this was the worst I seen. They are laminated, should be wiped after use. They have a salad bar. I am not a fan of them. To many people touching, coughing or sneezing around a salad bar. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered and meals came quickly. My friend asked for butter, REAL BUTTER, not the oily spread or chemically laden margirin that was at the table. Then he asked for a CLEAN knife. While the waitress was doing that, I pulled mine out of the paper package it was in. Mine wasn't clean! I could hear the waitress behind me, going through some other table wear, saying No, not that one, nope not that.........
The portions of the meal are ample. I could eat it all. But then I filled up on the hushpuppies they brought before the meal. They were good, not the best I've had, but good. I was to full to try any dessert. Hearing the waitress tell others their dessert choices was tempting. I'm love my sweets! Perhaps another time.
Overall, this restaurant is OK. They could up the cleaning. Their staff is very nice, friendly. Very busy when we were there. Worth the try."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Buffet,  fish was very tasty also had meatloaf and ribs also good.  The fried chicken was the best I have ever had on a buffet.  I had an extra piece in place of dessert and I love dessert.  Service was fine  and price was fair.  Don't forget to ask for the senior discount.  Will be back."}
{"text":"What a perfect homestyle family friendly seafood restaurant. 

When you first walk in you will be greeted by a friendly hostess. Restaurant have two sides. It's pretty big. The prices are not to pricey. 

One of the things that I love about this restaurant is that on Saturdays ( I don't know if it's  everyday thing) they have a ALL CAN EAT SALAD BAR WITH YOUR MEAL!!!!!!! How Awesome"}
{"text":"This was the BEST seafood I've had here in awhile!!!  Blows mayflower away!!!
Extremely happy."}
{"text":"Calabash shrimp was amazing!! Disappointed in the salad buffet selection, but still had nice toppings. Great homemade ranch (I do not know if it is premade or homemade, but it was delicious)"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight with the family. Very good New England clam chowder.

Hush puppies were tasty (even if they were not hot.) Small but nice salad bar (selection was small but everything was fresh.)

I had broiled flounder and scallops. Very good and very hot. 

Others had shrimp and scallops... Stuffed flounder... Chicken strips.... Everyone enjoyed the food.

On top of that, found out our sever, Jess, grew up in the same city were recently moved from (a year ago) about 5 blocks from our house! Very friendly, and efficient... Was constantly checking on us without being intrusive. 

We will visit again."}
{"text":"Great seafood! The flounder is amazing! The service is excellent. The Sunday Buffet is delicious. 
Their lunch specials are great too.

{"text":"We decided to eat her for Father's Day after my dad saw an ad in the newspaper about their new buffet on Sundays. This restaurant used to be located only about 15 mins from our church but it's now about an hour away so we were all starving when we got here. We were pleasantly surprised and it was TOTALLY worth the trip!! I imagined the buffet would be full of options that all lacked flavor, but this was the farthest from the truth! Everything was seasoned very well and cooked perfectly! The staff was friendly and the buffet was kept clean and never low on items. I would HIGHLY recommend you eat here. It's worth the drive!! The prices are also extremely reasonable!

In addition to the food, the bathroom was pristine! I'm very particular about the cleanliness of restrooms and was pleased with how well it was being kept clean and maintained. We have already talked about coming back to enjoy the buffet in the near future!!"}
{"text":"I thought i already did a review on this place...excellent value great quality and they give u large portions!!!Go to this place if your a true seafood lover this is ur spot for real do the all u can eat if ur \"a true seaford player\""}
{"text":"Perfect perfect perfect, experienced the best service & wonderful food. Got the sirloin/shrimp combo & i definitely recommend it! Steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, & seasoning on the vegetables was just right. Fast & good dining"}
{"text":"Very good !  Fish was excellent, fresh and a tremendous amount to satisfy anyone. I had flounder and calabash shrimp. Salad bar is good, not the best.  Place is clean and bright inside. 
My only complaint is that they serve a \"spread\" instead of a real butter ( crappy tasting at that) they do have real sour cream yet go cheap on the other.   It's a shame, I even asked if they had some for people, only if they asked ."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and every visit was consistently good.  The portion size usually has me asking for a to go box when I leave.  The price is reasonable.  The place appears to be clean.  The quality of food is good.  I love their flounder.  The salad bar is simple but fresh.  I have always had great service, especially when Deanna is our server."}
