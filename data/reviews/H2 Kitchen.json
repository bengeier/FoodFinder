{"text":"I was invited to try H2 Kitchen during their soft opening. The poke immediately caught my eye and we ordered the Hokkaido Dive (it has uni!!) and the Salmon x Tako poke. Surprisingly, I liked the Salmon x Tako poke much better than the Hokkaido Dive. I think the ponzu sauce worked much better with the salmon than the tuna. We also tried the Thai Style with Shrimp noodle bowl, but I found that lacking in Thai flavour. Their prices are a bit higher than other poke places in the area, but their portions make up for it. I would visit again to try their other poke dishes."}
{"text":"h2kitchen has just opened its doors.  I tried some items from their menu and I can say that from the first bite you can taste the freshness and the high quality of the ingredients that are really well balanced so none of them stands out too much on the other. The drink section has also something surprisingly good to try. Definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"Went to this poke bowl place on a snowy day. It's quite spacious. I like that they put all the ingredients in front of you and you can tell how fresh they are. This place features healthy food. They gave you an apple as a side. How cute is that! We got a uni/ tuna bowl. The portion was huge! I couldn't finish it.. There was uni, a pile of tuna, half an avocado and veggies on sushi rice. So good!!! We also tried the salad and smoothie. The very berry smoothie could feed two people as a dessert. Yummy and healthy. I will definitely come back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance (casual & clean). Seating space is ample. There were a couple of people there using their laptops since there's wi-fi.   The optional membership is $5 per year (I think), and it gives you about $1 discount per meal. Each dish is about 11-16, and they all come with a fresh fruit.  I really enjoyed the thai curry soup bowl. It was a heaping portion, and it was quite flavourful. I was worried that the shrimp in the soup would be overcooked since I'm picky with shrimp, but it was actually very good! The salmon poke salad was also good. My husband really enjoyed the kimchi soup.  For the soup, you're able to get rice noodles (of the thick and round variety), or wheat noodles (soba), or zucchini noodles for an extra charge.  It's very fast too, since you go up to the counter, order and pay, and once it's ready they call your name from the kitchen, and hand you your tray from a little window."}
{"text":"Visited this place during soft opening, tried the smoked salmon toast , Hokkaido dive and dancing Bombay , and green tea latte.  Was very impressed with the quality and fresh ingredients. It tasted fresh and the sauce was unique.  Love the ambience. Service was awesome ! Green tea latte was to die for, temperature and the taste was just perfect ! Will definitely come back again ."}
{"text":"Another great place to have some poké cravings satisfied! Honestly I'm starting think these sushi-like places are one of my favourites. Nothing too different to compare with other similar shops but they taste soooo good! It's like a salad but with sashimi and a japanese twist!  Found this place on Yelp so decided to try it out with a friend and OBVIOUSLY LOOOOVED IT! What makes this place pretty cute is that when you walk in and see their counter and menus, they also have this shelf area with small pots of plants all lined up in rows. I'm actually assuming they pick and grow them because I'm pretty sure I saw some alfalfa sprouts back there! Kind of neat and shows they are using fresh ingredients to put into your order!  I went with the Tokyo Drift poké bowl and just got a replacement of the imitation crab with more kimchi (cuz I loooove kimchi! :P). Honestly, what more can I say? Everything tasted awesome! Another place to add to my list of poké shops/restaurants that I know are not a disappointment! Another cute thing I found is that with every order you get an apple too! Green or red, the choice is yours!  I had a pleasant experience here and the people there were accomodating to my request and friendly! So if you haven't tried poké bowls yet and are nearby, have a go at it here! Expoooose yourself to this delicious fusion of a cuisine!! (If I can call it that!)"}
{"text":"Went to visit them during their soft opening. Their grand opening is February 22.  The clean and simple interior made the restaurant bright and spacious. Upon entering, you see a wall of greenery with neon lights \"Healthy is my style\". They're all about getting those healthy vibes going. I particularly like the use of sky blue in their designs on the tables as well as the booth chairs and framed quotes on the walls. One of them was \"my summer body is in progress\" and \"new day new goal\". I could relate very well to these and I'm sure a lot of people can too! Another great thing about the restaurant is that there is an open fridge of fresh produce. They come in every day. There are also glass jars on shelves with grains and other dried ingredients.   I ordered two poke bowls (Hokkaido Dive & the Salmon x Tako), the Thai Style with Shrimp Noodle Bowl, as well as a Peach, Pineapple, Turmeric Greek Yogurt Smoothie.  The Hokkaido Dive is poke bowl topped with uni. This signature poke bowl definitely takes poke bowls to another level. All the ingredients were very nicely placed and even have edible flowers, making it very beautiful. The uni is very fresh and creamy. There are black cavier. Uni has a distinct flavour so if you're not a fan of it, this may not be the poke bowl for you. However, if you are a fan, I highly recommend trying this. I had this with sushi rice.  The Salmon x Tako is pretty similar to the Hokkaido Dive, except it is made with salmon and tako (octopus) slices. Again, there's a pretty edible flower. I had this with a brown rice base.   In both of the poke bowls, I really enjoyed how they used spiralized red and golden beets. I prefer this rather than the crispy taro bits at other poke places. This adds points for me for sure. They also each had a fresh baby scallop.  The Thai Style Noodle bowl is a good option for people who want something warm and soupy. I opted for the soba noodles. You can also get it with rice vermicelli. The flavour is light and simple and not over powering. There were a lot of ingredients like bok choy, five spiced tofu cubes, shrimps, purple cabbage, just to name a few.   Lastly, the Peach, Pineapple, Turmeric Greek Yogurt Smoothie was really tasty. I enjoyed how they used greek yogurt for the smoothie because it provided a more rich and thicker texture. The pineapple flavour was most prominent, with hints of turmeric and peach which I liked. If you've never had turmeric and want to try it for its healthy benefits, I recommend trying this as it doesn't have the \"hit you in the face\" of too much turmeric.   The power plugs are also at every table in a cube shape so there are a few plugs at one location. There are also some USB plugs on the cubes. It's very convenient for doing some work while enjoying healthy foods.   Overall, this is the place to be if you want some high quality, fresh, and healthy foods. Especially some colourful, Insta worthy poke bowls that are aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Wanna get a free apple? Come to H2 Kitchen!  ^_^  Today I went to H2Kitchen after postponing it many times.  They have a special deal \"Buy 1 Get 1 Free\" offered during March 16 - 18, 2018 in support of Nutrition Month.  It was a very good deal, indeed!  At first, my husband wanted to get a noodle bowl but I told him that I heard their soup wasn't good as their poke bowls.  So, we ended up ordering 2 large sizes of poke bowls.  We got HOKKAIDO DIVE and SPICY SALMON.   I ordered after hearing from yelpers how good it was and yes, there was UNI!  The Hokkaido Dive bowl is more expensive than the Spicy Salmon bowl.  So we paid for $17 for the Hokkaido Dive and got the Spicy Salmon bowl for free.  The total was $20.29 for 2 poke bowls.  It was perfect!  FOOD (3.5 stars) Their poke bowls ingredients were very fresh and the portions were generous. However, the regular price of Hokkaido Dive is a bit higher than other poke bowls.  I understand that it's because of different main ingredients like Uni, Black Caviar and Baby scallop. Anyway, I found that I prefer the Spicy Salmon bowl than the Hokkaido Dive.  I love my food to be a bit spicy ;) It makes me eat more!  SERVICE (4 stars) The lady who prepared our poke bowls were nice and friendly.  Oh! She was cute too lol  I would come back again to try new recipes by Dietitians of Canada.  I'm thinking to get Avocado Mango & Black Bean Salad or Taco Soup next time.  ^^ And maybe I'm gonna check out their noodle bowls too.  I really want to know how their broths are.    FUN FACT I dropped my apple on the floor (- _- ')  because I played with it too much lol"}
{"text":"H2 Kitchen is currently soft opening and I came here for lunch with a couple of friends. They focus on offering healthy foods that are made with fresh ingredients but are also tasty.    I tried one of their signature items - the Hokkaido Dive which is a Uni Tuna poke bowl and is limited to only 20 orders per day! They are the first restaurant to offer uni in their poke bowl and it was very delicious. I love how the sauce is given on the side as many times the sauce tends to be overpowering and cannot taste the ingredients properly.   I also tried the Korean Style with Chicken noodle bowl which came with protein packed ingredients such as roasted chicken, five spice tofu, edamame, etc. The kimchi gave the soup a nice flavour and it was not too spicy.   The interior is very clean and modern with spacious seating. There are a plethora of electrical plugs and is an excellent place to hang out with friends. There is also an exercise ball and some dumbbells inside the restaurant to promote a healthy and active lifestyle.     Overall I would be back again to try their other poke and grain bowls!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had a really good experience. From my arrival to my departure everyone at H2 was incredible! I told them I had a food allergy and the chef spoke with me to determine which dishes I could order. He happily accommodated my diet and made my experience quite wonderful.   I ordered the Bhel on the Run salad bowl and it was presented beautifully in a recyclable paper bowl. They subbed out some of the sauces and ingredients I couldn't digest and replaced them with beets and edamame. This salad typically comes with chickpeas, cauliflower, roasted potato, white onion, arugula, corn, red onion, cherry tomatoes, carrots, coconut dressing (I substituted this for the siracha maple dressing) and tamarind dressing.   The flavour combination was quite wonderful. This dish featured warm foods including the cauliflower, which made this the perfect dish on a cold Spring Day.   The restaurant is a great place for people to dine while working. They have electric sockets at each table so you can charge your devices and they provide guests with free wi-fi.   The restaurants interior is really long and narrow with bright lighting. It's definitely a great spot to grab a healthy breakfast, lunch or dinner.   They even have a membership club where you can save on future orders. This would be great if you live or work in the area. I will definitely return to H2 Kitchen next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great effort to have a hip poke place. I also understand how hard it is to start and run a restaurant. But I don't think you should open one before you're ready. Walking in, the place was almost empty, yet my friend and I were ignored for almost 5 minutes before we could place our orders. When the orders came, even though I ordered before my friend, his was ready 1st. After he customized his, it turned out he actually customized MINE instead of his. (he asked for no onions). They refused to make me a fresh one, and made me just take my friend's. And they didn't even apologize for THEIR mistake. My appetite was completely ruined by this horrible experience. Come check this place out while they last, coz they won't.  UPDATE: 2018/2/25 The very nice and professional PR representatives of H2 reached out to me thanking for my feedback and apologizing for my experience. They also offered to make it up to me, and invited me back. Looking back, I was perhaps rather harsh with my words. I believe in second chances. Perhaps I'll re-visit in a few months and try again."}
{"text":"Visited this place during their Buy-1-Get-1 deal. I was expecting more people but during the hour that I stayed there were probably only a few groups of people coming and going.  Overall, brightly lit restaurant, lots of seating. Tables, booths, high seats. There's even one of those exercise balls sitting in a corner which you can choose to sit on if you wish. And of course, I did, because where else can you experience a meal while sitting on a ball.  On the menu, they offer poke bowls, salad bowls, noodle soup bowls, and some drinks including a variety of teas and fresh pressed juices.  The ordering process was fairly straightforward: pick an item from the menu, specify a base, choose an apple, give your name, and you're done. When the poke bowl is prepared they will call you over to ask for extra garnishes on top.  I ordered a Spicy Salmon poke bowl and a Thai curry noodle soup.  I started with the noodle soup, and halfway through it, I started wondering why there were pieces of chicken and kimchi, which seemed like an interesting choice for thai-style soup. Although it was already a free bowl due to the promotion, I still went and asked about it. One of the staff tried to convince me that this was the thai noodle soup, and that the white bowls are used for a korean soup while the black bowls are used for thai noodle soup. Which turned out to be wrong.  In the end they offered to compensate with a thai noodle soup, which is not bad. I would give them points for questioning the customer because customer is not king and you do not just do whatever the customer says. However, points are docked for getting their arguments wrong. But they still decided to offer compensation free of charge, which is acceptable.  The noodle soups were pretty watered down. Although the ingredients they use seem fresh, and the option to allow me to select soba noodles is interesting, I didn't particularly feel that I would want to get the noodle soups again.  The poke bowl was better than the soup. A good amount of fish, and the ingredients were enjoyable. The spicy salmon bowl came with a few pieces of kimchi. Compared to the ones at korean restaurants, I thought they were a bit too strong in flavor, but I don't know if that's good or bad. The onions they used were also very strong, the kind of sensation you get when you're chopping fresh onions.  Overall, I think if they only offered the poke bowls it would be a bit better. If I had only picked a noodle soup I may have been more disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the first item on the noddle menu and my friend had the second one. They tastes exactly the same. another instagrammable place but has mediocre food."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try H2 kitchen during the Yelp Elite event and knew I had to return for to try their salmon poke so I ordered the large spicy salmon poke ($15.77) on a weekday afternoon. The spicy salmon bowl includes spicy Atlantic salmon, kimchi, corn, edamame, crab meat salad (SO GOOD), carrot, beet, cucumber, chopped up cherry tomatoes, onions, and seaweed salad (ALSO SO GOOD). The server also asked me if I wanted a green or red apple which I love! The healthy concept is not only cute but I think it accomplishes what it aims to do and that is to promote delicious and healthy food. However, I am unsure what sauce they used for the bowl but it was delicious and more spicy than I was expecting.  With ample seating, bright lighting, self-serve water, and better than average service, H2 is worth it but may be a little bit too pricey. However, their prices are justified when you taste how fresh their bowls are. I had the mango smoothie before as well and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Tried out this place and I'll surely return! Many healthy items in their menu with a great taste. One of their best items is their poke and smoothies. Very nice and friendly decor! I can't wait to return to try out their other items!"}
{"text":"The poke craze in Toronto. This is a clean, fast food-esque venue with a health bent, with most of it being self served.  You order at the counter and pay, wait for your order to be ready and seat yourself on any one of the table/booth. The orders come with an apple and there's free lemon or orange water for you to drink,  Many of the items have the choice of sizes, they also have price for \"members\" which is cheaper. Although I personally don't know if I'd want to join membership of a restaurant, the concept seems odd, unless you plan to eat there all the time but I really prefer to eat as many varieties of food as possible.   Anyways, back to the Poke. I found the small sized Poke was really small. Not satisfying. I am the type of person who usually gets full. We also chose the potato or taro noodles instead of rice, which I found don't really go with the Poke. I think rice would have soaked up the flavour of the bowls better. In the case with the noodles, the seasoning just don't really stick to them. The spicy salmon poke was so so, the flavour didn't really come through for me. My companion got the octopus  Poke in a large size. It tasted a bit better I think."}
{"text":"Great bowls and smoothies! All the ingredients are as fresh as they come. Because it's still relatively new they paid close attention to keeping standards high so I hope this is maintained. I came here for dinner but I look forward to having lunch and people watching on Queen St one day soon."}
{"text":"Went to H2 Kitchen with some friends to try out their new healthy concept Poke. Most of us took two dishes (Poke and Noodle Bowl) with a smoothie. Unfortunately, I was sick that day and lost my appetite, so I only took one Hokkaido Dive Poke with a Raspberry & Strawberry Smoothie.  The Hokkaido Dive is limited to 20 per day and two of our friends came in late, thus they didn't get the chance to try it. The poke was pretty filling with lots of ingredients, including Uni, Ahi Tuna, Black Cavier, Corn, Edamame, Crab Meat, Carrot Spiral, Beet Spiral, Golden Beet Spiral, Cucumber, Cherry Tomato, Red Onion Slice, Seaweed Salad, and Baby Scallop. Unlike other poke places that use a strong mayo sauce, H2 uses a very light sauce to promote healthy eating. Because the sauce was too light and the rice was a bit dry, some of us needed to ask extra sauce on the side.  Overall, the meal was satisfying and the ingredients were really fresh. It would be nice for the company to expand their line of products with sushi burritos."}
{"text":"Needs a little bit of fixing, but pretty good overall.   I got here about 20 minutes before they opened, but the restaurant was unlocked, so I went in. They were nice enough to tell me the rice would be finished cooking in about 10 minutes and gave me the WiFi password. Off to a very good start here.  Had the Hokkaido dive, which is the one with the uni and albacore tuna. Also had the salmon x tako. There are a ton of toppings in each bowl, but I could have used more protein. There was uni on both bowls, which was a pleasant surprise, but only one piece per bowl. I suppose it makes sense, given the price of these bowls, but if we're going to call it the first uni poke bowl in Toronto, it could use more uni. Otherwise, I can get more uni in a bowl elsewhere. Same goes with the octopus in the salmon x tako bowl. I could have used more of it, given it's a part of the name of the bowl. I like protein in every bite, and this was a little bit missing. However, these bowls didn't lack in the fresh department.    I got the salmon x tako on white rice. Loads of white rice. Too much rice. However, I did get the Hokkaido dive on soba and that was an amazing choice. I want all my poke bowls on soba or on a salad base from now on!  Service was fantastic here. There are a are a bunch of different kinds of seating. There are electric outlets everywhere so you can charge things. You get an apple with your purchase. All in all, not a bad place to grab a healthier meal!"}
{"text":"I had a change to go with some friends during their soft opening period. The restaurant replaced Ebisu location on Queen West near Osgood station. The staff explained the concept of H2 Kitchen where they promote a healthy lifestyle for their patrons with food, nutrition education and exercise.  We were told that they receive their ingredients in the morning and prep promptly after. Luckily, we were able to try the Hokkaido Dive poke with uni since we arrived early. The ingredients were really fresh with tuna, uni, black caviar, scallop and regular poke goodness. You can also add scallops and half an avocado to your order. They only serve 20 per day. The price may be more expensive that other places but keep in mind the quality and the uni that you are getting.  We also ordered the Thai Style with Shrimp noodle bowl was not flavourful unfortunately except for a strong pepper taste. The shrimp was nicely cooked with the soba noodles but I did not like the taste of the soup. The last thing that I order was the Peach Pineapple & Turmeric yogurt smoothie cup. Overall, a good experience and not too busy during the soft opening that will serve up to 100 customers. When word gets out, it will likely get busy from people wanting to try the uni poke bowl."}
{"text":"Overall three stars because even though veggies on the side were fresh the tuna was soso and the sushi rice was lacking some flavour. Also, I went hoping to try the Hokkaido dive (the popular one with uni) as I had won an Instagram contest that stated i could try any bowl of my choice. Ended up I couldn't try two of the five bowls on the menu. I had a talk with the store manager afterwards and even after showing her my vouchers (no restrictions stated) and my Instagram account to prove I had won she questioned whether my vouchers were from winning that contest - so customer service was mediocre... If they are so strict about not including those in the contest or voucher, i felt that they should have communicated it better with food bloggers and also indicated on their vouchers."}
{"text":"Always willing to try new poke places, I gave this place a try. I was a little miffed that they do not show any of the prices on their website so after a 10 minute walk I was hoping to find prices reasonable. They seemed ok.  I picked large Spicy Salmon poke and price came to $15.77 including tax. The portion size was quite disappointing. There was very little fish. Their small portion must be tiny. Food was quite tasty and the fish was fresh and also quite good tasting. I just didn't feel very satisfied after eating it which I feel I should if I pay almost $16."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to come here during their soft opening to try some of their signature menu items. Lovely restaurant located on Queen Street West. Ample space and lighting. H2 has a nice display case of fresh vegetables and fruits in the back. I had the opportunity to talk to the chef while he was preparing my meals. I ordered their Hokkaido Dive which is one of their signature bowls here as they only make 20 per day!! I also ordered the dancing Bombay and the mango smoothie. Looking at their menu, the prices are a little bit more premium compared to other poke places. I had the opportunity to chat with the chef as he was making my poke bowls. He mentioned that the ingredients they used are local sourced. The difference of their poke bowls that distinguishes from other ones is that their bowls are healthier because they don't use preservatives and are more fresh fish used in their bowls. Watching the chef prepare my bowls and how he crafts the ingredients together is simply a work of art. I thoroughly enjoyed the Hokkaido Dive bowl. Lots of interesting flavours with the caviar and the nice blend of ingredients and sauces to make this bowl- it simply works. They definitely give you way more pieces of tuna which was generous and simply love the uni. Definitely a signature bowl worth getting here. The dancing bombay had nice flavours and the tandoori chicken mixed with the mango dressing had some unique flavours. Simply loved this bowl as well. I got their mango smoothie and it was quite good and not too sweet. Overall, a very positive lunch experience. Just on one poke bowl, I felt I was satisfied. Very filling meal and quite the healthy alternative. Will definitely come back for a visit to try their menu items!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from H2 but I was pleased to find that they had really good, aesthetically pleasing (most poke bowls are) poke bowls. I also find it really cute that they give you a free, complimentary apple to go with your meal! Everything was healthy of course. Prices were pretty reasonable. Definitely a place to go to for lunch!"}
{"text":"The interior here is so relaxing!  - white & baby blue oceanesque theme - instagrammable neon sign amongst green foliage - very spacious - outlets available for charging - 2 dumbbells greeting you at the entrance to pull in a last minute workout before eating?  1. Choose a base:  white rice / brown rice / soba  2. Pick a bowl:   a. Hokkaido Dive - ~$17.95 (uni, Ahi tuna, caviar, corn, edamame, crab meat, carrot spiral, beet spiral, golden beet spiral, cucumber, cherry tomato, red onion slice seaweed salad, baby scallop) Uni & caviar in poke? :OOoooOO  Had to try this as per the cashier's recommendation ( since there's only a limited amount available a day ). The vegetables are very fresh, the rice is fluffy, and the seafood is tasty! I was ESPECIALLY surprised that the uni was delicious, since there are so many ways at other places where it can go wrong. The caviar (possibly just roe + squid ink) didn't leave a lasting impression but it's still tasty like generic fish roe. This is also the first time I tried golden beet; has a nice grassy taste to it.   b. Spicy Salmon - ~$11.95 (spicy Atlantic salmon, kimchi, corn, edamame, crab meat, carrot spiral, beet spiral, golden beet spiral, cucumber, cherry tomato, red onion slice, seaweed salad) The brown rice was a little on the chewy side but overall was good. The crab meat is marinated in sesame oil. Yummy *o* Only thing is that even though the bowls are piled high with ingredients, the bowls in themselves are small, and would keep you full for a short amount of time in this cold Canadian weather. However I have yet to try their other non-poke options which seem more filling!  Sidenote: My friend and I were appreciative that the cherry tomatoes were cut in half and not served whole. Yush it makes a difference huehue.  3. Load up on extra furikake at the self serve station - they have cool stuff like dried laver flakes, wasabi sesame seeds etc. There are 10+ different toppings to sprinkle to your heart's content - complimentary water is good too  4. Comes with a red or green apple!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since it was new and close to where I live. The place was nicely decorated and looked very clean.   They offered a $5 membership which gives you a discounted price on all their items for 1 year. It's worth it if you plan to go often enough but their prices for poke bowl is not cheap. It's good that they have other food options as well. They also have a breakfast menu.   I ordered the spicy salmon bowl with half sushi rice and half veg base. They give a ton of toppings which I really enjoyed. The portions for base and protein was  good ratio. Flavour wise it was good but I wish you had the option to pick a sauces.   My boyfriend picked the tuna bowl, the flavours were very very bland in the tuna. It could have used some sort of sauce on top. But topping wise they were very generous and had a good variety of veggies.   Overall I would go again but to try their breakfast items. The poke wasn't anything special for the price they charge."}
{"text":"Went to H2 kitchen during their soft opening with friends!   Their grand opening is feb 22nd.     They took over the space that use to be Ebisu and converted to a very white, clean, neat space that seems quite spacious.    The staff was friendly and every order seems to come with a green apple which is a nice touch.   All of their ingredients are out in the open so you can see the fresh produce.   I'm an avocado lover and noticed their avocados are huge!!!  Getting half an avocado at $2 addition to the bowl is totally worth it (large avocados are so expensive... I know, I buy them regularly ).     Now down to the food:  Poke bowls - I tried the salmon poke bowl and the Hokkaido bowl (uni and tuna) and it is gorgeous and delicious...like a work of art especially with the edible flowers!   Unlike most poke bowls that uses fried foods to give it the crunchy texture, they use heathy spiralized  red and orange beets.  Unlike many that uses mayonnaise to flavour the fish, they give you ponzu sauce to add to your taste.   I quite enjoyed the portions, I had the brown rice base.     Noodle bowl - I tried the Thai style with shrimp and it's a noodle soup bowl.   It's a very light but flavourful green curry coconut milk broth base that's not greasy at all but full of flavour.   I opted for the sweet yam seaweed noodles ($1 extra) that has no carbs and carbs as happily satisfied, great healthy noodle soup without feeling carb heavy afterwards or feeling like I need to drink a gallon of water .  The soup base isn't thick, so if you prefer a light broth this is for you.     Smoothies - Very Berry is really good!   It's mixed berries with a hint of mint and the greek yogurt thickens it well.   I can get it in a bowl form which they make very pretty for photos but that's if you feel like eating your smoothies like soup.    I still prefer it in a cup with a straw.... so I got the cup version.  Lol   So I'm super happy they opened up and I'll likely get their $5 membership card that gives me 10 percent off menu items because they are walking distance from my house.   I do like healthy options and their prices are fairly decent, especially downtown, and especially since pretty much every restaurant raised their prices this January due to the increased minimum wage.     It's getting harder to find healthy lunches or a meal in general at the $10-12 price point .   I know, I went in expecting another poke joint (over a dozen popped up in the past year) and came out pleasantly surprised.  Definitely the prettiest poke bowls I've ever had and quality wise one of the best!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for poke bowls now!  I was downtown running errands and knew I had to visit H2 myself. My yelp elite friend shared some Thai curry soup + soba with me last month and I enjoyed this unique combination and taste a lot!   Since it was my first time here, Nick (owner) walked me step by step. For the poke bowls, you can choose sushi rice, brown rice or soba for the base. I ordered myself the spicy salmon bowl, with soba as the base. Ingredients were very fresh!! I just didn't like all the onions. Bowl was devoured instantly, and I was given a fruit to finish off my meal. I chose an orange over the apple, which was very sweet! I was comfortably full and had the much needed energy to finish up my errands.  There's also a VIP card for $5. If you frequent here a lot, I suggest getting it. It'll give you instant discounts to their poke bowls and hot bowls.  I would come here more, if only Nick opens a poke restaurant uptown... hint hint."}
{"text":"Found out about this new poke shop opening up near Osgoode station.  Being a big poke fan I had to try it out.  Unfortunately wasn't able to try their Hokkaido Bowl Dive bowl (limited to 20 bowls per day) so I got the Salmon x Tako bowl instead.  The bowl had lots of nice flavours and ingredients tasted fresh.  Most of the sauce ended up on the bottom and they recommend giving the whole bowl a good mix before consuming.  There was a good amount of salmon, but there wasn't much octopus.  Would have enjoyed the bowl more if I was able to pick which veggies and sauces I wanted.  They did have a station with many different seasonings you can add to your bowl.  In addition to the poke bowl, I also got their thai soup bowl with shrimp. The shrimp was cooked well and the soup tasted good but I would have preferred the soup base to be thicker.  Also was given small plastic spoons that didn't go well with the big soup bowl.  They do have an interesting option of adding yam noodles. Would be interested in trying out this place again.  A good place for poke bowl lovers or those that want a healthy option."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant in the neighbourhood. At first, I was like another poke bowl place in the area but that's ok. The inside is nice, plenty of seating. I got the spicy salmon poke in large, which is actually a very decent portion and a good chunk of sashimi. Food was very fresh. Also came with an Apple which is a nice bonus.  Poke bowls are typically on the high-end of fast food but you can't beat the ingredients."}
{"text":"Recommended: Hokkaido Dive (...and probably any poke bowl)  Good: Bhel on the run salad  OK: Pineapple & Peach smoothie (with turmeric)  What I like about H2 is the details. Sure, anyone could eat a bit or Tuna, or a piece of Uni. But there are probably 14-15 ingredients in each bowl, so it would take a long time to reproduce.  Variety is healthy. Indeed, everything about H2 seems geared towards health. For instance, next to the cash register, they display the delivery times for vegetables and fish each day. When I was there, it was 9:00am for vegetables, and 9:30 for fish.  The Hokkaido Dive bowl contains Tuna, Uni, mini scallops, shredded artificial crab, and a bunch of other vegetables. You can get it on a bed of rice, or alternative options, including yam noodles. The bowl is delicious and filling. I like how the bowl is designed as a wide cylindrical shape, allowing the ingredients to be spread properly over the rice. You can get a mouthful or rice in each bite.  The \"Bhel on the run\" salad is inspired by Chaat, the Indian street snack. Indeed, the top of the salad has the reminiscent crispiness of chaat, with similar flavours coming from the chutney and other sauces. I added a side of tandoori chicken. I liked this dish, but I think more sauce would take it from good to excellent.  Peach and Pineapple smoothie, ordered in a bowl, comes with some blueberries, banana, and oats. It's good, but the pineapple is a bit too strongly acidic. But not much can be done because that's pineapple.  Overall, the menu is a bit more expensive, but I think you're getting a larger variety of ingredients, and it seems like they care about quality. A worthy trade off.  Also, I was finishing up when the great song \"You only get what you give\" came pumping out of the speakers. Good timing.  Pro tip: bring your glasses, the menu is extremely detailed, but the words are tiny."}
{"text":"Eating healthy is always what I want to do but I find there's not much options available.  Recently I was introduced to H2 Kitchen and was impressed with the variety of food they serve.  To start off, the restaurant uses local and fresh ingredients daily.  The staff updates the vegetable delivery time and fish preparation time on the board so customers can see.  Every meal comes with a fresh apple and I ordered the most popular shrimp noodle bowl with yam noodles (no carbs) and the uni tuna poke bowl.  The noodle was fresh and not oily at all with lots of greens.  The poke bowl had a lot of flavours and was so colourful that it won't disappoint.  Almost too beautiful to eat.  As healthy food equals happy mood, I will be back for more soon.  Perfect place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Decent healthy food at reasonable price but there was no one in there and the staff were still slow as molasses."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a nice display case of fresh fruits in the back.  They stand for health and sell a number of signature poke bowls, with the exclusive uni bowl limited to only 20 per day - once they are out, they are out.  They are moderately busy during their soft launch and it would be interesting to see how people will flock to this restaurant once it is in full swing.  The signature poke bowls look beautiful, and they take a lot of care and pride in the presentation of the food.  Everything is colourful and one of those places where you eat with your eyes. *Ahem* do it for the 'gram.  I felt the bowls were a tad heavy on the rice with two full scoops of either sushi rice or brown rice.  I had a tasting of both.  The sushi rice is softer, stickier and a little clumpy.  The brown rice has more of a texture, but a bit drier.  I would say both are equally good.  I also got their mango smoothie bowl.  This fell a bit short for me as I think a smoothie bowl should warrant a bowl, and not just placed in a bowl for presentation purposes.  A smoothie bowl should be thicker than a regular smoothie - and I felt this wasn't the case.  I could have stuck a straw in it and slurped it up.  It's also worthwhile to say that the mango in the mango smoothie bowl is the tart type, and not the sweet Asian type that you normally get at bubble tea places.  This is important to note because poke has an Asian flare, so I was expecting the sweet mango type."}
{"text":"H2 Kitchen provides a relaxing environment for all their customers to socialize and to enjoy their meal. Their menu offers customers with a variety of healthy options, from poke bowls to grain bowls and the ingredients used are very fresh.  I ordered the Dancing Bombay salad bowl and I can tell you that I wouldn't mind eating this everyday. It was tasty and most importantly full of healthy ingredients.   For anyone that wants to eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle, I would recommend giving H2 Kitchen a try."}
{"text":"High end Poke bowl place.  It is on the pricier side but as they say, you get what they pay for.  Quality and fresh ingredients.   Uni (sea urchin) Tuna Bowl.  This place's signature item.  Uni was fresh and good.  Where else are you going to get Uni as a part of your poke bowl?  A piece of uni sushi alone can cost $5-6.  But uni is not everybodys thing so I can imagine that if people don't want uni that they may avoid ordering this premium bowl.  Rice was a bit too much (its a large bowl).  There was not enough tuna to say that it was the star of the dish but it tasted good.  Addition of fish roe and edible flowers adds to the the beauty of the dish.  Salmon Tako (octopus) Bowl.  Large amount of side items just like the Tuna bowl.  Not enough Salmon/Tako again to say its the star of the dish but it was very good.  For both bowls add some taro chips to give the bowl some texture, makes it even better.  Mango Smoothie Bowl.  I was disappointed with this item.  At $9 I would be expecting real mangoes to be used but it was just a mango juice/puree and yogurt blend in a bowl.  Bananas and blue berries on top.  Not very exciting.  I would skip this item.  Service was friendly and the chef seems really proud of what he/she is serving which is awesome.  I can see wait times be potentially very long during full launch because he had to open and close many containers because the dishes does have many many different ingredients that come together.  I hope they can streamline this a bit for people who want food on the go fast.  Setting was nice and relaxing.  Electrical plugs easily accessible and eye level when sitting for those addicted to their phones.  Have a conversation people!  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh, healthy, and well put together. The poke bowls are may be smaller than other places but the ingredients have more variety and better quality. I've also tried the noodle bowls, which reminds me of the meals I make at home. H2 Kitchen serves food with a balance of health and taste which I respect."}
{"text":"Appreciate the whole \"healthy concept\" and you can tell that this place is trying really hard with the instagramable decor and picture-pretty food. I found my experience subpar.  Food quality - They give way too much rice for their poke bowl. Salmon pieces were extra fatty that you can tell it's not prime meat because my stomach felt funny after eating. Above all, i found a strand of hair deeply embedded within my huge chunk of rice (picture provided).  Service - Extremely slow service on top of rude staff who felt like taking her sweet time with orders. The way the ordering system is set up is inefficient. There were times when staff completely ommited putcertain ingredients in the bowl  I take back my initial bad review. The store reached out and offered me a chance for them to make up for the hair in food. They really value customer service."}
{"text":"The space is nice and wide so that's a good first impression. That being said, I had a lot of Poke in the city, and this one does not impress.  Had the spicy salmon one, which is the best seller. It's mainly cheap uncooked/not-seasoned ingredients, such as corn, cucumber, carrots, beets, jalapeno... so the value isn't amazing. Seaweed salad was ok. Rice was very sticky and overcooked. And now the salmon. They have big chunks which I like, and it's marinated as it should be in a poke, but it's not that tasty. And there's not much of it in the bowl.  Also the service was slow.  So as far as poke goes, near miss for me. Not coming back."}
{"text":"H2 Kitchen is the latest restaurant to offer healthy foods in the downtown core. Their menu consists of poke bowls, salad bowls, hot noodle bowls, breakfast toast, and smoothie bowls.  I didn't eat the uni at their launch, but I did get the bowl during the soft opening period. Out of all the poke bowls that I've tried, my favorite was the Hokkaido Dive (limited to 20 bowls per day) with the Spicy Salmon being a very close second. Hokkaido Dive is their signature poke bowl, and topped with uni (a nice touch that separates them from other places). Not only was it tasty, but it also beautifully decorated with edible flowers and lots of color. Yes, prices are a little higher, but the ingredients are locally sourced, fresh ingredients are displayed at the front, and portion size are generous. Basically you get what you pay for. The flavors worked really well together, and I liked that the sauce wasn't overpowering and light.   The interior elements strive to convey the message of simplicity, modern and clean ... perfect for Instagram shots. There are also plenty of outlets if you want to do some work or study during lunch. Overall, H2 Kitchen is definitely a welcoming addition to the neighborhood.  P.S: You also get an apple with a purchase."}
{"text":"4 stars for food. 3 stars for service.   Food: fantastic options for poke bowls. Having soba noodles as a base instead of ice is an interesting option! They are made with fresh ingredients. I got the spicy salmon and it was good but nothing super flavourful.   Service: I waited 20 minutes before being able to order (no exaggeration). There as only one person working the cash and making the bowls. Highly inefficient and the manager should really reconsider this setup to maintain a reasonable flow for customers."}
{"text":"I really liked the interior design of this place the moment I stepped in. It's bright, airy and clean. They offer a membership option for $5 I believe to get discounts off their food.  I've only come here for poke bowls as it's the closest place to me and the flavours are nice. I don't like too much sauce in my poke so this was perfect. They also offer a lot of colour and textures in their bowls which I really appreciate. Pricing is average for poke bowls downtown. There's a complementary apple that comes with your food, going with the whole healthy theme of this establishment. There's also free water for you to help yourself to that's infused with citrus fruits which is a nice touch. Overall I really enjoy this place and have come back multiple times, even bringing my friends here. I think they have some stuff on their menu that I haven't found elsewhere and the price is still decent. I've also ordered with the Feedback app to pick up from 3-5 pm so it was discounted too."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. Got their spicy salmon bowl and ingredients tasted pretty fresh. I liked how they don't use spicy mayo and just sriracha(maybe?) as it feels healthier but it was a little too spicy for me. Overall I enjoyed my bowl but found the kimchi tasted kinda weird with everything else."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to try out their poke bowl for lunch. I have to say, this is the healthiest and most valuable poke I have tried. The ingredients were very fresh and prepped well. Each bowl was presented beautifully and tasted delicious with their house sauce."}
