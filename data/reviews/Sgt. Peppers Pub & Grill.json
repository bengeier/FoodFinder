{"text":"I was visiting my family in ajax and we went to this restaurant for dinner. ..disgusting.  Please beware of this place.   I had a bone in my food that I almost choked on.  I complained to the manager who did nothing about it except take it to the kitchen.   I paid my bill and they didn't even take it off.  I called and spoke with the owner Coomy and he said he would speak to his manager and call me back.   Well he never did.   I called back and he said he forgot.   I asked for a refund and he said he couldn't do anything about it.  The food is disgusting and the customer service is even more disgusting."}

No trace of any heat.  The waitress rarely visited our table too check on our drinks our food.  Suffice to say, this was my first and last time at this chain."}
