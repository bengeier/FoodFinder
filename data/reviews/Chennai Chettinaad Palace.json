{"text":"I am giving one star because i am really disappointed with their service..very spicy food even after asking for no spice in any of the items but all items had high spice not even mild...In kids meal i have asked for cheese uttapam but they have packed cheese dosai and instead of cheese it was too oily for any kid...so for next time i will not go to this place."}
{"text":"Ever pathetic service I ever had for Indian food. All the food was tasteless.we order 6 dishes and all good tasteless and very less in quantity even for a single person. Seems like every person should order at least 2 dishes to eat. I highly recommend not to go to this restaurant ever.  I would have given zero rating but there was no option for that in yelp."}
{"text":"Hello I just went there for Fathers Day lunch and has a good experience I thought until we were checking out. My father paid half gift card and half cash. The worker informed him that if he paid all cash he would receive a discount(keep in mind who runs a business like that) then my father said no. They also almost charged for my 2 year old nephew for no reason. After paying the bill we called the gift card company and they said Chennai charged another $10 on top of the bill. Do not trust these crooks. They lied to us in person."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I asked for beer and idli.  Beer never came( even after multiple requests) and idli went to some other table and i was suggested to adjust with some one else's order as they had too many guests :/ when i complained to the manager i got a straight face sorry..this is definetly not the place where i will go again."}
{"text":"Horrible food. This food is nowhere close to the North Indian food you get in India. The severs were snobbish and rude. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Have to wait 45 minutes for someone to just get the menu and get just water on the table. All waitresses seem to be running around frantically but they don't seem to have any output due to lack of coordination and mismanagement. Food quality has also gone down over last 6 months. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday with very low expectations but was wowed by the ambience and good food. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Chicken tikka masala was extra good.  However, service was not that great. Not bad, but it could be better. A little slow."}
{"text":"This place has decent decor for a valley Indian restaurant and very average food. The dosas at Ananda Bhavan or even Karaikudi are way better! The service is quite inadequate and even rude at times. Quite frustrating."}
{"text":"We used to be regular customers of this place. The service has been lousy lately and we some attitude. After today's experience, we are not coming here anymore. They made us sit for 25-30 min and said it would be a bit late. There was another table with 15-20 persons. After all we were two persons and ordered just a soup, a dosa and Pongal. Can't you at least get the soup? We were then told that would be a 45min wait. There was certainly an attitude. This never happens in a non-Indian restaurant (just because there is a party of 20, a party of 2 should wait for ever). This is sucks."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, everything worth the price. Lunch buffet is excellent and by far the best in north valley."}
{"text":"Dined here last night. The food was very good indeed (lamb kurma, chicken saag, and a few other dishes), well presented and quite flavorful without being overwhelming....five stars! The servers were not up to that standard, sadly...they were certainly inexpert and seemed inexperienced. I'll be back though. The annoyance of bumbling service was far outweighed by the quality of the delicious food."}
{"text":"I give up on Phx indian restaurant hunting.    Will try again another day.  Thankful for the wonderful meal, but this is not as good as they can get.  I taste a hint of spend thrift on this buffet.   No pickle. No masala dosa. No spicy food."}
{"text":"First about me: I am from chennai, Chettinaad is my favorite cuisine. I cook myself.  My buffet experience: Felt like unwanted guest to be inside eating their food after paying 13.99+tax.  Ratings(1-5) Buffet quality : -2(yes thats minus two) Taste: -3 (Not worth paying more than $5) Number of chettinad dishes: 0  I had to beg for drinking water. They have Dosa in their buffet which no one told even after 35 mins after we started eating, I had to take the shame and ask about that to them and they did bring after that. Which didn't taste great either.  I have been once for dinner there and it was good. So my review is only for buffet.   Will i go again there: Never... Not even if my best friend says they have improved their quality.  My request to the restaurant:  1.Please please please change your restaurants name. 2. Do you guys know chettinad is famous for sea-food? How much seafood do you guys serve in your buffet or you have in your menu. 3. Dont cheat by charging more. Charge based on your capacity and quality."}
{"text":"Food is good. But hate sometimes when they say no more service at lunch times. Timings should be extended especially on week ends!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and a friend. None of us knew that much about Indian food or what to order so we asked our waitress to order us 1 chicken item, 1 lamb, 1 vegetarian, and 1 appetiser. We had no idea what to expect but every single item they brought was amazing! Incredibly authentic, friendly staff, and they even were playing Bollywood movies! Overall wonderful food and experience! Highly recommend the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala."}
{"text":"I tried gobi Manchurian it was crispy n very tasty!!! Pepper chicken n chicken biryani were good too.."}
{"text":"Worse Indian food in Phoenix. Waste of money. Food and service are horrible. Went for the lunch buffet with my family, food was cold and never topped up. Answer I got from the manager is that they can't provide hot food, it is what it is. I spent my money for the trash food, would not recommend anyone to waste money here."}
{"text":"This is authentic south Indian food. The best I have had in the valley so far.  Please dont let your chef go anywhere:)"}
{"text":"I have been there a few times, buffet is good, comes around $14 per head and worth it. Good options for non veg Indian food."}
{"text":"Went to Sunday lunch buffet. Buffet opened at noon. 13 USD per person. The chicken tikka masala and paneer butter masala were flavorful. The potato was nice too. The naan was perfectly textured. Their atmosphere is classy. Service is pleasant. The water does not taste like tap water and is actually tastes like soft mineral water (not iced). I think my boo and I were the only non-Indian/Pakistani there lol. Clean. Fresh. 13 USD for weekend lunch buffet. I would def go again. I think I found myself a new fav place."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is superb. Great selection, great flavors and full of Indian people eating there, which speaks volumes."}
{"text":"I was visiting phoenix and I visited this place and found best indian food in North America!!!! exceptional contempory decor, fentastic service,  I would recomend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. Checked In here this Sunday for Lunch Buffet.. I loved it. This is the best South Indian Restaurant in AZ. People will not finish their lunch until closing time. So check in early to reserve your table and enjoy Tasty food :-)  Keep it up Guys!"}
{"text":"Tasty, spicy food. We love this place for its Indo- Chinese and South Indian dishes. Rest of the stuff is very inconsistent but is good most of the times. The service was extremely bad when it comes to the waiters, it has improved a bit now.. but I would at least expect my server to say a 'Hi' .. which youll never get here. Most of the servers are rude and they will find a way to mess up your order each time. Food arrives very slowly on busy days.  1 * LESS FOR THESE THINGS N I REALLY FEEL THE MANAGEMENT SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT EM."}
{"text":"By and far the most authentic and tasty Indian food I have tasted so far in the US. I had come all the way from Albuquerque to try their food and every dish we ordered was very well prepared that I felt that I was back in India. Even though there are some delays in service at peak hours, it is obvious largely owing to their awesome food. I will come back again to Phoenix just to try the food here. Hats off to the team there!!"}
{"text":"Authentic... May be if you don't know what authentic South Indian food taste like. Worst service. I went there with my family to celebrate my wife's birthday. Girls working there spoiled our dinner. Rude, inconsiderate and don't know how to talk to customers. I felt like they were doing me a favor by taking my money.  There was one Indian girl working there who made my stay bearable. Sorry don't know her name. She should be the manager and teach other staff how to talk."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant 3-4 times for buffet, luckily all times food was too good. Specially spicy chicken tandoori and dry black paper chicken. Just make sure you go there before 2 PM for lunch buffet else most of the item would have already finished..."}
{"text":"I like this place. Their cooking is good and tasty. It's a nice place to go but staff needs more organized.. waiters are all confused and not accurate table wise. Good wait is minus plus"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch . Saw some friends who were already there and sat at same table .  Coming to the food , the chicken biriyani and Tandoori chicken were good . Rest of the food was average or poor .Had to wait a considerable time at the buffet stations for the food to be refilled , especially the Naan, biriyani and the appetizers.  In other Indian buffets I have been to , a Naan basket or dosa is served at the table . There was no such courtesy here . Overall the service was poor .  When the final bill came , there was an 18 % gratuity added.  I have not seen this kind of mandatory gratuity added for other buffets I have been to . I am all for tipping for good service , but not for non existent service during a buffet  !!! I inquired with the restaurant manager about the 18% gratuity and she said that this is how it is done in the restaurant and that I could call the restaurant owner !  Not a good experience overall .."}
{"text":"It is a little noisy at times but when you cook so good, you are bound to attract the people in. Great appetizers, chicken pepper dry and all the chaat stuff is mouth watering... and one of the most authentic Indian food you could ever find.  Just remember if you are not used to Indian spice,request for mild spice levels, and just sit back and enjoy the great food!"}
{"text":"I  have been there twice once for dinner and other time for buffet. We did like the alle karte, dal makhni was really good, so were our tandoori rotis. Kadai paneer was well made with paneer quality being very nice (unlike the rubbery types we get at many other places)   About buffet For vegetarians: very less options, almost half of the menu consists of non veg items. Also the veg items are just ok, one appetizer like vada and 2 curries like chole and paneer which are just average in preparation so if you are vegetarian n going for a buffet , go with least expectation .   As for staff they all are ok and ambience is casual"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet on the Saturday was simply superb. I went with low expectations because I am from NoVA, DC metro where there are tons of Indian restaurants but Chennai Chettinad really surprised me. Food was pretty authentic and had tons of Veg options. Dosa was missing in the buffet but 4 desserts was a surprise. Fish curry, palak-paneer, goat curry & chicken biryaani were the best. Everything was tasty and would definitely come back here if I visit Phoenix! Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, spotless establishment, incredible buffet.  This is southern Indian food and is on the spicy side.  Those with bland palates have thousands of restaurants serving boring food from which to pick and should go one of them.  This place is for me.  My experience is limited to lunch buffet and not dinner service. I have been twice and have sampled most things on the buffet and have found everything to be absolutely delicious and fresh.  Yes, plastic plates and cold nan bread but really, dudes, it's a buffet.  While the service was not mind-blowing, it was adequate and friendly.  Reference above comment about buffets.  The place is clean as a whistle.  The decor is a bit boring, but the booths are deep and private.  The good food and interesting conversations with a friend takes care of the decor problem. The Bollywood videos playing above the bar are amusing and add ambiance.  If I knew what they were saying perhaps they'd be annoying.  On both visits the place was very busy and every other patron appeared to be ethnic indian.  In this case racial profiling works for me as an endorsement.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Pathetic experience. 1. Was charged 18% gratuity in advance for buffet. When asked for explanation, the employee told us to talk to owner. Would have been happier giving money as voluntary tip. 2. Insufficient food. Had to ask multiple times to get food. 3. Was denied bread/dosa on table. 4. Horrible restroom. Even the hand wash liquid soap was empty. 5. Vegetarian curries were pathetic."}
{"text":"Horrible service - I went there for a pickup after a very poor experience with the buffet. I was hoping the evenings would be better - but to my dismay they made me wait for a very long time after I reached there... I had ordered on the phone before hand and reached there after the alloyed time ... After being made to wait I again went and enquired and I think then they started on my order- again a wait at the counter for 15 mins with me checking with every of the several there on the status.. And after all these once they give the order they dont even care to apologize  Food was ok but I think it was the built up of the hunger which made it taste better Very unhappy with the service!! By the way just to add there was hardly any rush which would explain the delay"}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price. Have visited over 10 times now, pretty consistent. Can be way better, but the staff isnt just enough. They are trying to do their job, but they cant cater to so many people. They need more hands and better service"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad.  I've never dined in, only ordered take-out.  The staff is nice, and the interior is pretty attractive with beautiful flooring and a soothing atmosphere (minus the tv).  Their garlic naan is usually excellent, but the other dishes I've tried (baingan bartha and chole palak) are generally a bit too salty for my tastes.  I've eaten here a handful of times, and the saltiness is consistent.  I might stop here again sometime, but I'll be checking out the other nearby Indian options first."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! We got the Chettinad curry and the chicken biriyani. Both were pretty spicy but tolerable and very flavorful. Unfortunately, the service was a little low on customer service. Not much smiling. No thank you for coming. Just a little blah. And we were one of 4 couples in the entire place! Weird location too. The decor is really nice but then the waiting staff is in blue jeans; so it's a little confusing. With professional staff and a better location, this place could do really well!"}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give a lower rating. Food was actually ok but it took over 2 hrs for our food to come.they would get food for one person at a time and the others would just watch ...the wait staff blamed it all on the cooks! There was not even an apology offered by anyone. Unfortunately, this is a typical unprofessionally run Indian restaurant. Not going back there, ever. Should have listened to my wife who had the same experience when she went with her mother, so definitely not an isolated incident."}
{"text":"This place is ok ok, the food is 4/5 but the service is pathetic. I have been here 4 times and everytime the service is equally bad  If the owner is listening via yelp, please you have a good thing going on but the service is ruining your restaurant.  Please please improve on the service factor."}
{"text":"They really have good south Indian dishes especially Kotthu paratto, spciy chicken garvy. But I would rate the buffet as average in terms if taste and variety. And I love their Biryani. Staffs are really nice."}
{"text":"I am a south indian......schezwan veg fried rice was excellent with paneer butter masala.... Dosas were big but too costly plain dosa is 8.99$ ... Service is  too slow  we have to call them constantly for spoons ,plates and water...but definetly worth the wait for the taste.. Sure will visit again ..."}
{"text":"They stopped the complimentary dosa (buffet) and the food was tasting weird. Especially vegan curries.  Some of the chicken curries were good I heard."}
{"text":"Excellent reataurant if u want to have authentic south indian food. Been here quiet many times now and every time the food was delicious. There buffet are fantastic and have lots of variety in Veg and non veg both. I love there mutton biryani and chicken curry.chciken tndooribis also nice. Mango lassi is good as always i wish they offered it qith buffet though. Service is quick and satisfactory. My in laws visited us and took them here for buffet they loved it too. I would recommed if anyone wants to have nice indian food."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars then I would! The food is horribly nasty and the service is extremely bad! The drinking water on the tables has been poured, who knows when, but all the glasses were already filled when we walked in. The water was room temperature and had the taste and smell of really bad stilled water. The restaurant looked deserted. The waitress didn't write down our orders, even though there was a note pad in her pocket. She kept on asking again and again and again the few dishes that we have ordered. I asked for black pepper, she walked in/out of the kitchen 3and1/2 rounds before she remembered and told me that she had forgotten. By that time my soup was cold; I only tasted it and it was so salty that my throat felt raw. They forgot one of the dish that we had ordered. We reminded them. They brought it out when we were packing up our food that we had gotten the containers ourselves. I took the food home, recooked and fed it to our dogs and the neighbor's dogs. I felt really bad feeding the dogs this food but I couldn't throw food away. Save yourself and your $, and your dogs too, please don't eat here."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a Wednesday night.  We didn't encounter any of the issues the other reviewers had. Service was fine. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and prompt. There were only a few other diners present (many Indian, so that's a good sign!) Decor is OK. Felt a little 80's to me, but the restaurant is spacious and the backs of the booths are high enough that you can't see over them (a plus.) Bollywood music videos show on a couple of TVs.  Food was a couple dollars more than we're used to spending, but I had the chicken tikka (dry) off the appetizer menu - which was entree sized and my friend had a cauliflower curry (gobi). The vegetable samosas were good and they offered us a variety of chutneys, which were more like sauces than a traditional \"chunky\" chutney - tomato, mint and coconut (all good). Garlic naan was good, too.  Biggest complaint is the use of plastic dishes. And why there are Chinese food options on the menu is beyond me. Stick to one cuisine.  We both agreed the food we had was good and we'd consider returning here."}
{"text":"I'm happy, the food is amazing! I'm a big fan of dosas.   Pro: Food! dosa are awesome.  Con: Service could be better, but what restaurant really has waiters that care about their job. They didn't refill my drink quickly enough. big whop.   Conclusion: For the food and price I'm happy."}
{"text":"Food was excellent...I had a chicken Kurma and my friend had the Lamb Vindaloo.  My dish was good, but the lamb dish was better...i tasted my friend's dish and the lamb was super tender and well seasoned...just like I like it.  It was quite spicy though.  The Chicken I had mild, but had a little bite. The wait staff is nice but mixed alcoholic beverages were okay.  My mojito was just ok. One thing I didn't like is that the water was pre-poured on the table.  We asked a server to pour us fresh water and it took him a while to understand what we wanted."}
{"text":"I'm leaving no stars. The food is average at best. The major issue with this restaurant is the service. As an Indian restaurant I walked in expecting below average service. The service I received was horrendous. We were a party of 5 and the meals came out one at a time about 5-10 minutes apart. I ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. I got the chicken and rice with no naan. When naan finally arrived the chicken was cold. Oh and there were only 7 small cubes of chicken in a large gravy boat.   Update: management contacted me about the service issues and has given me a satisfactory response. I'm sure they will work to take care of the issues from happening again."}
{"text":"This place has improved since my first review. The dosas are real good and food tastes better."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but nasty workers and sloooooow service. Surprisingly when you enter this restaurant it's actually a simple,modern decor.  I say that because from the outside it looks like a run of the mill shabby Indian restaurant. It is often dusty inside though. Go here if you're having a desperate craving for South Indian food. Because be prepared to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes for food. Be prepared that they react poorly to any special requests such as please less spicy for my kid or no tomatoes. 3 out of 5 times they get my order wrong. Also, I happened to see the kitchen staff heading in to work and as my husband summed it up...they look like people who might have been living in the slums that were brought over to be paid poorly. Their clothes were LITERALLY COVERED in old and new food stains, one had long hair that wasn't pinned back...a complete turnoff. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't wear gloves back there."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Indian cuisine. Try their buffet to savour variety of dishes. They have a changing menu which is good. Nice ambience.  The only cons is the gulab jamun for dessert. It has tasted bad/ spoilt/like old stock on all occasions"}
{"text":"Best southern Indian food in Phoenix!  Chicken Tikka Masala Bomb, garlic naan is awesome and the Samosas!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Buffet in town!  The restaurant was extremely clean.  Service has been hit or miss, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Stunningly good and authentic Indian food. Just the right spices, well prepared and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We got a carry out from here a veg curry and a chicken dish. First of all they take an hour to prepare the food. That is ridiculous. Everywhere else it's 15 mins tops. Then the food was disgusting at best. Filled with tasteless oil and the chicken chewed like rubber. There is no way il ever go to this rubbish place. And the service was even more pathetic."}
{"text":"Went for a buffet during lunch time. The food was good, the servers were really busy but was able to check in. It was a great deal for the buffet. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a South Indian cuisine (although they have North Indian dishes as well)."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner. The food was ok, nothing spectacular. The food was neither fresh not authentic. There are places serving much better Indian food in the city."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best Indian lunch buffet in the valley.  Their food is fresh, flavorful, and actually spicy.  I large selection of both vegetarian dishes and non-vegetarian servings.  There is something to be said for the place being packed with Indians verses obese Americans!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say, I love the food but as everyone says the service is terrible.  Part of the reason is that the owners steal all of the tips from the waitresses. They make minimum wage, and all the tips go to the owners.   I am torn. It is without question my favorite food, but the owners steal from the servers. So I don't think I should eat here.... Really disappointing...  What does one do in this case?....   The other Indian restaurants around here are terrible. So I can drive to Tempe to support better practices for servers, or I can eat here and support thieves with delicious food."}
{"text":"I ordered different veggie food, but the malai cofta was too salted. I liked chili paneer and garlic naan. But kadai paneer was not that spicy and they used too much black pepper as well to make spicy. Kulcha was burnt as well. It was to go, so i didn't know the food was this much bad."}
{"text":"Amazing food perfect blend of spices , i tried the lunch buffet and its definetly one of the best in town (best till now) , great service and amazing variety of dishes for a lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Exceptional South Indian food. We have been here twice and have tried a variety of dishes. Egg Kothu Paratha was heavenly. The ghee roast dosa was a delight too. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I took my spouse out for Indian food this evening.  Rather than our usual we wanted to try a new location and Chennai Chettinaad did not disappoint.  We tried a variety meat and vegetarian dishes.  The chicken tikka masala was flavorful and mildly spicy.  My go to \"heat\" dish, lamb vindaloo, was flavorful with tender chunks of lamb. While I had ordered the maximum spice level what I received was a medium.  We also ordered a vegetarian dosa which was done with the same level of care as the other dishes.  The last dish ordered was biryani. The biryani was a solid good.  I look forward to seeing what it is like with added \"heat\".  The service at the restaurant was good to very good.  All in all a very charming restaurant whose attention to detail showed in everything from the excellence of the dishes to the decor."}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes and they weren't ready. It's so expensive but their food is cold and less spices. (Definitely doesn't taste like Indian Cuisines )If you want to the taste Indian food definitely check other places. They didn't ask us for any beverage but left us with room temperature water. (Girl, seriously?! Not even any ice?!) On top of that, their water glass is nasty. I'm sorry but wouldn't recommend everything or anything from this place."}
{"text":"OK, The reviews were rather depressing and we decided on Indian buffet for lunch. We decided on Chennai Chettinaad Palace and was not disappointed in the least. Atmosphere was charming, unlike it predecessor Tokyo Express. Service was wonderful and the food very flavorful and exciting. My only agreement with other reviewers is that most of the dishes, of which there is a great selection, would be that it is just a touch beyond \"comfortable spicy\". When we left, our table was the only empty table there. It was packed with folks waiting both inside and out. We were the only non-indian patrons. I would love to review all the different foods, like chili fish and chicken, goat and more. Please accept my apology as I hardly know what they were or their ingredients. But the food is wonderful. Try it. Its worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian lunch buffet! If quality of food is important to you , you will love this place.  Even, for a change, I liked the dessert options."}
{"text":"Hands down, this place has the best Indian buffet in Glendale. I have been here 3 times now and have had a great experience on each visit. The flavors are rich and full and have a good amount of spice (hotness). Aside from the wonderful food, the wait staff are friendly and prompt. They also on a occasion serve free mango/mint juice that is delicious. I highly recommend this place for Indian food lovers or those who are wanting to try Indian food for the first time."}
{"text":"Food 5* - the food served here is the best in the valley, atleast comes close to what is prepared back home. The naan, butter chicken, goat biryani, veg manchurian dry, dosa, chicken curry is what i wud suggest that u order here as they do a very good job with it.  Moving onto service 1*- it sucks- well, u've got 2 ask for menu's more then once, they forget to get straws or cutlery to ur table most often, there is a tall Indian guy who is the server, whom u wished, u did not meet. Ambience 4*, it's not the greatest or best compared to other restaurants but compared to most Indian restaurants- it's good. .. Cleanliness 4* again, it's very good n the restrooms are clean 2. So if u don't mind compromising on service but would like to enjoy a good Indian meal or miss food served back home- you should try this place"}
{"text":"I guess it was a good thing that it was rather cold and rainy when I came here for a little buffet lunch UYE with Rand H, Mike C and Arlin B.  I enjoyed the food but be aware that heat level of the most of the food was medium to medium hot - which I like, but might be a bit daunting for some people. I particularly enjoyed the chicken curry, the egg masala and the lentil dish, and found the other dishes to be quite good. The server was very attentive, and the crispy dosas she brought to our table was a nice addition to our meal. At about 10 bucks, the price of the lunch buffet is about the same as most other Indian buffets in the city, but the spacious, sparkly clean setting brings this place a tad above the rest for me."}
{"text":"they are famous for their buffets.. which are kind of pricy over the weekends.  when we order a la cartes - they dont serve the appetizers, entrees n dessert in an orderly fashion. however the people working there are friendly and serve with a smiling face."}
{"text":"Buffet is ok.. But somehow the food taste isnt consistent all the time.. An excellent appetizer will be a good addition to the buffet menu, just a suggestion"}
{"text":"I'm gonna say what we're all thinking - anybody who goes to an Indian restaurant expecting good service is an idiot. Docking an Indian restaurant for having poor service is like giving an India Pale Ale poor reviews because it doesn't have a very strong malt profile.  With that said, Chennai Chettinaad is the second best Indian buffet I have found in Phoenix. The food is flavorful and spicy, they have plenty of options both for the omnivores and vegetarians, and they have those nice crispy things whose name I'm sure my Indian colleagues told me but I forgot. Also, their gulab jaman is fantastic. I love finishing off a meal with a pair of warm, moist balls.  Notice it's the pampered white people giving them poor reviews, and slagging them off for their poor service?  I'm here to tell you that this place has all the aromatic dishes and the poor service you should expect from a good Indian buffet."}
{"text":"Chennai Chettinaad Palace is my new favorite Indian restaurant. The lunch buffet is changed up every day. They always have so many delicious dishes to choose from. Be sure to have the dosa.  The food here is just like the food I had when I was in south India. Great place to try things you have never tried before."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for Indian cuisine. The staff are so courteous... Very accommodating... The food... AMAZING. Best fish curry in Phoenix.... Easily."}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the service is becoming terrible. I used to go to this place very often because of their food. However, have started trying other Indian restaurants around as their service has come down so bad. Once it was crowded and as and when we entered the restaurant, the waitress was so rude and said beforehand that it'll take some time to come to you for the order. Going to this place once in a while is worth, but otherwise it's really waste of time. If the management is following the reviews, I'd advise them to let their folks know that being polite and good customer service is equally important as quality of food."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying their lunch buffet earlier this month, and our experience was completely different than our first evening dinner. What a shame.  Honestly, I think the worst aspect of the buffet was what can only be described as a lack of proper waitress training. We were greeted at the door, allowed to sit anywhere, but then our waitress disappeared. (Actually she just floated back-and-forth between other tables while ignoring us completely.) One waitress filled our water 20 minutes into lunch, and the other -- who presumably was our real waitress because she seated us --  didn't really do anything.  All the waitresses were more preoccupied with clearing and resetting tables than checking drink orders or refilling water glasses, despite many open tables unfilled for lunch. Other patrons were equally confused. The waitresses looked lost, like they didn't know what to do, or who was responsible for what. Near the end of our meal, I flagged our waitress over as she had a pitcher of water in her hand and we wanted more to drink. But when she approached, and we asked for water, she said \"ok\" and then TURNED AROUND AND LEFT! My girlfriend and I just looked at each other in disbelief. She returned to the waitress station, set down the pitcher of water, quickly mentioned something to the second waitress, then went to clear a table WHICH WAS NOT OCCUPIED. Another minute or so and she brings over a pitcher of ice water, but it had no ice except for half a dozen cubes near their death.  The buffet was expensive -- $13.99 -- and service was confusing at best or absent at worst. Some of the buffet items lacked being refreshed in a timely manner, too. This place is great for dinner, but in my opinion it's best to pass over the lunch buffet unless the manager and head chef can whip their staff into shape, and quickly.  P.S. - If they need help on how waitstaff should function, I'm open to offering my consulting services. Even the best food in the world will not keep people coming back if the service putting it out sucks ass."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time and had a fantastic dinner. My husband ordered a spicy vegetable soup and we got two orders of chicken tikka masala. He didn't like his soup and said it tasted like spicy water with some spices, so we will try something different next time. The chicken tikka masala was AWESOME, but the rice it came with was pretty bland. Although I felt it was fine when paired with the masala. The garlic butter naan we ordered was seriously amazing! And dipping it in the tikka masala sauce was the best part of the meal. Our server was very sweet and very efficient, however they were definitely understaffed for the amount of people dining. I think she may have been serving most of the tables in the place. So it took a little longer to get everything than it probably should have but it was never so long that it was ridiculous. The restaurant itself is beautiful, very clean and well designed. You would never be able to know such a nice place is hidden in the shopping mall. There was plenty of open parking and it seemed like the place didn't get busy until 8:30ish; definitely a later crowd. Our price for the soup, two dinners, naan and 20% tip was $45; which was very reasonable. We will absolutely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Felt really like home cooked Indian meal. Loved it. This is almost like 10th time I am here, and I just realized I missed to review them. Regular ala carte is good, but lunch buffets are amazing, especially during weekends. It's not just food, but we also get to see lot of Indians around, it almost feels like a restaurant in India!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for delicious quality food, but the service is terrible. That's the only problem I have with this place. It's terrible, my water was not even refilled this time around."}
{"text":"Everything was spicy and awesome. Had samosa chat, rava dosai, mutton chukka , chicken Briyani and chicken 65.. The Briyani was the best we had in a Indian restaurant .. allow yourself at least an hour to enjoy this delicious spread."}
{"text":"Well, Phoenix is officially back to having zero good Indian buffets.   I've been back to this establishment three times since my last review, and each time, the food has gotten progressively worse. I imagine that this probably stems from the restaurant's need to achieve uniformity, and it shows; the food is now officially as bad as the service. The days of fresh, carefully prepared offerings are gone, and your selections are now defined by greasy, unappealing food that ages in the slow, heartbreaking way that was previously the exclusive domain of my grandparents.   Avoid this place, unless you're going out specifically with poor service and bad food in mind."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The curry had outstanding flavor and the dish was amazing. We also got chicken kabobs which we wonderful."}
{"text":"I fear giving any buffet four stars because we all know that any buffet can differ by the hour with food drying up or pans staying empty for long periods of time and God only knows what else.  This place smells very fragrant when you walk in but I found it a little strange but ok. We were seated and we waited for someone to greet us and after a while the gentleman that sat us just tells us to go help ourselves at the buffet because it's a buffet.  Most of the food I tried was tasty. Nothing was too salty or too oily. All the chicken I tried was moist and tasty and even the fish was fresh enough so I could eat it.   Currently a grade \"A\" Maricopa inspection is posted.  The buffet line started with a savory donut that seemed fresh made and wasn't oily at all. Next came a few vegetable soups. I thought the rasam (tamarind based) one had much more flavor than the sambar but both soups were very light with vegetables. The rice dishes were made from long grain rice and were very fluffy. They had dum aloo (baby potato curry), channa palgk (spinach & chickpeas), Fresh plain naan bread, They offered 5 meat dishes and one egg dish and offered three desserts and some beverages.  I found that many of the vegetable dishes ran spicier than the meat dishes. Most tasted good to me. I didn't care for two dishes that I tried due to they were just too foreign to me and they might not really be bad but dhal tadka looked fun but lentil dumplings in yogurt I couldn't get down and the upma vegetarian dish looked like potatoes to me but it was porridge with vegetables that I also couldn't get down.  2 of the three desserts were interesting. The gulab jamun was like tiny donuts that were soaked in something fragrant and sweet and the halwa was a vegetable packed carrot pudding.  Compared to other buffets I've been this one is a smaller buffet but it seemed well taken care of on my visit and plates were cleared quickly.  It was almost like a trip to India but with much better traffic and it only cost $13.99 for the Sunday Buffet."}
{"text":"Appears they fixed the service problem. We saw 2 servers this night and both were on the ball and very knowledgable. Phew! The food was delish! best Butter Chicken I have ever had and was just the right heat. My husband got a lamb Masala extra hot and he built up quite a sweat. My sons tandoori chicken came out of the kitchen literally steaming hot. It was a little spicier than most tandoori chicken we have had but it was moist and flavorful.  LOTS of vegetarian choices on the menu and the server suggested coming for the lunch buffet because there are lots of options The atmosphere is very nice and Bollywood videos are always fun to watch."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.. Poor service.. We waited our entire meal to get a glass of water.. And I feel like I must have gotten the bottom of the barrel chicken because it was fatty and very chewy. In short, I just told my fiancé that this place has ruined the thought of eating chicken for a while.. High hopes.. Sad face.. We won't be coming back.. I don't want to risk another terrible meal!"}
{"text":"Went for buffet - long lines, food very greasy, not good.  Frequently ran out of food. No more visits here."}
{"text":"A great place for one of the biggest Indian buffets in Phoenix. Clean and calm place with great service and a nice balance between veg, non-veg , south &North."}
{"text":"-Delicious Chicken Tikka Masala -Nice decor -Lots of vegetarian options -Spicy (if you request it)  Went there for the first time with my boss and a group of coworkers from India. We had the lunch buffet and the food was very good. Sadly they didn't have Golab Jamun (the fluffy cheese balls soaked in syrup), neither I saw the free chai most Indian buffets have (I like both because in other Indian buffets I sweeten my (free) chai with Golab Jamun syrup)... Well, Fulla A.'s review says this is food from the Chennai area, maybe chai and Jamun Golab are not from there : (  OK, back to the food, they had interesting and varied options, all of them very tasty, and also had good options for vegetarian dishes (paneer dishes and vegetarian biryani)...  I don't remember the names but I tried almost everything and it was very good. They had like 3 different chicken dishes, 2 soups, salad, and various other items.  And they bring potato dosai to your table.  The hubby and I went there for dinner last night. They only seem to have the buffet for lunch, so we ordered from the regular menu.  We shared Chicken Tikka Masala (it comes with white rice) and garlic naan. Everything was very good. The chicken tikka was delicious. The sauce was the tastier and creamier we have ever had. I noticed it had like pieces of green herbs... usually the tikka sauce in other places is just orange-like color, this one had dark small pieces.  Service was good as well. Our hostess and server were 2 young girls and they were very polite and stopped by several times.  We will be back even though it is quite a drive."}
{"text":"A lot nicer than we thought it would be since the location was a Kyoto Bowl before. The food was great. It was a little too quiet, they didn't have any music playing. Service was nice and the food was tasty and decently priced."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  I've been here 2X and my experience has been nothing less than superb."}
{"text":"I was recently here twice in a span of three days.  Simply, food is fantastic. Service is abysmal.  It was a weekday night with a sparse occupancy. The ladies taking our orders had no clue what our orders were. We ordered for starters, Chilly Paneer. They brought the wrong dish to our table twice, and once they brought the wrong dish they had no clue what to do. The server actually went around to all other tables, asking if they'd ordered that dish. This happened many times. My friends were about to finish their main course until when the starter had not yet arrived and there was no sign if my main course dosa I'd ordered over 40 minutes ago. When questioned multiple times. The starter Chilly Paneer finally came to the table for almost dessert. And my main course still not yet arrived. After finally an hour since the initial order I am told that, my dosa actually cannot be prepared.  My friend ordered some bread (kulcha) for his dish, by the time the kulcha arrived, his dish was cold and dry.  This was a scene around all tables that night many of them angry and frustrated.  The whole night left us in a disappointed and unsatisfied. I was tempted to leave the place without paying.  Upon calling the manager up and explaining to him what was happening, he was surprisingly candid about the matter. His excuse that the serving ladies were new. He offered no apology or remedy to our complaints.  Finally to tip it all off when the bill arrived we were charged for stuff we didn't order.  The painful part I will admit is that the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Due to the service, I will NEVER go back. I love Indian food and have been to quite a few places in the valley.  Chennai's food was average... when we actually received what we ordered (dinner service).   Pros:  -Relatively fast turn around following ordering. -Food was pretty good, if nothing to write home about.  Cons:  -Servers had no idea what was on the menu. They came back twice to ask if \"that 'chinna' thing\" was a soup and then seemed to point at the menu at random, asking \"is that it?\" Channa masala. It's a pretty ubiquitous dish. And I can show it to you on the menu if you hand it to me. -Of the 6 dishes we ordered, 2 came accurately, 3 were entirely inaccurate (e.g. chaat when we'd ordered a curry dish), and 1 never showed up at all.   -They tried to charge us for dishes we didn't order in addition to those we did. -We had to ask the waitress for water 3x before she brought it.   If you're going to go there, go for the lunch buffet. The less you have to interact with the servers, the better."}
{"text":"Very clean, very nicely kept Indian restaurant.   I tried the buffet, and did not like the food. I am a vegan, wife tried the chicken and mentioned that she did not like the food either.   They have a very large selection in their buffet, Chettinad cusine from South India is known for lighter food, but strong flavors, not sure if they did not want patrons to stuff up their buffet, the flavor was not to be found on any of the items I tasted. Rating on food alone, i would not give it even the one star.  Service was great. So they got two stars. I will still go once more and try their Dinner or a weekday buffet. Will update soon."}
{"text":"Just an average South Indian restaurant which has the potential to be so much better.  Vada was good but the idly was definitely not fresh. Service needs to be improved and overall cleanliness including restroom can be better.  I will come back here when I crave dosas in Phoenix, but with no high expectations :)"}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the food only! The quality and taste of the food is phenomenal, the best I have had in the valley so far. However, the service is horrible. Actually horrible is an understatement. If you make the mistake of going on a Friday or Saturday evening be prepared to wait and wait long to be seated, asked for your order and served. I hope they put some serious thought in improving the service because the food is boss!"}
{"text":"A decent place to eat good Indian food. They are consistent with their menu and taste and I found at least 60% of the menu appeasing at any given day and I was never disappointed. Noise levels can get high during weekends and it can be hard to hear your friend sitting 2 feet away from you lol. Not a great fan of their dessert menu. Don't even think of trying their kulfi!!! Just don't mess with it!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, this my favorite restaurant. Their workers are extremely friendly. Environment is clean and relaxing. Above all, food is well balanced and extremely tasty !! Being an Indian, I can tell that the spices are very well balanced and used with caution. Certainly one of the best Indian restaurants in this state. I specifically liked their noon/afternoon buffet as one can try many dishes at less cost. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They have improved a lot compared to opening week/month. The Dosas are good compared to other Indian Restaurants near by. Now they have Kothu Paratha !!  Service is good and improving a lot."}
{"text":"2 stars for the awesome food. All that we ordered tasted good. But the service was below par. Especially this one server,  Arshad. He threw too much attitude!  Customer service is a very basic necessity when you decide to run a restaurant. The minimum one can do is be polite while taking orders, you needn't smile, needn't go out of the way to help customers. But you CANNOT be rude and outright snappy! We were there for a family get together and he began by not helping to seat us, not getting silverware, and when we tried to place orders for some bottled beverages, he refused to get them saying \"kitchen is closed\"! Couple of other families had bad experiences with the service too. But 2 other servers were the saving grace of our evening.  Overall, good food, bad service."}
{"text":"Good quality and tasty Indian food. My husband and I were here for dinner on Saturday night. We were seated in about 15mins. Appreciable effort by the staff to seat the couples and the families with babies/kids in separate spaces, so the overall dining experience was improved for everyone.   Our waiter helped us choosing from the menu, and I must say it was great assistance! We ordered a Gobi Machurian Dry for starters, and then a Plain Dosa and Onion Rava Dosa for main course. Dosas were crisp and made well, and sambar and chutneys were tasty too. I would've liked my Dosa slightly hotter, but nevertheless, it was very crowded so can understand the busy kitchen.  We'll surely be going back to try the rest of the menu! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"In Short :  Tasty, Spicy South Indian Food, but the quality lacks consistency.  Nice Ambiance. Service was bad before, but it has improved a lot now.  Details : Lunch Buffets: Been a patron at this restaurant during my year's stay in Glendale. (2013) Lunch Buffets on Weekdays has a small but nice menu.I wold recommend their Biryani. Lunch Buffets on Weekends has lot many options, but Vegetarians may not find the taste so exciting. I would recommend their fish on Weekend buffets.  Dinner (A la Carte) : All curries are prepared with Southern Spice levels...which means you will sweat if you order moderate or high spice levels. :) Uttappam and Dosas are well prepared and are served with good cutneys. Mini Idli's do not come soaked in Sambar. ;) Biryani(s) are tasty but not as good as Bawarchi. (Near Scottsdale).  My Favorite of all is \"Schezwan fried rice\" with 'Chicken 65'. I would recommend it for all those who crave Ultra Spicy Food.   Cons : Many times, the same dish did not taste the same when ordered on different days. (Which means I cannot have a favorite).  The service at the beginning of 2013 was too bad. (I agree with some other yelpers). At times they even forgot some of my orders. But they have improved towards the end of 2013."}
{"text":"I was fan of Chennai Chettinad and was quite frequent there.But now stop going there. Their food is still good and tasty but lately there service is quite bad and lethargic.  So if you are really looking for good food and don't mind poor service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Very poor service and poor management food quality is between ok and bad on weekends especially buffet if you have ever been to some other chennai chettinad in U.S. you should never come to place  Only medu wada is good but not worth to come to this place."}
{"text":"We been to this restaurant on Sunday . We ordered gobi Manchuria as appetizer which was so salty that we couldn't eat and for main course we ordered malia kofta which had no salt in it then panner butter masala was very sweet and not authentic at all. There was no one to even come and ask how the food is. Worst customer service. People who have babies be aware there is No CHANGING TABLE IN RESTROOM I had to put my baby down on floor to change diaper. We will not be going to this restaurant and I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible! We ordered a plate of Idli, medhu vada and samosa. It was poor in taste. The chutney was smelly and tasted stale.  Then we thought of giving them another chance. We ordered Onion Tomato Uthappa, a masala dosa and a Chicken curry. The curry tasted as if it was full of raw and uncooked masala. The uthappa was extremely oily. The masala dosa was very bland.   To top it all, we all got a stomach bug the same night and couldn't sleep the entire night.   Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for true southern Indian food, this is the place. We walked in an hour before they closed and the place was packed with Indian families. Us and one other couple were the only non-Indian people there.   The food was amazing, vegetable pakoras, masala Dosa, coconut special Dosa, curry and garlic nan... Everything was GREAT!"}
{"text":"We ordered to go - Veg Hakka noodles was one of the items. I don't remember reading anything about spice levels regarding the item. The person who took my order did not ask me about the spice level I want. After coming home, I very eagerly opened my Togo to only find that it was the spiciest I had ever eaten. Inspite of adding 5 spoons of sugar to it, my tongue was on fire. It tasted like at least 10 or more red chillies spicy. I called up the restaurant and inquired about this. Their response was that Veg Hakka noodles is usually at that spice level. The person who took my call doesn't know who took my order. He also said he doesn't know why the other person did not ask me my spice level. This brings two points: 1) How am I to know that there is a set spice level for something? 2) If at the time of order, no spice level preference has been mentioned, why is the default spice level the highest? 3) Is the person taking my order trained enough to ask all pertinent questions? Horrible experience! If there is a chance to give 'zero', I would!"}
{"text":"More towards the Indian side. I like the food. Pav bhaji was good. Triple schezwan noodles are also good. Also the vada pav.  I can come again"}
{"text":"The spread would be nothing if the flavor isn't there, and I'm pleased to say though that it hits the spot. They strike a good balance between burning hot and lips tingling spicy, I'm also glad to say service was good. Glad I found a place to visit again for quick lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Ha. Back again. Pani Pori never disappoints. Samosa, excellent.  Pappadums, a bit too oily and not very crisp  I get chicken khoulapouri (something like that) I'm warned it's spicy, and not much they can do to tame it. I go for it. Delicious!!! Just a fraction over my spicy tolerance but so good. Be prepared to eat a little more rice, Naan and the intermittent rata to cool down your flaming mouth.  Husband not in the mood for spice (odd) chooses the chicken Korma. It was mild, decent flavor but wouldn't order it again. A bit too weird and no one at the table is fond of it.   The winner is my brother, the birthday boy!! He chooses chicken tikka masala and we chide him about going too gringo, white bread, safe choice dish.  But it was so damn good! Outranked our entrees and he had the last laugh (as I continued to get too full to eat the rest of my meal because of all the water and bread I was eating) lol  I did manage dessert, rasmalai. Wonderful. Again cool, creamy, sweet. Also helps with my swollen taste buds. Kidding. It wasn't that bad.  I do love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice people.  We ordered chicken tikka masala and Dal Makhani and Veg Binaloo and buttered and garlic naan.  Everything was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times prior and it was OK. Not the greatest, not the worst. Was nearby today and decided to stop in for lunch. The place was packed, but they refused to seat us and said they were closed. Obviously they were not closed as the door was not locked and there were people inside eating.  Turns out they stop serving lunch at 2:30. I just felt the way they said it was very rude. How about you say - sorry, we just stopped serving lunch - or something similar, not just an abrupt \"we're closed\".  We almost felt they said that because we are not Indian. Only when I looked at the hours on the door did I realize that they stop serving lunch at 2:30. Just a weird experience."}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian food... Being a veggie i found it hard to cover grounds to taste all the dishes... Will visit again"}
{"text":"This place is somewhere that I will not return. After seeing reviews here, I thought that going to this restaurant for the lunch buffet was a good idea. However, a good portion of the food was not palatable.   Dishes that were okay: - the rice - chicken biryani (cold but flavorful) - chicken tikka masala (some of this chicken was very overcooked, but at least palatable) - naan - gulab jabun (like a donut hole - delicious)  Dishes that were not decent: - appetizer (some donut looking thing) - paneer mutter masala (this is usually one of my favorite dishes, but was disgusting!) - fish (I don't know why I tried fish at a buffet, but not impressed) - curry chicken  I thought just the service would be bad, and it was. I was expecting that. Did not get a refill.  This was somewhat expected with the comments on here that I read before choosing this restaurant. I can totally accept poor service if the food tastes good.   Overall, I paid 14.09 for this meal, and did not even eat a full plate because unfortunately on the two plates I did have, not everything was worthy of being put into my body as it would taste so bad going down. I have been eating Indian food for over 10 years. I love it and this was such a sad food experience. After spending the past summer in Berkeley and thoroughly enjoying all of the fabulous Indian restaurants there, it is so disappointing that it so extremely difficult to find a decent Indian restaurant in the north Valley. The last time I enjoyed Indian food in Phoenix area was when I went to Tempe but that is too long of a journey from where I live now. The struggle to find decent Indian food in the North Valley continues, but I know that I will definitely not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"What can I say - it's a buffet! You can fill your plate as many times as you want. Service is prompt & place is extremely clean. Bring your appetite..."}
{"text":"Best buffet..nice ambiance and tasty food.. Definitely i'm a fan.. I strongly recommend this to friends"}
{"text":"While visiting Scottsdale we realized we needed to get away from there asap. Discovered this place when traveling west. Awesome joint! I thoroughly enjoyed their Gobi Chettinaad Masala & Aloo Mutter. Their Mango Lassi was yummy. Wish I was able to eat more but I was so full! The waiter who I believe was the owner was super friendly."}
{"text":"Very bad experience overall.  First - no bottled water  Second - no ice cream  I should have immediately moved out, but I still gave benefit of doubt.  Probably they are out of water and Ice-cream at 6:15 pm when they opened the restaurant at 5:30 PM.  But the worst part was food.  We ordered mixed veg curry. You can't taste anything, it was loaded with spices (garam masala). It was so bad, I started having headache the moment I ate it. It's not the kind of spicy food you enjoy, it was just bad masala."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Atmosphere was alright.  Service was lacking, but it was a buffet so it did not bother me.  They should have just had self service drink stations.    I was in a group of 10 during a work lunch.  We all paid separately.  Even though it was a buffet, we were still charged an 18% gratuity.    This is just price gouging with a hidden surcharge, as it was no extra difficulty to seat or accommodate us.  In fact it allowed for a greater accommodation density within the restaurant.  If the cost had been 18% higher up front and not hidden, I would have complained that the price was a bit high but still a 5 star experience.    For poor judgement in trying to cheat their customers, I would suggest complaining to the restaurant about this.  Or not going."}
{"text":"Had another great meal here. The waitress was a delight and very helpful and attentive. Some of her helpers were not quite \"with it\" but the food was great and very tasty."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious but unfortunately the service was pretty awful. We felt unwanted a majority of the time but the second we ate our food we were like...eh it's worth it haha"}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food and wanted to try this restaurant for the first time. I got there at 1:30 PM and we were told (along with a separate big group) that they were out of food so we had to leave. How does a restaurant run out of food? So bizarre."}
{"text":"This place is really going downhill. The Dosas they serve in buffet, are now plain dosas instead of masala dosa, Really !! how many potatoes is it that go in one dosa. This is really bad. Now the drinks, no drinks at all, in every buffett, there has to be a chai (i'm sorry if i'm repeating myself). The sweets earlier used to be 4, now its down to 2.. why is that so ?? these are clear signs that they are just going down on their quality. Sambar today tasted kind of sweet. . Vada tray was empty for i dont know how long, nobody was looking around to make sure it is filled up..  For someone who is coming for the first time or probably second time, the place might appeal to them, but not to us now. also you have to go to the counter and line up to pay the bill, now they are not coming to your table with the check. There is absolutely no service they are doing except filling water glasses."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food it always great, with exception of the buffet but that's my own personal issue; I hate buffets.   I always start with samosas and pani poori! I looooove pani poori I'm so happy they have this dish and the chutney with is is awesome! The samosas are huge here and veeeeery crispy filled with lots of deliciousness! (I also recommend the samosa chaat and bhel poori - the flavored are all blended together for you).  As far as entrees- I've had the chicken tikka masala, all I can say is yum! The malai kofta here is the best I've ever had, but it's pretty rich and very difficult to finish! The lamb kurma is tender and always has great flavor. Chicken saag was pretty good but not as much flavor as many of the other dishes. If you have friends that want more of a Chinese dish try the manchurian dishes; I've had chicken and gobi (cauliflower) both are good. Oh and I can't forget the dosai. Dosai is hard to find and it's always wonderful here!  The food does run a little spicy, even if you enjoy the spicier dishes like me, but can ask for light spice.   The only reason they got a 4 is because service can be less than good. Hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"Buffet here is great. Lot of items that we can't even try all of them. Should improve on the spice level."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch buffet mainly because of the hype in and around the area.  But it wasn't up to the expectations and lot costlier for such type of buffet. Oily curries, minimal varieties in the buffet, not that great ambience. It's okay to try here but definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Even without the food poisoning this place was 1 star.  Expensive, food way below average.  I got food poisoning- no question from the food here.  For the Buffett we had 7 people with us, so they tacked on 18 percent gratuity even though they did not serve the table (just threw down water).  So our bill was over 15 dollars each for lunch. The worst Indian place I have ever been too."}
{"text":"Indian cooking is an art. Either you can make excellent food or make some trash and call it food. This restaurant belongs to the later category. Upon the insistence of one of my friend we decided to give this place a try. AS soon as We entered the restaurant, we found it to be noisy, full of screaming kids and quite dirty. My friend kept assuring me that the food is \"really good\" It was Christmas day. So, there were hardly any restaurants that I frequent were open. Hence against my better judgement, I decided to give it a try. BIG MISTAKE. It was Buffet style food service. Almost all dishes wee running out. Many people seem to be waiting for Nan (Bread). It took almost 25 minutes for Nan to come out of the kitchen. All of it disappeared within 5 seconds. The guy who was wandering around ordering the wait staff (wearing dirty clothes) appear to have no clue as to what was gong on. When I called him and told him about lack of many dishes, he shook his head and walked away. My elderly mother wanted to use the rest room. One of them was shut permanently with a board hanging outside saying \"out of order\" To make matters worse, my mom who barely ate anything, came home and complained of pain in the abdomen. Soon after she vomited the meal she ate with severe cramps. Given the fact this place was outright filthy, I am not surprised more people did not get ill in the restaurant itself. My next step would be to inform the county authorities to look into the cleanliness and food handling at this place. Second, inform FDA to inspect the entire premise to make sure other people do not get sick. If there is anything like MINUS 5 star, they deserve it. You still want to try it. Go ahead. Do not blame anyone you were not forewarned."}
{"text":"Food is very good! Service is the worst of the worst! Servers everywhere but no one to direct them to do their jobs. Servers do not smile..."}
{"text":"Fave South Indian place to dine! I love it!"}
{"text":"ok food but terrible service.  men's bathroom ran out of soap.  Which means people who work their did not wash their hands with soap.  I lost my appetite after seeing that!! Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"I like the lunch buffet. The naan and paneer butter curry is delicious so are the biryani and chicken curry.Appetizers are good too. The lunch buffet is worth every penny specially for good eaters . They have stopped dosa as part of the buffet which is sad cuz it was one of my husbands favorites. Nonetheless the buffet is delicious and I am definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"When I first started going to Chennai Chettinaad's buffet, about a year ago, the food was good. It was fresh, and I particularly remember the chole being outstanding. Even my Indian boyfriend, who has substantially more refined taste in Indian food than I do, really liked this place. However, this place has taken an enormous nose dive recently. The last several times I've been, the food had been noticeably old, with a crust starting to form on some dishes and the oil all separated. The food isn't even hot anymore on the buffet line--it's the kind of lukewarm that makes you wonder if you're going to get food poisoning from it. In addition, the general cleanliness has also gone downhill, and the last time I was there, my shoes stuck to the floor from un-mopped spills and the first plate I took at the buffet was sticky. Honestly, the quality of this place is comparable to the six-dollar Indian buffet I used to go to in Tempe when I was a broke college student, before I decided I wasn't THAT broke of a college student and upgraded to the $7.50 Indian buffet. Unfortunately, Chennai Chettinaad charges $13 a person weekends, which is absolutely crazy given the poor quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great authentic South Indian food.  There is a great variety of choices and the lunch buffets are awesome! The dosas are great and the malai kofta is probably the best in the valley. The only thing put of place is the fact that Hindi music is played there instead of Tamil music. That would be like going to an Italian restaurant that played German music.."}
{"text":"Average food.. Too much crowd... Long queue for the buffet...They can separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian.. You should go before 11:30 AM to avoid the rush... Hope they bring quality to food..."}
{"text":"This place is super good! Even though the place was kinda busy, we still got really great service and the food came out really fast."}
{"text":"Way too spicy...Could cut down on the spice level. Kids loved the mini idlis.."}
{"text":"Went there last week for the first time, I am fairly new to Indian cuisine, so have been trying new places. The lunch buffet here was really nice with a plentiful selection of varied dishes. The selections were well stocked and looked and tasted very fresh. The only thing I was disappointed with was our server did not bring us any Dosas, although we did see others bringing them out to other tables. The place was quite packed, mid day on a Friday lunch rush, and our server did refill our beverages often, so overall it was a very good experience and I would visit again."}
{"text":"The food is great. I've ordered chicken tikka masala and my friend had lamb vindaloo. Both dishes were fantastic, the masala was creamy and full of flavor, and vindaloo was divine. The only downside is a super slow service"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING LUNCH BUFFET!!!   I am giving this restaurant 5 stars based on the lunch buffet and cleanliness.   I come here often, about 5 times a month, with family or friends for the amazing selection at their lunch buffet. Friday through Sunday is my favorite time to come because the food is much spicier. Beware, this place is PACKED on those days. If you prefer it on the mild side then stick with the Monday - Thursday buffet or come during dinner hours when you can order it however you prefer. I have noticed that the people in my party are usually the only non-Indian people dining here, which is an excellent sign that the food is authentic. I've never been to India, so unfortunately I cannot say for certain.   This restaurant is always very clean. The service can be hit or miss; sometimes we get fantastic service and other times not so much, but that may be due to a communication barrier that the food more than makes up for.   Tips:  Great place for vegetarians who like it spicy. (Yes, they do also serve meat.) Be sure and try Rasam & Sambar soups, they are both delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!!! Love it! So delicious and original Indian food!!! Thx so much for owners!"}
{"text":"The food is good. But like a lot of Indian restaurants, this place suffers massively from a lack of good service. They used to have a 'Thali' that often came with a couple of dishes missing. Buffets start 30 minutes later than the advertised time.  One evening, we were seated immediately. The restaurant was a little more than half-full. But no one came our way for at least 20 minutes. Then, someone brought us some water and disappeared. Then, another person brought us the menu and disappeared. After waiting for an hour, they came to us and said, \"You can order now, but the food will take another hour or hour and a half to get ready. We are very busy\" . Really??"}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet and was disappointed with the selection of food,  the taste of food, and the service.  The selection was lacking,  especially for a vegetarian customer,  which is surprising for an Indian restaurant.  Not all of the food appeared fresh and not all was stocked well or labeled.  The taste was okay but nothing to write home about.  No drinks,  aside from water,  were offered with the lunch buffet.  My service was abissmal, the only time someone cane to the table was to drop off the check and then ask if I already paid a minute later.  No one asked how I was doing,  took any dirty plates from the table,  refilled water,  gave me a napkin,  etc. All the tables had prefilled glasses of water on them.  Rather than removing three glasses from my table,  they cubed them with coaster napkins and slid then to the side of the table so they could be used for the next guests.  Gross! I will never return to this pretentious, low quality restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Chennai Chettinad every so often for the past year or so and I think the quality and consistency of the food has really declined. On some visits, we have had dishes arrive fresh and tasting really good. On the next visit, the same dish might come lukewarm, with no salt, and tasting like it was made a few days ago. Service will vary too - sometimes the silver and cups are dirty and we need new ones. Sometimes the server is friendly and attentive - on other days, we almost have to go find them ourselves when we need the check.   When it's a good day, I really like the yellow dal and vegetable korma. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken here, because they use a lot of dark meat, so I tend to stay vegetarian when at Chennai Chettinad. I come here because the food is not bad and my coworkers like the place still, but between the inconsistent food and terrible service, I wouldn't recommmend it unless you live very close nearby."}
{"text":"We stopped in Sunday (Father's Day) and ordered the Aloo Gobi and a couple of Chaats. Remember now, I am an Indian food junkie and know my food extremely well. That comes with years of experience and taste buds akin to a wine or tea taster in regards to North and South Indian food. Only difference is I don't spit it out, no matter how hot. Enough said. Now aside from the ambiance/fragrance which was fair to good, the service turned out to be on the good side although it began lukewarm and unimpressive. Let me explain further. The staff noticed after a while that we had not dug into our dishes. At 6 pm only four to five tables were taken, when two of them came over and expressed concern over our lack of enthusiasm. When I told them I'd ordered the food mild the young lady asked if we would like another plate milder we agreed. I added extra yogurt and tamarind sauce to my chaat to soften up and tone down the samosa and pappadi. We had also ordered samosa and they came out rock hard and very spicy hot. The inside stuffing was dark and not yellow/orange as it ought to be. After soaking them in yogurt and tamarind sauce I managed to get it down. I think we hydrated very well as a result. It was somewhat comforting to have them show genuine concern to make sure we did not leave unsatiated. Having told myself I won't be returning I now convinced myself to at least give the buffet a try one day. With my vast experience spanning six decades I'll be positioned to critique the food one more time based on the buffet and other restaurants."}
{"text":"Buffet was ok, with some items not very hot.  I noticed other tables had received dosas on their table, but we were never asked nor brought any.  Near the end of the meal I finally flagged a server and asked, and only then was it brought.  This restaurant is not a typical, pure Indian fare because they do have some \"fusion\" or whatever you call it with other dishes from other countries."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place for lunch buffet. You feel like you are standing in line at a soup kitchen as the food is kept in a corner with virtually limited access. It will take you up to 15 minutes to get some food on the buffet line depending upon the day of the week. By the time you reach the food you realize that half of it is empty.  I wonder if this is by design since you end up eating a very limited amount of food. You might be lucky if you are able to get one full plate of food on Fridays. I would rather go to Mayuri palace or Karaikudi palace for a lunch buffet than this place especially on Fridays. Food here is spicier than the other places so I enjoy it but that's up to you."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, but very chili. They seem to have gotten tastier but chilier over the years, even according to people who can handle it better than me. I hear the gobi machurian, biryanis, masala dosas, goat, and chicken chetinaad are really good.  \"Mild\" is still pretty hot. On the bright side, they have tasty yogurt to slather on your food if you can't handle these things, like me. The Kashmiri naan also doubles as dessert, it's delicious.   As far as service goes, there's one waitress who is amazing, but otherwise things move a little slow."}
