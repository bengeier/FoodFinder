{"text":"We just got back from a great dinner at Pasta P (new nickname I see). I had really slow service almost a year ago and hadnt been back since. This year we've already been twice and both times, the service has been right on point, the wine list well suited my \"no sommelier here\" taste. We both ate the special, ( I know, Italian cardinal rule #1 was broken. No one orders the same thing so everyone can \"taste\" something new or different) Linguine with Fresh Dungenous crab & fresh veggies. Yum yum yum. Service was quick, took away salad plate brought entree. Iced tea was so good I asked for a to-go cup (think thirstbuster size) $40 (with tip) for two specials, one salad, a water and major iced tea....not bad for a boring Tuesaday night."}
{"text":"Pasta Pomodoro is chain Italian's answer to Peet's Coffee.  Good consistent modern Italian, almost a neighborhood place and not as corporate as Starbucks.  And much like Peet's, Pasta Pomodoro also originated from the San Francisco bay area.

You're welcomed with bread and a delicious olive oil basil parsley dip.  The apps are also delicious with stand outs like the shrimp with garlic and chili (though the menu said cast iron pan, ours came on regular plate).   The ravioli with brown butter and sage is so good that I usually order it as a main.  A terrific classic pasta dish is vongole with linguine.

If you don't have a great neighborhood Italian joint, then Pasta Pomodoro will take care of you in a pinch."}
{"text":"Very sad day......they had the best Tortellini.....Rest in peace Pasta Pomodoro"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice and had an okay experience both times.  As one reviewer mentioned earlier, it is safe Italian food...The service is decent and the food as well.
First visit - Undercooked pasta had to be sent back and \"fixed\"....meh!
Second visit - Semi-good fettuccine alfredo with chicken...
If there is a third visit, I'll need to be blown out of the water for a fourth star to be considered.  
That's all I got to say about that!"}
{"text":"Long time no yelp... so, I'm picky when it comes to Italian food and not a big fan of chain restaurants either. But this place is always GOOD. Took a date there Saturday night, I had the special risotto w/ clams, shrimp- very tasty. Also the Ravioli di Zucca (ravioli with brown sugar and parmesan) was a great starting appetizer. 

The only bad things about the night was the baby screaming a few tables down from us, oh... and the date. lol."}
{"text":"Tried Pasta Pomodoro last night - was recommended by the couple who joined us.  We were actually going for the happy hour - half priced appetizers - but missed it by a few minutes.  Bummer...so we had to settle for full priced dinner. 

Tried the Polenta Farcita (blah, I'm not a polenta fan), Gamberi (very flavorful - best part of the meal) and Tortellini alla Panna (again blah, nothing to write home about.) The complimentary bread was okay, but the complimentary pesto sauce they served was rather good. 

Nothing special. Decent food and wine selection, but nothing I will rush back for.  If at the Promenade and want good food try Flo's which is always a sure thing."}
{"text":"Pasta Pomodoro is slightly above average compared to most chain Italian restaurants. It has a vibe which makes it seem like a little Italian bistro you might come across in New York City. The two times I've been there, I've ordered their tortellini soup and Cesar salad. Both were delicious.  The soup is very flavorful and the Cesar salad was great with tasty shavings of Pecorino cheese. The prices are pretty reasonable, and they have a decent amount of choices on their lunch menu.  As I was leaving, I noticed a flier outside that said on Tuesday evenings they host local Jazz musicians. I must say, in my book, a little jazz and some good Italian food is a great way to spend an evening."}
{"text":"I will agree with everything Calamari F. has to say and also throw in the fact that OMG the kids on LAGUNA BEACH eat at Pasta Pomodoro!!  ;)

But to reiterate, its safe, its predictable, its not that expensive and if you are near PV mall and can't venture too far it is pretty good considering the other choices within the area.  

They get another star from me because the service was excellent  when I have gone there and that makes a big difference to me.  Calamari F. did point out that service has been hit or miss, but they were great the few time I have been there.  I wish I could give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.  Since it is so small I am a little intimidated to bring my small children though.  The food is good and if you sign up for their online club you get coupons fairly frequently."}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time. I live practically across the street. It never dawned on me to go... until one fateful night when an intense pasta craving (read: I don't feel like making pasta craving) came over me. After a swift mafia- style u-turn into the parking lot, the hubski and  arrived at Pasta Pomodoro.

We were seated outside. The weather was nice. Something was missing. I looked across the parking lot and saw My Big Fat Greek Restaurant- a place carrying a scathing review from yours truly. It hit me. We were sitting outside and there was a major lack of cockroach. I know they are not supposed to inhabit restaurants, even the outside areas, but after my experience at MBFGR, I figured the area had a veritable infestation, Brooklyn-style. Not so. We didn't see one.
We did, however, see a cute little kitten running through the bushes. Not begging for food. Just being cute. Awwwww.

I ordered the ravioli di magro with pomodoro sauce- not a fan of gorgonzola, but it was an option. Tasty. It was perfectly al dente. Hubski had the fettuccine alfredo. That was lighter than most I have tried and it was tasty. One time, in NYC, I tried a fettuccine alfredo which was made at the table with steaming pasta in a gigantic wheel of cheese. It wasn't as good as that, but almost.

We'll go back- especially for the bellinis. If you don't know what a bellini is, drop everything right now and go to Pasta Pomodoro."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and had excellent service.  Had 3 friends with me who all liked their dish.  3 out of the 4 dishes were amazing while the 4th was good but nothing to be happy about.  gemeli was great.  and my chicken f alfredo was great as well.  Bread and pesto was great too for the price you are paying on the meal.  I will be going back more often.  Once a week."}
{"text":"I really Love this place!
I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things. 

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:
roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,
sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.
The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.

I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!

My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This is definitely safe Italian food. The wine was decent, the service was mediocre, and I'll probably go back if I'm with my mom and we're shopping at PV.

There's not really a whole lot more to say about this place. Though, the pesto oil they give you with bread is mighty tasty."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pasta P.  I've been to this location, as well as a couple of the others ones in Phoenix and Scottsdale and I find them all to be pretty consistent. 

They serve tasty bread and olive oil for you to snack on while your food is cooking and the menu is filled with different pastas and salads to choose from. 

I really like their spinach salad and their raviolis. So good! And the staff has always been attentive and friendly the time's I've gone. 

But once when we had a new server, my friend wasn't paying attention and was gesturing wildly while telling a story. Just as the server was about to set down her plate, her arm hit it and it all went flying.  Luckily no one was burned by the flying tomato sauce (it was hot!) but the server ended up wearing most of her meal. It was an embarassing moment for all of us and I haven't been back to this location since. And when I go, my friend won't be invited.  :)"}
{"text":"What a tragedy this place closed. There was no better place to go for Spag' and meatballs."}
{"text":"Modern Italian cuisine and decor.  The delicious menu makes it difficult to decide what to order.  The wine menu was just as difficult (luckily the waitress made a great suggestion)!  My sister and I were both pleasantly surprised with our meal.  The waitress was very sweet and the atmosphere was great for the two of us to catch up in.  The best part was the delightfully affordable tab at the end!  We really liked this place!"}
