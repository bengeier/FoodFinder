{"text":"Wow, what happened here!? I had heard that Giuseppe left and much of the staff with him. Now the place is a shadow of its old self. No cocktail menu, because they want you to focus on the wine. That would be cool if the wine list were longer, I guess. The area needed the cocktail bar that was the old Livermore, not this new business when we have Dinette and Taglio for Italian style food.   They do have more filling food now and it looks a lot like the Bar Marco menu but vaguely more Italian. I'm sure it's fine but I don't really care to try it because I was coming here for a cocktail before dinner elsewhere.   Thankfully, they made me an \"off menu\" Last Word from the \"off menu\" list of five cocktails they still make. It was fine, but I won't be back since I came here for the drinks and Giuseppe. I'd give up one or the other, but to lose both changed this place for the worse."}
{"text":"Very similar to it's counterpart, Bar Marco in quality of cocktails, but with every aspect of the bar a little simpler.  The cocktail menu is pared down to classics and the food menu is really just snacks and nibbles.  The space is very similar to Bar Marco, but the decor seems to lack the finish that Bar Marco has.  Good place for a laid back drink on the week nights, which is probably the biggest draw for me!  Love that there are more options in the East End for craft cocktails!!  There's also plenty of street parking.  Service was also very attentive and friendly, so no complaints here.  Just remember that this isn't Bar Marco, so the bartender isn't going to concoct a different cocktail each time.  They're more than happy to provide suggestions, but they do have the menu of cocktails for a reason."}
{"text":"I'll first start by saying that I really enjoy cocktail bars, so that's maybe the first thing that led me to really have a great experience here.   It was a Sunday but it was actually quite busy. The place was fairly dimly lit and my friends and I went in for some cocktails. The bartender was doing some neat tricks and seemed really amazing, and the cocktail list was pretty unique, which was really cool. Unfamiliar with most of the ingredients, we had to ask some questions, but the bartender was very helpful and explained everything perfectly. He also didn't seem bothered about the fact that my friend wanted a vodka martini, and still explained that the vermouth they use is french and he wanted her to try it with that. She liked it very much.   I had the attic queen, which was very good, with mezcal, which I don't usually like. The only downside about the drinks was that the death in the Gulf Stream that my friend ordered was incredibly strong, so be careful with some of them! I think it should have been a little better, but the others were great!  The spanakopita and marshmallows were both very good. Not really a meal available here, though, so don't come looking for plated entrees. I think it's mostly snacks and desserts. We didn't try many desserts, but will next time for sure. They looked so good!  The atmosphere, music, crowd, and staff were all really great. The food menu is limited; but the options they did have were very nice.   So happy to have a place that's fun and unique for my girlfriends and I to go!!   I recommend this bar for those who enjoy cocktails and knowledgable staff. Maybe not for dinner or really large groups, but still a great spot in the east side!"}
{"text":"i;ve been three times and think it's overpriced. the atmosphere is cold and whitewashed. We went Saturday for my friend's birthday and the bartender, who she knew, offered to make her a special drink + send over food, which in my experience means you are going to be comped.  At the end of the night we were charged $30 for a meat + cheese plate that we never ordered. While I may be perceived as another whiny pittsburgher who doesn't get good food and good drink, I will argue that having traveled all over the world and spent a good deal of time living in new york and boston, I've experienced plenty of delicious food and drink and you don't need to spend $120 on a night out. A $12 3 sip cocktail is b-o-r-i-n-g, unoriginal and overrated."}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails.  We went early for a cocktail before dinner.  I had a standard old-fashioned to see how their house-made bitters are.  (Excellent.). My wife also liked her  drink.  We were waited on immediately, and our drinks were served in under 5 minutes. Our bartender was very friendly and cool.    Awesome. Recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and atmosphere. Don and Abbey are amazing bartenders. Not only do they create terrific drinks but also exude a passion and joy for serving individuals. Really a special place."}
{"text":"This place caters to a very particular type of crowd. While they have some interesting craft cocktails, they don't have much else. No soda or juice to mix with, and not a ton of different liquors. They also have some of the slowest service I've ever seen. It took literally 30 minutes to get my first drink. I'd rather go to a dive bar and pay less than half the price for a drink I actually want in a fraction of the time."}
{"text":"Great place, very hip and love the tunes.   Great bartenders and servers!  This place has a few rooms that just seem to be a fun place to chill.   The only complaint is that the heat is terrible in here. I was soaked by the end of the night. Very weird that they don't try to fix that."}
{"text":"You \"Tenderized\" yourself, so you get one star like Tender does. You used to be a great place to get drinks, now you're trying this restaurant game, and I have one less place I want to go to for drinks."}
{"text":"No drink, no matter how incredible is worth a 40 minute wait. If you are only going to have intricate and unique drinks then perhaps having more than 2 bartenders is a good idea.   Abby is lovely and great. Ask anything of the other female bartender (Brittany?) and prepare to have eyes rolled at you. Bizarrely snobbish attitude, when all I would like is my check now that my glass has been empty for 25 minutes."}
{"text":"The easiest brunch place in the area to get a table at on the weekend. Get the bread pudding before your meal--it's one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The shirred eggs with tomato sauce were a unique, savory brunch dish. I wish the eggs were runnier instead of getting baked all the way through."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I plan to go back. The cocktails are delicious and the ambiance is pretty cool. I have yet to try any of the food though. My husband, two friends, and I were there celebrating my husband and I's legal marriage. When the owner found out he broke out some champagne for everyone in the bar to celebrate with us. It was very nice."}
{"text":"The $12 craft cocktail market in Pittsburgh is officially over saturated...  On a Saturday night the place was loud and crowed, but service was still pretty quick. However, the drink list is short, and for $12 a drink I didn't get the experience/complexity/portion I've come to expect from the Tender's and H&H's of the world.    Bonus points for a solid Negroni ($8?) and being accommodating when splitting the check."}
{"text":"The Livermore is a new place with old charm, solid drinks, and an ambience that left me unimpressed."}
{"text":"Sorry Livermore but you should have stuck with the cocktail bar idea. The whole restaurant thing with limiting people  to reservations is just lame. There's a pizza place next door, stick to the custom drinks. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This past weekend was my third visit, and if it wasn't my last, it'll be close to it. They changed their concept since I was here last, or so they announced at the door. Which gave me hope that the wonderful cocktails with the dreadful and clueless service would be a thing of the passed. I hoped in vain.  Their remodel involves the absorption of the Shadow Lounge next door, and also, for some reason they have stopped using the beautiful new doors they installed, and you must now enter through a narrow kitchen corridor. Not only is this confusing and unmarked, it adds the very unsanitary step of having people walk through the food preparation area which, as one of our party pointed out, is a bright line health code violation. Ew.   The new plan was extensively explained at the door, including their no tipping policy. (to match Bar Marco) I understand the upside of the policy, and its potential to change, but what we saw was its downside, with a staff that neither knew nor cared about what they were serving, as they no longer had a stake in the issue. Much more surprising was the lack of cocktails. The Livermore is no longer a cocktail bar, its only claim to fame, but now does tapas, wine and beer.  The tapas were not bad, though both pricey and quite basic, they were tasty and reasonably well portioned. If those had been added to the cocktails, and the staff properly trained, they would have been moving up. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the beverages. The wine list contains just three reds and three whites, which I at first thought was a very gutsy move. Serving such a small selection requires a great deal of faith in you ability to choose. Sadly the wines, and we tried 4 out of six at the recommendation of the bartender, ranged for poor to downright unpleasant. All the wines were refrigerator cold, but even after warming they were harsh cheap wines, well below the price point or atmosphere of the place.  I admit, I didn't want to write a review like this. I wanted to see that they had realized they needed to improve training but had a good concept in place. Instead, they abandoned the concept, left the poor training in place and reopened with a new and less inviting concept. We can only hope that someone takes control of this place before it sinks altogether. Such great potential in that spot!"}
{"text":"New favorite Pittsburgh bar! The staff were friendly and attentive - to be honest, I was expecting the pretentiousness you find at other cocktail bars in the area. Not here ! The bartenders were more than happy to hear what I usually like and concoct a fitting cocktail creation - and the results were fabulous. We had a few apps as well that were equally divine - I highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates in particular. The whole experience left me smiling! Would recommend this highly to my friends."}
{"text":"Thankfully this totally confused establishment has closed. It was a good, popular bar that decided it wanted to be a restaurant that looked a lot more like a bar that then wanted to be a restaurant that was more for private parties that then decided it wanted to be a restaurant with a bar attached to it but would rarely be open.   Great location and space. Crappy ownership/mgmt/staff."}
{"text":"This is the new bar from the guys who brought the magnificent Bar Marco to Pittsburgh. The Livermore doesn't disappoint. This is a cool bar with great craft cocktails and tasty snacks. In East Liberty. This is the new hip neighborhood in Pittsburgh and these guys are here early. On night one the place was standing room only--a great sign of things to come.   The menu features a few specialty cocktails plus a list if classics. They also have a couple of wines by the glass and beer (bottled). The food menu is simple--crostini, salad, small sandwiches, bar snacks. The food is tasty but not complicated. You probably will come here for drinks and happen to get some food, not the other way around. That's not to say that the food isn't very good ( it is), but when everyone's having a rollicking good time and the bar is cranking out perfectly mixed craft cocktails somehow food can take a back seat in one's mind.   Check it out. You won't be disappointed! This is a great addition to not only East Liberty but also Pittsburgh more broadly."}
{"text":"I want my old hipster bartenders back!!!! Do not like the new Livermore. The change has been a disappointment to say the least. The drinks were unremarkable to say the least and the wait staff is definitely not invested. Sad to see the old place go. Where are the old bartenders working!?! I will go there...please come back!"}
{"text":"The owners are great. The drinks are very good.  This not a place to go to for food.  Drinks are the best.  I had an old fashioned and a manhattan, both were excellent and priced appropriately."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about this concept. I'm sitting here in a virtually empty, beautiful restaurant with palpably bored waitstaff. None can be bothered to smile. The restaurant serves a fixed menu for brunch so I have no choice in my lunch. This would be fine if A) there was at least a choice of an a la carte item or two or B) if the server spoke audibly enough so that one could hear what was on the day's menu.   The first course was comprised of two scones, both uninspired but fine enough. These were followed by a plate full of admittedly delicious - I mean, really nutty and smooth - prosciutto with a dollop of fresh ricotta. Figuring out how I was expected to eat it was interesting... do I schmear the prosciutto in the cheese? Do I wrap it around one of the accompanying bread sticks? No matter - it was tasty even if a bit strange.  Now I'm working on an absolutely perplexing salad of bitter greens, sliced radish and leeks. Raw leeks. Who in the heck eats (or serves) raw leeks? A more thoughtful or interesting dressing would help, but as is I kind of feel like I'm trying to eat a bowl full of stock veggies.  (Oh, man. The music just cut out and it is sooo quiet in here. This is a little awkward.)  My fourth course of quiche and a meatball has arrived. It is also a bit confusing (quiche and a meatball?) but it is supremely delicious. The crust on the quiche is flaky and just perfect, while the custard is light as air, flavored with thyme and reminiscent of Thanksgiving. It may be the best quiche I have ever had. As for its friend Meatball, it too is quite good. The meat mixture includes ground mortadella, which imparts a unique flavor that - you know what? - isn't half bad with a forkful of quiche.  The final course of two slices of cake - one lemon and one spice - has been packed to go because I am stuffed and also because I kind of want to get out of here. So, briefly, my take-aways:  1. Please don't serve raw leeks. 2. Maybe have a chalkboard out with the day's selections so diners know what they're in for? 3. Smile, people! You're salaried, and there's some tasty prosciutto in the kitchen. Maybe snag a slice or two and cheer up a bit?"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the evening there. The bar was full, but not hopelessly crowdy, and we were able to find seats at the bar. It's lively, but not too noisy, so you can talk. The cocktails (particularly enjoyed my sidecar) are good (but not cheap). I love the space, its large counter and and its big windows - it feels like you are somehow in the street, at the same time as inside. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a cool cocktail bar. It's a good place to go and ask for something off-menu, but they have many excellent suggestions as well. There isn't really food here. Three or so good beers available, but this is a cocktail place.  Kinda loud--could use some sound baffling--but a comfortable location in a fun neighborhood."}
{"text":"So, both times I've been here I've had a really fun night. The atmosphere is very sophisticated yet laid back. The bartenders are really nice and tend to your needs. I did have to flag one down on a Saturday night after sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes. The variety of the cocktails is extensive and great. The food I've had has been pretty good but overpriced. I think the owners want this place to be a little more upscale than it will turn out to be, hence the overpriced food and cocktails. However, I really did like the atmosphere and I know I'll be back again soon. I look forward to re-reviewing this place in the future."}
{"text":"My date and I ventured into the Livermore last night because he had been wanting to check it out. I'm glad we did because I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It reminded me of a bar I was in NYC. It was hipster yet casual. I had a glass of Pinot and my date had a mixed drink and a beer. We didn't have any food, but boy did it smell good. You can see right into the small kitchen and the chef looked like he knew what he was doing. There is also a back room with couches and a long bar. A large group of people came in while we were there and were seated back there. There was music and the girl were dancing. I actually am excited to get some friends together and go back!  One thing to note, they build the tip into the bill."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks on a weekday night. Great place, great staff!"}
{"text":"I was part of a party of 15  that reserved space early in the week for a weekend celebration. We arrived to find the serving staff less than energetic about out experience and not enough seats were set aside for us (even with 5 days notice) The vibe is great, however were we not made aware of any menu changes for their snacks or drinks. The home made chips were no longer available. We were even told they were out of bread (a staple of their snack menu). The cocktails are now straight prohibition style cocktails and they no longer serve a list of  Bar Marco's unbelievably good drinks. We tried to bring them a great deal of business and revenue to support this scene.  I am afraid to say that I'd rather make the trip to Bar Marco than this more convenient location with stellar ambiance."}
{"text":"\"Tapas\" = overpriced droplets of \"food\".  Staff seemed to act as though I was inconveniencing them by ordering a drink.   While surfing their Twitter mentions, also found an instance where they publicly called a patron a \"f**ktard\". Completely unacceptable as business professionals."}
{"text":"Best meatballs I have ever had! Hands down!  I went to The Livermore this past Saturday night with some friends.  We had the eggplant appetizer, mozzarella & tomato appetizer & the meatballs to start.Of course, they had very elegant titles but after I tasted each of them, I forgot everything else.  This is some of the best food I have ever tasted!  Chef Justin Steel takes Italian food to another level in the newly changing & very cool East Liberty area!   Our meal continued with three different types of pasta.  We ordered one with tomato sauce, one with pesto sauce and one that had sausage in it.  I know I am not doing justice to exactly what was in them but it doesn't matter!  They were all so delicious that my friends and I were completely stuffed!  (Did I mention that we literally licked all of the plates clean from the appetizers!) We couldn't pass up the Lavender panna cotta for dessert (which we shared) and it was heaven in a mouthful!  We found out the desserts come from their sister restaurant, Bar Marco in the Strip district and it was absolutely sinful.   Our waiter was perfectly attentive & Chef Steel stopped over to see how we were enjoying our meal (which of course we were!) We sat at a table, but the restaurant has very cool seating along the bar and around the windows and it was nice to see East Liberty so alive with so many people walking by.  I  would definitely recommend coming.  I'm so glad that they changed this from the previous bar to now an Italian restaurant.  I heard they also hired all new waitstaff when they re-opened.  Everyone was very friendly. You will not be disappointed.  We were also very pleased with the pricing. The portion sizes were perfect and it was worth every penny! The Livermore  along with Bar Marco does not accept gratuity.  I definitely believe that all of the staff was very high quality and made the evening more enjoyable.  P.S. I hear their cocktails are amazing... we had a bottle of wine that was perfectly picked for us!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience and cocktails and always enjoy interacting with the staff. I go there every few weeks to enjoy fresh cocktails with friends. I've also experienced the bartenders making unique specialty drinks that aren't on the menu when I ask them for something special. Specialty cocktails take a while to drink but this is a place you come to in order to relax and sip something delicious. If you wanna get wasted on shots as soon as you walk into a place, this might be the wrong place for you. The food is also delicious."}
{"text":"This was my introduction to craft cocktails which is ironic because they specialize in traditional cocktails.  I guess it was something about the way the bartender waxed poetically about the Socratic merits of balance and form as he whipped up a frothy top and craved out symmetric pedals into it.    At this point I recognized that I had before me a professional and so I proceeded to drop the menu.  After all, why would I even want to make a decision when I don't know the correct answer.  \"I love Manhattans but I there has to be something new out there that takes it to the next level.\"  Behold, five minutes later, the Black Mountain Stiletto.  I know, if you are very old you are probably thinking, but a Stiletto has Amaretto in it you fool, that ain't no damn Manhattan.  Correct, he swapped the Amaretto for Black Mountain which is an apple and black currant brandy liqueur.  A-ha, so the job of the sweet vermouth and the cherry bitters have just been taken up a notch.  And the lemon juice, which I would have never guessed, was pure alchemy.  It all came together so nicely.   I ordered the next round from the menu.  Why would I do that?  I guess I was under the influence of the euphoric first drink and feeling broke.  I think I had the actual manhattan.  A plain old ex-favorite of mine made perfectly, but diminished by the novel experience provided by the talented Mr. Fry."}
{"text":"I like to step out of my wheelhouse every once in a while.  As stated in another review, i am a beer drinker.  So The Livermore is not a place for me, but as I seek new experiences, we stopped in for dessert and drinks.    We ordered the happy hour features the $6 drinks.  There were 3 options: two of the drinks, I had no idea what any of the ingredients were.  As the very knowledgable bartender explained each drink, I got lost somewhere after egg whites.  She said old fashioned and I was sold.  My friend got the Pisco sour (with the egg whites)  She finely crafted the cocktails like a scientist in her laboratory.  Both had great flavors, but the real star was the dessert.    We had the salted caramel panna cotta.  They have seasonal flavors such as vanilla and lavendar.  The texture of the panna cotta was perfect plated with some caramel and some sea salt, served with a lavendar cookie.     This is not a bad review, it is just something I don't know about.  It would be like someone saying well today you are going to be left handed when you are right handed.  But I do know about dessert..."}
{"text":"The drinks and the staff here are top-notch.  However, the staff are quite obviously overworked.   So given the amount of time to make some of the drinks here combined with the customer vs. staff ratio, expect to wait at least 15 minutes between drink order time and the point when you actually receive said drink.   The other problem is the temperature there.   It usually feels like it's about 100 degrees inside."}
{"text":"I went to the grand opening of the Livermore and I am really excited about the food, drinks and ambiance.  The owners have kept most of the historical details intact and have lovingly restored the space.  The name Livermore comes from the legendary stock market trader and author of How to Trade Stocks, Jessie Livermore.  Livermore was famed for making and losing multi-million dollar fortunes and short selling during the stock market crashes in 1907 and 1929.  I think the restaurant captures a sense of the early 20th century, evoked by the high ceilings, stained glass and tile work.  The food here is all made from scratch, including the artisan bread.  One highlight is the delicious Crostini that come in 5 different varieties.  The drinks are made using old school techniques, they don't use any shortcuts, and they are all high quality.   Some cool things about the restaurant include an authentic antique cash register.  The bar is made from the wood salvaged from a bowling alley, so as you can imagine, it looks rather old and impressive.  Another feature is the huge shop window that looks out into the street.  This is definitely a cool place to hang out, I know that I will be back."}
{"text":"We went here for NYE and ended up leaving to go somewhere else before the end of the night. The drinks here are great. Very tasty. We had been here once before and went back because of the drinks and the atmosphere. However, the food ranged from unremarkable to not great. We ordered a cheese plate, which only had two cheeses. The server couldn't tell us what one of the cheeses was when we asked. We ordered the bagna cauda, which consisted of vegetables and an anchovy paste, and rigatoni with a cream sauce and prosciutto. The bagna cauda was just fishy and gross, though the vegetables were fine.  The rigatoni was completely average. Both dishes were tiny, I guess tapas style, but that wasn't exactly clear from the menu. We found the server unhelpful and inattentive. I believe in salaried servers, but this server made me feel like he wasn't otherwise properly incentivized to provide top notch service. Granted it was also NYE and he might have been distracted. Anyway, moral of the story: the drinks are good and the atmosphere is cute/trendy, but everything else is sort of meh."}
{"text":"I have been to the Livermore twice now, once on a Thursday towards the evening when it opened, and now again on a Saturday night.  I was there with a girlfriend of mine after just having dined at Casa Rasta next door.  It's a neat space and owned by the Bar Marco crew, so they have extended the model of craft mixology with premium ingredients.  It was crowded but not brimmed, [it was 10:30pm so this may change throughout the remainder of a Saturday. I ordered a whiskey sour with the added non-required egg white ingredient. The mixologist was good enough to ask which version I preferred.  Now to outline the common criticism of the bar: It's too popular!  Each of our drinks took 20 minutes to get to us and another 15 minutes to get the attention for the final bill. Usually, this is a death-sentence for a popular bar however the Livermore will get a pass.  As the model serves craft drinks only [no soft drink products in the vicinity] a drink will take a minimum of 3 minutes to make from start to finish + ordering time + adding the drink to queue [cash register] + delivery. this averages to at least 5 minutes a drink per customer.   At a rate of 15-20 intended orders over a span of 30 minutes will make it impossible for this bar to deliver a premium drink in a \"manageable\" popular bar delivery time of 10 minutes or less [can you tell I am writing this review during MBA Operations class??]  However! This system is perfectly acceptable when you are visiting the Livermore during an off-peak time. The atmosphere is lovely and the decor is appropriate and the bar tenders have seemingly lost their Bar Marco snob attitude in their commute from the Strip District.  Conclusion: Go to this bar for delicious drinks either to start off the night on Fridays and Saturdays or during the weekdays. - Will be returning there myself during that timeframe."}
{"text":"The cocktails are wonderful! The food is definitely not. Most people around us came for drinks and headed elsewhere to eat...and now I know why! The staff is very nice, down to earth and prompt with refills. They clearly don't handle food orders often as evidenced by confusion and several missed dishes. The bruschetta was bread soaked with tomato water, and the risotto with chicken liver was way too irony and the arborio rice was under done. The meatballs were average. The chocolate coffee dessert was quite good. Definitely go for the drinks, but take a short walk somewhere else for dinner!"}
{"text":"As other's have mentioned, when crowded this place is loud. For me this would be a great weeknight drink spot.  On a busy Saturday night service was friendly and adequate, with a solid mixed drink and beer menu."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here to kill some time before heading to an event. The place is small, but has big windows all around so you don't feel cramped in the space. The bar is big and we were able to get a seat easily even with the East Liberty Street Festival going on right outside. The walls are white shiny subway tile and the space is accented with live edge wood shelving behind the bar and a butcher block bar top. We shared an oyster dish that was oysters and bits of potato served on toasted bread. It was so delicious and had a hint of lemony flavor. The only downside is for $8, I would expect to get more than two little pieces of bread. I think 4 would have been more reasonable for that price.  I also ordered a drink. I'm not a big drinker so it doesn't take much to get me tipsy. I ordered the aviation at my friend's suggestion and it was GOOD. I don't like drinks that taste too strong of alcohol. This fit the bill. I was halfway though and already feeling a buzz, which doesn't mean a lot coming from someone like me, but whatevs. The best part was the maraschino cherry on the bottom of the glass. :)  I'm not the \"let's go out for cocktails\" kind of girl, but this place kind of makes me want to be! I don't know if this place would be a good fit for a dinner, but I don't necessarily think that's what they are aiming for anyway...It's a great place to come with friends for maybe lunch/light bites and to share/try a few tapas together."}
{"text":"Came here for a No Menu Monday serving Haitian food to benefit the HAS Haiti. It was basically different variations of rice and beans, but they were very tasty. The featured cocktail was a rum punch that had grapefruit and pineapple in it, and it was very good. The whole meal was very filling. The vibe is pretty classy and is mostly older people, so my 20-something friends and I didn't quite fit the scene, but it was still a fun night."}
{"text":"I go here all the time for happy hour. From 5-6 they have $5 cocktails and half price small plates of delicious Italian food. You really can't beat that. The cocktails are made well and they have just enough on the menu to keep me interested. The food is delicious, and it's not very often that you get food this great with happy hour prices, but there you go."}
{"text":"This place makes some great cocktails, though to be expected, on the pricey side. I do appreciate that there is no tipping, so it all kind of works out. They do use high quality spirits, so their $6 happy hour drinks are a great deal.   I live nearby and always wonder why I don't come here more often. I understand they are trying to focus more on food, but the last time I went for happy hour I was wishing there were more selection of snacks they used to have. I ended up getting their bruschetta, which came on an enormous hunk of focaccia. It was weirdly cut, as it was really tall/thick but had little surface area for the actual bruschetta- which as far as I could tell was just a smear of tomato paste and about four anchovies. Now, I'll eat em, but not a ton. I would rather have had more (any?) fresh tomatoes."}
{"text":"well, i liked the vibe and the cocktails here, but the only bathroom they had was so messy and not well maintained. made me wonder how they're managing the place overall. if not for that, i would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"The drinks we had were fine. It was a bit of a hipster bar/restaurant.   Gratuity was included, but we didn't know it meant the following. We got two drinks, both 10$ each. The bill came and the total was $36. The charge 50% gratuity.   We promptly paid and left.   We won't be back for drinks again."}
{"text":"This review may change, but for now, I have to say I was not wowed whatsoever so I will have to stick with 2 stars.   They were not busy on a Wednesday around 6:30 and we had some time to kill before dinner so we stopped in.  It definitely is a cool little space, aesthetically.  I love the old bowling alley bar and how simple the place is.  However, given the small space, I would be expecting something spectacular from it.  The drink menu is okay, and the food is very minimal. The Old Fashioned that I had gotten was good though.  Pretty yummy which made me happy.    Scotch prices seem a little high for Pittsburgh (a Laphroaig 10 should not be close to $15 in my opinion... maybe $10-12 tops)... and I say this admitting that we tend to spend far more on other Scotches at other establishments when we feel the price is fair.    Service was meh... the girls working did not seem really engaged with any of their customers even though they were not so busy.  They were kind of snobby. Thankfully it was date night with the husband and we did not need to be chatted too.  I would recommend this for a quick drink or small bite before a night out but that is about it right now.  I am sure I will be back soon to give it another try though.  Hopefully then I leave wanting to change my review a bit :)"}
{"text":"The boys from Bar Marco have done it again! We came to the Livermore during their first Monday debut- its  a great spot for after work drinks and snacks.  The menu is small, which I prefer, so, naturally, we ordered everything.  Their boozy depression era cocktails are a hit (helloooo, sazerac!) as are all of the crostinis (my favorite contained anchovie).  I asked the bartender to make me a cocktail off of the menu, using whiskey or rye, and although I had no idea what was going into the concoction, it was certainly delicious.  Looking forward to their expansion next door!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place ever since it opened. I've never had a bad drink here, and I find it fascinating to watch the incredibly hipster staff make them with so much attention to detail. I love the way they serve you a glass of bubbly when you first get in.  I also really enjoy the food - you should definitely consider ordering snacks to go with your cocktails! They rotate the menu so it's hard to keep up but everything has been delicious.  What keeps me from giving it 5 stars? The prices. The price of even standard drinks (e.g. a gin and tonic) is a little high for my liking. I would come here all the time if it were just a tad less expensive! I still come here at least once a month because I just can't resist."}
{"text":"Hot, hot, hot. Not the drinks but the room.   So hot, the water accompanying was lukewarm. By my count 4 bartenders yet only one mixing. Drinks were interesting but not memorable. Quite frankly, it was so uncomfortably hot, we gulped it down and moved on. Unfortunately, not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"We had the oddest and most uninviting experience at Livermore the other night. I honestly wish I had read the recent reviews posted by the others because my experience was similarly disappointing.  The 2 people in our party that arrived first had apparently been asked by the bar staff to move from the middle of the bar to the ends, so as to leave room at the bar to accommodate bigger groups.  (The irony of this unfolds later).  I was the 4th person to arrive, and as I was saying hello, putting my coat away, and essentially getting settled before sitting down at the bar, the staff urged us to take a table for 4 behind us. We declined, saying there were more people joining us. The staff pressed us to take the table again, explaining that they were no longer a cocktail bar, and that there was a strict 'no standing' policy at the bar.  Sensing that this was not going to be a good venue for a big gathering, I made the call that we would finish our round of drinks and food here (since people had already ordered both), and then move on to another place.   So we remained at the bar, but now, aware of and accommodating to the 'no standing' policy, we were seated, waiting for our orders, and mulling our next destination. Then, a fifth friend walked in. While we all stood up to say hello, the bar staff was clearly disturbed and again, asked if we would move to the tiny table for 4 (even though we were now 5 people). I immediately explained to the newcomer that they didn't want us standing around the bar, and I got up and told the group to move to the other side of the bar, where we could all SIT around the corner, and still talk to each other while we waited for our pending orders.   Amazingly, the staff told us we couldn't sit there. To which we incredulously asked, so, you don't want us to stand, but you don't want us to sit? Again, they tried to move us to the 4 person cocktail table, and mumbled something about not wanting a large group to sit at the bar. This - after they had tried to move the first 2 people in our group to the end of the bar so as to be able to accommodate bigger groups at the bar? Truly bizarre! We clearly were unwanted, and this place wasn't worth another ounce of effort. We paid for everything we had ordered (some of which was yet to come out) and left."}
{"text":"I was prematurely wildly enthusiastic about the coming of The Livermore; on edge waiting to have a decent cocktail bar that I can walk to; and more importantly, from.  But my first impression was not so hot. We went on a Friday night, it was fairly busy, but seemingly well staffed. Despite the crowd and lack of seating, we were rapidly greeted and given waters and menus. A seat at the end of the bar soon opened up and we felt golden! So we sat there. And sat there. And wondered who of the three men behind the bar was supposed to serve us. Finally, the same person on the floor who greeted us with water picked up on the fact no one had taken our order (that guy was truly on the ball!).   Drinks: The Manhattan was excellent and reasonably priced. The Almost Home, was fine, but it was $12 and I actually liked the Manhattan better - thus traded with my partner. I'll probably stick with the classics here.   The biggest issue, the only real-harder-to-solve problem, was that the space is extremely loud when full of people yelling over each other, so the atmosphere was jarring. While beautiful, the high ceilings and tiled walls and floors don't help dampen the noise. Not sure if that can be reconciled. I seriously wanted to go around whispering shhhh in people's ears - subtly advising that soft voices can not only be heard, but are alluring. Either way, I will definitely return and hope for a more relaxed crowd."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:30pm on a Saturday for early drinks. Place wasn't crowded, but that quickly changed - place became PACKED at 9:30 as people filtered in. Get there early and snag a table if you can!   Cocktails and specialty drinks are $9 - $14 and range from classic (manhattan and old fashioned) as well as some other favorites (vesper). Bartenders will also craft a specialty drink upon request (I told them \"vodka and not too sweet\" and they delivered!). Cool vibe, cool people and delicious drinks. Not what you'd expect from this area, but the folks from Bar Marco delivered."}
{"text":"I was definitely impressed with the whole atmosphere in the Livermore. Such a lovely way to spend a Saturday night.   The cocktails were amazing and even though we had to wait for nearly 30 minutes (they only had one person to prepare cocktails) it was worth the wait! Staff is super friendly and they really tried to make up for the long wait by pouring some sparkling wine. I like the fact that I don't have to order from the cocktail list but can choose random flavors and they will create a very unique taste over and over again. We also tried a couple of their appetizers and they were delicious!   What I really liked though was the live Jazz band in the back that created this laid back but still fun evening. We couldn't stop dancing and didn't want to leave at all! So, if you're on the look for some fun filled evenings with amazing cocktails and amazing staff, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh and beautiful food that look deceptively simple but are full of flavor because they are simply--fresh. Mostly italian-style food that focus on simplicity and enhancing the flavor of the natural ingredients. Dishes are great for sharing between 2-3 people for variety. I went during happy hour and it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to The Livermore a handful of times now. I have to admit, as mentioned in earlier reviews the rear bathroom area was a horror show, it certainly didn't match the rest of the beautiful bar space. That being said, they have since remodeled the bathroom - yay! The bar tenders are super nice and talented. I've always received great service and well made drinks. I'm pretty picky with my cocktails and The Livermore delivers."}
{"text":"I want to like the Livermore but I just don't. I was so excited as construction began and must say that the bar is absolutely gorgeous. There are giant windows with decent people watching. Beautiful glassware, beautiful food, beautiful decor. But. and here is the but, I find it so uncomfortable! The layout is weird and seating is limited. The giant windows make it feel a bit as if you're in a fish bowl. And the noise- it gets incredibly loud. Also it gets steamy inside- literally the windows will be covered.  I been twice and ordered classic cocktails- manhattan, old fashioned, whiskey sour. I've never been blown away. The drinks I've had were fine but not outstanding. At 10-12$ a pop that was disappointing.   Loved the spicy nuts and potato chips. The potato chips were on the house though because they only had a half order left."}
{"text":"I don't really frequent this neighborhood, but as we left casa rasta, this establishment caught my eye.   We stopped in for a drink just to check it out.   The ambience was trendy but very laid back.    I just had an Italian beer and my friend had a cider, both were good. We didn't get a chance to try the food, but the service was great.   Giuseppe was very knowledgeable about the drinks and even though we just had beers, he clearly knew how to make a good cocktail. He is also very good at engaging his customers.   I definitely will be coming back to try a cocktail and some food. I can see myself becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"What a great place to chill! The Livermore has a totally Italian menu (odd because of the English name) but the desserts were delicious. Keeping with my tradition if desserts first, I was impressed that they were so interesting and simple and delish! I will be going back for dinner!  Walking in the front door was a little confusing but once you realize that it's ok to step into the kitchen to get to the door it made you feel like you were home.  To the left, you walk into a bar that had a San Fran feeling about it. Low lighting, romantic dark chandeliers, old books and bottles of whiskey, wood bars and tables, decorated the room and made it so cozy.  If you sit opposite the bar looking out the window you get a view of the Presby church on Baum which I had no idea was that gorgeous before visiting the Livermore! On to the desserts, I had the goat cheese, lavender, mint panna cotta ....ummmm. yum. I mean panna cotts is every where but these guys can play. The flavor medley, perfect. Next I had the olive oil and polenta cake. It was like grandma's poke cake where they poke holes and drizzle a lemon simple syrup over it. It was truly delish with its fresh whipped cream and crumbled pistachio topping.  All I can say is go. Go now."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here after having dinner at Spoon so I don't know if I felt too full to enjoy the drink I was having or if the drink I was having wasn't that enjoyable.  In either event, I wasn't too fond of the red wine that I had.    Unfortunately I can't even remember which one I chose, but I remember I was looking for more of a Cabernet and what I got was more like a dessert wine.  It was too sweet for my taste and I ended up leaving most of it behind.    Their cocktails looked carefully crafted and tasty.  I tried my friend's and it was STRONG.  I would go here again but would opt for a cocktail next time."}
{"text":"This is an update from the last not so charming review July of last year. I was recommended by my Yelp friend Brian S (what up, B... Lol). It has definitely gotten a lot better. The drinks are still delicious and that casual comfortable vibe is back!   The place was packed when we went but I didn't mind because as soon as we walked in someone greeted us, and found us seats. The drink menu kept me interested. I ordered a delicious gin cocktail which tasted like the nectar of the gods! Unfortunately we just stopped for one drink and couldn't stay longer. When we got the check at first I thought the drinks were pricey but I didn't realize the top was already included in the price of the drink (kinda cool).   Next time I'll have to try some of the snacks and sit at the bar and mingle. Happy that they lasted that period of uncertainty..."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh cocktail scene take 2.  Hey, I had a really nice time here. The printed menu is extremely limited. This is a great thing. I am a pro focus, anti-roadmap menu kind of patron. The drinks I had were quite lovely; Don (pronounced DAW-NEEEEE) made me a rediculoso scotch cocktail that I fell deeply in love with, despite my lengthy tenure marriage to beer.   I also ordered a Fernet and coke because I am a tool and just couldn't resist. El Doñero (pronounced DAW-NEEEE-AIR-O) me preparado un fernet y coca cola mexicana. Me gusta.   Go check this place out."}
{"text":"Went here tonight after anniversary dinner in the neighborhood.  (First time in this part of Pittsburgh!)   What a great place!!! Interesting, cool location, great drink menu, and LG and Justin were just awesome!  Knew their drinks and their neighborhood!!!!   Wish I knew how to say enough nice things - will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Some of my girlfriends and I met up at The Livermore for an early evening girl's night and drinks. I was excited to try the restaurant since I had never been there before. Unfortunately, my actual experience did not meet my expectations.  My first friend to arrive requested to sit in the back lounge area with all the large, comfy sofas. It would have been perfect for all of us to hang out there, but unfortunately she was told that the room was an event space and that we couldn't sit there. When I walked through to use the restroom later in the evening, only two guys were sitting on the couches, glued to their smart phones, so it would have been nice if The Livermore had been more accommodating to us. Instead, we were packed around a small bar height table sitting on uncomfortable bar stools.  In addition to our table not being the most comfortable place, the temperature in the restaurant was almost unbearable. I was wearing a lightweight, sleeveless t-shirt-style dress and was still so warm that sweat was running down my legs. There must have either been an issue with the air conditioning, or the restaurant doesn't have central a/c.   I started with a cocktail called something-something Paris (I can't remember exactly!) that was a vodka based drink paired with fresh and fruity sounding ingredients. It should have been a delicious concoction, but a very strong floral flavor completely overpowered the drink. I then ordered the Bruschetta. It was a small portion consisting of four small slices of bread on a small plate topped with a tomato and two anchovies on each slice. Once again, the very strong taste of the anchovies dominated the other components. Finally, for my second cocktail, I tried Down Pueblo Road. The cocktail's flavor was very smoky - either from the mezcal or from the cynar, a pungent, bittersweet herbal liqueur, which I had never heard of before - and I didn't get any of the ginger and lemon ingredients. Every single item that I tried at The Livermore had one ingredient so strong that it dominated the entire recipe.  I almost fell off my chair when the check arrived. $40 for two meh cocktails and four slices of bread?! Though I think that the concept of paying their employees a living wage is a great idea, the cost of my bill definitely didn't reflect my dining experience.   Even though I still had a nice time with friends, this restaurant didn't hit the mark for me. I don't plan to return here any time soon."}
{"text":"There's a special place in my heart for The Livermore. Known for its deliciously creative libations and subdued atmosphere, The Livermore is a great spot for drinks whenever you get that \"I need a drink\" feeling. Located in the heart of Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood, The Livermore attracts a diverse crowd, but generally millenials that don't mind spending $10+ on a crafted drink. The liquor selection is diverse and (for the most part) the bartenders are well versed in making anything your heart desires. Tell them a color and a scent and they'll often make you something that's pretty spot on. I'd feel better if I were able to give 3 1/2 stars because I've notice a huge shift (a negative shift) in the skills and professionalism of some new bartenders. Colin, a former bartender, and another or two have left and have been replaced by not so great individuals. Allie (blonde) remains and is super awesome, friendly and makes stellar drinks. Livermore, can you please clone Allie and lose some of the newbies? I'll continue to go here and take my out of town guests, but I really hope some of the bartenders improve their professionalism behind the counter."}
{"text":"This place has grown on me. It's still not our go-to cocktails spot, but we don't shy away from stopping in if we're heading to dinner nearby. It's not the type of place that I can see spending the entirety of an evening, and we've rarely stuck around for more than one drink, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.   The bartenders have always been nice, the atmosphere is welcoming, and their Old Fashioned is solid. They have a very small whiskey selection, and it seemed a little expensive the one time I was drinking straight whiskey, so I'd probably stick with the cocktails if you go.  If you need a little base for your alcohol, the cheese plate is really good, as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Continues to impress! Great atmosphere. Unique drinks and the bartenders are great at helping you find a drink to your taste, which is especially helpful for someone like me who doesn't particularly like the taste of liquor. Food is tasty as well. The panini and anchovies on toast are items you don't see many places."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in a renovated older building with stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and wooden furniture, which feels like a traditional cocktail bar. It definitely has a hipster feel to it, and most of the servers and bartenders give off that vibe.  I've enjoyed all the cocktails they've had here, which include some more traditional as well as some more modern spins on things. They do have a few snack options but it is quite limited.  What I've tried has been good but they are just super small snack size portions.  I hope they end up expanding their menu a bit.  Originally I heard people rave about the deviled eggs but they don't seem to offer them anymore and I never got to try them.  They seem to be working on an expansion in the back room so maybe they have some bigger plans.  The service has always been friendly and efficient and this place has a nice low key vibe to it."}
{"text":"No soda water? This place used to be great now they have lower end alcohol and mediocre drinks. Stop posing as Italian, be who you were born to be!"}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks with a friend at the end of the summer. It was still early in the evening so it was less than a quarter full, but I was okay with that because I am slowly turning into a grandma.   Being that the bar is in East Liberty, I was expecting East Liberty prices and was thoroughly miffed to find most cocktails in the $10-$12 range. I opted for $5 beers (they had a good pumpkin selection at the time) instead and had a good time. I wouldn't say that this is a destination spot, but easily somewhere you could pop in when you're in between things. Would give it another try, but by no means am I sold on making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Happy hour cocktails are great. Love that this place pays its servers and bartenders a living wage so no tipping allowed! Don't miss \"In-laws on a rampage\"--amazing drink!!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to give this place a great rating bc I was really excited about it. Unfortunately, I've been waiting 30 minutes for a drink so far and it's still counting. I totally understand that these drinks are super involved to make. However, they are woefully underprepared for a busy Saturday night. With a bar packed to the brim and a live show next door, they have only two bar tenders working the entire place. It took me at least 15 minutes to even get looked at by the bartender and after I gave her my order, she was so busy doing other orders and drinks that after another 15 minutes she had forgotten my order.   Update: after another 10 minutes I have gotten my drink. They are delicious drinks. However this place needs WAY better management and more bartenders.   I really wish I could give more stars bc this place reminds me of my favorite places in DC. But alas, 40 min is too long to wait for a drink."}
{"text":"This could have been a 3-star review. 1 star for how beautiful the venue was when it was lowly lit by candlelight and dimmed bulbs overhead.  The food was good but not exceptional. Minus 2 stars for the bartender being a prick. I don't get to go out as often as I used to but my tolerance has been carefully crafted over the years to reflect a level of maturity as well as class. I also don't take well to being spoken down to especially when I haven't done anything to instigate oh - and not to mention, I was a paying customer.   As I ordered my third drink the bartender stared at me and didn't respond. I repeated my order in case he didn't hear me and he said, \"Oh I heard you, I just don't feel like cleaning vomit up off the bathroom floor again tonight.\" Again? This was my first time here. I had only had two drinks and who does he think he is questioning my judgment? Seeing the look on my face my husband asked if he had a problem with us and the bartender throws his hands up and says \"I was just trying to help\" and turned his back. We left and will never return. There are PLENTY of other places where I won't be met with insult, attitude and prejudice."}
{"text":"The building sits on the corner of Baum Blvd and Highland Ave with the address being on Highland Ave.  This building houses the restaurant portion and the Cloakroom (the event portion).  The only place I saw \"Livermore\" anywhere was above the Highland Ave. entrance that I've read in others' reviews is not accessible.  Weird.  This is a small restaurant but looks inviting and warm.  The menu has few options, but more than the Cloakroom side.  They are Italian options I learn quickly and the menu has lots of Italian wording and Italian wines listed.  I had to ask about ingredients and wines.  I'm ok with that but it caused me to expect a higher level than what was delivered both in presentation an quality of taste.  We ordered and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, we ask when our food might be ready.  We're told \"2 minutes\".  That appeared to be code for \"Oh, shoot; we forgot so tell 'em 2 minutes and it'll be ready in 10\".  It seemed that way.    Food arrived in 2 large white bowls.  When I see that I immediately think \"microwave\".  May or may not be true but the food could easily have been.  Mine was a pasta with red sauce, cheese, (and pesto and sausage but I wouldn't have known that except it was listed on the menu).  It was meh -- bland and so average for a dish that I had to ask what a word was on the ingredient list only to be told it was a cheese.  Not impressed with looks or taste.  When I order a pesto dish it's because of the pesto.  And pesto is not usually buried in red sauce.  My husband ordered risotto with liver, mushrooms.  He said his stomach was upset by all the pepper they used.  When our host asked us how we liked our dished, we were honest.  She did graciously offer to take care of our bill so she might have taken something off it.  I wasn't paying attention as my husband paid.  If the dish is going to be so average, then use English words and ingredients; otherwise, do the dishes some justice with eye-catching appeal and taste.  And, don't take so long in the kitchen.  Note that the same kitchen is shared between the restaurant side and the Cloakroom side.  On the positive side, they don't accept gratuities according to their menu notes; their staff is paid a salary."}
{"text":"The Livermore is fucking great. Certainly gets packed on the busy nights, but that's what I want on a Friday. Weekdays are much more relaxed, and it's an awesome place to meet someone for conversation. The food is killer, lots of rich and salty food to go with awesome cocktails. Don't stick to stuff you're comfortable with, talk to the Bartenders, they're super cool. Tell them what you like and they'll pretty much always make you something you've not had before that you're gonna want again.  Plus, if you don't wanna spend a bunch, there's always their 3 dollar beers, which is pretty nifty in a space like that."}
{"text":"I love our neighborhood and all the businesses that help to support it, but unfortunately sometimes a spot or two just isn't for me.  This is definitely the case with Livermore. I can be \"frugal\"  (to put it lightly) so when they don't use the quality to constitute the price of their drinks, I get a little miffed. The \"menu\" is classic cocktails that you shouldn't need a menu for. Worst of all, the service here only gets worse the longer they've been open. I have also had that terrible bar experience where they charged me for everyone else's drinks, fixed the bill, charged me the correct amount and then never refunded the original amount. They even denied the claim when I tried to dispute it with my bank.  Granted, I'm sure this is a very isolated incident, but geez.  On a very personal level, I don't like the \"cooler than cool\", born in the wrong century type (think dream of the 1890s) establishments in my area, and this one takes the prize on that.  It really is a shame since this bar is right across the street. Most I know (especially in our East End area) disagree, as almost everyone else seems to like it enough.  I'd rather take the little hike up to Ellsworth or down Penn. Really, if you are like those I know and are into frou frou hip places, you would love this.  But honestly, it's way too much unless you're really hankering for a $10 sub par Manhattan or a \"spiced nuts\" bowl."}
{"text":"Wow! I rarely write a review, but I feel compelled to do so after tonight.  My partner and I shared 3 incredible cocktails, a shrimp cocktail and an amazing white fish pate. $52 with tip. Worth every penny and 5 stars. Then I got up to use the ladies room. This was when the horror movie began. I'm not making this up.   To the rear is a single door, I walked through to see the door and all the drywall missing exposing a toilet and sink to the world. I really had to pee but it wasn't going to happen here. I continued on. I saw a man coming up from the basement, he told me there were two restrooms down there. One to the left, preferred, and one not preferred to the right.   To the right was a door with a sigh saying Shadow Lounge, it was ajar. I went to the preferred left and found a tightly locked door with a deadbolt key lock and a sigh for what I believe was a tuxedo rental store. I really have to pee now. I go back to the door marked Shadow Lounge.   I enter, a toilet. Yuck! It is not flushed and it will not flush. I'm desperate. I hover, I'll wipe up the seat after. Oh no! No paper!  Upon arriving upstairs my partner had paid our bill. I left immediately and will not return. There is no excuse for what happened here.  They should change their name to the a Twilight Zone. I'm giving this place 1 star only because it won't post with none. The finest food and drink in the world was not worth what I experienced."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I went to The Livermore in the early days, I found the bartenders to be friendly and interested in talking about the cocktails and how they're made. Good experience then.   The last 2 times in recent months I went to the Livermore, however, the bartenders seemed to be aloof hipsters who made it seem like they were doing you a favor by taking your order, making your drink and delivering it.  Admittedly, I was not sporting a Boy Scout shirt, a trucker's hat or interesting facial hair so this may have colored my reception.  The last time we went there, we were greeted with social indifference and my fiancee got a 3 ounce (no exaggeration) pour of a $12 glass of wine and I ordered an Old Fashioned ($14).  The bartender, in front of me, poured about a half ounce of one rye whiskey (Dickel) then threw out the bottle and finished the drink with a different bottle of rye whiskey (Rittenhouse).  When I confronted him about this he said \"Well, I ran out of the first one so I finished with a different one.  It will still be a good drink, man\".  No further explanation or apology and when we got the check, no monetary acknowledgement/apology either.    I don't know how much of this has to do with the lack of incentive generated by the no gratuity policy, but I do know that I will never go back to this establishment and I will advise any of my friends who value quality drinks, a relaxed customer-driven atmosphere, and a bare minimum of respect from their servers to look elsewhere. I think the management needs to clean house."}
{"text":"Small plates, great cocktails, just the right balance of busy but not crowded on the three occasions I have been there recently. It is unintentionally turning into one of my East End spots to go where I want a little more upscale than my normal haunts, but without being too spendy or sit-down.    It's a great spot for two, maybe three, though I would suggest looking elsewhere if your group is larger.  The bartenders are great, tell them what you like and let them come up with a cocktail just for you.  Half price oysters during happy hour don't hurt either."}
{"text":"WOW. So...they messed up everyone's orders, they were pretty much out of everything, and when our orders did eventually arrive, they were just ok. Points for serving food late and being open, and extra points for being so totally disorganized that we were only charged for half of what we ordered, if I knew that were the deal going in, I would have been much more cool with the lack of everything."}
{"text":"Attended a event, nice intimate private space for gatherings. The wine and spirits were good, and if they don't have what you desire, the staff will happily create something for you."}
{"text":"My friends and I went last night. The bartender was really nice, the food was good, the drinks were better! I liked the atmosphere of the place. It was fairly warm out, so the door was open, letting in fresh air, and it was kind of dim in there so it felt very warm and intimate.  I had the brussel sprout salad. Nomz. And also shells and cheese. The shells and cheese were kind of really greasy and salty but good.  I'll definitely come here again for some cocktails! Yay!"}
{"text":"Loved the interior decor and the service.  When you arrive the waiter gives you water and a little cup of sparkling rose. What a lovely touch!  Made us feel very welcome and was a great palette cleanser.  The cocktails were yummy and our waiter helped us decide by having us answer a series of questions which was fun! Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"What happened?!  No longer a cocktail bar.  Wines and tapas.  So bummed.  Slogging onwards."}
{"text":"I attended a birthday party held in the back room. There was a special birthday drink list for us to order from. The red wine was very good but it's so hard for me to justify $10 for 6 ounces. My friend and I went to the main bar up front to see if perhaps the party prices were a bit higher? But it was in fact the opposite!   I did like the ambiance of the front section a lot. Very rustic, warm, and hip. I also enjoyed the spacious back area and comfy couches. Although I will probably only ever go back here during happy hour.   Nothing else very memorable stuck out for me. Nothing negative though, either, so that's good."}
{"text":"BACON-WRAPPED DATES. Salty, sweet, and oh so good.  The cocktails, based on the classics, are decent, but overpriced at $10-$12. The place gets quite busy on the weekends, and it's a pretty small space to begin with. The weekend crowd definitely seems to lean hipster, which may or may not be a bad thing. Besides the pork rillettes, which was just okay, I haven't tried their other food items. But, really, who needs to when you have bacon-wrapped dates?"}
{"text":"Went to The Livermore on a date night. Perfect place for a few cocktails. Everything we ordered was delicious, fresh, and expertly prepared. Prices seem high but you get what you pay for. The drinks were high quality and the staff doesn't accept tips; they are already payed a living wage. Not only are their drinks laudable but so are their business practices. This shows in their staff. Everyone was beyond friendly and very knowledgable about their menu. Will go again. But next time I go I'd like to try some of the snacks!"}
{"text":"There were dark times at Livermore. Those times seem to be coming to an end. Management has been reverting bad decisions made.  The front door is open again. The snooty host asking for your reservation is gone. You can sit down on a Tuesday or Wed and have a conversation with the bar manager again, and learn about cocktails and liquors.  Welcome back, beloved neighborhood bar!  That last remaining star is for the food - I need to try it again. The last experience we had was not so good, and portions were a bit small for dinner, and too expensive to be a snack. I do wish they had some cheap bar snacks like they used to - nuts, bread."}
{"text":"I was a pretty regular visitor here for over a year, stopping in probably close to once a week on average (usually to grab a post-dinner cocktail with a friend). It was one of the first places I would take any friends from out of town; the drinks were excellent, the vibe was relaxed, and they seriously had the best bar staff. There were several regular bartenders who were always super friendly, informative, and seemed to actually care that their patrons were enjoying themselves and their drinks.  Shortly before one of my best friends moved out of the city, we made it a point to stop in. We found that the Highland Ave. entrance was locked, which was odd. We were redirected to the small entrance around the side, and knew something was up. Upon entering, we were greeted by a hostess and informed that there had been \"some changes\" and that they were now a full-service restaurant. We asked if we could just sit at the bar and order a cocktail, and were told with snarky attitude that that probably wouldn't be possible without a reservation. She did disappear behind the weird thick curtain that now hid the main room and returned to tell us that she could \"probably\" squeeze us into one of the corners. In the meantime we had glanced over the menu only to find that the cocktail list was reduced to less than five lackluster choices. This, combined with the weird interaction that had occurred, caused us to decline her offer and leave to find a drink elsewhere.   Now, I'm not lowering my rating so severely due to a change in concept. Change can be good, and obviously the owners can do whatever they want--it's their place, after all. My intention is not to whine just because I happened to like the way it was before. I can't say I understand it though, considering this place seemed super successful (the few times I went late on a Friday or Saturday, it was packed). Also, it doesn't seem to make sense as a restaurant. There are about four tables; the rest is all bar counters.   Pittsburgh Magazine posted an article in early June announcing the changes. The article also suggested that the staff (who, as I mentioned, were part of the reason we loved this place) were not given advance notice of the changes, and that the majority moved on or were let go. That was unfortunate to hear. And everything I have heard just sounds shady.   I posted a link to that article on Twitter to show some other friends who enjoyed going here, and in turn I was literally blocked by the Livermore. Bizarre, right? I started to look around on Twitter, and found that a few others had posted the article. In one case, the Livermore (publicly) referred to one of the people who posted it as a \"f*cktard\" which is a really curious approach to PR. Sorry, but I can't support that kind of business.  Maybe it's not fair to give one star considering we didn't even stay long enough to try the food. But I feel it was certainly earned through these bizarre experiences. The food could be amazing, but unfortunately I have no intention of trying it and supporting this or Bar Marco, given the circumstances."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I had a nice experience. I want to get back but there are so many places and so little time. I will say that the $9 Julep is superb! A girl only needs two I tell you. I like the interior a lot as well. Several places on that block seem to work well together with regard to style and design."}
{"text":"First time I came here was when they first opened. I have to admit, I had a so so cocktail, was kinda bummed about it, and didn't make this a destination spot again.  Well, now I find myself in the hood again, and I figure why not, give it another go round! I'm happy to report I'm very impressed. The last time I went the staff was a bit short with me, this time they were super friendly and helpful. My drink, a negroni, was wonderful!  We also opted to try the mussels. They were served chilled on crostini with potatoes and obviously marinated in vinegar. They were scrumptious! Seriously, so good. It was such a tease, because it was such a small dish. Since it was only two crostini's, and I split it with my friend, one crostini was just not enough! So beware, if you're greedy, get one for yourself:)  I'm more than happy to come back now, especially to try more food! I'll be interested to see if they ever expand their menu, because it's small. We'll see, because I'll check in again soon!"}
{"text":"We're so sad they're closing. We absolutely love this place, their cocktails and the staff! We'll miss our go-to bar :("}
{"text":"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!  When this spot opened a few years ago it was super edgy. The back was a cool concert space and the bar was speakeasy themed. Constantly packed on Friday nights it was a warm social oasis to the winter weather. I'm glad to see the new management staff has been able to resurrect this perfectly placed gem. The drinks are strong, the meatballs are delightful. After you have tried all of the appetizers on the menu, walk out the front, and gloat in the fact that you are conveniently buzzed and in middle of some of the best new eateries in town. NEW DEVELOPMENT! they have converted the back room into a coffee shop and brunch pop up!!! Advice, stay open minded. They are still figuring it out as far as the dance club to brunch club transition goes. The food is snack sized and delicious. The drinks are fantastic of course! The coffee is wonderful. Advice is wait it out or go and know they are still forking out the kinks. Have faith! East lib is about to give birth to a wonderful Sunday hang out spot!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely welcoming and knowledgeable staff! Nice atmosphere as well.   We arrived early, so we had the whole place to ourselves for a while. The staff was very friendly in assisting us with our decisions."}
