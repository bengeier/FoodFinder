{"text":"A great place for breakfast or lunch! The crepes are super tasty (they're all savoury, filled with eggs, meat, and crispy veggies) and very filling. The meat filling and batter are both made by the owners, so they taste great and you can be assured it's real, good quality food. Also, did I mention free coffee? :D

The restaurant is very clean and their decor is warm and modern. Plus, the two shop owners are both super nice! They can speak both Chinese and English, so there's not gonna be a language problem, and they made sure we had everything we needed.

Overall, a great place to pick up some breakfast, brunch, or lunch! I would recommend the beef crepe/wrap (it's a bit of both, really)."}
{"text":"I had the beef jian bing. The taste was so great. People are nice there ! Wonderful place to have a breakfast. The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Finally! This is the best Bing that I ever had in Toronto! Fair price for the food and the decoration is good."}
{"text":"This place opened up 2 weeks ago.

Went here for lunch today.   Firstly, the staff is very welcoming and the place is a friendly atmosphere (lots of smiles).  Would have liked some background music if i was to change anything. 

Tried the Bing and the jian bing.   Had a beef Bing family size which was very affordable $14.99.  After we shared that between 3 people which is more than enough, we tried the chicken jian bing.  This was tasty as well.  Food here is very fresh and made to order.   It looks like they are trying new items coming from time to time with a cheese cake now being offered.  Unfortunately we were to full to try this.  It will have to wait till next time.

For the bing although it was tasty as is, i would love if i could add cheese or have some kind of dipping sauce.


Would definately go again.   I have some more menu items to go to, and this is definately a nice spot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. 
Found out about this place through a BOGO coupon using Entertainment (https://shop.entertainment.com/?gclid=CP6NlKaq7dICFQ4oaQodfosAuQ). 

Restaurant is clean and tidy; decor is old-fashioned.  

Ordered Chicken and Beef Jian Bing.  It is similar to a crepe, with the added flavour and texture.  It is lined with eggs and a crunchy strip of fried wonton, and is layered with hoisin and chili sauce (optional). This was made fresh to order. 

I would recommend coming here for lunch/snack instead of dinner."}
{"text":"place is CLOSED!!!

Braved an ice storm for nothing. It's now some lounge. RIP BING-GO. Wanted to try you but never got to do so"}
{"text":"the smell as soon as you walk in makes you hungry
the service is fantastic, very polite and courteous
i ordered a beef bing.
it does take 10-15 minutes to make, which the server did advise so i was prepared for the wait.
the beef bing was served piping hot. and even in the cold brisk weather, still takes some time to cool down. interested in trying some other items on the menu, maybe with veggies. i think it would have tasted really good with a slice of cheese in it and it melts in with the meat."}
{"text":"This is my first time having a Jian Bing (??)! I've always seen it at T&T but never had a chance to try. We found this obscure little place at the northwest corner of 16th and Markham. I got the pork wrap and the hubster got the beef wrap. They were made to order and were so fresh and tasty! I wish more people knew about this place since it doesn't seem to get as much credit as it deserves. Go pay it a visit if you're ever in East Markham!"}
