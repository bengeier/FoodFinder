{"text":"We have been going to the Gilbert location for quite a while now. When we heard that they were opening a restaurant in Chandler we couldn't wait to try it!! And trust me, it didn't disappoint! My husband had the Flank steak, it was cooked perfectly. I had one of their special, the Filet Rossini, probably one of the best filet I have ever tried. 
I decided to try their special drink of the night, The Espresso Martini, it was very good!
We will be back for sure, for the food and the ambiance!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Nice atmosphere.  Food hit the spot.  Duck filet was very good.  Martinis were over the top."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in Chandler.  Wonderful service, atmosphere and huge portions of delightful food.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

Best kept secret!!!"}
{"text":"Can we rate 6 stars instead of 5? Parking, not a problem. Convenient mall location, huge parking lot. Everything about this place is right. Food, service, atmosphere, awesome heated patio, wine selection.... The best fish soup, the best Veal chop we have ever had. Everything is good. Service is always spot on, Killian and his team are hospitality masters. Fabrice food always delicious. Stop reading, just go there and you will want to go back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly staff and owners.  Went with 3 adults and 2 kids for New Years, and they offered a couple of kid-friendly dinner options that weren't on the special NYE menu.  Great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  I have been in restaurants for years - including a stint as the front end/beverage manager for a French restaurant in Columbus, OH.  Service here is personable and comfortable.  You can walk in for an annual anniversary dinner and have a outstanding experience or you can make a quick stop at the bar and an appetizer and drink.  The food is authetintic and prepared with attention to detail.  Best for last: the wine list. French wine shines.  It is affordable and amazing."}
{"text":"Sorry we can't agree with the 5-star reviewers.  We had high hopes and expectations but that just didn't materialize.  The beautiful decor is that of the previous restaurants in the space, namely Earnest and Cork, respectively.  We don't drink wine, so we can only comment on the food.  We started with a bruschetta board, which was quite good.  My wife had the pork which was drowned in sauce while I had the rib-eye, which was the thinnest rib-eye I have ever been served anywhere...and tasteless even with the butter topping.  The potatoes on both plates were also quite good but our rating is based on our disappointment with the meat portion of our entrees.

Reading the background of the new owners, we expected classically prepared French dinners but that wasn't the case.  At the price points they're charging, they're going to have to inventory and sell a lot of wine to make a go of it in what has become a poor location for all restaurants and retail businesses.  

The service was excellent but that alone isn't enough for us to go back to C&WB."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and wine list! The Rosè- Whispering Angel is great if you are dinning out on the patio( or even if you aren't!) It tastes perfect on a hot summer day! Any of the charcuterie boards are excellent to share-- but especially the mixed board! It's perfect. ;) service is attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Blown away by how great this restaurant is.  It's a hidden gem in Chandler and I'm seriously mad at myself for not finding it sooner.  The wine selection is superb, and our server Killian was very informative on various French wines.  Our wine, appetizers, dinner, dessert, and cappuccino were all 5 stars. We cannot wait to come back to try the rest of the menu and the specials. There is no need to drive to Scottsdale for amazing French cuisine and wine. The best in the Valley is right here in Chandler.  Make sure you try the escargot!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was fantastic! Cocktails amazing food delicious and service was really good. The four stars due to the size of the plates pretty small but again delicious and ok if you aren't a huge Plate kind of person! Highly recommend it.
If there were half stars I would give 4.5!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful ambiance and attention to detail. Food was delicious as well!  It's apparent that Fabrice and his wife take great pride in what they do. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"To start, the host that greeted us had a big yawn!  I mean a big and long yawn.  Our table was by the kitchen and the air was blowing so hard my hair was all over the place.  I moved so I could look out the window (instead of the kitchen) and they were filthy.  I get it, we are inAZ but when you are paying for a more high end meal, I would like the atmosphere to CLEAN and high end too. The cheese board was good.  The steak didn't have much flavor. Their fries were the best part of the meal.  The chocolate soufflé was over baked.  The server seemed overwhelmed and she gave us the wrong check.  I was looking for a more relaxing and upscale experience but we could have gone to Outback and had the same experience.  Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I am sad to be giving Cuisine and Wine Chandler only two stars.  The two stars are only for the classy interior and mediocre service.  The food didn't pass the two star threshold.  My beignets arrived looking like they had been deep fried twice and almost burnt.  Both  salads arrived  lifeless and doused in a tasteless dressing that was weighed down on the oil.  Sorry but it will take something fierce to get me to return."}
{"text":"Amazing, romantic atmosphere. Go for the Entrecôte grillée beurre maitre d'hotel.

That is all...."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and well thought out/balanced flavors. Staff was very helpful in choosing an entrée. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent for wine and apps! We went at 7 on a Saturday and surprisingly there was no wait, which was awesome. 

We had wine, caprese salad, and bruschetta. All fantastic. The caprese salad comes plated in the coolest way, check out photos to see it, I'm obsessed. The bruschetta was 3 for $11. We got a pesto, blue cheese one, a prosciutto one, and a Brie fig walnut one. My favorite was actually the pesto even though I don't like blue cheese! 

The menu was a little limited, but if the entrees are  as good as the apps then I'll be back for sure. 

Very romantic and jazzy. Great for date night."}
{"text":"Wow. I think we found a new dinner spot!. This place is only few months old m(I believe) and it's very clean and inviting. The Chefs Son was our waiter & he was adorable,TALL & French! He knows his wine and was accommodating. For appetizers we had a Caprese Salad  (enough to share for two) 
Ribeye and Salmon for our entrees. 
Great restaurant. We will be going back! 

The chef is very serious about his presentation, so there was no salt or pepper on the table to ruin his creations. Trust me. You don't need it anyway. 

There's also a outdoor seating with a fireplace"}
{"text":"Went here with friends for my bday - great food, great service, great atmosphere. Couldn't be happier. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My kids and I enjoyed dinner here though it's not necessarily a restaurant that you would want to bring your kids along to try. The ambiance is dim and romantic. The service was great. All the staff were helpful and friendly. 
The wine selection was good and I enjoyed my rose wine.
We ordered 3 kinds of bruschetta ($11) and they were all tasty. I especially liked the blue cheese pesto bruschetta.
Dinner portions were larger than I expected for serving French cuisine. The quiche Lorraine was to die for and the ratatouille with pork was on point. We also ordered croquettes and they were delicious as well.
This place was great. Support local!"}
{"text":"Wow! Is all I can say. After frequenting all the trendy restaurants in the east valley for work meetings, this Chandler gem beats the pants off every single one of the overpriced and over-pretentious Scottsdale/Arcadia/and \"you're lucky to eat here\" type restaurants that one would expect. Except, this is the most authentic French cuisine family owned business with the best wine list I've seen since our travels in Rome and Tuscany. The Bordeaux is amazing and all of the meals are expertly prepared. If you want a true family feel restaurant, awesome atmosphere and the highest quality food/drink, check this place out. I'm mad at myself that I've lived less than 10 min away for the past 3 years and just discovered it."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  I'm new to the area and this place is a definite on my list to go back."}
{"text":"Wonderfully prepared \"Country French\" offerings in a delightfully relaxed and comfortable setting. My wife and I enjoyed Valentines Day Dinner here and we still marvel at the wonderful flavors and beautiful presentation. My wife had the Filet Mignon and I the Veal Chop; both done to perfection. We both had the Lobster tail in a dipping sauce soup with crusty, cheese toasted French Bread. We still talk about the flavors that danced in our mouths. Delightful!

Would have been Five Stars but for the service: disorganized and a bit slow and chaotic. Where cuisine is paramount, such distractions should be eliminated. Waiting staff should be well versed in the menu and be thoroughly trained in the art of \"invisible\" service.

All-in-all, this is the best French Restaurant I've eaten in in many years. We willl be back."}
{"text":"Cheese plate.  Quiche Lorraine. Our waiter Chris.  Just 3 things that made our dinner last night a reason to go here again."}
{"text":"Great food! Veal Chop was awesome. Service was top of the line. Get in here and try this place."}
{"text":"We keep coming back. The food here is always excellent. Cheese croquettes to start, crispy, warm and creamy. Then, fried Brie for my wife and croquettes de bouef for me. Both were outstanding. We finished with the souflé du chocolat, which didn't survive our attack. All this during happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been to this Bistro several times and each time both the service and the food was very good.  The last visit I wanted to try something different and so tried the Wild Boar. It was tough and didn't have much flavor. I tasted my friend's lamb chops and they were excellent.  Next time I will try the lamb. Overall, a great nice restaurant in Chandler which has been needing one for some time."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by my neighborhood group so my expectation was high. Sadly, I did not find this to be an exceptional restaurant. Both my and my husband's filet was ordered medium and both came out so well done it was like chewing leather. The twice baked potato was burnt to a crisp at the bottom as well.The drinks are so overpriced too.  Luckily our out of town friend's meals were ok but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fantastic dinner at Cuisine and Wine Bistro.   We highly recommend this family owned and operated friendly restaurant.   Delicious hand cut steaks, fantastic escargot, roasted salmon, special salads,  chocolate soufflé and creme brûlée with Grand Marnier glaze to die for... plus much more to choose from.    Great wine selection!   Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We are big \"foodies\" and it has amazing food & generous portions for very affordable prices! It's not your ordinary everyday menu. Many great choices!! Great for every kind of appetite! You can eat very healthy here or not. I had the best salmon salad ever! It's a big portion! I get it every time and always consistent. Super filling! Worth every penny!! My BF had the meat/cheese board! Took a pic. It was outrageously generous! Inc a small salad & a stack of fresh toasted bread w amazing jam & walnuts. Words don't do this place justice! You MUST go!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Can't complain about any of their food! Great family-owned restaurant that cares about customer service. Chandler is lucky to have them for their 2nd restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service is personable but not intrusive; wine list superb and food divinely French --except the portions are USA grade A large. We are particularly fond of Wednesday half price bottles of wine paired with a salad--the goat cheese salad my favorite! A great addition to the Fulton Ranch neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy Cuisine and Wine bistro is here in Chandler! I had the chance to try several items on the menu upon frequent visits. The bruschetta is great! The fig and Brie was my favorite. The French onion soup is delicious! Savory with the perfect amount of spice. The croquettes ( chorizo and fromage ) were yummy. Salmon quiche had a nice flavor. I loved the Mixed board the best! Happy hour was very lovely as we didn't feel rushed and it gave us time to sample many plates. All that was missing was the escargot, hope they offer this soon. Last but not least, the chocolate soufflé.. I have no negative reviews, I love French Cuisine and will certainly be a frequent patron."}
{"text":"Wow! We really enjoyed this restaurant and experience. Great service, incredible food (I understand the chef trained in France) and an impressive wine selection. We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest selection of wine in Chandler, you can find wines from all over the world. 
Family owned and operated, the atmosphere and ambiance is just amazing at this location. The food is always delicious, a little taste from France. If you are looking for French cuisine, this is definitely the best to visit. Start with their Escargots, get a Filet de Boeuf for the main course and of course, the chocolate soufflé as a dessert. They have a great dessert wine list as well.
What makes it so special is that they have specials starter, main courses or desserts every day so you can always try something new."}
{"text":"Grand opening!
What a great moment with my friends, I loved the atmosphere and the staff.
The food was great (we had the bruschetta and the quiche Lorraine)
Nice selection of wine, it's really nice that they opened a second location.
Will definitely come back here !"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to stay local in Chandler. I made a 7:30 Saturday reservations on the web site. Located in a strip mall and knowing that this restaurant location/address has been 2 other restaurants. I was thrilled that my favorite cuisine was being served here \"French\", finally in Chandler!

Upon arrival we were seated and our server Collin introduced himself. We ordered cocktails while perusing the menu. The menu selections were \"French\" down to the Frog Leg item. Of course we ordered our classic favorite the Escargot. Entree choices were the special Veal Chop and Duck Filet with a Green Peppercorn Sauce. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised the food preparation, presentation and taste all were excellent.

Cuisine & Wine is definitely a neighborhood gem, while the food was excellent, we felt the flow of service was slightly off. The restaurant was not overly crowded, but cocktails were delayed even after the 3rd. round, though we were compensated for a round. After the appetizer was served and we were finishing up, our server then asked us if we wanted our main entree started. Odd question, so there was a wait then for our entrees. Nothing earth shattering, just a little off between the bar and kitchen flow and the flow drink and food delivery.

Atmosphere: modern, nice, Service: good, Food: excellent. Also note the Soufflé au Chocolat amazing, We will be definitely back for more French."}
{"text":"We went early after a long week of work. What a find.great food and knowledgeable service. We had really good wine and then dug in  for food.
We went through two appetizers,a bruschetta board before ordering an amazing quiche Lorraine. Somehow we had room for dessert which we were glad we did. Had the chocolate soufflé which was great.
Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"wonderful French bistro.  everything was excellent.  nice indoor atmosphere.  plenty of room between tables.  happy hour menu too.  can't wait to return"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! It was designed very well. Super amazing wine storage right when you walk in. The wine menu was extensive. The service was on point! 

My husband and I ordered a few appetizers, starters and two entries. 

Everything was AMAZING! The shrimp was well cooked and seasoned. My husband for the snails and he said they were the best he'd ever had. 
The fish was perfectly grilled and the sauce was so flavorful. 

My husband steak with the glaze was phenomenal. 

Everything came out in order and properly timed. We really were able to enjoy our meal instead of feeling rushed in and out just to fill our stomachs. 

All around great meal, great experience. We recommended it to friends and family as soon as we left and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We went here last Friday night and it was lovely. The drinks were superb and the food was delicious. It is owned by a French family and you can tell they pour their heart and soul into making this place the wonderful place that it is. It is so nice to have a quality place to go just a two minute uber from the house."}
{"text":"Nice place! Ambience was very relaxing and comfortable. I loved the outside patio!

Service was great from the more seasoned staff and owner, but they had some younger servers who weren't really on their game. They forgot things we asked for more than once. 

Food was good but not fabulous. The steak was tough and the mound of fried potatoes was too much and too bland. The French onion soup didn't have enough cheese or body and it had waaaaay too much pepper that overpowered the dish. The salad was good, with lots of different veggies, egg, meat and cheese but the dressing was lackluster.

The duck dish was ok but the meat was Haney and a bit chewy. The sauce was really good though and the twice cooked potato was a standout. The salmon was really plain and had too much lemon juice on it, i think as a coverup that there was no sauce that a chef would have made to prove their skills. 

Creme brûlée was the best part and I'm not really a dessert person.  

Bathrooms and restaurant were clean and there's plenty of parking. Definitely a nice place to find in a strip mall but not worth going out of your way to visit. The taste of the food and the preparation wasn't what I'd expect from a nicer French restaurant. I bet some stuff is better than others and you just have to find your favorites and stick with them!"}
{"text":"While getting a haircut at V's barbershop, my husband found this (newly opened this September) wonderful French restaurant...He was so excited to surprise me. We both loved our first experience...great waiter named Chris welcomed us and the food & presentation were all wonderful. Two beautiful patios with great ambience that open to the inside as well  Holidays are coming...Great gift idea..."}
{"text":"Very good selection of white and red wines, especially the Hartford Chardonnay. The food is top notch as well, offering a good selection of appetizers and main entrees. The location is a bit odd."}
{"text":"The Duck Confidence was very nice with a bottle of CotesDu Rhone. Great little French Gem right in Sun Lakes back yard."}
{"text":"Tried Cuisine & Wine Bistro last night fir the first time with friends. The ambiance was very nice.  But, was a little disappointed in the menu. They offered many difference choices of fish, steak and duck but no chicken choices for those allergic to fish and want a lighter protein.
I ordered a side salad and a French onion soup that was very brothy.  However, my husband ordered the steak, au gratin potatoes and escargot and loved his meal.  The beignet appetizers were amazing!  And of course, we couldn't leave without ordering the creme brulle which was absolutely delicious! 
Overall, we enjoyed a nice meal and had very good service!"}
{"text":"My mom brought me here for my birthday dinner and it was fabulous. Sam our server took good care of us and was very pleasant. A hidden gem in Chandler!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite French spot in Phoenix. The escargot is the best. The staff is superb! This time I had the lamb......not a huge lamb eater but it was restaurant week menu. The asparagus soup was spot on!! As always the creme brûlée was yummy. This time I had a sparkling wine that was great. My favorite dish there is the veal!! Soooooo delicious. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The best place I have been to down here in the East Valley by far. Great flavors, service and atmosphere."}
