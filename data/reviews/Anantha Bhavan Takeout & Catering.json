{"text":"This is a Sri Lankan takeout place, in the heart of Mississauga in a strip mall, the chances were... the food was going to be good (according to Tyler Cowen's ethnic dining tips anyways -http://tinyurl.com/57yfvj ). We had some trouble communicating as not much English was spoken, so didn't quite know what we were ordering or what it was composed of. Most things were vegetarian and we settled on an assortment of items - Puttu, Kothu Roti, fried vada's (fritters made out of lentils and dried chickpeas), and this breaded deep fried roll stuffed with mashed potato and spicy mutton or fish filling.  The Puttu with vegetables was a little bit dry and not very spicy. Depending on the time you visit the store, it can get a bit dry and i suggest asking for extra chutney (the green coconut one is my favourite). What i discovered with this dish is.. if i re-fry it and add some Cajun spices at home, it is the most delicious fusion of flavours(WAY better than the original way its sold)! Since its takeout, this is really easy to do, only around $5 for a large container good for 3 servings.  The Vadas were the same story. A little dry, but good with some saucey chutneys. Re-heat these only in the oven. Two of these suckers will fill you right up.  The Kothu Roti, is pieces of roti, chopped up and thrown together with a type of curry sauce and vegetables. I got the vegetarian variety but they also had chicken. I was on the fence about this dish. It was my first time trying it, so i wasn't sure if its supposed to taste better. It was good but compared to the other items I probably wouldn't order this again. Now for my *favourite* part! the mutton or fish rolls(I've tried them both, I think they have a different filling depending on day of the week). They are SPICY but so good you want to keep eating them despite the watery eyes. The flavours meld together well, and this is just all out carby flavour punch for $1.50 that you cant top for the price anywhere else. Totally worth the trek to 'Sauga.  Food to feed 4 people - $15."}
{"text":"I actually stumbled upon Anantha Bhavan, I didn't plan to go there. The M&M meat shop happened to be right next to it, so I had to check this place out. The first I tried there were the rolls. They had the mutton roll, chicken roll and veggie roll. I fell in love with all of them. It tasted so good and at a reasonable price too. Since then I have been coming to this place whenever I wanted a snack.   On my second visit, one of the cashiers recommended me to try mutton kotu and masala dosa. I've never tried mutton kotu before, so I thought of giving it a shot. It's a combination of roti and mutton scrambled together and my my my it was good. It was spicy but the flavour just explodes in your mouth.  The dosa, on the other hand, wasn't that great for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Wow wow. I went in there not sure if it was going to be be good or not. But it is good Large plate of great food for a great price. I had Mutton with rice chick pea's and some other items all for $6.75 I am a big boy and I was full after this meal. Perfect spice."}
{"text":"Thid is a small un-asuming take-out spot. It looked a bit dinky, but don't be fooled, the food was good. Had the mutton rotti and it was fantastic. The mutton curry was also very good and it comes with 3 scoops of different veggie curries (3 different varieties: split pea, pumpkin, and string beans)."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for the past 3 years. They have never failed to amaze me. In all these years I have never had a complain. A great place with great service."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast.  Although kitchen wasn't at full strength they prepared some killer savoury South Indian pastries that I have never tried before.  Chicken masala with egg, fish ball, chicken samosas etc.  Considered spicy for most but perfect for me as I'm more conditioned for these types of cuisine.  On my return trip to Toronto I'd be sure to revisit."}
{"text":"I went here for takeout, and I loved the food. Not only are the portions huge, the food is tasty and delicious. It was my first time trying out Sri Lankan food, and I wish I had tried it sooner!  I enjoy spicy food, but even I thought this had a bit of a kick to it. So for those of you, who can't handle spicy food, be warned that you might find some dishes really hot. That being said I liked the level of spiciness to the food. We tried the mutton kottu roti, chicken kottu roti and mutton biryani. I preferred the lamb over the chicken. Be warned the portion size is big good enough for 2/3 people or 2 meals. The prices are awesome $7 for a big portion of food.  Since it was my first time trying out Sri Lankan food, I tried a few different things there like egg stuffed roti, the different meat pastries, and this crepe like dessert filled with a sweet mixture.  I'll definitely be back to try out some more dishes."}
{"text":"The place was not busy (surprisingly) when I walked in around lunch time. The spread on the counter of curries and fried items seemed very limited and in tiny containers.   Ordered a Masala Dosa and Veg Kottu Roti. My go to dishes in a Sri Lankan restaurant. The fact that no other customers came in was worrisome to me that did I make a good choice by coming here.   The Masala Dosa comes in a container sliced in two rather than the entire wrapped in foil at one of nearby place (our favourite). The Dosa (crepe) much thicker than it should be make it too doughy and filling not flavoured enough. The accompanying sambhar was nothing great as well. The chutney too thin and watery but was surprisingly much better. It hit the right notes on flavour, spiciness and salt.   The Kottu Roti was cooked with minimal veggies and much spicier than I anticipated. I was fine, but the Mrs not so much. And this was asking it to be mild. Need to try the HOT when I am all alone. The redeeming factor was that it contained Nutrella pieces (Indian continent soy pieces). The quantity was disappointing as well.   $8.50 for a Masala Dosa (similar price to a sit down restaurant and much better quality or several $s expensive than the one sold at a nearby Sri Lankan place) and $7 for Kottu Roti - same as Masala Dosa. Now I know why there were not many people during lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a new Sri Lankan takeout that I discovered recently. The food is exceptionally good and the business has been picking up like crazy in the past few months. Make sure to try their mixed fried rice and chilli chicken! The chilli chicken in particular will bring true meaning to the word \"spicy!\""}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Aimlessly wandered in here a few years ago and was intimidated by the take out counter and people ordering in another language I went to the bakery in the same plaza instead. A few months later in the summer that same year I finally got over myself and went in on a mission.   I went in armed with Yelp and ready to order some mutton kothu roti since I love mutton and roti... what could go wrong? I quickly grabbed the order and left to eat at my friend's place. The dish was spicy, large in portion, flavorful and brand new spankin new on my taste buds.  My friend's dad was super impressed by my ability to pick up Sri Lankan food he didn't even know existed in Sauga.   After tasting the food, I go back quite regularly and have also tried a few different rolls(all different meats and $1/each) All of it was amazing. I've tried their chicken biryani which had a good spice and super large in portion ( 3 meals for me if not more). Now I eat right on their window shelf lol  Service is straight forward and nice!  I think I'm going to drop by this weekend ^_^"}
{"text":"OK, I read the great reviews and then decided to go to this place as it was nearby.   First of all, they only take debit card or cash - I came in from the US and had neither so I had to pay with US dollars. To my shock despite the US dollar being 30% stronger than the Canadian dollar, I was told the exchange was one for one - The horror!  Now, if the food was great I wouldn't have cared. The reality is that I was even more shocked with what I ordered. Granted, the rice and noodle dishes may have been much nicer than what I ordered, but I ordered the Mutton Curry, Chicken Curry and Vegetable Curry for me and my family to go.  I can't tell you which one was worse. The Chicken and Mutton curries were so oily it rendered them inedible - It effectively looked like a vat of red oil had been poured into a container. The Vege curry tasted like burnt mushy I don't know what.  Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder and maybe my experience is not indicative of this place, but I can't see myself coming here ever again."}
{"text":"I may have been more impressed if I understood what people were saying and what everything was.  I came in here on a Friday evening and it was quite busy. And I was a wee bit overwhelmed. I ordered a couple of items that were filled with veggie Currys. They were tasty. I got a sets dosas that came with a container of cold sambar and a bag of something... spices to add to the sambar I think. There was no Chutney which was pretty disappointing. Prices were very fair. I only paid 6 dollars and 75 cents and had way more than one meal.  I probably won't go out of my way in the future to go here but if I'm in the neighborhood it could be worth another stop."}
{"text":"It's a small take-out , looks like family owned, be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends,but  the food is good & the price is right..... VFM"}
{"text":"Great Sri Lankan food. I have tried their mutton and chicken kotthu roti and their biryani. Can get really spicy if you don't tell them to reduce the spice level. Good prices as well for the quantity. Bang for buck! It's only a take out spot."}
{"text":"Love this little gem. They don't have a menu per se visible but they have such a wide variety of tasty, nicely spiced exotic food. Well exotic to me. They have great customer service too."}
{"text":"It is a perfect south indian cuisine takeout restaurant. The food is amazing as an Indian this is my second loved one place to visit anytime after Gurulakshmi. NOTE: The curries could be spicy \" literally spicy\", so i would say warm your food at home at home and add some lemon juice. Moreover, please do check your take out order because i have ordered chicken curry but it was mutton instead. Also, they do not accept credit card."}
{"text":"I come here often for the iddiyupum (weekly) but that's because it's so close to where I live. They are a bit stingy when they give the coconut sambal (definitely not enough for 25 pieces of iddiyupum, but again I live close. I love vegetarian food and would definitely recommend the 5 veg curry, such great flavours when mixed and eaten altogether."}
{"text":"Amazing kotthu roti! Definitely worth a stopping by if you're craving something spicy to tantalize your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, WOW! We were craving some Kothu Roti (normally, we go to Markham to pick this up), but decided to try this place. We were pleasantly surprised. The food is so flavourful (NOT GREASY, like some of the other reviewers are saying).  We ordered the Mutton Rolls, Vadai, and Mutton Kothu Roti. Our favourite was hands down the Mutton Rolls, but the other two are just as great.  And did I mention the prices? We paid $1/ roll (amazing, since these things are pretty big), can't remember about the Vadai, but around the same, and the Kothu Roti was around $6.75. I know that they mentioned that their prices would be increasing this week (this shouldn't be a deterrent from coming here).  Try this place if you're in the mood for something different.   They have catering options as well, might just have to take them up on that offer!"}
{"text":"We were shocked when our order, for 2+ppl, came out to $13 'n change!  We ordered a Chicken Biryani ($6.75), Mutton Kottu Roti (~$2), & an egg dosa (~$2).  Out of the selection, I'd definitely order the Biryani again.  It's not quite Pakistani style, but still good with 2 moist, tasty pieces of chicken!  The Biryani came with something better than Raita!  (I usually don't like Raita, depending on how it's made.)  It was yogurt based with chopped, raw slices on onion + tomato.  You pour it on top and eat it with the Biryani.  Since we were eating al fresco, we couldn't heat up the egg dosa, so it was hard.  It may have tasted better warmed up, but I don't think I'd order it again.  Tastes just like what it sounds/looks!  Didn't have room for the Mutton Roti, so that'll be reviewed later.  Overrall, it was a nice change from eating Indian and cheaper too!    Warning:  Takeout only."}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by its cover! When you walk in here if definitely looks a bit run down I won't lie to you BUT the food is worth it. Most of the meals are around 6.75 and the portion sizes are huge. I've only tried the chicken and shrimp fried rice and tandoori chicken but this place always has people coming in and out picking up food. I've never had any issues communicating with the young man or woman behind the counter their English was fine. They even make recommendations and let me know what's popular. I just love he flavour profiles. The fried rice has bits of seasoned chicken and shrimp, bean sprouts peppers, chillies, carrots, broccoli and some kind of spice blend. It's just a little party in your mouth and at 6.75 what do you have to lose?"}
