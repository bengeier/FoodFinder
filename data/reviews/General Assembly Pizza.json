{"text":"I didn't think it  possible to have a tasteless pizza but General Assembly proved me wrong.  The Loving Cup (pepperoni) had no flavour at all and if there was wild oregano on it, I couldn't taste it.  I like a thin, crisp crust but this crust was blackened and bitter.  This was my first experience with General Assembly and will be my last."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and de-LIGHT-ful!
Stopped in here on a Sunday night after a day of hiking looking for a casual bite and was very pleased. We ordered at the cash and the pizza was ready within no time. I order the green pizza with the kale - it has the lightest touch of gorgonzola on it was nice since it didn't overpower the pizza and that dough!! So light, it was like eat a cloud! Would definitely go back + recommend."}
{"text":"I little pricey, but delicious.  All pizzas are small, (on size fits all).  Located on the south side of Adelaide St. W., west of Peter St., (a five minute walk from the Rogers Centre/SkyDome)."}
{"text":"Great little spot with excellent pizza and craft beer.  Service is very quick. Doesn't accept cash- just debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"Great dough, thin crispy and great pure tasting tomato sauce (not flat or bland), great atmosphere, so casual and chic yet no pressure. It is like a semi fast food style service. You order at counter pay and then food comes to your seat. Clean place. Taste is similar to queen margarita which i love as well. Really loved it."}
{"text":"Quick delicious pizza and fresh salad. Super friendly service as well! Placed a pick up order and went in the wrong door, someone immediately directed me to the other end and when I hesitated to go further past what seemed like the kitchen, another server assured me I was in the right spot. When I approached the check out counter from behind, the man there greeted me before I came around and said my order had just come out, one step ahead of their customers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Pizza  is fresh, homemade, flash fired in a fancy Naples oven and served in minutes. Kale salad  was perfect. 

Prices are incredibly reasonable. Cashless. No tipping. (And I wanted to leave a tip.) Coke in a bottle. From Mexico !!!

Staff is friendly and engaging. European style seating. Very nicely decorated. Very casual dining. And the 80s music  made me love it even more."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their kale salad. Usually their pizza is good, however, sometimes the dough is salty sometimes. Overall, a good place to eat, but not necessarily the best."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 pizzas + arugula salad via Uber Eats and it took over an hour to arrive. These are thin crust personal pizzas that take no more than 5 minutes in the oven so an hour is simply ridiculous. Each pizza and salad cost over $10 each and nobody was close to being full.

Considering that we are in Toronto there are plenty other places to get better pizza."}
{"text":"I liked it!  I'd come back.  

I tried the sausage pizza and the mushroom pizza.  Both were good.  The mushroom was tastier.  The crust was delicious!  

Lots of seating available but there's definitely a lunch time rush.  If you're making plans, keep that in mind.  

I liked the fact that it's a quick serve set up.  You pay for your meal, grab your number, and the food is brought to your table.  

The only thing lacking is dessert.  They do have plenty of drinks to choose from though."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this one out... it's fine.

The best of the four pizzas we picked were honestly the margherita. It was seasoned very well. I picked the Porky Pine which had tomato, aged mozzarella, ricotta, double-smoked bacon, jalape√±o, onion, and pineapple. The flavour was a nice mix of sweet and spicy, however I think the liquid coming out of the ricotta really softened the crust. The edges were clearly blistered, but the middle was soft to the point where I couldn't eat it with a fork and knife.

The size is more of a personal size than anything of substance.

It's cool that they offer vegan options. The service was super pleasant and efficient. The place was spotless, too.

Not bad if you're in the area but I wouldn't go out of the way for it."}
{"text":"I was hoping it would be good, however the Pizza was tiny and toppings were light, pretty tasteless... I know I know the place is relatively affordable but I would be willing to pay more for a better pizza. So many options in Toronto, this is at the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"Warm inviting space, good pizzas - I'd go back.  

They're Napoli style thin crust with a good topping selection ."}
{"text":"Second time. I came back when I was in Toronto again on business. Such a good find. I ordered takeout this time and it was just as good as the first time around. Super fast, reasonably priced, and the crust is amazing. Tried the sergeant pepper this time, which was perfect if you're in the mood for just cheese and spice."}
{"text":"On a rainy night when the bar hopping is done, no better place to get your carb fix than grabbing some carbs.
We popped into GA Pizza and this self serve, yet cool vibe venue did not disappoint. You approach the counter, place your food and drink order and grab a number before finding your own seat. Negroni's on tap while may sound suspect, were actually well balanced and a pleasure to drink. The only headache is having to get up again, order, pay and continue the libation. 
Freshly sliced prosciutto was a treat while we waited for our pies. Service was quick and the food awesome! Look out Libretto and Margherita, you have a contender."}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews, but couldn't stand to see people complaining about things other than the quality of the pizza. This is the best pizza I've ever had, and I've lived in three countries, been to Italy numerous times, and am originally from Chicago. I don't care if it costs three goats and two spoils of silk, I would get a better job to afford this pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the absolute best pies in the city. Great tap list and an extremely friendly and attentive staff too."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and it was a lot busier than I expected.
Very nice, modern place to eat as there are many group and communal tables.
They have a decent pizza selection so you have many options to choose from. We ordered the Loving Cup (pepperoni) pizza and the Falco sausage pizza. They were pretty good (a little bit too oily), however, I have definitely had better gourmet pizzas. 
My only complaint is that the food took way to long to come to our table (around 35-40 mins)."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Not traditional but interesting and tasty still. My only complaint is that they don't accept cash! What the heck! Lol. They only take card. One pizza is good for 1 person as they are pretty small and quite thin. Really nice interior and ambience."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and came here after watching a movie at Scotiabank Theatre. We ordered the green pie and the sweet heat pizzas. Both were very good - the dough was thin, soft, with a nice crust and tasty toppings. The ambiance is a bit dark and depressing in my opinion - there are no waiters, the place was empty, and you order at the front and bring your number to a table - so I'd recommend take out over eating in. I thought the pizzas were pretty expensive for the small size, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. 

Tip: Order on ritual until March 9th and save ~$3 per pizza."}
{"text":"2nd WORST Gourmet Pizza we've eaten in Toronto!

We've never really liked burnt crust in a pizza and this is the kind of pizza we got from General Assembly.

We ordered two kinds of thin crust Pizza: Loving Cup & King 'Shroom and both have burnt crusts!

I know there's a fine line between 'charred' and 'burnt' pizza and I'm telling you the pizzas here are flat out burnt! They don't have that smokiness flavour more of a bitter/acrid taste.

The Loving Cup with pepperoni is so bland, dry and lacking taste. The King 'Shroom white pizza is just plain boring and even the roasted garlic chips didn't help much to elevate the taste to the next level.

The place is super chic and modern but I'd rather go to a shabby and small pizzeria that serves amazing pizza than go to this fancy looking places that makes awful tasting pizza!

We also paid $32 for two pizzas and a Boylan pop - pretty pricey considering we didn't really enjoy the food! Will not be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"POSITIVE
nice, modern, clean interior.
3 single washrooms.
Staff was very friendly.
Good beer selection.
Sweet heat pizza, nice...

I won't do negative...
Enough negativity in this world."}
{"text":"This is a fancier pizza than your usual Pizza Pizza place, and you can say it's more 'Italian' than Pizza Hut. Other than that it's pretty typical pizza at a decent price. I liked the mushroom and blue cheese one, since I don't see that topping combo too often.

Service was DIY and interior was very chic, industrial minimalism with some flashes of bright runny yellow. It ticks all the 'trendy-downtown-good vibes only' boxes. Makes a great place for friends or coworkers to meet. Or even a casual date. Just order at the counter and get your own napkins/water."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to try the pizza here because the environment looks so nice from outside, plus the huge oven! 

However, my loving cup (pepperoni pizza) was sooooo salty, and it wasn't even the pepperoni, it was the dough that is very salty!! The salad we ordered was beyond salty as well. Seems they didn't have dressings on the salad, it was purely Oliver oil and salt... 
 
Crazy stuff and I barely leaI mean, the interior design is chic and staff is friendly, but their food will awake you at the middle of the night because your body is looking for water."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes, this one falls flat.  I was expecting something really good as they have giant pizza ovens that you can see through the window and their menu seemed very contemporary, including items like kale ... and a girl like me from the west coast needs her kale, especially on a cold windy night.

They don't serve mocktails anymore, menu online isn't up to date.  I tried two pizzas.  The mushroom one was ok but salty and the other pizza was forgettable.  The thing that both pizzas had in common was that they were both chewy.  I tried a kale salad and it was decent but also very salty.

Sharing plates are so small that it's impossible not to make a mess.  Also the atmosphere inside is VERY loud.  We were there at the same time as some wine party that was taking up the entire middle table and it was impossible to carry on a conversation.  I think it's just because of how the place is built.  Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"It took over 40 minutes for two thin crust personal pizzas to arrive on a Wednesday afternoon. Had the restaurant been packed I would understand but there were total of 3-4 tables. 

We ordered the Mila Margherita and Falco Sausage. The pizzas were thin and crispy with \"blackened\" crust.

Chic decor, burnt crust and lots of cell phone usage by the kitchen staff.

Expect 40+ min wait for average at best pizza. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"In an effort to find a holy grail pizza in Toronto (I found one recently in Edmonton), we tried out this relatively new place on a weekday night. I like the concept of the restaurant, you order up at the front, they give you a number, and you seat yourself along the long tables or one of the bench seats along the windows. You can watch the kitchen as they whip up pizzas or watch people walk by outside. It's a nice relaxed vibe in a pretty space.

Unfortunately, I found the pizzas disappointing. We had the Don Diego ($13) and a King 'Shroom ($14). The crust is thin and well charred, giving a great base for the ingredients. The portion is enough for one person for a full meal or two people for a snack. What I didn't like was that each pizza was dominated by a single ingredient. The Don Diego was all fire from the jalapeno and the King 'shroom was all blue cheese from the gargonzola. All the other ingredients were lost to these prominent overpowering flavors and was basically a waste. 

I think I will keep looking...."}
{"text":"It's really just okay when you get down to the food. Crust is not especially crisp or flavorful, and they go pretty stingy on the toppings as well. I ordered the Falco Sausage pizza, and despite being marginally tasty overall, I don't even remember there being bread crumbs or red onion on it. Service was fast and friendly and I like the spacious layout of the place, but aside from that, I can't give a whole-hearted recommendation of what they put out. My coworker ordered the Don Diego which looked heftier on the toppings, though."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The decor, ambience, service is amazing. The flavour - two thumbs up. Can't wait to go again and try a different type on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, recommend trying the mushroom pizza

{"text":"I'd walked by General Assembly Pizza quite a few times and I was certainly intrigued, so I jumped at the chance when the opportunity to sample their wares arose.

We arrived around 4:30 on a sunny Sunday and the place was pretty much empty. We were waiting for a third person, so we started out with a couple of drinks. I went to the counter to order and pay, and I was certainly surprised that I wasn't given an option to leave a tip.

Anyway, we finally did order a trio of pizzas a short time later and they were all quite good:

Sweet Heat (\"tomato, mozzarella, hot salami, chili, honey, basil\"): The first thing I thought after taking a bite was, \"wow, they were not kidding about the sweet part.\" This is indeed a very sweet 'za but it works. The combination of the other savory ingredients tempers the sweetness and I really found myself enjoying this pie as I was eating it.

Falco Sausage (\"tomato, parmesan, sausage, red onion, bread crumb, garlic, black pepper, chili flake, basil\"): This might've been my favorite pizza out of the three. Everything here worked so well together and the generously appointed toppings were all just about perfect.

Garden Smash (\"tomato, squash eggplant mash, red onion, spring onion, garlic, sesame, basil\"): The only other vegan pizza I've ever sampled was the rather mediocre one at Planta, so I had my doubts. But this was actually a pretty darn tasty concoction (though I don't really know if I would call it a pizza). Again, the various toppings all worked really well together and the squash eggplant mash actually made for a pretty perfect base.

I want to note also that the pizzas themselves were cooked perfectly, with the crust forming an addictive char that enhanced each pie. Also, the available chili oil was super hot and super tasty. All in all, a great experience. (And it's all surprisingly affordable, too!)"}
{"text":"What is with this trend of restaurants NOT accepting cash?!  It's legal tender, folks.  Do you really not trust your employees that much to handle cash?  For a pizzaria that has two beautiful pizza ovens I was shocked at how limp and chewy the crust was.  Also, my draft beer was flat.  Luckily, I also ordered a kale salad, which was fresh & delicious and saved the day."}
{"text":"Tried the kale and mushroom pizzas. A bit bigger than standard personal pizza. So delicious and quick. Staff was superb friendly and prices are reasonable. Definitely with the visit,"}
{"text":"Fire oven pizzas really does taste better than pizza cooked in regular ovens. The bread was nice and crispy. The only draw back is that there is a thin layer of burnt crust that I had to get rid of the whole circumference. Otherwise I got the sausage pizza and had an enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Very chic pizza place! The interior is very modern and you can see the workers making the dough and pizza while you eat. There are many group tables and one long communal table in the centre. The sweet heat pizza is exactly how it sounds, tasty if you like a sweeter and savoury pizza. The king shroom was good too. Pizza dough is soft and a little crispy, baked just perfectly. Nicoise salad was pretty standard. Also the bathrooms are individual and very clean and modern. Highly recommended and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is actually horrible pizza. The quality is terrible and it tastes fake. I have tried a lot of pizzas in Toronto and this is terrible. I have even considered writing a letter to the owner to let them know how terrible it is, since it's embarrassing that they market themselves as an amazing pizza place."}
{"text":"Ordered via UberEATS

Pizzas are definitely on the smaller end for the price. Pizza taste was mediocre - not a new favourite or anything. Similar to other reviews, crust was more burnt that I'd preferred.

Lots of better pizza places out there!"}
{"text":"Loooove their quick takeout section! It was hot and fresh! Depending on how busy they are, you get a hot fresh pizza in probably under 5 mins! We were there prime time dinner time so it took maybe 10-15 mins! 
The pizza I admit is more for one as it's a small Neapolitan thin crust! Regret not getting two instead of just getting one to share! Super close to our hotel, great place to chow down after bar hopping in the entertainment district! If you want to grab something quick you have to try this place! Wayyyyy better and much quicker than your average fast food pizza chains! 
Can't wait to try this mushroom one next time!!"}
{"text":"Relatively new place in Toronto and definitely a very pretty pizza place. I ordered their Sweet Heat pizza for $12 and I thought it was okay. It was very oily and quite moist. Flavours were good and I love the tomato base but for $12 and it's size, it's not that worth it..."}
{"text":"With the help of Ritual app, I learned the tastes of General Assembly.  This place perked my interest ages when I saw the words of \"Roberta's\", \"Pizza\", and \"Toronto\" crawl into my feed.  For those who don't know... Roberta's pizza reached cult hood status in the USA.  They have one of their chefs help consult on the menu for General Assembly... I know it's not them actually making the pizza.  Even having their name attached to General Assembly, it's gotta mean it's up to their quality to (some) degree.

This is what I would call a hip place that serves food quickly... from ordering via Ritual, I got the message ping not even 10 minutes later that it was ready for pick up.  Fast? oh yes.  The space is open and bright with a clean aesthetic.  It looks a little bit like a food hall with it's long shared tables.  The take out area is separate and behind the pizza ovens (which is where I had my view).  I wish I could say more about the service but it was proficient... that's all.  A 'hi' would be nice.

The style of pizza is what I would call Neo-Neapolitan... Yah thats wordy I know.  Crust is similar to Neapolitan but the subtle difference is a touch sweeter dough and less 'soggy' in the middle.  Traditional Neapolitan has the middle sometimes really soft.  The characteristic thin crust and charring is in full effect and i love the leopard spotting.  I know most people don't like it .. they think it's wrong but it's actually part of the style.  I recommend pizza hut pan pizza style if you dont like the charring. 

Here's a great thing... even an hour later after we got the pizza, the pizza still tasted great with a light warm up in an oven.  I would say the pizza sizes are not tooo big but it should be enough for a moderately hungry person.  I know some people could crush more but 1 works for me.

Green Pie with additional prosciutto (cause I cant resist the meat) - This intrigued me cause it had kale... Kale??  All the ingredients were mozzarella, gorgonzola, kale, lemon zest, black pepper... with the addition of my prosciutto.  One thing I loved so much was the lemon zest.  It added such a nice clean citrus notes that cut through all the cheese and prosciutto.  I would love this in the summer... and winter.  I felt the prosciutto a tad expensive ... i mean it was $4 for 4 slices.  Either way... it tasted quite good.  I'm used to a more flavourful crust (longer fermenting?) but this was still good.  Nice handling of the pizza to get the good leopard spots. 4/5 

Don Diego - Another solid pizza with its mozzarella, chorizo, red onion, jalape√±o, drop pepper, and cilantro.  I dont get soap mouth with cilantro so I liked it in there.  I felt there was a decent amount of chorizo with the medium-mild heat from the jalapeno and drop pepper.  Its a decent option if you're looking for something that isnt green.  4/5

Overall, my first impressions were positive and looking forward to trying out their salads with another type of pie.  Perhaps next time I'll go and eat there instead BUT if I'm needing run about and need good food fast ... this would be a good option."}
{"text":"I had the basic cheese pizza (forgot the name) and it was bomb. Way better than other overly hyped pizza places in TO. It was extremely thin crust but the flavour was amazing and they make it fresh for you. It isn't very big but ok for a single person; equivalent to eating 3 large slices. I would definitely recommend and come back !"}
{"text":"Found this place as I was walking passed and then a quick search it was also on Ritual where it is currently \"Eats Week\" where a few of their pizza is cheaper than norm.  I decided to try the sweet heat, Brooklyn style pepperoni (super large), mozzarella, tomato, honey, chilli and basil (in this case it looks like they forgot).

Three starts because the pizza was quite soggy--it wasn't bad, but wow was it soggy (or greasy).  The crust was like a very fresh naan but with a sweet note to it.  The toppings were delicious!  Worked so well together but would have loved the basil...

Ambiance was much like cafeteria style, long tables, loud and bright.  I did like the under table colour of turquoise paired with yellow chairs--very trendy.

Condiments were: Chilli oil, chilli flakes, the usual. 

Since I had ordered from Ritual there is an entrance on the west side (with takeout counter) and the kitchen with giant ovens is behind this counter separating it from the dining/cafeteria area.  If you are dining in you would go up to the counter on the east side entrance and order there, they would have you a number which you leave at your seat and they will bring it out.

There is also one gentleman in a white glasses room making pizza dough--it is definitely a \"feature room\" but poor dough maker has to be by himself while strangers looked on..."}
{"text":"I've been twice now-- once dining in and once for takeout. Try dining in at least once so you can experience their wonderful crust straight out of the oven (or if you're taking out eat a slice right away). All their pizzas are great but I thought the Sgt. Pepe (pizza version of Cacio e Pepe) was quite nice. No cash accepted, only cards."}
{"text":"The pizza here was very good. Flavour was solid and the environment was nice. Relaxed and no one rushes you to leave. The pizza was a bit smaller than I had hoped for my $12 Sweet heat selection. 
In general better value is found elsewhere but if you aren't on a budget and want a tasty & different type of za than this place is a good option."}
{"text":"Came here once and got 2 pizzas to go.  When I say pizza it's actually more like baked hipster bread with a sprinkling of toppings. Super thin. We had a sweet pepperoni one that was essentially like dessert."}
