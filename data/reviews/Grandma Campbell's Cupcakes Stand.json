{"text":"I received the samoa flavored cupcakes as a birthday gift, they are amazing and they come in a cup like cupcakes should, best cupcakes I've had in a long time! Cake was moist and fluffy toppings looked appetizing and plentiful, will definitely be heading to get more. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious...fresh and HUGE. You cannot beat 2.50 for a giant cupcake in their adorable pink boxes. Ordered the white wedding and the chocolate lovers as a gift and got fiance the white wedding. Neither party could stop raving. The girls behind the counter are so sweet and friendly. Will be back again. Do yourself a favor and grab a cupcake!"}
{"text":"Got two cupcakes...one chocolate chip cookie..kids ate that one no complaints but they shared it because they are def very sweet..I had the chocolate salted carmel..very moist cake with a carmel drop in the middle and rock salt sprinkled on top..once again the frosting is very sweet after half the cake I had to take of the frosting it was giving me a tummy ache..other wise very good and large size."}
{"text":"These cupcakes are the best in town, moist & soft & so big that they come in, like, a paper cup instead of just a cupcake wrapper. I wish they were open on Sundays, but I'll just have to get my cupcake fix the other six days of the week. Try the lemon, & consider getting there first thing in the morning for fresh-out-of-the-oven goodies."}
{"text":"These are great cupcakes. I highly recommend stopping and not just window shopping here!

My favorites have to be the pineapple upside down cake (amazing but seasonal), carrot cake, German chocolate, salted caramel (a little too salty sometimes), and the lemon.  The cake is moist, the flavors are authentic (hate when flavors taste like flavoring and not the natural flavor), the frosting is good (almost all buttercream or cream cheese based) and they are filling. My husband and I split one. 

Check them out next you are at the market or go to Campbell's sweet shop. They are the same cupcakes."}
