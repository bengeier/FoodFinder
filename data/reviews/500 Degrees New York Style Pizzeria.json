{"text":"My husband and I are always looking for decent local pizza places and boy, did we find one! Their pizza is the perfect thickness and has the perfect proportion of sauce and cheese. They also have super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Worst person who answered the phone,  SOOOOO RUDE. ...couldn't spell and had to repeat my address 3 times to. She HUNG up on me......, got on phone with \"the owner\" who refused to give me the name of the woman who hung up on me because \"since I didn't receive a product from them u was not their customer\"
I am not a person who YELPS a lot,,, so when I do I REALLY mean it! !!!don't go HERE EVER"}
{"text":"We had the veggie and cheese pizza here he other night and it was very good. The large is what we ordered and we only were able to finished one box! We also ordered plain cheesecake yum! I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Definitely not my favorite. This is a very small place with good customer service, at least this has been my experience. 

The menu is mostly your basic NY style pizza, subs and some pasta. The only one chicken choice is chicken parmigiana, other then chicken wings. Go here with the knowledge that the menu match's the name. 

If you live in the area, your lucky they do delivery! 

So yeah, guess what I ordered? A pizza and a sub. Plain cheese pizza was good. The meatball parm sub was very photogenic. (I am really getting into this whole food porn thing, I need to start taking more photos) If you like cheese and meatballs you need to order one a dee's suckers. 

I might have given them three stars because the pizza crust was too chewy (too much chew, not enough crisp crunch for me) and very skimpy on the sauce. The sub was really loaded down with cheese like a heart attack waiting. Service was good and they seem to be Yankee fans so I will go back to try other items but since their name says \"NY pizza\" I needed to get that one squared away.

IMO, my favorite is some tough competion but four stars says\" Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Run of the mill pizza chain; I was deceived by the 5 stars on yelp. If you're looking for amazing pizza, this is not the place."}
{"text":"What a treat! 
I stumbled upon this place by accident and took a chance.  My gamble paid off.

The menu is extensive,  including desserts!

How about they deliver!"}
{"text":"Best pizza this side of the Hudson River. Sure I've had better in Long Island & the. 5 Boroughs but a lot worse too. This is the pizza joint \"around the corner\" in every way down to the cannoli & Italian ices. Try the Sicilian (spot on) ......and just like back home, the slices are always better ordered individually (crispier) - but the pies are great. Family run (good people). Won't be disappointed, best NY Pizza in CLT hands down & I've tried em all."}
{"text":"The Pizza in Charlotte bar none.This place has true NY pizza. I love it and go at least once a week."}
{"text":"attention : new york pizza does not have online ordering there is a website named : www.bringmethat.com that has them listed there, however this website is a scam they have noo agreements with any restaurants on their site . also their prices are way higher . please call if you want to order from new york pizza ."}
{"text":"I love this place and go out of my way to stop here when I am in the mood for pizza.  I lived 14 years on Long Island, NY and have seeked out the best NY style pizza in Charlotte.  There are now several places that have very good NY Pizza, but I believe this to be the best.  

Last night I was craving their Pizza Bianca (White Pizza) with fresh tomato.  It was outstanding!!!   If you've never had white pizza, you must give this pizza a try.  It has the perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  All the flavors melt in your mouth.  

After devouring the white pizza last night, my boyfriend and I said we must write a review and let people know about this place.    You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food is good and hot, staff is friendly and clean. Resturant is clean. I will be back."}
{"text":"The pixies is great.  I am from NY and it is reminiscent of upstate NY pizza.  Last weekend we ordered hot buffalo wings and a cannoli . Both were great. The only disappointment was that we did not get carrots and celery with the wings. We will definitely eat there many more times."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times for lunch.  The pizza slices are huge...If I closed my eyes I would think I was back home.  Great crust.  Sandwiches are great and the wings are superb.  This is my go to place when I want to take a pizza home."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite & found New York pizza. I had a meatball sub & my husband had the chicken parmigiana sub- both were excellent.  12\" subs with fries for a very reasonable price. We wrapped 1/2 of each sub to take with us, but splurged on dessert- tiramisu and cannoli. Again, fantastic! The staff was extremely busy, but not too busy to check on us to be sure everything was ok. If in Charlotte again, New York Pizza will be my 1st stop"}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner tonight....

NY Pizza gets 4 stars because they are true to their name.  The pizza is exactly as what we have in NY.  The only small difference is in the crust.  These guy's crust is thinner than the regular crust of NY pizza, but other than that, this is NY pizza if I've ever had any.

I bought a a 14' plain chees pie, some buffalo wings and a 2 liter bottle of coke and paid $14 for it.  The food was good and so was the price.

Thanks to the yelpers for pointing this one out!!"}
{"text":"Looks like new york pizza, feels like new york pizza, but the taste falls short. 1st time here will try one more time..."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, this is some of the best pizza you can find here in Charlotte.  I always order the combo pizza with ricotta, mushrooms, onions, and sausage, and have not found a better pizza anywhere. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got the stuffed pizza slice with marinara dipping sauce. Cheap, fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, it gives us more variety in the Starmount/Montclaire area. No offense against the Latino restaurants, but they are all over the place with roach coaches to boot. If the dudes that run this place are not of Italian heritage I'll eat my tennis shoes. Any way great non chain pizza. The best steak subs since the Pizza House on Central. Somewhat slow at time, but I think those cheese steaks take longer the way they are prepared. Never tried anything else but pizza and subs. No need to."}
{"text":"i created this account just to leave this review reading all the reviews about this place some saying good some saying bad i had to let you know if you like chuck e cheese pizza you will probably love this place me personally im a grown up with taste. if this is what you call thin crust ny style pizza you have no clue, i would rather have papa johns dominos or pizza hut. this pizza was so bad i still have a weird taste in my mouth while writing this review,  if you want real ny style pizza go to luisa's pizza on abby st off montford near park and woodlawn they toss it and brick oven bake it, i love how i see people writing this is the best pizza in charlotte OMFG they have to be friends with the owner because i can name so many better places for pizza revolutions in noda is the absolute BEST, mellow mushroom, brixx, luisa's, theres even a bowling ally on montford called george papas that has better pizza then this place if you waste your money on this place im sure you will be in the same postion i am in pissed off and writing a review."}
{"text":"This pizza was the absolute BEST thing about being stuck in Charlotte after the weather caused us to miss our connector flight.   It was delivered right to our hotel room door at the precise time they promised.   The pizza was hot, thin crusted and had fresh toppings."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this place for some time. The employees are always nice, and the food never takes to long. I usually call ahead and its always ready. I typically get the small spaghetti and it never disappoints. It can get a little pricey however when ordering for a large group. Some sort of rewards program for loyal customers would be nice. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never disappoints, one of this road warriors favorites when in town fresh ingredients awesome thin crust, friendly folks"}
{"text":"Ordered an 18\" beef and it was all I'd hoped for, large and delicious. Also got the cheese garlic bread and was also great. I'd definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"As far as casual pizza joints go, this is def a top contender. Cleanliness, service, prices, and food are on point.

Their New-York Style pizza is delicious. The crust is baked well, the cheese is great, and the toppings are.... so good. It's pretty amazing that they can deliver a tasty slice at the right price.

As for atmosphere, it's a clean restaurant that is thoughtfully put together. What really please me was that each booth had a paper towel rack installed with seasoning right below; once I'm chowing down on my pizza, I am not getting up for anything! So with everything I need is conveniently placed near me, I enjoyed every bite without having to move.

Service is nice and friendly.

I would return here for lunch or for a late night snack. Def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Its been a while now since i visit. First time here since name changed came with my  sisters and nephew. I ordered a slice of veggie pizza and garlic knots. We were all very disappointed, its not like it was before. I ate some, wanted to trash the rest of it but I don't have money to waste. One of my sis had 2 slices of Sicilian and only could finish 1. Other sis order lasagna and she said it was bland, not good at all. Customer service and beverages were great!!"}
{"text":"Attn all Northern imports! Get cha pizza here! 
No seriously. This is authentic New York pie that I've been searching for awhile now. They deliver to Southend too. Quick! Doesn't get better than that. Fah get abou itttttt"}
{"text":"This is probably in my top 4 favorite pizza places in Charlotte. Its as close to real New York style pizza as you can possibly get in this city. It's very unassuming as it sits in a strip mall but go in, and you know its going to be legit. 

They have a pretty extensive menu too, past just pizza's they have wings (that we'd like to try), entrees, and desserts. Other than just their regular slices, they have this one called a \"Stuffed Slice\" and seriously, one slice is enough for a family! Its stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, and bacon and its a meat lovers dream. 

My only downfall with this place is they clearly get a lot of delivery or pick up calls or something because when we go in, we definitely find ourselves waiting for a pretty decent amount of time before we get our food. Also, they're closed on Sundays, which is just ridiculous for a pizza place, but, it is what it is. If you're looking for New York style pizza, come here."}
{"text":"Great place, tasty food! Went hungry and ordered so much had to take the rest home.
Single slices are huge like 2 pieces in one. The stuffed pizza was great and not chewy or greasy.  Got the tuna sub, very good. Slice of pepperoni and the Sicilian way better than any other place. Fuel pizza in town can't compare,  wish there was one in Rivergate!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are coming back from a trip to Florida. It's an 11 hour trip and we're exhausted so we decide pizza is gunna be the way to go. 
   I'm a big fan of New York style pizza. It's  probably my favorite. I'm no connoisseur but   I definitely know a thing or two about good pizza. We ordered a large pizza that was half pepperoni and half spinach.
    Once we opened the box , I was mesmerized. It was so neat and the toppings were abundant and evenly distributed. The pizza was also delicious! It was nice and cheesy just the way I like. The crust was also just the right thickness for maximum foldability. 
     They do New York style pizza right. I was not expecting that from this little pizzeria in South Carolina. If I didn't live 1000 miles away I would definitely come more often."}
{"text":"Went in and asked for a slice.  They told me that were out of slices.   I ordered a personal pie.  Waited about 20 min for a to go pie.   End of crust was good but the sauce was off putting to me.    I wanted to try this place it is good but there are better pies out there."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and I've always had a good experience. I've never eaten inside...Always take out. I've tried the pizza, garlic bread, and salad. Everything I had was really good. The staff is always friendly, and the wait is never long."}
{"text":"Mmmmm....GREASY goodness...I mean dab it with a napkin and it's still covered in grease kinda good slices here! 

I was craving some pizza and wanted to step out of the big chain places so off to New York Pizza I went. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. But I was able to order in no time, just one pepperoni slice....and it was less than $3 so that's a win.

The inside is quaint. It's a couple of table and chairs, booths, tvs...nothing fancy.

My pizza actually came up pretty quickly and I was out the door in no time! 

The pizza crust was good, there were plenty of pepperonis, cheese...and of course grease! The sauce had a little kick to it, but it was not overwhelming and I liked it. I agree with Ben G, it's a different \"kind\" of NY style pizza...but still very tasty! 

I look forward to trying their wings and fries and subs, when I was waiting for my order someone had ordered the philly cheese and it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"The five star is for their tasty food. I have always gotten food delivered so never been to their restaurant.... Yet.
I am super bummed out that they took off the combo pie(a pizza with any 4 toppings of your choice). That was my go to all the time.... This might decrease the frequency I order from then now. :("}
{"text":"So for Charlotte, this is still decent. However, DaVinci's in University City is THE JOINT! This pizza, the first time,  was awesome. Now, it's inconsistent, they crisp the crust too much, and it's too dry. I will give them 4 stars because they still hustle on those deliveries."}
{"text":"Owner was rude.  The grandkids were active and knocked over parmesan.  He tried to yell at them but rethought his actions after my look of concern.  Must admit that he can cook though!  Pizza was relish and my meatball sandwich with sausage was absolute to die for!  Lah is was good.  Kids loved their pizza as well.  And they eat all of my tiramisu before we got out of the car!  It was that good.  I smeared my finger over the bowl and was in love.  Try everything.  It is good."}
{"text":"Chose this company since ranked 1 here on Yelp but it was just okay.  The crust was not very good (too hard for 6 of our tastes)."}
{"text":"Let me start that I really wanted to like this place. Being in town for 1 night in a hotel with no car, and reading the great reviews on yelp I thought for sure I'd have a knockout meal that'd be delivered to my door. Boy, was I disappointed. Try as I might I just couldn't enjoy much of this meal. 

I wanted to try a bit of everything so I ordered a regular slice, a stuffed slice, a side salad and some buffalo wings. Here are the pros/cons of this meal:

PROS:
- friendly service, from the person taking the order to the delivery guy
- quoted delivery time was met (45-1hr), delivery guy even gave me a ring to give me a heads up he was about to arrive
- salad was good and fresh
- portion sizes definitely match the price, the slices are BIG, toppings were plentiful

CONS:
- wings were a bit overcooked and tough
- the stuffed slice was dry, almost like a pressed panini
- holy salt lick batman, both slices were so incredibly salty that my mouth and tongue were left numb. You can barely taste the toppings, especially in the stuffed slice which probably had an entire shakers worth of salt in it by the taste. 

Maybe it's much much much better if you dine in, I can only hope so. But based on my experience, once is enough for me."}
{"text":"Have had their pizza several times. Sometimes great and sometimes not that great (don't like when the cheese pulls off the crust and isn't integrated). Well, let me tell you, I ordered delivery of their spaghetti with meat sauce, side salad and garlic knots for the first time and all were amazing. Yes, 500 Degrees delivers their own food. 

Spaghetti with meat sauce -- Not sure what their secret is but the sauce did not \"suck into\" the pasta and become dry. The meat sauce has an amazing consistency so that it remains separate from the pasta and is even better the next day. No additional seasoning is needed (unless you want super spicy or seasoned) and delivered hot to my door. 

Side salad -- The basic side salad was huge and fresh (though the tomatoes were a bit mealy and expected this time of year). Very basic with black olives, romaine lettuce and a few other things. Can't be picky about tomatoes in March. 

Garlic Knots -- Oh my gosh. These creations are amazing and I placed leftover knots in the freezer for future use (which I have). The order also came with really wonderful italian bread which is in the freezer along with the garlic knots. There has to be a secret recipe because these things are amazing and reheat perfectly well.

All told, I had three meals from one order and had to cook additional pasta to consume all the sauce. Never has happened before and much appreciated. I usually receive too much pasta and not enough sauce and arrives dry to my door. 

Yes, I will be ordering again soon. Fabulous comfort food. Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"I'm a sort of pizza snob coming from Chicago. I've tried several other pizza places in the area. This place takes the top honors. The garlic bites were great and the Sicilian style pizza surprised me. Great flavor, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Perfect. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with other folks here. It's a hint towards great NY pizza, or perhaps another style of NY Pizza that I've yet to experience. Regardless, I'm a fan. It was pouring, bitter cold, I had been sick all day, and I wanted some effing pizza for dinner. These guys were awesome. Can't comment on dining at their home base on South Blvd, but the delivery, as was the product, was fan-freaking-tastic. 

Simple ordering. They deliver in a 5-mile radius from the shop. We're just in at 4.7mi. Score! 

We were quoted about an hour due to the weather and every other soul in Crown Town ordering pizza at that exact moment. However, our delivery guy showed up in about 40 minutes. Bless his heart, man. He was a trooper. Super nice guy, too.

Went with the 18\" (more like 18') white pizza -- add spinach AND tomatoes. You apparently get either/or. Also scored a slice of their stuffed pizza. First, the stuffed slice. Stuff is awesome. Manageable to pick up and eat like a normal slice, but fork and knife made it easier for dunking into the marinara. The marinara was a little watery for my liking, but not a deal-breaker. I inhaled it. Not just because it was the only thing I had eaten all day, either. 

The white pizza. Goodness gracious, it didn't even fit in the box! It was massive. Each of us ate one slice and called it quits. Had we some friends over it would have been gone, no doubt. Good luck tackling this monster with just two. The flavors were great. A little overzealous with the ricotta, but the garlic flavor was nice. I'd order it again, but not in the 18\" variety. 

I'm a fan. I'd definitely count on these guys for trusty delivery yet again, but look forward to dining in house with a nice, foldable slice of cheese or pepperoni!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best NY style pizza in Charlotte. Took me 5 years to find a good pizza joint. This ranks right up there with Upstate Pizza, but NY Pizza is closer to my house. Highly recommend to anyone that appreciates a real NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place on this side of town. Cheap, fast, and delicious. Also very nice atmosphere inside. Definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"I'm from New York city and I know NY STYLE PIZZA and let me tell you this place is as close as your gonna get without actually being there! Friendly service and the food is cooked while you wait. Reminds me of home Everytime I go there. I would go there more often if I knew it wasn't so fatten! 

Definitely try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is my go-to pizza place! I haven't had anything from here that was bad. Although I wouldn't get the garlic bread again, the garlic knots are phenomenal. The baked ziti is sooooo good too. If you want some great pizza or pasta, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Wow I am so glad I found this place, being from NYC this by far the best pizza I have had in Charlotte. Toppings are fresh and quality of ingredients is very good while being reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Charlotte so far and I've had a lot. Libretto's, Fuel, and Brixx can't touch this place. I wouldn't say it's a bargain, but you definitely get what you pay for. Around $20 bucks for a true, NY style large pizza that I can make 3-4 meals out of, is very reasonable. The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is incredible. My only gripe is that they shutdown for random holidays, but it's family owned, so that's understandable."}
{"text":"I feel like whoever wrote the  5 star reviews had to be family and friends and I feel mislead.  We ordered the pizza and wings as people on Yelp said they were the best in Charlotte.  The pizza and wings were so eh... I would call them fine.  I think there are much better options for both.  If I lived around the corner I would go from time to time if hungry but that's about it."}
{"text":"This pizza is so awesome!!!! I am so excited that they are in Charlotte...
I am a NYer and this is the best pizza I've had in years!!"}
{"text":"Pizza looks great.  Wings were good. Customer service is very nice. Establishment is very clean."}
{"text":"I was kinda leery on them changing their name but when I tried them, the ingredients and the food had gotten better. It's a little piece of NYC in charlotte.. and I love it! I recommended anyone to this restaurant no complaints over here."}
{"text":"Well, I was very pleased with the pizza here! The 18\" pie was very large for the \"big eaters\" in my family. The cheese was good. The meats were good. The crust was great! Really thin & really tasty! As my New York friends would say, \"you can make it New York Pizza unless you ship in the New York water!\" I was in NYC just a couple weeks ago & had some pizza. I'd say this is as close to what I ate in NYC as I can get here in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Great pizza but slow service.  The seating area was dirty and looked like an old dairy queen setup inside,  not in a good way.  Located not in the best area!"}
{"text":"Can get pizza by the slice and the stromboli and garlic bread are excellent as well. NY Pizza also has extremely quick service."}
{"text":"I went to a pizza place and got a sub... I know, I know....

I literally drive by this place twice a day and have never noticed it.  It is in a shopping center at the intersection of Archdale and South Blvd.  I work close by and some coworkers had gotten takeout pizza before and it smelled delicious.  Since I am southern by birth and have no frame of reference for New Yawk style pizza, I am assuming based on the oooh's aaah's and regular visits of our resident Lawng Islandah that this is the real deal.  If huge, greasy slices are what New York pizza is, then this place fits the bill.  It did smell delicious, but I declined that day.  Everyone seemed happy and full (although a few came by my desk asking for Shout wipes and Tums - I guess we are all accustomed to chain delivery places).  A lil grease in moderation never killed anyone though, eh?

Today a group of 8 of us ventured over there for lunch.  We arrived right around noon and the place wasn't packed, but they were relatively steady with people who seemed to be regulars (that's a good sign).  You order at the register and then wait for your food.  With 8 separate orders, we should have known this was going to be a bit of a cluster, but we all enjoy the company of the others, so it's all good.  

The pizza slices came out immediately.  Huge slices, layer of grease on top... they all looked and smelled delicious.  The pizza peeps were happy and we told them to eat and not wait on us.  And then the wait began...

I ordered a meatball parm sub and a drink ($10).  The girl who ordered behind me ordered the same thing.  The girl behind her ordered a calzone. 2 ham and cheese subs after that.   I honestly couldn't see behind the counter when they were making the sammiches, so I am not totally sure what happened to the orders after me.  The pizza slices were on the table quickly, 1 of the 2 ham and cheese's came out.  Several minutes later my meatball sub.  Many minutes later (10-15?) the pizza folks were done, I had started on my meatball sub and fries, and we were still waiting on the calzone (which could have been made fresh, which would explain the wait), a meatball sub and a ham and cheese sub.  Someone from the table got up to check... another 5 minutes... here comes the meatball and the calzone.  Finally our lone remaining order of a ham and cheese sub, who luckily is the most patient and wonderful of the group, asked for his sandwich to be put in a to-go box as we had been there for almost an hour by then.  With 8 people all at the same time, and all ordering separately, the timing of the orders really can't be judged, but 30 minutes for a ham and cheese sub is a lil nuts.  And to have two of the same order, ordered back-to-back, that were spaced at least 15 minutes apart, that was a little odd too. 

The food was quite good.  The sub was a standard meatball sub covered in cheese, but the fries are AMAZING.  Double fried or something to make them extra crispy, but oh so delish (extra blockage, hooray!).  The calzone, when it finally got to the table, was huge and served with marinara.  I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of my group and the portions of the sandwiches were large enough that most had lunch and then got a to-go box with the other half for another meal.  

Good restaurant for a \"slice and a Coke\" (my only frame of reference for ordering pizza in NYC is an episode of Sex and the City), my only suggestion would be that if going in a large group, stick to slices so everyone is eating around the same time."}
{"text":"Delicious! Salads are huge and packed full of flavors...and the pizza was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend you trust your instincts, and go eat here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I have and \"authentic\" New York pizza before.
But the pale in comparison to the piazza here.
I read the reviews with skepticism, mainly due to the crunchy pizza crust and bottom.

I have to say that the reviews were true.
Extremely crispy which includes the Sicilian pizza (I know it better as pan pizza).
The dough between the crust and topping was soft but not undercooked.  
I went for the lunch special, one cheese pizza, and a sausage pizza.  Both were crispy bottom that you could fold.  The portions were the size a a New York style pizza... LARGE!

I would highly recommend this place for the crispy crust alone, but the topping are delicious and fit well with the pizza."}
{"text":"I will be honest I wasn't trying to eat. I was in the plaza to shop. But so be it. The best New York pizza style I have had in a while. My friend n I spilt a two pizza combo... which was a awesome $6 with a drink. WINNING! We tried to revisit on Sunday but they're closed... Next time my friend... next time... We will meet again lol"}
{"text":"The crust makes it. Crisp and light. I think the cheese and toppings are good. Like the menu and will have try the sandwiches and other offerings. Lunch special of $4 for two slices and a drink is hard to beat. Will definitely be back. I'd say it's my favorite slice in town along with Louisa's."}
{"text":"Great pizza! It has been a long time since I have had GOOD NY PIZZA! This is it. We will be back for sure. If you are not from around here, trust me we'd eat here regular if we were. Thanks so much for a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best NY style pizzas in the city.  Location is not much to look at on the outside, but very clean and fresh on the inside.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and hot wings!!!!!   Def will have this delivered again!!!   Cheese sticks were still hot and sauce was good."}
{"text":"Ordered the garlic knots and bbq chicken pizza. It was SO good! Place is clean and service was quick and great! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"One of my close to home \"Go To\" pizza spots.  It's good.  Traditional, fast casual, New York Style pizza.  Family owned and operated.  It's got your standard Pizzeria menu with subs, salads, some pastas, apps, and of course pizza.  They are reasonably priced and the owners are friendly.  They used to have it set up so you could see the pizza being made, but now there's a high counter blocking the view.  Too bad, I like being able to see the dough being stretched and the skill of the kitchen workers.  Everyone should have a pizza place like this close to home!
One of my favorite things about the pizza is the crisp crust.  This is easy to find when eating a reheated slice, but not so easy when you order a whole pie.  They make one of the crispiest fresh pie crusts in Charlotte.  There's always a nice snap.  This pizza will fill you up, it can be heavy in the belly, but comfort food does that.  This is better pizza than most in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker orginally and a pizza snob and I am sorry this is not the BEST in Charlotte.   Although it is very very good it is still missing what Tony's in Ballantyne has perfected...crispy crust.  Your pizza needs to crunch!  The taste and amount of cheese and sauce were perfect and the garlic knots delish as well, but not the best I'm sorry.  I will be back no doubt if I am in the area and the price is great especially for the size...I would even say top 5 but no blue ribbon."}
{"text":"I've grew up eating NYC pizza my whole life and this place brings me back home,but unlike some of the places I've been too in Charlotte this place serves the Jamaican beef patties !  I order my patties with mozzarella cheese sometimes I add pepperoni. Super delicious ! Overall the place is clean with a friendly staff. They have great lunch specials as well. I Recommend this place to anyone from jersey or NYC if you want that great pizza taste from home"}
{"text":"Used to get their specials and pizza's but due to their portions getting smaller and prices getting bigger I just go with slices-which are delicious btw. Staff is always friendly and quick. Sad to see my favorite calzone go to the waist side though."}
{"text":"New York pie???? Afraid not. You want real New York style pizza ? Try Louigis ! Don't settle ."}
{"text":"You gotta love them from the outstanding customer service as well as the food my
Favorite is 10 BBQ wings with a slice of pepperoni mushroom and onion pizza! 5stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza place. But even better is that they are more than good pizza. They have great sub sandwiches and very good salads. It's our go to Pizza place. Fast and easy delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from New York Pizza the other night, and I was quite satisfied.  Pizzas are large - we ordered two larges for eight people and had plenty left over.  The garlic knots were amazing (as everyone else has mentioned), and the pizza was tasty as well.  We got the \"two larges with one topping each\" special for $25, as well as wings and garlic knots.  Wings a little small and not anything special, but garlic knots were great.  Only downside with the experience is that the delivery boy must have tilted the box when on his way here - pizzas were smooshed on one wall.  Otherwise, perfect experience!"}
{"text":"Just had a few of their monster pizza slices. Finally, a restaurant that claims to serve New York style pizza absolutely delivers! I am a native New Yorker and will definitely come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Make it 3 1/2 stars. 
If you want NY style pizza that's exactly what you get. Not that real NY pizza is the best mind you (far from it) but it makes for great comfort food. And this one is not tasteless like \"Tony of Charlotte\"s pizza. Hey Tony NY called and they want their subway map back, you fake!

I had a slice of Sicilian with extra cheese the first time (Yes!) and a plain slice the second time. If you saw the pizza that Trump shared with Palin this is it. It tastes exactly like the pizzeria from across the street back when I lived in New Yawk, at least before the Greeks took over and ruined it. Plenty of cheese (extra would be an overkill) good sauce and a huge slice for $2.45. 

No, it's not crispy! NY style  pizza NEVER is -other than Frankie's in Miami, I don't know how they do it.  Not even Ray's Pizza* was crisp. NY style is rich, gooey and runny. And you tap a paper napkin on it to absorb some of grease so it doesn't run all over your chin. This is not fine food, it's pig-out comfort food. I've long outgrown this stuff. For dinner it's crispy, thin crust brick (open) oven or nothing but a slice for lunch ... hits the spot like the good old days.

Wanna know what's not authentic about this joint? No freaking way that you'd have to wait for a simple slice in NYC, especially not ten minutes like you do here. Are you kidding me?

I haven't tried any of their toppings and honestly they didn't look too famous, I'd stick to the plain slice or the Sicilian w/extra cheese.

*  Ray's pizza became famous in the seventies, there was only one location and it was called just  Ray's Pizza - the night shift cabbies stopped there at 2 -3 am, that's how the word spread around. All these \"Originals Ray's\", Famous Ray's are just copycats. A thanks to Mike S.  for reminding me!"}
{"text":"The evenings hunger attack let me to New York Pizza as New York I wasn't feeling like getting into the great debate of if the pizza was as good as that back home. So I took my trusty taste buds and ordered the calzone and some wings instead . The hot wings, while they could a been a lil bit hotter for my tongue, they were tasty,  flavorful, and down right delicious.  My pepperoni mushroom and onion calzone was a work of art. A long time lover of calzones, they could not have done any better if they contracted me to come over and show them a few tricks.  I finished this off with some hot cheesy garlic bread that was succulent..... M"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for awhile now based on friends' reviews and my love for pizza, all kinds of pizza. Stopped in on my way home from work to get food to go. I was greeted upon walking in. The place is small near the end of a strip center. Appears clean and nicely decorated for a pizza joint. I ordered hot wings extra crispy, small salad and one slice of pepperoni pizza. I waited less than 10 minutes. I was concerned the food wouldn't be great because I live over 15 minutes away and it was rush hour. Wings were buffalo hot, could have been a bit crispier but they tasted great. Salad was nice and fresh---thank you. So many times in a small place like this, the salads are never fresh. Slice of pepperoni pizza was dripping in grease and covered in cheese---perfect!  Exactly what I was hoping for. The bottom was crispy but also folded nicely in half so I didn't even up getting grease on me. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for this type of place. Would I return--sure!"}
{"text":"Came here with very low expectations because I haven't really found good new york style pizza in the south but this definitely turned out better than I thought it would be! Got two slices of the sicilian cheese for $2.5 each and a small pasta with meat sauce for $5 in case we weren't full. My one gripe would be we wanted a slice of cheese pizza but they were out?? This was 6pm on a Saturday night. What establishment doesn't have slices of cheese pizza available?? 

Got our food pretty fast, sicilian squares were decent sized, piping hot, crunchy bottom, cheese tasted great, sauce was great. All in all a great slice of pizza. I added some of the red chili flakes and parm they had on the side. I think they also had salt, pepper, and garlic powder. They had some convenient paper towels rolls on the wall. 

The pasta was also great, just spaghetti from a box but the sauce was pretty good and it came with half a baguette size of garlic bread which was great! 

Overall quality of food was great. Apparently it's cheesier than real NYC pizza but I liked it that way haha. Pretty cheap, but please next time I go they better have cheese pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Pizza is fair, nothing like I've had in NY. Crust is slightly too thick for me and the sauce misses the kick. Nice staff. Greek salad with chicken was fair as well.  Chicken tasted like it was precooked."}
{"text":"5 stars for their wings, haven't tried anything else.  For the price and flavor of the hot wings I don't think you can beat it.   The price will keep me loyal, the lemon pepper garlic wings are really good too, supper flavorful!  $18.00 for 25 wings! Yup, I'll be a regular.  Found this place by pure accident, I would've never came here because the location and name.  My daughter was eating them and I tried one and couldn't stop eating them, I ended up eating most of her food so I had to go back to where she bought them to replace her food..lol"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Little hold to place orders. The pizza is super good and I love their buffalo wings. Their cheese garlic knots not so much."}
{"text":"Yup-it's that good.  We ordered a combo pizza with our four faves and had them do it well done with extra sauce.  Delivered in 30 minutes--DEEElicious.  Support these guys--finally a great pizza joint! (The Greek salad is fantastic, too)"}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and garlic knots. Everything was fantastic! This will be our new goto for delivery pizza. Can't wait to try other items."}
{"text":"This pizza is the bomb! Hands down my favorite pizza in Charlotte. It's so good, every time. Some of my other favorite menu items (on the rare occasion I can talk myself into NOT getting pizza) are their wings and stromboli, and my husband is a sucker for their tiramisu."}
{"text":"Nasty! I was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  Just went to NYC in Oct so wanted to compare.  Sorry not NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Not bad and not extraordinary.  This is what I call an \"if\" place.  By that, I mean:

The pizza is pretty good, *if* a little greasy.  The service is polite, *if* kind of sloppy (I got my food a good 10 minutes after my coworkers got theirs).  The prices are reasonable, *if* not amazing...and so on.

The slices here are huge, so you only need 1, especially if you ordered a side."}
{"text":"The Margherita is pizza pie perfection. Never an issue with delivery.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I chose the highest rated Pizza joint in Charlotte, NC. This place did not disappoint. Great NY style pizza in North Carolina."}
{"text":"If you want consistently good pizza and not one of the big chains (Pizza hut, dominos, etc), then try 500 degrees. This is my go-to pizza place in Charlotte for NY style pizza. Please note, ilve always eaten in, so I cannot speak to delivery. This review is for dine-in only."}
{"text":"Coming from New York City and eating this type of fast food for my entire life I have to say these guys are on the mark.  They live up to their name.  Charlotte does not have alot of authentic NY style pizzeria's.  This is my favorite by far, perfect amount of seasonings, great tasting crust.  The hero's are good as well, chicken parm and meatball are the only one's I've had and they are both good, but you go here for the pizza.  Don't waste your time with the others, if you like NY pizza then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"We are SO grateful to have a good pizza place so close to home. Consistently great service and delicious pizza. Not a big fan of their sausage pieces, but other than that, we're always happy to grab a pizza to go and share it with our family and friends."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style - great crust and fresh plentiful toppings. Tried the wings  and calzones all equally good. Delivery was on time. Can't beat this place."}
{"text":"I order carry out a large pepperoni pizza & service was fast. Paid $19 . The sauce was not spicy, put lightly on, bread & crust perfect but some how the meat overall made the pizza greasy... This pizza was saltier which was not to my taste.
I might return and try other stuff if on this side of town. Giving 2 less stars for pricing $ needs to b $$ instead and salty pizza. 
Tony's pizza still tops!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house and I have always wondered about it because there is zero flair to the exterior and it's in the middle of strip mall.
But because a friend who loves NY style pizza tried and loved it I decided to take a chance.

They serve pizza by the slice and true to NY style they are huge thin crust slices that you can fold over to get it in your mouth. If you see someone take a knife and fork to it, smack them. I assume it could only add to their authentic NY experience. THen show them how to eat it properly. Fold nearly in half, insert into mouth.
If you don't like pizza, you probably got dragged here with a friend but it's okay. They serve subs and salads too.
I will definitely be back for a slice or two but hope to also try their Italian subs."}
{"text":"Very delicious and good service. Our table had the spaghetti and meatballs, calzone, Philly cheesesteak, Sicilian pizza slice, and cannolis. All was very good, but the cannolis were out of this world!"}
{"text":"Dinned here about half a dozen times and ordered out twice as many. Never disappointed, great lunch specials and amazing pizza and wings. Can't say enough good things about this neighborhood pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Everything about this pizza was great..toppings, crust, . yummy . Will definitely visit again when in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte hands down. Their antipasta salad is great and their Italian dressing we absolutely love. Their hot hoagies and and their pasta dishes are amazing.  We always order from here. You have to try it."}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from this place (14\" combo pizza, cheese, pepperoni, ham, peppers and mushrooms for $16.95) and the name could not be more accurate.  If you like thin, large slices stocked up with delicious toppings, this place is for you.  I live about 3 miles away and the delivery took about 35 minutes which wasn't bad (especially because they projected it would take 45 minutes).  After all taxes and tips it came out to $23 but for a 14\" pizza with four toppings, that really isn't bad.  

I will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings with a friendly atmosphere and great service. No fufu pizza here, just classic pizza in all its glory!"}
{"text":"It took seeing this as a REVIEW of the day to inspire me to write about this......I LOVE THIS PLACE.  Bryan introduced me to it as one of the few pizza establishments in our Park Road/Archdale subdivision that delivers!  AND IT IS GOOD!  When you are craving NY style pizza, the fact that with one phone call it comes to your door within 30 minutes, hot and greasy (just as NY Style pizza does)......is pure amazingness.  I've only tried the pizza b/c I can't get past that.  Only down side (hence the four stars) is that they are closed on Sunday and that seems to be the day that I crave it the most (damn Chick-Fil-A syndrome!)  .....lol....seriously, if you're in the neighborhood, don't be afraid to pop in and grab a slice.  It is GOOD."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for forever. I'm another New York pizza snob searching for an authentic NY slice in Charlotte. 
 Staff was friendly upon arrival. There was a lot of activity, which tends to be a good sign. I don't smell the pizza smell that weakens my knees, so I'm skeptical. 
 The service is slow for my taste. Two slices should be up quick. 15 minutes and counting... 
 I ordered 2 slices to dine in and a meatball sub to go. I got a sub on a plate that had to go back to be wrapped to go. And on slice, with the other on the way.  interesting.
 The pizza misses the mark in my book. It was fine. Not something I would stop in again for if I was craving a slice. In case you were wondering, my second slice came out 28 minutes after I ordered it."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza joint in the Queen City.  The pizza is delicious and the boneless buffalo wings are on point! When I'm in town I make it a point to stop in once or twice, usually twice."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years now and even though I don't stay on that side of town anymore I still make the trip some things have changed but the food remains good"}
{"text":"Solid pizza here, and close to my office so that's another plus.  A true NY style pizzeria and one of the few in Charlotte that offers Sicilian pie.  Lunch specials are an excellent value.  As a native long islander, I'm happy that this place is here."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in our area.   Ppl that prefer dominos or papa johns to this dont know what real pizza is."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Nice attentive service. Definitely the NY style pizza I was looking for."}
{"text":"Have seen this place time and time again, but this weekend finally went and tried it. Live near here so called the pizza in and was ready withing 15 mins. and I had to wait in line to pay, Pizza was huge and great, cheaper and better then any chain pizza!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here since the name was NY Pizza which I loved. It has defiantly changed. I ordered the lasagna (which wasn't that flavorful) and some wings which were really good. My son had a slice of cheese pizza (which they only had Sicilian slices). We went with my sisters who also ordered pizza and garlic knots. They also said that the food just isn't the same. I most likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not exactly NY style but pretty good pizza. Certainly way better than any of the chains that deliver. They don't use crumbled fake sausage, it's actually sliced. I would order from here again. I had it delivered to my hotel room and the delivery guy was nice and prompt."}
{"text":"This is my new pizza place.  True New York style and at a great price.  

Had a slice for lunch and it was perfect.  Nice, crispy crust.   Great, authentic flavor. 

The guys carried my delivery to the car, and were super nice.  

My only gripe is that the counter is super tall.  Give us short people some love.  I feel like a 6 year old buying bubble gum."}
{"text":"The wings and pizza is the best. As close to NYC pizza I'm gonna get in Charlotte !! This place is always on point."}
{"text":"The best real New York Pizza....and the meatballs....perfect!"}
{"text":"Whenever I think of NY Pizza, I think of tiny, hole-in-the-wall places that have been slinging slices for decades.  It also doesn't help that the NY Pizza I was used to in college came from this tiny place where you could barely walk through (one shoulder's width) wide for customers, but you would grab a slice and enjoy it (all techniques welcome: the fold, plate hold, tiny bites (to keep from burning the roof of your mouth), etc).  

This New York Pizza is located off of South Blvd.... plenty of places to park and it pretty clean and impressive inside.  I think the first thing that struck me were the TV's (maybe cause they were new), but you order at the counter and the pizza's come out to you, nice and hot.

Folks working here were nice and there was a steady stream of customers coming in (great sign).  We dinned in, but it looked like a lot of people called in and picked up... Not sure if they deliver... but I believe I live too far away from here to take advantage of that if they did.

Our group of 6/7 people split a salad and two pies.  Both were pretty darn amazing.  One was a pepperoni, banana pepper, and onion and the other was a sausage and mushroom pizza.  Solid crust - definitely key in delivering the toppings, sauces, and cheeses.  Looks like they also have calzones, pizza by the slice (pepperoni, cheese, some specialty), grinders, and some other items not pizza."}
{"text":"This is decent pizza and comparable to some of the better places for NY style pizza in Charlotte.

The dough is chewy but i felt the pizza was lacking in sauce and what was there wasn't very flavorful.  The pizza was covered with cheese and they also did not skimp on the pepperoni.

The restaurant itself is simple.  A few booths and some stand alone tables.  On the walls are pictures of New York and there's a couple of TV's hanging from the ceiling.  

The place is clean.  Staff was effecient but wasn't overly friendly but then again it's a pizza place.  You order, they bring it out.  You get your own drinks.  It's still a decent place."}
{"text":"This place is so good! They are fast and friendly! Co-workers have been telling me to come here for like 5 years and I finally did. I've always done take out, but they have a nice seating area. The pizza is great (New York style). Tonight I got the penne Alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs. They were both excellent! The meatballs were just a tiny bit dry, but  had a good flavor. The portions are huge and come with garlic bread. I'm so glad I gave this place a try!"}
{"text":"Delivery at a Hotel on 11/5
  Garlic Knots were some of the best I had every had - seriously good!
  Side Salad added cheese and asked for Caesar Dressing (extra) - and it was much bigger in size than I thought it would be. Lettuce was crisp & fresh.
  Got a medium pizza with Pepperoni, Onions and Sausage.  I was debating on adding banana peppers and the gal said, why not just get them on the side..it was prefect - that way they were crisp and fresh and not cooked.
  All this food and delivered for less than $29.  Great value, quick service and great food.  Cant go wrong here!"}
{"text":"From out of town with family and this was a recommended spot. Phoned in my order from the hotel to bring back and relax. 1st off, the young lady taking orders could not understand enough basic English to enter the menu choices in the point of sales computer. I repeated the order 5 times before she gave me a cost and then asked me to pay upfront. Never have I had to do that and said I'd pay when I pick up. 30 minutes later I arrive and the cashier takes my money without confirming the order. It was wrong. They seemed surprised that it was wrong when there were pie slices when I never asked for any. It took another 30 minutes for them to fix the order....and the manager insisted I pay more to make up for their error. Quality of food was just \"ok\". I won't recommend this. Bad customer service on multiple levels."}
{"text":"So this particular weekend I had a taste for a slice and since I have been back in town from NYC (Brooklyn to be exact) for about a year,  my taste bud was desperately yearning for the taste of a pepperoni slice.  Anyway, I came here to check for some reviews since my previous experiences with Pizza in town have been a mayor let down, I stumble into New York pizza reviews here on yelp and it instantly clicked in my memory that I'd visited this spot before. I checked the reviews to see if they were still good before heading out that way (it's 20 minutes from where I stay) and after reading how great this place continues to be,  I decided to come here and finally get that slice that I was craving for. All I can say is this...  They have gotten better and they are simply delicious. Don't get me wrong,  they were good before,  but unless I was in the area,  I was not making a trip at all,  but now I will certainly do so. They finally understand what NY style pizza is all about and how it should taste, fold, and also how greasy and delicious it should be.  From the cheese to the dough and the taste,  it instantly took me back home and it finally ended my pizza drought that I have been in for a year since I came back to town.  Plus,  the beef patties...  They were superb before and they are still kicking ass today and I like the fact they close at 11pm on Fridays and 10pm on Saturdays. My only two tiny complaints...  The slices are not as big Tony's.  Don't get me wrong,  it is nowhere a small size and it is big, but Tony's got them beat for a little bit in that department (to my New Yorkers read my review on this spot). Plus,  I don't like the fact they are close on Sundays.  However even with those tiny complaints,  this place is good,  delicious,  fast,  clean and simply great and it deserves the score I'm giving it.  If you want true NY style pizza and beef patties, to all my New Yorkers or anyone from the tristate this is the place to go and it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE. P. S.  THE DROUGHT IS OVER! :)"}
{"text":"Prices are getting way too high above what is listed on yelp.  I had to cancel my order when they told me $18 for a medium white pie."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while because I saw all the good reviews and the pictures looked fantastic. I came here for a to go lunch order. I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was inside. Sometimes pizza places like that are really old school. They had their menu on a tv for a nice view. 

I got the lunch special. Two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for about $4.60. I paid an extra .50 cents for each slice to add toppings to it. I got ham and beef. They don't skimp on the toppings so it's worth it! I couldn't help but also get the sicilian slice with pepperoni. Pepperoni had a good spice to it. Sicilian slice was fluffy and thick. Two regular slices were huge. I could only finish one slice. Pizza sauce was so delicious. 

I can't wait to go back. Great lunch specials and awesome food!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this pizza a 5 star but even a 2 was pushing it.  I've seen this place several times off s blvd and thought i'll try it i just wanted a slice of pizza.  I ordered the sicilian cheese pizza an garlic cheese bread, my friend ordered a salad an wings with no sauce just fried.  I had my pizza and cheese bread before he got his salad, not a good sign. It took them 10 mins plus to throw some lettece , 2 tomatoes an a few black olives on a paper plate !!!  I finished my pizza an bread before his wings came, if they were busy it would have been a different story, there were less than 5 people in the whole place. Anyhoo, back to the pizza at hand, the sicilian was just some dough and cheese thrown on top not impressed.  The wings were so small and fried hard, somebody needs to teach these folks about pizza an wings.  I wont  go back, I read somebody's comment that the service was fast I had to laugh.  Heres a little extra for you, as I walked to the bathroom i'm not sure but looked like a generator in the hallway just saying.  As I walked in the bathroom I was taken back to see the toliet with no lid, now we know us ladies dont sit on public bathrooms but i found it rather odd.  But you decide for yourself if you'd like to try this place :)"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for.  The price is great, and everything we tried was really tasty.  Cheesy bread, pizza, chicken parm sandwich, cheesecake, and lemon cake were all good.  Staff is courteous and helpful.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Chicken parm sandwich was on point. Worth the drive down South Blvd."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food! Great service and that includes dine in and take out. Their portions are huge! Me and hubby always split their salads. And the pizza is great! Love the New York style."}
{"text":"Pretty good pie, and they deliver. Luxurious. Get to sit on my fat ass while people bring me food to get fatter. Take that starving huddled masses! 'merica!!!"}
{"text":"I love pizza but NOT this pizza at this place! I recently purchased two slices of pepperoni pizza.  I took the food to go. As I was eating it I realized it tasted a little off.  Seconds after my last bite I ran to the bathroom to throw it up!  It was very alarming! Every bit of the pizza was thrown up.  My body felt better afterwards. I'm not sure what was rotten. It could have been anything from the cheese to the pepperoni. I will not be returning there."}
{"text":"This is my pizza place. I eat here at least twice a month. The prices are great and the pizza slices are giant. I get the plain cheese pizza and am happy eating just one slice. I ordered the entire pizza once and it was great too, however, I expected it to be as large as the slice of pizza, but it was not. I still go there a lot because it is so easy to eat there. Pull up, generally a spot in front of the door, despite being busy, walk in, order. The staff is always friendly and inviting. The pizza order does not take long and there is plenty of room to sit. But I generally like to take my slice home. 

They recently changed their name due to not being confused with other pizza joints with the same name. That does not change a thing for me. I am a fan and I cannot see anyone not liking this place. Well, unless you do not like their thin crust. But that can be solved by ordering the thick-style pizza crust.

In addition to pizza, this place has also desserts, sandwiches, pasta and other things. I tried their wings once at a party and they were great! This place also delivers! I cannot stop raving about this place."}
{"text":"I ordered two slices and they were bigger than my head. But more importantly they were great.  Just like you would find in the New York City area.  Great price too!"}
{"text":"There's not a lot of pizza in the Charlotte area that I would qualify as 'good' but 500 Degrees takes the cake. 

The crust is crispy but bendable as a NY pizza should be. It can get a little pricey when you start adding toppings and what not, but the portions are pretty large. 

They also have the BEST garlic knots. I'm not kidding, there's no place that I've had them where they compare to here."}
{"text":"Hello friends

I thought I'd written a review but I guess not. This time the \"New York\" pizza wasn't so \"New Yorky\" to me. There was no way I could fold the pizza the way i could with other \"New York\" pizza. It was pretty crowded. I like this place. Just caught em in a \"Non New York pizza day\" I guess. 

I'll go back

TTFN"}
{"text":"Great staff! Super friendly. My husband and I went in at 9:45 (15 min before closing) and instead of being disgruntled (as most places are) they were friendly and willing to provide great service! I only had a Sicilian slice but for going in right before closing I expected stale pizza and it was made hot and fresh! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply put, the food at this place is awful. The wife and I decided to give this place another try after the name change. We were hoping there was an ownership change as well or at least a menu and quality adjustment. So much for that thought. We ordered from here once before when it was called NY Pizza and the pizza was absolutely terrible. We ordered a large pizza this time and nothing has changed. It was the proverbial \"tasted like cardboard\". The dough/crust and sauce were just awful. I do not have a clue how this place is carrying a 4+ star rating, something is really amiss. Awful, just awful."}
{"text":"It is hard to find NY style pizza that comes close to that sold in NYC. This is pretty darn close. I was quite pleased with the quality at 500 degrees. The crust has a good chew, the cheese had a good stretch, and the sauce was decent (not quite sweet enough for me). If you are a fan of NY style pizza, you should definitely come here for a slice. They also sell personal pies and larger pies for 2 or more. They don't always sell pizza by the slice, so pay attention to the times listed on the menu. Their Sicilian pizza is magnifico! The crust is heaven (light and airy) and it has a good amount of cheesy goodness. It takes about 10 minutes for them to cook the pies/slices so it can certainly be a quick meal if you are on the go. They also sell salads, pasta, and subs, but, come on, if you are coming in for a bite, definitely grab a slice or two."}
{"text":"My family is from the tri-state area and love pizza.  I'd like to start by saying OMG!!!  This is probably the best NY style pizza we've had in twenty years.  The crust was amazing and the sauce to cheese to topping ratio was perfect.  The pizza shop is clean( including the bathrooms) and the service was wonderful.  I would highly recommend if you are in the area this is the place to get pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! It's hidden in a strip plaza just before Archdale Drive so if you're looking for it and you go past Archdale you went to far.  The pizza is obviously New York style thin crust but they also have a thicker crust if you want that, I have never tried that one. The standard thin crust pizza is very good and if you get a large it's very large. Prices are fair and on par with other pizza places around Charlotte. Plenty of seating if you want to eat in.  No complaints here, when I want pizza and I'm down that way, that's where I stop!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Awesome owner Cesar is the best!!! Really big portions... I'm addicted to their salads I know salads at a pizza joint what can I say"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst customer service I have ever experienced . After being put on hold for 13 min I decided to walk in to place my order and told the girl up at the front that I was on hold for that long. She looks at me and says \" oh I see \" no apology no I'm sorry how can I help you ?\" I get places get busy that's not what I was upset about I was upset about the stank ass attitude I was given. After telling her how poor her customer service was she said  very coldly \" I guess I'm sorry what else do you want me to say \" . I get you just work at a pizzeria but my girl no body is gonna hire you with that attitude . I was pretty excited to try this place since I'm from New York too bad that chick ruined it ."}
{"text":"I'm not from NY but have had plenty of NY style pizza and this place is as good as it gets outside of the city. 8/10 NY Style pizza. Was in town for work and got a pepperoni and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We love their margarita pizza!  Their delivery service is always fast and their food is amazing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always chuckle a little when I see someone write the next thing I'm about to say, but I'm gonna say it anyway: I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!

Their name is New York Pizza. A lot of places say that and according to people I know from New York, only a few of them actually qualify. This is one of them. Here's the thing, though. That's not my favorite thing to get here. Don't get me wrong their pizza is delicious, but I absolutely love their garlic knots! Not the bread, the knots. I don't know what they do to these things, but they're heaven on Earth. Just the right amount of fluff and crisp. Perfectly seasoned. Great complement to the marinara sauce you get with it. Just yum!

I've never been disappointed. Quick wait times both if you call in before or order once you're there. Consistently delicious food (I usually get a calzone or the penne Alfredo pasta with chicken and broccoli.) with friendly service. They even deliver, if you don't feel like driving. So glad to be acquainted with New York Pizza!"}
{"text":"OHHHHHHH Yes!!!

Literally its like Eureka several nights a month for me. Hands down the closest thing I have found to a NYC Style slice of pizza. Beware thou... they do not sell slices on Friday nights or the weekend. But they do pack an absolute punch when it comes to small dinners. They have 4 or 5 variety's of small Italian dinners for under $5.50. I often grab the lasagna with tomato sauce ( which comes with garlicky bread), but the mancotti, stuffed shells and meatballs are all delicious. 

This little joint is a hidden gem... it usually has at least half of the tables filled and a bubbly personality at the counter to help with orders. 

Sicilian Slice is decent... very decent... best I have found in Charlotte - its definitely worth the try and if your in the south Charlotte area and considering it... try it.

Before I forget.. dare I say.. they have... AUTHENTIC TIRAMISU !!!! its awesome."}
{"text":"Ok, my boyfriend and I are somewhat pizza snobs and since moving to Charlotte we've tried Fuel, Hawthorne's, Pizza Peel... all disappointments. 

New York Pizza is the best so far. Located in a strip mall on South Boulevard, it has a no-nonsense feel complete with mounted paper towel rolls and a diverse clientele. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is delicious.

Lilly's Pizza in Raleigh is still my favorite, but New York is a close second."}
{"text":"I have been hearing rave reviews from friends and have yet to been. Was over on this side town and figured it was the perfect time. We ordered buffalo wings and a large pizza with 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni and banana peppers. The pizza came out first. The crust was a slightly thicker than I find at other NY style places but this made it nice and crispy and it held up, so if you like your pizza loaded this crust can handle. The cheese was fresh and full of flavor, sauce was perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet and a good ratio of sauce to cheese. While the pizza was excellent hot and fresh from the over, I enjoyed it even more after it sat in the fridge at home. The wings came out next, they were super hot and smothered in spicy buffalo sauce. They were cooked to perfection, nice and crispy even with the sauce all over it. I would recommend checking this place out for sure, they had a good menu variety with sandwiches, calzones and Italian dishes so there is something for everybody. I have a chicken parm or meatball sub in my future!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. We just moved here from Chicago and my husband loves New York style pizza. Authentic NYC style, perfect crust, wonderful service and addictive flavor. Serves pizza by the slice and pasta dishes. Daily specials. Will be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great wings.  If you are a true NYC pizza fan you will find the this is the closest you will get in Charlotte.  They even have the napkins ready for those that want to remove some of the grease from the pizza."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best pizza IN THE WORLD. I've traveled Europe this summer. Had pizza in Italy it honestly was not as good as this pizza. Even the pizza in NYC was not as good. This is the best pizza out there."}
{"text":"Although the service was nice, restaurant was clean, everything was just okay. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a side salad. The salad was large & fresh, however the ranch dressing was right out a store bought jar. As for the pizza, it was served hot, but the crust was a little hard & like the ranch, the pepperoni tasted like those pepperoni's bought in the bag at the grocery store. I ended up picking those off & enjoyed basically a cheese pizza. Unfortunately it didn't meet up to Tony's, still my favorite New York Style Pizza!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza,  Thin and Thick.

I have had the pizza here a couple times and it does a good job.  I would not say it is world-class pizza, but it is head and tail better then the next closest offering. 

The NY pizza is thin and bendy as it needs to be. 

The Thick Sicilian is properly thick, and will filled up your stomach with delicious carbs. The crust is just normal flavored. 

Double check the prices before you order, as what is listed on Yelp does not match up at all.

I can't wait to try their subs as I am hearing very good things."}
{"text":"With a name like New York pizza, you would expect the pizza to be New York style and that it is. It's thin and it's large and its cheesy and it's very very good. But I think that it's not as good as Luigi's on South Tryon. Yes, they have stuff other than pizza but with this name why would you have anything else?

Excellent pricing - two slices for just under $5.

Typical pizza joint with some booths and tables and you can see the kitchen areas clearly. TV on the wall tuned to a sports channel."}
{"text":"5 stars!... solely because it's honestly the closest to true NY pizza in Charlotte (far and away). I've lived in Westchester and Fairfield county all my life (until a year ago) and I've tried the rest... this is the only pizza in CLT I look forward to eating. Enough said!"}
{"text":"1st tome eating here, from out of town. Good hot wings, cheese steak awesome, pizza amazing! The pizza was a little salty but could've been my choice of toppings. Definitely recommend great food!"}
{"text":"The older lady at the front does not have good customer service at all. The pizza tastes frozen and does not taste like New York pizza at all. The pizza state like the pizza I use to eat in elementary school. The rest of the items are salty. Me and my family came here and no one likes the pizza or the beef patty. The wings are ok. The location lacks customer service and only caters to specific individuals and does not care about if \"they\" mess up your order they will not give you your money back. I never heard of that, especially it is is the restaurants fault. They do not have any type of reward program or any incentives to keep there customers coming back. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! If you want something special and not expensive that's the right place for pizza!! We all know what is a good pizza but after you try it out you will come back again and again.."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Charlotte.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE!  They Do it right. Great owner and operator."}
{"text":"Very casual place, walk up ordering and self service seating. Call ahead if you want a shorter wait time because it sure does get busy! 

My absolute favorite pizza place in Charlotte. They always load my pizza with the best toppings. I firmly believe a great pizza is made of great sauce, amazing crust and the perfect topping to pizza ratio. The cheese is extra cheesy as it should be and you can see the strings when you bite into it. 

Top 3 things I enjoy, spaghetti parmesan, grandma pizza, and I create my own loaded with pineapple. .

I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I've been going here for YEARS, they have an awesome lunch special. $4.60 for a drink and two slices of cheese pizza. The slices are huge! Their stromboli's are also delicious. They have recently changed their name on the glass windows to \"500 degrees pizza\" but the original sign remains on the building."}
{"text":"There are certain things you're never going to find \"excellent\" in Charlotte and instead you have to settle for \"good enough\".  New York style pizza is one of those things.  This joint is one of the better places (along with Luigi's) and lets you indulge in your slice fix as best as you can in the South.

It's got everything you're looking for in a NYC pizza place: big ass slices, the need to dab the top with napkins, and reasonable prices.  They even deliver which puts them a notch above Luigi's in my opinion.

Is the the best NYC pizza I've ever had in my life, no.  Is it damn good for the Queen City, yes."}
{"text":"Tried chicken parm and it was tasty. Love the meat sauce on the spaghetti and garlic bread dipped in it is so good. Pizza was nice too. The place stayed busy with all types of clientele and items from the entire menu being ordered. Total win."}
{"text":"When you feel like you have tried almost every pizza place in Charlotte, i swear i have never heard of this place until someone told me about it. Bragged about how good everything here was so i decided to see what the hype was all about. We ordered a supreme pizza and lemon pepper wings. The crust was super crunchy how i like it, and the slices mimicked the new york style pizza which i loved. The wings hit the spot as well. Excited to try some other dishes they have here for i see online they sale a little bit of everything!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since the name change. I was in the mood for some pizza slices and not the whole pie which is prevalent at pizza joints around town. The last time I ate here I wasn't impressed with the pizza, but my daughter and I fought over their garlic knots.

Anyone who describes this pizza as New York style must from the most rural parts of the state. It's just way too crispy to be NY style. Maybe this should be Charlotte style pizza. I was starving, so I ate both slices I ordered. What can I say, I love pizza so I'm going to make the best of what's put in front of me. 

The garlic knots were better than the pizza. They were pretty large and fluffy, more like a small dinner roll size than a knot. It wasn't the way I remembered, but it was good.

I'm happy for those that are satisfied with this place- but when it comes to NY style slices, they miss the target."}
