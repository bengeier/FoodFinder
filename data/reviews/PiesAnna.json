{"text":"EXCELLENT!  Ate at PiesAnna yesterday and was fortunate to try at least 12 varieties of their pies.  I discovered PiesAnna because a relative has hired the restaurant to cater their wedding. Yesterday, we were fortunate enough to experience an amazing taste test.  The team at PiesAnna pulled out all the stops for us and the pie was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  We also tried a roast beef with potatoes and vegetable medley, the vegetables were cooked 'al dente' to perfection and the roast beef was melt in your mouth delicious - everything home made and delicious - how many times have a stated DELICIOUS!!.  The PiesAnna staff were so helpful and friendly-the experience was just like eating in your own kitchen.  I live on the South Shore, but when I feel like a good home cooked meal, without the fuss of doing it myself, I am going to venture across the bridge from now on, and we all know with our Montreal roads and constant construction....still worth the trip!!  Thanks PiesAnna gang!!"}

{"text":"PIE-YIYI Delicious!!!!  My first excursion with fellow Yelper and we first came to pick up Pie because they closed earlier than our dinner place, and I am super super happy we did so.   When it comes to making a decision about which pie to get when presented with choice, we realized that we should just go with a slice of each (oh yes we did)  We chose:  2 slices of their strawberry cheesecake pie 2 slices of pumpkin 1 slice of blueberry 1 slice of apple  Here's what we know (Anna herself told us about her pies):  - No preservatives - Real Fruit - No canned crap - Fresh  On the plus side, quick customization of your pie! No need for a day of turnaround, place your pie order in and 2 hours later you get fresh pie!!  Personally, I think of all the pies I tried, her strawberry cheesecake was heavenly. It literally made my night!!! (and the next days).  It's not dense, it's a nice light pie, with delicious graham cracker pie crust (attention crust lovers, she goes all out on this) and the part that made me love it more is tying it in with a bit of salt! Which I personally love (we're not talking like salted like savoury) Trust me, get this, I don't even usually like fruit sauce on my cheesecake, and now this will become a definite!!! Blueberry was good because you can tell its made from real blueberries! Pumpkin was lightly spiced, I personally like a good spicy pumpkin pie, but hers was really good because it was smooth and a good taste of pumpkin. I always love apple, but it's nice cause she lets each pie's fruit speak for itself.  Now presentation wise, you don't get that whole, \"omg I bought this from a 5 star bakery and its so pretty I dont want to eat it,\" but for the taste and the price, and knowing its the closest non-manufactured pie you can get to pulling it out of your own oven, it's amazing.  So Pie-people, go get some, its worth it, and it's my new pie place to go!"}
