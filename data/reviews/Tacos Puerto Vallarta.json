{"text":"It was fantastic and inexpensive.  Very authentic and friendly staff. My wife and kids also loved it. The favors were exactly like the food we had in Puerto Vallarta."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and good vibes the whole time. Food was flavorful and well priced. Great selection of drinks including many Mexican beers."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this restaurant, decided Cinco De Mayo was a great day to try it. Had to wait for a table, for drinks, and service, and even ordered our meal once, and then they got confused and needed to order it again after they misplaced our order. 2 wait staff on a busy day is not enough. However, the food more than made up for it, great taste, great drinks, have to say it was worth the wait and we will be returning customers. Just not on a major Mexican holiday."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place for you.  From the outside it looks a little rough, and you could forgive someone for passing by based on the \"neighbourhood\" but as a regular visitor to Mexico this is just part of the Authenticity.  The prices are incredibly reasonable, in fact when the bill came we double checked because we figured they must have missed something.  The food..... the food is incredible and like I said as Authentic as it gets.  I am lucky enough to live in Airdrie but would say this place is worth the drive from surrounding areas if you want the real deal."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC and delicious. Staff is lovely and aimes to please. Order the enchaladas Verde."}
{"text":"Authentic tacos~ I put each of the 3 types of salsa dips in my tacos to make it more flavorful/spicy for me! Love horchata, but ask for little ice..or else you'll finish the drink within seconds. Margarita is bland. Tres leches cake is a MUST..so moist!!!! Even if you're full, order it to go!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and very helpful. The food is authentic and delicious. Their desert menu only has 3 items but its more than enough as the choice are great. They're very accommodating to people with different food allergies or preferences."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food---worth getting off the highway for. Delicious carnitas and horchata. Guacamole that restored my faith in this most popular--but far too often ordinary--of dips. I would love to see this place constantly full."}
{"text":"Don't judge from the outside. Friendly staff great food. Best Mexican in airdrie by far."}
{"text":"Place is now called Tequila & Taco

It beyond boring flavours don't give you the Mexican experience 

Flautas No flavour next to no sour cream & cheese 

Sopa Aztec water down tomato soup that tasted like vegetable broth far to many chip

Guacamole was excellent salas was tasty & hot

Won't be back"}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough! Fabulous food, great staff. My new favourite restaurant in Airdrie."}
{"text":"Ok. Those fast food Mexican restaurants can kiss my habanero. 

What's going on in Airdrie? The food scene is starting to get rather respectable here. Goto love it. 

Now. This place is the real deal with amazing home made not from a can Mexican food!! Both our dishes were as good as we have ever had and this includes eating in Mexico. 

I love these small out of the way places who's owners really care and have pride in what they are doing. This is one of those places. So please, don't pass this place by... U won't regret it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing , best Mexican I've had north of Mexico!!  Hard working, friendly and authentic. Can't wait to go back. May have to go bi-weekly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican in Alberta. My favourite is the enchilada verde."}
{"text":"Went in after a friend said how good it was. Authentic Mexican food served by great people. Had chicken tacos, and they were just like my last trip south. 

A true diamond in the rough. Don't let the hotel scare you away!  I talked to an inspector that I work with, he confirmed the kitchen is very clean!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered food for pick up.lady on the the phone says half an hour so we got there on time..food was cold and super dry. We ordered pastor tacos,chuleta, chorizo, quesdillas with queso and enchiladas.paid $44 for a garbage food."}
{"text":"Dank dank tacos for a reasonable amount of your hard earned shekels. This place is DOPE! Recommend the carnitas, I just can't stop eating them. Can't say I have had anything bad off of the menu yet. This is real Mexican food folks, get here before the wall!"}
{"text":"One of the best place I've eaten in Airdrie so far, authentic home cooked yumminess! I'll always be stopping by for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Very authentic!  Service was fast.  We asked to take our food out.  It was no problem.  We will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Love to come eat here. We are from further away and every time we come this way we make sure to eat here. Very authentic and tasty. You definitely need to give it a try!  The outside does look rough but as soon as you walk in it has great atmosphere, music, and the staff is excellent!!  The chilaquiles are my favorite and the tacos de carnitas!"}
{"text":"The salsa was excellent. I really enjoyed my enmoladas. Definitely an authentic Mexican menu. Great service!"}
{"text":"I have gone a few times with my uncle. Each time I tried something different and I've never been disappointed. 
I've always enjoyed the food and service."}
{"text":"I read a few reviews about this place before, and they were mixed, let me shed some light. I lived in Houston TX for nearly 3 years, and being a Latino myself I was a frequent patron on all nearby Mexican restaurants. The food is simply great. It has that home made flavour that you cannot find on Taco Bell, or even on that fashionista mexican restaurant in downtown. Food is fresh, tasty, and the cook and owner are Mexican... so they know their stuff. In another review I read a guy complaining about the red sauce. Well, this is not your typical Mexican red sauce from Old El Paso, this is a Chile de Arbol Salsa, honestly, I've never tried it before and it was shocking when I tasted it, as I was expecting the regular bland red salsa. But once I learned it was a different salsa, I gave it a second try and I loved it. It has an aged, strong flavour that will make you think of tequila or vodka. Better if you have it with the food, as will be very dominant with tortillas alone. My partner ordered Tacos Dorados (chicken) and she was in love with them (and she is very hard to impress). I ordered Tacos de Costilla (beef) and although the presentation wasn't great, I'm still craving them the day after. Yes, the portions are a bit small, yes, there are kids jumping around, yes, the presentation is not very elaborated, but what the heck... it doesn't get more authentic mexican than this. Even if you go to mexico every 2 months, don't think that the food they serve over there is authentic.... is just tourist approved. Tacos Puerto Vallarta is probably the best authentic mexican food I've tasted in the last 10 years."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food and atmosphere. The owners are genuinely sweet. Try it for yourself. Support this local business and these lovely people!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic, superb service! We came here with our family of 5 for lunch and were blown away. We live in Calgary but this is our new Mexican restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"They changed the menu and possibly owners. They still have G Free options but I left feeling disappointed. It wasn't as amazing as I remember."}
{"text":"Don't judge from the outside. This is one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in the Calgary area. The waitress was so nice, the food comes fast and was so delicious. If your looking for good Mexican food I definitely recommend this place. I have nothing bad to say except the outside does look a little iffy but it's totally worth it!"}
