{"text":"The place was busy on. Saturday night ..there were two wedding receptions and maybe they have staffed more but who knows ...maybe they have to watch their HPPT...if you are reading this you no idea what I am talking about"}
{"text":"Long day and the celebration haven't even begun. I dropped my bag off and went to the hotel for a drink and a bite to eat. The bartender was really friendly and checked on me frequently. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it wasn't to bad. For my meal I ordered the Pittsburgh salad with salmon for $18. I must say this salad was huge it was loaded with eggs,salmon and fries . This isn't bad for a hotel restaurant"}
{"text":"As we were staying here at the Marriott we decided to have burgers at \"Burger City\" at the Regatta Bar & Grill. When you call yourself a burger place you should first have good burgers. The patties seemed to be premade, probably frozen, they were identical. I asked for mine med well the other requested med rare, the were both cook well done. I ordered mine topped with an egg which are normally served over easy or sunny side up so that the yolk runs over the burger. The egg on mine was cooked over hard, the yolk was just a firm lump. The French fries were limp and soggy. I'd suggest that if you eat here, try something other than a burger..."}
{"text":"This is the hotel bar/restaurant at the Marriott.  It's right in the lobby.  I've been here a few times; it's OK.  They have your typical \"TGI Friday's\" type of menu except everything is more expensive.  My biggest gripe about this place is that it is always packed (at least the times I've been there) and you can't always get a seat or a table.  Maybe I just have bad timing but on my most recent visit, I wanted to grab a quick dinner and not leave the hotel but was unable to do so.  Being popular isn't the place's fault but it stinks when you can't eat here.  The food I've had has just been OK."}
