{"text":"While Karpaty has a good selection of deli meats and other foodstuffs, I come here for the cheap frozen pierogies, which come in a number of different varieties. There's the usual potato and cheddar kind, as well as potato and cottage cheese (although you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference if they're mixed together); you can also get savory pierogies, like meat or blueberry.

The last time I picked some up, I also got some sour cream to go with them, since I had run out at home. I didn't need too much, so I got the small-sized Sealtest tub; but in retrospect, it's advisable to get the big Polish-brand sour cream, which is a much better value."}
{"text":"a hidden gem in bwv.  hear me though, there's no bells and whistles here, strictly cheap and cheerful.  that said, the next time you don't want to cook, stop here for some eastern euro comfort food.  never met a karpaty hot table food item i didn't love."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for frozen pierogies and kopytka (sometimes called paluszki in Polish; it's sort of like gnocchi). They ship these in by the hundred and have a constantly stocked freezer full of them for a couple bucks each in tons of flavours - potato and cheese, cottage cheese, cheese only, blueberry, plum, meat, etc. SO GOOD!!

Make sure you try the kopytka. They're superb and hard to come by elsewhere in Bloor West Village!!

Closed on Sundays."}
