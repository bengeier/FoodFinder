{"text":"Such a cute place right in Strongsville! There were so many types of tea that were all reasonably priced at $4 per pot plus free refills of the pot. The menu was smaller yet had decent options however I was disappointed that they didn't have more vegan options. A decent amount of vegetarian but not very many vegan other than one or two salads. Still, phenomenal tea and the desserts looked wonderful although my friend and I didn't have any. The decor and ambiance was so pleasant and the servers and manager were dressed up in fancy old time-y dresses with lace and hats... adorable! A very nice place to sit and talk with a friend or many friend(s), just make sure to make a reservation with a bigger party! Will definitely be coming back with my grandmas"}
{"text":"Miss Hickory's Tea Room is simply fantastic. From the moment my group of 5 walked in we felt right at home. Everything was fabulous, not one complaint from anyone. We all had the soup special of the day: cauliflower soup with white cheddar cheese. It was amazing!!! Four out of five of us had the spinach quiche and that was amazing as well, I just wish it could have been a little warmer. We also tried the finger sandwich tower to split between us and those were spectacular as well. Also, the mac n cheese is simply to die for. 

When it comes to the tea it was nothing really that special, just a simple every day Twining's English Breakfast that I could get anywhere. When I got to tea rooms I am looking for an exotic black tea that I have never tried before. Even still the tea was good, but the hot water could have been much warmer. We were there for two hours and the tea was cold 30 minutes in. 

The desserts, however, were spectacular. The signature chocolate cake with edible lace doily on top was beautifully crafted and tasted like something out of this world. The scones of the day were great as well. Cranberry orange Yum!

Over all this Tea Room is amazing and we will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't written a review on this place yet!  Oops...  so I went to Miss Hickory's with The Wife, The Kid and her parents for Mother's day a while back.  We booked reservations way in advance- which is good because it was pretty crowded.  I'm not really much of a high tea person but I enjoyed most of this visit.  What I loved most was the scones.  Warm, perfectly tender- these are probably the best scones that I've had.  And I don't really like scones, but if they were all like this, I probably would.  The chicken noodle soup thing was ok- nothing mind blowing.  Most of the little snacks from the tea platter were pleasant.  The waitress was very attentive.  My daughter enjoyed having books to read.  We enjoyed my wife's tea and purchased some loose leaf to bring home.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.  Would come back for a special occasion or maybe just get some scones for take out."}
{"text":"So charming! I've never done anything like this before! I came with a group of ladies for my friend's Bachelorette Party. We each got our own little pot of tea, and the china was so cute! I was never really into playing tea party when I was a little girl, but this was so fun! Our servers were wonderful and patient, since none of us had ever visited before. They explained all the different types of tea and answered all of our questions. I know it's August, but I ordered the pumpkin spice tea. It was so yummy and got me in the mood for fall! Our party also got little samplers of sandwiches, fruit, and desserts. The chicken salad was amazing and I think my favorite treat was the scone. It was cinnamon and was perfect for dipping into my tea! I am not from the area so I doubt I will ever be able to come back to this place, but I highly recommend it for a fun afternoon!"}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time after patiently awaiting their grand opening.  Wonderful experience...food, atmosphere, and service were all outstanding!  Tucked away on a winding road...beautiful setting...the back deck is lovely as is the entire tea room. I look forward to many visits to this gem!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a more charming place. It's hard to call it a restaurant because it's so much more. We were there to celebrate my aunts 89th birthday. There was 5 of us and some had quiche and I had tuna on a croissant and another had chicken salad and everything was delicious. Of course we all had tea. Which was also delicious. Just go!!"}
{"text":"Every year around the holidays, we do a girls day that includes tea. Miss Hickory's was the third tea room we've been to since starting this tradition. We went after Christmas this year due time off only after the holidays. We made a reservation near the end of lunch, and some of our party was a little late. The server didn't come over right away, and when we did, she didn't bring menus. After we asked for them, service was back on track.

We each ordered a different pot of tea, and I went with a holiday black tea. It was pretty good, but the most fun is drinking out of dainty floral tea cups with saucers. Their menu is fairly similar to other tea rooms; however, I really liked that their menu included an option to choose three items. So, I went with the chicken stew with spaetzels, which is available regularly, chicken salad on a croissant, and strawberry pretzel salad. It was the perfect amount of food to feel satisfied and try a few different things from the menu. Everything was extremely tasty!

After lunch, we were one of the last parties in the place, but they were patient enough to let us walk upstairs and scope out the charming Victorian decor in each of the bedrooms, which is one of the best parts of a tea room. 

Overall, we all thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Miss Hickory's and will surely be back for next year's annual girls holiday tea!"}
{"text":"I would've given it 5 stars, but...
1. We didn't have a reservation, but owner \"squeezed\" is in; said our table was needed by 1:15 (it was 11:45) to clean for a 1:30;
2. She kept checking on us to see that things were \"moving along\"; not our fault took a while to get food!
3. Around 1:05, server told us to relax; they placed the group at another table;
4. At 1:15, owner comes and tells us she needs our table; we didn't have our check yet!
5. 1:20, server brings check but asks us if we want dessert!!!
6. Owner comes back again.
7. Please!!!! I believe she needed table for new group, not the original 1:30;
8. Also, something needs to be done about the parking!! Lot way too small. As I understand it, the land to right of lot owned by her as well."}
{"text":"The Tea Room was fabulous. We had the best time. The ladies running the place are terrific the food was amazing. I would say go and experience. You will love it"}
