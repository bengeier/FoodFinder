{"text":"Food is always fresh and delicious. I dont have to worry about this cook or that cook its all the same, delicious mexican food. I LOVE their pork Torta and get it every time! The green sauce is the best in town too full of ACTUAL sauce and flavor!"}
{"text":"the absolute BEST mexican food in the area! always come here when i land its a must! every other place you have to be careful about, this place 100% authentic! AMAZING GREAT yumm!!"}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place! I've been going to Don Panchos for over 10 years and they never disappoint. I'm always satisfied. They will always be my #1 go to for Mexican food. They have so much variety so you can't go wrong here. It will please any Mexican food craving you got."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada burritos meat was burned more rice and beans then meat, meat seemed to only be in front and back of burrito not in the middle hardly any sour creme loud music. Not much flavor in the salsas."}
{"text":"Well i found this restaurant on yelp, decided to give it a chance. Well let me say this my friends this place is for reals,  taste just mother's cooking. Great presentation, right amount of food and the frijoles (beans) were to die for. Love it and will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is DEEELLLISHHHHH!!! I can never get tired of eating at this restaurant. While you wait for your food, they bring you a small plate of chips with beans on top. Their beans are amazing. The quesadillas also taste delicious and so do their tacos. My brother gets the tortas and he loves them. The only thing that I have tried from this place that I wasn't crazy about was their menudo."}
{"text":"favorite place to eat the food is so authentic, the carne asada burrito is really good its wrapped in a very fluffy hand made tortilla. Their pozole is my personal favorite so delicious it makes your taste buds go crazy first time i tried it i went home and told my family now its our go to place after church and have recommened all of my friends to go and they all have loved it!"}
{"text":"Authentic, always Excellent, friendly service.  There are bigger and fancier places in The Valley, but none are better."}
{"text":"Ordered a green chile burrito, menudo and horchata all for around 12 bucks. Given an appetizer without asking. May have been just chips and beans but the act was thoughtful. Go to this place today!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Great tacos, quesadillas de maiz (sooooo goood!), burritos, sopes, tortas.... the list is endless."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and it didn't disappoint. Food was delicious and prices are fair. Tasted quite a different items: al pastor/adobada burrito, cabeza, carne asada, and chicharon tacos. The winner was definitely the Al Pastor meat. It was pcked with flavor and really reminded me of the flavor you would get in Mexico City. 

Dont be afraid of the looks, its a hole in the wall but more like a local and humble restaurant. Service was friendly and they also have pan dulce. 

I will definitely be back for the el pastor"}
{"text":"Really good food! The pozloe and tortas are my favorite, but the carne asada tacos are pretty amazing too. You can also go on eat24.com and place your order online and it will be ready for you to pick up shortly after your arrival.

The salsa bar here is small but delicious, and the pickled veggies are to die for. I'd run off with the whole tray if they let me!

This place isn't in the best area but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Don Panchos Taqueria is the sole reason why I am addicted to tortas. This place is beyond delicious and is the best Mexican food joint I have ever had to the pleasure to eat at to this day. I have been visiting this place for over nine years. They not only have a salsa bar, they have a vegtable bar where you can load up on unlimited carrots, cucumber, lemons, oniions ect. The service is always welcoming and genuinely friendly. I have a little place in my heart for Don Panchos Taqueria, I would urge anyone to take the trip and enjoy this amazing little place :) The restaurant is pretty hood, but that is the least of it once you try it! Your mouth will consistantly water for it.. :)"}
{"text":"Pancho Taqueria is awesome. Not only was there food very good, their service was incredible. I really wish I had the name of the guy working the register because he was remarkably friendly and helpful. If this place was located closer to my house, I would probably be a regular. 

Okay, so I tried a carne asada torta, a tripas taco and a couple bites of the al pastor. The torta was on par with some of the better tortas I've had in the past. I can't compare it to Los Reyes or anything because it's simply carne asada, salad and sauce (unlike the craziness at Los Reyes), but I can say, \"Wow!\" I've always wanted to be more adventurous with tacos so I got tripas. DON'T GET TRIPAS! Haha! Not Pancho's fault, but mine. I've come to the realization that I don't like fried bone marrow on my tacos. And, as far as the al pastor, it was good, but not authentic according to my girlfriend. One day we will find authentic al pastor in Phoenix. One day...

If you're in on the west side during the day and want some cheap and delicious Mexican food, give Pancho Taqueria a shot. It's good."}
{"text":"Came here to have breakfast before going to church and I'm truly overall disappointed with this place. First they didn't have what I wanted. Then I ordered an egg and ham burrito so I can just eat the inside because I'm on a special diet. What I got was mostly potatoes with an over cooked egg, and ham. Needless to say that most of the food went to waste because I can't eat potatoes. I would have taken it back and asked for them to remake it but it took so long to get our food that I would be late for church if I waited."}
{"text":"Gotta day the yelp community let me down with this one no idea how this place has anywhere near the amount of stars it does. Ordered a California burrito definitely one of the worst I've had. Firstly this use pieces of potato instead of French fries. Second had to pay extra to add guac & sour cream & the size of it was pathetic. Get home un wrap it only to see that the whole burrito was split open from the top and I take my first bite took the foil off the bottom only to see the bottom had already completely caved in & I had to finish eating with a knife & fork. What a same. The carne Asada was pretty flavorful that's the only positive things I have to stay. My brother also ordered & gave his burrito a 2.5/5 stars. Definitely save your time & money and go else where."}
{"text":"Nothing Fancy Just Good Food

I was searching  for a new Mexican Food restaurant when I came across Taqueria Don Pancho.  I have to admit, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The service  was great, and the food was delicious.

On this visit I had a chili relleno combo platter. The combo dinner included refried beans, which were some of the best refried beans I've eaten in a very long time, and the Relleno was perfectly prepared with fresh  green chile, not canned or frozen.

The salsa bar offers various salsas,  green and red sauces, both equally good tasting. If you're looking for great tasting mexican food stop by, you weonr be disappointed. Great Food, nice size portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant for 2 years and it's still consistent. Because me and my honey moved further away we don't visit as much but when we do they remember who we are. The food no matter what we've ordered never disappoint. Hands down our favorite spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic, and inexpensive Mexican food! A must in you are in the neighborhood. I'm a huge fan of the cabeza and lengua taxis, as well as all soups!"}
{"text":"Late night burritos never tasted this good. The carne asada, El Pastor, or the Chicken are my favorite to to choose from."}
{"text":"This is close to home and the best Latin food I have ever tasted in my life as a African American woman. They not only have good customer service with an inviting environment but every single thing I have tried on the menu is beyond my expectations. From the pazole to asada burritos to the carnitas. Today reason I'm commented was because I ordered 3 beef menu chimi and it made me happy once again the chimmis are not pre rolled and stuffed they stuff and roll them by hand and fry it when I say the best freaking chimmis I have had in history. In the area I suggest you stop on by seriously"}
{"text":"I tried the fish tacos, my go to food any new place I go.  Tasted pretty good, but nothing fancy, a piece of deep fried breaded fish chopped up and divided among the 4 tacos.  A bit pricey at 3 bucks each. They were missing cilantro, cabbage and a good sauce.  The place was nice and clean, a bit dated, but there was also a fresh veggie and salsa bar that you can get for your food, it was cool and refreshing with good flavors. The soda drinks are a bit pricey at well over 2 bucks and refills are not much better at a dollar, the size is medium. The side of rice for 2 bucks was nothing fancy, was a bit on the soft side, but had good flavor.  I liked the chips with refried beans and a type of mexican cheese \"al fresco?\" that they give you \"free\" when you place an order, they were fresh and tasty. Although I would go here again, I will try some other foods, the fish tacos will be saved for another place."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast burritos. My favorite place to go and the employees are awesome. I would recommend to anyone who like authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Muy rica comida y atención también en verdad es recomendable,las quesadillas de maíz,los chilaquiles sin olvidar su salsa bar"}
{"text":"Awsome !! My wife and I wondered into this fine 
Cantina.. 
   We are so happy , and full... thanks don!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews from Faith and Thomas, I decided to stop by at this place because it's really close by to my pad. 
I was greeted by a guy when I walked in and he showed some of their display of meals. He was very helpful as to answer my questions for descriptions of their food. 
I decided to order the Family Meal of 20 taquitos that came with beans, rice, chips and salsa. Also orders carne asada burrito and horchata. The horchata was just okay, it wasn't bad, just not the best that I've had. The taquitos were alright, but if you add on the lime and hot sauce...it's delicious! The beans were a bit salty, but good. The rice was just wonderful. The burrito was great and they put a good amount of carne asada in the filling. 
I really wanted to try their panderia section, but I came here for dinner and decided that I should just visit next time in the morning when it's more fresh, but I must admit, when someone passed by with their tray of pastries...oh man...was I tempted! It smelled so GOOD!!!
Overall, a great experience and would definitely come by again!"}
{"text":"A delicious serving of Hangover Helper!

Great spot once again.
Had 2 Carnitas Tacos, and 2 Pastor tacos.  Those were the highlight.
Also had the Quesadilla de Maiz again de Carne Asada (wish it didn't have lettuce).
And a chicken burrito.

The pork is insane.
Kinda rough inside, but great food."}
{"text":"Really does it!!! Authentic Mexican food! Reasonable prices ! I had he carne asada burrito with everything. Most of the time it's evenly spread with the ingredients. But if you want one more than the other you can just tell them and the lady's will do it. So kind! Ladies can cook back there."}
{"text":"The place I have been looking for!!! New to area my new go to spot. Asada fresh with good grilled cooked flavor."}
