{"text":"One of the coolest coffee houses in the Madison area! Always fresh, clean and full of great bakery. I have tried the sandwitches as well and they do not disapoint....... chocolate chip cookies are amazing!"}
{"text":"Favorite Madison yarn store since lakeside went downhill and then out of business. Just wish they had a east side Madison yarn cafe like this."}
{"text":"It is a cute little place with very friendly staff; however, I went there on three different occasions and was disappointed with the quality of the food. I tried the cheddar and broccoli quiche which was terribly bland (no salt and pepper or nutmeg, no noticeable cheese or broccoli flavor, just bland egg and dough). Another time I had the grilled cheese sandwich - same problem, bland and greasy. If they improved their food, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"As others have said, this is a really charming and friendly place!

It is not fancy, by any means:instead, its charm is that it makes you feel at home. While the furniture is simple and unmatched, the selection of yarns is outstanding and of high quality. (But their prices are reasonable and are less than some competitors.) 

I have been coming here for years to attend knitting/crochet classes, to browse among the yarns and patterns, and to sip coffee while spending a few hours crocheting. It is a great place to discuss your project with others.

There are many patrons who come just to talk over a beverage or a light meal. There are others who just come for a carryout coffee (and are obviously well-known to the barista). 

 While I really like most all of the Ancora coffee drinks, I do not care that much for their tea. The Chai tea was overburdened by vanilla and the Early Gray did not taste like it contained bergamot. I would be willing to pay the same price for a more mundane tea, just to have a place to \"knit and sip,\"

Thanks for being such a wonderful space and refuge for those of us who love to knit and crochet!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The service is always great and it has a wonderful atmosphere.  My husband loves the frozen low carb mocha drink- he says no where else in the Madison area has anything close to it.  The only slightly negative thing I have to say is the coffee they serve is sometimes a little strange.  I am usually up for trying new flavors, but sometimes I just want a plain cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Cute little niche. I think the seating could be a little better. I think it can get a little crowded in the winter when there isn't as much fresh air. Great selection of yarn if you are interested. Prices are slighting higher but if you are used to Starbucks this should be no surprise, and I promise it will be more genuine, homespun, local and equally delicious coffee or other beverages."}
{"text":"Love the variety of coffee blends! Incredible. Seats are too hard for my liking though...great knitting assistance!"}
{"text":"Great place. I was in town for the Ironman. I decided to explore the area near the bike course. Great selection of yarn, comfortable and interesting house-like atmosphere, great coffee and food. I bought some Peace Fleece and they did some calculations for me to make sure I would have enough. The people who worked there were very friendly and helpful, but not pushy or overbearing. And they had a nice selection of books and Madelinetosh."}
{"text":"When visiting the Verona area, I was looking for a hometown coffee shop that served good coffee, had a relaxing atmosphere, and served breakfast and lunch.  I was very pleased to find The Sow's Ear. I enjoyed one of their Fair Trade coffee options and ordered the Sowfait (vanilla yogurt and cherry granola bowl).  Coffee and food were excellent. The staff associates were very pleasant and the service was fast.   I'll definitely be returning again to The Sow's Ear while I'm in the Verona/Madison area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite yarn shop in the area! Everyone working there is friendly and knowledgable, and their selection is great.  Yes, the yarn is higher end than what you would find at JoAnn Fabrics or Micheals, but I have found some of the coolest yarns there and I believe they are worth spending a little bit more.  It also is a local yarn shop so I feel better about spending a little bit more money there. 

I've also taken a couple of classes there and those were great as well.  Helpful teachers and instructors. 

Also, they have delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Interesting place because the coffee shop really is there to support knitters! 

My wife wanted to stop there to see why a couple of her friends raved about the place. Since I am knot into knitting (and probably might stab myself) I will not rate their raison d'etre. 

I had a mocha cappuccino. Very good & rich. Reasonably priced. My wife had an Italian soda. 

Supposedly they carry what is considered to be a very good brand of coffee. 

My wife had an almond scone. I tasted it. Better than most I have tasted. 

I had a tuna on warm baguette. I thought it very good. It comes with some nice greens and a delicate dressing. Also very good. About $7.00 if I remember correctly. 

I number of women were there, knitting away, having fun. A warm and cozy shop. Friendly staff. 

All this made for a relaxing lunch. 

As you can tell from the name, porcine figurines and items are a focus."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite LYS. They have an incredible selection, including lots of Noro (my favorite brand, it's Japanese and not many places carry it). You can shop for a new project and then get started on it right there while you sip on a delicious soy latte. Also, the proprietor and staff are extremely friendly and SO helpful. We only come into town once a year and always make sure to stop by when we do."}
{"text":"I'm not a big coffee drinker but the not coffee selection is delightful! The baristas are also very helpful and incredibly nice! I enjoy the atmosphere in the building. And if you are into any and all things yarn this is a excellent spot for that as well."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop I enjoyed a cup of the day's medium roast  \"Black Purl\". The staff was very friendly and fast. I have a thing for little coffee shops in old houses. There's a shopping area of some sort in the back, looked like it had fun gifts. Tip: They are open later than the other coffee shop across the street!"}
{"text":"Good concept -- coffee and knitting! Love that combination. The staff is very friendly, both the baristas and the knitters (are they both?). The coffee is good.

The reason the Sow's Ear looses stars is: because the layout of the building is a little wonky -- I felt like I was in people's way the entire time I was browsing the yarn, which was really annoying; and because the yarn selection itself wasn't that inspiring, to be honest. Not that many beautiful fibers -- lots of solid colors, striping yarn, and so forth. They didn't have Madelinetosh, and their Malabrigo selection was pitiful. We actually went back a second day in a row just to double-check that I wasn't missing some magical yarn, a diamond in the rough. I mean, there was one kind of yarn that I really, really liked, but not enough to purchase it. I ended up going to The Knitting Tree and The Cat and Crow and spending almost $200 on yarn at those stores. 

This isn't to say that I won't go back, but I just wasn't impressed this time."}
{"text":"What could be better than a combination yarn store and coffee shop? It seems the Sow's Ear keeps getting bigger and better every time I stop in. The yarn selection is excellent and the staff is absolutely wonderful. Some yarn shops feel intimidating when you walk in the door... even a bit pretentious. But the Sow's Ear is like a second home, where no one will judge you for asking a beginner's question or knitting with (gasp) Red Heart. 

The rewards program is really nice - you get a plastic card that is scanned every time you buy. Everything is electronic (no paper punch card to lose)."}
{"text":"Charmjng little cafe. Ordered a cortado, which isn't on the menu. And i love when baristas already know what it is. This one was done well. Quality of the espresso was toasty and slightly fruity. 

Free wifi

Great place to work when your office is getting too dull, (and super close to Epic!)"}
{"text":"Amazing Quiche. It was the best I've ever had. You can tell it's homemade, fresh, and uses quality ingredients. This will be a new favorite for me."}
{"text":"The kind of place I love! Great coffee options (Kickapoo, Intelligentsia) and inspired food menu. Coffee house meets knitters united but you can chill out in this rustic house turned coffee meet up and enjoy locally sourced menu. We enjoyed the coffee and lattes and an amazing hot panini style caprese sandwich."}
{"text":"Cute little shop that combines great coffee with knitting.  They also have an assortment of treats and bakery items.  

Their coffee is strong and reliable.  And the baristas take good care of their customers with friendly, personal service.  It doesn't take them long to remember you, and your favorite drink.

The only downside is the potential wait during the morning rush, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Ask for Sylvie. Her yarn taste- both color and textile- is spot on. I just regret that Ben left; he was the king of coffee."}
{"text":"I have been to a large number of coffee shops across the entire US and find this one to be a gem amount them. This shop exhibits a unique atmosphere with the knitting wool shop integrated into the seeming residential building. If i was in the area with reading or work todo this would be an ideal setting. The service was great taking enough time to provide quality to your order. I was not incredibly impressed with the flavor. But would return for more."}
{"text":"Lovely coffee house with a small menu. Food options are stronger than many coffee houses which only offer muffins and donuts. The quiche is delicious and satisfying; salads are also good. Lots of drink options other than coffee, are available. You can sit outside on the small front porch or inside. The seating area is small with approximately 14 to 16 seats inside. Often, since there is also a knitting shop inside, you will find knitters and knitting clubs drinking coffee while they work. It's a very interesting and stimulating place to enjoy a beverage.  There is ample parking on both side streets."}
{"text":"Great yarn selection and really good coffeehouse food, too."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee drinks at a cute place. The Caramel-O is divine. Outdoor seating, kid play space - awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I ordered a whole milk chai latte and was not disappointed. My friend ordered the carmel-ohhhh and it smelled amazing. I would definitely become a regular if I lived in this area!

Also, they have a great selection of yarn and apparently teach classes?!"}
{"text":"I love The Sow's Ear! I'm there just about every weekend. Their quiches, pies, and sandwiches are all fantastic. I haven't had anything I didn't love! They get just about all of their stuff from local sources, so the ingredients are always really fresh. 

The yarn you can buy there is super high quality as well. Yes, it costs a bit more but your finished product is that much better because of it. They vary their classes quite a bit to fit all levels as well, so whether you're a seasoned and decorated knitter or just starting out, they've got something for you. :)"}
{"text":"I don't get it. 

For knitters, this must be a cute and comfy place to work on some projects while sipping a nice, warm drink. I, however, wanted to grab lunch during my break and based my decision to come here solely on the 5 star reviews likely given to the store, and not for the food.

My sandwich (Savory Sow) took nearly 40 minutes to get to me, and when it arrived, I was very disappointed in the size and the flavor was just meh. 

I opted for the greens, which were unbelievably bitter and not helped by the disgustingly sour and equally bitter dressing. Don't order greens ;)

I got a peanut butter cookie, which was delicious and I might stop in again just to get one."}
{"text":"Sow's Ear is a great place to come and knit in a relaxing, friendly environment.  Their hours are extensive - 6:30 am to 8:30 pm weekdays unless it is Late Night which is the first and third Friday of the month when closing time is 11:00 pm.  Weekend hours are 7:00 am to 5:00 pm.  The food and beverages are quite tasty and available until closing time.  I am glad this wonderful oasis was recommended when I wanted to learn to knit."}
{"text":"I visited the Sow's Ear in Verona while in Madison  on business.  I found the offering to be current, varied, and luscious.  The staff was helpful and knowledgeable.  The shop also serves coffee (which is quite good) and encourages customers to stay and knit while they enjoy their coffee!  I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.  I wish I lived closer because I would be there ALL the time!"}
{"text":"Sow's Ear is a fun place to come for knitting supplies.  Their hours are a bit inconvenient for me, since they close at like 6pm for a coffee shop.  It's because they regularly run knitting classes in the evenings.  Occasionally they have their late night knitting on Fridays where they're open until 11pm, and usually that's when I manage to make it out to Verona from Madison.  

The place is quite charming.  There are plenty of little niches throughout the place to hide away and knit for a while.  The walls and shelves of yarn and other knitting supplies are inspirational in their colors and fiber.  There are also patterns for sale.  The staff is knowledgeable about the many different kinds of yarn as well.  This is a great place for a knitter in Madison to check out."}
{"text":"Great menu options for a cafe. The chicken salad sandwich was good besides the bread being over toasted. Seemed a little over priced for what we got, but I'd prefer quality over quantity. Would still go back because it's better than the sports bar options in town."}
{"text":"The best coffee shop in Verona!  Great service and staff!  I'm not a knitter, but love the environment if eating in.  New parking lot in back offers plenty of spaces to choose from within short walking distance."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison, my future in-laws took me to Sow's Ear. I'm a new knitter, taught myself about 6 months ago and I still get a little intimidated by stuffy knitting stores and more experienced knitters who scowl at my choice of knitting fabrics (hey! acrylic is great yarn to learn with!).

 I asked if there were onions in the quiches and they were honest enough to tell me how onion heavy their food was. See, I don't like onions and I've had bad experiences with encountering onions in my food from all types of eateries. I appreciated their honesty. 

I sat down with my bun and coffee and realized that I forgot my cabling needle, again. This was the second time I forgot my cabling needle while on a trip. I was determined to not buy another one. So I drank my coffee and ate my bun, while I seethed, my mood matching the dark and stormy weather.  

My mood changed dramatically after my coffee, when I went to explore their yarns and needles. I did not buy a cabling needle but I did buy 3 40'' circular needles for projects I had been waiting to do. I may have forgotten my cabling needle but I did remember to bring my thin binder full of patterns I wanted to try, so I knew which needles to get and which yarn to look at. The people working there were so very helpful, they looked at my patterns, gave me advice and even taught me how to wind my yarn. It was so fun. The yarn was a little pricey, but yarn is always going to be pricey if you want the good stuff. The needles were insanely cheap, I've seen them marked up double were I live in Santa Barbara and the staff here are not nearly as helpful. 

I'll definitely come back to Sow's Ear the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"It's a cute little store that combines coffee shop/cafe with knitting supplies. Harvest Latte was exactly what I was hoping for on a beautiful Sunday that made me excited for fall. 

The breakfast menu left a little to be desired. Basically an assortment of quiches, yogurt, or oatmeal were the choices. We had the Tomato Basil and Cauliflower bacon quiche. Both were very well made and actually just filling enough for a good breakfast. Still wish they had a breakfast sandwich or two on the menu, for variety. 

All in all a good little place off the main drag in Verona."}
{"text":"The people are really nice and the food is great. My niece likes coming with me so she can play with the kids toys. It has great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Always love a coffee shop in an old house. If you knit you really won't want to miss this, as their shop is also a knitting store. I don't knit, but looked like quite a selection. We only did coffee drinks and smoothies, but everyone was pleased with the order. Service was quick. Coffee is strong."}
{"text":"If you're visiting from out of town, make sure you stop by here.  They have a varied selection of yarns that are at least dyed in the area.  I bought a lovely locally dyed yarn to make my daughter a cardi, and another locally dyed yarn to make myself a cowl. 

The staff were knowledgeable and friendly.  The coffee was good.  They have a good variety of non-coffee beverages, which made my husband very happy."}
{"text":"It's more like 3.5 stars.  The coffee is good, but as often as not they are out of it when you go to fill your cup.  I mean??? It's a coffee house, your supposed to have coffee!  Usually I can afford to wait while they brew some more, but if you are grabbing a cup to take along, well... take your chances.  Keep the coffee pot full and hot and I will give you an another star."}
{"text":"This shop combines coffee, breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy). During a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens. There were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters. Service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love the Sow's Ear! It's my home away from home. The atmosphere there is so inviting & comfortable. 
Great yarn selection, classes are awesome, staff is friendly & helpful, & the coffee is always top notch. I highly recommend their frozen hot chocolate while knitting or crocheting. 
Their rewards program is not limited to yarn purchases, so even if you just go for the coffee, you can benefit."}
{"text":"Nice, friendly staff. Love their sandwiches, the Prosciutto caprese melt was fantastic. Cozy welcoming atmosphere, overall great place for brunch."}
{"text":"I adore this place!  It's colorful, warm and welcoming.  The chicken salad sandwich is excellent, too.  I'm very fond of the rose syrup they have for Italian sodas, and blended with strawberry is a tiny little icy heaven.  They have a great point system, too- rather than punch cards.  The system applies to all purchases- which is helpful, since I buy a good amount of roving.  A nice feature is that you often start a conversation with the barista, it ends up traveling all across the room, you meet all sorts of people, and have interesting and often enlightening conversations.

Their Wifi rarely works properly, though.  I'm saddened by the number of times I've taken the laptop there to do homework, then have to leave because the internet's down."}
{"text":"Let's get lost in a world of yarn together as well as pick up some cute stoneware souvenirs for home. 

Yarn:
I been meaning to explore the Sow's Ear on my last trip to Verona and am quite happy to have gotten the chance to pick up some luxurious and decently priced Vintage DK yarns. 

Goodies:
They have mugs and other items for sale. Purchased two (green glazed and blue glazed) mugs for future sipping and knitting. 

Food:
Yummy warm apple cider. Soups are ok - should have gotten the quiche which was recommended. 

They have this cool machine in the back which rolls your yarn into a ball for you. They even show you and let you do it yourself if you ask nicely :)

Great local shop and would gladly buy more goods here again soon."}
{"text":"Needles and caffeine together under one roof. Why yes, please.

I thought parking was going to be a pain because the few times that I've driven by, it looked like there was only street parking available, but it was actually a breeze. There is a tiny parking lot in the back, and since the area around the cafe is mostly residential, there is a lot of street side parking to be found. (: Awesome.

I ordered a 12 oz mocha and a sweet potato, shiitake, and provolone quiche. The mocha is a little too foamy for my taste, but it's strong and the perfect wake-me-up. The quiche was light but filling, which I really appreciated. I'm not a huge breakfast foods fanatic, and I hate really heavy breakfasts that weigh me down for the rest of the day, so I thought the quiche was a perfect compromise. Serving the quiche with a side of greens is a nice touch too, though I'm not a big fan of the salad dressing.

Free wifi is a plus, as is the availability of outlets near every table.

I felt quite a bit out of place with the rest of the clientele, but I can see why many people enjoy spending a Sunday afternoon here. Don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon, but I'm glad I gave Sow's Ear a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great customer service, both baristas that I talked to were fantastic. You can tell they care about their product. The milk is from a local area farm. They hand make their bakery items. You seriously cannot do better in Verona. Stop going to Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian friendly food. Excellent coffee. Wonderful yarn selection. If I lived closer, I would probably be here multiple times a week."}
{"text":"What a nice spot for a coffee meet up with a friend!  There is 2 hour street parking on the side of the building or a public parking lot behind the building.  The coffee shop is in the front of the building and a knitter's paradise shop is in the space in the back.  There are different types of sitting spots for your choice.  Tables inside, comfy chairs and couches.  Outdoor seating.

My friend and I were having a spot of lunch while we were there.  We ordered the Caprese sandwich (fresh mozzarella, tomato, balsamic vinegar, and a basil pesto on French  baguette) and the Savory Sow (Brie, roasted red peppers, and balsamic vinaigrette toasted on a French baguette).  Both cheese sandwiches were so good.  Fresh and tasty!  The sandwiches come with choice of chips or fresh greens dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette with a subtle taste of lemon.

I also had a mocha to drink.  Really it was a very well balance cup of yummy coffee and chocolate flavor.   This location is worth the short drive out of Madison for a chat with a friend who lives further out towards UFO country."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop in downtown. We walked there each day of our 3-day visit to Verona. The coffee drinks we tried (americano, cappuccino, mocha) were all good. And the oatmeal made a great hearty breakfast. The outdoor seating was lovely place to sit and watch the cyclists and runners go by. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Chicken salad sandwich and strawberry -banana smoothie was delicious!  Quick, friendly service and a great, laid back atmosphere with knitting supplies and yarn in every color of the rainbow. 
Only complaint: the soup was not hot enough. 
Worth coming for a coffee, lunch or knit!"}
{"text":"A very cute little coffee shop with a lovely atmosphere that makes me want to spend the whole afternoon here"}
{"text":"The Sow's Ear is a cute little cafe/knitting shop located inside a house-themed that gives it a nice home feeling. 

The food was reasonably priced and my boyfriend tipped $5 in the tip jar at the counter in support of good local business. 

We ordered a grilled cheese meal with chips, a bowl of the daily soup of tomato and roasted bell peppers, and a fruit and nut salad.  However, the food we ordered was slightly underwhelming. The grilled cheese was too crusty, over cooked and tough to eat. Although, dipped inside the soup, it tasted a little better since the soup softened the bread and made it more edible. The fruit and nut salad was a bit simple and wasn't satisfying. 

We also ordered two drinks: iced latte and iced chai latte. Both was a little heavy on the milk but we were able to finish it since an iced drink is always nice on a hot sunny day! 

Overall, it was a nice brunch meal and the atmosphere is catered towards knitters who are there to enjoy a simple meal or cafe drink while knitting. There's also the knitting supplies store as well as knitting classes offered throughout the year."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cafes in the Madison area to come and spend a leisurely day. The store offers up the usual menu of coffee drinks, plus salads, bakery, a few sandwiches, and an extensive selection of quiches from LMNO'Pies--not to mention a store full of kitting supplies. Come any time of day and you will be sure to find someone knitting while sipping their coffee, or maybe a large group of women babbling about their latest kitting projects. (If you're a knitter be sure to check out the occasional class offerings and group meetings.) All in all The Sow's Ear offers a very down-home, comfy feel.

The coffee drinks are well-prepared and the drip coffee is from Ancora (Madison-based roaster). The mocha smoothie is well worth three dollars if you're looking for a sweet treat. And the quiches are always excellent. Be prepared to wait more than a few minutes if you order food, especially if you come at a busy time. But always worth the wait, and the prices are hard to beat. The staff is always friendly and helpful.

Free wireless is available and there is plenty of sitting space to relax with a book, knit, sip or eavesdrop. Or all of the above!"}
{"text":"I don't know if anything baked is vegan but they have a ton of packaged options for vegans! They also serve both soy and almond milk :) which is a huge plus.  Their espresso drinks can be iffy, with a lot of cafes baristas tend to burn nut milk because it burns at a different degree than cow milk, but still!!! Most times I'm satisfied and I always love the ambiance."}
