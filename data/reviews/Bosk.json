{"text":"Our server, Jan Michael was amazing -super attentive, friendly, efficient. He recommended some appetizers from the menu and we ended up ordering 5 of them (since there were 5 of us) -the cream of corn soup (including a vegan version) which has to be one of the best soups I have ever tried, the lobster gnocchi appetizer, the fresh tomato salad and the scallops. For mains, we ordered the agnolotti pasta, the lamb, chicken breast, and the sablefish (my husband has never eaten sablefish and said it was one of the best fish dishes he has ever ordered).  We loved the restaurant setting and interior design.  And the desserts were amazing too. With the bill came chocolates, white chocolate puffs and rosewater jellies. This restaurant is fantastic for a special dinner out. I would highly recommend this restaurant -it was one of the best meals we had in Toronto."}

Price: $$$ for brunch

Inside the restaurant, I was taken aback at how pretty it was! All the interior decor was definitely my style and it was so lovely. When we arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty with only a few tables occupied, but at the end of our meal, Bosk was full of customers.

We were presented with our brunch menu pretty quickly after we were seated. I had previously known about their 3 course brunch menu - $39 per person for 2 courses with $7 extra for the dessert course. At $46 for 3 courses, the whole meal didn't seem too bad; in fact, it seemed quite affordable for a 3 course meal at a fine dining restaurant in a 5 star luxury hotel.

My glass is empty in the picture, but we asked for sparkling water. Bosk has their own in-house sparkling water available free of charge. Aside from water, we were each offered a glass of freshly squeezed juice. I believe orange, pomegranate and apple? juices were available to choose from, and I chose to drink pomegranate juice. Our orders were quickly taken by our waiter and shortly after, our first course arrived. It didn't take long for them to prepare it I guess, as there weren't that many customers yet.

My husband went for the salad option on the menu while I chose to enjoy a charcuterie board. Both were equally good, but I think my dish was more delicious. I love cheese and charcuterie, so having this for brunch was very enjoyable for me! I highly recommend you to try the charcuterie board if it's still available on the brunch menu. I didn't get to finish the charcuterie board as I had to leave room for my second meal even though hubby helped me with my dish. 

My husband decided to try the chicken breast dish for his main meal that day - he was on a health kick!  Anyway, I'm not a fan of chicken breast; the usual dry texture really isn't my favourite and I have difficulty enjoying usually any dish that is made with chicken breast. However, this chicken dish was different; I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, and the chicken breast wasn't as dry as I thought it would be. Hubby enjoyed his dish very much and told me that he would definitely reorder it again.

I decided to go a little more classic with my main meal - a smoked salmon benedict! In all honesty, I couldn't even finish one of the benedicts as I was so full from the cheese and charcuterie board from earlier, but the eggs benedict was really, really good! I suppose you can't really go wrong with an eggs benedict, but the hollandaise sauce was really well made. Two thumbs up from me.

After our main course, we were asked if we preferred any coffee or tea. My husband chose coffee (of course) while I chose to enjoy peppermint tea. Though my husband didn't order any dessert, he did ask for some macarons to enjoy with coffee. The macarons were for lobby lounge guests but hubby asked if we could enjoy them inside the restaurant, and they gladly let us.

The dessert that I ordered was high quality- it was perfect for the two of us to share as well. It was sweet enough for both of us, and definitely a great dessert to enjoy with coffee or tea to balance out the sweetness. The size portion was worth the extra $7 as well.

Fine dining for brunch definitely isn't an everyday thing, but it's totally worth splurging on once in awhile. Restaurant Bosk is the perfect place to come to enjoy a champagne brunch with your girlfriends and we highly recommend it! The quality is definitely high not only in terms of food but service as well as it should be. I would definitely go back if I was back in Toronto right now."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for lunch, came across Bosk at Shangri-La, one of the only places open on new year's day. 
Had not heard much about this place, but given limited options, we decided to give  this asian fusion restaurant a try.

The ambience and decor were fabulous. Our server was polite and on top of things. I ordered seared scallops with shitake mushrooms/avocado in a light dill creme base. The scallops were nicely cooked and sauce was the perfect complement.

For main course, I went with sablefish/soba noodles. Having never tried sablefish before, i was quite pleased with the delicate, tender white fish that essentially melted in my mouth. There were pieces of shitake mushroom and snow peas in the bowl of light broth. A nice satisfying dish for a cold new years day!"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was amazing.
I was there only for drinks and their amazing deserts.
1) Staff is very welcoming and attentive.
2) The decor and the atmosphere is to die for. This place is perfect for a date.
3) The presentation of the desert was beautiful and there were abolutely delicious. The cheesecake was the best I have ever tasted.

Strongly recommend this place. Will try to dine there next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed my first experience at Bosk. Although I was hoping to order from the regular menu, they were only offering the Summerlicious prix fixe menu at the time. Given that I am not the biggest Summerlicious fan (dishes often seem below-standard and I prefer to forgo dessert in favour of a bigger/better main,) I was pleasantly surprised. Apps were basic but good. I enjoyed my steak entree that came with a somewhat-buttery sauce (my partner wasn't a fan of the sauce). He really enjoyed the halibut and we both loved the desserts - chocolate mousse and citrus cake. 

The service really stood out. Very friendly staff who were witty and helpful. I definitely want to try this place when the regular menu is in play."}
{"text":"First of all, awesome enviornment, even one of the best restaurant I have ever set foot in. Secondly, staff is kind and helpful, though this is kind of within my expectations. I am not surprise but definetely satisfied.

Now, the main reasons why I gave it 5 stars instead of 4, is the food. It tastes EXCELLENT, appetizers was good enouch to steal some of the limplight for the main course, yet main course still remains one of the best food i have eaten. Dessert was good but too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious today. Menu and food is good for $28. However, they walk around asking if you want water, you say yes, they pour you a glass and then they charge you $2.5 for it....I ordered an espresso as well, most espressos are a buck or 2...NO, THIS ONE WAS $7, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I SAW THAT ON MY BILL! the espresso wasn't even that good, I've had much better espressos at small mom and pop Italian cafe for $1.5! My lunch ended up being about $50 after tip and tax, when the summerlicious menu was only $28....very upsetting."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place given its status as the Shangri La restaurant. Sadly I was disappointed with the food and service. I went there with a party of six for a Sunday Summerlicious lunch. The hotel lobby and restaurant were nicely designed, I loved their ambience and touches of Asian influence. We tried a variety of dishes from their summerlicious menu. None of us liked the chilled pea soup or beet salad appetizers. There was some effort put into making the dishes look nice but we were not that impressed. Servings were small in general. For mains, we had the pasta, fish and chicken. I only tried the Atlantic Salmon, which was good, but not wow. For dessert, I had the Niagara peaches which was ok. I found the flavours did not really go well together (they had a coffee/tea flavour pudding in it). Overall we were a bit disappointed with the experience, maybe because we had high expectations for a five star hotel restaurant. OK for $25 prix fixe but I probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Dined here July 17th for summerlicious and I'm glad i did. I managed to snag a last minute reservation the day before. The restaurant is located in Shangri la. There is a nice lobby/bar area. Service was excellent and had a nice ambience. I would definately return to try the regular menu.

For apps we had the tomatoe soup which was a bit too tarte for my liking, and the tuna app which was the clear winner of the two. It had nice textures with the crunchy rice noodle and lime dressing.

For mains we had roasted flat iron steak which was cooked to a perfect medium and the taste was perfect. The pork belly main was also a solid choice. 

For the dessert we had the mango pudding with tapioca, lime sorbet with a seseme cookie. It tasted as good as it looked. The chocolate pudding though more rustic looking and was the clear winner....there was cookie crumble and chocolate mixed together and it was a nice rich dessert."}
{"text":"Great service but if your looking for a \"happening\" place with a energetic ambience this is not the place.

Portions are smaller for what you pay for sure."}
{"text":"Experience was amazing, very high end restaurant but quality of there food does justice to prices. Definitely will visit again"}
{"text":"Bosk is a great restaurant in terms of atmosphere, presentation, and food. It is definitely more pricey but I think it is worth it. I heard that the chef has changed but I am not sure and have to look into this. Every time I have been there I have had a fantastic time and been well taken care of in terms of food. 

I have had many dishes there from, seafood to beef to foie gras. Since the menu always changes I will mention the dishes I always remember: the lamb shoulder with artichoke pakoras, the wagyu tri tip with black onion puree, the foie gras, and the poached lemon as a dessert! 

I usually go with a friend and between the two of us we end up trying 4 to 6 dishes. I find that usually 3 to 4 are fantastic while 1 to 2 are good or ok. I remember I had this skate fish with chicken skin and without the chicken skin it worked but with it, it did not. However, that is just my taste buds...I like chicken skin fried in a skillet..deep fried I don't like the after taste.

I think any restaurant that is consistently getting the majority of dishes at a great level with 1 to 2 being good or ok is a top level restaurant. This is again one of the best places in my book in Toronto. Even for the dishes that I felt were ok, they were prepared correctly. The meats were cooked correctly, the sauces were done right, etc. It was merely the dish not working for me. Which means the effort and skill were present...my tongue just wasn't accepting it. 

I tend to fly around for restaurants...when I travel I always end up at Michelin 2 or 3 star places...unfortunately Toronto does not have this rating. However, if it did. Acadia and Bosk would easily get a super strong 1 Michelin star and depending on the menu, would definitely get 2 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice treat both food and ambience wise. Went here with some colleagues for lunch. While the wine menu was lacking in affordable options, the lentil soup and fries were very tasty. And the cappuccino was fantastic. All in all, would recommend."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner here with my family recently. The service was impeccable, the ambiance was classy, and the food was delightful but not captivating. Overall, an exquisite experience that is worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to come here today but most of the other restaurants in Shangri-La Hotel were closed for that dead time in between lunch and dinner so my business group and I went to Bosk for a late lunch. Stepping in was a pleasant surprise, as the decor was understated but impeccable, with a huge, gleaming espresso machine at the bar and lovely wood-blocked walls. We were seated by the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking their empty patio and bustling University Ave. Then, we were poured sparkling water out of the most magnificent and elegant glass carafe I had ever seen while we looked over our menus. I ordered the duck confit and everyone else ordered halibut. Sadly, we were too lost in our lively discussion for me to try the halibut off my friend's plate but the duck was lovely and crispy, accompanied by peaches, parsnips, and mustard seeds. Although I didn't care for the parsnips, overall the food was fresh and well presented. We also ordered prosecco and orange juice (separately) off menu and I was pleased that the OJ was freshly squeezed.

TL;DR

Food: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5"}
{"text":"The deserts are out of this world!
Yummy chocolate fondant.  Go try it."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious.  The food and service were fantastic!  One of my biggest pet peeves in upper-scale restaurants is the lunchbag let down when you get to desert.  This was not the case, the deserts were just as good as the meals if not better!  The chocolate mousse is sex in a cup....OH MY GAWD!"}
{"text":"Great high end meal from top to bottom. All dishes and apps ordered by our party of 6 were excellent. Highlights included the prom trio, pickerel, lobster angolotti, and the gnocchi. Deserts were also great and creative. Service was also wonderful. Was thoroughly impressed with Bosk and would not hesitate to recommend it to the foodie crowd."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch and I have to say, they do live up to all the good reviews.

The restaurant itself is so fresh, elegant and beautiful. Our server was very gorgeous too ;) 

The place wasn't one of those loud places which was really comfortable while talking. 

Had the Ontario gathered leaves salad and the BC steelhead salmon which were both delicious. The salmon was extra good! I just loved it. Wine would've been so great with it (but was work so....). They seemed to have a great Wine collection as well. 

The rosemary bread served st the beginning was ohhh sooo good !

The water serving instrument was very interesting and added uniqueness to the place. Love how it's all glass and it must look even better at night. 

Definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! 

The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and the ambience was lovely. 

Went for brunch and so glad I did. Our large table of 8 was treated extremely well and we all loved our food. Very much the place Toronto was missing for special occasions. 

Would love to come back and try the spa!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 10 minutes late for our 2pm reservation, our other guest was parking the car, we were worried that we would be turned away but we were promptly seated. Not 10 minutes later the manager or some other manager level person came over and belittled us, she said \"That we needed to hurry up and order because the kitchen closed 10 minutes ago\". My mother was parking the car and she went so far as demand that I call her and read the menu so we could order\" I did not appreciate this, if my reservation was for 2pm how can the kitchen close10 minutes later. It often takes longer than 10 minutes to make such a decision, and she stood at our table for a while going on and on about how we needed to hurry up in a very rude tone. If our late arrival was a problem then they could have turned us away. I understand its Winterlicious but I do go to other upscale restaurants regularly so I know that was very inappropriate, in fact even though we were the last ones seated we were not the last ones to leave I understand that they have to close for dinner but it was just very rude. The only thing that saved the lunch was the lovely waiter. Also the food was lovely but the way I was treated overshadowed the meal."}
{"text":"Was a great meal with great presentation but the restaurant lacked ambience for the cost. You could hear the lobby band blasting and mixing with the restaurant music and it felt like we were eating at the bus stations"}
{"text":"Bosk is located in the Shangri-La hotel which is also home to the Momofuku group of restaurants.  Given that this is a restaurant located in a high end luxury hotel, it is a given that the restaurant was well appointed with a slight Asian flare or motif to its overall design. When seated within the restaurant, there is a bit of noise which filters in from the hotel lobby and bar (there was live music playing on the night I attended), but it's not so loud as to be a distraction, and I was easily able to hold a conversation with my wife over dinner. 

The staff at the restaurant are quite knowledgeable regarding the menu and were easily able to answer any questions we had about the menu items. Their knowledge also extended to the wine list which was great. As expected of a higher end restaurant, the service was courteous and professional. 

We started with the Butter Poached Lobster and the Seared Rougie Foie Gras. Both dishes were quite good. There was a good helping of lobster and it was served with beet and squid ink crisp which made for an interesting combination that worked reasonably well. The flavour of the lobster was not lost however and was simply highlighted by the other flavours. Similarly, the foie gras was quite good and as you would expect, the flavour was quite rich and delicate.  What more can I say about foie gras?  When it's done right and done simply, it's usually pretty delicious. 

For our main dishes, we had the Nova Scotia Scallops and the Atlantic Halibut.  Once again, both dishes were quite good. In my opinion, like the starters, the main dishes were reasonably innovative in their composition but the flavour combinations didn't work quite as well.  The presentation was adequate and the portion sizes of the dishes was also quite reasonable. The scallops were cooked just right and not over-cooked. Initially, I wasn't sure the addition of gochujang (korean hot red chili paste) to the scallops would work but it turned out okay. The Halibut was also well cooked such that it was tender and reasonable flaky.  The pommes purée didn't distract from the fish but I'm not sure how much it enhanced the dish either. 

The starters were $26 and the mains were $42 (scallops were a starter dish that we had as a main dish for $33). There was also the option of having a 3 course dinner for $75 or 4 courses for $90.  There is also a pre-theatre menu that gives you the option of 2 courses for $39 or 3 courses for $49. All in all, the prices are in line with what you expect from a restaurant such as this located in a high-end luxury hotel. Once again, the matter of value is rather subjective and the prices at Bosk are in-line with what you would expect at comparable restaurants, however, personally, I felt it was slightly pricey for what you get. 

Ultimately, if you are in the neighborhood (eg. to see a show or something similar) and you're dressed up and looking for a nice place to take a date for dinner, Bosk would be a good place to go. It offers a nice ambiance in a high-end hotel, with good food, located close to the theatre district. Just know, that the wallet/purse will take a bit of a hit."}
{"text":"Excellent! My girl friends and I recently had a Winterlicious lunch at Bosk and we enjoyed it very much. The interior of the restaurant itself is beautiful, somewhat modern with an Asian feel to it (seeing that it's located inside the Shangri-La Hotel T.O.). All the servers and waitresses inside the restaurant was dressed up nicely in their uniform. Catered to us whenever we needed and was very well mannered. The lunch Winterlicious menu that they had there was good, I wouldn't say amazing because some of the dishes were a bit too salty for me. I ordered the Foie Gras for app, Pasta for main, and Poached Apple for dessert. I think I will definitely come back again to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. 
The food is delicious and the service is amazing. If you can, request for Trevor to be your server. 
If you have a special occasion or simply want to have a luxurious meal, here is the place. 
Also, very romantic."}
{"text":"Okay - this place sucks. Not worth the $!

- Food is art on a plate (which is as expected)... but it's not delicious
- I got the halibut and they said they dont have it so they offered me saber fish (wtf?). The halibut came with cheese / mozerella balls which was disgusting. Fish was slightly undercooked and didn't have a good enough sear on it. There was no skin on the fish which i love... unfortunatley it was all meat (and that explains the lack of sear.
- I asked for still water, they gave me sparkling (waiter couldn't hear me)
- Food did not fill us up (we ordered two sides and we still werent full)
- break / butter pre-meal was complimentary and delicious
- food took long to come out (lunch service should be faster than dinner). It took 35 mins for food to come out and appetizer came our at the same time as our meal (wtf is the point of that!?)
- fries were delicious
- glad this was a company paid lunch...i'd never spend my own $ here. 
- nice ambiance though.. clean and chic."}
{"text":"Came here for the Summerlicious lunch special and the food and service were outstanding."}
{"text":"I went there for summerlicious, quality was very good, service was awesome too. My friend was not happy about her main course and they brought her a new one! Deserve a five star!"}
{"text":"Dinner for two on a Saturday night for Summerlicious. We ordered the tomato salad and corn soup for appetizers, strip loin and halibut for the main course, and the coconut cake and chocolate dish for dessert. 

The appetizers were great. We have never had corn soup before and it was absolutely delicious. The poached egg added a unique flavour and texture to the dish. Tomato salad was one of the best I've ever had. 

The entree dishes were both fantastic. Both the halibut and strip loin was cooked to perfection. No complaints here. 

The dessert was, as the previous two courses, delicious. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant is great. The decor is very elegant and the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable. 

I would definitely recommend Bosk to anyone!"}
{"text":"I dined at Bosk for the first time tonight and will definitely not be returning.

Although the food was good enough, it's certainly pricey. What ruined the experience for me though was being charged $2.50 for a glass 'still' water. Even though the charge was removed from my bill when I complained, it ruined the experience. Two stars are warranted nevertheless for the service, ambiance and complimentary newspaper."}
{"text":"#Summerlicious 2017
Came for lunch on the last day of Summerlicious, and I was lucky enough to snatch a spot for lunch just one day before. And boy, this place did NOT disappoint (procrastination can be rewarding after all:D)
Bread (4.8/5.0) - The bread was soft, moist, and had interesting flavor to it. It was served with mixed herb butter, and the two together? Just AMAZING. I HAD to get extra bread despite an entire meal waiting ahead of me:D
Appetizer - cream broccoli soup (2.5/5.0) Despite raving reviews from fellow yelpers, it was just too creamy for me. The flavor wasn't exactly enjoyable either... I mean come on, cream AND broccoli? Neither of those fit my definition of good soup:/ But then again, I've always preferred tomato-based soups, so I might not be the best judge of character on this one:p
Main - crunchy chicken breast (5.0/5.0) Simply Amazing!!! The chicken was tender, moist, had great flavor; the crust was crunchy, also great flavor; mushrooms on the side was so mushroom-y and there was this puree and spring peas... And everything came together perfectly!! I've never ordered chicken breast at a restaurant before(too healthy for me), but getting this one? Definitely the right choice:D
Dessert - vanilla mousse (4.2/5.0) Presentation was absolutely stunning:) Texture of the mouse was light, fluffy, not overly creamy or sweet, and I loved the additional touch of yummy pearls in there!!! However, as I got close to the bottom, I was surprised to find there were actually cake. And that cake was TOUGH, I had trouble breaking it with a spoon. What then oozed out from the bottom of that cake was even worse -- strawberry jam that tasted exactly like Smuker's(i.e. artificial & overly sweet), which kinda ruined the rest of my dessert a bit... Seriously, it would better if they'd just skip the jam all together:/
The decor here was nice, elegant and classy; the service was polite and professional. You can tell this was not the kind of place that aimed to make you feel at home, but exactly the kinda place that never messes up your anniversary/special occations.
Looking forward to Winterlicious (or next time my folks are in town;)"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that I come back to again and again. My wife and I frequent this restaurant for our anniversary, for birthdays and any time we want to have a special experience.

The service is impeccable. I noted to my wife the first time we ate here that the waitress must have been changing clothes every time she emerged from the kitchen. Everything about this place is spotless, from the tables and chairs to the staff. Everything is just so. The only time I can think of where I experienced service and style this exacting was at a three Michelin star restaurant in Paris. Luckily Bosk will not cost you nearly so much.

As for the food, I struggle to describe the genre. Continental? It is typical in terms of the selection of what you would expect to see in a hotel restaurant. But whatever you order, it is excellent, period full stop. Each mouthful is an affirmation of good taste. You will savor every bite."}
{"text":"Great food including the complimentary bread and butter!!! Wine pairing for food could be a bit stronger. Beer menu very lacklustre. Decor incredibly lovely and romantic. Great background music. Perfect place for a date night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to participate for the Winterlicious event. We made reservation for dinner and enjoyed their dinner menu. We already had researched the place and expected it was going to be very pricy. I had also ordered one drink on top of the Winterlicious menu. With gratuity and tax in total I treated us out with a total of about $150. 

The people are very nice and accommodating. It was very busy at the time we went which may explain why the food service was a bit slow (especially for our main dish). However, we were both satisfied with the food. As a starter we both had the Albacore Tuna (3.5/5). I enjoyed the Poached Halibut (5/5) while my boyfriend had the Pork Loin (4.5) as our main dish. For dessert, I ordered the Gingerbread (4/5) and my boyfriend had the plate cheese (3/5). 

Overall, I think it was a very good experience. The place in general is nice, clean and comfortable. We probably would not come back any time soon because it was a very pricey dinner."}
{"text":"\"It's Not The Mistake That Matters, It's How You Deal With It\"

Brutal experience over lunch at Bosk. My friend and I both ordered burgers. $22 burgers. If I can get a solid burger for $15, a $22 burger better be damn good. My friend asked for his medium rare, and I asked for medium. Both of ours arrived well done. We were in a rush, so we both ate half as we waited for the wait staff to come by; when they did, we shared our disappointment, and they apologized and walked away. When the bill arrived, we were charged the full amount. Are you kidding me? At $22 a burger, cook it properly. And if you can't, find a way to do right by your customers. That's the last time I ever eat at Bosk and would encourage you to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was my first experience to Bosk. I was looking forward to it as it's a part of Shangari-la Hotel. The lunch itself was not bad. My main, duck confit, was a bit on the salty side, but it was acceptable. The dessert, chocolate hazelnut tart, was mediocre. I  wasn't impressed by the tart or my friend's warm toffee pudding. I will give 3 stars for the food.

Next, I'd like to mention about some details in the services. When we were seated, I wanted to get a table with more light. The table assigned to us was tooo dark. Then apparently, they CAN'T give us another table. So, they moved the table from the dark spot to the right, so that we can get a bit light.. After we were seated, the waiter came to us with two bottles of water in his hand. There were no labels on the water botter. Then he asked, which water do you want, flat water or sparkling water. We thought both of them are complimentary. So we got the sparkling water. Later it reflects on the bill that it's $5 charge. Even it's just $5, I don't feel comfortable with it. It feels like a trap. I told my friends about this, we all think it could be clarified when the water was offered. For the $5, I don't think I'll ever go back to Shangri-la Toronto. Four Seasons and Rtiz are 5 mins away."}
{"text":"A little touch of molecular magic on your plate. We had a leisurely dining experience with a lovely waiter attending to our table. It's takes a sensitivity to artistically crafted flavours combinations to appreciate this restaurant, but it's an experience worth having."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious 2016. 

Wasn't what I expected. I made reservation through opentable, and somehow I booked for 1900 (7pm) it ended up saying 0700 (7am). I was confused as well as the host. There was no follow up call, no reminder call or confirmation prior to my reservation. 

Luckily, the host were able to arrange something for us and we were seated shortly. 

I was never expecting much from Summerlicious menu since it always taste different compare to normal menu and quality usually goes down (which it shouldn't be!) 

Menu was nothing special, what surprised me was the portion was so SMALL! Like my girlfriends were discussing where to dine after having dinner here. 

Taste wise, nothing special to wow me at all. Plating was alright, given that the chef need to place such a small amount of food on such a huge plate. 

I would appreciate more if dishes come a bit faster. Since the portion wasn't big and in between it took so long. Made everyone at the table starving. The restaurant was not busy, there were still empty tables. 

Otherwise, nice environment."}
{"text":"A review long overdue but I have to put in a good word about Bosk.

It is the ideal restaurant for a romantic date. The place is beautiful and nestled in the Shangri-La Hotel. We went late at night and there were some couples there as well, but the environment was quiet and nice. 

Our server was very attentive and proper. He served our water with a fancy long spout which looks like it would take months just to master and not break.

Most importantly, the food was amazing. My boyfriend and I decided not to go for the tasting menu but instead order a la carte for what we liked. Every dish was made flawlessly and was delicious; Bosk is a place to go for fine dining. We had to order the lobster gnocchi and the emulsion was so rich. The beef tartare was a good balance of flavours. I wanted to order the sablefish but sadly the steak they had in the kitchen was not up to par to the chef's standards and he would not cook it. I don't think I would've minded but it comes to show that the kitchen care about serving only ingredients of the highest quality. I chose to eat another kind of fish and that was excellent as well. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the desserts as much as I should have because I was so full from the appetizers and entrees!

Portions are small but dishes are made with finesse. All in all the combination of flavours and textures of each dish bring you to a whole other level of eating!"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious during lunch and the food was so good plus the service was good and the atmosphere was nice. My and my friends were able to try most of the menu since we shared our dishes. And I'm telling you if you're going to winterlicious get the forest mushroom pappardelle, it was so good and also a couple of the people who served us said that was their favourite too. The starters we got were pretty good too. The only part that was meh was the dessert, which weren't bad but following that pasta just seemed lacklustre."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I won't lie, I went in with the expectation of disappointment. Ate at four seasons a few days prior (see my review - soon to follow) and vowed to never return to restaurants in over priced hotels. However, Bosk at the Shang changed all of that. We got the lobster gnocchi - to die for! The salmon which I enjoyed but not my favourite but I will say the salmon was cooked to perfection. We got eggs for appetizer (pls see my pic) and I kid you not, my life changed. Portions are the usual small size for an establishment like this but the flavours and quality certainly made up for it. My friends got the scallops, beet salad and enjoyed it. I'm sure they ordered more but all of us were so into our food that we barely paid attention to each other. I was literally staring at my plate with hearts coming out of my eyes. One more item on the menu (I completely forgot what it was but took a pic of it) is to die for with sunflower seeds, cheese and tiny bits of heaven. Finished it off with bread pudding - you will not regret this choice! House made sorbet? Yes please!!!! I needed a minute to come back to earth after my first bite of both. My friend had the Manhattan and would not stop telling us how fantastic it was so I took a sip and took his berries on a toothpick from him. I don't know what those berries are dipped in but I'm certain that if I could get my hands on it, I would be dipping everything in it. The yummy berries were such a pleasant surprise. Last but not least the staff - our main man Jean Michael was very very thorough explaining the dishes but not with any air of snobbery as I've had to suffer at other equal establishments. He inquired if I was a belieber and I knew from then on I would be back! The amazing chef came out to meet us so we could personally thank him. It's been a LONG time since I've been this impressed with my meal! I will return!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious innovative dishes, top-notch service and an elegantly themed dining room all make for an absolutely fantastic dining experience at Bosk. 

I opted for the tasting menu with standard wine pairing. Each dish was expertly crafted, with great flavor profiles and creative presentation. The caviar donut and sablefish stood out in particular; the caviar donut was an interesting take on the traditional caviar with fixings and blinis, while the sablefish was roasted to perfection with a delicious jus. The wine pairings were all great as well, and complemented the food perfectly. 

Service overall is elegant, with a champagne cart being wheeled out at the beginning. Our server was an absolute pleasure, friendly and attentive and explaining all the options. The champagne that accompanied my amuse-bouche was deemed not bubbly enough by our server and she promptly went back to fetch a new bottle - touches like that really exemplify the emphasis on good service here.
Watching waiters armed with huge spouted glass pitchers refill your waters is a thrill in itself as well. 

Aptly for its name, wooden decor is the main theme here, with artful wooden paneling as well as a large display of wine bottles. Tables are spaced nicely and the dining room is quite cozy overall. 

At $95 plus $65 for a tasting menu and wine pairing, Bosk may not be the cheapest restaurant in town but if you're looking for fine dining, then look no further - this restaurant is wonderful in every aspect."}
{"text":"We had diner in one of their private dining rooms. The food and service was outstanding. I always appreciate a restaurant that does a great job with somewhat larger groups as it puts a nice strain on the kitchen and shows what the kitchen is capable of. In our case we were not disappointed. The decor and design are beautiful."}
{"text":"#winterlicious2016#
Kind of expected their service to be perfect 
Starter:beef tartar. Was okay because the beef was in my opinion too salty. But it still tasted fresh.
Main: braised Ontario pork. Was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned.
Dessert: chocolate ganache cake, I guess you can find it anywhere.
They charge 2.5 for still water which is not very reasonable to me.
Overall the winterlicious experience was good"}
{"text":"Service
SUPERB. Our waiter is cute, good-looking, good manners, good to chat with BUT why did you take so long to bring the machine? He did so well throughout the night, it was such a shame that he failed at the end. I subtracted 2% off his tips, it was so sad. It was honestly one of my better winterlicious experiences for the most part. I just want to add that the washrooms are very nice but super out of the way (outside the restaurant and beside the elevators). You can wave your hand at a button and the doors will automatically open (don't be old-fashioned and push the door lols).

Food

Appetizer
Soup was almost spot on. It was surprisingly spicy; gives off a Thai coconut taste that tings your tongue at the end. I would appreciate if it was less spicy but nevertheless a good surprise. The salad was very simple, super colourful and as per my friends it grew on them.

Entree
The entree was super filling. You would think they may cheap out on the portions but I'm giving them a thumbs up for doing a good job. My biggest complaint is that the pork had too much fat, not enough meat. The cabbage was amazing, not at all salty and made me crave for it. My friend's pasta was not dry - super moist. For pasta to be this smooth, soft, and full of flavour - skills right there.

Dessert
The dessert....hmm..looks nice but that's it. I really would have preferred something else. We ordered coffee (french press, I think it costs like $7 and fills 3.5 cups). Ladies and gentleman, one of the best coffee I've tasted - smooth, dark, and it's not Starbucks.

Verdict: Worth coming for lunch (no doubt). I love the decor, service was great (except near the end) and the dishes surprised us. It won't leave you feeling starved so you are eating your money's worth. I don't want to rate it just yet, will need to re-assess with a regular menu."}
{"text":"Bosk!!! You are too good to me. Located in the Shangrila hotel this chic spot gives an Asian spin on modern North American cuisine (including seafood!!) Pictured is their clam chowder which was to die for!! The server suggested a wine pairing that was perfect for my dish! I love the vibe and atmosphere. This was my favourite winterlicious restaurant. I also got the Bespoke Grass Fed Beef which is 6 oz of 40 day dry aged ribeye  It was served to perfection!!! To see video of the steak you can take a look at my Instagram: @morenoms__"}
{"text":"Love it here. Great ambiance and fabulous staff. The food is wonderful fusion of western and Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and all the dishes looked beautiful, but the taste just wasn't worth what they charged. 

We waited a really long time for our bread. The waiter came by to tell us our bread would be out shortly as they had to warm it up. When the bread finally came out, it was stone cold.

The octopus was over-seasoned and the maple date cake was overwhelmingly sweet. We got the sablefish and duck for the mains, which were decent but didn't wow us."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner on a Saturday night. We made a reservation thinking that it would be pretty full but the restaurant was half empty at 7pm. 

Atmosphere: 5/5
- I love the interior design of the restaurant. It's super simple yet elegant. 
- not too loud... definitely an intimate place for a special date! 
- love their choice of background music 

Food: 4/5 
- butter for the complimentary bread is sooo good. They put some sort Indian spice in there. 
- we ordered the torched hamachi ($19) as a starter. It was also very good. The flavours really compliment each other and the sashimi was very fresh. Overall I would recommend this dish if you like something light to start off.  
- butter poached lobster with beet was our 2nd starter. It was plated really well but they only gave two small pieces of lobster for $28. Although the beet purée pairs well with the lobster I found the lobster was on the undercooked side
- pan roasted Atlantic halibut ($38): very light and herbal paired with the sweetness from the grapes and pommes purée. The fish is cooked very well and the potato purée goes well with the dish!
- 40 days dry aged strip-loin ($48): a very tough cut of meat. It definitely has that funky taste of dry aged meat but a little over seasoned. Very flavourful! I was impressed with their house made prosciutto though! 

Service: 3.5/5
- the staff was very friendly and approachable however when our waiter came to take our order he interrupted my date so that I can order first
- we didn't have to wait too long for food but the bread did take a while for them to serve and for the bill to come in the end
- it was very nice of them to ask if we wanted more bread tho!

Overall we would recommend getting the torched hamachi for starter and halibut!"}
{"text":"A group of us came here to try their Summerlicious dinner menu.

Overall Impression: 

Bosk aims to please; a fine choice for date night or girls' night out. The service was superb, the drinks were made well, and the vibe was relaxed yet sophisticated. The waiters do their best to ensure you're comfortable and happy, and it really shows. 

The Food:

The food was, for the most part, delicious. 

My favourite was the corn soup, which was sweet and had some crunch (spicy granola) to it. I definitely recommend getting this as an appetizer. One of us had the halibut as a main course. It was out of this world, and so, I recommend this as well.

Three of us had the beef shortrib as our main, and all three of us were thoroughly disappointed with it. The beef was overdone and lacked flavour. The rest of the dish was fine, but the beef was the important part. When asked whether we were enjoying our main courses, one of us told the waiter about the beef. The waiter insisted that the beef was supposed to taste dry, but offered to replace it with another dish. We declined as we already ate half, and did not want to put the poor guy through replacing three plates. We received several offers to replace the beef, which attests to the superb service at Bosk. My point is, the service is fantastic, and don't order the beef. Don't do it. 

The dessert was lovely. The chocolate mousse was a winner, and so were the peaches and cream, which included realistic looking white chocolate pearls. Impressive attention to detail!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday. We had an amazing time. Our server Emily was very accommodating to our needs. Very friendly and great atmosphere. The food is a bit pricey but if you want quality, the food is 5 stars! We had a 3 course meal and each course was cooked and seasoned perfectly. If you guys want fine dining, I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Bosk is the bomb of 2017 Summerlicious. For $28 lunch ($37 after tax and tips), I was floored by their super delicious three course selections! They had complimentary fresh warm bread with this olive butter spread to start. You can tell the food quality at a restaurant when their bread and butter were good. I'm so glad that Bosk didn't cheap out on this like so many other top notch Summerlicious restaurants. 

Appetizer (Must get): Top Tomato Farms Broccoli OR Carpaccio (raw) of Beef Tenderloin
I chose the broccoli soup for appetizer and the richness reminded me of the soups from Soup Nutsy. The twist was the lager mix, which blended nicely with the pumpernickel and broccoli and gave the soup its fusion taste. A couple of my friends chose the Carpaccio (raw) beef, the other popular appetizer to get if you don't want something too rich and heavy. 

Main: Fresh Duck Egg Linguine (must get)
A bit on the heavy side due to the added buttermilk but still very worthy to try here. Green sauce was amazing and the egg was supposedly cooked in with the linguine. The crunchy chicken dish and albacore tuna were well received by my friends. Needless to say, all of our plates were spot clean at the end!

Dessert: Flourless chocolate biscuit plus passion fruit sorbet. Who can say no to passion fruit sorbet?! This is a must get dessert at Bosk. The passion fruit sorbet cleansed my tongue and prepared it for the chocolate biscuit, which tasted more like chocolate cake. If you want something less rich, choose the light vanilla mousse with strawberries.

Service: I was very surprised at how quickly they served our food as we came in as a group of 9 and managed to finish below the two hour mark. Again, they did not discriminate us as the \"Summerlicious\" customers and was very attentive whenever we needed something. We even got sparkling water without additional charges! Note: the washrooms here are outside the restaurant and shared with the hotel. They use L'occitane handsoaps! :D

This is my second time coming here but first time trying the Summerlicious. I could taste the chefs passion in the foods as a regular customer and Summerlicious customer. Will for sure return in the future!"}
{"text":"I dined at Bosk for breakfast and dinner during my recent stay and had a great experience - top notch staff serving high quality food.  For breakfast I enjoyed the wellness menu and enjoyed it very much - egg white omelette with spinach.  For dinner, I enjoyed a pear salad, butternut squash agnolotti and panna cotta - all ingredients were so fresh and the dishes were beyond flavorful.  This place is certainly a culinary treat!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! We liked every dish served at our Sunday brunch (post family wedding). Chicken and waffles eggs benny was the highlight. Service was not attentive, rigid, and slow. We had a large group (25 plus) with one man server.. doesn't seem right! Anyways.. expected better service for such a nice place!"}
{"text":"Bosk lounge was great but Bosk restaurant was ok.....   The restaurant had limited menu choices and the food was good but not great.  For the price I expected better... Not that it's bad but it just didn't feel like it's worth 150.00 per person."}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed my first experience at Bosk for summerlicious lunch! The atmosphere was amazing and the servers were very friendly and helpful - would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant twice for lunch and once for dinner. Every time it was a very pleasant experience.

The restaurant is very beautifully decorated. The service was very attentive.

All the dishes were nicely presented. They had a very good mix of textures from different ingredients and all were delicious! The seasoning was spot on. You could taste the freshness of the ingredients. 

The menu is not long, which doesn't offer lots of selections. But it includes seafood, meat and veggie options."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. Started dinner with the beet and proscuitto appetizer which was light and very tasteful and the arctic char (absolutely horrible). Next we got the lobster gnocchi and oxtail and wild mushroom, which was absolutely to die for. These two were small second course plates but were packed with so much flavor, especially the oxtail. Ended the night with the dark chocolate mousse desert, which was also great. Our waiter was very friendly and funny. At one point he fell really behind as he had 5 tables so he gave us our desert and two cappuccinos for free (foamy and perfect), which was a nice gesture. Overall I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby on a Monday night for the Travelzoo dinner special (https://www.travelzoo.com/ca/local-deals/Toronto/Restaurant/240052/Shangri-La/).  I've heard so many good things about this hotel that I was very eager and excited to check it out. Our reservation was at 5:30pm but we were early so the hostess asked us to come back in a few minutes. She was very polite and friendly. I ordered the Pink Lady cocktail while my hubby had red wine with his meal. The service was very good - the server was attentive and gave us  sufficient time to review the menu.  We ordered the scallops to start and they were cooked to perfection right through to the centre. We were really impressed. It didn't taste rubbery like some other places. The presentation of the food was average but the taste was really good and filling even though the portions looked small. My hubby had the Ribeye and I had Salmon.  The meat of the Ribeye was very tender and had good flavor. The salmon was pretty good too but it wasn't the best I've had. The dessert was very good. I ordered the Chestnut and Espresso for dessert and the vanilla sponge mixed in with the chestnut was just the right amount of sweetness along with the tasty Espresso ice cream really hit the spot. And I'm not a chestnut kind of person...."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. Food was very good! Ambiance was lovely. It was a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I recently tried out this place recently for a birthday and to say the least- was very impressed! Service was very good, food was delicious (had the lamb) and wine was excellent. The environment felt very cozy and friendly which is exactly the type of environment I love, no loud music to interrupt the conversation and it didn't feel TOO busy that we felt like we were being rushed for dinner. 

The only downside is that as nice as our waiter was- he didn't really know how to pour wine- however I'm pretty sure he was new so it just takes time! 

FOod was delicious and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time the food is absolutely excellent. I really recommend their salmon - it's so flavourful!

The atmosphere is really nice because it's located within the Shangri-La Hotel. When it gets chillier at night, they have heat lamps outside on the patio which is really great. 

My only drawback was the service my second time around. While it was summerlicious at the time, my party asked for the normal menu instead and it took about 20 minutes to figure out where to find us a normal menu. Still, I understand the request must have been a little out of the ordinary at the time. 

Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Best Summerlicious Lunch meal 

Light delicious meal.  

Coming back for sure 
Will add the details later"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious -- had a wonderful time. The appetizers were very light and small in portion but came with warm bread. The salmon was tender and flavoured lightly but the sides were the perfect complement. 

The dessert was the real highlight -- delicately garnished with small flowers -- and with a real array of choice. Chocolate mousse seemed a bit messy in presentation but delicious to all. Mango pudding was my personal favourite because it was paired with a sour gelato on top and a more neutral tapioca pudding below for textural variety. The almond cake was nice, but not particularly memorable. 

Really enjoyed the atmosphere -- it was just the right volume for conversation -- and, of course, the hotel is beautiful. My only caveat is that they were unable to split the bill because we had a party of six."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. The restaurant itself has great ambience and fantastic service. We were seated inside but I noticed that they have their back patio area well decorated for the holiday season with heated fireplaces, faux fur trimmings, Christmas trees and lights. Definitely will have to come back for some drinks out there. 
I ordered the \"East Coast\" which was poached eggs with lobster, caviar, on a croissant. It was decent. I wasn't completely blown away by the food, just satisfied. But none the less still a very beautiful brunch. 
After our late brunch I went to the lobby for a glass of wine. They had a live pianist playing and it completely set the mood.
So come for the ambience, come for the service, come to take beautiful pictures."}
{"text":"Summerlicious review - definitely exceeded expectations and would recommend! Menu had a good variety to cater to different preferences for our table of 7 and I would say that we all really enjoyed the food and experience.

Appetizer - would recommend the sweet corn soup. Perfect balance of sweet and savory. 

Main dish - if you are a meat eater, the striploin was cooked on the rare side and there was a generous portion. The halibut was nicely seared but I enjoyed my friends forest mushroom agnolotti the most out of all the mains. So full of mushroom flavour and seasoned perfectly.

Dessert - our table had the unanimous agreement that the poached niagara peach was the best dessert that night.

Overall great ambience (the patio looked really legit) and service was excellent. What more could you expect from summerlicious?"}
{"text":"Food quality and service and desert  was good but the food was too bland!! Bread served in the beginning was cold!! Didnt like lamb, it was too raw!! Fish needed salt and chicken was too dry? So probably last time coming here and no more Sumerlicious for me!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: romantic. We were placed in front of the fireplace, the most romantic spot in the restaurant. Dim, not too quiet, not too loud. Decorations on table were alright, room decorations were great. Perfect for business meetings and casual date night.

Service: this is what stood out to me the most. Server was hilarious, romantic, eloquent, understanding, and most importantly caters to your needs. Perfect. You ask and they will have an answer - they live up to their words. They make you feel at home and not feel obligated to ask or do anything. They make you feel royalty by being showing their utmost politeness and care. You will feel prioritized. We were moved to the lounge at the end of the course to enjoy live music. Expectations exceeded for an upscale restaurant.

Food: just perfect. Chef brought my main course, 10/10 on that part. A different flavour on each bite, everything perfectly cooked. Not too much, not too mediocre. Mushrooms were great. Overall was delicious. Will try more.

Overall was an excellent experience. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful afternoon tea with a friend and client and feel happy. Service impeccable but almost a little to discrete. A second pot of hot tea would be appropriate based on price. Scones were warm but hated the recipe. Despite a few issues, live music fabulous, atmosphere quiet and enjoyable. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an impressive dining experience here at Bosk. Beautiful interior, incredibly professional and welcoming servers / hosts, live music, and really good food! Super worthwhile for Summerlicious. 

We got to try all of the below which were ALL very good; the absolute standouts are denoted with (**):

Kale and Cherry Tomato Salad (Torn sourdough, purple and green beans, Parmesan vinaigrette)
(**) Carpaccio of Beef Tenderloin (Pickled summer vegetables, grain mustard, birch syrup

(**)Fisherfolk Swordfish \"Nicoise\" (Confit tuna, potato pave, soft-boiled egg, olives, bagna cauda, frisee)
36 hour Lamb Shoulder (Chickpeas, charred eggplant, feta, spiced jus)

(**)Light vanilla mousse (Orange blossom sponge, fresh strawberries)
Flourless chocolate biscuit (Milk chocolate cremeux, crunchy nougatine, passion fruit sorbet)

Notably, what was impressive was the sheer EFFICIENCY of the server team in clearing up an accidental spill. 3 servers came in one after the other to clear up the wine (and later refilled it), mop up the floor, and replace the napkin, plate, and cutlery."}
{"text":"Today was a perfect day!  I got my yelp elite badge and I had a wonderful dinner at Bosk for Summerlicious.  I am very happy that Toronto are doing Summerlicious AND Winterlicious annually and a lot of restaurants are participating.  This is great for all the average foodie like me out there, because to be honest, some of the restaurants on the list, I do not think you would ever think of going to grab a regular dinner or lunch because of the extremely high prices!

Bosk is located inside Shangri-La and in order to get to the restaurant, you must walk through Shangri-La and the moment my friend and I walked it, we literally said wow, because of how beautiful the place was.  As a bonus, they had a live singer singing in the lobby which was fantastic!

Once at Bosk, The hostess was very polite and upon providing her the reservation information, she immediately sat us down at a beautiful table at the back.  The server for the table was super friendly and attentive.  Dispute being Summerlicious and not ordering any alcoholic drinks, the server was still super friendly and professional.

Dinner for two and we ordered the below items to share:
Heirloom Tomato Soup - Appetizer
Seared Albacore Tuna

Roasted Flat Iron Steak - Main
Soy Glazed Pork Belly - Main

Dark Chocolate Mousse - Dessert
Mango Pudding - Dessert

Out of all the dishes, I was super impressed with the Seared Albacore Tuna, Iron Steak and the Dark Chocolate Mousse.  All the food were presented very nicely, but those three just tasted even better!  I want to point out the Soup is actually a chill soup and for me, I think it was too sour, so I didn't really like it.

The tuna was semi-raw and topped with lime dressing, which brought out the freshness of the tuna.
The steak was made to perfection, it was very juicy and easy to chew!
The Dark Chocolate Mousse was nicely presented and it tasted really good although it felt a little heavy.
The Pork Belly was tasty also, but I thought it was overcooked just a little so it was a little rough, however, I thought the chef did a great job on choosing the miso broth as sauce and it mixed in very well the pork belly!
Mango pudding, well, they had the lime sorbet on top and it was too sour for me, so I didn't really enjoy it.  But I am very sensitive when it comes to sourness, so if you are into sour food, it might be a good choice for you.

Overall the experience was great, the reason why I gave it a 4 stars out of 5 instead of 5 of 5 is because the menu for lunch and dinner are pretty much the same, but dinner is $20 more, I thought by paying the extra, they would provide more choices for appetizers and desserts.  If you are planning to try this place during Summerlicious, I recommend visiting during lunch time to save the additional $20 per person which you can put on drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious 2018 lunch. I ordered soup, gnocchi and warm toffe pudding. My husband got the pork shoulder spread, duck confit and the cheesecake. Sorry I can not recall those French names. We both tried each other's plates and are amazed by all of them. The duck confit is not that salty like in other French restaurants eg. Le Select Bistro. The way they cook the gnocchi is quite different than I had in other places too. They pan pried the gnocchi first and then put the sauce on the top rather then mixing the sauce and boiled gnocchi together. This results a layer of the light crispy skin on the gnocchi. For the desert, ginger icecream on the top of the warm pudding is a really good mixture of tastes. The ginger taste is pretty strong. I also like the cheesecake, it's not too sweet and you can kinda taste the real cheese flavor. Their complimentary bread is quite interesting. Forget those dry and hard chewing bread, these breads are like Chinese steamed bun with moisture texture and herbs inside. We ate them all with the honey butter provided. I will definitely come to try more stuff on their daily menu on special occasions! BTW, service is quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I made a last minute summerlicious reservation at Bosk for lunch and I am so glad that I had checked OpenTable late the night before. This restaurant was pretty much the only restaurant I wanted to go to as I have been to a lot of the restaurants on the summerlicious list.
We arrived at Bosk at 12 and we were quickly seated by the window. The server was great as he quickly came with water and had this really cool pouring technique which was quite interesting. As usual, I asked the server for recommendations and he was very knowledgeable. We both had the seared tuna to start as I was not quite interested with the other items since I wanted to know how well they would prepare the fish. The fish dish was super refreshing since it was served with a lime dressing- nicely done as it is definitely a good choice for the summer time.
I chose the entree our server had recommended- the salmon and was cooked to perfection and delicious. The other entree was the steak and it was tender and cooked perfectly at medium rare. That would definitely be my next choice to order. 
For dessert, I had the dark chocolate mousse and yet again you can never go wrong with chocolate, especially with some coffee flavours and condensed milk. The mango pudding was quite good too since it was served with a lime sorbet- again super refreshing for a summer dessert. I really liked how they had sago paired with the mango pudding itself since being asian, I love this stuff lol!

Recap of the items:

Appetizer
Seared Albacore Tuna

Entree
Lois Lake Steelhead Salmon
Roasted Flat Iron Steak

Dessert
Dark Chocolate Mousse
Mango Pudding

The dining experience was top notch as I would expect at a 5-star hotel. I really enjoyed it as the server was super friendly. Food was excellent and value was definitely amazing.
I would not mind coming back for the regular menu- looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"The Bosk was one of the participants for summerlicious 2013!
You can't help but gaze at the fancy uber decor of the place, as you enter from their exquisitely designed lobby, beautiful fire place, transparent fountain platform and wooden furnishings lies the BOSK. Crystal green shaded glass lamps, long granite bar counter, and wine rack walls, the Bosk gives this place a classy aura.

getting down to the good stuff, their foods.

Country Pate 4/5
Pork pate / apricot / mustard / artisan bread
I've had pate before, so it was necessary to try it at the BOSK. First off beautifully presented on a porcelain board, the sweetness of the appricot seeds, and tangy mustard really helped bring this dish together, and created a diversification of flavors!


Pacific Salmon 5/5
gold potato/ sweet peas / corn / romaine / citrus emulsion 
Probably the best Pacific Salmon I've ever had.  A beautifully light charr on the outside followed by the well cooked tender salmon was nothing less than perfection.
Each entity of the dish had its own flavorful component. Romaine and sweet peas had a light buttery flavor, whilst the citrus emulsion brought the citrusy-sweet component to the salmon and potatos.  Overall creativity, and presentation was superbly demonstrated.


Niagara Peaches 5/5
citrus cake / darjeeling cream / bourbon syrup / brown butter crumble.
Darjeeling cream really helped offset the sweet and aromatic flavors of the citrus cake and bourbon syrup melody. In addition the brown butter crunch was icing on the cake that unified this dessert."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went there for their summerlicious dinner menu. It was a great dinner. The staffs were friendly and the service was excellent.

The plating of the food was so beautiful, even my friend wanted to bring the plate home... And the most importantly, the food tasted really good as well.

If you haven't been to Bosk before, you should definitely give their summerlicious or winterlicious menu a chance =)"}
{"text":"I went to Bosk as a treat after writing a big exam, and it was WONDERFUL. We had the lunch set menu - my starter was the smoked lentil soup and my main was the sous vide chicken with celeriac. It was fairly expensive after drinks ($67) but really top notch in terms of quality and overall deliciousness! Would definitely go again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"A great find. Very nice atmosphere.  Modern,oriental feel. The staff was so accommodating, so helpful.  The menu was very unique. I had the sablefish. It was the most light, fluffy fish that I have ever had. The sauce, veggies and light,thin fries were all great.  The lobster and gnocchi appetizer was amazing. Stephen was our waiter.  Such great service.  Great find."}
{"text":"We went to Bosk for their Christmas Day brunch. It was perfect in every way. The service was friendly, the food was delicious and they even had a magician there to mesmerize the kids. Bosk is a beautiful location and the table settings with Christmas crackers was a nice touch. I'm sure a lot of work went into organizing such a perfect event and it was appreciated! This is the best brunch experience I have had in Toronto. Really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Bosk gives winterlicious a good name. Whereas some restos cheap out a little, there are no shortcuts here. The complimentary fresh bread with specialty housemade butter, the excellent service, and the great food selections available... If you are a coffee-lover, order a cup - the french press and the hot steamed milk are lovely touches."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation, she said the food was amazing, but my experience was different. It could be that her recommendation was for the seafood. The decoration of the interior dining area was average, the lighting is a bit wierd in the afternoon during the summer. Appetizer was the best tasting part of the meal, seared rouge foie gras was really good, I usually don't like beans but they tasted okay with the foie gras, the server was very kind to split the dish onto 2 separate plates. For the mains, the 40 day aged striploin was nothing special, dry and flavorless, although my cousin liked it. The lamb looked pretty cool, but it had a gamey flavor, which I didn't like. It was especially disappointing for me due to my friend's high recommendation and I just had amazing lamb from Canoe few days ago. By the way I came to the restaurant in May"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast at Bosk while staying in Toronto. The atmosphere was quiet. The decor of the restaurant is modern. I ordered the Mushroom and Spinach Benedict and my husband ordered the French Toast. The food was spectacularly displayed and succulent. The coffee was pressed and poured at our table. The waitstaff was professional and provided recommendations as requested. I would highly recommend this location for breakfast to friends and family members who are visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here on NYE (Dec. 31, 2014) with one another. 

I had called ahead two days prior as I was having difficulty booking online. I had explained to the lady on the phone that we were guests staying at the Shangri-la hotel and that I was having difficulty booking. She took my name and penciled us in for 5:30pm on Dec. 31, 2014.

When we arrived for our reservation at 5:30pm, but it seemed like the hostess that I had spoken to two days prior did not record the actual reservation. I explained to the hostess what had happened over the phone, but she was unable to find it. She searched frantically before pulled another worker to do the same. The manager came by and she explained the situation. He then asked me to repeat the details and searched the same screen that the original hostess had searched. After a few minutes, they decided to get us a table, more off to the side, in a little alley-ish portion of the restaurant. Whatever, no biggie.

We tried the NYE early dinner menu (~5:30pm) with the wine pairings (179.00/person without tax/gratuities). Our total bill was nearly $500.00 with tax and tip.  If you're looking for a dinner where you really want to \"go big\" or \"spurge\", then this is definitely it. Although, having been to another upscale restaurant similar to BOSK the night before, my overall rating is a bit biased, as it totally outweighed BOSK on every platform.

I can definitely say that the wine pairings that they chose for each course were absolutely exquisite. We tried many different things: caviar donuts, lobster gnocchi, roasted Ontario venison loin, and this chocolate-based dish they called \"sweet ending\".

The caviar donut wasn't really my cup of tea. I don't really have much to say about it. They coated it in different things, but it wasn't really anything that complimented the taste.

The lobster gnocchi was absolutely fantastic. I like lobster, though it isn't usually my first choice when I go out to eat. I can definitely say that I now have a new found love for lobster. 

The roasted Ontario venison loin was also very good. The gravy/sauce was a bit bland for such a large hunk of meat. Take a sip of the wine first before you try it to give the food a bit of a kick.

Sweet endings weren't too sweet - which is nice for those who aren't huge sugar fans.

If there's anything I can say about the menu: when coming to BOSK, come with an open mind. Note that if you're not a fan of seafood, this place may not be for you, as it heavily surrounded by Asian Canadian influence.

The service otherwise was fantastic - with each course, the presentation of what you are eating was nicely done. With each wine and course, we got a little bit of information about what were eating/drinking, as well as where it came from."}
{"text":"If you pass up this place, you'll regret it.

Came here for a work lunch on a whim with 5 others for a work celebration and couldn't of made a better choice. Walking in, the decor and servers and welcoming and seated us near a window with gusto.

SWORDFISH \"NIÇOISE\" - juicy bits of swordfish with a chickpea, olive blend on the side was exactly what I needed to refuel from lunch. It is filling, but still light and doesn't leave you too full. Every bite was worth to savour for this dish.

The restaurant has large ground to ceiling window walls, but even for a rainy day, it still managed to look elegant, like something out of an old film.

I would love to come here during dinner not only for their menu, but just to see how beautiful it can be. Just be ready with your phone once you step into the boujee Bosk."}
{"text":"Came here today for New Year's Eve dinner. I am really satisfied with the quality of the food, the presentation and the service. Will definitely be returning here to try their brunch. Love love love this place! I rate Bosk a good 12/10!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!

My friends and I came here as part of \"Summerlicious\" and we can't say enough good things about it.
The atmosphere was very nice, the service was outstanding and the food was to die for.
With 3 courses for $48 and 3 glasses of wine to accompany these it was a steal!

Smoked Ontario trout and corn soup appetizers were exquisite. The trout literarily melted in our mouths.
Nova Scotia halibut as main entree was really great too.
We tried all 3 desserts and the poached Niagara peaches and cherries was definitely our favorite.
The bittersweet chocolate mousse was good and while the cheese plate was decent, we regretted not having ordered 1 extra portion of preaches & cherries instead.
Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious with my friend and everything was absolutely delicious.  We ordered one of the cheaper bottles of wine, but it wasn't in stock so the manager came over apologizing profusely and offered us a more expensive bottle at the same price.  I was very impressed and wasn't expecting that at all!  

Our meals were light, fresh and delicious. Everything was presented so beautifully and tasted ever better.  The service was fantastic - friendly, attentive and well put together.

I love the simple decor.  It was bright and spacious; good for a couple of a big group.

It's a tad on the pricier side, but well worth it.  If you want to save a buck, try the summerlicious or winterlicious menus which are equally tasty as the regular menu."}
{"text":"Came here for $25 Summerlicious Lunch. Located in the main floor of the beautiful Shangri-La hotel, the restaurant itself is quite simple and plain for a 5 star hotel, but still comfortable with an organic feel. Service could be improved (eg. bus boy, reception - no smile, rude)

Seared Albacore Tuna 
- Great tuna, very light colored, paired with lime dressing
- Not a fan of the peanuts pairing or rice noodle though

Heirloom Tomato Soup 
- had a few sips and wow! bursting with tomato flavor! It was very good and surprisng; not sour, but rather the fresh taste of natural tomatoes

Flat Iron Steak 
- Nice salty crust on the steak and cooked to medium rare, juicy
- Fan of polenta fritter (although the batter was a bit thick for my personal taste)
- Love the daikon in the sweet sauce
- Again oriental fusion with the green onion

Salmon w couscous, tomato
- salmon was bland
- couscous was ok though, again with the fresh, flavorful heirloom tomatoes

Dark Chocolate Mousse 
- Beautiful presentation, looked like a plant in a glass, added touch with the purple flowers
- Not a fan of chocolate mousse but this was well balanced with the crumbles and I really enjoyed it!

Mango Pudding w sago, lime sorbet, coconut crisp
- Mango pudding was dense, but good paired with the sour lime sorbet (warning: very sour! But refreshing pairing so I didn't mind)
 
Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food (taste, presentation and innovation!) Worth checking out for $25 lunch."}
{"text":"I enjoyed summerlious with BOSK. However I found it overprice for what we're getting.

Decent service, good quality food, okay ambience. 

For $28 per person, we got 3 prefix lunch.
I got broccoli soup, crunchy chicken breast and chocolate cookies for dessert.

I loved the broccoli soup, it was extremely tasteful. Crunchy chicken is creative, but I thought it tasted average. Chocolate cookies were a bit sweet for me but I can't blame them because most Western desserts are sweet. 

For me it's a bit step when they charged $7 for a green tea for one. Especially when they ask \"would you like to have some tea or water?\" I thought it was complimentary."}
{"text":"#summerlicious# lovely place?good service?delicious food?poached niagara peach is the best dessert ever had?"}
{"text":"I booked Bosk to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The ambience is very cozy and the décor is minimalistic with wood work on the ceiling and crisp white linen on the tables. The service truly matched the high calibre of the restaurant's food and décor. Our waiter Stephan was very attentive to all our needs and was very knowledgeable about the champagnes chilled and served from the bar cart and wine list. He recommended I try to lobster gnocchi to start. They were absolutely divine - butter poached lobster claw and tail over a bed of micro gnocchi. Everything just melted in my mouth. For dinner, I went with the chicken. Only at the Shangri - La can they make chicken breast a culinary masterpiece. The star of the dish was the chicken, embellished with delicious garnishes that really enhanced the whole flavour of the dish. My friend raved about the pea soup and his pasta dish. They both looked so pleasing to the eyes. For dessert we each had the chocolate tart. It was very luxurious-tasting and my friend got his served with a lit candle in celebration of his birthday. At the end of our meal, Stephan accompanied the bill with white chocolate pearls, strawberry truffles and rosewater jellies in a dish. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend Bosk for those seeking to surprise their pallet."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and were treated to amazing service, great food and sophisticated ambience. We had the sweetbreads and hamachi for starters followed by perfectly prepared sablefish and ribeye. Jean-Michael was our server and was attentive, funny and thoughtful. He noticed my wife was pregnant and brought out a nice non-alcoholic drink as I enjoyed my old-fashion. When he heard we were celebrating our anniversary he took the fabulous chocolate dessert off the bill. Some times fine dinning doesn't live up to expectations, but Bosk certainly did. Amazing night!"}
{"text":"We visited the Bar twice with live music on Friday evening and today (Monday) evening we absolutely loved the place. The employees are so sweet and professional. We even took a selfie with them lol 

The bar tender makes the best drinks. We went to different bars throughout the 5 nights but the best one was this place. Thanks Alexandra for making our evening in a wonderful one! And to the bartenders (Kevin) for the yummy drinks with the right amount of alcohol"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here last Saturday to try their Easter Brunch Menu. We've dined at Bosk before and so we already knew that they would have exceptional food and service.

Bosk's Easter weekend brunch menu included two courses at $39 per person, which came with fresh juice, coffee or tea. Their menu was quite extensive with a variety of different starters and mains to choose from. Dessert was not included in the price, but for $7 guests can choose from the dessert list. For those looking to enjoy mimosas with their meal, a server will come around with a beverage cart offering juice, champagne and mimosas (mimosas are $22 per glass).

My bf ordered the Caesar salad and I ordered the cheese and charcuterie board as my starter. I wasn't expecting a big platter, so when it came out I was surprised to see so many different sides to go with the cheese and meat. There wasn't one item on this board that I didn't like because it all tasted so good! I especially loved the roasted candied walnuts which paired nicely with the cheese. I shared this with my bf since it was too much for me to finish.

We both ordered the steak and eggs main course. The steak was cooked to a beautiful medium rare that was extremely tender and flavourful, and the eggs were cooked sunny side up which was very rich and silky. The Yukon gold potatoes were seasoned with smokey flavours and had a crispy texture on the outside. There were supposed to be cherry tomatoes based on the menu, but we didn't receive any and we didn't notice until after we looked at the menu for dessert.

For dessert, our waitress told us about their macaron special, 6 for $10, so we ordered some to finish off our delicious meal (she put in an extra macaron for us!). The macarons were very tasty and my favourite was their hazelnut. It would have been better if they were refrigerated before serving because the macarons were a bit too soft.

Overall, we had a great experience trying Bosk's brunch menu from their outstanding food to their wonderful service. The total cost of our meal was $229.39 plus gratuity, which turned out to be an expensive brunch because we kind of went crazy on the mimosas without knowing the price (lol)! We will definitely come back again in the future, but probably take it easy on the mimosas!"}
{"text":"BOSK was amazing dining experience. Check it out during one of the 'Licious event if the usual price point is too steep for you, it's definitely worth it. The food is well executed with multiple layers of textures and flavors. There is attention to detail and presentation. I still think of their beef carpaccio even after all these months. I was able to taste a little of every dish at the table and every single one of them was delicious. You can't go wrong with your choices here. A definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Bosk, a perfect restaurant for dating!  Best service in town. We had a new year eve 6 course tasting menu.  Start off with the caviar, then foie gras, lobster tail, risotto, ribeye and chocolate cake for dessert. The portion is very small, but the quality is high. I would definitely go again and try out their regular dinner menu."}
{"text":"The highlight of our Toronto dining experience!
We were staying across the street at the Toronto Hilton--yes, I know--ghetto, compared to the sublime Shangri-la hotel.  We decided to stop by the much lauded Shangri-la for a late lunch.  
Every item we ordered was a delight.  Flavor! Flavor! Flavor! Thank you Bosk for a divine lunch experience.  I will admit, we were looking a little shabby, and the hostess was not as enamored with us...oh well.  Fortunately, we're enormous tippers (for good service) and our delightful waitress..Charroll??? was superb.
Bosk Burger- Amazing Flavor
Bread - Artisan and habit forming- some of the best!
Whipped olive oil and garlic - pure heaven.
Bravo Bosk!"}
{"text":"Really average food, really overpriced for what it is. The food is really bland, soup tastes like it came out of a Campbell's can. I think it's just for the name of eating in the Shangri-La but I'd much rather spend my money on a restaurant that makes my belly happy."}
{"text":"This is a on their almond croissant only.

Bosk is located inside the Shangri-La Hotel.  I was too tired from the night before to properly get ready to have breakfast downstairs so I asked if I can get a pastry for take out.  They weren't sure since I'm assuming not many people ask to get a container to go, but they were accommodating.  

I took my almond croissant and brought it upstairs to my room with coffee.  I'm not sure if I was really hungry, but that croissant was damn good."}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicious. The staff was prompt and courteous, the food was delicious, and the overall experience was wonderful.

I ordered the smoked trout for appetizer, albacore tuna for main, and peach panna cotta for dessert - the food was made just right! My mom had the salad for appetizer, beef for main and cheese platter for dessert and she absolutely loved it.

Seating was far apart, tables were large, decor was modern. Overall a great experience and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Shangri-La for a wedding over a weekend recently, and with Bosk - a fine-looking dining establishment - in the lobby, it made it easy not to think too hard about where to grab some food or a drink. It is open quite late, and with an outdoors patio that has fireplaces turned on for cool summer nights, it can be a very chill place to hang out despite being right at street level in the heart of downtown Toronto. Inside has the feel of a clean-cut, Asian-influenced dining space (lots of light wood on the walls and common tables out front), matching the general ambiance that the hotel gives off. Service was mixed - pretty good for brunch, when it was less crowded, but less attentive when we came for cocktails late Friday night. Nonetheless, that's not a gating issue that should prevent you from coming to visit.

The cocktails, surprisingly, were the weaker aspect of what we experienced here. While the beef tartare was good and incorporated a lot of herbs and dots of mustard, making for a very nice late-night bar snack, the cocktails were always strong on the liquor, and I was quite disappointed in the gin and honey cocktail...the burnt honey didn't work very well with the gin, creating a bit of a clash flavor-wise. Brunch, however, was excellent. 'Bennys' are big in Canada, and the East Coast - with a hollandaise that reeked (in a good way) of lobster and topped with a little caviar, was absolutely divine. My wife went with the 'Morning After', and aside from being a very generous helping of breakfast food, all of the meats (especially the more American-style smoked bacon) were delicious. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the experience a couple nights prior, the drink was again the weak spot - the local craft IPA was too light and a tad bitter given the lightness...perhaps the local breweries need to improve their game!

Despite the booze I had not being my favorite (there is a very healthy wine collection that I did not sample at all from), the food was generally excellent, and for those looking for modern Canadian cuisine (which seems pretty much the same as modern American), you won't come away disappointed. Even if you aren't staying in the Shangri-La, Bosk is worth a visit for a proper meal, although it does have a nice vibe for the late night as well."}
{"text":"My first visit to Bosk was during winterlicous. It gave a small taste of what the restaurant has to offer. My selections were sea worthy and I was not disappointed. 

Although it was a Monday night it was relatively busy. I was impressed by the generous amount of coffee offered. 

Granted, this is fine dining so be prepared to pay a bit more."}
{"text":"Got to try out Bosk for winterlicious, and I must say it was a good decision in choosing this place. I never came here before but the dinner menu sounded really good. 

If any restaurant is located in the Shangri-la hotel it's usually pretty expensive. As expected once upon arriving at the restaurant the front desk welcomed me and my guest and took our jackets. 

The ambiance of the restaurant has nice modern interior design with dim lighting. For me it was a bit too dim haha.. felt like sitting in the dark for dinner with only a small candle for light lol... Service was very good as well they are very knowledgeable about all the ingredients that goes into each dish. 

Appetizer:  Chicken Velouté Confit chicken, orzo, truffle, brioche (it was a soup) 
Main: Grilled Beef Shortrib Bone broth, water chestnut, snowpea, taro
Dessert: Ricotta Galette B-wall honey poached cranberries, pear gelée, spiced pecan. 

The short ribs was really good! The meat was grilled nicely and very tender. Lots of flavor and juicy. The taro was also quite interesting as well. Good taste and not too overpowering with the batter. 

The dessert was very good as well. Really enjoyed the ricotta galette with the fruit. The pecans give the dessert a good isolation taste as it gives your tastebuds a break from the sweetness. 

Delicious and cool winterlicious experience. Good food and service."}
{"text":"What an elegant, non-rushed evening.  My partner and I opted for Bosk over another highly recommended venue which had set a time limit on our stay.  We were impressed by the refined non-intrusive service and the variety of foods on the tasting menu.

We opted for selected wine pairings as we have had the experience of too much wine with a full pairing menu.  There were plenty of surprises along the way.  A nice complimentary glass of bubbly for our anniversary. One of the pairing with the beef dish for my partner who has a distaste for red wine was a white from 1846 - pre-civil war.  Amazed by the taste and colour.  

Our male waiter was professional, the additional servers at the table were non-intrusive.  One of the first times in Toronto that we have experienced service for the two of us that was exceptional.  My partner has hosted many private dining room dinners with great service, but on our return for a 2 person dinner, service has been extremely disappointing, bar none in Toronto.

Bosk, for those special evenings where you want to have a leisurely, refined tastes and an elegant setting. 

It lives up to the 5-star rating and the chef was complimented many times during the meal.  BRAVO."}
{"text":"Pricey, yes. Be prepared to shell out some.

But the food is very flavourful and intricate. I have no patience for \"fancy\" food that's served up looking all beautiful, but doesn't taste special at all. Bosk is different. Sure, the plates are huge and the portions are small, but each bite packs a punch in terms of complexity. I never thought I'd hear myself talking about food like a foodie (I generally can't deal with food that has paragraph-long descriptions) here I am. Bosk has achieved the unthinkable. (Also, despite the small portions, I left very full... rich food!)

A particular standout to me was the dessert--and woe is me, but I cannot remember the name! It was a tarty buttermilk something (think pudding texture crossed with yogurt taste) with a scoop of apple-celery sorbet (sounds strange, but it was awesome). Great palate cleanser and very light; I am not generally a fan of heavy sweet desserts. The last great touch is the complimentary homemade passionfruit marshmallows that we received with the bill!

Special mention for the server, Trevor, who was attentive and pleasant.

Definitely not a daily-visit place, but highly recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious
Pros: Cozy atmosphere with sounds of live music coming in from main lobby. Food is delicious. Service is excellent. 
Cons: Pricey for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I have now been at Bosk for a couple of times and have always been very happy with my experience there. 

On my last visit, we went to celebrate my better half MBA graduation with his family. We had a very nice spacious table by the window and greeted promptly by our waiter. As our booking was late (9pm) we weren't too sure if they would let us have the tasting menu, but they granted our request with no problem. 

The tasting menu consisted of 7 dishes following the mood of the chef (please see pictures). We also took the Premium Wine pairing option. 

We were very happy with the quality of the culinary execution, as usual. The service was very attentive and spotless. 

As for the wines, we had an issue with 2 of them, as they had particles in them. The waiter apologized profusely and we were offered a glass of a wonderful 1985 Rose. 

It is definitely worth spending a bit to enjoy a meal at Bosk."}
{"text":"Given the price point I usually don't go to fancy places like Bosk. However, summerlicious gives me the perfect excuse to indulge in a fancy gourmet meal. I came here with three friends for lunch and together we managed to sample their whole Summerlicious menu. 
Staff are so extremely friendly and very service minded. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant until we left we had at least  three people checking in on us and making sure that we were satisfied. 
I'm sure everyone has heard that if you go to a fancy place you'll always end up leaving hungry. Well this was not the case for us. Food portions were a good size and despite some of the food being served without any carbs, the staff kept bringing us more and more bread. The bread was off course on the house and it tasted delicious with their flavoured butter!
All the main dishes were delicious but I would like to praise the pasta dish which I believe was the best dish served. 
I can't wait for winterlicious to come so I can come back to Bosk and indulge in fine cuisine at it's best."}
{"text":"We went there for the Winterlicious lunch menu.  I started with the pâte, which was tasty but not amazing.  The duck confit was dry and didn't have a lot of taste.  The chocolate hazelnut tart for dessert was really good.  I would go back just for the dessert, but not the rest of the food. Overall I was disappointed for the price.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my very delicious Halibut served with dungeness crab dumplings on a bed of corn here a couple nights ago. The restaurant is located within the Shangri La Hotel.
The atmosphere is stunning and the service is stellar.
The very nice waiter even gave me 2 pieces of confectionary on the house after my meal served in a little Chinese treasure box."}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend for breakfast. The coffee was delicious, French pressed. The chocolate croissant wasn't the best I've had...would not recommend the croissant. I got the eggs Benedict dish and that was absolutely worth it! All the ingredients were fresh and well seasoned."}
{"text":"I had four breakfasts at Bosk while staying at the Shangri-La Hotel in Toronto.  Food and service were very good.  Favorite breakfast was the cornflake crusted French toast."}
{"text":"This is a very up-scale restaurant located inside the Shangri-la, being inside already makes you feel classier. The waiter who served us was very polite, probably the best server-customer experience I've ever had! The food itself was delicious, although not too outstanding. What satisfied me the most was the dessert chocolate cake - mindblowing!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! 
Even though their kitchen was meant to close at 10:30, and the waitresses reminded us also, we got there at 10:15 and were not rushed at all.
A special shout out to waiter Matthew for being so helpful with recommendations

We ordered the three course ($75pp) but a la carte option is also available!
For starters:
The tomato soup with aged cheddar - YUM! 

Seconds:
Asparagus and Wild Mushroom (HAVE TO ORDER THIS!)
Lobster Gnocchi - i loved it. i'm not a huge lobster fan, but the small gnocchi and foamy butter on top really sealed the deal

Main course:
The average: Lamb - the sides that came with the lamb were unbelievable. I've never had sweet bread before (did you guys know it's part of a lamb's throat??) wow!! The lamb itself was succulent, but i have yet to have a great piece of lamb in toronto so it wasn't my favourite

The wow - ribeye!! Super juicy and melt in your mouth! Loved it!

Thank you Bosk for such a great evening! Will definitely be coming back, especially to try their brunch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for a brunch. Amazing decor, probably one of the best in Toronto. Good service, they have a good range of drinks available. But the food was just good, not great. So 4 stars:)"}
{"text":"Took my parents here to lunch for their winterlicious menu. Bosk had a cozy atmosphere and I couldn't ask for better service. We all got the chowder to start, it was good but my god was it salty! The pork and pasta dishes we ordered were overly salted as well. The only dish that wasn't drenched in salt was the poached pickerel. Thankfully, the desserts saved the day. Definitely get the gingerbread for dessert, it was amazing! Overall, it was a pleasant experience and the winterlicious price didn't hurt the wallet, but I can't say I would come back for more."}
{"text":"Oh kayh, very pretty setting. Music played makes me wanna barf. Very much dislike clubhouse.

Anywho, ordered ruben sand a whichy, and fries of course, duh.

Super yummy, little too much fat on the meat for my preference.

Bread served before meal is a m a z i n g 

Will come back to try the tuna bowl, but dont think ill want the rubuen again...

Server was very sweet, Dominique, very kind,"}
{"text":"I came to Bosk during the summer (2013) for Summerlicious during the evening. I really enjoyed the experience. 

I went with my boyfriend and the moment you step in you notice the ambiance instantly. They servers and workers at the Shangri-La are very nice and provided great customer service. I really appreciated the servers giving us the break down of each of the dishes that we ordered. It definitely help us understand the dishes and helped me to distinguish each of the unique tastes within the dishes. 

Overall, I would definitely come back, but because it was for Summerlicious I wasn't able to see what the prices are typically. :)


-CL"}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 3 times for either lunch or dinner and each time it was great. The wine is amazing. The food is pretty good but fancy and small. The buns that come with the meal are very delicious. The burger was probably my favourite dish there from what I tried. The red wine I had was amazing."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie... I was a bit breath taken when I walked into the Shangri-La. It was absolutely beautiful. I loved the modernized layout of the place as it brings a welcoming and relaxing vibe. Making my way to Bosk, I was very excited!

Out of nowhere, the server brings these two huge water serving apparatuses that were so unique. I hope that they put them in the museum so when archaeologists or scientists 10,000 years from now study us, they will be impressed at how we serve water. I can't think of a better way to make a great first impression!

I had a difficult time deciding between the Lightly Smoked White B.C Salmon and the Roasted Prime Beef Tenderloin. I went with my gut instinct of being a carnivore and went for the heartier choice- Prime Beef Tenderloin. 

When the plate arrived, I expected nothing less in the presentation. The dish was very detailed and very well put together. The warm colours that were used complimented each other very well. The splashes of sauces are well placed and is quite refreshing. Now comes the most important part - the taste. 

The tenderloin was very well cooked. Very juicy, but lacked a bit of seasoning. A little more salt would have hit the spot. The pomme puree and the mushrooms were nothing less than perfection. To be honest, after trying this dish, I did have a sense of regret of not getting the Smoked BC Salmon. I found the food to be quite average to say the least. 

For dessert, I had gotten the Dulcey Panna Cotta. When I saw the menu, I had very little expectations. None of the choices were unique. When I took my first bite, I knew my gut feeling was right. It was average.  Very comparable to the desserts served at similar restaurants - definitely does not have the \"wow factor.\" I would recommend getting starters and skipping dessert. 

A place like Bosk, I expect nothing short of perfection. Rating the food by itself, I would give this place 3.5 stars. I understand that a part of the cost is to pay for this luxurious setting. Due to the breath taking atmosphere, the welcoming staff and the first impressions, I had brought the rating up to a 4. Unfortunately, this was not a memorable dining experience for me and I do not believe I will return."}
{"text":"Bosk wasn't what I expected. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but you know, it's a thing.

We made reservations for 7:30 on a Friday night, and we were basically the only ones in the restaurant. Well, because of our hidden nook seat we thought the entire place was empty but when we left it had filled up. Apparently we were too early to be there with the crowds. This was what I wasn't expecting - the group was really subdued and quiet, where I was expecting Bosk to be full of young and perhaps a bit rowdier people.

So, excellent service as you would expect from a restaurant in that price bracket, and beautiful decor - it really has a great ambiance. 

The food was excellent, though I felt portions were a bit small. I left thinking I could have eaten more - not that I necessarily want to be stuffed, but pleasantly full would have been nice. I enjoyed everything except for the desserts - they were just too weird for me.

I would definitely recommend Bosk for a romantic dinner, but not so much a pre-going out meal with a large group! 

On an event note, they have a beautiful private dining room that looks to seat about 18!"}
{"text":"Bosk is an upscale restaurant located in the Shangri-La Hotel serving modern Canadian cuisine with an Asian flair. I came here during Summerlicious with my friend it was wonderful! I find that on average restaurants that participate in Summerlicious tend to have mass produced mediocre food but that wasn't the case for Bosk! The asparagus salad with fingerling potato had a unique buttermilk tarragon dressing. As for the main course, I chose the seared albacore tuna which was filleted and seared beautifully and paired well with the romesco sauce. Dessert was light on the palate, buttermilk panna cotta with poached Niagara peaches and cherries. Overall, one of the better Summerlicious meals I've had in years. Would love to come back again and sample their regular menu."}

I came during summerlicious here in Toronto so the price of $23 dollars was incredible value.... And if you are here during summerlicious be sure to come by.  Restaurant is in ground floor so no amazing views... But lots of Windows and an open feel..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice server, even though there was some hiccups. Food was sub par, not quite as good as the price paid for it, except for the desert, however it was a bday event, so I didn't mind splurging on that occasion. Just the case of a famous name with nothing more to it."}
{"text":"Wow, dinner at Bosk was incredible!  From the moment you walk into the restaurant you can just tell it is going to be a good night.  To get started they had bread with caramelized butter.  At first thought, it seemed kinda weird but after putting it on the bread it was great.  From there I got the sweet corn soup.  When it first came out they had the cornels and egg in a large bowl, but no soup?  That is when they pour the sweet soup into the bowl.  It was by far the best soup I had in a long time!  It was sweet and savory.  For my main course,  I had the rib eye.  Superb!  It was mouth watering and had so much flavor to it, and cooked perfectly!  The mushrooms and potatoes on the side looked very nice but I was not a big fan of how they tasted.  For dessert I had a rich layer of chocolate with marshmallows and gram crackers, sorta like a smores.  It was heavenly rich and was a great finish to a fantastic evening.  If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely be going back.  I went with my girlfriend and had an excellent romantic night out."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! I had a low expectation since we went during summerlicious but every dish was spectacular, probably better than canoe. Beautifully plated dishes and amazing blend of flavors that melt in your mouth. Their roasted tomato soup was phenomenal, made me fall in love with tomato soup. Attentive service  and elegant decor. We'd love to be back for their regular menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here for Summerlicious and it was good. $25 for a pre-fixe lunch at Bosk is a great deal. I started with the chilled pea soup with crushed croutons, lemon zest and creme fraiche- it was tasty, healthy and refreshing. My entree was grilled chicken with panko crumbs served with roasted mushrooms with a balsamic sauce. Dessert was tapioca pudding with sorbet, mango... It was good but nothing to write home about. Summerlicious items are small but don't be fooled by portion because its filling! If you don't want to kill your bill don't order drinks. A total dent in my wallet... $8.00 for grapefruit juice is ludicrous. Service was a bit slow at times but our waiter was very kind and knowledgable about what ingredients was used in each dish. Would come back."}
{"text":"I went for Summerlicious, and it was such a boring experience. The food tasted like nothing, and I found that I was leaving half of my food unfinished for each course (and I love good food). The service was fine, a little flirtatious for my taste, but I was with three women. They split a few little things on the table, but everyone is human right?

The tomato salad was just chopped tomatoes with bread from our table and a dollop of cream. The pasta just tasted like cream- it needed some punch, acidity. My un-discerning friend ate my main after I ate the vegetables around it. It was so bland, it was like sawdust in my mouth. The dessert was chocolate, which had a nice crunch in the middle, but it was so rich that one bite was enough.

That being said, this was Summerlicious. The quality just wasn't there, and for a $45 dollar three course meal, you get what you pay for. This restaurant has great reviews for it's regular fare, so I wish I had tried it in another capacity."}
{"text":"We showed up here to grab a bite for lunch. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that they only serve brunch on Saturdays, and that involves ordering an appetizer, main and a drink. No a la carte here, which of course means a very expensive brunch. The atmosphere was not as nice as I expected considering how nice the Shangri-La hotel is. The service was very professional although a bit cold and not really friendly. Everyone from the hostess to the waiter. 

On to the food. I ordered the chicken veloute which was pretty delicious I've got to say. It's a creamy soup kind of thing with chicken skin floating in it. It's much better than it sounds. I got the salmon for my main. It was good, but definitely nothing special. It was a pretty basic and lightly flavoured salmon dish. Overall, Bosk has some high prices but pretty average food and service.."}
{"text":"What to try?

Every season I get amazed by Chef Richard's dishes. I was lucky to try the calamari and it was delicious with the curry touch to the calamari and sprinkled with red pepper      I also like the drink list. This time I opted for a nonalcoholic drink and it was really delicious to sip on in this humid summer. It was called the elderflower fizz. Can be sweet for some ppl but for me it felt like I was drinking a very sweet nectar. I also was able to try his burger that the chef had that's being tested for the next menu. Grinded together was the short braised meat, sirloin and beef brisket which was the burgers patty and his way of making cheddar and housemade ketchup, topped with some housegrown pickles...it was sure a mouthful and got messy really fast. But it was a worthy burger worth every bite. 

I really liked spending time in the restaurant because there's a lot of spots within the restaurant that were instagram worthy shots and had backdrops that will even make the person in the picture look gorgeous. I especially enjoyed sitting at the bar where you can catch the sounds of the piano coming from the lobby. 

Last tip?

Go during the day around 3-5 pm and you can hear the piano play in the lobby as you enjoy a quick bite or drink at the bar. Take advantage of the summerlicious or winterlicious menu when the event is going on because their licious menus are just as good and at a price that's not as steep if you're worried about spending too much at bosk!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch. Dined from their winterlicious menu. I loved it! To the complementary bread to the chicken confit soup to the potato gnocchi and the chocolate tart dessert! Everything was delicious and the service was great. I would love to come back here."}

3 for the food but 4 for service. 

I came here for Summerlicious on a weekday for lunch. I started with the beef tenderloin, had the tuna, and the chocolate biscuit for dessert. Like the other reviews, the food presentation and quality of food was great. I wish however, the food tasted as good as it looked. 
The beef tenderloin is raw and comes with a mustard blueberry side. They were quite good together but not amazing. The tuna didn't really stand out to me. The chocolate biscuit cake alone was good but well paired with a passion sorbet. 
Service was great. They were friendly and attentive from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. Because I had a late lunch so I only had a salad (biased review alert)

Pros:
- Nice decor
- Cool water serving instrument / apparatus
- Very nice service 

Cons:
- Charged us $5 each for a cake we brought in 
- Charged us for water
- Mediocre Salad 
- Mediocre food presentation
- Generally feel one can do a lot better with the money you are spending at Bosk"}
{"text":"A good place for quality seafood. The items are simply prepared, and if you're a health nut, you'll love it. 

Service is what you'd expect for a restaurant in an high-end hotel like the Shangri-La -- it's flawless."}
