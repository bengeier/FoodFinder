{"text":"I went here with 7 other colleagues on a Thursday night. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful - very chic and rustic, something that is certainly rare in downtown Pittsburgh.

Courtney was our waitress - she was very bubbly and friendly and handled our large and demanding party easily.

We started with 4 appetizers - the mozzarella plate, fried zucchini, polenta & egg, and scallop au gratin. All 4 were amazing - I was especially impressed with the mozzarella plate, the buffalo was out of this world! My next favorite was the scallop au gratin, I believe it had bacon in it and the mushrooms were incredibly fresh. The fried zucchini comes with a delicious marinara that really enhanced the flavor. The polenta and egg, from what I gather, was also amazing. I am not one for polenta personally so I did not eat this.

I ordered the Papardelle with truffle oil which was out of this world. So simple, served with mushrooms, but oh so delicious. Based on Courtney's recommendation, most of our table ordered the crab cakes for their meal. What a great decision! The meat in this is overflowing and so wonderful. Another colleague got the veal osso buco and was in heaven. He cleaned his plate! The risotto was cooked perfectly in this dish.

Overall, this is a gem of a restaurant. It is perfect for a date or with work colleagues. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered 4 bottles of wine and the staff was very accommodating constantly giving us new glasses, etc."}
{"text":"I was here because  a friend of mine recommended it. In was extremely impressed with the ambiance as the whole restaurant was beautiful. The bar area also looked really cool even though we didn't partake that evening. Our server was prompt, pleasant and knowledgable. My two friends and my entree were all amazing. I had the gnocchi. Our bottle of wine was also good and we all left pleased."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and would say that we had mixed feelings about this restaurant. It is definitely a great space which is decorated beautifully. Our waiter was a bit curt, and I have to say that I agree with the other reviews on here, that he was definitely trying to get us to spend more money than we wanted to. The way that he described the salads that they offered was also confusing. We thought we would be receiving  a house salad with our meal when we decided not to go with the pricey parma or caesar salads that were being pushed upon us. Though we never received a salad and when we informed him that we were disappointed, and found his earlier explanation to be a bit confusing and misleading, he acted as if our assumptions were unfounded. I order some coffee before dinner, since the delicious aroma from it was wafting through the restaurant. A french press was brought to the table and poured for me, but my cup was filled with coffee grounds. When we told the waiter, he seemed annoyed and said that he would bring another, but because of the french press, it would probably happen again. The second cup only had a couple floating around, which was reasonable, and the coffee was bold and delicious. We ordered the arancini for an appetizer, and it was quite good, though we would have preferred it to be hot instead of just luke warm. After hearing from a couple of people, including one of our dinner companions, that the lobster raviolis were delicious, we decided to try them for dinner.  While they were good, we didn't feel that they lived up to their expectations. The brown butter sauce they came in was unfortunately a bit watered down. We told our waiter and he again seemed annoyed, though when we left the restaurant, we did tell the manager, and he seemed genuinely concerned. We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was out of this world! One of the best desserts that I have had in a long while. It was warm and moist and the caramel sauce is heavenly. I would go back to this restaurant just for this dessert! I think we will try this restaurant again in the future, and if it disappoints again, then at least we will know that we will have a phenomenal dessert to end the meal with!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is clean and elegant, but the food and wine was a bit high priced for what you order. My glass of pinot noir wine was excellent, but my spinach ricotta pizza was small and bland, which also gave me some acid reflux. The service was friendly, especially with our large group."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel made this recommendation.
The homemade buffalo mozzarella was magnificent.
Our waitress beamed over the crab cakes and she did not steer us wrong.
The chestnut gnocchi was heaven.
It was pricey - even to this New Yorker, but a lovely special occasion place."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Vallozzi's.  The atmosphere was wonderful, our server was EXCELLENT and our appetizers and entrees were absolutely delicious.  Regrettably, we decided on coffee and dessert.  The French press coffee was bitter and the desserts were average at best (tiramisu was sitting in a vat of syrupy kahlua and the cake part was dry)--which put a damper on our otherwise scrumptious evening.  I would still highly recommend Vallozzis, as it's easily one of the best restaurants in the burg--just skip the dessert!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken parm and it was very dry.  I had a hard time cutting it even with the giant steak knife they gave me."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently stopped in for lunch. Our food - chicken parmesan and fettuccine primavera - was delicious. Homemade pasta with flavorful sauces. The spaghetti was slightly undercooked, but otherwise the food was great! Our main concern regarded the wait staff. The hostess was friendly and seated us promptly. However, it looked like there was some conflict with the wait staff over whose section we were in. The male waiter who finally came by seemed less than happy to take our order. Service was very slow and waters were not refilled often (more of a problem in this summer heat!), even though it was late in the lunch rush and the restaurant was not that busy at this point. Asked for dessert menus but it took so long for him to come back after dropping off the menus off that we decided to skip it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and menu. Pricey... but a great choice if you are looking for something different.  Definitely check out the charcuterie by the bar. I ate at least my own weight in prosciutto and buffala mozzarella."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful place with terrific service. Beautiful set up and atmosphere is great. The bad? The food is horrible and overpriced for bad food too. Im not italian and i can cook better italian food. We had the veal parm and it was just way to salty. The calamari was overdone and did not have any flavour. We also had brussel sprouts and probably the better dish out of all. Pasta was overdone and nasty. Would not recommended this."}
{"text":"In town to visit with family (Unlike one star Liliana R who was going to the Opera with Mommy, see other reviews for explanation) and have always enjoyed Vallozzi's in Greensburg so we thought we would give the new one a try. And we were far from disappointed. 

Started with the fresh mozzarella bar that was a meal in itself. Highest quality of meats and cheeses made the appetizer a great  beginning to a great meal. I followed it up with large portion of Veal Osso Bucco with creamy risotto. The creamy flavor from the risotto with the gravy from the veal was unbelievable. They gave me a steak knife with the meal for what reason I don't know because the meat just feel off the bone and melted in your mouth. My wife had two large crab cakes. Coming from around the Baltimore area my wife has had some great crab cakes. She was surprised when she had these cakes because the amount of crab and the taste was beyond her expectation. 

All in all the meal was one of the best I have had in a long time. The meal was well worth the price. I hope that Liliana R. and Mommy enjoyed the Opera because they missed out on a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Big surprise on a reawakening block of Fifth Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh.  Little would one expect that, coming in off the street for a Friday night dinner, one might find oneself in a modernized Tuscan villa, with stacked stone outer walls and exposed wooden beam ceilings.  The stagecraft is so lavishly conceived that my initial impression was one of concern - did they really want to use all this real estate, here in downtown Pittsburgh, to put on this great show?

But the set design was only the first big surprise.  We had been to Vallozzi's in Greensburg, and while it was an enjoyable experience, I hadn't remembered much about the menu.  Right off the bat, though, this menu started to speak to me.  After my recent experience with the burrata cheese-grenade at Portobello in Notting Hill, I was pleased to see a menu of cheese starters that included the burrata!  Since my dinner companions were all about moderation this evening, however, we instead went with a parmigiano reggiano appetizer, dressed with artichoke hearts and lemon chips.  The blend of these disparate tastes was astonshing, and a great overture to the blend of taste notes I was to experience during the rest of the evening.

I had the beet salad next, which was comprised of an eclectic blend of greens, beets, berries, citrus, olives, nuts - one of the best, most unique and unexpected pre-dinner salads I've had in some time.  My companions had the parma salad, and there were many appreciative oohs and ahhs all around.

Surprising to say, but my entree, after those two great courses, was the least astonishingly brilliant moment of the evening, but very enjoyable - a swordfish braciole, with a wild mushroom, pancetta, ricotta stuffing, in a tomato sauce with spinach, olives and leeks.  The sauce was heavier than advertised, and threatened to overpower the other tastes, but apart from that the entree was just as imaginative as what had come before.  My wife and her friend each had the fish of the day, the hogfish, baked whole, and her friend's boyfriend had the seafood risotto, none of which disappointed.  We topped off the evening with coffee and desserts - the boyfriend and I shared the \"coffee and doughnuts,\" beignets with a chocolate-coffee-cream dipping sauce.

The wine list was impressive, and could also be seen as part of the Tuscan set design: I sat with my back to a bookcase of lovely Italian wines, and while we didn't order it, that Barolo behind me looked awfully tempting.  Instead we had a nice California Chardonnay with our fish.  The service was gracious and helpful, dealing with a number of substitutions and special instructions in exemplary fashion.  All in all, as great a dining experience as one could expect in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Until lunch today, I would have given Vallozzi's Piitsburgh five stars, but something has gone wrong since our last few meals there.  The restaurant was nearly empty today at the lunch rush, which may have been our first tip-off, but in terms of what was bad about our lunch today, here goes:
1.  The appetizer menu featured pickled rhubarb with the \"cheese tasting,\" so we ordered it.  Instead of rhubarb, horribly over-salted pickled vegetables were served with the cheese.  When we asked the waitress for pickled rhubarb, she flatly told us that they didn't have it.  Also, it came with no crackers, bread sticks or otherwise.  
2.  The calamari was fried hard beyond recognition. ...When I say \"fried hard,\" I mean that when we tried to use a fork, it shattered into burnt little pieces.  Also, the calamari and marinara sauce were brought with no serving spoons.  .....So much for sharing.  
3.  I asked for bleu cheese dressing on the side for my steak salad, but when the waitress brought it, she bluntly informed me that \"(they) didn't have any.\"   
In all fairness, every meal we've had until today has been good, but I fear something has changed there.  
Finally, I went on line to e-mail the restaurant directly before \"going public,\" but the have no contact form or e-mail address on their web site.
I really hope that today was an aberration, but based upon the lack of patrons, I'm afraid it wasn't.
T"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and more importantly so tasty. Meats and cheeses from the charcuterie is the best way to start. From there you can't go wrong, I have been back several times and tried something different each time, always high quality and delicious. The chefs specials are always unique and amazing if you can't decide from the menu. Homemade raviolis yummmmm.."}
{"text":"It doesn't have hilltop castle walls or piazzas out its front door, but stepping into this old world Itslian experience transports you to Assisi without the jet lag. Our favorite has us sitting around the marble mozzarella bar, ordering several appetizers, and watching Wes make his magic  assembling the Parma plate of different Italian cured hams, or the Burrata tasting, or varied types of mozzarellas. Homemade breads with a flavored ricotta and a little extra virgin olive oil, and our favorite Barolo makes for the perfect pre-show respite. If only Bocelli was in town. The entrees are authentic and the staff is professional, especially Melissa, the Bar manager. Great Escape in downtown Pittsburgh, or should we say, our Assisi. Ciao."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner with my husband. I was impressed. I know Italian food very well and this was good Italian food. I was impressed with the sauce. Get the 'sauce and meatballs' side dish. It's really good. I've never been in a restaurant that had good red sauce that tastes homemade so I usually end up ordering a vodka cream sauce. Vodka sauces are hard to really mess up. I'm a sauce snob. Well, this place had a good red sauce. I got the ravioli for my entree which had a marinara sauce on it so can't really judge from that, Italians will know what I mean. But the sauce on my husband's spaghetti bolognese and the sauce and meatballs side dish was fantastic. Enough about sauce. Well done. 

Usually in an Italian restaurant since I don't order dishes with red sauce the place gets judged by me by the quality of their meatball.  Vallozzi's gets a B+ for their meatballs. 

We were too full to order dessert -but they were tempting!  Oh and bonus our waitress was soooo super nice and friendly. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"What a gem! We had amazing service in this gorgeous and elegant restaurant. We had a bottle of wine and a cheese platter to start. The cheese was excellent and our server was knowledgable about everything on the menu.

I ordered the Funghi pizza for my meal. It was very rich, but good and not too large. My boyfriend had an amazing pasta dish with suckling pig. We finished with coffee.

As a huge bonus, it was never very loud inside, even though the restaurant became fully booked while we were there. They have carpeted floors (chic and modern) in the main dining room, which I think helped absorb the sound.

I highly, highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Although the pasta was fresh and tasty the service was slow..maybe they were making the pasta and stuffing raviolis after I ordered. I guess I should've read the reviews first. I really enjoyed my meal, the porchini mushrooms with braised ribs and kayle was very nice, the wine was okay and I could see it was not the waiters fault. Many tables around me seem to have the same slow service. Seems to me the kitchen is what makes things slow. All in all I give the food a thumbs-up but the service and price a big thumbs down. I'm sure there are many other nice places in Pitt you can spend that type of money for a meal."}
{"text":"Lovely decor. For the price, the quality of the food wasn't as expected. Not many options for meat eaters. Plenty of options of seafood and pasta. Special was incorrectly described... Waiter indicated sea scallops but served bay scallops. When asked he flippantly responded it was the chefs fault.  Overall food was not anything special."}
{"text":"Started out and ended well but the main courses were very disappointing.  I had the suckling pig papardelle, the noodles tasted like they had a very greasy chicken stock poured over them and the suckling pig was a small amount of pulled pork.   We also had the seafood risotto...very bland and the seafood and risotto were overcooked and dry.  With that said, I would go back for the meat and cheese again, as well as the bread pudding...but never again for dinner.  I had heard from friends that the dinner wasn't impressive but wanted to make my own judgements...sorry I didn't listen to them."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Fabulous food and pleasant service. The flank steak menu special was exquisitely balanced and perfectly prepared. Definitely five stars! We enjoyed the personality of the valet."}
{"text":"Is probably give them a solid 3.5 stars. Excellent service, reasonably priced drinks, and OK food. We had a late night reservation for a family dinner and they were still fairly busy.

My wide and I decided to start with entrecôte, which is basically little pieces of sirloin that you cook table-side on a pink sea salt slab. Came with some toasted bread, 3 fantastic spreads, and some seasoned arugula.

We also split a caprese salad and their soup special which was essentially French onion. I enjoyed both but my biggest complaint about the Caprese was that it must have been prepared in advance because it was VERY cold, which made it hard to enjoy the flavors.

For dinner I had a chicken dish that was stuffed with prosciutto, cheese and basil. While the fresh squeezed tomatoes were nice, I didn't love the dish. The chicken was rough and didn't have much flavor. Portion size was good though.

Highlight of the meal: the bread pudding. Some of the best I've ever tried. Wish it would've had some raisins but aside from that, perfect.

We were seated in the middle of one of the back rooms where they have a large bussing station right next to the table. This was a little odd to me and lead to some instances or loud noise right behind me.

Our waiter was pleasant and I enjoyed both beverages I had. Would certainly we back again to try a different entree and maybe their Happy Hour. With tip, our meal cost about $70 per person, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Tiny portions of good food not worth the price they charge.

While the restaurant is indeed appointed nicely, I ordered take out for lunch today and I can't help but feel completely ripped off and still hungry.

No included bread, salad, or otherwise with a $20 lunch entree? And no silverware, no napkins --- at least McDonald's gives you that much. How about a side dish? Potatoes? Steak fries? SOMETHING?

I had the Veal Milanese served with arugula. Yes, it was good.  If there was twice as much veal, they would have scored higher --- but there wasn't.

While the score should be closer to 1.5, I'm rounding down because I now have to go find a vending machine in a couple minutes.

They should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day, 7 people with 2 children.  The meal was not as good as some dinners we had there.  Service was way off.  The kitchen was extremely slow.  There were enough staff around, relative to guests.  We were the second table seated at 11 AM.    Looks like the restaurant was disorganized.  Dining with children is obviously a different experience, and we asked the waiter to serve the kids meal first.  The kids meal came after the adult meal... which took at least 30 minutes for the first course.   Waiter was indifferent to our request and needs.  Overall the food was good, but the service was lukewarm.   Worst part of the experience was the waiter's attitude."}
{"text":"I feel badly about the two star review. Really, I do. I wanted to like this place. Really. 

We were seated at 710 PM. It wasn't until 730 that we were even greeted by our server. I don't blame this on her- but rather on the overall disorganization of the place. 

The drinks took forever, the first time and each subsequent order. Our appetizer was delicious- buffalo mozzarella with two Italian meats. 5 stars!  

Our entrees were, overall, pretty good. I had the fried chicken with gnocchi. 

The others I dined with enjoyed their meals as well. 

My major disappointment was the menu- only five pasta options at an Italian restaurant.  

My advice: leave the steak to Capital Grille and make great pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and wonder each time was ... my meal a fluke?  I have ordered the house salad, wedding soup,  asparagus, and crabcakes each time .... why? 

Because it is one of the best meals that I have ever eaten in my life. 

The crab cakes (2) are held together by ... more crabmeat and are between the size of a baseball and softball ... so come hungry.    

The wait staff are attentive and review your reservation ... your show is at 7:30 ... I'll make sure you have time to enjoy your meal and walk to the theater. 

Soft music ... slower pace ... everything is just done well ... 

Highly recommend for a romantic dinner or to impress business colleagues ..."}
{"text":"We went last night for my parents 40th wedding anniversary.  It was a great dinner. 

Our waiter(Greg) was excellent.  

Started with:

Polenta - Fabulous. 
Taste of Mozzarella - Not great to share with 5 people, better for 3. 
Arancini - Excellent

I had the Ravioli with Ricotta, basic but very good. 
Risotto Seafood was excellent.  Scallops were cooked perfectly.  

Great meal, I will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. The Italian hoagie was better! The wing dings were tasty. All in all it was good pizza delivery."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots for happy hour downtown. Great drink and app specials. All of their apps, including the fresh mozzarella bar and oysters, are great. Beef entrecote is tasty and fun, but for the price I'm not sure that it is worth ordering more than once. I was a little less impressed with the dinner entrees that I've had (bucatini carbonara and suckling pig pappardelle) but they were still pretty good. Very good service, too."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Vallozzi's a couple hours before a show. We did not have a reservation, so we sat in the \"lounge\". This area serves the same food as the restaurant, but is seat yourself. My friend and I sat about 15 minutes before anyone came over to help us. We got our drinks and the waitress brought over a bread plate with assorted breads and whipped ricotta topped with olive oil (very delicious). I ordered the stuffed rigatoni with vodka sauce which was amazing. My friend ordered the gnocchi with marinara and the sauce was really great. Overall, i would recommend, however I would definitely make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great prices, my favorite italian restaurant in downtown pitt!"}
{"text":"I will never patronize this restaurant ever again!  My friends and I have been treated rudely by the vallet staff.  When I complained to the on duty Manager his smug response was so arrogantly delivered, basically a \"too bad so sad...not our emplyees\" that it was the first time in a very long time I actually was going to use profanity towards someone!!!  I have filed a complaint with Mayors Office.

I will eat Sheetz hot dogs off of the sidewalk, in my underwear, before I ever set foot in that restaurant again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I first dined at Vallozzi's on New Years Eve' 13 and have been monthly regulars since that first dinner.  Saturday, March 9th we dined with a party of 6.  The food was great but the service was slow and lacking. I have had good and not so good waiters at Vallozzi's.
Our fried calamari and zucchini appetizers were good and the salads were tasty, as I am exceptionally fond of the fresh mozzarella bar.  It is a great concept for something different.  For the table's bread service, I enjoyed the creamy ricotta butter.  For dinner, the Filet Mignon is excellent but the table's side dishes of mashed potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts never arrived.  First, the waitress said they would be 1 minute, then 5 minutes later she said the sides \"died\" in the warmer so the chef was making new.  Well, we finished dinner and never saw our side dishes, so that was disappointing.  To make up for the sides, the manger took our 2 lava cakes off the bill, but next time I would prefer my side dishes over free dessert."}
{"text":"Stay away, made reservations, but seating was changed when we arrived. A party of 6 and all had poor meals. Sent a letter to management and never heard back."}
{"text":"Why haven't I tried Valozzi's sooner? Stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday and it was relatively empty.  It did slowly pick up, but not to the point where you couldn't walk in and get a table without a reservation. Once walking in, I couldn't help but notice how nice it was inside. Stone walls and warm colors. As one could guess from the looks of the outside, Valozzi's is a little fancy. 

I don't quite remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was a kind of a sampling of four different dishes for around $14. It came with their crab and corn chowder soup, caprese salad, gnocchi, and beef tenderloin. These selections change daily I believe. Though each sampling was small, together they made a great meal. The flavors were quite delicious and such variety of flavors meant my lunch would not be boring. 

I'm a fan of a dish that offers a sampling of the menu. I will definitely return for lunch and most likely order the same thing!"}
{"text":"Great location in the business district. The atmosphere is welcoming and luxurious. Prices trend higher than alternatives for lunch in the area. Salads and appetizers are well portioned. Flavors in the pasta dishes play well together. High quality ingredients in every dish. Service wasn't the most friendly and the speed of services was slow. An overall good experience - but leave yourself enough time for the full meal."}
{"text":"Food was great (but a little pricy). Service was outstanding as well. 10/10 would recommend this establishment for a great date night!"}
{"text":"Not a good first impression starting from the greeter, she could of said \" hello\" instead of just looking at us with a stare. We got seated in the middle of the restaurant , our server came over gave us water and that was it, she came back 10 minutes later to go over the specials of the evening and never once asked if we had any questions regarding the menu. We did have questions to ask!!! she came back again and when we started to ask her about the menu she interrupted us as if we weren't important . We eventually got up from our table and left . Think twice before you attempt to dine at this establishment."}
{"text":"Vallozzi's has been one of my parent's favorite places in Pittsburgh for awhile now! Being Italian, my dad is picky about his Italian meals (If it isn't homemade.. he's not interested). But, Vallozzi's has passed his test and he continues to rave about it! I'm sure the fresh mozzarella bar, delicious martini's, and amazing ambiance also have something to do with it too! 

I visited Vallozzi's for lunch with my parents a few Summers ago and we ate in the bar area. I remember loving my meal and the whole experience! More recently, I was invited to a friend's birthday dinner here and was excited to come back! Because it was a larger group, we were seated in the dining area and had a semi-private room to ourselves with a large table. The dining table we were at was simply stunning- it was dark and romantic! We were greeted right away by our waitress asking what we were drinking. It was a long week- so I stuck with wine. She suggested a sauvignon blanc that was great. She also brought out homemade bread & dipping oil that was fabulous!

For my meal, I ordered the shrimp diavolo. This was amazing! It had a spicy rose sauce over top of linguine and shrimp. It was the perfect amount of spice for a pasta sauce. I could tell that everything was fresh and made in house which made me love it even more! Others around the table had gnocchi, ravioli, mussels, fried calamari, shishito peppers, and salads. Everybody else loved what they ordered as well! If you love Italian food, spectacular service, and a great atmosphere- check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Had a snack of a cheese platter and meat platter which was fantastic.  In addition, the Motto Cabernet was very good with a touch of berries and chocolate.  I would like to go back for a full dinner..."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the spinach and onion pizza.  The crust is some sort of croissant-like perfection."}
{"text":"I have dined at Vallozzis several times in the past few years as resident of Pittsburgh. I have enjoyed meals on the sidewalk with girlfriends, several group birthday dinners, intimate lunches and even solo drinks at the bar. I am so disappointed by my experience last night and encourage this restaurant to revisit their training protocols. 

When I arrived at around 6:30pm, the restaurant was not busy at all. I walked towards the bar to wait for a friend and on my way, one member of a group of people in that area walked right into me, nearly knocking me off my feet and barely excusing herself. As I sat down at the bar, I watched her barrel towards a waitress to sort out the bill. When she returned, her party loudly debated the bill for several minutes. During all this time, neither of the two bartenders who were not busy as I was the only one seated at the time, greeted me or provided a menu. After at least 10 minutes, one bartender plopped down a menu without salutation. Moments later, 2 men who looked like they had just left a construction site sat one seat away from me. The bartender hurriedly greeted them with \"good evening,\" exchanged pleasantries and took their drink orders. I still had not been served. Based on the service and the noise from the group, I decided to request a table in the restaurant from the host.

Upon my request, the host sat me at a booth near the back of the restaurant. I was awaiting one more guest and this was a good location. However, the waitress did not seem to be pleased or interested in serving me. She came to the table and stated, \"Oh, you're waiting for one more.\" She filled my water glass but did not take my drink order. I asked for a glass of wine. Her disposition was unpleasant and she seemed annoyed. However, I watched as she pleasantly greeted and served patrons at two other tables that arrived after me. When my fiancé arrived moments later, she filled his water glass but again failed to take a drink order, offer a greeting, discuss specials etc. Again, she moved to the other table across the aisle and engaged in these actions, as to be expected of a waitress in an upscale restaurant. 

I went to the restroom and returned and still, no drink order had been taken for my fiancé. Several minutes later, the waitress returned but again seemed distracted and nonplussed. She took the drink order and returned shortly with his beverage and bread. We had placed our menus on the table to signify that we were ready to order but we were not asked about our decision or informed about specials. And yet again, I watched this waitress walk across the room to another table and take out her notepad to document some part of their food orders. 

At that point, I realized that we needed to make another decision about our dining experience. We paid for our beverages and then I briefly spoke with the manager. After describing what had taken place, I fully expected him to make an attempt to rectify this situation. Instead, he repeated several \"I'm sorry's\" but seemed most concerned with getting us to leave. Unbelievable!

I am not sure if Vallozi's is focusing on large group parties to generate the most revenue or if they no longer welcome African American patrons. Whatever the case, as a former customer and diner at many restaurants in the Downtown Pittsburgh area, I maintain that Vallozzi's offers the worst dining experience and is unapologetic about their failures in customer service. Never again and tell a friend!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Lovely entrees! Great creme brûlée burnt orange- will be going back"}
{"text":"I want to love Vallozzi's.  I want to love it so much that I took my mumsie to Valozzi's for the most important day of the year - Mother's Day.  I couldn't BELIEVE the price - $25 for a 2-course brunch + drink at a swanky joint like that?! Sign.me.up.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for.  Between the two of us we sampled a variety of dishes from the attractive menu, and added a basket of biscuits to complement the meal. The apps and entrees were unremarkable and the biscuits were just plain overdone. I will say that the service was lovely and the atmosphere delightful.  The bloody mary bar was incredible and almost worth the price of admission itself.  

I'm hoping it was just an off day, because I do think that between the venue and the service, Vallozzi's has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Kentucky Derby Day for a little pasta and a cocktail.  I really liked the lay-out of the restaurant.  The vibe is definitely of a romantic (yes, I said romantic) but modern italian restaurant.  The lighting is dim enough, but not dark.  The music was not what you would expect (no italian love songs playing or smooth jazz but rather a modern set of pop music), but I have horrible taste in music anyway, so what do I really know.   They have a huge bar area with ample seats at the bar and tables around it.  They also have the mozzarella bar, which is the first I have ever seen.  

The bartender serving us was really good, friendly and knowledgable.  He made one of the better mint julep's I have ever had!  The other staff there were extremely friendly and they provided top notch service.  

The wine menu is pretty decent as well.  The focus is on italian wines, but they have offerings from France, Califronia, Germany...etc.  Dry wines, sparkling wines, sweet wines, you name it, they have it.  The prices on the wine were within reason, with some 'hidden' values on the menu. 

The food was excellent.  My favorite thing was the Arancini.  Good perfectly!!  We also had the Buffalo, creamy and smoked ricotta from the mozzarella bar.  Was quite good.  I really loved the Pappardelle Bolognese and the better half really enjoyed Gnocchi.  Everything was good perfectly and the prices were quite reasonable.  

Overall, I had an extremely good experience here and would easily go back again whether for cocktails or for dinner."}
{"text":"Food, service and wine are fantastic. My staple order is the Veal Parm along with a nice Chianti.  Candice on the bar is the best . To finish things off you need to try the Bread Pudding topped with their homemade ice cream...yum!"}
{"text":"Eat there New Years Eve.  The service was good, for the food not impressive
at all over priced for the quality.  I did have oysters they were good and my wife had the Rockefeller and enjoyed them. She had the Gnocchi and eat very little of it Gnocchi were muss and tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can. I had the Suckling Pig Papardelle unimpressive. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Meatball \"Panini\" was awful yesterday. It was a stale bun with hard meatballs. Steer clear of this dish if you go for lunch. No self respecting Italian restaurant would have served such a mess."}
{"text":"A great italian restaurant. I would not go here for pasta though because it tends to be  on the dry flavorless side. Stick to the steak and the chops. I was going to try the Osso bucco but not for $43.00 with no starter. I enjoyed my strip steak and truffle oil fries. The risotto balls were a great starter. Avoid the baked pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here before and enjoyed it, but today's unexpected lunch option blew me away.  

The decor is lovely and the ambiance very nice for a downtown swanky restaurant.  What's weird - in a very good way - is the music.  You would expect this place to have pretentious classic or jazz playing, but instead you are treated to some fantastic mix that sounds like something from WYEP.  Lovely surprise. 

When I walked in, I was given the drink menu which struck me as a bit odd for lunch.  While I am all for drunken afternoons, I feel that my company would have a bit of a problem with it - as would most companies within walking distance.  But I was also handed a strange 4 course menu.  This was awesome.  It was broken into 4 courses which are served on the same plate as a healthy and nutritious 4 course meal.  Tons of choices, but for today, I picked:
1. Arugula with goat cheese and brambleberries (read blackberries, raspberries and blueberries) - There was no dressing which at first struck me as odd, but as I stabbed through some arugula, berries and goat cheese all in one bite, I realized that it didn't need any.  Perfect combination. 
2. Braised escarole with beans and pancetta - A bit salty for the pancetta, but you expect that with this combination.  It was a bit mushier than I have had other places (which might be their \"thing\"... see below), but the flavor was pretty out of this world.
3. Scallops with peach salsa - Just awesome.  The salsa was both sweet and spicy and the scallops were seared perfectly. 
4. Polenta with fennel sausage and peppers - By far the most disappointing of the quadrants.  The polenta was too mushy for my tastes and there was not nearly enough sausage.

I will definitely be back to pick 4 more choices.  Oh and this was all for $14.  Maybe more than a regular lunch, but with these high end choices, well worth the money."}
{"text":"I have never been to Vallozzi's and had my first experience on Saturday. Needless to say, I will not be back. 

The atmosphere seemed promising: a warm, romantic feel with a lively crowd. Bar service was good with a decent selection to choose from. Dining area seems crammed. On multiple occasions we watched servers collide in the limited space.

Food was mediocre, at best, with the exception of dessert. Mozzarella bar appetizer was interesting and was a hit with our 6 person table, but I was extremely disappointed in my meal. I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Lobster Risotto (which sounded delicious). I was looking forward to a rich, creamy dish on a cold night! When I received my meal, I was disappointed to see that my \"risotto\" was more \"rice pilaf,\" with almost non-existent moisture. There were also diced red peppers mixed in which, due to possibly misreading the menu, I was unaware came with the dish and which I can not eat. So I spent half my meal picking around them.  Fried lobster was tasty, but the lobster that was mixed into the \"risotto\" was rubbery and overcooked. All in all, so not worth the $32! Dessert was FANTASTIC. The table shared a seasonal cannolli (pistachio) and an order of the bread pudding. Both were delicious.

Our server, however, was HORRENDOUS!!! He was inattentive, borderline rude at times and we seemed like an inconvenience to him. He would disappear for 15-30 minutes at a time and would look in a different direction if anyone from our table flagged him down. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table which he them plopped on the table (No drink that he served us was set nicely down. All were dropped from at least a 2 inch height!) and was left unopened until we flagged him down 20 minutes later, to which his comment was \"Oh, I thought you had a cork screw.\" When we placed our meal orders, I asked for a 2nd drink from the bar and did not receive said drink until our dessert was served. Another guest at my table was not served her dessert beverage until the check came. And then there was the check. When the check came, it was one single check for 6 people, even after we asked at the beginning of the meal to have the check split into two separate ones. When we questioned this, his rude response was \"Well, I can't do it now because I CAN'T remember what everyone had!\" So he was asked to put 2/3s of the bill on one card and the remainder on another card. He screwed this up too! Charging both cards the incorrect amount then disappearing before we could complain.

All in all it was one of the WORST dining experiences I have ever had. Not worth the price of the food to dine there and be treated that way. Serving staff need to be retrained on customer service, especially on busy weekend evenings. I will not be returning to Vallozzi's."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant.  Interesting and tasty dishes that are not the typical fare.  Good selection of drinks.  Good wine list, nice atmosphere and good service.  Easy walk to Heinz Hall."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Velozzi's was again a 4* experience, with good marks for food, service, atmosphere, and drinks. To get to the 5* level upgrades are needed in the menu, with a greater variety, the noise level, which is excessive, and the number of lower priced wines, which are extremely limited. However, it's fine as is, and ranks as one of our reliable Saturday dining options."}
{"text":"Much better than the Greensburg location!  Well to be fair, I haven't eaten there in many years but I really like this place.

Food choices on the lunch menu were unique combinations that tasted great.  I for example had salmon with squash and risotto.

Instead of normal bread and butter you get three kinds of bread and ricotta cheese drizzled with olive oil and herbs...a nice touch.

There was also a fresh mozzarella bar but did not have a chance to check that out since I was out to lunch with vendors the day I ate here."}
{"text":"A strong choice for special-occasion dining downtown. The can't-go-wrong menu is complemented by the professional service, contemporary décor and fixtures, and warm ambiance. I recommend the pappardelle bolonese. The kitchen was accommodating of my 12-YO's tastes as well. Casual attire before a game is fine, jacket is appropriate."}
{"text":"Headed to Vallozzis before a show last evening. The food was delicious, the flavor was present and the authenticity was evident. Wait staff was very accommodating and professional. The ambiance of the restaurant was above par and very inviting. The only reason that I am rating this restaurant four stars is for the price relative to food served. Be willing to spend a bit for generally smaller than average portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Try the papardelle bolognese...the sauce is fantastic.  My wife had the barzini with lemon capers...delish.  We also had the mussels starter which were cooked perfectly and came with toasted bread to sop up the wonderful sauce.  Server was fun and attentive.  Went back the next night and was packed...recommend reservations.  Also had the Toddy Italiano which is a great drink on a cold day...yum."}
{"text":"The decor is absolutely gorgeous - the space is huge and very well-decorated. It would be a great place to have an event or party....except for the food. 

The appetizers were good. I had a polenta with sausage, onions, and fried egg. It was a great combination, if mushy.  For dinner I had what was allegedly bucatini amatriciana.  I love Italian food, and I know that bucatini amatriciana should be made with, for starters, bucatini.  This was made with spaghetti.  If there was guanciale or pancetta in it, I couldn't find it.  Lesley's mafalda with vodka sauce tasted, as she put it, exactly like a Lean Cuisine.   I agree with another reviewer who said that this restaurant is *way* overpriced for the quality of the food I just described. 

As for the positives, the wine list is pretty extensive and there are a good number of reasonably priced options. The service was good, if overly attentive (which is better than underly, if that's a word, attentive).  

This is a new restaurant and I believe it takes time to iron out kinks, but t seems that much more attention has been put into how this place looks than how the food actually tastes."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for quite some time and finally stopped in for dinner. For starters, it's a really beautiful restaurant (definitely on the fancy side). Would I recommend it for dinner? Not so much. Lunch? I'd give it a try because they seem to have more to offer. 

Our waitress was really friendly, however with this being our first time dining here we needed some assistance with the menu. She wasn't to eager to ask if we had any questions about the menu. But another waiter did hear our conversation and came right over to explain some of the menu items to us which was a big help. We both went with the gnocchi for our entrees. It came with red sauce, sausage and broccoli rabe. It's not the biggest bowl of pasta, but it was just the right amount to leave me full and without leftovers. Was it the greatest gnocchi I have ever had? No. But it wasn't the worst and all pastas are made in house. The bread and ricotta/olive oil was a nice change up to the average olive oil. Keep in mind this restaurant is very pricey! Risotto is one of my favorite things, but I couldn't justify the price of $36. They had a Risotto on special with mushrooms and that was over $40. All in all, I feel it's a little over priced for just \"ok\" food."}
{"text":"My first restaurant review only because I feel I wasted my money, time and spoiled the dinner I planned with my mother before the Opera.  Nice looking restaurant,  nice wines-very overpriced. What did it for me was the service and the quality of the food. Don't order the asparagus with arugula salad because it is not a salad. According to the owner/manager it's a \"misprint in the menu\" - so change the recipe! Or inform the costumer. The lobster ravioli were under seasoned. The Creme brûlée with Grand Marnier had no Grand Marnier. We were never given the specials for the evening nor were we asked if we wanted desert. Is not as if they were packed and they wanted our table!  Overall the food was mediocre.  Service with a smile but pretty bad."}
{"text":"Let's just say if you have tickets to a show you better allow yourself a good 2.5 hours to eat and enjoy your meal because reservations at 6:15pm to be sure we made an 8 pm show was not enough time.  The night started out great.  We arrive ( 4 in our party) at 6:15pm and were immediately seated at a nice table in the back.  (Bonus) The atmosphere was very nice.  (Bonus) Our waiter Chris was nice enough (and I do not blame him for what happened).  He took our order after a respectable 5 or 10 minutes.  We informed him of our 8pm show time and he assured us that we will have plenty of time.  We ordered the turtle soup, some kind of risotto balls, salads, and our main dishes.  Around 7:15pm we asked what the status was on our appetizers as we had not yet received any.  Shortly after, our soups, salads, risotto balls all came out at the same time.  The turtle bisque was pretty good as was the caesar salad.  I thought it unusual that everything would come out together but whatever.  7:35pm we were waiting for our entrees and reminded Chris about our 8pm show.  7:40pm our entrees arrived.  We asked for the check immediately and scarfed down our entrees.  Which were just ok.  The Bird asked to see the Manager about the delay and stated that if 6:15pm was not enough time for us to have dinner there and catch an 8pm show they should have just told us when we made the reservations.  He only said that they do not make excuses and that the bottle of wine was on the house. (A nice gesture I give them that).  No one in our party had time to finish their entrees and were all \"bloated\" from wolfing it down.  Plus we never did receive our check.  The manager eventually brought it over and of course it was not divided as we requested when our orders were taken so hence more delay.  

Funny thing is, I did read theses reviews (the majority being negative ) and my buddy was even advised not to try Vallozzi's by a friend who happens to own a restaurant in the south hills but I had to try it myself.  I think we all learned the hard way tonight.  As far as the food goes, like I said nothing special and in fact I am still feeling a little ill some 4 hours later.  Vallozzi's, please if you need over 2 hours to prepare a meal that is quite alright, but don't tell your customers differently.  (We ran into another couple at the show who were also late due to their dining at Vallozzi's ).  Such a nice place but we will never go there again.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Vallozzis is the underdog of the Pittsburgh bar scene. You rarely see it get mentioned in the 'best bars' lists, but it definitely earns its place among those other spots.

Wine list = excellent. Even better if you're going by the bottle, but the by-the-glass selections are terrific as well. (They get a great selection of Californian wines, including PEACHY CANYON!!! Paso Robles wine in PA!!) If wine's not your thing, they have an awesome cocktail menu with classics and originals, and specials on some of those as well.

Added bonus - the bartenders are just fabulous. Knowledgeable, quick, and friendly as can be.

As for the food: you really can't go wrong with a place that has a mozzarella bar. A mozzarella bar! Their entire charcuterie selection is delicious, and they serve their bread with a fluffy herb butter.

This is one of the restaurants in Pittsburgh that does octopus and does it well - perfectly grilled and tender.

But the star of the menu is the arancini. Whatever else you order, make room in you belly for that. TO DIE FOR. Crispy fried outside, creamy cheesy inside. I could eat three servings, and a single serving is a sizeable portion.

The bar area can certainly fill up, especially on a night when there's excitement downtown. So yes, sometimes you will walk past Vallozzis and be turned off by the sheer force of the crowd inside. But be strong and wait it out - you will not be disappointed with food, drink, or service. And that's why this underdog will always have a place in my bar-going heart."}
{"text":"I've been here for drinks a few times, so I was excited to find out my department was having our holiday office party here. We had the lounge/bar area closed for our group to socialize while accompanied with great service and delicious food.

The staff was wonderful and extremely attentive. A huge shout-out to Candace, Julia, Mike and Tabi for taking such great care of us! Drink orders were taken and delivered quickly, tables were cleared promptly and the event as a whole went very smoothly. 

We had a great variety of food so there was a little something for everyone. Bacon-wrapped scallops, fried mozzarella, multiple types of pizza, olives, prosciutto sandwiches, sauteed vegetables, meatballs and last but CERTAINLY NOT LEAST was a creamy crab casserole that was my favorite of the night! I had to cut myself off after two servings of the crab because it was so rich! I heard many people raving about all of the food, but especially about the crab.

This was a great venue for our group and I look forward to going back soon. Unfortunately there was no risotto as part of our menu but I've heard theirs is amazing. At least I have another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"All in all, for me, the food wasn't worth the money.   It's a beautiful restaurant with a great bar area and beautiful dining room.   The lighting, the stone work, the paints, etc., all make for a beautiful and comfortable atmosphere.   The food is very good.  The service started out well but then fell off a bit as the restaurant got more crowded during the lunch hour.  

I really enjoyed that they served fresh ricotta with the bread rather than just butter or even oil.   For lunch, I opted for the angel hair pasta with shrimp, artichokes, tomatoes, basil and garlic in a white, wine lemon sauce minus the shrimp.  In any restaurant, I always wish when you opt for no meat or seafood on the dish, that they will adjust the price but alas they did not nor did they offer to substitute anything.   The pasta was tasty (maybe a little too much oil in the sauce) and the artichokes in there were delicious! The only thing is I just didn't think it was worth 15.95 for the lunch portion."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite Italian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. I'm a bit on the fence, but no matter which way you slice it, it's impressive. First and foremost the service is outstanding. The selections include some you may not be used to, but we're always willing to try something new. Personally I'm spoiled by places like Pasta Too in the south hills that give you tons of food at a great price. This is not that kind of place. Think more in terms of fine dining. The meal here is more of a total experience. Our check ran close to $100 for two people without drinks. 

The prices here are a bit higher than you expect for Italian cuisine, but the added quality and service make it an excellent choice for a special occasion. I'll add more detail after our next visit."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of the hotel concierge, not really expecting a whole lot. The Buffalo Caprese was an amazing start. The Pizza Roma was decent-- the crust is unexpectedly crunchy, but tasty. 
And if you don't save room for the bread pudding, you'll miss the best part.

Good stuff. Good service. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I wish I could move this restaurant back to Michigan.  I loved it.  Food, wine, service,  atmosphere - all terrific.   Not to mention conveniently close to our hotel.   We were in town for the Frozen Four hockey tournament.  This was the \"Yale\" bar for the tournament, but wasn't filled with Yale fans and we happened in relatively late on a Thursday night after the first day of games.   They had a special menu for the tournament, and we ordered a variation of a Caprese salad and a pizza from that menu - absolutely wonderful.  Thin crust pizza and we ordered it with sausage and the sausage was really, really nice.   Good wine selection  and a full bar as well - exactly what I wanted.  We were back two days later  for dinner and ordered pasta - so yummy.  No, it wasn't inexpensive, but considering the quality of the food and experience, it was fairly priced."}
{"text":"It isn't that the food wasn't tasty or the service wasn't good, I just expected more.

We went for dinner early on a Wednesday evening.  When we went to the hostess, we were given attitude that we didn't have a reservation.  It almost felt like the look she gave us was to shame us for thinking we could get into their establishment without a reservation.  They did have available seating in the lounge area, so we took a seat and were promptly greeted with a meal, drink and pizza menu.  I was underwhelmed with the options.  I felt like they were trying too hard to be trendy and \"Top Chef\" like in their entree choices.  The menu lacked basic Italian staples like spaghetti parm or simple pasta dishes. I ordered the cabonara and it was tasty (and the portion large) but it was not a true version of the dish.  My husband had the lasagna and rather than it being typical lasagna stuffed with either meat or cheese, it had a variety of fillings including butternut squash.  Everyone enjoyed the flavor of their entrees, but did feel that they were overpriced.  

I like the concept that aside from the dinner menu there is also a fresh mozzarella bar and a charcuterie, but overall, I think the experience is not worth the prices you pay."}
{"text":"Great restaurant right near market square. The entrecôte appetizer is unbelievable. It comes out with 6-8 pieces of thinly sliced and tender beef. You cook it on a hot salted Himalayan rock. It comes with dipping sauce and hard crunchy bread. It's worth the trip just to eat it. The gnocchi was very soft and the meat sauce was very tasty. The Caesar salad was incredible and comes out with a soft cooked egg on top. So yummy. The pasta carbonara was also very tasty. The prices were very reasonable. I would recommend trying it if you haven't. You can also valet your car in market square so you don't have to drive around looking for a spot in a garage."}
{"text":"Vallozzi's, while offering a pleasant environment and good wines falls short where it counts most, on their food. Out of 3 dishes ordered, only the carbonara was decent, not amazing, but passable. The other two dishes were not liked at all.  Two specialty martinis were far too sweet. The prosciutto tasting was good, but could have benefited from an accompaniment. The fried zucchini was tasty, but a little too heavily battered for our taste.  We dine out extensively and live in town, so we know the market. Vallozi's is charging too much for mediocre food. The very good Sienna a half block away offers much better food at much more reasonable prices. To justify the lofty prices Vallaozzi's is charging, the food needs to be taken up in quality quite a bit. It's a shame because the interior is lovely. I'll be at Dish or Sienna the next time I crave Italian food."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Vallozzis, and there was no disappointment.  The service, and food are fantastic!   We will definitely return.  
Thanks!"}
{"text":"We went there for Valentine's Day, the food was delicious. The wait seemed longer than usual for a crème brûlée. But overall the food was excellent"}
{"text":"After unexpectedly ending up Downtown on a Wednesday night and not being able to get a table at Butcher and the Rye, my husband and I decided to try Vallozzi's for dinner.  On a few previous occasions, I had appetizers and wine in the bar area during happy hour with friends.  The bar service was always good, the wine delicious, and the apps tasty, but I had never actually eaten in the dining area.

After my dining experience last night, I think I'll only be returning for drinks in the future. Let me first say that the service was probably the best part of the meal.  Our waiter was polite, amiable, and very attentive.  I didn't have to flag him down once, although he was taking care of several tables around us.  

The food, on the other hand, was a different story.  Dinner started out well, as I ordered the shishito peppers and was in heaven.  They were perfectly cooked and appropriately salted/oiled.  For my meal I had butternut squash soup, which was so sweet that I couldn't finish the small bowl.  I also shared brussels sprouts with my husband and was pretty disappointed by the amount of oil and butter in the dish. (I didn't even realize that sprouts could taste unhealthy until I had these!) My husband had the pork chop (which was fried) and he was generally happy with his selection.

Overall, our experience was okay, but I certainly won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had made a 5:15 PM reservation and they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, which I said was a birthday. When seated the dining room was totally empty. There are dreary murals on opposing walls which look like Tuscany after a nuclear attack!  Our waiter was adequate but not overly attentive. A small amount of bread and \"white butter\" (ricotta) was served and was tastless and lack luster. We ordered the short rib (dinner special $28) and the veal parm $32. The rib included a sweet potato fennel which looked like a smear on the plate. The rib was bland and tastless. We had to ask for salt and pepper as none is on the tables, to at least make it somewhat palatable! The veal was room temperature and the breading was soggy. The small amount of pasta in the center was the only thing hot, and was tough and gummy. The $72check without alcohol (which they heavily push) was ludicrous! A heartier and more consistent meal would have been had at the Olive Garden which I detest!
Oh, and by the way....The birthday was NEVER mentioned! We wanted to pay the check and get out of there! NEVER TO RETURN!!!"}
{"text":"I had invited colleagues of mine to dine at Vallozzi's. The food was just ok and probably on the expensive side regarding its taste. The service was extremely slow.. 

What actually makes me write this review is neither of the previous facts.. What happened is that my wife forgot her hat at the table when we left. After a couple of days we called them and after calling back and forth they told us that they found the hat. When we went to the restaurant to pick the hat, the manager said that the hat was not there. I asked him what happened and why they told us to come and pick it up. His response was that the hat was there a couple of days before and they had kept it for us but all of a sudden they lost it! The most annoying thing was that nobody apologized for this inconvenience but they were also rude. They just said \"we can not do anything about it; we cannot find your hat now\". This is the first time that such a thing happens in a restaurant.. Unfortunately I do not recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Food was impeccable, but the service was.. eh. Our waitress up-sold our family several times and we were already a group of 12 - buying appetizers and a few bottles of wine on top of our entrees. Once one bottle of Merlot was done (but there was still another full bottle of  blended reds), she added another full bottle of Merlot to our check because someone had said thats what they were drinking (not realizing that the merlot bottle at the other end of the table was done. Instead of saying there was still the other full bottle of red at the other end of the table and that the merlot was done, she just opened another bottle of wine. Our dad didn't make a big deal of it, but it was shady of her. Also, she pushed salads with every entree order, as though they came with the entrees (25-40 each), but then we were charged $10 each for them. We were all happy to be together again as a family, so no one made a fuss, but in retrospect, it was pretty annoying that she made our dinner more expensive than it was already going to be. 

Other than that - the food was AMAZING. Lobster Ravioli, and Seafood Risotto were two of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Think twice before heading here for lunch and getting their Quattro special.  The portions are meniscal.  There could not have been $3.00 worth of food on the plate.  I only wish I took a picture for all to see.  If anyone dares to order this please take a pic and post it.  If you use a decent camera it should be able to pick up the food on the plate.  They should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Like most reviewers have said, its overpriced.  The food is good, but not good enough to justify a $60 bill for one glass of wine and \"good\" crab cakes.  And there are no frills - no bread for the table, no sides, nada...so if I'm going to pay that much for a meal I better get more than 2 crab cakes and a glass of wine.  I was disappointed and I feel like I could spend less than that and get a fantastic meal at a place like Eleven.  

Also the service left much to be desired during our trip there.  Earlier that day, I had made reservations online but I had somehow messed up the online reservation, but called the restaurant immediately after realizing my mistake to let them know the glitch with the online reservation.  The gentleman I spoke with said he would take care of it and there would be no problem and my reservation would be changed to reflect the day/time we wanted. 

Fast forward 6 hours and the hostess was completely clueless and said that we didn't have a reservation for us.  I explained the situation from earlier that day but I was met with 3 hostess people looking at each other and the computer screen of reservations with confusion.  They talked it over and said that they would get us a table shortly...now I'm not sure what \"shortly\" means to most people, but my expectation was 5-10 minutes.  Fast forward 25 minutes later, with no updates from them during this time, it was my friend and I who were pestering them with what was going on.  We would have been find if they told us that sorry but we are unable to accommodate you, rather than having us wait in their lobby area for nearly 30 minutes!

All in all - sub par experience and I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great food! My boyfriend can be very picky at times and the were incredibly accommodating! Will be back"}
{"text":"We were here for the first time celebrating our anniversary.   Stopped in the bar area first for a drink and found the atmosphere very nice, but oddly on a Saturday night, only 2 other people.  

We were then seated in a large beautiful dining room, but nothing intimate about it.   Our romantic dinner was not to be had here.   Acoustics are horrible due to all the beautiful stone around.   The tables are very close and. Or what we had hoped at all.

I had the Caesar salad and my husband had the caprese.   I hate to say it, but it was the worst Caesar salad I have ever had.   It was served in a bowl, didn't seem like romaine lettuce, had 4 croutons, no cheese and barely any dressing.   My husband loved his caprese as it was full of flavor and the buffalo mozzarella was excellent.  I ordered the veal Parmesan and my husband had the raviolio (not sure of spelling).   The veal was very thick, which was odd, and served with a small portion of spaghetti on top.  Just ok, not great.   My husbands meal had many different flavors.   There was braised beef, egg, and other things which he said made every bite taste different.  He liked it, didn't love it.   Not sure why they asked if we were celebrating anything special when we made the reservation as nobody ever mentioned our anniversary.

As we were finishing, the people next to us were brought Caesar salads that looked very traditional.   They were served on plates, romaine lettuce, cheese and more croutons.   I hadn't planned on saying anything to the server, but once I saw the other ones I had to.   She kindly removed the charge from our bill.

Service wasn't great, and as I mentioned, the acoustics are bad so hard to have conversation.   Wanted to like this place more as its so pretty, but likely not to return."}
{"text":"My parents came into town the night before I was to move out of Pittsburgh. Since they were staying at the fairmont, we didn't want to stray too far from Downtown. We all agreed that italian food was what we were craving and after googling the menu, Vallozzi's seemed perfect. 

First of all, make a reservation. Otherwise you will get the pretentious once-over and will be pointed, (yes, pointed) towards the \"lounge\" to...seat yourself. Call me crazy, but a place that offers the exact same menu (and pricing!) in two separate dining areas should never be 'seat yourself'. That threw me off. So, as we settled into our backless benches in the beautifully decorated self seating area, we took a look at the menu and waited for our waitress.

Strike two. The waitress came over, a dark haired girl who I regrettably did not get the name of, and it was all downhill from there. My dad asked what beers they might have on draft. This is a perfectly normal question, in my opinion. They had, what appeared to be, a full service bar. Not like we could see it entirely as they had higher seating filled between our bench seats and said bar. Anyway, she replied, \"I don't have drafts.\" Okay...are we going to offer an alternative here? No? Alrighty then. So my dad names a random bottle and she says, as snooty as possible (yes, I used the word 'snooty'), \"Sir, I don't *have* that on bottle.\" Oh! Okay! So.......oh, we're still playing the no alternatives game. My father, getting flustered with her lack of customer service skills, \"Alright, well can you tell me what you might have since you don't have a beer list?\" After listening to her blatantly rushed tone, he just picked the second thing she said. My mom orders. She comes to me and I say, \"I'm going to look at the drink menu a bit more and order when you come back so water for now, please.\" Ladies and gents, I did not ever get that mixed drink. The two times she came back to bring my parent's drinks, I tried to speak and she walked away. Alright, I'll take this delicious water. Thanks!

And so we come to strike three. Because the menu is somewhat vast, (which is great! I loved that they gave us options!) my mother asked the waitress what is popular on the menu. The waitress replies, \"We don't really have anything particularly popular. Everything is great.\" .....WHAT?! Now, while I've never personally served, I do have many friends in the industry. When someone asks you 'should I get this vs. this', you should probably have an answer. Or you maybe should know what a popular item is on your menu. Like I said, I have many friends in the service industry so I make sure to always be as courteous as possible and tip well. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore. As she was rambling off something unintelligible to my mom, I scoffed, shook my head, and looked at my father, \"How can you be a waitress somewhere and not know what a popular seller is on your menu?\" 

Needless to say, the rest of our meal she was very fake nice, we probably had a hocker in our pasta, and I had to physically stop myself from being polite to her. Also, my parents always tip 25%+ and I can confirm that this lady got a tip that matched her sour attitude. Maybe she was having an off night, maybe she had too many tables and was overwhelmed. Not my problem and I'm bummed my parents and I had to experience it.

And after all this angry, waste of my time rambling, I do also have to confirm that portions were disappointing and the taste was just, 'so, what?'"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  My friends and I dined their last night at a recommendation of someone who works down town and frequents down town Pittsburgh.  We are so glad we followed up on the recommendation. 
FOOD: We had a bottle Montelpuciano red wine that paired nicely with all of our meals. We had the fried ciliegine for an appetizer and it was delicious--- a fancy and upscale version of fried mozzarella. Also, they provided complementary bread with ricotta cheese and herbs.  The ricotta cheese and herbs was unusually tasty. 
The roasted beet salad was just okay. 
The Bucatini Carbonara was superb! Perhaps the best thing on the menu!

Dessert:  We had an order of the delicious bread pudding.  It was served very hot with fresh caramel. The red wine paired perfectly with it. 

AMBIANCE:  
The mural against the back wall made you feel like you might actually be in a restaurant in Tuscany, Italy rather than Pittsburgh! i
Comfortable seating
Low noise level

{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Vallozzi's and would highly recommend it to others. I noticed a lot of the less favorable reviews mention price in proportion to the food. I think it's important to note that this is a fine dining establishment and the price you are paying is for the quality, not the quantity. This isn't the Cheesecake Factory.

We ordered a lot of plates and shared among the table. The beef entrecôte was really cool. They bring it with a piping hot Himalayan salt stone to cook the meat. I can also recommend the shishito peppers, burrata, prosciutto plate, roasted beet salad, and the suckling pig papardelle. Everything was exceptional.

The server was also very attentive and accommodating. We requested toasted bread with one of the appetizers in lieu of the regular bread and the server quickly obliged. Also, I liked that they serve ricotta with the bread."}
{"text":"A nice, classy restaurant that sits in downtown Pittsburgh, Vallozzis is a great place to go for a date or special occasion.

The decor inside is very well-done; you can tell they really tried to put together an Italian feel. The lighting is also done well so that the ambiance is pretty dark, so that you have more privacy when you're eating. The tables are dimly lit by a single candle, which is nice except that they often burn out if a breeze passes by. Minor problem but it was annoying during my dinner. The service here is super professional, and you'll be impressed by how the waiters describe the dishes to you and how they move around the restaurant.

As for the food, my meat sauce pasta was excellent. There was the perfect blend of meat and sauce, and the al dente pasta really added that extra kick that just made the meal super satisfying. I also got to try a seafood alfredo pasta, which I wasn't as much impressed by. I thought the sauce was way too salty and seafood being naturally salty just made it worse. 

But overall, I had a fabulous time at Vallozzis, and really want to try out what other pastas they have to offer."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 11:30 for lunch with my coworkers. Our table reserved for 7 was set-up and we were sat immediately. We definitely beat the lunch rush, as it didn't start to fill until closer to 12:15. Simple breakdown...

Service: Excellent. The waitstaff is well-educated about the menu and as a former server, they hit all the marks for fine dining. The staff is friendly and make for a delightful experience. They offer complimentary coat check upon arrival.

Food: Our table ordered 3 chicken Parmesans, a spinach pizza, a chicken Waldorf salad, seared tuna salad and a grouping...the grouping meal is a neat concept. They have 4 groups to choose from and each group has 3 different types of food. You order one item from each group. For example, the dish at our table included beef tenderloin, shrimp with salsa, gnocchi and mozzarella basil salad. The portions are all tapas size but all together, it makes for a solid meal. Great way to sample different parts of the menu. No complaints about the food. I had the seared tuna salad and the taste was better than expected. I do not usually mix citrus with in my salads but the glaze on the grapefruit and oranges in this dish paired nicely with the bitter punch of the arugula. 

The only reason I cannot issue 5 stars is that my meal was the priciest...and the smallest, with limited variety. The salad is served on a plate and not in a bowl. The only toppings are tuna, oranges and grapefruit. I would have felt that I got my moneys worth if the salad was arugula plus mixed greens with select vegetables mixed in.      

Decor: classy and rustic. Exposed stone walls and dried flowers pressed into the doors. Beautiful! 

The menu lists an option for GF pasta and for that reason, I will probably go back. Their pasta dishes sounded amazing and I love any chance to try a restaurant that caters to gluten intolerance!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal here when in town for a conference recently.  4 of us shared the mozzarella sampler and the meat one as well.  All went quickly and were amazing with the ricotta being a surprise favorite for me.  The standard salad is delicious with a lemon vinaigrette, crushed pistachio and Parmesan.  My entree was simply brilliant. Homemade pappardelle with suckling pig, mushrooms and fennel.  The sauce was amazing and the portion was substantial. If I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again I will go back here just so I could eat this dish again.  I can taste it right now.....I'm sorry, where was I?   
My dining companions loved their dishes (gnocchi, raviolo and seafood risotto) and I tasted a pistachio cannoli at dessert.  They have a wonderful truffle menu with $2.50 options.  Who can say no to that?  
Service was great, wine flowed. Awesome experience"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and Italian wine list. Tried this place for dinner after a day of conference meetings and had a great time. Service was excellent and food hit the mark."}
{"text":"We were at the restaurant for the first time celebrating our anniversary.  When I first arrived I was initially impressed but that soon faded.  The stone walls were pretty but the murals on the walls were hard to figure out - whoever painted them was not talented at all.  The one wall looked like a desert scene - we couldn't figure it out and the other, we think, was a very faded sky.  The only thing that went with the Italian theme were the stone walls.  I ordered wine and it was served in a glass used for sodas.  I had to ask for a wine glass and evidentially had to take my own from an empty table.  The soup was delicious but the Caesar salad was dry with no cheese.  The restaurant's highlight (thank goodness there was one) was the veal - it was  delicious.  But, I wouldn't go back just for the veal - many restaurants have good veal.  The one disturbing feature was the music.  We were in an Italian restaurant and Michael Jackson and other popular songs were being played.  As I was eating I could feel the thumping beat of the music.  How nice it would have been and how appropriate it would have been to have some type of soft Italian music.  The restaurant had many empty tables but instead of spacing people throughout the restaurant people were seated on both sides of our small table for 2.  Our tables were much too close - hard to have a conversation without involving the people seating next to us.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Steak and potatoes were cold after waiting over an hour for the main course.  While the steak was a nice cut of meat, the prep and cook made it very bland."}
{"text":"My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and we very looking forward to dining at Vallozzis. Reviews on TA and Yelp are very positive and we love Italian food.

First impressions - Very Good! when I made the reservation via Open Tabl, I note that we were celebrating our anniversary and requested a table that fit the occasion, if possible. We arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and were greeted by the hostess who offed congratulations on the occasion. She asked us to take a seat in the bar until our table was ready. The bar area is large and open with some high top table. The atmosphere is nice and we looked forward to a great experience.

In using the Men's Room, I passed through the main dining area, which was very crowded and noisy. There were several two top tables open that were lined up on the far wall and sandwiched in between other tables. As I note this, I was happy that I had made the point of requesting a nice table. There were other smaller rooms and so I was sure we would be pleased with our table assignment. 

Down Hill from there - much to my surprise and disappointment, when we were escorted to our table, we were seated at one of the tables in the main dining room that was open when AI had passed by 15 minutes earlier. My wife, who is petite, could barely squeeze by the table next to us to take her seat. UNBELIEVABLE! Because it was a special evening for us, I did not want want to make fuss as it might upset my wife.

Service - Well Below Average, at best. our server was nice but seemed clueless and she was hardly attentive. Despite the fact that the staff was aware that we were celebrating our anniversary, we were seated at one of the worst tables and not offered so much as a glass of wine, nor a basic dessert! 

Food - average and over-priced. My wife ordered veal parm and I ordered  the braised beef ravioli. Both entrees were average. The veal was very thick and the red sauce bland. My dish was also on the bland side and the beef was not as tender as it should have been. 

Atmosphere - beyond poor, unless you enjoy tables that are about 12\" apart, located in a room with lousy acoustics. It was so loud, our ears were ringing when we left the restaurant. 

FYI - I was concerned that I was being a little too critical and so I asked the couple seated next to us what they though of their meal and the dining experience. Their opinion was the same as our opinion, even though I did not share our opinion it's them until afterwards.

Conclusion - with so many new and highly rated restaurants downtown, I can not recommend Vallozzis."}
{"text":"Ambiance: nice! Waiter: very good! Wine selection: great! Food: meh....not so much. 

For the price, go to Il Pizzaiolo --- food is much better there."}
{"text":"The first time I visited, I had an AWFUL lobster roll.  I love lobster rolls so much, so you can imagine how much I was disappointed.  I vowed to never return.  
However, a decent amount of my co-workers insisted it was one of their favorite lunch spots.  After months and months of resistance, I finally went back.  
I got the choose 4 option for lunch, which was pretty cool.  I love to try different things, so I feel like this was a great option.  Prosciutto wrapped melon, mushroom mac and cheese, Brussels, and grilled salmon.  All were good.  I saved the salmon for last.  It was my least favorite because of the completely different flavor profile it had from the other dishes.  It was packed with Asian flavors, and it sort of shocked my taste buds.  The tastes being so profoundly different than the rest of my meal really threw me off.  I definitely wasn't expecting that flavor profile to be in any dish at an Italian restaurant.  
I'm sure it will be some time before I return, but after round 2, Vallozzi's somewhat redeemed itself.  Just take my advice and STAY AWAY from the lobster roll."}
{"text":"Good bisque soup & salad.
Great portions on Crabcakes - taste good too.
Great friendly service that is very professional."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have never been to Vallozzi's restaurant.   It's next to my new office and I have walked past there a gazillion times and I've never gone in. (For some reason, I thought that the menu was overpriced and I should have done my homework.  It's not really overpriced.)
First of all, I love a good looking restaurant and Vallozzi's is a good looking restaurant.  I would apply the words, serene, tranquil and relaxing to the environment there.  (I'm surprised that they don't have a spa tucked away behind a hidden wall...)  I felt extremely relaxed during my lunch there and I think that the rest of the patrons felt the same way because everyone spoke in hushed tones while I was there.

My lunch partner said that they go to lunch there at least once a week couldn't believe that I had never been there, considering my food, ahem, addiction.  Well, I hadn't but I wished that I would have because I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch.  I ordered the $16 GRILLED SALMON with creamy polenta and mushroom ragout.  My lunch partner ordered the $11 VALLOZZI pizza with tomato sauce and provolone.  He also asked our server to add pepperoni.

I really enjoyed my grilled salmon.  It was properly cooked and not dried out in the center and the polenta had a great consistency while the mushroom ragout rounded out the dish perfectly.  I also tried the pizza and the crust had a nice chew and the sauce wasn't overly reduced and bitter.  Very deft hands handled that pizza pie and I was extremely pleased.

I know that $16 is a little much for lunch, but I enjoyed the food, the service and the surroundings.  Overall, a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Vallozzis and I gotta say the food here was really good. There was little bit of wait for the food. But definitely worth it. If you are visiting town would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise.  Vallozzi's Pgh just opened up and is beautiful.  Stonework around the entry ways, wood on the ceiling in the bar, darker and quieter with a big mural on the wall in the dining area.

Was walking by and looking for a lunch spot.  There it was.   Sat in the bar and watched some of the NCAA basketball on the TV's.

Probably a little more expensive for lunch than an everyday place but some items are really reasonably priced.

How can you go wrong with the gnocchi.  Grandma Vallozzi's recipe is perfect. The gnoochi was tender and perfectly cooked with some pesto, aged balsamic, fresh cooked cherry tomato halves. and a big dollop or ricotta.  

The menu has Grandma V's ravioli too!  There are soups, salads, Sandwiches, Vallozzi Pizza and some entree's.  The bar has a fresh mozzarella bar too!.

If you are looking for top quality, good tasting Italian, Vallozzi's has it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, service was good but a little slow. I don't think it was the server's fault but rather the kitchen. The food was OK but over priced. Don't get the candy for dessert, one tiny little piece for $2.50. Over all it was OK but I doubt that I will be back."}
{"text":"A very nice Italian restaurant and the food was delicious, the service was also very good. The salad I had was so good and different the dressing was fabulous . The attire for this restaurant is casual work."}
{"text":"Valentine's Dinner. We had the Buffalo 2 ways appetiser as well as the tuna tartare. Salads and a house made pasta with suckling pig that was delicious. I had crab cakes as my entrée and the husband had the veal oso bucco both were very good. Service and wine recommendations by the GM made the night at extra special. A wonderful evening, the perfect place for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Vallozzis in the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh is a great spot for business lunch and dinner. You can expect a decent wine selection, a well-sorted menu, and attentive service - exactly what you'd want from an upscale Italian restaurant. 

While I was mostly satisfied with the food - especially the burrata (soft and creamy, $13) and the Crab Cake ($39.95), other items didn't meet expectations, especially the Osso Buco ($44), which lacked taste and came on a risotto that was al dente.

Our group was placed in a separate dining room without windows, not much atmosphere there. I recommend you to request the main dining room facing the street.

Overall, I found the prices a bit outrageous for Pittsburgh (I'd expect that in San Francisco), and my experience didn't justify charging ~$80 for an appetizer, entree, and two drinks."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice,we felt it was a little pricey for the food we had.service was good"}
{"text":"Delicious And Elegant!! My girlfriend and I started our first Light Up Night at Vallozzi's and it was a great start to the evening! Great wine selection helped us kick things off before our main courses of Crab Cakes for her and The Study of Prime Rib for me!! The seasonal sorbet dessert was excellent! Our waiter Rick was On Point!! Great time was had by all! I highly suggest this place for a nice night out!!"}
{"text":"For Hurricane Irma refugees, Pittsburgh is an ideal refuge and Vallozzis is the place to eat. People turn up their noses and make a funny face when you say the word \"Pittsburgh\", and even our cab driver laughed out loud when we asked for a ride to the cultural district. But nestled in the heart of downtown is one the best Italian restaurants I have EVER been to... The place is absolutely gorgeous!!! It looks like Chef Ramsay put it together as it is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. One entire wall is an Italian countryside scene while another is adorned with massive clouds but its the wooden tables and bar that truly stand out... But, of course, it was the food that compelled me to make a next night reservation on the way out the door. The pizza carne appetizer (bathed in arugula) had the most unusual flavor I have ever tasted in an Italian restaurant! Its flavor profile was a garlic-ham hybrid that was a true culinary masterpiece... I was full when my gnocchi and sausage arrived but I surreptiously licked the bowl clean when nobody was looking! It tasted like a pizzaiola I ate canalside in Venice, a few years back; YES, it was THAT good!!! There must be a plethora of fine dining establishments in Pittsburgh if this place only gets three and a half yelp stars! We may be here awhile and Vallozzis will be my go to spot for the duration! Va bene!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh recently for a work event and it should tell you something that our group went here for dinner two nights in a row! 

This restaurant is great to work with if you have a private group dinner that you want to arrange. They can help you set up a pre-selected menu and offer suggestions to guide your menu choices. Plus, they don't require an exorbitant food and drink minimum like some of the other nearby restaurants do. 

Most importantly, the food is delicious here and the service was very good as well. The memorable choices that stand out to me were the arancini appetizer ($10 for this one) which is fried risotta balls served with buffalo mozzarella and marinara. Our table was fighting for every bite of this appetizer. 

I ordered the caprese salad for myself ($14) and the presentation of fresh tomatoes, delicious mozzarella, and basil were just what I needed after a few days of conference food. For my main course, I ordered the ricotta ravioli at $18 and it was delicious and I even had enough for leftovers the next day.

All their pastas are made in-house and they also have select gluten free pastas which delighted one of my colleagues who eats a restricted gluten free diet. The pasta dishes range in price from $16-36 and they also have a section primarily for 'carne' (meat) dishes. 

This place has a nice relaxed atmosphere and is willing to accommodate you and your group as best they can. I approve."}
