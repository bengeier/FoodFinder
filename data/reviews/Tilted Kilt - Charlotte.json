{"text":"Trying to give this place a chance. My experience was good. Bartender Rachel and one server Nicole were engaging and professional. But I noticed a guy standing at the front door waiting for the hostess. Wow. That should never happen. That area has very little competition so the TK should be cleaning up for lunch and dinner. I mean its a sports bar, with food, drinks and TK girls/women. Need to step their game up big time or the door will close again."}
{"text":"Just to let everyone know, these are NEW owners and all new staff at Tilted Kilt!! A lot of work has gone into refurbishing! The menu is amazing, the place is great looking , there are all new televisions, there's a pool table and other games to play! Everyone is very friendly and eager to make it worth your while !! Go in for lunch, dinner, drinks, watch the games, make some new friends and I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised how much it's changed ! Again, it is not reopened by previous owners, spread the word!! I'll attach photos!! It's our new hangout !!

My fave is pub pretzel and mango mule to drink , pretzel comes with two cheese dips and Dijon mustard dip!! The sampler is really good , gives an opportunity to try different apps and love the Asian barbecue pork with rice and veggies, yum!!!
Don't forget to try the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert !!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. From the food to the service I'd highly recommend. If you go here ask for Shelby, she's the best!"}
{"text":"We dined on Mon March 26 , 1:30 PM
Only 4 other tables occupied. Food was okay , service was bad.  After waiting 30 minutes, i had to get up and run down our server to tell her that we were ready to order. In the meantime we spent 45 minutes listening to staff interviewing prospective employees. One at a booth behind us and another at a table across from us. Very unprofessional .
We will never return to Tilted Kilt."}
{"text":"If you are going to splurge, this is the place to do it. Friendly prompt service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Great experience! My husband and I have visited twice and enjoyed both the cocktails along with the food. We have also always received great service! Taco Tuesday was great! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"On the trip home me and the wife stopped at the Tilted Kilt. We were greeted at the door by 3 lovely Ladies. We were seated in Chelsea's section. Chelsea gave us some fun ribbing because we are Georgia fans and she likes Bama. She recommended the special of Stella and I got a free glass because it was the months special. Chelsea also recommended the burgers for me and my wife. The crew in the back did a excellent job and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back to see Miss Chelsea and crew. Place was very clean and has a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. We Walked in and there was no one at the front to seat us. A young lady came and said she would be right back and then a gentleman came shortly after. He sat us near the door but since the restataunt was kind of crazy with all of the bikers there, he ended up being our waiter. He was super cool. I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich and fries. By the way, they have really great fries. They were seasoned and they came out hot. It didn't take long for the food to come out. They had a live band so it was pretty loud but that didn't bother us.  They have alot of tv's and a pool table along with a few other games. Our waiter was very friendly and flamboyant and we loved every bit of it. 

I was hesitant when my husband said we were coming here for dinner but I'm glad we did. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! The Gaelic chicken was great! I wasn't expecting that! My server was a beautiful girl named Kayla who had the most nicest personality! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well this location was a Tilted Kilt previously. It used to be filthy and closed down. A couple years later now, and it has very recently reopened. Looks pretty much the exact same on the inside, but a good bit cleaner, thankfully. They didn't seem to have been open long when I went early this week. Probably the typical opening-type problems like slow service and not-so-great food. I am sure they will have learned their lesson from last time and improve very quickly. I will update my review after giving them a little time. As for now, it is a typical sports bar for the Steele Creek area, and good to have another option."}
{"text":"This place seemed really interesting when I drove by on a business trip I had in Charlotte. I was indeed looking for something out of the ordinary so I chose this place. And I'm glad I did.

My servers name was Meredith and she was very friendly and suggested several things on the menu. And trust me when I tell, I know some servers put on a fake smile and let their outfits do all the talking. Meredith genuinely liked her job and ahe showed it. 

She highly suggested the Shepards Pie so went with that. It arrived about 15 mints later, served piping hot. To be honest, I thought the portion looked small (cause I was starving) however it ended up being perfect size. 

While they have plenty of appetizers to choose from, I'm glad I didn't. 

This place has a full bar where you sit there, at high tops or traditional tables. This place reminds of a Hooters, British style. However, they are a lot classier that Hooters. 

Will def be back when I'm in the Charlotte area. And by the way, they are indeed a chain. Did not know that but now I do."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pub! The waitresses are GORGEOUS and extremely kind, they have games to play such as pool and giant jenga!  The food isn't the best but it's a really wobderful environment and I can't wait to go back!


One thing I have to say is some of the patrons are extremely rude and disrespectful to the girls there. So if you see a guy being a creep please try to intervene or support the girl being harassed."}
{"text":"Charlotte location wow .... good news 1st the uniforms are cute but the food is awful I order MONTE CRISTO which was just one Fried lump of bread consist of one piece of thin deli meat and not sure of cheese with lots of wet greasy bread... the waitress never did come over to ask was everything OK .... so guess what I will never return.  I can suggest a great restaurant called copper pub lake Wylie!"}
{"text":"This isn't my first time at the rodeo...er Tilted Kilt :P I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to Tilted Kilts, having been to one in three different states. Compared to the others, the one in Charlotte takes the cake. The service is on point, the food decent for pub fare, and the drinks flowing like a raging river. 

The service. In the two times I visited, I was impressed with the attention to detail provided by my servers. I don't recall the first server's name, however during my most recent visit, Felicia provided top notch service. Her recommendations for food and drinks exceeded our expectations and made the experience more enjoyable. 5/5 stars for her.

The food. Not bad for pub food, but let's be honest - you don't come to Tilted Kilt for its food. Ordered the nachos sans meat, Tilted tots, and other munchies from the menu and all were good, considering that they were your basic fare. 4/5 stars for the food. 

The drinks. I'm a beer guy, and that's why Tilted Kilt's vast selection of drafts is a go-to for me. Nothing beats a nice cold beer poured after a long hike up nearby Crowders Mountain, and Tilted Kilt more satisfied with its offerings. 


Overall, this is a good place to come. If you're in the mood for some bar games, take in your fill of giant Jenga, arcade games and that one with the long board and sand and little things sliding across it (I know my description sucks but y'all get the point). Couldn't recommend this place more!"}
{"text":"The servers were very attentive and nice people. The steak and cheese nachos were mostly chips with very little toppings. We ordered wings which it states on the menu as 1 pound. We received 6 small wings. The place overall was kind of dead and it was a playoff game night. czarsfoodblog.com does NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time in this location.  Well, the last too.  We had to wait for menus, then no napkins or flatware when food arrives.  Bloody Mary was almost all Worcestershire sauce.  Waitress was sweet and attentive, but untrained.  Good was actually not bad- nachos and a pretzel.  
Went to watch a playoff football game, and I guess considering the small crowd, everyone knows there are better options for a sports bar."}
{"text":"So, Round Two of Kilt's attempt at South Charlotte has failed in epic fashion once again.  They clearly have poor funding if they can only afford to supply the kitchen with one type of sweetener for your tea. The food is mediocre at best, and that's only if you order strictly from the \"Appetizer Page\" of their uninspiring menu.  As with most struggling restaurants, if you can only pull off appetizers with success, then your overall menu will fail.  Honestly, it's sad when a business is in this close of a proximity to a tourist destination, Carowinds, and still fail at the attempt.  Here's to hoping they close down again for a couple years, and then attempt Round Three down the road.  The one highlight in the experience was the service.  Hats off to the staff more making the best of the hand they've been dealt."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and we had a couponbuy one get one free.  We were seated but a guy in a kilt and very very friendly.  The waitress we had was great, best service ever.  We were celebrating our 15yr Anniversary.   We started with spicy pickle fries and wow o wow were they great.... We had the blackened chicken pasta with green, red bell peppers and we had them add mushrooms,  wow it was over the top great!!  The live band on Friday night.  The music was a bit to loud, but it was good...  The female's had little to no clothes on less than Hooters and a lot of boob showing not a kid place.  Think twice before bring the kids!!! Wow o wow... Again service was on spot.."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend of mine around 9:30 on a Monday night. Wanted to catch the NBA playoffs. Bigscreen TV was on the game but there was no sound.  Guess they don't want to pay for the licensing. Asked for menus. Told us that the kitchen was closed. All they had was chips and salsa. Didn't ask for chips and salsa but soon a gentleman came by and dropped off some chips and salsa to us and another guest sitting at the bar. The chips were stale, and the salsa was borderline rancid. But hey i figured why complain as they were free. WRONG. We asked for our check and there was a 4.50 charge for the chips and salsa. Really hoped this place had changed from the previous Tilted Kilt that had gone out of business in the same location. Will not return."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place
Is the girl that took my order, Kristen. What a great customer service experience. Other than that, the \"boneless wings\" were dry and barely coated with sauce, like they were thrown in a to go box and drizzled with barely any sauce on top. I expected more from a new place trying to make and keep business. The manager was supposed to call me back and never did. Big disappoint al around."}
{"text":"Since their reopening I have been there 5 times . Every time I have been has been a delight. Everyone is very cordial . If you go ask for Chelsea. By far my favorite. The only thing I miss is the Pastrami sandwich. Hopefully they bring it back."}
{"text":"First place I have found a decent Monte Cristo since leaving California. Great service, very friendly and attentive. Went there for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"French dip was good fries were very good the pigeon wings sucked and the tots were ok
Decent service"}
{"text":"Late night menu is not worth it if you're actually hungry. Enjoyed the tilted kilt view and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my family. Had a great experience. The location was clean, easily accessible. Kids eat free on Saturday which we only just now figured out. 

Our waitress, Taylor B, was phenomenal. She was quick, attentive and kind. Perfect service! One of the main reasons I will come back. 

The food was delicious. We ate the beer battered fish and chips and it was excellent! Fresh, warm and tasty! 

Had a great beer selection. Angry orchard is my favorite and they had it available! Yummmm! 

Great experience will be coming back here! 

Thank you Taylor!"}
