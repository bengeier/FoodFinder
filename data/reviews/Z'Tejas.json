{"text":"Have been going here for years, and getting...and loving the cornbread.  However, as of the 1st of the month, they started charging $3.00 for the cornbread...but neglect to mention that.

I would think if they changed the policy just a couple of weeks ago that they would now inform customers that they are charging for cornbread...which was free."}
{"text":"One word: yum! I came here for happy hour and got a ton of food for not much dough. Their tableside guac is so good. I love that you can customize it. I always go for lots of cilantro and lime. The pork nachos were delightful and really filling. Half price bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I love this place for meetings! There is just enough buzz to keep things relaxed and a professional enough atmosphere to hold meetings at."}
{"text":"Ya know, I almost thought about giving Z-Tejas five stars just for having a separate, gluten-free menu, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because the service was way below what I expect when I eat out.

We, a party of five (including my parents, who were visiting from Scotland), were initially seated at a really cramped table when several booths were open. Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.

Our server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related \"episode.\" Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions. I almost handed her back my gluten-free steak and vegs. My give up...

The food, when it did finally arrive, was good, albeit a little bland in my case. Why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me. I wish Gordon Ramsay would come in and rescue kitchens from their gluten-free nightmares. My parents both enjoyed their meals; they ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans. My son enjoyed his cheeseburger, but then what kid doesn't? And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy). 

Next time, I'll try the chambord margarita. I don't think I can go wrong with that -- at least it's alleged to taste good and it's gluten-free. =) I will, however, be checking out the restaurant in Tempe and not coming back to the one in Chandler."}
{"text":"Delicious food, awesome drinks and always great service. This is the only place I'll willingly order a salad as an entree and it's soooo good and actually fills you up. This place is legit"}
{"text":"I'm writing to update a pretty negative review I wrote a few months ago because I had three really poor experiences in a row at the Chandler location. Within 48 hours (I also emailed the review to their direct customer service email), I was contacted by multiple top managers in the company. What was even more amazing was that they didn't try to say \"Oh, we don't have any idea why that happened to you\" or \"that must have been a fluke.\" Instead, they acknowledged that they were already working through issues at that location, apologized repeatedly, thanked me for my feedback, and sent me gift cards with the promise that when I next returned I would have a different experience. And I have! I have been back twice since giving up on them and there is a marked difference - huge improvement in management and staff attitude/customer service, better food quality control, and just an overall happier vibe. I am back to thinking of Z as my \"go to\" place for brunch, happy hour, date night and business meetings alike."}
{"text":"Money margaritas!  They hit u slow but guarantee a good night"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Z-Tejas.  My favorite is the Jerk Chicken Salad, but I've also had some great scallops there.  The cornbread is always delicious, and they're famous for their margaritas."}
{"text":"I visited Z'Tejas earlier today with 14 coworkers. We made a reservation ahead of time, which was confirmed this morning when the restaurant staff called me, and the food and service were both great. We were provided with 2 servers to help things run smoothly and it worked out really well. The only issues: one server forgot to bring my coworker her drink, but she apologized and made it right immediately upon realizing it; we had just a little back and forth with the order of the checks being passed out (almost all were individual). I really can't fault the servers, though...we were 15 people and 12 of us wanted our own bill. It was fixed quickly and all with a smile and professionalism. All in all, an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Ok, I actually really like Z Tejas, but last time we visited, the tap water was so disgusting that I have to say something.  To the management team: do whatever you have to do to fix the water situation.  You'll make the cost back on just my visits alone and I am sure others have the same problem.  Lastly, do you really clean the lettuce with that stuff?  To the chef: until this is fixed, use bottled in the kitchen, it's worth it.

One last note, the water taste has been a consistent issue, I've just always ignored it because we like the food so much and can avoid it with tea or coke.  This last time...it was so bad that it crossed the line and required me to adjust my review."}
{"text":"Had a server named Stacy who perhaps was having a bad day. Rolling your eyes at guests is not exactly \"great service.\" Not the best service, not freindly, food ok but not likely to return."}
{"text":"With the woman in my life enjoying an awesome dinner ! Great Margaritas! You must try the frozen one."}
{"text":"Ive lived in ahwatukee my whole life and have been to ztejas years ago but my experience a couple days ago truly shows what i was missing out on. I forgot the servers name but he was a tall younger man with long hair. He did have a red pocket square and looked like the only one with one on (very nice touch to the plain black uniforms by the way) My fiance and I are not really big Margarita drinkers but he recommended the chambord blended margarita and it was ammaaziinnggg. We had the queso appetizer which was delicious! I ordered the shrimp and chicken diablo pasta (by our servers recommendation again)  and the plate was prepared perfectly! I usually go to oreganos for this similar plate but ztejas blows them out of the water! The place and bathrooms looked very clean also. Everything from the food to the service and the cleanliness was on point! I really wish i rememberd the servers name so he could receive  acknowledgement for his great service. We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Middle of the road  average lunch experience. Typical of Ahwatukee'a sea of chain restaurants. This concept is tired the food is bland, and the vibe is too. You can do worse in Tukee, go across the street and try red lobster!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the area!
$5 signature margaritas, and $6, $7, and $8 appetizers! Portions are great for sharing.
Service is always AWESOME, the servers here know what they are doing and will make sure you always leave happy.
Listen to the servers recommendations if you aren't sure what to order, they will make sure you love your meal.
And of course, the cornbread is the best! It comes to the table fresh out of the oven in a hot cast iron skillet with honey butter. It is made with yogurt to make it fluffy, yet rich. It's perfection."}
{"text":"Made reservation because had other engagements. Showed up and waited twenty minutes. They said sorry people who have your table haven't left yet. As if they only have one table. When we informed them of our time constraints. They made no offer to help out. Like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation. And really that's the most important part"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because it was close to our hotel and only had a twenty-minute wait on a Friday night (which is really short for Friday night.). While we waited outside, the manager offered us drinks and took the time to chat with us and our children to help pass the time.

Inside, the service continued to be exceptional.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing and the manager checked in with us as well.  The food was delicious and well prepared too!"}
{"text":"We discovered Z'Tejas in Bellevue, WA.  Unfortunately, that location closed so we were happy to find when we moved to Chandler that there are a couple of locations in this area.

The food is identical to what we were used to in WA.  Their chicken chile relleno has a wonderful mix of flavors and is presented well.  And their cornbread is the best.

Service has always been great for us, even on our last visit when our server had a table of 20 plus three other tables and was still able to take our order, deliver the food piping hot, and check back a few times to make sure everything was as expected.

I'm looking forward to our next night out at Z'Tejas."}
{"text":"We come here often for happy hour and love the margaritas. Last two times the tejas trio has been disappointing. The queso dip has been runny and not the same."}
{"text":"So with all the reviews that I read I didn't know if I should try it or not and opted to give it a shot since I had never been. We got cornbread, chips and salsa, Diablo pasta with shrimp and the New York strip.

My husband seemed to enjoy the cornbread, I think he was hungry.  The chips and salsa were chips and salsa. The steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare but needed a lot of salt. My first bite of my Diablo pasta I made a face because it was something about the flavor. It was Rosemary. I don't like Rosemary. The pasta was not overcooked it would've been more enjoyable if I like the flavor. 

So we discussed if we would ever come back and probably not. But if we did we would probably order something else. 

Our waiter was friendly!

It was noisy but not too bad. I could still hear my husband talking across  table.  So we gave it a shot and onto the next."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! We had a large party for brunch, but the waitress handled everyone's request with ease. The service was fantastic; the food came out quickly, and accurately. Everything was delicious and the make your own drink bar was original and fun. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour gets crazy busy! Must be the fantastic chambord margaritas (limit 3) and appetizers! I'm a huge fan of the Tejas trio dips and the pecan crusted chicken salad."}
{"text":"Z how much do I love thee? Let me count the ways... This is not your everyday Mexican food restaurant, they put their own extremely delicous spin on it.  Always good service and more often then not some real eye candy servers too =P Their Margarita's are the best in the valley, very tasty and strong! Well worth the price.  The complimentary corn bread is good but the butter it comes with is the best part, so sweet and delicious, definitely elevates the cornbread.  Shrimp tostada bites, best appetizer ever invented! Some days I just get these as my main meal so I do not have to share.  This is a must on the list when we bring newbies.  Every main dish I've ever had at Z has been great, love the Tortilla Soup, love their Salads, their Trout and Salmon are always so tasty, they do rice and beans perfectly.  I'd have to say where Z really shines though is their weekend brunch.  First you've got the bloody mary bar with all the fixings.  Then brunch comes with cornbread and delicious fresh baked muffins, a delicious sorbet & fruit palette cleanser and the main dish is always so scrumptious.  My favorites are the barbacoa enchiladas, the breakfast enchiladas and the chile quilles.  Sooooooo much food for an extremely reasonable price.  This is why I hit up Z's at least once or twice a month. Love it!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar to watch Kansas beat Ohio and were treated to a royal show by our rockstar bartender Aaron.  The food was so amazing we returned the next day for your last dinner together for our trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch today.  Can't give this place much more credence than I would an Applebee's, though.  Ordered the avacado turkyburger and requested well done steak fries.  Burger was dry and overly herby, fries were NOT well done and not even done-done in my opinion - sorta stale even.  Free corn bread is a nice perk cuz it's quite good and served very hot in a little fancy cast-iron pan with a big 'ol steak knife for servin' & a side a' butter.  Everyone you talk to who has been to Z'Tejas will mention the corn bread, the corn bread, the corn bread.  Yippie yay.   It managed to upstage my $11 turkey-blah-ger.  So, congrats, overachieving cornbread, to a job well done!

Service:  Our server was friendly and attentive and she let us talk prior to ordering without interrupting us.  Generally a good vibe here.

Food overall is just...meh, in my opinion.  I didn't try my companions entrees at all, though they had no complaints.   The food here reminded me of Rainforest Cafe - the smells, the portions, the prices. Just not my thing."}
{"text":"My husband raves about the burgers (yes at a Southwestern grill). I personally enjoy the Diablo pasta. Their anniversary margarita is AMAZING, and a 2nd one is even better :-)"}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar. Got my drink order right away. But the waitress took 20 min before even coming back to my seat to see if I was eating dinner there. 

There are a total of 5 people at the bar and 7 people at the tables around the bar including myself. The waitress walks up to the same 3 tables and talks to the guests but is ignoring me and one other table with two people. The couple next to me are obviously pissed and actually just walked out as I was typing this.

Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"The service is inconsistent, but the food is always good - so I'm a fan. 

To elaborate, the menu is an interesting mix of Tex-mex Americana. They have enchiladas on the menu and right next to it a plain ol' burger! 

All their salads are great! And, I'm not a girl who \"craves\" salads. If I'm going to crave anything it will be peppered french fries. But, man, I crave the z-Tejas Jerk Chicken Salad. Slightly spicy grilled jerk-spiced chicken (spicy and jerked is redundant) with roma tomatoes, feta cheese, tortilla strips (which I omit), salad and a spicy creamy dressing (which I always have them put on the side).  If the description sounds to spicy for you, then try the Pecan Crusted Chicken Spinach Salad as it is awesome as well. 

Next time you are out on Ray Road or maybe coming back from Holiday shopping at Chandler Mall, stop by and try Z-Tejas. But for full disclosure, their service could be hit or miss. Ok- I've gotta run....I have a craving...."}
{"text":"Decided to bring my mother in law here for a birthday brunch.  It was dreadful! The food was so forgettable it was ridiculous...what a bad choice for such a special occasion.  We sent my mother in laws omlette back and asked for street tacos instead.  They were horrid and of the four we got we left 2.  Never have I been so unwilling to part with $84 as I was at this restaurant.  The one star I have given is for our server Derrick who tried hard to help us have a good experience but it  was  beyond his control.  My family and I  will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Four stars for amazing (but slightly pricey) food, with a bonus star for excellent customer service by manager Brad.  

After a day of yard work, we decided we wanted a great dinner, but didn't feel like getting ready and going out...take out from Z'Tejas it is!  Z'Tejas is one of the few restaurants whose take out food is just as good as their restaurant food.  They pack many of the ingredients separately so that everything is fresh and the correct temperature.  The steak for the steak salad is packed separately, the tortilla strips and cheese are packed separately from the soup.   Even though it costs them more to pack everything, it definitely keeps the integrity and flavor of the food. 

Starter - Bowl of chicken tortilla soup.  The soup has great flavor, but was mostly broth. The chicken that was included was delicious big chunks of white meat.  It came with a side of tortilla strips and cheese (didn't get the typical lime and avocado that usually comes with it - a little disappointing). 

Entree 1 - Diablo Pasta (vegetarian version) - I love they have vegetarian options for many of their popular dishes.  The pasta was wonderfully creamy and spicy! 

Entree 2 - Red Chile Mango Salad - This salad is SOO good.  It has delicious spicy walnuts, tangy blue cheese, tender and tasty grilled steak and mango dressing.  The flavors blend together so perfectly.  This is one of the meals that you crave!  Aside from their chicken artichoke stack (my other fave!), this is usually all I order here.  I just can't go and not experience the perfectly balanced flavor combo.  

This visit - I was actually given the wrong dressing for my salad.  Instead of the wonderfully sweet mango dressing that accents the spicy and tangy ingredients...it was a warm sweet dressing with a heavy red onion flavor.  Not a  good match! :(  
After trying to make due and tough it out I just couldn't do it.  The thing I love about this salad is the way the sweet dressing perfectly complements the other ingredients.  Hubby called them and spoke with manager Brad.  He immediately offered to remake my salad and comp the meal.  I would have been happy with either one (leaning toward re-making the salad as I REALLY wanted to experience the flavors, but didn't want hubby to have to drive back over there).  Comping the meal made up for the extra trip AND I got to enjoy my favorite salad  

This is why Z'Tejas is one of our favorites!!!  Excellent food and EXCELLENT customer service.  We will be back!!!  Thanks Brad!"}
{"text":"We had never been here before and heard the commercials so thought we'd try it. Hostess was a capital \"B\"!! We were sat after 15 minutes by the wait station even though the restaurant was only 1/4 full. 

They had brunch, not what we were interested in. The menu (I assume because of brunch) was very limited. We got the trio chips appetizer which we both liked. Nothing special but good. DH got a draft beer which was flat. I had ice tea it was fine. I ordered the seafood enchiladas, DH the Barbacolla enchiladas. Both were horrible. Tasteless. There was no spice, no heat, bland and gross. Maybe good for our winter visitors. Our waiter was fine. There was a tray of dirty dishes right behind DH the entire time we were there, besides the fact that it was right by the wait station where at least 5 wait staff placed orders there. 

Don't know what the hype is. Won't be returning, I have had better prepackaged frozen dinners."}
{"text":"Excellent tex mex food and drinks!  My friends and I have gone for dinner but truly their happy hour is THE BEST in town!  The chambord margaritas are to die for!! We also eat the smoked chicken enchiladas and the delicious  catfish beignet appetizers! The beignets are very light battered catfish \"fingers\" that are served with a southwestern romoulade sauce ( kinda chipotle flavored). The staff are always warm and friendly and take care to serve you promptly.  Definitely a MUST DO dinng experience."}
{"text":"Very good food, superb bartender, and very tasty margaritas. Great happy hour prices!  First time I was here for lunch with my husband I had the blackin catfish taco. Excellent. And my husband had the z burger n loved it. Sexing time I came with my son for happy hour and we had street tacos. Very good also."}
{"text":"Great Food super service by Thomas - We  were up from Tucson and after shopping at Ikea  - needless to say tired - Thomas gave us great service and chit chatted with us  then  sent us on the ride back to Tucson with best wishes. thanks Thomas"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I am wild for the \"wild mushroom enchiladas\" -- have had them several times and have really enjoyed 'em. The complimentary cornbread and butter is very good, especially when it is served warm. I also love their pecan-crusted chicken spinach salad. The ahi tuna appetizer is a treat.  http://www.ztejas.com/"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whatever you order for eats is sure to be delish! The margaritas are worth the price - more delish! The wait staff has always been helpful, courteous and efficient every time I've dined there.

The ONLY reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is due to the volume inside the restaurant. At times it has been so loud that it's next to impossible to have dinner conversation."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place! Its next to my work which is convenient, but they answer my calls on the first ring, and always provide excellent service and food! Waitresses are very friendly and help me make decisions on what i should order! Their Jerk chicken chowder is MOUTH WATERING! but it is only a special, so i call everyday to see if they have it, and am DYING to have it again. Next time i will order it by the gallon and freeze it im not joking its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service at the bar. But everything at the place aside from the wedge salad is kids meal sized. Total disappointment. The steak burrito 50% tortilla hidden on the bottom in a 3/4 thick pile of tortilla dough, all floating on top of Stouffer's box rice. 

Signature margaritas.... in a doll house maybe, two sips and you hear can I get you another because the thimble sized glass filled to the top with ice has the fluid volume of 1 maybe 2 ounces. 

Just a total rip off for what you get. Still nice ambiance and a manager that really wants you to be happy when you leave. Can't fault the staff, it's the upper management that makes this place a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Really dig this place. The cornbread is addicting and the menu is diverse. Never had a problem here and the service is usually spot-on.

Robert Pfeifer"}
{"text":"Decent food, ok service. Wasn't expecting a whole lot considering I'm from New Mexico so I wasn't let down. Kind of skimpy on the portions. Best part was their famous cornbread, but wasn't the best I ever had. Not on my top list to return.."}
{"text":"Food was great servers were good but the manager was unacceptably rude. I figured after ordering 120$ worth of food in this restaurant. And being the one who payed for it I would have been treated better. Not sure what his name was but he was taller with glasses and a receding hair line. I won't be going back to this place any more. At least not this location."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this by saying I really do like Z'Tejas.  The food is always good, and the service is usually spot on.  The problem I have with this particular location is the hostess(es), and their amazing ability to lose reservations.  On more than one ocassion, I've showed up only to find they have no record of my reservation.  They always look confused and ask me if I was sure I called the right location.  My favorite was when they wanted to know if I put it under the wrong name.  I'm sure I forget my own name all the time.  Awww.....it's ok, hostess(es), at least you're pretty."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I ordered the Voo Doo Tuna and it was awesome. I loved the ginger and sauce with the fish. The veggies were well cooked as well and so was the fish. Thought it would be raw but was lightly cooked. Overall really great. Loved the cornbread as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Z'Tejas to try the famous chambord margaritas and some yummy dinner entrées but were turned away at the door. We walked in the door at 8:45 PM tonight (9/4/16) and were told by the employees at the door that the manager, Tom, had closed the restaurant already. The only problem is that Z'Tejas' website states that they are open until 9:00. Why couldn't we come in to get a quick bite and a quick drink? Also, if the restaurant was closed, why wasn't the door locked to let customers walking in know that the restaurant was closed. Not impressed and very disappointed with the manager at this location and we will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants especially this location. The service is always friendly and fast, the food is always perfect. The margaritas are amazing especially the chambord!! Chicken Diablo pasta, steak and chicken fajitas, and the Z burger are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"I would only give this place one star but the service is good so yeah. Back in the day they had fajitas on the lunch menu, but with that gone the menu sucks! That is all."}
{"text":"Food was yummy, waiter (Kevin) was cute. The chamboro is super super good and not watered down. The hostesses was also super polite and she remembered the friend that I was with. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We love this place. Their Green Pork Chile Nacho's are great and very filling.  Z'Tejas has a survey on your receipt  that will give you a free appetizer with the purchase of one entrée \"if you complete it\".  Due to this, we have not paid the $9 or whatever amount it is for the Nacho's or any appetizer in years!  We just keep going and turning in survey's.  The service is great.  I think the price is kind of high. . maybe by about $2 per entrée, but its good food and the free appetizer offsets the higher price.  Additionally, we've been going there for over 5 years and there's no change in their menu. The menu pretty much stays the same. They have special entree's once in a while, but would like to see new selections added to their menus.  Other than that we've tried almost everything on their menu and its all good. . Great salads too.    Suggestion:  order one salad and split it if your not that hungry. The salads are huge!"}
{"text":"Manager was rude ruined the entire experience for us. The food was good and the waitress was good. Won't bring my family here until they get new management."}
{"text":"My favorite place for brunch in the Chandler/Ahwatukee area! Amazing menu and food! The Mimosa/Bloody Mary bar is so much fun! Cool thing to share, the Brunch menu is available till 3:00pm on the weekend. Sleep in then come here!"}
{"text":"I love this place, friendly staff, food is great, loved the mushroom enchilada, steak salad is always a solid choice and of course the classic jerk chicken salad, appetizers are awesome.  ZTejas has my favorite salsa of any restaurant, wish they would bottle it.  Drinks are awesome.  Fun, upbeat vibe, great location."}
{"text":"The composite YELP reviews of 3.5 stars is about right.  Not great, not bad...just OK.  We went for brunch this morning and here are our thoughts: cornbread was very good, my wife's barbacoa enchiladas were good and my chicken fried chicken & waffles was average.  The fried chicken and waffles at San Tan Brewery is far superior and far more flavorful...so I doubt we'll be back to Z Tejas anytime soon, at least not for that dish."}
{"text":"um, no. Group dinner here was terribly bland. Wine and food disappointed izquierda y deracha. This is the Olive Garden of Phoenix."}

{"text":"I reviewed a couple of reviews from previous individuals.  

This place was great!  I was able to get seated quickly and greeted by my server.  

I asked the server for the his recommended margarita and his choice was on point.  

They brought out corn bread which is one of the best I have ever had and the street tacos were there too.  

My wait period for the tacos was very minimal.  

I would definitely recommend trying this place out.  

Previous reviews said that the guacamole is great so I definitely make another trip to try it out.

{"text":"Chambords margaritas, mushroom enchilada, and cornbread are absolutely amazing. Total recommendation if this is your first time here!"}
{"text":"Everything here was literally just okay. I was meeting a couple girlfriends here for happy hour before a meeting...as usual I was there on time and had to wait for them...I was quickly seated at a patio table and waited for what seemed about 10 minutes for a waiter...browsed their happy hour menu and wanted to go with the hard day margarita. However, the waiter suggested the chambord as it was the most popular...I agreed and it was good but on the smaller side for a margarita.

Went with the street tacos and catfish beignets as appetizers. The food was bland as if nothing was seasoned. 

I would possibly go to a location closer to home for a drink but wouldn't eat there again unless I was maybe trying the entrees and hoping for better."}
{"text":"I have not been here since 2011. Hard to believe yes. However, we came here the other night for a friends Birthday. We came for Happy Hour.
I will start by saying we had the nicest server. This guy was great. He was very attentive and new the menu well.
He even brought out a dessert for my Friends Birthday. She was very happy as they even lit candles in it.
All the drinks we got were on special for HH.We ordered Cat fish Tacos, which are in a soft shell, a little different but, we all liked them. We also got chips and Salsa with Queso.,very good indeed. As well as fried Catfish strips, they were really great.
We had a nice evening and excellent service.
Lots of Parking and restrooms were clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Service wasn't good. Our waitress seem over worked and under extreme pressure. The manager did not address our concerns. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I give them 5 because 1) food (salmon and salad with cornbread) was awesome and 2) GM turned a bad situation in a good one.

i am visiting and am staying at the hotel across the street.  I went there in a recommendation and got there at 6...ordered my food to go with these two girls who are hella young (warning sign).  so i sat and waited, playing my brick break on my blackberry.  I figured they would call me when the food was ready but no one called.

at 630 i got up to see whats going on...those girls in the front were like 'oh whats ur name, whats ur order,' and i believe my order was the only order they took.  they checked by the bar and was like 'oh here is ur order.'  of course i told them,dont you let ppl know their food is ready, and they were like 'oh ok'  idiots.  so i was upset of course and was about to pay when the gm came by and as like ' o my god were u waiting for this all this time?\"  i told him i came in to order and thought the girls will let me know when the order was ready, and didnt know ihad to go to the bar to pay for it, which is way odd.  so he was like hey the food is cold, i will heat it up and just take it, dont pay, its our fault.

so for that i give them a 5 star review from what would have been a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas.  Food is ok. Tonight they tried to serve us old gummy tortilla soup, just nasty. No garnishes, no chicken in it, just brown gummy puréed mush.  They took it back with the irreverence it was served with.  We'll be back for drinks.  Probably not to eat though."}
{"text":"Food excellent.  Service exceptional .  Drinks on Happy Hour great.   Down side the place is generally noisy but the obnoxiously  noisy women behind us made it impossible to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Great staff.  The first time I visited a Z'Tejas, it was at the location in Phoenix for brunch.  I didn't even know there was a location in Chandler.  At night this location has a \"grown and sexy\" like vibe with the dim lighting.  We went to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Love that they have a whole veggie section on the menu, it made choosing my meal so simple.  I had the wild mushroom enchiladas, my friends had the salmon.  The Food was good but the portions are a bit small.  My friends enjoyed their cocktails and the Ancho Fudge Pie was Yum!  Staff is really kind and accommodating.  Love the cornbread!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad if you can get service. Place was not busy or full at 7 on a Saturday night
We were there for 1 hour before they took dinner orders never asked if we wanted appetizer dessert or coffee. Were there for 3 hours and got our dinner after 2 and then they were closing checks took forever and no one even said goodbye or thank you when we left with our large group!
This place will not make it this way"}
{"text":"Came here because it's close to my hotel. Service... great!!! Ate here with a coworker last night and had the crispy salmon entree..., super yummy!!! I highly recommend it!
Decided to come back tonight by myself. Again, fabulous service at the bar! Got the special soup, roasted poblano and corn. It was ok. Ordered the seafood enchilada. I was really hoping for something fabulous, but really disappointed. I love mushrooms, but they overpowered this dish. Needed more seafood. 
Happy hour is great here!!! Love the chamboard margarita!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a baby shower, yes a baby shower! The restaurant staff was awesome and very accommodating. This restaurant in particular had a pretty nice private area where my friend was able to set up pretty nicely. Overall, I think it was great!"}
{"text":"Good good, great service, food was very tasty. You can ask your server to customize your food the way you want and they will do their best. I ordered the sea food enchiladas. Food was good and tasty. Service was quick. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Got seated immediately, friendly staff and food is always AMAZING.  Great service! Delicious chicken chili relleno and steak burro. Melts in your mouth with perfect flavor!"}
{"text":"Ok we have to pay for cornbread, no biggie for a cause. We said ok stop explaining like we are cheap. I mean we both ordered steaks, not apps. But then don't check on us, ask for a second drink. Felt rushed all night and wasn't busy and not closed. Bummed used to be a good experience"}
{"text":"I came here for an easy dinner and margarita during happy hour. I had the most awesome waiter named Chris. He was attentive yet didn't try to push anything onto us, you know like many does. He just rolled with the punches and our constantly changing demands. The food here isn't the awesomest, but the drinks are and the service goes along with that. 

This place gets busy, even though it is huge but they can handle it. I am quite impressed by this. So to recap; Food is OK. Drinks are amazing. Chris is an awesome waiter. I think that summarizes it."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years for Sunday brunch and the Bloody Mary bar, but no more!  boo. When we came today we were told that they only have there house mixes. We tried two of the house mixes, the original and the Horseman. Bleh. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Matt from Virginia with 2 kids was one of the best servers I've ever had. He was considerate and excelled at customer service. The food at Z is excellent. I had the achiote chicken Cobb salad. Its my default meal here. Bloody Mary bar is top notch in this area."}
{"text":"I really love this place, their food is sooo good.  But the service last night was not so good.  It took them 5 minutes to seat us, then another 5 minutes to wait on us by the time we ordered our food we missed happy hour.  We asked the waitress if we could still order off the happy hour menu and she said no.  It took her forever to bring our drinks finally out and then when our appetizer came out we asked about the cornbread, she said she would go get that.Then when we were finished we didn't get our bill in a timely manner either.  Ughhhh!!!!!

Normally the service is really good but in this case it just wasen't.  Really disappointing last night."}
{"text":"I visit this place every time I come to town. The atmosphere is nice, staff is always friendly and I love Happy Hour. Food and their famous Margarita I absolutely love"}
{"text":"In my book, and the collective book that my friends are forced to share with me, Z-Tejas is synonymous with fun. How do you make it a good night? Follow my directions carefully:
1) flag over your waiter or any other waiter (or anyone that looks like a waiter) in your vicinity
2) say the following \"6th street, frozen, salt\"
3) drink
4) repeat

Seriously though, the margaritas are excellent. I haven't tried any other drinks here, but I'm fairly certain they'd be just as good (okay maybe not as good, but close enough).

The food is tasty too. Don't go in expecting authentic Mexican. I don't know why you'd go into a snazzy place called Z-Tejas for authentic food anyway, but that's between you and your brain. The Diablo Chicken Pasta is awesome. The Jerk Chicken Salad is excellent too. I have friends who get the Pork Medallions, and they seem to love it.

If you go and see a large group that's being loud ... look for the devilishly handsome Indian dude and come say hello. Okay I'm kidding, I don't even live in PHX anymore."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the metro-Phoenix area.  Period.  Potent and yummy margaritas (limit = 3 and then you're cut off!) and fabulous discounted appetizers that we usually consider dinner.  If you have room for a real entree, try the relleno.  Heaven!"}
{"text":"This is a great place, amazing atmosphere, awesome people, really great vibe overall. The food was excellent and service was great. We had a server named Derek and he was FANTASTIC. Super personal and helpful guy. Will be coming back because of him."}
{"text":"We just had an excellent experience here.  The food and service from our waiter Oscar was exceptional.  I was so happy to see this restaurant is keeping up with the trend of fantastic customer service and exceptional quality and delicious food and atmosphere.  From the moment I arrived I had a good feeling.  My reservation was made conveniently by calling on the phone; they utilize a text service for our convenience (to notify me out table was ready)."}
{"text":"One word. Cornbread. Several more....

This place was awesome. I'm not one for chains, but I am one for strong drinks, good food, and my awesome friends.

Last night, I met up with friends at Z's. Had a long week at work, so I figured, let's go balls to the wall.

The Vodka Sodas are remarkably strong. Typically at chains, you get a few drops of vodka flavoring. These were NO JOKE. Leave your amateur cards at home.

The ahi tuna appetizer, pulled pork nachos, and the cornbread were enough to change my life, both physically and emotionally. Yeah, that damn good. I won't write about the cornbread, because I want you to try it for yourself....write a Yelp review...and then give me credit. While you are at it, give my friend and fellow Yelper Sarah W. credit as well, because she is the one that turned me on to it.

Want a Mojito that will open your mind to a higher power? Try the Tropical Guava Mojito. Guava rum, X-rated fusion liqueur, monin mojito, mint, lime, soda and sprite. Yeah. 

Like I said....happy hour on a friday was balls to the wall.

Get some. This is the spot. Thank God there is one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The cornbread here is an amazing appetizer. My family and I always come for happy hour and we always enjoy the service. My personal favorite is the smothered chicken burrito. The chicken is very flavorful and I always look forward to going back to get more."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for a business lunch. We made a reservation but they didn't have our seats arranged. Waited an extra 10-15 minutes - fortunately our clients came in a bit later so they didn't wait as long. 

The service was on the slow side. Looking around there weren't that many tables, but still took about an hour to get our main entrees. The table side guac was good but everything else seemed mediocre if not worse. The server got 2/8 orders wrong (I.e forgetting to substitute beans for rice or removing bell peppers). For me, I ordered the crispy salmon and noticed it was raw quarter through the food. Definitely felt the salmon swim upstream afterward. Bleh. 

First time at ztejas, probably last time."}
{"text":"This was an AWFUL Experience. Ordered thru Door Dash.  The fries that came with the burger were RAW. The Baja fish tacos had hardly any mango salsa or slaw. The $7 app was half full! Waste of money. Go somewhere we're they actually care about their food and quality."}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect since we don't have Ztejas in Los Angeles ,  I must say the food AND service was absolutely spectacular.  Although we were a party of 30 people, our servers really took care of us by making sure the chips, salsa and water were being replenished.   

Congrats to Kylie and Blaine for such high customer service standards."}
{"text":"My family made a last minute decision to switch restaurants and head here for dinner. We have family in town and had a party of 9. We were seated right away (awesome!) and had two servers, Tom and Trey. Tom grabbed us drinks right away. Trey seemed a little confused and behind. Tom was on top of refills, boxes and anything we needed. Tom gave us excellent service and was extremely friendly and helpful! Great visit! I would definitely come back and ask for Tom!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a must!!! $5 margarita? Can't beat that. The trio (guac, salsa, queso) was really yummy! Fresh cornbread? To die for! I had the veggie/mushroom enchiladas, what sold me was the MOLE SAUCE. So good! I don't typically order all veggie dishes, but with the portos it was hearty enough...too bad I couldn't substitute ALL Porto's, but I understand as they can be pricey (I did ask). They were SOOO BUSY! Way to be on top of things and have a ton of wait staff to help others, I really like seeing that team work.  Hug parties in the back, and I saw a few managers busting their butt too, congrats. Our server was really great, I think her name was Sara"}
{"text":"We went there for first time, had good food and great service. I liked the variety on the menu, little bit of everything to fit whatever you are in the mood for or can afford,  light to heavy, inexpensive to pricier.  I thought their drink prices were a little high (margaritas were around $8 or more and I thought they should be around $6 for a house marg), but the waiter told us they were still running happy hour, I had a couple of drafts and I was happy with those prices.  We'll go back again for sure, looking forward to it.  And there are lots of places in the valley we would NOT go back to."}
{"text":"Came to this location on a hungry-stomach-only-had-chips-and-coffee-for-breakfast-whim and tried the chicken enchiladas and bow tie pasta jambalaya special. First, you get warm corn bread with real corn kernels in it on a iron skillet and butter. Yummy! The Santa Fe enchiladas came with rice and black beans for $11. Let's just say that I've had better. The jambalaya farfalle has shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, peas, peppers and onions packed with flavor and spiciness for $16. Note to self: never get the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Best staff,  best food, best happy hour!   Never disappointed!  Everyone is friendly and the food and margaritas are amazing!   Sit in th bar and you will be taken care of!"}
{"text":"The best Margarita's ever!!! I love their food, and the service is awesome. Always take out-of-state friends & family here to eat because I've never had less than an awesome experience everytime I eat here!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Whenever I go I always get waiters who are friendly and nice, and the food is excellent as well. No matter what you order you won't be disappointed. The only thing that's bad is the price but there's nothing wrong with spending the right amount for good food, and not to mention that they give you free cornbread as well, which is also excellent by the way"}
{"text":"Went to dinner about 7:00 on a Friday night to relax, share dinner and a margarita.  We were seated in the raised up area to find incredible noise, lots of  kids and loud laughing tables of people.  it is good to enjoy your dinner but it was chaotic, so loud we had to shout to hear each other, not relaxing in the least!  My bread plate was wet and had food on it, and the table next to us was cleared so haphazardly  that a tray of food was left on the chair and the next guest almost sat on it but we warned her.  it will be awhile before I would choose to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and margaritas!  Z'Tejas has one of the best happy hours!  The bartending team is awesome, especially Matt, and one of the reasons we keep coming back to this location. Tip: Ask for the 20th Anniversary Margarita.  Although it's no longer on the menu, they can still make it at this location and it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"They haven't changed the menu in 20 years and the portions are small and the food is not real good. They ought to visit Dick's Hideaway to understand what real good food is. The brunch has a nice atmosphere and the best item on the brunch menu is the coffee."}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday they have an excellent happy hour. It's Monday through Sunday from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. can't beat that. They give you a couple of dollars off of their Margaritas drinks and everything including $3 off of her famous appetizers the table guac is excellent make sure you add your extra salt cuz they don't do it for you the shrimp empanadas with the guacamole and are good and we had two chicken quesadillas which are awesome you have to come and check them out of course we love happy hour Z'Tejas is great for happy hour Monday through Sunday"}
{"text":"After visiting my third or fourth \"Mexican\" restaurant in Chandler, I have come to the conclusion that I have to drive to an actual neighborhood where people of Mexican descent actually live to get good Mexican.  

I think I've had better Mexican in Maine than Arizona so far, it is distressing.  If any of you native Phoenicians (is that how you say it?) out there are reading this review, please drop me a line and PLEASE tell me how to get REAL Mexican food!

Anyhows, this place was very pleasant, I stopped in here late for a drink at the bar, checked their menu and saw the usual American interpretations of Mexican food.  So I can't really rate the food here, but it sure as heck doesn't look like good Mexican to me.

The margarita was their best (shouldn't you get a great one in the Phoenix area?  I think you should) on their drinks menu, made with Cuervo 1800 tequila.  I realized after a few sips that I prefer Sauza Hornitos, but it was passable.

Two inebriated ladies sitting next to us at the bar made the experience more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I had Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno  and I thought I had died and went to heaven!  It was so great.  The waiter was knowledgeable and very helpful.  Food was so great, served hot, great presentation.  I wanted spicy, but the other person I was with wanted mild.  She loved it, and so did I.  This was my first visit, but not my last."}
{"text":"Just like all Z Tejas, this place is great and consistent. Good service and good food in a very comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Best margaritas ever!!! Food isn't bad either. I've been going here for few years and can't ever get enough."}
{"text":"Super bummed with the food here. We used to go here and I don't remember it being this bad. All four of us thought our food was gross even the water tasted like dirt!"}
{"text":"We usually sit in the bar and really appreciate the excellent service by Matt and Phil and the team. We love the sirloin steak  street tacos and the hatch chili queso. My personal favorite are the catfish beignets. Such a light batter on the fish. We always feel welcome and appreciated here. The bar staff service team backs each other up. I like that the proceeds from cornbread  goes to charity since it makes you treasure it even more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is \"fun\". Very open dining room with lots of hustle and bustle as well as noise. Therefore very kid friendly because they could make a lot of noise and no one would really notice. The food they have is very much a Southwest fusion with lots of chile used in their dishes. They even have a very good Ancho chile chocolate cake. Every dish here is delish so just find one that sounds good to you. 


Visited November 2011"}
{"text":"Still one of the best happy hours around! Half price (delicious) appetizers. More to choose from than a bunch of fried appetizers!  My favorites are the Shrimp & Guacamole Bites and the Street Tacos.

Margaritas are always good! Bartenders are super busy but still always friendly, smiling and having a great time. Plus, happy hour is in the entire restaurant, not just the bar area, don't see that much anymore."}
{"text":"We loved the green chile dip they had as a featured appetizer a couple weeks ago. The margaritas are great (the frozen have a lot of tequila but you can't taste it). My bf always gets the steak burrito. I tried the hatch green chile chicken enchiladas and they were awesome! I want to try the Bloody Mary bar next time--they only have that on the weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! It was a great way to celebrate my husband's birthday. We loved the Chili con Queso and Miso Salmon! Shelby was so sweet and helpful with the menu. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Two out of the four of us got the special.  A $26 filet wrapped in jalapeño bacon.  We ordered them med/well and medium doneness.  When they arrived, we were surprised to see one was med/rare and the other was extremely rare.  The waitress offered to take the food back and have it cooked longer.  We respectfully declined.  We didn't feel comfortable sending food back into the kitchen.  Otherwise, the vegetables and potatoes were tasty.  The other meals were fair as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch. The queso and street tacos were amazing.  Good service. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  Delicious food and drinks at reasonably low prices.  They also have great servers that provide excellent customer service.  I was glad we dropped in to visit family and they suggested this place.  I wish there were Z Tejas Grills in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Good after work happy hour!
Great lite lunch selections and always seating at the hi-tops at the bar.
Z' Tejas is a solid standby."}
{"text":"I could not figure out how this chain stays in business considering the quality of their food. I conducted some business research and found out they are privately owned by the same guys who started PF Changs. OK, now I get it. This place is all flash with no substance. I have had better food at roadside taco shops. The owners know their audience; people who go into a place to make a  statement rather than to eat good food. If you are a 30sish wannabe pseudo urban sophisticate, Z'Tejas is for you. If you want to have real Tex-Mex food, you might want to pass on this. Plenty of other options in the Phoenix area that offer better quality and an equal or better dining experience."}
{"text":"On 3/11 we had a perfect brunch at Z'Tejas.  Is this 5-star dining?  Technically no, but everything from drinks to food to service was perfect that Sunday.  I ordered the Eggs Bene Z' Style which has the poached eggs on top of their delicious cornbread with chipotle hollandaise and jalapeno bacon, and a side of breakfast potatoes.  I've got to get over being bashful with my camera because this was a good-looking dish, and tasted even better.  If you're feeling a little adventurous give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  Every aspect of that dish was perfect and I'm still thinking about it.

Mr. M ordered the Hickory Burger and that was another item worthy of a picture.  Cooked medium rare as he ordered it, the smoky flavors were delicious and the sweet potato fries were very good as well.

I can't rave enough about the service.  We had a couple of the $4 mimosas and then for dessert shared a ginger something something martini.    We sat in the bar area and were greeted immediately with an explanation of the bloody mary/mimosa bar options.  The bartender brought us the champagne, and then we added our choice of juice.  The mango juice is a phenomenal choice.

When it came time for the ginger something something martini, we said we were going to share it.  The bartender was so funny and said he didn't want any fighting over the drink, so he made it with 2 glasses and we each got a healthy pour of about 2/3rds the glass.  That drink was one to savor, with I think crystallized ginger on the rim.  Delicious!  Two bartenders took care of us and I wish I would have caught their names because they were prompt, friendly, and funny.  5-stars all the way.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at T'ejas for Lunch. Service is very attentive.  Food is great as always. The corn bread was extra special this day. Yumo. I had the chicken artichoke stack (which I always get) and Tea. $14 lunch plus tip.

However I was disappointed with T'ejas not having \"lunch size portions\" they had a lunch menu that is the same as the dinner menu but without the steaks and a few other items. They also monthly features on a separate printed piece but I thought was a bit pricey for lunch. (Sorry Z) I was looking for  something lighter and smaller for lunch. Of course I only ate half,  but could not take with me because I had no where to store until I returned home.  I assure everyone it was good.

I will return for happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken tortilla soup and corn bread. 
Great indoor or outdoor seating. 
Many times I have called in for take out food there for dinner parties and have never been disappointed. The food holds great in chaffing dishes and the corn bread is terrific for dinner parties. Cut it into four pieces and place in a linen covered bowl to keep warm and moist. Reheats fabulously."}
{"text":"katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip.

let me start off by saying we were seriously starving, i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad. we walk in and theres a 'bloody mary bar' and it looked absolutely disgusting. i alsmot lost my appetite by being greeted by that filthy mess of a germ bar. 

 i sat down while katie used the restroom and i ordered us water and myself a drink. 

katie and i sat talking for a bit and i asked,
\"are you going to get a drink?\"
\"ya, if he ever comes back\" was her response

then i realized it had been 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. finally, he came around and tried to make us order chips. we were so hungry we almost did but passed them up. we ordered our food, it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad, instead i opted for a breakfast dish. and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point. 

another 15 or so minutes go by and we can't take it so we order chips. 

then we notice everyone around us is eating corn bread. HEY WHERE'S OUR CORNBREAD?!?! we don't need chips and salsa, we're supposed to get cornbread! 

so our waiter passes by us again so we ask/shout for cornbread.

then, not even lying, our food, chips and salsa, and cornbread come to the table all at once. so overwhelming

the chips and salsa were not good. 
my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada.

if you eat here, stick to the jerk chicken salad(one of the best salads ive ever had) or the spicy chicken pasta which is perfectly spicy.

2 stars for service
2 stars for food on this trip(usually i would give it 4)
2 stars for sunday morning ambiance(dinner is the time to go here)"}
{"text":"Zteja's consistently delivers good food. I frequent the Chandler location for lunch because it's near my office. \"Satisfied\" is the feeling I walk away with every time.... Not ecstatic, not disappointed.   I particularly like that they've updated their menu to include vegetarian and gluten-free sections.  They've always offered these selections, but you had to pick through it and remove meat... but get charged for it!  The new menu allows you to get regular items without meat at a reduced price... me likely ;-).  

My favorites are the Ancho Chopped Salad (Minus the meat and bacon) and the mushroom enchiladas.   Their chips and salsa are okay, but not really worth paying the $4 for.  I would recommend holding off for the corn bread... hint, hint... they don't bring it out until you order, it kills their ability to up-sale! 

I definitely recommend Zteja's for lunch, its good food with quick service (45min out the door).  My actual rating is 3.5, but that's not an option."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is great, the service even better and the food is fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced.  My husband and I went on a Sunday afternoon and they had a martini bar.  Loved it!  I had the under 550 calorie fish with pesto and cilantro. It seriously tasted like way more calories.  I totally recommend this to anyone who likes fresh dishes, good service and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"The waitress fucked up my order and made me pay for it. Even after admitting she brought out something that I didn't order. Then she charged me for it. She said even if it's her mistake they make you pay for it and to just \"take it out of my tip\". Nahhh fam never going there again. Oh btw don't order the sea food enchilada. It sucked."}
{"text":"The restaurant has really changed since our last visit a year ago. We went for happy hour on Friday afternoon. The outdoor sitting tables we filthy and cluttered. The restaurant no longer has an upscale ambiance like it used to. We had the catfish bignets which were good but not a good value for happy hour. I'd rather make the drive up to Scottsdale for a better experience."}
{"text":"After about a year of the guys at work insisting that I go, I finally went.
 
Foremost, our waitress was really nice. A great waiter/waitress can usually make or break a restaurant experience. She did a great job taking care of us. Although the sun was shinning in my eyes half of the time, the environment was still pleasant. The music was just loud enough to hear but not so loud to have to talk over it and the dining area was roomy. The food wasn't the best food I've ever tasted but it was still worth the experience.
 
Cornbread - Amazing. You'll find little pieces of corn while you eat. It's literally corn and breading. It's the way cornbread should be.
Bottomless basket of chips and three salsas - The chips were pretty good and while the salsas had a lot of flavor to offer my mouth they just weren't as great as I was hoping.
Wild mushroom enchiladas - Delicious and different but it could have been served a little hotter. Not spicier, hotter as in heat.
Baked seafood enchiladas - My boyfriend's entrée. He enjoyed it and was most thrilled about the barbequed shrimp the enchiladas contained.
Tropical Guava Mojito - Very sweet but still sooo good.
Stoli Blueberi Cosmo - Amazing. I could go back just for the Stoli Blueberi Cosmos and cornbread and leave happy. Best drink of the evening.
Prairie Berry Lemonade - Kamikaze in disguise. If you don't like fruit pulp I don't recommend this. There is lemon pulp in this drink. It's served with floating blueberries also. I loved it.
 
Do I plan to go back? Very likely. If not for the food, definitely for the cornbread and drinks."}
{"text":"it was, okay. the food was not spicy, not flavorful and not a full portion. the happy hour margarita was more mix than tequila. the best thing I can say is the food was quick to the table. we didn't get a refill on water or cockle or hot tea."}
{"text":"I really love the happy hour. Living in Chicago we don't have the best happy hours the drinks were decent the cornbread was delicious and I really enjoyed the fish tacos. It is really packed at happy hour but other than that I would definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped for the Bloody Mary bar and brunch. Have never seen anything  like it. They give you the vodka, Titos, and a glass of ice. The rest is up to your mixing. On the bar they have a wide variety of additives and several mixes. Unbelievable.  Cost is only $5. It's a real bargain. If you don't like Bloodies they have Mimosas and margaritas. For brunch I had the Eggs Benedict made with real honestly made hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Z'Tejas in years.  So when a date asked if I wanted to meet there, I thought what a great idea, now I'll totally have something to Yelp about!

We met at 6 pm on a Saturday night, and while clearly busy, it only took them 10 minutes to seat us.  The restaurant was nicely laid out, plenty of room between tables, and I didn't feel like I was crammed in a corner.  The noise level was perfect too, something that is missing from so many places.

Our server was friendly and quick, and answered menu questions with suggestions and good information. I ended up ordering the 5 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese, and my date got the El Diablo chicken.  Both were pasta dishes, but very different.  The mac & cheese was gooey and tasty, and very filling - no appetizer and I could not finish my plate.  I really wanted to - the bacon on the top was the perfect touch.  My date's chicken and pasta was spicy, but not overwhelming - subtle flavors playing out nicely together. 

The portions were large enough that I couldn't even think about dessert, and was so glad we passed on an appetizer.  Overall it was a great meal, and I would have given them 5 stars, if it wasn't a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Overall. 3 stars.. The food was ok. I expected the salsa to taste better. Umm let's see our waiter was ok. He seemed to be a little off, and was forgetful. Maybe it was a busy day. But they didn't have anymore banana muffins. Luckily they threw in cornbread for free. We had to ask a few times for chips and salsa. But would I come back. Maybe"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  GOOD drinks.  Yeah, I had a lot of margarita's that night.  The food was good too.  I had this scallop appetizer which was incredible.  I guess it better be since it was like an $18 appetizer!!  LMAO  Hey, it was someone else's dime so I don't give a crap.  I don't like that vendor too much anyway."}
{"text":"First, let's get this out of the way. Detracting from giving this place a five star was the fact that on weekend nights it's extremely busy, noisy, and crowded in here!  You can barely hear yourself think, let alone the other person talk. 

No, on with the good stuff. Even though we arrived slightly before happy hour but were seated after happy hour the server was nice enough to give us our margaritas at happy hour price!  Good service!  The skillet cornbread that they brought out as an appetizer was simply fantastic. I shared a combination of street tacos and cat fish tacos with the person that I was with. The cat fish tacos were some of the best that I've ever had and the flavor was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This spot has some big pluses and some bigger minuses. 
On the plus side - the food quality is decent. Environment is cool The flavor of the steak street tacos was pretty good too. Server was pleasant but not trained to ensure customers concerns are addressed. 

On the negative - EVERYTHING has chipotle flavor. Even Chipotles restaurant doesn't have this much Chipotle flavoring. I do not like the smoky flavor of chipotle. My husband doesn't mind it but this was even too much for him. 

Guac - chipotle Tabasco (luckily we asked for no Tabasco so the guac wasn't ruined)

SW Caesar - Chipotle dressing. It wasn't listed as having it. We probably took 3 bites between us of the salad. Wasted $$. We did mention to the waiter that it was Chipotle dressing (which I'd previously told him I don't like so to keep anything Chipotle off the food). He said \"Oh really?\"  Didn't offer to replace or refund it either. 

Street Tacos: asked for no chipotle sauce but it came with it anyway. 

On a previous visit:
Shrimp and Guac Tostada bites. Asked for no Chipotle sauce but it came with it still on it. 

Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad- husband says it was great. No idea if it had chipotle sauce. If not - it's a minor miracle. 

Seriously!! ENOUGH with chipotle mayo on every dang thing you serve. Diversify your flavors please. After 2 visits, we are done. Tired of paying for food we won't eat. (We didn't ask for items to be replaced. The first visit I was with clients and didn't want to fuss. Second visit I scraped it off the tacos because my husband was hungry and the waiter wasn't around. Second visit part 2 (the SW salad) I told the waiter and he shrugged it off,saying \"Its a Smoky flavor but not chipotle\". Chipotle IS smoky. Argh. 

Could easily be a 4 star if they made orders right and tried other sauces on their food. 

OH! The salsa is chipotle too."}
{"text":"This southwestern themed restaurant has its appeals.  So I expected Mexican food with an American twist.  Most places that serve bread when your meal.  But Z'Tejas goes above and beyound and delivers cornbread.  I would have to say this is the best part of my meal.  There are even corn pieces in the piping hot bread in the cute iron pan.  It's fluffy and warm and the perfect way to start of the meal.  I almost got full just by eating the cornbread before my food came out.

I went during lunchtime and ordered the shrimp papaya enchiladas.  Shrimp, papaya, celery, onion and spices are wrapped in soft corn tortillas.  A black bean sauce covered the enchilada.  The meal also came with a corn rice and salad.  I barely tasted the papaya, but the shrimp turned out very well.  It was soft, but not chewy.  The black bean sauce was a bit dry and hardened the enchilada. There were vegetables added on top of the enchildas, but the bell peppers seemed too soggy and bland.  I believe the additional vegetables were superfluous and didn't add to the value of the dish. The salad was not special, but adding corn to the rice was a unique way to serve it.  It blended well with the cornbread that was served throughout the meal. 


They do have a variety of food selections on the Happy Hour menu.  I think I'll go back and try some of the other dishes.  And mainly I would go back just for the cornbread alone.  :-) Overall, the food is average, what I typically expect from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I only want to write a review to give Phil, the bartender a shout out. He is awesome and always on top of his game! Other than that, Ztejas is amazing. I have loved everything on the menu! Great chicken, burgers, pasta, tacos, salad, and burritos!"}
{"text":"Great food with friendly service.  This location is close to my office so I end up having a lot of client/vendor lunches here.  The food is great and the prices are right.  The menu offers lots of choices for everyone."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Ahwatukee for Happy Hour.  $5.00 appetizers and $1.00 off chambord margaritas.  But only have 2, they are strong.  And the pulled pork nachos are out of this world.  It is very hard to eat that appetizer by yourself, unless you are me.  Give it a try.  Keegan is a great bartender also."}
{"text":"Joey did a great job in the bar. He was handling the whole bar by himself withe ease. The environment was warm and welcoming. Couldn't hear music very well. Food was good quality and reasonably priced. We will return!"}
{"text":"I used to have not great experiences here but it has recently got better. The service is amazing now. Waiters are all very friendly and food usual comes out in a reasonable time. The food is pretty good as well although it varies depending on the dish. The tacos are amazing but some of the pasta dishes have an odd flavor to them. Overall its a very good place though."}
{"text":"We heard today from my son who wife and he dined at the resturant Sat. evening about 7:30 pm. Work all day and get a chance to go out to sit down once or so a month and come away with less than expected dining.experience. We watched the kids to give them a chance to relax. 
I asked if the resturant was busy and he says it didn't appear to be. The problem is the Fajitas which come, as he says on a platter with the fixings and a separte hot plate with the meat on one end. The meat wasn't hot and sizzling like it is suppose to be but luke warm. He should have sent it back but they were too hungry at that hour and just wanted to eat. I find fault with the server as this stuff should be put up to serve hot and if left on the bank to be picked up too long it isn't the kitchens fault. Like I said, he said it wasn't busy so the server must have been busy doing social things. maybe posting or catching up. But no reason to serve a dish on a cast iron plate if it isn't searing hot. 
Don't get me wrong here as I have good reports from my wife who she and friends love  Zs.. i have never been there and i like my food served HOT. Zs just lucky it was my son and not me as you got a pass this time and a pass ain't that greeat. ."}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's one of mine and my husband's go to places for a quick, easy bite. Love the street tacos and 7th street margarita. Service has been great in my experience. We usually go early to avoid a wait. 

Atmosphere is enjoyable and their Sunday mimosa bar is fun!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago for brunch. I will say that I am still a fan of Z Tejas but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. I had the potato hash and eggs which was ok but it seemed like it needed something more flavor wise. Maybe a little more sauce on top would have made it better. Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious and refreshing. My companion said that she loved her burger and fries. I still love Z Tejas but I will probably just go for dinner there from here on out since that is where they really shine."}
{"text":"Queso was THICK, tasted like velveta, and cost 8.50. Street tacos very bland. Used to Street tacos having se spice, or flavor. Boo! Drinks were good."}
{"text":"I had some of the best Ahi tuna I have experience in a long time. Rare actually did mean rare, I am glad to see that their cooks have been trained in the are of tuna searing. 

The tamari tuna is basically a sesame crusted seared tuna on a bed of rice and veggies with a great Chile sauce, think of it as an upscale jap-mex fusion.  The tuna itself was of a very high grade, sliced thinly and a dark ruby red. It was tender and lacked the sinuous bits cheaper ahi can have. The flavor was fresh and well accompanied by the tamari crusted sesame seeds. 

I also had a small salad with their sesamee ginger dressing, which is so good that  I would order in cocktails if it were not frowned upon. 

There was also a copious amount of corn bread so I could get my south western starch fix."}
{"text":"Go there for happy hour, chambord margs and green chile pork verde, all there appetizers are dope!"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner. Love the diablo pasta and fajitas. They have a serious selection of tequilas, the staff are friendly (if preferential toward 'locals'). Good location too- nice area down on Ray. I try to make it over when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jerk chicken salad is to die for!  And the Chambord margaritas are delicious! Great service!"}
{"text":"Great service on the patio. Came for Happy Hour but tequila Tuesday even better! This place is getting hard to find..."}
{"text":"Oh Z, how do I love thee.  Let me count the ways.

1. LOVE your margaritas.  Seriously.  I'm not a fan of tequila and/or margaritas generally speaking, but I love Z's margaritas.  Especially the Chambord and Prickly Pear.   Be warned though - they're VERY dangerous.

2. SALSA!  I love it!  They also have an appetizer with a variety of 3 salsas, but honestly, their original is the best.  The chips are good too - light and crispy.

3. EVERYTHING on the menu.  Not kidding.  I haven't had anything I didn't like at Z.  My faves include: catfish tacos, Jerk Chicken salad, Diablo Pasta, Wild Mushroom enchiladas, Mac & Cheese w/o bacon, the trout, seriously, the list could go on and on.

My mouth is watering.  I think you get the point.  Go to Z.  ASAP."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, and fabulous ambiance. Drinks were great and  management did an amazing job catering to our super picky little one!"}
{"text":"We went to Z Tejas for dinner Saturday night after cocktails at the sandbar. We should've eaten at sandbar!! We don't live close to a tejas so we don't frequent the joint-- but we've had brunch several times and we're pleased. This dinner was low scale. It was like Olive Garden -- clearly pre-made and flavorless. I had chicken stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and se bland sauce And my hubby had the paper thin ribeye with bland sauce. The vegetables and potatoes looked the same on every plate (pet peeve). Boooo! Service was decent... That's why you got two stars. We won't return!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. We came in at 9:40 and the rest of our party came in at 9:54 to find that the kitchen is closed, despite the fact that the restaurant doesn't close until 10. They were extremely un polite about it and it was blatantly obvious that they were angry. As I work in a restaurant I know that although it might be inconvenient to have customers in so close to closing, it is their JOB to serve us. We had just finished my sisters high school graduation ceremony only to be greeted with rude service. Extremely disappointed, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary and mimosa bar are awesome."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and decided to try Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill for lunch and were super glad we did as it was an excellent meal!

Ambiance & Decor. 
- Very nicely decorated in, naturally, a Southwestern style. Although it is a fairly large room and was getting fairly busy by the time we left, it was not noisy at all. Very nice!

Food. 
- The buttermilk corn bread is superb! Served in a small skillet with a side of butter it is airy and really, really good. As yummy as it is though, I do wish they would offer a jalapeño or green chili version. 

- Based on our waitresses recommendation, I had the Diablo Pasta (spinach & red pepper linguine, spicy cream sauce, Cotija cheese, and jalapeños) - and I had to agree with her it was VERY good - and VERY rich. 

- The better 1/2's Five-cheese Macaroni & Achiote Chicken (Jack, cheddar, Parmesan, Romano & bleu cheese, bacon gratin) was also delicious - and also pretty decadent.

Service.
 - We got off to a bit of slow start when the hostess tried to sit us right next to the service area where at least 10 staff members were conducing business, but our request for a quieter table was readily & happily agreed to (but we should not have had to ask as it was not busy at when we got there). Our server while very friendly, and knowledgeable could have been a bit more attentive. A manager walked by to check on things - which I always take as a good sign!!

We are already looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Four stars for delicious margaritas and cornbread.
I wasn't a fan of the mexican food here, to be honest.  I did enjoy the pork tenderloin stuffed with sausage though!"}
{"text":"I had not been to a Z'Tejas in about 15 years. I was a little surprised that they no longer provide the complimentary cornbread with meals. You can still order it and pay for it (the proceeds go to charity). Instead they bring some thick, cold corn chips with a brown sauce (tastes like a smoked chipolte pureed sauce, not a chunky, fresh Mexican food salsa). My friend and I tried it are not fans of the flavor profile. In the future I need to remember to ask them to not bother bringing this stuff to the table.

I had grilled ruby trout salad with seasoned walnuts, a small blob of feta cheese, mixed greens, and a flavorful dressing. The trout was very good and the overall salad was excellent. The price was $14 which I thought was about twice what it was worth. My friend had the mushroom enchiladas and stated that they were very good ($10).

Service was very good and the food arrived in a timely manner. There are both tables and booths and the noise level is not too bad (normal conversation can be carried on). The restaurant looked clean. It was a pretty typical look and feel for this chain.

Parking is plentiful and the disabled parking is close to the door for the mobility impaired."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night with the wifey and was very pleased with our service and the food! The corn bread is delicious! And our meals were both really good!"}
{"text":"Only get date night every six months...don't come here!!  Ordered, no wait, tried to order a margarita on the rocks. HARD sell by both bartenders to have the frozen, it's a heavier \"pour\" they shared.  Told them I can't take a frozen drink, oh this will be different.  Welcome to the land of margarita ICEE services .  Sorry you are not a bartender.  Boyfriend asked for a hurricane, met with the response \"I can put something together for you\" but I think you'll really like the frozen\" says the ICEE server.  Complete disappointment..."}
{"text":"I was exploring random restaurants and found this awesome South Western restaurant.  I ordered 2 Dos XX beers and ordered seasonal Chile Shrimp dish and Mushroom Onion quesadilla appetizers beforehand togo. Both were well cooked and delicious. I hope they keep seasonal shrimp meal as it was spicy but not hot. This place is priced a bit higher but food/beer is high quality. I am impressed and recommend Z'Tejas!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this place before. My boyfriend recommended the margaritas as some of the best in town. So I said let's give it a go. When we walked in, there was no wait and were seated right away. The service was a bit slow at times but our waitress was very pleasant. We tried two different margaritas each and they were all pretty tasty.

As for the food, the chips and salsa were unimpressive for being house made salsas and I wish that they only carried the blue corn tortilla chips (unfortunately there were only 3 in the entire bowl...). The cornbread that they serve was surprisingly delicious. I'm very familiar and very particular with my southern styled food. And this cornbread did not even need the butter that they brought out.

As for the main dishes, he ordered the mushroom enchiladas and I the santa fe chicken enchiladas. He said his was good being paired with sauteed vegetables and black beans. I believed him due to the fact that he did not leave much on his plate! :) As for mine, it was okay. The green chile rice they served alongside the enchiladas was not good at all but the vegetables were okay. The chicken itself was flavorful and had an okay spice level. But the 'bbq' they place ontop in the form of a \"Z\" kind of threw it off.

Overall, it was decent for the price point and the margaritas were pretty tasty. So I cannot think why I would not be back. However, I cannot think this would be my first choice for anything besides good margaritas."}
{"text":"Always loved this place. Especially the corn bread which is the best you can get in town. Get nacho chips with three dip salsa and gauc for appetizers. 

Recently had the Fish Tacos and it tasted amazing with pieces of mango and tomato.

For desert: Ancho chili Fudge just makes me dreamy.

If you wanna take a girl to a place with good food and great ambiance this is your spot."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, on the recommendation of my parents. I have never been to a ztejas with the exception of some catered breakfast meetings. 

I really enjoyed their chambord margaritas, which were on happy hour special. The table side guacamole was ok, not the best that I have had. Everyone was happy with their main dishes, which vary from Mexican, or tex-mex inspired. 

The service was ok, my parents commented that they have had some pretty awesome servers at this location, however our server seemed a little overwhelmed, she would run to the table, as us one thing, leave and come back and ask again. It took my dad three attempts to order a beer. 

I give 3 stars because the service was average and the food was good! I'll give it another try in the future though."}
{"text":"I was seated and waited more than 5 minutes while others around me who arrived after me were taken care of. I was about to leave when my waiter Tom came up and saved the restaurant from getting a one star. He sincerely apologized about my wait and made my meal enjoyable.  I had the chicken enchiladas which were very good.  Suggestion to management, train to host staff to realize a customer hasn't been taken care of in a short period of time. The hostess past me several times and it didn't register there was a problem."}
{"text":"OK...so it's been 5 years.  I don't come here often, obviously!  We had a company lunch on this occasion.

The place was pretty full, and very loud.  Surprising how loud.

I ordered the steak burrito.  When it arrived it wasn't very hot.  Our orders were called in ahead of time, and we arrived punctually.  There were probably 15 of us, and they had the orders ready almost instantly.  Given the temperature I would say they cooked it well ahead.  My burrito must have been sitting around for (I would guess) 30 minutes to get that not-warm.

So how did it taste?  The flavor was not bad.  Pretty good, really.  The rice that came with it was seasoned very well, I thought.  But the steak in the burrito was a bit fatty and gristle-y.  I expect better quality meat at Chipotle or Cafe Rio, and I certainly expect better here!

All I can say is I'm glad I didn't pay the $13.50 for that burrito.  Yes, that's how much the lunch menu steak burrito cost!  If it was $7 I probably would bump to three stars.  Flavor was good, and temperature would probably have been fine if it wasn't a pre-order for a large group.  So I'll give them those.  Well, at least the benefit of the doubt on the temperature.  But the fat and gristle, plus the portion size (which was small) do not warrant a $13.50 price tag!  At that price the value just isn't there for what you get.

Service was good, especially considering the size of our group.

If there ever is a next time I will have to try something completely different.  For a burrito I could get one at Chipotle for $9 that is twice the size and almost as flavorful."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great ambience. 

Went for lunch with coworkers and then went to their happy hour. Amazing deal on delicious cocktails. I loved their Skinny Cucumber Mules. Their appetizers were amazing! We got the seared ahi, dumplings, street tacos, spinach quesadillas, and these chips with shrimp on top of them. 

I am definitely going back to try their main entrees."}
{"text":"A decent southwest meal from a chain.  Kind of reminded me of a little more upscale Chili's.  Not bad, but also not great either.

The margaritas just didn't have the right sour mix. A basic margarita should have a good balance but this was just all sour and too bitter.

The trio of dips had very good queso, decent guacamole, and fair salsa.  The chips were plentiful though.

As for the main course, I had the salmon and it was utterly forgettable. Perhaps I should know better than to order fresh fish when you're not near the ocean, but it was just disappointing.  

Overall, though, a solid choice for friends to get together."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing for southwestern comfort food. Free buttery corn bread, then I ordered the guacamole, which they made table side, and then I had a fajita meal. It was delicious. Decently priced and large portions (I had plenty of leftovers)"}
{"text":"Have been here twice within  4 days.  Both times were excellent.

On Sunday hubby and I took friends there for brunch, and we were delighted.  I ordered the Barbacoa enchiladas, and the dish was very, very good.  Everyone at the table truly enjoyed their meal, and we had excellent service.

Today I dined here with a friend and the Asian dumplings -- delicious.  Even though this dish is listed in the appetizer section it made an excellent meal for me."}
{"text":"Good not great.  The wife and I came for a bite at happy hour.  We sat on the patio, which was more quiet than I'd have expected based on proximity to the road.   The margarita's were really good but not the best in the area, which may keep us from going back.  Chips and queso were really solid and so was the quesadilla.  Happy hour pricing wasn't bad but wasn't great either. 

TLDR - Good spot but probably not the best in the area for what we are looking for.  Definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot when you want something more than the standard soup, sandwich, salad.  I ordered some chicken medallion / side of potatoes dish and it was really good.  The queso dip was also good, too."}
{"text":"Cornbread!!! Complimentary cornbread after your order. I love their margarita flight, the best is the 6th Street. It's a good place for lunch and one of the best places for happy hour"}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently gotten new owners. A few things have changed but the food is still delicious as ever. For example, they used to give out cornbread as part of the meal. Now it is $3, which is donated to charity. I think the reason they did it this way is because no one is going to throw a fit over money going to a charity. But I'm sure they will eventually just start charging for it without donating. Basically, they are cutting down costs but doing it in a \"nice\" way. Other than that, I always love the atmosphere, and there isn't an item on the menu that I don't like. The waiters and waitresses are usually very nice and attending. Even when the place is busy, the food comes out pretty quick. The prices are to be as expected for a nicer restaurant. If you're looking for a unique southwestern dining experience, Z-Tejas is the place!"}
{"text":"I love going to z'Tejas. The place is always nice and friendly. The margaritas are great and I love the cornbread! My favorite dish is the gorganzola New York strip. Nothing like a sprinkle of cheese on your steak! I also enjoy the tomato basil dressing but will pass on those weird things they call croutons..."}
{"text":"This was better than I expected.  We got there for an early dinner so they still had happy hour going on.  Happy hour is until 7 pm.  We ordered the guacamole made fresh at the table side.  This was very good but no spice even with the diced Jalapeños.  Tammy was our server and she is timely, efficient, polite, attentive, and knowledgeable of the food and drink menu. She is able to make recommendations.  I had the veggies instead of chips for the guacamole.  You can make a meal of that alone.  Fresh, cucumbers, celery and carrots.  The manager came out shortly after the first bowl of veggies and said they didn't peel them and replaced them before we even had a chance to notice.  They even pull the threads off the celery like I do.  (I thought I was the only one) we had the special.  A chicken pot pie with Cajun and green chili cream sauce.  They precooked the chunks of potato before baking them in the pie.  The Zucchini, carrots and other veggies were still crispy like I like.  We ordered a side of cornbread that must have an extra cup of sugar in it with corn kernels.  They do NOT offer a veteran's discount."}
{"text":"So one of our favorite little spots.  Great service as usual.  A little disappointed to see they now charge for cornbread.  Used to be free.

They allowed me to order my Diablo pasta even though it wasn't on the lunch/brunch menu which was awesome.  I tried it with shrimp this time.  Couldhave used a few more shrimp (had maybe 5) and more spice, but overall very good.

My GF had the steak burrito.  She gives it a solid C.  Sauce a little salty and the burrito is drenched in sauce and cheese.  Not a traditional burrito.  The steak inside was flavorful and rice and black beans were good.  She said she wouldn't order it again though.

Our server was awesome!  Super friendly and prompt.  Gave good reccommedations.  Very happy with the service."}
{"text":"Nice location and friendly service. Ally was our waitress and we could have not asked for anyone better. She really made the experience that much better. Ally came to check on us often not too much and not too little. She was quick at taking our orders and getting them right the first time(i know it also involves the cook). We started with a trio appetizer, and the guacamole was lacking seasonings, the red salsa was good with a perfect spice to it, and the Chile con queso was not impressive. My mom and I had tacos she had carne asada and I had shrimp. The proteins were really tasty and seasoned just right, but the tortillas were hard on the edges and cold. That part was unappetizing so I ended up eating two of my tacos with no tortilla which is crummy because I ordered tacos. They also brought out cornbread and that cornbread was delicious I could have ate 10 of those, but of course didn't. For sides my mom had rice and it was okay not the best a little dry. I had black beans and the Z salad. Beans were good again a little something was missing. Now the salad was delicious! It was fresh, colorful and it was refreshing eating it.
For drinks we had a tea and a lemonade the lemonade did not taste homemade, but I really enjoyed I had about 2 cups of it and that's unlike me. I tend to just drink water with my meals.

The restaurant was clean, staff was amazing, but the food was not so great considering there pricing I expected more. I think I would be willing to go back just because of the staff, but we will see."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner here last night. The parking lot was PACKED so we were expecting a wait, but when we got in there was a normal crowd and no wait. Surely all those people weren't at Fleming's?

FOOD:
The chips with three salsas appetizer was ok, but kind of pointless. They bring you a skillet of cornbread automatically, so paying for chips and average salsa is kind of a waste.

We both ordered the steak, which had a very tasty chipotle cream sauce on top. Included were garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed seasonal vegetables. In our case, this meant zucchini and carrots.

The steak was cooked well, exactly as ordered and was a good cut. I had originally eyed the chile relleno until I noticed that it was stuff with, among other things, raisins and apricots. No thanks.

They have a really good brunch that I've been to as well, with a \"Bloody Mary Bar\" where you get the liquor and the glass and get to choose your mixer, veggies, etc."}
{"text":"Awful.  Just awful.

I've been to Z'Tejas 5-10x in southern California.  This was my 1st experience at this particular one in Arizona.

We came on 12/23 with a decent size party, about 10 with a few kids.  Waiter was not nice or friendly, not in the Xmas spirit let's say, but that didn't really annoy me too much.  We had a male and female waiter, I won't use their names as I don't want anyone to get in trouble/lose a job/or whatever, and they got multiple orders wrong, despite being corrected during the ordering process.  Example, kids meal, chicken strips with sweet potato fries.  
Waiter: \"ok, cheeseburger with fries?\"
\"No, chicken strips with sweet potato fries\"
\"OK\"

15 minutes later, cheeseburger with regular fries show up.
This happened with quite a few dishes.

Then he disappeared for the remainder of the meal.  I think he really hated our table because he kept getting stuff wrong and we continually sent stuff back (black stuff floating in milk, wrong orders, etc.).  He served other tables around us, but not ours.  Maybe he was overworked and had a bunch of other tables, but whatever.

Waitress wasn't much better, but still made errors.

Now, the food.  Like I've said before, I've been to Z'Tejas multiple times.  The food here was so bad.

Steak burrito on rice.  Steak was good, rice was horrible, needed to be cooked at least another 10 minutes.  Overall best thing that we ate.

Chicken salad.  Just awful.  horrible presentation, dry chicken, probably the wrong dressing was brought out, etc.  No redeeming qualities here.  Go to mcdonalds and get a better salad or just go to your trashcan and get a better salad.

Chicken Fingers Kids meal.  Worst chicken fingers I've ever had in my life.  How do you screw up chicken fingers?  It was like eating chicken flavored chalk.  Overcooked, under seasoned.

Tostada appetizer or whatever it was, undercooked shrimp aka grey shrimp, had to send it back.

Congratulations Z'Tejas, you found food I wouldn't eat for free."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents as we were visiting my grandmother nearby.  The service was some of the best we have ever experienced and the food was amazing too.  My parents and I started with the cornbread which was hot, fresh, and delicious.  For our entrees we shared three things which were all wonderful.  The trout salad had delicious and crispy red trout on top of a delicious salad which had spicy walnuts in them.  We also had both the seafood and mushroom enchilada that were even better!  We don't eat shellfish out, and they were more than willing to take out the small amount of shellfish in it.  

My parents also told the waiter it was my birthday coming up and they gave us a complimentary Ancho Fudge Pie with a birthday candle on top.  It was one of the most delicious deserts we ever had and seemed like a perfect cross between a lava cake and brownie.  Plus there is a PokeStop on the premises and as we were about ready to leave, I caught a Pikachu that I renamed Z'Tejachu.  After posting my experience on Facebook and sharing it with others, friends who have lived in the Phoenix and Austin areas also raved about their wonderful experiences at Z'Tejas."}
{"text":"I have an allergy to chipotle, usually I steer clear of Mexican food but my family wanted to eat here. I expressed my concerns of chipotle to our waitress Stacie and she suggested a meal and let the kitchen know about my allergy. The food was AMAZING! And the manager even came over to reassure me that my meal was being well prepared. Such a great friendly staff!! I have never been to a restaurant where they cared so much that I had a good experience. Definitely 5 stars from us!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Primarily A Staff Review after Addressing our Dining Visit
In all fairness, one star less only due to the seriousness of addressing quality control.

Passing through this area of AZ, we had an impromptu lunch catching up with friends here, as they selected the venue based on a previous enjoyable dining experience. Really open dining area, bright, upbeat, and with attentive service. My experience here, I admit, can NOT be about the food per say. Hospitality in Arizona is very consistently positive. Despite our unfortunate experience here, my review will display how the treatment from the venue staff really affects a customer's dining experience in its entirety.  I chose a light appetizer of the mango salsa ahi poke on tortilla bites to share, as we had just had a huge breakfast earlier in the day. Our friends highly recommended the tacos and the mushroom enchilada.  There is a trio of salsa and chips to accompany our meal. I felt festive and ordered a summer sangria and it was delicious.  On the first bite of the ahi mango appetizer however, my guy immediately stopped chewing and pulls out a metal item.  It shocked all of us... As it was the tip of a knife or some blade of a food processor maybe, but the size of his thumbnail.  It is by far the scariest dining incident I have ever encountered.  Immediately, he excused himself to the restroom to remove anything else he had in his mouth still and came back assuring us he was okay. By that time, our server already addressed us, removed our appetizer without hesitation, asked us if we may want something else. Within moments, the manager approaches us to ensure everyone's safety. Initially, before this review, I was hesitant to report on this Yelp forum vs their corporate site, what happened, as I really did not want to make it any more unfavorable as the situation was addressed thoroughly , but in hopes that other diners may ever encounter something like this, gosh forbid, they also will have the management be as attentive and professional as we encountered.  In the end, the staff did their best to remedy this unfortunate experience.  We can see how absolutely sorry they are. They immediately addressed needing to remove any processed food items necessary or already been prepared with similar tools, and all inspection of their kitchen tools in use. I'm confident they are inspecting each item thoroughly and continuously even after this particular incident.   I ordered up a cup of chicken tortilla soup in the meantime and still enjoyed my cocktail.  My guy insisted he was okay and while his appetite, understandably enough, went away, he did not dwell on it any further. We have both worked in the dining industry and while we have never encountered something like this, we genuinely feel it could have happened to anyone, maybe even in my own kitchen.  Maybe exaggerated, maybe not. Scary, nonetheless. The staff addressed the situation very professionally. I don't know myself, what further they could have done. The manager hands me his card, even after learning we were from CA, and insists that if we ever do return, to be certain to ask for him.  He notes that he hopes we will return for another visit in the future and give them a chance again.  Without our asking or expectations, yes they ended up comping our meal in its entirety, still pologizing profusely.  We made sure to leave a generous gratuity because I can't deny our server was anything but awesome and displays genuine pride in his job, even prior to the incident at hand. He had even suggested a new brunch place to check out since we commented earlier how we loved Cracker Barrel in AZ, engaging in conversation with us. I truly feel they wish they could have done more for us.  But, we really couldn't press the issue any further as we were all safe from what we could see.  Made for an interesting lunch topic, though! Relieved no one was hurt, more than anything. Angry, no. Would we return? I feel we may.  My only wish is that they continue to check their kitchen tools and I hope nothing like this ever occurs again.  I think we all learned something invaluable from this situation."}
{"text":"Mine and my daughters first time here.  The service was excellent! I ordered the smothered chicken burrito, but got beef instead, however it tasted pretty good so I told them about the error but decided to eat the burrito rather than wait to hane a new one cooked.  The manager waived my dinner and brought us each free ice cream even after I told him he didn't have to. 
Everything is homemade, the customer service is phenomenal.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Interesting food.. My favorite is the Mushroom enchillada and my husband loves the chile rellano, my granddaughter loves the Miso Salmon.. Great variety"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited this location yesterday. Things didn't start off so well as after we were seated, it took approximately 10 mins for anyone to come to our table. We weren't upset about it we were just like hey, what about us? lol. Luckily for us, the person that happened to check on us just happened to be one of the manager's, who name I did not get. But she greeted us with a wonderful smile and asked if we had been helped. Sadly we said no and she took care of us right away with assigning Phillip to our table and he was fabulous. The first round of drinks was on the manager, which was really sweet. Again we were not upset at all, just wondering what happened. At any rate the strawberry margarita I received was delicious as always. We also ordered the Trio, which was on happy hour and consisted of chips, queso, and salsa. Delicious!!! Of course we had to order their signature cornbread, which was fresh out of the oven upon arrival. It was melt in your mouth delicious and yet so bad for you so you know it is extra good. By the time my yummy street tacos came, I was full from everything else.  Like I said before, Phillip, our waiter was awesome, the food was delicious, and my company was as fabulous as ever. Will I come back to this location? Of course! I chalk it up a slight mishap and a busy evening. Plus in the end, the food and service was great so what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Always a good time coming here. Great service, great food, and AMAZING HAPPY HOUR! Mon-fri 3-7pm and sat-sun 3-5pm. Margaritas are bomb, my favorite is the fruit infused patron or the chambord. WARNING: they sneak up on you quick!  My favorite appetizers are the Tejas trio, shrimp & guac tostada bites, and street tacos."}
{"text":"My husband and I call Z'tejas \"old reliable\". When I don't feel like cooking and/or we need to meet for lunch near our house and don't feel like thinking too much, old reliable it is. 
We really enjoy the burgers, the chipotle mayo is tasty and the bread has a hint of sweetness. Unfortunately, there have been times were the bread was stale, not often but enough to remember.
The shrimp tostadas, fish tacos and tortilla soup are very good as well. The Chambord margarita is delicious and I like the pomegranate-ginger 
margarita martini drink, the ginger-sugar rim is very tasty. 
I have eaten at different Z'tejas locations and they are pretty consistent. 
Service is usually good, never had anything worse than waiting a bit longer for food or our bill."}
{"text":"I have frequent Ztejas regularly for years and have kicked off my bday celebration at their Happy Hour the last few years with a party of 10-15 people each year. I have always had a nice experience and a good time. However this past weekend I was celebrating my birthday at Ztejas Happy Hour with 9 of my friends and we were outside on the patio enjoying ourselves ordering drinks and appetizers. We weren't cussing or being vulgar language just laughing talking and having a good time. Again outside on the patio during Happy Hour. Apparently unbeknownst to us  another table felt were we being too loud and moved inside. The manager on duty at that time named Chris came outside and asked us to quiet down. And then had the audacity to say he didn't want to offend us. We all all corporate employees who know how to conduct ourselves in public and we're not in any way being disrespectful to others around us. Not only was I highly offended my bday kickoff was ruined. In a time when our country is dealing with so much racial insensitivity it was very offensive and a very poor decision on the managers part to come and ask a table full of paying patrons that were simply laughing, talking and enjoying themselves to quite down. Due to his lack of consideration for all of the customers he cause one of his waitresses to lose a lot of money that night and regardless we never should of been treated that way. I have no interest in ever visiting this restaurant ever again. Highly disappointed! Never have I ever been treated with such disrespect."}
{"text":"I just spoke with a manager this morning about an interesting experience last night at Z Tejas. The food was good. The queso dip would probably taste better and more authentic if it weren't made with American cheese. The guac was not salted. However, our entrees were good and I cleaned my plate. Love the free cornbread. Our waiter was very charismatic with us and we immediately thought, wow! What a great waiter! We thought that he was very nice and professional, even though our entrees arrived really fast, before our chips and dip (not even a big deal). That is when it seems like things took a turn for the worst. 

Mid conversation, myself and a friend were very suddenly distracted by an extreme screaming match going on right next to us in the kitchen. It was so loud and clear. My first thought was, jeez I hope our waiter isn't being yelled at -- then, after a quick glance, I realized that the person who was yelling was actually our waiter! Our jaws dropped. The restaurant would get quiet as the screaming commenced. The employees nervously paced and darted their eyes around. Whoever was being yelled at in the kitchen seemed to try to defend themselves, but the waiter was so relentless. We sat there eating, talking, and very frequently stopping to listen to the drama. 

I hate that I am leaving this review. However, the manager told me this morning that he would be emailing me. I haven't received that email yet. My friend and I who visited the restaurant work very hard, and it is not easy to just fork over $80 for a couple drinks, dinner and chips with dip... let alone listen to people be berated when we are just trying to chill! I hope to hear from management soon via email like promised. We want to come back because our entrees were fabulous, but last night was just downright unacceptable and unprofessional! We will go to another location if the Ray location is too problematic. Sad times."}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick lunch today and this place was recommended.  There is ample parking and is located in a shopping plaza.  We got there early and there was plenty of parking, when we left, the place was getting their lunch time rush. The inside was nice and open and decorated nicely which made for a pleasant visit.

We were seated immediately and our waiter started out with the drinks.  We let the waiter know that we were in a rush because we had to catch a plane, this is typically a good test of the urgency the waiter can relay back to the kitchen, which they nailed, great teamwork guys..  They serve some corn bread with butter which was warm and fresh and had a little bit of sweetness.  

I ordered the steak burrito which was covered in sauce.  The steak was nice and juicy and they were ample size cuts.  The burrito had a nice little spice to it and came with some rice on the plate. 

The only thing I think needs a little change is the salsa and chips.  None of the three salsa's were particularly spicy and didn't really stand out from one another even though they were different styles."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic! I live about an hour away from the chandler area but we needed to waste time to avoid traffic so we stopped in here for dinner. The atmosphere is casual but the restaurant itself is beautiful! 

I have been dieting so my mom and I split the chicken fajitas with corn tortillas. It was very good. They have a roasted salsa that's delicious and the guacamole was very good. Great portion to share. 

The service was excellent from start to finish! The hostess was very friendly and went over specials and even recommended dishes when we sat down. The server answered all our questions and was very prompt on refills and checking in with us. The manager also ran our food out to us and checked back to make sure everything was great. 

Overall great experience with food and service. Will be back when I'm in town. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Started great by getting seating right away, in a booth, on a Friday night. Had an attentive and wonderful waiter. Started with yummy tostada bites, good as always. Didn't care for my chicken tortilla soup, but was filled up with the appetizer, corn bread & beer."}
{"text":"Mass-produced mediocrity. I am not normally so blunt and so negative right at the start of a review, and yet this establishment seems best-described by this three-word opener. Crab cake appetizer was a cold bit of crab blended with a cold mass of filler, heaped on a confused mish-mash of greens, the best parts of which were the pseudo-Remoulade sauce and pumpkin seeds. Navajo taco special consisted of a few shrimp plopped into a mush of rice and cold black beans, all piled atop a cold and greasy slab of Indian fry bread. Hamburger ordered medium-well arrived rare. One good point, our server was very efficient and friendly, which made up in some part for the coldness of the greeter. Will not return."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.  Well decorated.  Customer service is great!   Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today with the padres as they are in town for a couple weeks.  The place was dead at 1 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon during some school's spring break.  

We were seated promptly.  Z'Tejas carries the Republic of Tea drinks, so some of us ordered Pomegranite, I ordered the decaf Ginger Peach.  They served us a skillet cornbread (guess that is their specialty \"bread basket\" )  For lunch I had the cup of soup: Gumbo was on the chef's soup special today.  The broth was thick, the sausage was spicy, the chicken was tender and there was just enough rice to consider it a gumbo.

I also had the Z' salad which was a small mixed leaf lettuce with tomato, green and red bell pepper, parmesean cheese and their own string like crutons.  I got the ginger vinegrette on the side.  It was just enough to fill me up, but not make me unbutton my pants. LOL.

The rest of the group had variations of enchiladas: mushroom, chicken and cheese.  The lunch plate size is very good, and included rice and choice of beans.  I am glad restaurants are finally sizing DOWN the portions!  I am tired of doggy-bags that sit in the fridge only to be tossed out."}
{"text":"If you gave Z any less than 4 stars - you've just never had one of their fab margaritas!  My favorite is the Cha-Mango (chambord and mango mixed).  But let me not get ahead of myself....

I don't live in a city with a Z'Tejas anymore, so I always make sure to stop in when I'm in Phoenix.  Before you go, just note, it's TEX-MEX, not Mexican food.  There is a difference and you have to know what you're getting into.  My favorite dishes are the baked seafood enchiladas and the jerk chicken salad.  They also bring you cornbread (with real corn in it) while you wait for your meal.

Z always goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service, so you never have to worry when you come in - you'll ALWAYS be taken care of!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch.  It was not as packed as I thought it would be.  It was nice, walked in grab a table, and the server immediately stopped by to say hello and ask what I would like to drink.  

The corn bread was SO SO good!!!  I ordered from the specialities section of the menu.  Five cheese macaroni & achiote chicken (made with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and Romano cheeses, finished with toasted bacon gratin).  It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Awesome food & drinks. Packed Friday night, I can see potential as good place to chill and meet peeps. 

I ended up just ordering bunch of appt and drinks since it was biz dinner, turned out perfect with portion of the food. 

It's tad noisy for biz lunch / dinner, but service was excellent and will come back again."}
{"text":"Been there numerous times, but never ordered steak until this last Sunday. I ordered what I thought was steak but received a piece of fat! Thankfully they did not charge it, it was a $29 plate."}
{"text":"I order to go fairly often from here. My daughter and I love the nachos. I usually order to go. We ordered the nachos, street tacos, and corn bread. I didn't ask them to separate the nachos so they were soggy by the time we got home. The street tacos weren't impressive. The corn bread was good as always. 

I'm not the best at checking my receipts when I get them as was the case this weekend. Today I came across the Z'Tejas receipt in my purse and started reading through it. I noticed there's a To-Go Service Charge and a To-Go Service Charge Tax!! I may be behind on the times but since when do you get charged to take food home? So do I get charged the same fee if I eat and the restaurant and take food home? It could be that I've been charged this before but didn't check the receipt. The mom and pop restaurants I frequent don't charge these fees. I won't be a regular customer of Z'Tejas any longer if I'm charged to order to go. I'm sure I can find some delicious nachos elsewhere."}
{"text":"The cornbread and service were decent/tolerable. The food was also okay. The voodoo tuna was good but not worth spending 22 dollars on I would rather spend 8 more dollars and get quality fish and a lot bigger cut then what little they give you here. I wish I would have ordered fajitas or burger or even the fish tacos so I would feel like my mom got her money's worth. Definitely will not come back most likely unless I have no choice in the matter. My sister was supposed to have spicy pasta and it wasn't even remotely spicy. My mom got jambalaya thinking that it would come with rice like at yard house and she hates pasta mind you, so when they brought pasta she didn't want to be one of those annoying customers that sends stuff back so she basically was picking at her seafood off of the dish the whole time.  My brother got the Mac and cheese he seemed to like it but it seemed like 3/5 ppl didn't enjoy their food enough to want to come back."}
{"text":"Went there twice this week for Happy Hour. Once to the Chandler location and once to the Scottsdale Mall location. I've eaten at both locations a few times over the past year as well.

Food: Very good. Always good flavor with being gratuitously spicy. Mushroom enchiladas are my favorite meal. I've tasted EVERY appetizer and they are all very satisfying. Good portion size for an app, which makes the happy hour prices all the more attractive! 

Drinks: Happy Hour Drink prices are quite high compared to other HH's. Otherwise, I guess they're pretty much in line. The Chambourd Frozen Margarita is delish!

Service: Never had a bad experience with the wait staff. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Seem to be perfectly okay with their tables ordering off the HH menu (some servers don't like the small tabs and it's reflected in their performance). Like I said, not a problem here (IME).

So this place always was one of our favorites and will continue to be until something changes."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and waited 40 mins for my food. They did not offer water. They gave me beef when I ordered chicken. Did not even apologize or offer to comp anything. Food really sucked. No flavor. After taking our order we did not see waiter again until he wanted the bill paid. 0/10 do not recommend to anyone under any circumstances ever."}
{"text":"I love this joint .. got nothing bad to say at all!  All of the wait staff are good but there a few that provide such GREAT service that you will be blown away.  AND get this, if you go a few times, some will recognize you and come to the table to see how you've been doing, even if you aren't at one of their tables.  Top that off with a creative menu and excellent execution and you've got one great date night!  I can't recommend this spot enough!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, environment very nice.  Music alittle loud, however.  Our waiter was rather rude to begin with, but seemed to regret it quickly and behaved himself for the rest of our meal.  I can recommend this place.  I was going to give them only 3 and a half stars, but my wife talked me into 4."}
{"text":"Love this place. Got seated quickly by very friendly staff. The food was amazing. Had the wild mushroom enchiladas. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Z Tejas several times and never had a problem. But this time... First off, we go to the hostess, ask for a table for two, and they say it'll be a 20 minute wait and they'll text us when the table is ready. Cool, no problem. We walk around Casa Paloma for a while and then 25 minutes pass without hearing anything. We head back to Z Tejas only to see a large party in front us walking in and immediately being seated. We ask the hostess when we could expect to be seated and lo and behold they find a table for us right away. Once we sit down, I look at the menu and see that the cornbread, which has always been free in the past, now costs $3. Not a big deal but still a bit chintzy in my opinion. We ask the waiter when the change happened and he says \"December 1st. Were you guys planning on just snacking on cornbread and hanging out?\" The rudeness of this statement and the implication that accompanies it stuns me. Believe it or not, just because I'm younger doesn't mean I don't plan on spending money for a decent dinner. So at this point we walk out and I make sure to tell the hostess why we were leaving and ask her to pass the message along to the manager. I will never come back and I will be sure to tell my friends and family not to either."}
{"text":"MY favorite Z's by far! The one on mill is decent but the bloody mary bar here on the weekends is much larger! My service is always amazing and cannot help but ask for the same server every sunday, I cannot believe I have forgotten his name but he is great! 
The bloody nary bar is full of different tomato juices and things to put in it, and if they run out of anything they are quick to jump and get you more. The cornbread and peach muffin are my favorite, I dont even like muffins but i always ask for an extra! I also love the jalepeno bacon and always get a side of that also, SOOOO GOOD!!
I have yet to come during any hour but breakfast but I must try because it is delic!"}
{"text":"Man can these guys cook some bomb shrimp! Drinks are great too.  Nothing is bad here."}
{"text":"Baked Seafood enchiladas were good. Queso appetizer great! Nice ambience and decor. Service slow and short of attention. Had to wait for anyone to come to table. Still waiting for containers and check and its been 15 minutes. Better service would have gotten them more stars because the menu is fun. Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Had a buisness dinner here last night. I was impressed the food selection was good. Good appetizers and good service. The setup inside was good. I need to come back and try the happy hour specials. I had the seafood enchilada which was good. I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"This location has gone from very good to just OK to terrible in the past months. Tonight was the end of our patronage to this Z'Tejas and probably all the others in the chain. We were 30 minutes into our wait when the manager approached 3 parties in the waiting area and advised that we could not plan to eat there as the 'kitchen was backed up'. There were empty tables when we arrived. Management at this location has hit rock bottom.  Obviously they have staffing issues. And the Sunday Brunch has not been worth the money since last Easter when they modified the menu.  They don't deserve the one star but it is the Yelp minimum.  Do yourself a favor, stay away!  We will for sure."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas never disappoints! Make sure to make reservations as it's delicious and fills up quickly!

Happy hour was pretty decent, 5 dollar drinks and apps ranging from 6 to 8. We always get the Tejas trio-chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso. Love that every meal also comes with fresh cornbread that you can take home. This is something we haven't had at any other restaurants, and it makes th dinner unique! I always get either the diablo pasta (delicious) but tried the Baja tacos this time. I had a couple of requests and the kitchen was very accommodating. My fiancé switches between burgers and fajitas and is always happy with his meal.

Our server was fantastic. Made great recommendations and was efficient with getting everything to us. I'd reccamend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Diablo chicken was amazing. I got mine without the jalapeños and it still had a bit of a zesty kick."}
{"text":"Don't eat or drink anything at this place! Came here after golf today with friends and ordered a happy hour margarita, it was mostly ice. Will never come here again and will tell all my friends to avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was craving Guacamole, as usual. We decided to try Z'Tejas since they make the table side Guac. 

Service was Extremely SLOW. 

By The Way, I think they should serve complimentary chips and salsa instead of the complimentary cornbread. 

Any how, I ordered the Guac and the Chips and Salsa. The 3 salsas were, House salsa (tasted like spaghetti sauce, too sweet, yuck) Verde with avocado and tomatillo ( good but really bland, I had to add salt) and Fire roasted ( most decent of the three but still on the sweet side and I had to add salt.) 

The Guacamole was the most disappointing of all though. I did order it with out cheese and onions but that shouldn't have made a difference. It was completely lack luster and flavorless. No Lime juice or seasonings were added to it at all, except Salt, by me.  And I rarely salt anything.

The husband did enjoy his breakfast enchiladas. 

The only reason they are getting 3 stars is because I do appreciate them having a small V/GF/VEG menu. Other than that, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better places to take a date, not to secluded, a busy restaurant yet you can carry on a conversation.  My pork arrived a bit raw so I did send it back, and I was hoping to get some kind of discount for it, but I've had way to many meals at this place so I can overlook it.  A bit pricey, but you can't find the type of food they make any where else.  I wish they had the Chilean Sea Bass all the time but it's seasonal, the most unbelievable piece of fish I've had."}
{"text":"The chile pork verde and the jerk chicken salad were delish.....and holy hell, the chambord margaritas. Amazing and potent but if you've had little sleep and no food, take it easy on these....especially early in the day. I had two and was shitaaaaay. o_o"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but yelp wasn't around when I came here. It was my birthday and I ordered the steak and it was marinated to perfection. My father brings home food from here sometimes and it is always good. Try it out, it's Tex-mex!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to this specific restaurant again.  I have been to this location for dinner about 5-6 times.  The last time I was there, the service was horrible.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to come by and TAKE our drink order.  Then we wait 40 minutes to cash out. 

DON'T GO HERE.  

Go to the one on Mill Ave instead."}
{"text":"We eat at this location every time we get to the Phoenix area. We have never been disappointed with our food, our server, or our time spent here.
My only complaint would be that there is no ZTejas in Fort Worth where I live."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a long day at work and wanted to get some drinks and split entrees! Z'Tejas more than delivered! Trevor, our waiter, was absolutely amazing! He gave us exemplary customer service with his energy, passion and knowledge of the food and drinks! The atmosphere was lovely for a late romantic dinner with dimmed lights and a low-volume sophisticated demeanor. The food was fantastic! We started with chips and salsa, then a bowl of tortilla soup and then the baked seafood enchilada which Trevor happily recommended! It was so yummy. You have to try the baked seafood enchilada! They even split it on two plates for us and we were very pleasantly surprised!I had the chambord margarita with a sugar rim and it was phenomenal--good amount of alcohol! My boyfriend had the Z Tejas mule, and he's pretty picky about mules--he loved it!  Great service, great food, great drinks and good prices! We'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"They got rid of the Bloody Mary bar. They're dead to me. Although, their jalapeño pancakes are... interesting."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.  Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.  I think I would love everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try them all.  Love It!!"}
{"text":"Two words: Chambord Margarita

I used to not even like margarita's, Z Tejas changed my outlook on tequila.  

The food is great too.  My usual favorites are the shrimp & guac tostada bites to start then move on to the artichoke chicken stack for dinner, and cornbread of course.  I've also tried the smoked chicken enchiladas and loved em.  Sunday morning brunch I have to have my egg hash...and a margarita :)"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I've eaten at Z'Tejas.  Decided to meet up with a friend and have a good Margarita and a bite or two.   Overall it was an excellent experience.

Service
-Amazing from being greeted at the door to our amazing server Missy.  She is amazing at what she does.  So amazing that I am writting this review a month later after finding my receipt.  She had amazing recommendations and I ran with them, every item she recommended what amazing.  It obvious she's knowledgeable about the menu and knows how to ask the right questions to provide the perfect recommendation.  One of the best experiences I have had with a server and I eat out tons.

Food
-Seasoned well, perfect amount of spice to it.
-Looked good and came out hot instead of looking like it had been under a heat lamp and coming out with the \"I've been sitting under a heat lamp look\"  
My Marg was on point! 

Atmosphere
-Busy, a bit loud but not unbearable.  It was what was to be expected during Happy Hour.
-Clean, tables being bused in a timely manner
-Clean Restrooms.

Overall I will make sure not to wait so long to come visit again.  I hope to have the pleasure of being served by Missy again as well."}
{"text":"Love the service! And the food is amazing, everything looks fresh and very well presented! And the plates can be shared!"}
{"text":"Great service! They serve cornbread instead of chips as an appetizer. It's yummy. The food is spicy and full of flavor. I was very impressed. And the dim lighting and decor make it a great place to take your date :)"}
{"text":"Tonight Z'Tejas let me down. It is unfortunate because I love the food here. I booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30pm. We were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant. Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. It all started out pretty well.

One of the members of our party had never been here before so he wanted to order three appetizers for us to all share. I recommended the Tejas Trio (queso, salsa and guacamole) and he told our waitress to pick two of her other favorites. Now I understand that he did leave this up to her discretion however, she chose two other items with shrimp and seafood in them. As a waitress I would have maybe considered that not everyone in the party would have liked seafood. I would have understood maybe one other appetizer with seafood but not both. Again, it was left to her discretion so I cannot say too much about this one.

I tried to get her attention two different times to order a margarita, both times she swiftly walked away, maybe I needed to be louder. All things I could have shook off if our meal would have been up to par as it usually is. I had recommended to the other members of our party to order the 21 day aged filet. We had previously had an amazing experience with this steak. Three of us decided to order this item. When they came out they were all New York strip and not filet. Not really that big of deal but when you are a expecting one cut of steak and you receive a different one, it is a little disappointing. My steak was supposed to be a filet topped with a peppercorn crust and topped with a mushroom sauce. It came out as a New York strip, topped with the peppercorn crust but no sauce whatsoever. My dining companions decided to keep the New York strips in lieu of returning them to re-fire filets. I decided to have a filet re-fired because my steak came out completely wrong. I reordered the new steak with the Gorgonzola butter instead of the peppercorn crust because it looked dry when it was brought out.

After waiting fifteen minutes, after all of my dining companions were finished eating, I received my new steak. It was a filet after all but it still came out with the peppercorn crust instead of the Gorgonzola butter. I just feel as though the entire night our waitress did not listen to anything we said. I really am not that picky but after getting all three of our steaks wrong, and getting mine wrong twice I was irritated. This was the place that my fiancé and I had recommended to out of town guests and I feel as though it was a big let down tonight. I just do not think our waitress could handle a big party along with serving her other tables.

I still might be back because I know how good the food can be here. I just think we came on an off night. Too bad."}
{"text":"I had to give this place three stars as an average of two and four from the two times I have eaten here. 
The first time service and food were beautiful. Actually, both times service has been top-notch. Never a problem with service. 
I again had the seafood enchiladas which are stuffed with tuna, salmon, spinach, and shrimp. This is really a delicious dish and full of flavor but the second time I had it, every other bite was cold (one hot, one cold, one hot, one cold) - weird. Also, some of the people I was with ordered steaks medium rare. Both came out well. Disappointing. 
They do have this different version of a mojito made with pineapple-flavored rum and mint leaves, with brown sugar. It tastes like candy."}
{"text":"I had the worst service with management at this establishment. I have come here for years with my family.  It was with much disappointment to find hair baked into our cornbread.  Instead of being embarrassed this manager was actually brash, cruel, and combative. Never visit this location! I will tell everyone about the experience I had here."}
{"text":"Z Tejas has been consistently good for me. My favorite dishes are the shrimp tostada bites and catfish tacos. This place is definitely one of the better chains out there. Good margaritas too! Half off all apps during happy hour too, so go there."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the service we received.  Our server was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full.  We enjoyed the Tejas Trio...the cheese dip was my personal favorite.  The green chile barbacoa enchiladas were great.  They had lots of shredded beef and a perfect amount of sauce.  Next time I have to try the mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"12/17/15 food was fine - today the service not so good! Will I be back yes so far food has been okay. Seems here the service has been a hit or miss. Was some busy but not slammed. Well maybe it was my fault the on tap beer selection is boring. Manager walked by and says hi, not how was everything and would have shared with her, my lunch order had been delivered before I got chips and salsa which I had to ask for. Oh well! Oh she was at the hostess stand when I entered - wasn't the friendliest greet, matter fact I was an interruption, she glanced around to find her hostesses, she didn't even stop what she was doing to help a newly arrived guest."}
{"text":"I've eaten at ztejas a ton of times and this was my worst visit. 45 minutes to get our food. Manager never even came by!"}
{"text":"I would like to thank Z for destroying my anniversary celebration. My wife has many many food allergies. So we don't go out too often. But when we do Z was one of our go to places. They used to have a gluten free menu. But they changed to a menu where they at least put a symbol by plates that were. They even once invented a dessert just so my wife could enjoy too. I was always impressed and that's why we came here.

First they sit us butted up against the service line. It was so loud I could not even hear my wife. Then I noticed a disturbing trend. The wait staff used right behind my head as a good place to hold meeting. Those meeting dealt with complaining, a LOT. Throw in some F-bombs and other language fit for a Waffle House and I was starting to get annoyed.

Then we notice, huh there are no markings on the menu for gluten free anymore. Well our waitress was BRAND NEW. I could see her shaking. She was sweet but the vibe of fear was coming through. My wife asked if she could ask what was up. Out comes a lady who said she was there 14 years. She tells us they just changed the menu MONDAY and this was the first time anyone noticed they forgot to mark things for gluten free. Now I am not sure how you miss this or if you are telling me this just to make it look like an over site? Are they going to REPRINT all the menus?

So we ask about fajitas for my wife, USUALLY they are a safe thing and she gets some meat and ton of vegetables. She eats very healthy and simply and understands she might not get the fanciest dishes. The lady comes back after a good wait and says the chef does not know what is in the marinade. THE CHEF DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS IN THE FOOD. So now I am done. I think they have finally just decided to go the Chilis route. Order frozen stuff, heat it up and pass it off as home made. Well I am sorry, I am ok with that if I am paying 10.99 a plate. But that is NOT Z Tejas. We got up and left and more than likely won't be back.

So if you USED to go to this place because of your food allergies I would think again. I am saddened because we have lost a good place. They used to be so darn nice and accommodating to my wife. I have been known to leave 25% tips here because they always took that extra step to help my wife and I really appreciated it. I have an idea this is what we will see more of because it is hard paying your staff the new minimum wage and not raise the prices. Just wished we would have known before they ruined my anniversary."}
{"text":"You have to get the Red Chile & Mango Steak salad here! It is so delicious and the best part is the salad is huge and I always have leftovers for the next day. It is definitely spicy so only get it if you like a nice kick. Also I recommend coming here for Easter Brunch! My family has been going for years now and they have there bloody mary/mimosa bar and it's a great price or if you really want to get a buzz get the Chambord margarita. It's frozen and you can't have more than 4 because it's that strong haha I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either. Nice folks, but the food is just \"sort of\" Mexican and expensive compared to Las Vegas, where I live."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour which is M-F 3-7 and weekend 2-6pm. Keagan the bartender is wonderful and attentive. Street tacos are great meat and the green Chile is tasty. Hooray for margaritas!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!
Stopped by here late after a long day. 
Service was fast, food was great, prices were excellent.
The chili con queso appetizer was good, and the fajitas are amazing. My husband had a simple chicken quesadilla which was also really good.
All in all, two appetizers plus drinks and fajitas we spent about $50 including the tip. Will definitely be returning.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite southwestern Mexican place. Their complimentary corn bread is yummy. I can eat that all day. The dish you have to try it out is baked sea food plate. OMG it is made to perfection. Every bite of it is enjoyable . They happy hour menu is also very exciting with $5 margaritas . Love the interiors and the food here !"}
{"text":"Trekked here for lunch one day with some work folk. It left an eh in my mind. Not a bad eh, which is usually a 2 for me, but more like an I'll-come-back-here-if-someone-else-is-dying-to eh, which leaves it at a 3.

I can say that the cornbread is exquisite. It's what cornbread should be. Corn and bread. It's not cornmeal trying to be cornbread. It's not some yuppie metropolitan height of sophistication's chef trying to be country. It's the no shit real deal. I appreciate that. I just have to remember to appreciate it in small quantities.

The service was pretty on par for it being lunch on a Monday. 

My main dish was the seafood enchilada which was pretty on point, but not as good as the one at Blue Adobe. I was pretty annoyed to see it came with tomato even though tomato was listed nowhere on the menu. I will remember that. I may just return and order cornbread with a side of cornbread."}
{"text":"WIfe finally dragged me kicking and screaming to a Mexican restaurant!  She tried the local Four Peaks Kiltlifter and we both liked it.  WE also wanted try the much lauded Chambord margarita, and since we were there for happy hour they brought us two each!  TOmunch on during the cocktails we had the Texas trio and chips, which was salsa, quest and guacamole.  I chose the catfish for my entree, and my wife went for the Achiote chicken chopped salad, with iceberg lettuce, avocado, black beans, Cotija cheese, bacon, roasted curbs, pepitas, Roma tomatoes, red cabbage and ranch vinagrette.  Great place!"}
{"text":"THEY FREEZE THE TEQUILA!  margaritas a great, and they have yummy snacks.  good for happy hour."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something I don't always get for my lunch break last week so I decided to go to Z'Tejas.  I'd been to their other locations but never this one surprisingly.  The hosts at the front were very friendly, the one who walked me to my table actually stayed and made conversation for a couple minutes which hardly ever happens anymore.  My actual server was very friendly too.

I was very happy to see that they had a Build Your Own bar where you could pick from a Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Screwdriver and one other drink I can't remember and it was incredibly cheap!  Only $4 for my Bloody Mary!  They had a wide variety of choices too as far as juices, fruits, vegetables, seasonings, sauces, it was hard to decide!

For my actual entree I ordered the Hickory Burger which has barbecue sauce, chopped onions, bacon, jalapeno mayonnaise and a couple different cheeses.  It was delicious!  Kind of a mess to eat but worth every splatter you get on your face and shirt.  I just wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're with someone you're trying to look dignified in front of... The fries were great too.  Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I was definitely happy with my decision to switch up my lunchtime location and I will for sure be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Went here for some happy hour margaritas and chips + guac. The margarita was okay, but I didn't taste much tequila in it. And it was pretty small...maybe I just like to drink...

The tableside guacamole is cute idea, albeit a little awkward. The texture was nice and chunky but there was something missing in the spices...cumin, perhaps?

I really liked that they had a vegetarian menu with decent-looking options on it. Not many chain restaurants in Arizona go out of their way to do that!

Overall, it was alright...nothing too special and still a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday before happy hour ended. On the way in a couple  leaving was saying how upset they were about the service. We were seated and the waiter didnt even greet us just asked what we want to drink. seemed annoyed that we wanted to hurry and order before 7. Their prices are outrageous. $12.00 for a tiny quesadilla regular price. I would only go for happy hour. The drinks are on point!"}
{"text":"Ya I just want to say I love this place!! How could you not? The found is outstanding every time I come in I know I will not be disappointed . Idk maybe it's the margaritas talking  but this place is a must try make sure to start out with the dumplings. The flavors in this dish alone gives them the four . It would be a five no doubt but it is always very loud and the service is a hit or miss. But to a foodie like myself the ambience doesn't  really ruin everything So enjoy over eating over drinking and your left overs in the morning! ( they have awesome portion sizes)"}
{"text":"The cornbread that they're so proud of is a bland version of jiffy corn muffin mix worst I've ever had. The five cheese Mac-n-cheese has no flavor they just melted some cheese over boiled noodles. The service was slow, the server seemed annoyed that he had to wait on me. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but I have not yet been disappointed. The food has been delicious and fresh every time and the drinks are always great! They don't skimp on the alcohol either. You must try the street tacos, the catfish beignets, and the Chombard Margarita. All excellent choices. The staff has been great both times as well. Attentive but not annoyingly so. I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere. 
Tried couple of appetizers: shrimp-avocado tostado bites and the triple option (queso, ): both pretty good
The warm corn bread they served before our order was just awesome. 
However I was disappointed with their chicken fajitas: not sizzling and the chicken wasn't succulent. 
My colleagues liked their shrimp pasta."}
{"text":"My husband and I love dining here as they have quick, professional service and the food is always pleasing to the tastebuds. My favorite item on the menu is the wedge salad with skirt steak topped with blue cheese dressing. It's bound to have your tastebuds go wow!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind folks, its not supposed to be authentic Mexican food. 5 stars for the all around good experience. We were seated promptly, service was fast and friendly (we made it for the last 15 minutes of happy hour!) Ordered pork nachos, Chambord margarita, duck relleno, and Mac and cheese. All the food was tasty, and the margarita was strong! Love the cornbread too. Have to warn you, the food is very HEAVY, delicious, but heavy. Reasonably priced, great service. I will return."}
{"text":"Co-worker brought me here for dinner on my last night in Tempe.  A Wednesday night and it was still busy, most likely because of their happy hour.  One small gripe is that their beer selection could use improvement.  They did have a couple Four Peaks available (good IPA), but they could stand to have a couple more local or micro options.  We skipped appetizers, and went straight to an entree with the exception of chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was above average.  I had the Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchilada with beans and rice.  The enchilada was really good, with the sauce having a good amount of spice.  The cornbread that was included with the meal was worth mentioning as well.  Overall a good meal and I would return when back in the area."}
{"text":"Great food as usual. I brought my parents here for the first time. They really liked it. My only complaint was the noise level. Wow! Right next to the bar screaming across the table to each other or the server. My hard of hearing dad just tuned out because he heard nothing but bar laughter and chatter. Next time a table far from the bar...."}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed at all. I was really excited about trying this place because a friend was raving about it. 

My friends ordered two micheladas, the guy asked \"do you want the beer mixed with the clamato juice? with lime? with a seasoning on the rim?\" we answered \"Yes!\" When the drinks came, it was just a glass of beer and a side of clamato juice for two beers. We were not aware that they had to share the juice. I asked for a cheeseburger well done, no bacon and it was medium well with bacon. I know I probably won't get sick if I eat pink meat, but that was not what I ordered. One thing my friend did like was the jalapeño mayonnaise. 

I have to say this place is over priced and not worth my drive. I can get better food and service in Tucson at Sir Vesas."}
{"text":"I don't think I get the Z Tejas paradigm.  I've gone here twice for work lunches on other people's dimes, and I can honestly say that the food doesn't make sense to me.  It's like they've taken great Mexican food dishes and then tried to yuppify them so they appear to be hip, trendy, and healthy.  They fail on all three counts and destroy the flavor in the process.

This particular restaurant completely forgot about one person's food and he had to eat awkwardly after everyone else was already done.  They comped his meal, but since he wasn't paying for it anyway, it was no consolation to him.

No me gusta!"}
{"text":"Went there today for the Sunday Brunch. So good!!!! I have food allergies and the manager, Jennifer was so helpful in making sure that I received the correct plate. I am in the restaurant industry and it was wonderful to see how much she cares about her guests!!! We will definitely be back again, and again!!! Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say nothing but great things about Z'Tejas. My husband and I eat here at least once-twice a week. I usually get the avocado chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries (YUM!!!!) and my husband gets the chopped chicken salad or the steak burrito. The restaurant is always packed, but the servers do a great job and are always attentive. 

If you're looking for a great happy hour, they have the best around, hands down. Nothing beats their chambord margarita and tejas trio. The best part is that they have happy hour on the weekends all afternoon!

If you've never been, you have to try it!"}
{"text":"I really wish I had had a better experience at this restaurant. We've gone probably 5 times in the last year and each time it's been progressively worse. I second the reviewer who mentioned how loud it was inside...I mean, music blaring - I couldn't hear myself think - loud. I actually politely asked the front person if they could turn it down just a notch and they looked at me like I was crazy. To make matters worse, our service was SO slow. We had gotten there around 11:00 a.m. for brunch and waited more than 30 minutes for our food, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. Each time we've gone there, it's been the same experience, so we've given up on this one. Bummer."}
{"text":"Thought the steaks were incredible and we weren't really expecting them to be.  Overall atmosphere was lively and fun.  Bar could be bigger, but still overall a very nice place and recommend."}
{"text":"The food had no flavor! Tortilla soup tastes like baby food. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"This place is great for anyone who's single the bar area stays packed. If your going here to eat with a friend or family member you may get a bit irritated. The noise level of this place is ridiculous (it maybe the super high ceiling and seating in an open area) you would have to sit close or yell out your convo to one another. The food is average I find myself asking for extra sauce and the menu changes so much you can really keep a favorite unless you eat here every other day. My waitress Maria was a sweet heart. Her customer service made my experience at lot better."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant!!! The margaritas are amazing!!! My husband and I go there for happy hour once a week!!! The macaroni is Dee-lish!!!! I highly recommend this establishment with its great food and even better drinks!!!!"}
{"text":"Z Tejas has been and always will be one of my favorites here in the valley.  First, the good is great quality and great value.  You can get a great meal for $15.  I know people knock it because it's a \"smaller\" chain....but don't kid yourself, some of the mom & pop shops in town are just terrible.  Second, Z has great service.  It's one of the best run resturants I've been to and I eat out a lot.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this pick for yourself or for guest."}
{"text":"Service was unreal bad, bartender smelled like an ashtray to begin with.
Was served cold soup with no flavor, he took our order without writing a thing down which was a mistake.
My burger was medium well, asked for medium rare and pretty tasteless.

I don't see the hype and won't be back, yuck"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service from Matthew & from Jenn the world's best general mgr.  Food was on time and hot. Always checking on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. 
Tom & Diane"}
{"text":"Came here today on 02/8/17. Ordered shrimp amd guac tostada bites and blackened cat fish taco appetizers which were delicious. For our entree we ordered the salmon salad and a seafood enchilda and everything was sooo delicious. The food is amazing, the service and atmosphere were both A+. Had a great experience. Will def be back. Also, chambord margarita and the bloody mary were great as well."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Service has been good too for the most part. Once when we went for lunch they accommodated us as best they could when it came to items we wanted from the dinner menu without us even making a fuss. That's the only thing I dislike about the restaurant. .. the seperate menus. I get why they do it though and just make sure to go after 3 if I want the dinner menu."}
{"text":"We had a Company Christmas Party here on a Friday night back in December.  Even with the place being packed, the service was awesome and the timing of the food was exactly as we had requested.  Everyone had a great time and loved the food.  I highly recommend booking a party here."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas has great margaritas (DUH), a great wine list and great food.  The atmosphere is awesome and I have never had an issue with service whether dining in the bar or in the dining room.  They are even nice enough to customize my margarita with jalapenos when I go there.  You'd think it wouldn't be that hard for a Mexican/Margarita joint but I have a hard time getting that request fulfilled at several places around PHX.

Bottom line, this is a great place for a date, a friendly get together or even lunch!!  The food will get you in the door and the cocktails and ambiance will get you coming back."}
{"text":"I came here once for happy hour, sat at the bar. I ordered the tacos and they were so delicious & packed with flavor. The bartender was very kind & the drinks were so good and pretty strong. I would definitely come back again. I also love the location, I had happy hour & then went and saw a movie."}
{"text":"With the interesting ingredients and combinations listed on the menu, we had expected to be dazzled by the flavors.  Unfortunately, the flavors were very bland and the only dominant one was chipotle.  Chipotle is overdone and overrated in our opinion.  Really expected some unique delicious food and were disappointed."}
{"text":"I find this place okay... it gives consistently a-okay food, but nothing great.  The prices are good and the drinks are good.  I find the food a bit heavy.   The salsas tend to be too sweet for my taste and no where nearly spicy enough.  It's a good alternative to other big-box chain."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go-to whenever I'm in town.  Their menu is pretty amazing and always has a great selection of interesting, unique southwestern food.  

My staples: the fish tacos, the catfish beignets, and now the Achiote Chicken chopped salad!  The tacos and beignets are always delish, but this salad is seriously scrumptious.  It has corn, avacado, and pumpkin seeds in it--which sounds like a weird combo, but it's great!  

Today, I also tried the southwester chicken soup.  So good-chunks of avocado with grilled chicken and tortilla chips.  The cornbread is always great too-definite comfort food.  

You can usually get a table pretty quickly there and their staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Service was best part of our meal experience. Pork tenderloin was over cooked, mixed veggies were flavorless, trout was dry and overcooked as was the salmon. Very disappointed as I know they can do better."}
{"text":"I didn't know Z'Tejas had multiple locations until this past weekend.  I had been to the one in Tempe ages ago, and an associate swore by the one at Tatum.  We happened to meet up at the Chandler location.

Everyone obsesses about the cornbread, but I don't love cornbread.  That's okay because the dip trio is amazing - guacamole, queso, and salsa.  The chicken enchiladas are very popular here, and it is probably because the chicken is smoked/roasted beforehand, so it has a nice flavor.

I ordered a salmon salad, and I loved it.  I normally don't like mixed greens, but I highly recommend it.  It was abnormally spicy for a spicy salad though.

It's so interesting because I feel like Z'Tejas is almost like a Valley version of Cafe Poca Cosa (Tucson); it has the same kind of vibe without all the hype.  Sort of a ritzy Southwestern take on Mexican food.  I am a fan, but the service was abnormally slow and confused when I went there."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas = awesome margaritas, delicious salsa and guacamole, ruby trout salad, and not to mention the often overlooked and missed bananas foster french toast of the weekend brunch. They also have many delicious other entrees, some of which I have sampled, but I must say I stick with the favorite standbys. Also a great place for a happy hour bite. Try the Millionaire margarita on the rocks!"}
{"text":"As PF Chang's is to oriental cuisine, Z'Tejas is to Southwestern.  Same idea.

I didn't say it was a good idea.  It's ok, not great.

PF Chang's pulls this trick off wonderfully.  Z'Tejas, not so much.

We went for lunch and were seated immediately.  The place we had originally planned on going had a line out the door.  

This is a huge restaurant and beautifully appointed.  Servers were all nice and did a good job.

It's a little dark in here.  It was lunch and had numerous windows but unfortunately we were not seated near them. I had trouble reading the menu.

The corn bread and butter starter is a nice touch.  Everyone likes a freebie.  It just wasn't that tasty.  Nothing special.

I went with a dish off their \"seasonal\" menu and it did not disappoint.  That being said, it wasn't overly special either.  The beans and rice were okay also but again, nothing special.

The bill came quickly and we were out the door in less than 45 minutes.  Very efficient.

Not the best southwestern food I've had but it's decent.  Don't expect much."}
{"text":"I ordered off of UberEATS and the food was extremely bland - which was rather surprising. The only flavoring that came through on the steak tacos was the raw onion. The steak itself was gray and sad. Also, the dish said it comes with Southwestern rice and black beans - nope, they lied. Just four tacos, for $16.60. $4.15 a taco. I wish I knew, you can get much better street tacos for $1.50 each right down the street from me. I thought I'd give Z'Tejas a try though, and what a let down. Additionally the corn bread is mediocre - tastes like corn bread you'd get premade from a local grocery store that's been under a heat lamp since the morning.

My boyfriend got the Green Chile Barbacoa enchiladas. In his words, \"I feel like I'm eating a TV dinner.\" All of the food was disappointing, and now I know that I won't be paying a visit in person or order from them again."}
{"text":"Holy Chambord Margarita! Where have you been all my life???

My first time, we did happy hour. Service was slow, but the food and drink made up for it. We ordered three appetizers and two rounds of the delish chambord margaritas. I am not usually one for frozen drinks, but this was wonderful - like frozen raspberry lemonade with a great kick!

My second time, I went with a big group of kids and adults for lunch. Everything we ordered was perfect and delish and the service was great.

The third time, I went just for the chambord margerita on a friday night with my husband around 10pm. It was standing room only - packed - all the pre-clubbers were getting their drink on. 

I have been another handful of times just for the Chambord Margerita. The food is great, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. I will still frequent."}
{"text":"Get the Chicken Chop Salad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Phew, now that I got that important information out there... I can tell you that it was a delightful lunch.  Our waitress was spot on and really fun.  We also ordered the Nacho Trio app and the cheese was sooo gooey, spicy and delicious!  And then there is the cornbread... that was too good to pass up too! And since we were having mexican, we had their $6 margaritas and well, it was a great girl's lunch!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I frequent this place for lunch a lot as we always enjoy the atmosphere the food and the complimentary cornbread.  Unfortunately I'm mixed on the new direction they've chosen to go as the cornbread is no longer 'complimentary'. 

It's now $3 and the complimentary item during this time is chips and salsa! I gotta admit, they are good (salty) but the main drawl was that, cornbread!! The $3 goes to the community which is cool, but not a fan as I don't know how much really goes to them, etc.... I 'm not going to lie I don't like having that pushed on me, maybe as an option yes. 

It would be like Red Lobster telling me if you want cheddar Bay biscuits now you got to pay a dollar for everyone u eat... Or even Red Robin saying no more bottomless fries, or no beverage refills... I could go on. Probably will return, but not for lunch. Would liked to see it again as an option donation for a specialty drink, a new dinner menu item, a desert, etc..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, first & foremost. Kudos to manager & staff. Menu is terrific. Grilled seafood enchilada was outstanding. (I'm a bit tired an in hurry, so would have otherwise had more here!) look forward to returning, for sure. Very very good value!!"}
{"text":"Always good! Like most of the other Yelpers...Cornbread is Crazy Yummy, Margaritas are Tasty & Potent! Everything here is consistent, service, food, and drinks."}
{"text":"Banana fosters and the enchiladas were tasty :) service could have been a little quicker. Great atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Were the steak tacos supposed to be purely made of steak fat? To top it off, got charged for a beer that I took two sips of and sent back. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I visited Z'Tejas years ago while I was in college.  A friend and I were searching for nachos and decided to try Z'Tejas for happy hour.  I was super disappointed.  The green chili pork nachos were decent with the meat being the best part.  The street tacos and shrimp tostada bites were meh.  The best part was probably the complimentary corn bread."}
{"text":"Appetizers aren't good!! And waaaay to pricey! The drinks are wonderful though. A good overall happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Typical chain \"southwestern/Tex Mex\" food in a corporatey atmosphere. They have some tasty dishes and a killer sunday brunch, but everything on the menu is kind of ambiguous.

Prices here are about on par with most places of this type (I put it in the Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Charleston's, etc.) category. 

I enjoyed my visit to this location better than my visits to the PV and Tempe locations."}
{"text":"Ztejas on Ray Road is one of my favorite places to have lunch.  The food is all made from scratch... did you know that?!  Great margaritas yes but no pressure to drink when sitting at the bar.  I could sit there for hours working on my laptop and the bartenders don't mind.  They have free wi fi now did you know that?! so many great things about this place.. It's never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Kudos for having a separate vegetarian menu -- it made it really easy to order. The chopped salad I had was decent, though more like a poor man's version of Burmese tea leaf salad. Minus one star for charging four bucks for chips & salsa."}
{"text":"Just had brunch for the third time here and it's was great. You can make your own bloody Mary with a variety of things the food it's delicious and the service it's great! Best thing it's every time we came here there is never a wait for a table and you get complimentary chips and salsa :)"}
{"text":"Terrible food and mediocre service. Tap water is so disgusting it shouldn't be served to customers. My coffee creamer was so dirty it looked like it hadn't been washed. \"clean\" silverware wasn't even polished so it had water spots all over it. The \"chef\" here is just an egotistic glorified expediter who tells the line cooks when to fire another quesadilla and sifts through a book of rotating corporate specials and picks one and lacks any really creativity or talent. Definitely way better choices in the area"}
{"text":"Great vibe, decent service and food was alright. I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas. They were average, the black beans were tasty, the cojita cheese was a great topping. The rice tasted like it came from a box - needs a lot of work. I also tasted the steak fajitas. The steak was surprisingly good as it was tender, juicy, and seasoned well."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with some co-workers on our way back to the office after an interview.  Was seated quickly and our server arrived shortly there after to take our drink order . . . drinks arrived and our order was immediately taken.  Quick service.

While waiting for our food we received a telephone call letting us know that we had gotten the project . . . whoo hoo a $13,000,000.00 school . . . just wat the doctor ordered.

Back to the food . . . it arrived quickly and hot . . . ordered the Chili Relleno . . . which tasted great, along with the corn bread.  So why only four stars you ask . . . I have to go back once the high from getting the new project wears off . . . just to verify that they do deserve five stars . . . didn't what my judgement clouded.

With that said . . . see you here again soon . . ."}
{"text":"The margs are the best.  Seems like the food is slipping a bit to me.   Stick to the Chopped Salad....its really good.  Their chips....yuck.   But the drinks are great.  Make me very happy."}
{"text":"As I live close to this location I am a frequent visitor. And every visit has proven to be a great one. The staff is always friendly and appear to be working hard. The food is always prompt and delicious. I almost always order the Fish Street Tacos and they NEVER disappoint. The queso is always a favorite too. Although I tend to pass on their guacamole. And if you're a margarita lover then you must try the Fusion Frozen Margarita. They top it off with fruit infused Patron and it is refreshing and strong! Don't have more than 3! I would always recommend this location to any friends and family!"}
{"text":"I sat down at the bar an hour before closing for a late lite dinner. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it was delicious! I also had the ancho fudge pie. It tasted like a warm brownie with whipped cream on top, very yummmy. Overall, I had a good experience."}
{"text":"I've always had great service and hot food here. I really love the guac tostada bites and the diablo chicken pasta."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I will have to come back, I might increase to 5 stars. Service was a bit slow, but the food was incredible. Wild mushroom enchiladas and Smoked chicken chili rellenos..... Thank you sir may I have another. Prices are higher than average, but worth it if you want a outstanding Mexican/southwest meal. It has a very modern ambiance and decor. It can get crowded and loud."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to eat here while we were out of town with our kids.  The kids didn't really care either way about the food or service so I'll only talk about kid food quickly and just note what the adults observed and from two different prospective:

We were sat pretty quickly and given our menus.  I thought the menu was boring and lacked any kind of imagination.  My friend thought it was swell.  (Menu has brunch and 10 different kinds of Mexican food orders all \"tex-mex\" style).

They have a Bloody Mary bar and a Mimosa bar which is actually kinda cool and something that I had never seen before.  You order the booze, they bring it to you and you go to the bar and put in your fixins.  The offer different tomato juices, garnishes,  and spices for the Mary's and then OJ and different berries for the mimosas.  My friend got a Mimosa and had fun doing it.  I drank tea 'cause I don't dig on boozing it up before 6:00.  

The decor is pretty cool.  They are trying to be super up-scale but it's not really working.  It really just looks like any other chain I've ever been - it was nicer than say......a Chevy's but I wasn't horribly impressed.  My friend thought it was pretty neat and enjoyed the fun liquor bottle tree they had on display.  (Wrought Iron with empty bottles glued to the stems).

Okay - DRUM ROLL - Food time:

They serve cornbread where most places would serve chips and salsa.....I think that's weird.  My friend thought it was cool and said it was very tasty.  I'd just as soon have them take $2.00 off the bill and keep it away from me when my palate is gearing up for the Mexican dishes.

We both got the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas.  They totally don't come with quac and they charge $1.00 for it.  - NOT COOL.  The Enchiladas are not really Enchiladas.  They are two small soft shell taco tortillas with cheese and chicken in the middle of them.  Basically it's a $13.00 quesadilla.  It does come with rice and black beans and it does fill you up but it shouldn't be called an Enchilada.  I thought mine was just A-OK, bland and boring.   My friend got a chicken bone in hers.  It was pretty sizeable - probably about an inch long.

One kid got a burger which he liked.  The other kid got the poached eggs w/ potatoes.  He said the eggs were awesome but the potatoes were pretty poor and he wouldn't order them again.

My friend complained about the bone so the Manager took that entree off her bill and gave her a free slice of pie which was nice of him.

They have $10.00 tableside guac which is about 1/2 an avocado............huh.......all I'm saying is I can totally dice up 5 of my own avocados for that price.

I wouldn't go back.  I wanted to give this place 2 stars because the food was boring and the whole experience lacked anything worthy of memory retention.  I ended up giving it 3 because the Manager cared enough about bones to give away free pie.  

My friend hated this place and if it were up to her the review would be lower.  But it's my Yelp, not her's so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.

On my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.

I dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.

Now for my second review.

My boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.

I was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.

Where to begin?

The dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.  

So, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!

Well, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.

Swoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!


In other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.

{"text":"It's close , usually pretty good , and fast .
I have several favorites that I almost always get.
The smoked chicken Chile Relleno is always good.

Popped in on a Saturday and  didn't know about the (new?)
Brunch thing going on.
Oh well, they had some interesting things, so I ordered a dish I had at Crackers Cafe on Elliott - that was super good there.
Migas.
Scrambled eggs, cheese, jalapeño or some kind of chilie, tortilla chips, all melted together.

Not.

Couldn't really discern where the eggs were, they had to be so dry... The whole thing was dry dry dry.
Cheese? What cheese? I saw nor tasted a scrap of cheese.

I ended up eating the potatoes - that were good , but not what id pay 9.50 for.

Pass this weak version and head the Crackers for a delicious take  on it.

But one more thing that really bugged me... The waitress was super sweet  and pretty good ; I did get the wrong muffin delivered, but since I liked both kinds it wasn't that big a deal.

BUT, the cornbread- that used to be free- is now on a donation program: if you \"buy\" it for $3.00, all proceeds go to a local charity.

Alone, the meal would be big enough. I really wanted no cornbread. 
BUT , she spent 30-45 seconds going over it, showing me the card explaining it (on table),
And telling me if I couldn't eat it they'd box it up for me!
Wow!
Really felt pushed to get this $3.00  bread I did not want.
I'm ashamed to admit I did order it. And she did box it. And I'll most likely throw is away.

Hey z tehas- show me card- let me read it, and decide on my own. No pressure!
I think they may have a contest for who sells more...
Sure felt like it.

So, fairly poor quality meal , and $3.00 wasted, while feeling first guilt, then frustration that I caved!
Damn.

I won't be back for brunch again!!"}
{"text":"I'm officially back to loving Z'Tejas !!! They not only remade the menu, but they brought back the dumplings!!  the service from Matt at the Chandler location was perfect, and the food was back to AMAZING ...try the chefs special Chicken  fried sandwich. Z'Tejas you have us back, see you next week"}
{"text":"Good Tex-Mex! Good Bar!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. There were 12 of us and our waiter took great care of us in spite of the group size. We asked for separate checks and he didn't show any signs of an attitude at all. At the end, when our checks came some of us realized he had forgotten to charge us for our sodas. When we pointed it out to him, he brushed it off and said, \"If it's not on the bill, it won't be there at all. Don't worry about it!\" Now if only all our waiters can forget about charging us for alcoholic beverages...

As for the food, my favorite was the free corn bread. Fresh from the oven, piping hot, sweet, with whole kernels of corn baked in and served in a mini baking pan. I could have eaten an entire pan of it and called it a night. In hindsight, that's what I should have done. The birthday girl suggested I try the Grilled Miso Salmon since she knows I LOVE seafood, adding that it was \"pretty decent salmon considering we're in the middle of the desert.\" I'll also admit I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. Well, let's just say I'm sure there can be better salmon found in the middle of the desert than at Z'Tejas. The salmon was overcooked even though I asked for medium rare. The mashed potato cake on the side was just a lump of dry mashed potato that tasted like it was leftover and sitting in the fridge since last Thanksgiving. I definitely should have gone with a salad or Mexican dish."}
{"text":"Good place to come after work.  The appetizers on the happy hour menu are the way to go.  I was very disappointed in my seafood burrito - hardly any toppings at all!"}
{"text":"We usually dine in when we eat at Z'Tejas, but this time decided to place a to go order.  The hostess sent me to the bar to pick it up, which I hate.  As usual when this happens, I stood at the bar with my thumb up my a$$ waiting to get the bartender's attention.  He was super busy while the hostess went back to her podium to do absolutely nothing.

The food here is decent.  One dish I highly recommend is the diablo chicken.  If not for this dish, I probably wouldn't eat there as often though.  The corn bread is a nice touch and they're not stingy about bringing more."}
{"text":"I'm kind of middle of the road when it comes to Z.  I think they're OK for happy hour, though their drinks aren't that great of a deal, but you don't need too many either.  Ada G. is addicted to their Chambord Margaritas and recreates them at home for us too.  As for their other food.  I've had a salad I liked and some apps were good but I've generally been a little disappointed with the rest.  My friend B's husband used to be a bartender at Scottsdale so once upon a time, we put in many Friday nights at the bar, sampling the wares.  Nowadays I just go for a \"normal\" happy hour and I'm not having to drive back to her house Sunday afternoon to get my car.  I'd have to say it's a much kinder, gentler approach.  Try them for happy hour.  Sit on the patio, enjoy the weather (unless it's summer) and have a margarita and some tostada bites.  I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible! Do NOT waste your time or hard earned money here. This restaurant has been having issues for at least the last year.

It's been about a year since my last visit and I decided to give it another try. Wow, big mistake. We got to the restaurant about 1:00 pm, well after the lunch rush. Although something tells me they don't get big crowds. The restaurant was pretty quiet, not many patrons. We got seated at a booth by a window which was nice. After that the whole experience sucked.

The waiter finally came to take our order. About 20 minutes later he came by the table and I asked about our food. Did they need to go to the store and buy it? And then prep it all? The restaurant was uncrowded. Why was it taking so long?

Surprise! He immediately comes out with the food. And guess what? It was COLD! I was not happy, but since I hadn't eaten anything all day and was starving, I ate it. 

It was really gross to eat something cold that would've been so delicious if served hot.  At least the food temp went up to 98.6 once it got inside my tummy. Oh, and the waiter, Ryan, never apologized or gave us a reason for the delay.  Clearly it had been ready for a while and he neglected to get it.  Terrible service.  He never once came by to ask us how it was, as is customary in most restaurants.  Probably because he knew he messed up big time. 

I did not see any manager on duty, which may be part of the problem. This restaurant has been in decline for quite some time now. It's sad because it used to be a great place and now it just SUCKS!

And I have to mention that my husband's burger looked quite red inside.  Definitely NOT medium well as ordered.

Please do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here. Not worth the frustration and the food's not cheap either.

If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Crazy good value. Super Happy Hour. Tasty food.  Friendly and fast service. Highly recommended!  Living off the appetizer menu works wonders. Even the cole slaw is awesome!"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is your typical \"higher end\" chain restaurant. Good for families or casual yet sit-down meals. They do southwestern, tex mex, with a good mix of seafood, too. 

I really liked the the corn bread that's complimentary..haha! Super warm, fluffy and delicious.

Weak wine list, but good margaritas/drinks. Service was great - our servers were constantly checking on us!

 Overall, a decent option in Chandler, especially for groups of 2-6 people. Lots of the food is shareable."}
{"text":"Upper level Mexican food. Very flavorful. Large portions! The environment was loud. I had the chicken diablo with shrimp and it was delicious ."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch. I had no idea what to expect from this place.

We ordered the chips and salsa. I also ordered the smoked duck tacos. 

The server was nice and attentive to us. When we arrived, it was around 2pm so it was pretty empty.

Since this is a mexican restaurant, I was expecting different items on the menu. Well, it is a chain so it seems more of Mexican fusion than real Mexican food. 

The chips and salsa came with three different types of salsa (one green one that had some avocado and two red ones [one was spicy and one was mild]). The salsa was good but nothing exceptionally. The chips were nicely crispy and they came in two colors.

The cornbread is buttery and filling. It is soft and I can taste little bits of corn in it. It comes with a side of butter but I didn't add butter to it because I felt like it had enough flavor. The cornbread comes out hot and fresh.

My smoked duck tacos were good. I like the side of slaw with it, it gave a fresh crisp to it. The marinade for the duck tacos were a little overpowering. They definitely did give a lot of duck sauce. The plating was nice, it was on a long rectangular plate. It was a little difficult to eat on such a skinny plate. The tortilla was nicely crisp and not too soft so it made it easier to eat. The sauce seems like a mayo-based sauce on top. It was good. I did wish they gave us more slaw on the side though. I like the duck meat although they had lots of sauce on it.

Parking is in the parking lot so parking is easy.

+Good cornbread
-Not real mexican food, so if you want real mexican food, this is not the place to come too
+Plating is nice
+Service is attentive"}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour ever. I highly recommend the pork nachos. They are delicious and a steal at happy hour. The atmosphere is fun but can be a little loud.  The open layout is nicely done though."}
{"text":"Don't show up early and before your entire party is at the restaurant. They will not seat you at a table unless half your party is present.

Oh, okay....I guess I won't spend more money on a drink and appetizer while wait. Makes no sense.

Update--------

Within 10 minutes of posting my review, the manager Steve came over and apologized for the treatment I experienced. The host that I had dealt with was new and had confused their Friday night seating policy. Steve promised to review the policy at their host/hostess meeting the next day.

After our meal Steve offered free deserts to our entire table.

Feel much better about this place."}
{"text":"Now I know where to go for a really good catfish beignets! Warm customer service, nice atmosphere, very tasty street tacos and grilled shrimp guacamole tostada bites.
Happy hour is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since I first turned 21, and I'm almost 30, but that was the scottsdale location. Ouch, sorry it's been so long!! I'm upset I haven't been back sooner.

The man and I wanted to grab some dinner before hitting the casino for some gambling, and when I turned onto Ray Rd and saw Ztejas, I was sold. I knew what I wanted to drink, obviously the chambord frozen margaritas, because that's what I remembered from my first visit. They did not disappoint! 

The man wanted to order the corn bread, and it came out hot, delicious with soft butter. Yum! I wanted the shrimp guacamole tostada bites, and I wanted more of them after that first order but we decided on sharing the chicken avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries. The chicken was so hot, juicy and tender, and the flavors were on point! The sweet potato fries came out a minute after the sandwich but for good reason, FRESH! 

The bartender was so nice, and kept our drinks full and is fast and efficient. Didn't catch his name, but don't loose that guy as a bartender."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night with my sweet friend. We use to go to this place all the time at the Scottsdale mall location. This was our first time going to this Chandler location and boy was it lovely!
 We came kinda close to closing time. Around 8:15pm( they close at 9pm).
 Our server was very friendly, attentive and nice which is always a huge plus.
We were brought out chips and salsa for starters. I am not much of a chip girl but these chips were really well made and the salsa was quite tasty.  We also ordered a round of there cornbread because it is really yummy. 
For entrees we both have our tradition of ordering the mushroom enchiladas. I know this may not sound appetizing to some but it is actually quite amazing even if you don't love mushrooms.  The food came out super quick it was awesome. 
The prossecco they had in stock was high quality and we were brought little fruit cups at the end. 
Overall we had  such a nice experience I am glad to hear they have a location in Austin Texas!"}
{"text":"Waiting 30 minutes to get water another 45 five minute to get my food no thanks there are better place in town with better service. If it wasn't because of my friend s birthday I would of walked out long time ago. It is seems like employee doesn't care about this establishment and want this place to fail."}
{"text":"Visited Z'Tejas last Thursaday night.  After a flight, getting settled in, my wife and I ventured out on a very hot August evening.

Greeted kindly at the door, got to our seats, welcomed by our server, McKenna.  She was kind and talkative and inquired about our day.   More so than most, which made me feel a bit more connected to the experience.

The food was all very good (not super duper, but very good).  Wasn't sure what to expect as it's a new chain that I've never visited.  I ordered the turkey burger, and side salad, my wife ordered the Ahi tacos.  The table cornbread was fresh and yummy.  We also ordered table-side quac.  Well prepared, again by our server.

The bar looked entertaining with a beautiful Tequila Tree.  Wasn't in the mood for a drink but certainly would next time.  

Everything was pretty good!  Would certainly return."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, I'm giving 4 stars because of the awesome, yummy and STRONG chambord margaritas!  Love them!  You only need 2 of these delectable delights to get your blood flowing (really, you only need 1).  The food alone would get a solid 3 stars for me -- consistently decent, but not great.  I usually get the street tacos or the tostada bites when I go for happy hour.  

Happy hour on Fridays is always packed.  Get there early to get seating in the bar!"}
{"text":"Great food, attentive service!!  Must go to when in Chandler!! I ordered the salmon and it was delicious. Also had the margarita at happy hour which was a great price and a top notch drink. Our waiter was great as well as the manager who stopped by our table to check in with us. Very impressed!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed it very much.   Nice upscale decor but very noisy. You will be greeted with a small skillet of very good cornbread with whipped butter.  They have an extensive menu with many unique items. Had a Margarita for $5 from the happy hour menu (weekdays 2 - 7).  For my entree, I chose the Anciote chopped chicken salad.  An interesting choice. The grilled anchored chicken was seasoned and cooked expertly.    It was placed on top of shredded iceberg, Roma tomatoes, red cabbage, cotija corn, black olives and pepitas.  Each in it's own section of the salad platter.  Oh, and I almost forgot, we had the Tejas Trio from the happy hour appetizer menu consisting of salsa, cheese sauce Nd guacamole.  Good Stuff!  The service was great with our server actually boxing our leftovers for us along with extra chips.  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place it's my favorite restaurant in Arizona! It's also a great place to bring visitors in town. We love sitting at the bar and getting their world-class margaritas! Plus bonus the bartenders are fantastic as well as the waitstaff! We split the tableside guacamole along with the ribeye with blue cheese and caramelized onion sauce and they're both phenomenal! Their z  salad is so amazing for such a simple salad we love it with the red wine vinaigrette dressing! Other dishes we've enjoyed in the past are the Diablo chicken pasta, the chili rellano and the achiote chicken chopped salad! Our favorite margarita has become the paradise where they add extra shot of grand Marnier! Perfect place for a date night or for a fun afternoon happy hour! Love love love

Only downfall would be they seemed to up their prices on both the menu and happy hour... At least get back to good hh prices cause that's a huge draw!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for awhile but were SO happy to revisit. Our meal from start to finish was top-notch and our server couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. Darn, I wish I could remember his name - a clever nickname that I swore I'd remember. Oh, well - he was amazing. Our fresh guacamole was terrific and that cornbread is always cooked to perfection. Can't get enough! Our margaritas were dynamite too. I ordered the ruby trout and it was spectacular. Loved the sides as well. My friend ordered the stacked enchilada and that was flavorful too. I don't think you could go wrong with just about anything on this menu. Oh, and Happy Hour prices are very affordable. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!!!!  Love the happy hour when I can make it.....  The street tacos are fantastic.   My family and I haven't had anything we wouldn't eat again here.  The bartenders are Awesome!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. It's clean and the staff are friendly. And of course, the food is great. Try the avocado chicken sandwich, the bread is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner during happy hour.  Very good $5 margaritas...loved the patron fruzion.  The others I tried were ok...chambord was way too sweet for me.  The app and dinner were very good!  Will be back soon!"}
