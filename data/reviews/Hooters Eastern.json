{"text":"I'm a huge Hooters fan.  Everything about it.  But not this one.  The atmosphere is terrible and the place looks nothing like an actual Hooters.  No wood framed walls or sarcastic but clever signs anywhere.  Just a boring same ol' place.  The bar area is ok but the last time I went.. there was a male bartender.  Sorry guys but Hooters is not for men serving me beer and wings.  I wish they'd bring the one back that was in Sunset Station."}
{"text":"The servers were super friendly. We were seated right away! We ordered the fried pickles, which were pretty good, but ordered the Parmesaan garlic Daytona style wings and they were moist and flavorful. I enjoyed these by leaps and bounds over Buffalo Wild Wings. Would come back as long as they keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"No stars period!  The nicest GUY in town bartending.  Hello, a GUY in hooters.  Do I need to say more?  Who owns a hooters and thinks, \"gee, I'm going to hire a guy to work my bar called HOOTERS\".  I'm no MBA but get a clue, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Slow service .. girl couldn't get drink or food order right. Even a manager came out to confirm an order and it was like telling my five year old three times what was wanted. The garlic parmesan wing sauce was nasty .. I will be breathing garlic for a week."}
{"text":"Have not been to Hooters in a while, used to go to one at their Hotel or one in Sunset a lot.  tried this one-   what a mess.   First, sat us by door near smoking lounge/bar area.  staff kept door open the entire time.   should be closed as it is smoking area and nobody under 21 is permitted to go in.      service awful-  we ordered an appetizer and asked for it to come out before our two meals.   had the bread pretzel sticks with beer cheese.  bread was raw in spots, cut into tiny pieces.  had it about 1 minute when meals dropped off.   told server V___  that we didn't want them right away- she replied \"oh well they made them already\".  no apology, nothing.  our buffalo shrimp as well as chicken wings were not \"medium\" not a bit of heat to them.   server never came by to see if OK.  wouldn't have mattered since she did not care about the initial issue.  never offered another drink either.  in addition, we never received any silverware - had to ask and wait for that too.   I remember Hooters being a FUN place-  great music, charming staff, even had games to play like Jenga-    this place has none of that appeal to it.  was a real disappointment.  seems like staff just doesn't care and do not like their jobs."}
{"text":"Went to Hooters for the first and last time, last night. It was about 6 pm and they had only about 5 customers there, all at the bar. Thant should of given me a clue. Ordered drinks and they got a screwed up. Then ordered dinner,  wings where OK not great but eatable, ordered some sliders and they where not eatable at all. Service was bad. They had about 10 hooter girls there just standing around talking to the 4 men customers at the bar. And that was just about all they did. Even the Manager was sitting at the bar talking not paying attention to anyone else. Will never go there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Hooters, for Happy Hour, we were greeted promptly and sat at a booth.  And that is when the good service ends. Been to so many Hooters across the US that was surprised that the service really stunk. We did get the wings we ordered .. beer for husband and when it was time for a refill she said you are having XYZ and he said no and said Z.. I had ice tea and no lemon.  The couple we were with did not get their french fries ..when they asked the server .. well she just didn't remember.  Wings were good, the fried pickles.. have had better.. wing were buy 10 get 10 no coupon needed.  Our server left and another server picked up our table.. wish we would of had her from the beginning.. in my ice tea refill, without asking, I got a lemon woo hoo. May or may not go back to this Hooters again"}
{"text":"Called in a to go order! Tiffany was so helpful! Thank for being so patient with our group."}
{"text":"I came in with 2 friends(we all happen to be gay). It took the waitress 15 minutes just to take our drink order. Then she had to come back because she forgot what one of my friends ordered. We finally ordered food and after 45 minutes asked for a manager because our food had not arrived. He went to the back to check on our order. He then came back claiming that he checked the security footage and we had only been waiting 20 minutes for our food. All 3 of us were wearing watches and we're now waiting close to one hour for a small food order. This place obviously is targeted towards straight men and the manager made that pretty clear by his actions. He never offered an apology and I would advise avoiding this establishment if you care at all about the LGBT community"}
{"text":"Took my husband in last night for a suprise dinner. First time at the new location. The place looks great and seems to be running smoothly considering it just opened. Highly recommend to be put in Sam's section if you go. She was a great server and had a great personality, made our evening even more enjoyable. Great service. Good job!"}
{"text":"I've heard some people say lately when I mention that I went to Hooters \" oh their food is terrible\". the last person when I asked when was the last time they had been there answered \"Never\". If I go to any restaurant i find certain things which I could consider terrible but I don't make a generalization that the restaurant is bad. Have you tried the bread and cheese appetizer or the buffalo Shrimp, these things are awesome and I could name a few more. I have some items on the menu that does nothing for me but with a open mind I have found more good choices than bad and the service is great. Order some wings, ask for them naked with Honey Thai coating and see if your not happy. More one thing they have a 2nd story outdoor patio that over looks the strip, full bar, TV's, food, this time of year its one special place that other locations don't have. Stop being closed minded and at least give Hooters a try then make up your mind."}
{"text":"Don't know where to start, they charged me $ 6 for a side salad, order the 10 boneless wings...I'm not a math genius but if they gave 7 pieces I'm been generous, my wife's fries cold and tasteless, never got offer a refill. They had only one girl serving the whole place and she did a good job but over all horrible experience and we are never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Hello, I went to this place yesterday to watch some college football this was the worst hooters experience I've ever had the service was Alright. The food was NASTY ass fuck the WATER taste like trash I told my server that my water taste nasty she said I know I don't drink that water I drink the bottle water did not offer me any and when I asked for a water she charged me SMH! But the food was disgusting I order a BYOB the ground beef taste like it had Been sitting for 2 or 3 days not fresh at all the fries were disgusting long story short I didn't finish my food and I love to eat OVERALL Zero I would never go back to this location and would not tell any of my coworkers or friends to go there."}
{"text":"We had a group reservation for the upper patio and special arrangements made for food and drink specials.  Apparently those didn't get communicated well to the staff serving us and then we found out that you can't have food up there, so they had to order \"take-out\" to deliver to us with plastic-ware and Styrofoam boxes -- and of course the wind was blowing so it made of a hassle.  They also couldn't provide us with the happy hour beer specials as originally promised to our group before we made the reservation.    I don't see us going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Hooters, we ordered the hooter platter $17.99 (BBQ boneless, habanero traditional- waitress got the sauce backwards even though she repeated the order maybe it was the cook! and the original shrimp was good). My husband ordered the (3) mahi fish taco $14.49 he was only able to eat 1 (Del taco much better) and I had the fish & chips $12.99 I had 1 bite & I was done, it tasted fishy & you can tell the oil they fried it in was old!   Our waitress was very nice.  It is a Saturday night 7PM only 2 tables with customers.   If I ever decide to have hooters I will stick to what they are known for Original Chicken Wings & that's all.   Thank you for reading"}
{"text":"Purchased Hooters original wings to go for golden knights party. Hooter wings are normally a treat. However once I got home and tried them they were terrible. They were dark and over cooked. Grease was likely old.   We called and reported the problem. Since a few were eaten Hooters would not refund. I returned the rest the following day to show them - and would hope they don't serve anything like that again."}
{"text":"I've been to Hooters all over Florida and this was the worst it could be. The staff was great, the place was new. But the wings, were horrible soaked in grease like when you place them in before it gets up to temp. They said the staff is new also. I don't think ill be back. And its too bad, my wife used to like to go to this companies restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to the new Hooters on Eastern the other day.  It was a quiet morning so it was perfect , not to noisy.  The deep fried pretzels and homemade cheese sauce is AMAZING.   As are the nachos.   My husband and 12 year old daughter had the chicken wings amd they said they were AMAZING. Strawberry lemonade was good as well.  KAYLEE our waitress was attentive. I even met a manager Ian , who made us laugh when he came over to check on us to see how our food was.  I played $40  poker at the bar , even though I didn't win  , I overheard another person say the machines have hit 4 or 5 jackpots since opening.  Between the Pretzels and cheese sauce and the Poker jackpots I will keep going back :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! I walked in & was never greeted! I sat at a table in the bar & set the timer on my phone after being ignored & Nobody even helped me for 17 minutes before I walked to the front & asked for the manager. He apologized & said he'd buy me a drink & get a server. Then a girl came over & said she'd be our server & be right back but never came back. I asked the bartender for a round of drinks & told her we wanted to order & still didn't have a server! The guy next to us was complaining & telling the manager he didn't know if he even had a waitress & had Nobody help him as well. After being there for a Game & being there a few hours I would never go here again! The girls were walking around spinning wet rags & snapping each other's ass & otherwise doing nothing. The manager was sitting at the bar chatting & not even helping. We sat & watched our drinks finally made & then were never brought out. Finally when our food was brought out it wasn't even our order!  Food took forever & was the worst I've ever had in a HOOTERS. WHEN 1 of the waitresses walked by, I told her we had terrible service & she said well look how busy we are! I'm sorry but I'm in the industry & I've seen bartenders with more tables than that! Competitive bars in the area were absolutely packed when we left & went to them & was given excellent customer service & didn't wait long at all. If anybody's in the area go anywhere but here!!! The bartender made it clear she's only been there a few weeks & she was definitely the hardest 1 working & sweetest 1 there & She was pregnant! This explains why everyone told me the service & quality of the food is terrible!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Our server kept disappearing for 20min at a time. Restaurant wasn't busy maybe 3-4 other tables... I think there were more servers than customers and still took a long time for service. I asked for my check and about 45 min later the server provided wrong checks, it was a big mess. By the end I was so annoyed I just wanted to leave. I don't understand why some serves refuse to write down orders especially with parties of 6+. We've been here before and experienced the wait but not this bad. We should have known, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went in at 830pm. Sat in the bar area.  Took 7 minutes for anyone to talk to us. Ordered 20 hooters style wings and a pitcher of beer. Wings had too much sauce. Had to ask the waitress for a plate. She never refilled our water glasses. Not a great experience, but I'm willing to try it again since this location just opened."}
{"text":"Customer service is trouble here.  I guess they think you don't need drinks when your eating hot wings......."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through GrubHub, who I give 5 stars for offering the service, sending promo codes & having an easy-to-order website.    Food & delivery was super quick & I was super hungry!!  It's been about 6 years since I've been to a Hooters & I always ordered the 911 boneless chicken tenders.  I ordered 10 piece boneless chicken, not knowing it would be like popcorn chicken from Buffalo Wild Wings.  I like Hooters for Hooters, if I want BWW I would've ordered from them.    Obviously, things have changed & that's fine as long as I can taste the chicken & it's as tasty as before.  The Habanero BBQ sauce was a nice sweet & spicy mix & the 911 sauce on the other 5 nuggets balanced the sauces out really well.  The 'popcorn' chicken was mostly bread & a huge chunk of sauce & bread drippings under the 911 chicken order.  Oh goodness gracious gross!  Even the ranch wasn't tasty.  I love ranch!  Did they change where they get their ranch from cause that's what compliments the 911 chicken & celery.    Online it asks if you want 'extra celery' when you order, but I didn't get any celery so not sure if I was supposed to.  I always have in the restaurant.    Overall, I thought I was getting tenders w/ celery, no worry if the nuggets were fulfilling & all pieces were full of chicken.   I was planning on starting my diet tomorrow so was going  out w/ a bang tonight... Guess not.  I'll have to wait til another cheat day to enjoy it.  Not fulfilled or impressed at all."}
{"text":"fried pickles were tasteless to thin and the boneless wings tasted like an old shoe tough like leather. this was the worst hooter I've ever been to"}
{"text":"This is the worst dining experience we have ever had. Food was cold, service was terrible. We could see out meals sitting under the food lamp for over 15 minutes before it was brought to us. Unfortunate because the locations in the SouthEast are far better. I hope the management gets this place under control."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is clean and u can tell daily new place. I had the tacos. The fries were raw I sent them back and they came back the same way.  Don't order the curly fries. They were friendly about returning the food but it was not good over all. I tried this place bc I had a Groupon. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The drinks are cheap and the bartenders AND managers are EPIC!!! Charlie, Kathy, Stephanie, Lindsey, and Seth are so nice. Rich and Ray are awesome managers. It's not nearly as fake as other Hooter's I have been to. They have a shit ton of TVs and they will put anything you want at least once. I would highly recommend this bar!  Not to mention the upstairs has a great view of the strip!!!"}
{"text":"I never been to Hooters so my husband took me. The place was empty which was ok. The food was ok, the service was decent and the atmosphere was ok. I did like the music they were playing thought. I would go back just to try different things in the menu."}
{"text":"Worst service of all of the hooters I have eaten at. To start we asked for a booth but was told it was reserved for larger groups but then took up to a table that sat the same amount as the booth. Then 15 mins in we flag down a waitress and tell her we have been here for 15 mins and still have not got our drinks ordered. She said one sec ill get your waitress, no sorry or ill go ahead and get the order for you. 10 Mins later we flag down who we didn't know at the time was our waitress and I state we have waited now 25 mins and still have not been asked our drink orders. Again there were no sorry or anything she just said I can take your drink order. We ordered our food at the same time for fear it would be another 25 mins just to get our order in. At the time we submitted our order our friend asked for his fries to be brought out asap because he was hungry. The waitress said okay. 10 mins later and no fries, my friend asked the waitress who was walking by about the fries and she said she would find our waitress. She comes back without our waitress and says the waitress said he didn't ask for his fries first. We all said he did and she even said okay when he asked. Our waitress comes to the table a few minutes later and gives some excuse saying they were short staffed and the manager today was a no-show. The funny thing is it seemed like it was just her that was neglecting us. The other waitresses were tending to their tables. No apologies for not putting in the order to have the fries come out first or the amount of time we have to wait to be serviced, nothing and to add more insult, when we asked about the memorial day special for veterans/military which was options of a free entree like the free 10 wings we were told her manager decided they were not going to offer the advertised deal and decided what he would offer is buy 10 wings get 10 wings free. No sorry about that or anything. Needless to say, we won't be spending our money at Hooters again."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I had the fish tacos that were excellent. Best that I've had in Vegas.  I had three large tacos AND curly fries. My server was, Lissa, is new to Hooter's but knew her stuff.  I ordered Ice Tea that was perfectly brewed. My lunch was a win,win,win situation.  I was invited back with a 15% discount on my next meal within 30days. I'll make sure to take them up on that offer."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer one afternoon. It was really quiet. I went to the bar to get a beer and was ignored by the bar tender which was weird. I quickly moved to a table and was served by a much nicer and attentive server. Overall it was pretty plain inside and not much going on here. Beer was cold and air conditioning was on so it was a beer and a quick exit."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe a dozen times or so since they opened (splitting time with the Hotel location). The atmosphere is not very overwhelming, it's generally not too busy (except for fight nights) and the bar area is well separated from the main dining hall which does sometimes lead to a wait for drinks, even if it isn't busy. I've never had an issue with the food, but the service can be slow (not cook time, order time) and on one occasion there was a single waitress for the whole restaurant (luckily, it was not busy). In fact, I can't recall seeing a member of the wait staff on more than one visit, perhaps due to the slower customer traffic, which is too bad because they're generally quite good (if you look past the speed). No drink specials on weekends is a bit foolish and certainly doesn't make me want to go and watch football and throw money away on alcohol for several hours. But if you're hungry,  it's still Hooters!"}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews but the service and food here was so bad that I feel the need to post this. Last night a group of us met up at Hooters to watch the late football game. At first our waitress (I think her name was Justine) was doing well and was coming back to check on us and ask if we needed anything else. Then towards the end of our visit she disappeared for 15-20 mins at a time. My friend was ready for her check but our waitress was nowhere to be found. I finally got tired of waiting and walked to the bar to ask the bartender to find the waitress for us. When she finally arrived she brought out one big check and we wanted separate checks. Then when she brought out the separate checks, half of them were completely wrong and It took her forever to figure out who ordered what. She charged my husbands CC for the correct bill but then came back and said that bill was already paid for and she needed to void it and charge a different amount. I was confused so I asked to see the new bill and it was $15 more than our original bill and we were charged for items that we didn't order. Then it took her another 15 mins to figure out what to do so we ended up having to ask for a manager. My husband was charged twice for two different amounts and we were told it will be fixed, now we just gotta wait to see what happens in our bank account. To make matters worse, My brother and his girlfriend had ordered wings and while eating them he said they didn't taste right and thinks they may have been raw. So I told him to stop eating them! This morning he texted me and said he felt sick and his girlfriend is throwing up.  I will NEVER come back to Hooters ever again! We have been to this location before and the service was \"meh\" but this time it was one of the worst I've ever seen."}
{"text":"I came here on opening day with some friends, and i think i fell in love. This hooters has their new modern look to it. And its pretty awesome. Rooftop bar too!!! Super cold beer. Deliciously hot food (beef \"bomb-ass\" philly) and some of the coolest hooter girls in america!! Def will be coming back here! Oh their sign outside is pretty sick. So happy there is a hoots on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Went there Monday night to watch the Raiders game !!  Great game go raiders !!! Met Courtney the bartender.  Not only was she super friendly but amazingly professional.  She was on top of her game and handling the entire bar with ease.   I witnessed her handling some very rude and difficult people. I personally would have kicked them out for their behavior. Not Courtney, she took on the challenge and handled them correctly and turning them into happy cool customers.  I ended up bullshitting with these peeps later and hey turned out to be pretty cool. Just frustrated in the beginning. But due to Courtney's control and customer service she not only earned them as Hooter customers but myself as well."}
{"text":"What a fantastic lunch and cocktail! Our server, Heather, was nice and helpful and made great food suggestions. Danny the manager came by to answer all our fantasy football questions and was a delight! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 15 piece boneless wings.  First of all they cost $17 these were micro sized boneless wings. KFC has bigger popcorn chicken for 1/4 the price. I ordered a side of sauce which they charged me for and then forgot to put it in the bag, they charge for extra pickles. This place is wayyyyy to over priced for what you get. This will be the last time I go to place I gave it a second chance but never again. Stay away from this location.   Another thing at Buffalo Wild Wings I can't even get close to finishing 10. These were so small I was still hungry after eating these hooters boneless wings."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the Worst $50 I've ever spent.  It was Wednesday so I was thinking hooters has great boneless wings... I was wrong.  Not only was it overpriced, but the wings were horrible, mostly just fried oil, the fries that came with the orders were cold and less than half the order.  They got all of the sauces wrong, and no one was there when I showed up to pick up the order.  Really?"}
{"text":"Best wings in town. I highly recommend the 3 mile island sauce, Mike the bartender is awesome!! Never had to ask for anything!!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new hooters. On the outside the building is quite impressive.  On the inside I hate the layout. A wall divides the restaurant due to smokers. Creates weird space. Doesn't have cool hooters vibe like those in Florida. Very sterile decorations. So took waitress 10min to take our order. Then chicken wings took 35 min. Ridiculous. Wish I could've liked this place cuz I like hooters but this new spot missed the mark big time."}
{"text":"Located off of Eastern, it's easy to spot their famous signage.  The dining area setup is like many of their other locations. Half booths and half high tops.  It wasn't very busy during lunchtime so we were seated immediately.    Unfortunately their service wasn't up to par.  Our waitress sat at another table chatting so her attentiveness to us was less than acceptable.  It seemed as if most of the waitresses during this time were sitting around and not taking care of the dining patrons.    On the positive side, Our meal was ok.  We ordered the pretzels and cheese to start.  They were pretty good! There were actually a lot of pretzels which started to fill me up quickly.  We split some hot wings as well.  They were good but a bit on the salty side.  Other Hooters locations have done better.    After all is said and done I wouldn't make this a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"What an experience, a journey that was progressively getting worst. We didn't even get the menu for 20 mins we got our Drinks about 20 mins after that. Food took maybe 45 min after the struggle of repeating the order .  Not sure what was so hard? The manager didn't care at all that my bill was incorrect . Just horrible. Will never come back ever!"}
{"text":"It's Hooters, so you know what you're getting going in haha. Decent bar food. Pretty good value for the money. Great for watching football (especially if you're a Patriots fan as this location is a Patriots bar). If you're watching the early morning games, try the sort of secret breakfast menue"}
{"text":"Great food...service is slow 98% of the time. One of the waitresses, Jasmine, is just awful. Has a bit of an attitude.  She's not your normal bubbly hooters girl. Slow, rude and could care less about working there and it shows in her attitude.  Vallory and Hannah and maybe one more are the only good waitresses there.  I've personally been told the waitresses are on there phones in the back, being slow on purpose.  They also refuse to do the Birthday stuff to customers.  They just all say they are under staffed to come out and help someone celebrate.  Hooters of Spring Valley is way better than this one.  They don't even wear the black outfits or military outfits because the manager is too cheap to buy them.  This Hooters used to have pizazz, but not anymore.  No wonder they are never busy.  This Hooters lacks all what Hooters is about.  The girls are rude most of the time, slow, and don't portray the flirty Hooters girl."}
{"text":"I just realized my review never posted from awhile ago so I stopped by here awhile ago and even though I was just there to make a to-go order, I had a great experience.  I was immediately welcomed by a man and one of the hooters girls and helped me with my order, even though it seemed like I had just interrupted them. The girl who took my order was very nice and even gave me a bit of a deal with my order.  And while I waited for my order (which did not take long at all), another girl came over and asked if I was being helped, as soon as she saw me. Definitely great customer service! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My friend and I rolled into Hooters around 3am. We weren't  sure if it was even open because there was NO ONE in there at all. No one besides Chuck, our server! Probably one of my favorite Hooters experiences ever. The food came out fresh and hot, Chuck chatted with us and made sure everything was good, and it was kind of nice being the only people in the restaurant. Super cool!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if it was an option.   Arrived and sat in the bar. There was one table of 3 people. After 15 minutes of sitting at the table, the hostess came by with menus and said, \"I will send your server over\".  Well, thank you for taking my drink order.  Five minutes later the waitress arrived and took our drink order.  A full thirty minutes after arriving, the waitress finally came back and took our food order.    Our food arrived around 10 minutes later. The nachos were cold, there was a melon scoop of guacamole and sour cream and barely any chili or cheese. The bowl of chili my friend ordered was half full. I left one third of the chips of my nachos uneaten as they were naked; the chili, cheese sauce, guacamole and sour cream were already gone.   The topper was the fact that our dirty plates sat on the table for 45 minutes before my friend actually got up and took them to the bar herself. Both managers and several waitresses passed by our table empty-handed and did not pick up the dishes.   A conversation with the manager, Pepe, was less than satisfactory. It was obvious that the lack of service during this time frame started at the top and trickled down to every employee.   The menu is as limited as the service.  Apparently, they stay in business due to the short shorts and tight, low-cut tank tops the waitresses wear.  It surely has nothing to do with the quality of the food or the non-existent service."}
{"text":"We had wings and a salad the salad was with made with Romaine lettuce and there is a E coli threat with Romaine lettuce right now so we were concerned with where the lettuce with came from. The waitress said she would ask the cook and when she come back she said the cook said some guy delivers it. They didn't know where they got the Romaine from. We sent it back, didn't want to take a chance and get e-coli. However, the boneless wings were very good. And it is a great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Food was below par. Friendly waitress. I was disappointed with my wings. They were cold and took awhile to come out. Beautiful bar area. Bartenders were not attentive. Took awhile to get a second drink."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday, waitress paid very little attention, just took my order and the food came in a timely manner. Never checked in me and never asked if I wanted anything else. Was more concerned with her cell phone then working. Along with another waitress that was next to her.  This location was ok nothing special."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service!!! We came here to watch the college basketball championship. We called ahead and realized after we got there why the place was empty. There were 3 waitresses in the restaurant that all seemed to disappear when you needed something. We ordered our food and it took forever to come out. My friend's order came out wrong and it took another 40 min to get another order of wings. We will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great beer selection, can't beat the Daytona wings and of course those Hooter Girls"}
{"text":"Wings, beer, sports, can't go wrong unless you get stuck at the bar with Adina, what a ball buster. Natalie is a sweetheart , such a nice smile.We ordered way too much food but that's what drinking does to you. Can't wait to go back and see how much hell Adina gives me for this yelp, it's all good, we had a blast."}
{"text":"This is such a great bar! The staff is extremely friendly, the food is great, the prices are good, & the machines pay out!! The owner even stopped and said hello and Kim is such a laid back & funny guy! This is my favorite spot to go to relax and win some money on my lunch break! The bartenders are always awesome, sweet, & funny! Everyone makes me feel right at home! I LOVE this bar!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I walked in to Hooters on Easter at 10:45 and there was no one behind the bar for the next 10 minutes when the gentleman came to take my water he was very friendly and took care of me while I was sitting there about 1125 the night manager who is wearing an orange T-shirt brat I waitress in and they had a disagreement conference sitting right next to me I really don't think sitting at the bar next to customers is the place to have a meeting with one of you employees about her disagreement on how waitresses are let go at night I felt disrespected by the manager and it ruined my experience. OK SO I've given this place my last chance. NEVER NEVER NEVER will I come back here, now they allow cigar smoking. Probably because nobody else is coming in. Very crappy management at this place REPLACE QUICKLY or this will be closing."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new Hooters location. It took over the building from another bar/restaurant/gaming establishment. It's clean. The booths in the bar area are comfy and nice. The server was friendly, but she didn't know the different beer options and didn't seem familiar with the menu. Their uniforms also looked a bit sloppy. And when I said I wanted both ranch and blue cheese for the dipping sauces, I got one sauce cup with both ranch and blue cheese in it. (Is that a thing? I've never had that happen elsewhere before.) I was pleasantly surprised with the food as it was far better than the one other Hooters location I went to years ago. FAR better. I now think of Hooters very differently. The wing sauces are actually hot and spicy. The breaded wings (which were a complete icky, inedible disaster the one time I went to a different Hooters) were cooked perfectly. They had a good crunch and were well-coated in the sauce. Tip: The spicy garlic sauce is a real winner. The Daytona wings were good (unbreaded and grilled), but the sauce was too mild and BBQ-ish for me. The fries were cooked perfectly. The cheese sauce was good. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces left something to be desired, but weren't terrible. The original (breaded) wings and fries were a big hit - and they earn this place 4 stars. Plus, we were checked on frequently by both our server and a manager-type. So all in all, I'm kind of a fan of Hooters now. Those were some tasty wings."}
{"text":"I went to this Hooters location, after I had spoken with Owen S., the Manager, General Manager or one of the big dogs at this location about placing an order and he executed it beautifully.    He was running the front and also handling other tasks seamlessly despite being understaffed.  I sense that he was because of the lack of waiters or hostesses to take care of new customers that came in after I did.  However, I did not know that in the beginning when speaking with him and upon entering the restaurant.  Excellent Job,  Mr. Owen S.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is my third review for Hooters on Eastern. We went down there today for some wings and beers and it was almost as if we were at a different restaurant. The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable. We had the buffalo shrimp with some boneless and traditional wings. The shrimp was amazing and our wings were made just right. I can't thank Ray enough for being such a great manager and allowing us to give this place another shot and enjoy every second of it. We love coming here will most definitely be back again very soon! Thank you Hooters team!!!"}
{"text":"Henderson location. Worst. Ever. TWICE I've come across town specially wanting to enjoy the patio view (loved the previous ownership for the patio, they knew how to capitalize on their view)  1st time they were OVER charging for the patio because it was a fight night (wasn't there for that and could care less) extra $20 a person. No thank you.  2nd time (tonight) Arrived at 5pm, we were told the patio is closed because they don't have a bartender. Really????? You don't have a bartender? Yet ALL the Tvs are on and you have huge banners saying \"enjoy our patio, opens at 3:00pm\"  Poor management, these are rookie errors....cause the food isn't that great to carry you."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this location on Eastern Ave. and I can honestly say that I will never intentionally be a repeat customer.  The place was pretty much dead, so you would think you would receive decent service.  Well I was wrong!  I believe our waitress had a name tag that said Tammy though I might be mistaken.  Here is a pointer Tammy.  When you see the table needs refills on their drinks and you say that you will be right back with them.  You don't return with only 2/3 of the drinks which were for the teenagers and make the adult who is paying the bill wait 15 minutes before coming back to the table and offering to return with a refill the next time you come by.  This is poor customer service and the reason you will be receiving the minuscule tip that I left.  You might as well turn in your uniform as go work at McDonalds with the customer skills you're putting out there."}
{"text":"My review is solely based on the wings, as I'm addicted to them. I have only ordered their food for delivery (don't really wanna tote my 3 small children to eat at Hooters) so I can't comment on the restaurant or the service. The food I have delivered is always on par."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for drinks and wings. From the moment I walked in the entire staff was smiling and friendly. The food was good, the restaurant very clean, and all the staff clearly enjoyed their jobs. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I walked into an empty restaurant and passed a girl coming out of the bathroom just as I was going in. I was stopping over to this location to pick up lunch for the office. On our list was Hooters buffalo chicken salad, 24 buffalo shrimp, and deep fried pickles with a tea.   I returned and stood over by the empty greeters stand. I was passed by a gentleman who smiled and left. I don't think he worked there. I pulled out my phone to do a Yelp checkin and spotted a couple to the very back of the restaurant. I still didn't see any staff though.   The place was decorated like a Myrtle Beach sports bar, and even though empty, the atmosphere vibed fun. A young lady emerged through the interior sidedoor with a big smile and my bags of food. She rang my order and gave me a 10% Facebook page discount.   With 24 shrimp for around $20 I thought they were going to be huge. Not the case. They were medium size shrimp and enough for an adult and child to split without sides, but not two adults. The fried pickles were crispy with almost a cornbread type coating like you'd find on catfish. It was moist and salty inside and a little weird. That is until I dipped them in the accompanying spicy sauce. At that point they became awesome. There is more than enough for two adults to split unless you plan to make a meal of them. The salad appeared fresh and the portion was plentiful. You could specify the temperature and type of sauce you'd like on both the chicken and the shrimp.   I imagine the place livens up at night? There really should be a greeter at the stand by the door regardless. That was my first impression of the place, and with nothing else to draw from I would assume they were in trouble from the lack of patrons and hospitality. The food was quite good. I would absolutely do takeout again."}
{"text":"First time at this location!!  Service- Better then their other locations. We where politely greeted when entering in and seated comfortably to a booth of our choice.  Food- Happy Hour from 3-6p!!! Their drink menu for Happy Hour was decent as for the appetizers it's on a selected few. Decent portions and overall worth it!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This location has been open since the beginning of April, so I thought about 6 weeks was enough to work out any issues a new restaurant might have. I may have to give them a few more.   Food tastes great. Hot and up to Hooters standards. Getting the food out in a timely manner was a different story. They weren't busy by any standards. Maybe 5 tables in the restaurant side and maybe 10-12 people in the bar. We ordered an appetizer, wings and fries. Appetizer took a good 15 minutes to arrive. Was very flavorful (Southwest Eggrolls). The wings and fries took 35+ minutes from when we ordered. Even if it was cook to order, just a bit long.   As always at Hooters, waitresses were friendly and attentive.  I hope the kitchen staff gets it together."}
{"text":"Great beer, marginal food, nice scenery. Lindsay the bartender is very nice and attentive. She's the rock holding this place together."}
{"text":"Their outside neon and entry says 24/7 gaming.  They close at midnight and there are no machines. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Really Hooters... A $20 cover charge per person because you chose to show  the UFC fight. I came to eat food not watch UFC. You're a restarurant. Thanks for wasting our time. We won't be back."}
{"text":"To the manager of this location, remember that first impressions last and it was my fault coming back here a 2nd time to actually dine in. 1st time I called in a pretty large to go order for 6 people. I walk in, no one greets me (around 7pm). I finally get attention, I pay, 15 mins later the waitress gives me a small bag?? I ask is this my full order? She said ya... And then I ask are you sure cuz this small box isn't $80 worth of food. She looks at it dumb founded. 10 mins later I finally got it and got home it was all cold?!?  2nd visit I walk in around 9, not busy at all and no one greets us.  All I hear are waitresses in the back (eating) and yelling at the one with her back towards me saying front door even tho she couldn't hear them. 1 more awkward minute, they yell at her again and with anger she yells \"WHAT\" then she notices us and she stomps past us, no eye contact, and grabs menu and then ask us to be seated... Ok. The restaurant is empty in the non smoking and I just see two waitress' in the back corner eating, and being obnoxious...  Food was ok but not up to the Hooters I've had elsewhere before... Conclusion, I now know why a hooters restaurant is empty. The service is just awful and seems like all the hooters rejects work here."}
{"text":"As a former Hooters Girl and pioneer Hooters Casino girl, this is a great place! I have eaten here quite a few times and each visit has been great. The girls are friendly and knowledgeable of their jobs & the menu. And I have taken a particular liking to the buffalo shrimp and Chesapeake bay wings. I actually have to drag my fiance here when I get the cravings.  And one day, I will venture into that bar area and play me some Keno!"}
{"text":"So, I eat at Hooters on a semi regular basis. Mostly because I keep thinking one time I'll have success. Usually what happens is I think chicken wings sound delicious and that were go to Hooters for the wings, and then I leave Hooters mad at myself because I feel like crap, the service was nonexistent, the food was terrible, and it was so overpriced. Ok obviously I'm not a guy going to see chicks running around in short shorts, so yes, I'm judging Hooters as I would a non Breastaurant.   But...here's the thing. I left this Hooters happy and without gastrointestinal distress. Our server was attentive, and not in that annoying, I work for tips, giggle at everything, and draw hearts on your receipt kind of way. Like actual service. Like refill your drink promptly, and get hot food out promptly.  I actually wrote a little note on the receipt for our server letting her know it was the best Hooters experience I've ever had. Yea I know, so I guess I kinda have a different set of standards for Hooters, but I really was happy with my experience and this location is very clean and nice.   So thank you for restoring my faith in Hooters. Thank you for giving me a positive experience. And thank you for not giving us poor service just because  there is a girl in the crowd. We tip just as good when deserved, but dotting the I in your name with a heart isn't gonna do it for me."}
{"text":"Been having hooter wings for years now definitely the best wings anywhere. So happy for this new location right around the corner from where I live.  2nd time here and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Visited this location today with my mom and we were pleased with the food and hostess. Bree (or Brea) was extremely nice and attentive. She was super friendly and made sure we were good throughout our visit. The food was amazing... as per usual and we were happy with her professionalism! Thank you B!"}
{"text":"Will never eat there again, my son got the kids chicken fingers and now has food poisoning. Would not recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"Love it. Great service. Came here for dinner on Friday night. Yasmin was our server and she did a great job. She was very polite, and she answered all our questions. I got a dozen oysters on a half shell, and they tasted fresh. My daughter got an order of the traditional wings with the\" 911\" sauce and they were great as well. Finished off with a slice of peanut butter pie which tasted amazing. Gets 5 stars because service, food, atmosphere, everything was great."}
{"text":"Absolute disappointment....  I think there is a leadership problem at this business. None of the employees have any sense of urgency to help anyone including each other. You would think people working for tips as a primary part of their income would be more eager to provide good (at least adequate) service however this not the case at this location. Maybe the manager should make their rounds, get out of wherever they are hiding and start checking on how things are going for their patrons. You might learn why your restaurant is a ghost town at dinner time.  I won't totally bash the place, at least when the food finally did arrive it was hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Stop in here for lunch on a regular basis. Beer is always so tasty and cold, food is always so fresh and hot, everything is perfect every time. The servers are the best and the most friendliest I have seen. I am asked every single time by multiple people from the hostess to the general manager if my experience is great and everything meets my standards. I would bring friends from out of town here for a casual friendly dining experience. Ignore any negative reviews this place is stand up."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Dropped in to watch playoff game and have some food. Arrived and the place was dead. Seated near glass partition in dining area looking into the bar. Server arrived timely, ordered drinks. After ordering drinks started looking around and saw the booth I was in was dirty. Piece of chicken breading on glass partition window sill. Gross liquid spilled on the wall, lots of greasy fingerprints on glass, general  crude. Since was there to watch a game decided to risk it and order some food, seems to me you can't go to wrong with bar food. Ordered an appetizer and server brought metal plates for sharing, freezing cold plates that had been laying out somewhere. Sliders arrived and what a disappointment. Non descript and bland, $11.00 !!! Left after that.. What a bust. Lousy management, lousy food and overpriced. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Well today is Cinco De Mayo and I intended to enjoy some patio time with my wife. For one they've had a banner outside since it changed from Half Shell that advertises patio bar open at 3pm. Yet we show up today and it's a ghost town bar not set up, everything off at 5:10pm. We left irritated and called to speak with the \"manager\" Danny. Who gave half ass excuses for why it wasn't open (said worker couldn't find babysitter) however there was 3 girls screwing around the podium downstairs while one was out front using the phone. The only person who had business was the bartender inside and that was 3 ppl. Honestly I've never seen such a pathetic use of space in Vegas until here. Poorly managed, clueless workers, who help themselves to drinks behind the bar....I could go on, but id be writing essay. Go see for yourself. It's sad because this patio is AMAZING and could be such a great spot to kick it with friends."}
{"text":"Went downhill, food sucked and service was the worst! Our server was in the weeds the whole time with 3 tables. She thought Guinness beer was an IPA and the other servers had to bring out food because she was freaking out. I have know idea how they are still open.  Total fail on al levels"}
{"text":"My food wasn't great but Tiffany who wasn't even my waitress was so amazing and personable. Great customer service like that is hard to come across!"}
{"text":"Kind of surprised at how few customers there were at this location. The entrees were decent enough, but the curly fries were meh. Service was adequte."}
{"text":"We came in for a quick lunch, had excellent service . The food was fantastic! We ended up playing a full size Jenga game on the roof top. It was fun...  Donald the manager was so friendly as he welcomed us for a first time it was good yeah"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the whole Hooters experience was ruined. I love Hooters but not sure if I will go back to this one even though it is close."}
{"text":"Not the hooters experience I remember, been to several around the country.  the chicken could not have been more saturated with grease and was tasteless....the fries were cold, not fresh.  certainly a regrettable meal experience.   I  would not bother with this place"}
{"text":"I am definitely a happy camper when it came to my experience last night!  The service was on par where we had no substantial waits between ordering drinks, apps, and our main course. Even though we didn't come for specials, our waitress made sure we got every deal that could apply!  So we got 10 wings and a 10 free for each person at the table. We had no issue getting 2 sauces per 10 wings. I think I might be a traditionalist, because I loved the regular hot sauce. My main thought is that the wings (which were boneless) were way too small to be enough to feed me. Good thing we got sides, buffalo chicken dip and the free fried pickles (with checkin offer).  Here is some tidbits. The flavored tea is about $4 a glass and the glass is small and mostly filled with ice. The flavoring made the tea really foamy and kind of disturbed me. However, it tasted good, but No Refills. However, the menu made it seem like it came with refills.  The waiter was cool. She let us take our time and didn't ever rush us. The overall experience was something that leads me to believe I could be a regular.  My only wish is that the boneless wings were a bit bigger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here for the first time recently. There was a sporting event going on so the restaurant was somewhat crowded but not too bad. There were a ton of TVs so everyone could have a good view which was really great. Unfortunately, the lack of staff and service on a big sports night was really sad. It took forever for us to get any service and it took a very long time for our food to show up, especially since they were just onion rings. The poor girl who was serving us seemed so stressed out and overwhelmed. There seems to be no sound absorbing anything anywhere because the restaurant was so damn loud I could barely hear anything. I did however hear the unruly drunk guy in the booth next to me who was disturbing an entire section of the restaurant and I was surprised that they were still serving him. Did not have a very good experience. I might give it another shot in the future but for now, nope."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here during a Vegas Golden Knights game on May 16th.  The service was beyond horrible, and the restaurant appeared to only have about half of the staff needed to service the (small) demand in their dining room.  What made matters worse is both my wife and I have tried to reach out via the contacts on the Hooters website and haven't heard back.  We won't be returning to this location, in part due to the service, and in part because nobody seemed to care when we raised concerns after our visit."}
{"text":"Typical Hooters. Plain, nothing wild on the walls. The food is what it is. The girls are in the same 80's gym shorts."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Sunday afternoon lead us to Hooters on Eastern Ave.  They have Mt. Dew and wings wrapped in bacon!  What more do you need!?  The bar area has lots of TVs to watch sports, and service is always good.  Even the non-bar area has several TVs.  Food is always consistently good - but today they were out of Key Lime Pie!!!  Oh the humanity!!!!  The chocolate mousse cake is good - but I love the key lime pie.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Well. Let me start by saying that my first visit must have been a fluke. My family and I went again last night and all I can say is that everything was perfect! With appetizers, side dishes, Multiple various drinks and all different entrees..... Everything was just as we ordered. We met several of the staff members (Ian, Robert and Charlie) and it seems like they just want to be proud of where they work and it shows because they are doing a great job. Oh, I don't remember her name but our waitress was great. Checked on us frequently to be sure all was well but not enough to disturb us. So, with all of that being said, I encourage you to visit the find people and food at Hooters Eastern. If you have questions, complaints or compliments, don't be shy.... They aim to please.  Tip: if it says spicy. It probably is!  HA!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience eating out that I have ever had. 5 of us came here because the Buffalo Wild Wings was at capacity for the Stanley Cup game, so we came here.  1. It took 15 minutes for a server to realize we hadn't been helped and to take our order, after that it took 15-20 minutes to get our drinks (after I told the manager we have been waiting.)  2. Finally get our food, but they gave me bone-in Wings when I asked for boneless and she said it might take awhile for it to come out (like she wanted me to say no it's okay I'll eat these wings.)  3. A few minutes later a different girl comes out, and she tossed the wings at me and walked away.  4. My friends ordered 2 salad appetizers, and didn't get it till after our meals were there.  5. We had to ask the manager for utensils. 6. Not that this matters but I'll just add that our servers name tag was upside down, we just kept noticing so much wrong with this place. 7. Finally, we paid, but the girl never came and picked up our checks. So we had to take it to the manager and he charged my friends card $30 when she got one thing for about $12. So then she had to go get that fixed.  Overall, stay away from this place, the manager could care less what is going on and is no help at all and sags his pants. The service is slow and unprofessional. I understand you may be busy, but with as many people that I saw working, the service shouldn't be that poor. I had just been over at Buffalo Wild Wings and they were on their A game. I wish I had just stayed there and waited an hour for my seat, and if they mess up they give you a discount. Not that I'm looking for a free meal, but this manager could care less about the service, or making customers happy! They deserved no tip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a couple of drinks and a quick bite to eat. Our waitresses name was victoria. She was very cute and friendly. She made suggestions on appetizers as well as the different sauces for wings. Food came out quickly and she was great about refilling waters and doing check backs. We had nachos,  boneless wings,  a chicken sandwich and a burger as well as fries and onion rings. Everything was great,  portion size very good also. We live near by and will definitely be back. Can't wait for them to get their 24hr gaming going so we can drink and play."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed today been coming here since it opened. Today we ordered a Diet Coke and ice tea and it tasted disgusting!! Like chemicals and we told our server Allie and she just responded that they get a lot of complains but that is how it tasted. Which is not true because we have never tasted that nastiness before. Then to top it off we order our food buffalo shrimp cold and we asked for extra crispy naked wings and they were not crispy and just ok. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here looking for a drink and some bar food on a Friday night. We weren't told about any specials, and we had to ask for them. The service was terrible and the specials were very overpriced. The service was so terrible we actually ended up leaving and going else wear. There are too many good places on Eastern to eat somewhere not fabulous..."}
{"text":"First time at this location,  and second time to Hooters in general.  Sat at the bar with my brother and had Sammy for a bartender. It was her first night.  She was great! The food was fresh and delicious.  We had the pretzel sticks with beer cheese,  nachos and original wings.  It took awhile for the wings but they made up for it with quality customer service.  Plus it gave time for the other food to digest.  4 stars only because of the wait time for wings.  I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place is always empty. Such a beautiful bar and restaurant. The food is always cooked proper, and the service is always \"pretty\" decent. We will continue to get our wing fix here."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this particular Hooters and after visiting, I clearly see why it was offered. My friends & I decided to come after we left the pool. When we arrived, we were not greeted for about 5 minutes even though there was a host. The server was nice but she was very forgetful. One of my friends is allergic to onions and specifically ask if the entree she ordered could have it without it. When the food arrived, her order has onions and my other friend ordered sliders but half of them were wrong. I ordered Buffalo Shrimp which was not hot when it was brought out and the shrimp was very mushy. The one good thing I can about this location is that the fries were very good (but you can fries from anywhere) and the music was good. I would not recommend this location to anyone and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Oh my, this place is a disaster. It's a wonder the health department doesn't shut them down. My  boyfriend and I were looking for a place with outdoor seating and decided to give this place a try. First they got our drink order wrong, but not wanting to waste good booze we said we'd drink it. Then we noticed the dried chicken bones and other food on the floor. Three waitresses walked by and kicked the bones under the table  My boyfriend and I looked at each other and cracked up. So did the party next to us. So appalling  Its too bad because the Anthem area doesn't have a lot of restaurants with outdoor seating. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"For those of you who want a fun place to have your Fantasy Football Draft, give this place some serious consideration.    Had our fantasy football draft here, Nicole was our server.  To put it simply, this girl was awesome!!  She made the 12 of us feel right at home and wasn't afraid to mix it up and get in all of the action.  Pitchers of beer were flowing along with tons of wings.  Who doesn't love freshly cooked chicken wings?  We sat in the bar section.  The dining room and bar were separated by a glass enclosure.  We did not get to go up on the patio, but it seems like a cool place to hangout.  Hooter's provided us with an entire draft kit and there is Free WiFi.  A great time was had by all as the entire staff was friendly and accommodating to our rowdy group.    If i lived on that side of town, I'd hit up this Hooter's more often.  I think it is better than the one on Rainbow in the Southwest part of town."}
{"text":"I must say the reason I gave a 5 star rating is because of the graveyard bartender named Michael.  Every Friday night I get off work and need to relax, have a cold drink or two, release some steam and enjoy a good burger, and he does it all. Michael is always in a great mood and greets me with a smile on his face, ready and willing to serve me, even when I first started coming and had know idea what I wanted/liked.  Michael isvery knowledgeable of the menu and able to answer any question I have had.  His skill behind the bar is unbelievable. His knowledge of beers  is amazing and pointed me in the right direction.  Stop by and see him on Friday nights and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This location is close to my house so we usually stop in to grab a bite. The staff is always friendly and the service has always been good.  Not a big of fan of Hooters food in general  as to why only a couple of stars. The traditional wings and chicken sandwich are good. Other then that I've never really had anything hit the spot."}
{"text":"So we decided to go have wings at Hooters which is our favorite place to go for wings and beer.  Well we sat ourselves and waited for our waitress which took awhile , mean time a manager was taking care of the table behind us. He turns and tells us he will be right back never came back so about another 15 minutes pass and a waitress ask has nobody help you yet.  After still waiting for 10 minutes she came back and took our order of wings and drinks.  We get our food short 2 orders of fries which we had to ask for and still no fries we the told the waitress only get us 1 order, we were done with our food when the last order of fries showed up. My wife order a bud light with 2 limes it showed up when we had eaten more the half of our meal and then no limes.  We love this place get more help or put people in there that can handle the business please.   Went back again table broken and dirty. Menus were sticky.  Waited for a drink then had to wait for our order to be taken.  The restaurant was very warm it felt like the air was not on. No one likes to sit down and eat when it's hot inside. What's going on your help is bad your managers aren't doing their job.  Looks like we will go elsewhere to eat wings."}
{"text":"I gave this location one more try........there was a woman and her son,  a male in the regular dining room in the bar a couple of older gentlemen in the bar. I thought I was in ghost town...one hooter girl trying so hard to get a couple bucks for a tip from a guy visiting from Mexico...No acknowledgement so left...will go to Miller's Ale where I don't have to be a man to get someone to notice me."}
{"text":"I will never be back to this location.  I was very excited about trying this location out as it is new and college football was on.. Boy do I regret it.  We sat in the bar which was very smokey although you can't really tell after you've been inside for a while.  It took a fair amount of time to get a server and then I ordered 10 bone in wings with Medium sauce.  My friend ordered the chicken salad.  My wings came out with NO sauce on them and the server said \"our sauce is water based so you can't really see it\".. Umm no there was NO sauce on them at all.. They were dry.  Then she took them back and brought them back and it seemed as though there wasn't medium sauce on them but rather that they were tossed in grease.  I eat wings a lot and I had to go through 5 or more paper towels due to the amount of grease on these wings.  Since when are wings supposed to be greasy?  I was so disgusted I was going to order a beer but we decided to go elsewhere.  My friend said the salad was McDonalds quality.  I understand Hooters isn't any upscale restaurant but come on.. I shouldn't feel absolutely disgusting and gross because I basically just are grease for dinner!"}
{"text":"By far the best service of any hooters I've ever been to I had beautiful blond waitress named Christa help me if you come to the hooters on Easter and ask for Christa she looks like she should be on the cover of the Victoria secret magazine! And don't forget the order there famous wings!!!"}
{"text":"Upstairs seating is tops, just try and beat this view at any bar in Las Vegas! And cone on its goers now, gotta love it. Though there is some dude bartender today! Meh."}
{"text":"The new hang out place for gals and guys is Hooters on Eastern in Henderson. The wings are the Best and service is awesome! This experience has been better than Twin Peaks! Rooftop Strip View!"}
{"text":"Great location if they can make it work. Having the upstairs deck area is a big plus.   The Good....The food is decent, much better new menu. Nice variety of sandwiches and wing flavors. Wings are big. The service has been good and the waitresses friendly so far.   The Bad....Very sweet of them to include the sauce considering they charge you $11 for 10 wings, the sauce is too small and if you order another \"small\" sauce it's like $1.19??? Management, I am paying $11 for 10 wings, either make the sauce that comes with it bigger or don't charge for 2nds. These days wings usually come with blue cheese and celery anyways, at least they do at Twin Peaks down the street and if I order all drums at Twin Peaks, they don't up charge me $1 like Hooters does.  Just hate being nickel and dimed. If I want wings I just go to Twin Peaks now. The parking can suck.   Could be a place I visit 1-2 times a week but will be more like 1 time a month."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for change the receipt because who doesn't get a receipt when dining out and I knew that waitress just trying to hijack my change because I'm not going to tip $10 on a $30 meal Well maybe if she smiled more we would have  Not to mention she couldn't count I gave coins so I would get back a solid 10$ and she brought me 9$ She can keep the 89 cents as a tip then if your gonna think your smart..  SHADY don't go here Shady shady shady Oh and perhaps the girl hanging out by the register should get off her dang phone"}
{"text":"HOLY CHRISTMAS! The worst! We just went in and had to rush out prior to 6:30 because of a UFC event if we didn't want to pay the $10.00 per person cover charge.   We ordered 20 wings (15 hot, 5 plain) we got 5 plain and 7 hot then we got 6 more and had to ask for the other 2.   A beer is $7.75 in a plastic cup maybe 22oz.   We ordered the new pretzel with beer cheese (the pretzel is like regular bread) a salad, 20 wings, kids chicken fingers with ranch and got a total of 3 ranches.   You pay anything extra $1.09 for a ranch or side of sauce.  4 beers and the food we ordered was $94.00.  We got completely rushed so when 6:30 came we left with maybe 30% occupancy! 70% of the tables were open!  I don't normally review places this place is a JOKE!"}
{"text":"Just to be clear: the only comments made about Diana were in regards to her terrible service. After mixing up our drink orders, then our food orders, and having to be flagged down as she zipped around serving everyone but us on a clearly slow night, it's to be expected. If we made her so uncomfortable, she made no effort to get us out of there faster. It took nearly 20 minutes to get our bill!  Additionally, my 60 year old mother and my brother's girlfriend were in attendance that night, and they certainly would have had an opinion if anyone was objectifying the staff in anyway.   But all this is moot. Your ignorant and heavy-handed response to my review only makes my decision to never eat the generic, flavorless food and deal with the awful service that much easier."}
{"text":"This Hooters was AWFUL!! We went on a Saturday night in vegas, with kids. It was empty but that didn't stop it from taking 5 minutes to be acknowledged and 5 more to be sat in an EMPTY restaurant. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. We got our apps pretty quickly after ordering our food but then our wings and sliders took AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES. We ordered a kids hotdog and we're told after all this time and the delivery of our food finally that the kitchen was out of hotdogs. The waitress got multiple parts of our order wrong and some of the food looked like it had been sitting for a while. Seemed to be this particular waitress as there were parties sat after and fed before us. Not amused at all. Don't go here."}
{"text":"We went here as part of a Groupon voucher we had, service was fantastic and food was great as well. We were happy overall and would be back again."}
{"text":"I was just charged to come into this bar just because a fight was playing. The girls at the front couldn't even pronounce the names of the fighters? Let alone there is maybe ten people in here. This bar is dead and you want to charge me to even come inside? Looks like y'all need my money to survive right now. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever.  First, no one was at the front on a Friday night.  This may explain why half the tables were filled.  As a result, I was wondering how long we had to wait for a seat.  Second, the service was bad.  For example, we had to ask for plates.  Third, the food was not up to par.  For instance, the wings seemed tough.  Hence, I agree with previous reviews: they need more servers because we observed 2 girls on the floor.  Finally, out of all the Hooters I visited, this was the worst ever.  Never again."}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson and have never been to Hooters so I thought I would check it out and watch the Knights game. The bartender was incredibly rude. He made me feel really uncomfortable and told me I couldnt order a drink at the bar because I wasnt sitting at the bar. When the guy next to me offered me his seat the bartender proceeded to tell me that I couldnt sit at the bar if I wasnt playing. I pointed out that NO ONE at the bar was playing and then he said of someone wanted to play a machine I would have to give up my chair.... DUH! I felt like he was being incredibly racist at this point considering everyone else at the bar was white. After talking it out a little longer he finally served me a beer without saying one more word to me. A beer and a shot = 18.13. Not only did I grossly overpay but I was left with nothing but anger and embarrassment. What a shitty experience. Terrible customer service and way too expensive for what I had to go through for a fucking beer!  Update. To make things worse. I decide to play a little and a guy comes up next to me to order a beer from the female bartender and no questions asked. It makes me realize how awful the service is here if you aren't white. No menu offered, no refill offered....just ignored. They need better bartenders here. I can't believe what I'm experiencing.  Update. Ordered the same beer from the female bartender. She charges me $4 not $8 like the other guy. SMH. He truly is an asshole."}
{"text":"Visited last week late in the evening. we were STARVING.  we confused the waitress a bit and my meal was screwed up.   the manager was perfect.  he really took care of us and I could hear him in the kitchen being extremely efficient.  food was delicious, servers were looking good, and management was on point (:"}
{"text":"came to hooters and Savanah was super nice. when someone said we couldn't go upstairs, Savanah let us upstairs and worked her butt off to help us out. we would return just for her service no joke! food was good also... ask for her guys!"}
{"text":"Had one of the worst salads at this Hooters in my life fall 2016. It was a disaster of a taco salad. The \"meat\" was cat food consistency and flavor. There was not much lettuce and the \"meat\" was piled on a few cheap plain whole tortilla chips. This was a big dissapointing salad. It is a great contrast to one of the best Cobb salads I'd ever had at the other main Hooters a few years back. I used to love going to this location back when it was Half Shell due to the menu and view. I had hoped they would at least have good food now that it's a Hooters. I've been three or four times to this Hooters location since it opened.  Follow my advise, stick to the wings. They give you metal wings plates no matter what you order for a reason. That's what they focus on. On the bright side, the service was good because it was empty."}
{"text":"I like the servers and think the girls are very personable. But when it comes to the cleanliness of the restaurant let me say I'll never return. I've been in several times and there's always hair in my wings when they come out. Not to mention seeing multiple bugs not only in my area but over hearing them talking about bugs in the kitchen! Ew. Never coming back and don't suggest you to either if you don't want bug infested kitchen food."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience i have ever had at any hooters and mind you ive been to the one in long beach california orange county the hooters on tropicana and then this one on eastern. Awful experience. The bathroom was filthy. No toilet paper or liners in any of the stalls which should not have been an issue since it was middle of the day and there were only 3 customers in the restaurant. I always say if you want to know how clean someone keeps their home look in their bathroom. If their bathroom was this dirty i can only imagine how dirty their kitchen was. Our waitress was mediocre. A good server shouldnt wait to ask if their table needs anything they should be observant fill our drinks make sure we have everything we need. She spent more time on her phone than tending to her tables. Food was ok ..seemed kinda cold like it had been sitting their for a minute. I definitely wont come to this location ever again. They do not live up to the hooters name nor provide the hooters experience."}
{"text":"Service was slow and made you feel like hurry up and eat so they can turn the table over. We did go during lunch hour and it was really crowded. They do have the best crispy hot wings though. We had fun and that's all that matters"}
{"text":"Friday night, DEAD as F*. But hey, fine by me, I'm here for the wings and not to be asked on the dance floor.  1. Sliders seemed like it was someone's left overs. Hard buns, stale, weird looking meat. Ew...I washed it down with the curly fries. Meh..   2. \"I would like my wings extra well done with extra sauce\". Pretty straight forward. I got a plate of KFC. A drip of sauce for 15 wings to bathe in that's barely cooked. I was given a hardened version of the sauce to remedy the problem. Was I supposed to spread it with a knife like jelly on toast?  Chicken was a never ending chew fest. A black vein hangs down as big as Schwarzenegger's biceps. To relieve my appetite loss I choked on their nasty water that tasted like rusty old pipes. Can you at least filter your f*ckin' water to wash down your nasty food?  There's nothing to Hoot and Holler about at this place. Give a HOOT, don't pollute!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience there, and decided to go back to give it another chance especially since it is the closest place of its type to my home, working 3 minutes driving distance. Had a great experience and can tell the business is maturing since its opening. We always sit at the bar, and did so this time as well. The ladies behind the bar (one was named Lindsey, I don't remember the other's name sorry) were very attentive and nice. We ordered the buffalo shrimp which I have ordered before and was unhappy with previously (I was craving shrimp). It was excellent this time as were my Daytona wings. Will definitely be coming back often, and I am definitely glad it has improved, with my crazy work hours and production schedule I don't get to get out for a beer too often, but I enjoy a comfortable place close to home. We told the Manager Ray about our experience and he was very accommodating and pleasant.   Info for those wishing to visit: Order the buffalo shrimp, it's very good.  They now have poker machines at the bar Very friendly staff While I was there the Blackhawks won game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals, so it's good luck."}
{"text":"My first visit to this establishment and it is my last!  The food and service was horrible and it was on a slow day.  The waitress brought our food and never came back.  Some ingredients were missing in my food order.  I could hear the waitresses visiting, talking and laughing instead of attending to their customers.  I don't see this place staying in business too long unless some big improvements are made.  Stay away, a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm a huge patriots fan from NE and have lived in Vegas for five years yrs now.  I finally found a patriots bar here in town HOOTERS! My bf and I along with friends we bring during all the games have a great time each time we come here.  Prices are great they had $4 beers which is awesome we drink a lot and eat a lot.  We went a few weeks ago and our server said \"oh management got rid of the drink specials but you can get a souvenir cup for $12!  But beers alone are now $8 or $9 that's rediculous the Patriots fans pack that place and give them tons of business.  Not impressed at all guess we won't be going there for superbowl!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience, we were actually headed to another restaurant and I saw the Hooters sign and got so excited! I read the Yelps on the way here and felt like I should've listened, but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to create my own experience. The wings were super dry and we had to get the re-tossed, they came back super greasy and the buffalo taste was non existent. Then we were charged an additional $1.09 for a each sauce. I was super sad with mu experience because I was delighted to go! I won't be returning. The manager was helpful and came to our table but this lunch experience was not worth $40."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience, awkward comment from bartender about a drink I requested, food over cooked and served cold and not prepared in the manner it was asked for and lastly asked for the check and it took 40 mins to get. The servers were not friendly when we asked for help and our server was hardly around! I have been coming here for a year once a month and today has ended that and not to mention I was charge extra for having a martini that was on the menu. I will not come back. You lost a regular!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  I'm so glad there's a location near me now.  As always, their chicken wings are to die for! Here's how to order them: 10-piece, all drums, breaded, hot (with ranch or blue cheese dressing - your choice). To top it off, you should add the grilled cheese sandwich with fries and your beer of choice. Oh man... don't forget some fried pickles! I have to go back now!"}
{"text":"We went here to watch the world series. Great service with a great happy hour! Wings were fabuloso! We will definately be going back."}
{"text":"I just go there to stare at Danny the manager. I could totally live without the food although I do like the buffalo shrimp."}
{"text":"I would have given only one star for this hooters but when you walked in, the aroma from the kitchen made me hungry. By far the worst service from the hostess/server or maybe she was both. We waited, the woman ahead of us was waiting, the two gentlemen ahead of her were waiting, the family before them were waiting. First of all,  the restaurant was pretty empty, which for the noon hour on a Thursday should have given us a clue. The server was at a table with a gentleman and even though we were vocal in line, she finally got up from her seat and went to the bar and delivered a drink to the gentleman. All of us left and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hooters but rarely come especially to this location because the service is always terribly slow. Tonight we were craving the usual wings and decided we should chance going to this location. There were only 3 other parties/tables in the restaurant besides us and the service was still painstakingly SLOW. We did not see our server for our entire meal and would not have had a drink refill if it hadn't been for the other server who walked by us. We waited so long to even get our check and that too was brought to us by the other server after she noticed we had been sitting there finished with our meals for quite some time. What should've been a quick meal turned into nearly 2 hours due to the lack of service!"}
{"text":"Here on a Friday night, seated quickly, ordered in a timely manner but it took forever to get our food. There are only 3 other tables in here.  Never asked for drink refills.  I had the sliders, don't recommend them. Dry burgers and weird chicken sliders.  Hubby had the chicken taco salad which he liked but the chicken was dry. The rest of our party had wings which they seemed they liked.  Maybe next time... no, I don't think there'll be a next time for us."}
{"text":"I must say when I have wow moments I must comment.  Stopped in hooters for a quick drink in between jobs. I was greeted by two lovely females, of course it's hooters!!! I got the name of one which is Nicole who was very friendly, & energetic. I must say my thirty minutes went very fast talking with Nicole. Great atmosphere football news were on which is always a plus. I must say I will return during a game, just to see if I'm treated the same. It's been a while but, I love this place."}
{"text":"Noticed the water cup we had had a build up on gunk on the inside of it. This grossed out my lunch guest and was absolute disgusting. Discovered this while paying the bill and told the Waitress who did absolutely nothing. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Sunday is cheat day!!  And I was seriously craving Hooter's Fried Pickles!  And those fried pickles were excellent!  However, the rest of our experience was lacking.  We ordered Chicken Nachos with only shredded cheese no nacho cheese, a cheeseburger, and mild wings.  Chicken Nachos- 1/5   It was literally just a towering plate of chips with sprinkled cheese on top they didn't even melt the cheese. We had it sent back and honestly it came back we ate the four chips that had actual substance to them then left the million other plain tortilla chips.  Mild Boneless Wings- 0/5   These were just terrible! They came out completely dry with no mild wing sauce on the entire plate. Plus the wings were chewy.  Cheeseburger- 3/5  Nothing spectacular but was edible so the winning meal of this day.  Fried Pickles- 5/5  Amazing like always.   If you come here only come for the Fried Pickles and maybe a beer."}
{"text":"One of the friendliest staff I have ever met.  everyone was really really nice. really happy good atmosphere. good food good happy hour prices. overall I was very impressed the first time ever to a Hooters I will return"}
{"text":"My 1st time at this location.   The place has so many TV'S.  what a great place. The girls were hot and the coronas were cold.   Thank you Donald the manager who stopped by to make sure we were doing well.  Loved the bacon wrapped wings"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Came in for simple drink and dinner. Ordered a blended margarita which was on the menu. 20 minutes later no drink. The server goes to check again. She comes back and tells me the bartender says he's too busy to make it. I look around the almost deserted restaurant, and after I pick my jaw back up off the floor, I suggest that she should tell her manager about that answer. Another 10 minutes. She comes back and says that the manager was going to deal with it. Another 10 minutes and the manager does come by and apologize, but not without making excuses for how busy is bartender is. I get my drink when I am three quarters done with my dinner. I guess the bartender gets the last laugh, since my \"blended margarita\" was 80% ice and I'm fairly certain there was no tequila in it at all!  And after all that, there was no comped dinner, dessert, drink... No nothing! Save your time and your money and go somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Every time i order they fail to read the tickets and mess my order up. Numerous times. From forgetting sauce ,to full ordered items, undercooked pink wings, soggy fries, cold food, a drink. They don't care. I've called in and asked who does to-go orders.  Angel the \"manager\" says he does, and i explain my difficulties and he says oh well that's the girls fault, Uber's fault , well u let it get to uber you should check it before u give the order away. after admitting he does to-go orders and hangs up on me numerous times. Don't get food from here unless you want food poisoning and rude, bad service. I've only complained once and after the service , i will also be complaining to corporate."}
{"text":"BEST wings out there. You can tell Hooters provides great quality when the feathers are still on some of the wings! Great sized and breaded wings with many different flavors. The wings are all I get here. Period.   Everything in this restaurant is kept CLEAN! From the tables to the floors and to the windows.   Great customer service by the Hooters girls. Not too attentive but also not too far away when you need to ask them for something.   I recommend coming to this Hooters. It's definitely a great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! We went here last night and the food and service was atrocious! First let me start by saying there were only 5 people in the establishment yet it took them 37 minutes to bring our food. Then when we did get our food mine was cold.. So I let the waitress know and she said oh and took my plate. She brought it back 5 minutes later and I could tell all they did was refry the same shrimp and give it back to me. Once we got drinks she never asked if we wanted more. And to top it off she brought the checks before we said we were done. We paid and still were sitting there to watch the rest of the game, but she kept pacing back and forth looking at us like we were supposed to leave. I will NEVER return to this establishment again! Worst customer service ever!! Please beware"}
{"text":"It's Hooters. You know what you're getting. Does this need a review? Hot wings that you can count on. Domestic brews and sports on the TV. America in a room!"}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times now, so I can finally say I'm just not fan. My BF loves his sports, so we always sit at the bar. Our bartenders have always been friendly and attentive, so the stars go off to them. But the chicken wings, which Hooters is famous for, are just not good. They aren't cooked enough because the meat near the bone is still pink. I shouldn't have to say well done on my wings for a place that specializes in wings. There are always little feathers that are still left on. Not appetizing at all. And the breading on them is just too thick. I will definitely not be back because I can make chicken wings in my own kitchen much better than this place."}
{"text":"Great wings and service. This is what you expect from Hooters and they delivered. Stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. A family having a birthday and another celebrating a reunion. great location off of Eastern. Cant wait for football season!"}
{"text":"I gave them two stars only because the food was good not sure what happened to them always got great service at Hooters this time though surface was not good the waitress tell me search me a refill and Diet Coke she never did talk to the manager he said he was going to bring me a Diet Coke took another 10 minutes then the waitress asked how I was doing I told her about the diet coke she did to me after about 20 minutes the manager also bought me a Diet Coke after 10 minutes so then I had to die quotes the service was not good at all not sure what happened"}
{"text":"I had never been to hooters before tonight and I definitely will not return. I don't know if all locations are like this one or not but it ruined it for the rest of them. My waitress told me they had no orange juice at the bar, there was no iced tea in the whole restaurant, we couldn't sit at a regular table, all of their martini glasses broke last night ( sounds pretty unbelievable). I went into the bar and there was iced tea, there was orange juice and it was just the waitress did not want to do their job. It's sad that people like that can keep a job. The food took forever and it wasn't even busy and honestly did not taste good. Worst cocktails ever made, I've had better in a dotty's. I just wouldn't recommend this place at all to anyone for any reason."}
{"text":"Constantly screw my order up. Servers even remember me by my order and kitchen still screws it up.  7 total people in the restaurant, 5 of them sitting at the bar, and it took 20 minutes to get the wrong food. Now we're  another 20 minutes and still nothing."}
{"text":"Just came in for lunch and to watch the playoff baseball game of the Chicago Cubs and we had great service and amazing food place was so clean Donald the manager was so nice he sat and talked with us for 15 minutes  Love the fried pickles I had to do a Hooters in probably five years but I'll definitely be there"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery thru Grub Hub and picked the fish and chips.  Since I got a side of tots, I paid extra to get onion rings instead of fries.  I still got fries.  And to make it worse, there was no ketchup for them."}
{"text":"There is are a few tricks to this place. 1: If you must order boneless wings (Let's be honest, that's like ordering non-alcholic beer) but if you must, get a dry rub, not t a sauce. 2: When ordering bone-in do not get them with the breading/batter, get them naked. Other than that, have fun and don't take yourself too seriously when at Hooters.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Hooters restaurants and this is the only location that has ever given me any problems. We came in with a group of six. Our waitress was Tabitha. We all ordered wings except for one person who ordered a PLAIN GRILLED fish sandwich. The first time the sandwich came out, it was fried with cheese on it. After the waitress was told again, the sandwich came out grilled but covered with cheese. The waitress was told once again.  She grabbed the plate and proceeded to get an attitude and kicked the kitchen door open. Less than a couple minutes the plain sandwich came out. It was about half the size of the other ones. The spicy garlic sauce was terrible. We had ordered that plenty of times and it has never tasted like this. The medium sauce was also disgusting. Only things good were the lemon pepper baked wings, the fried pickles, and the fries. Get this girl some customer service training, please...and some effective ways to sharpen her listening skills."}
{"text":"Our server was Cassie and we had a great experience. She was so nice and attentive and made suggestions. We got the fried pickles and wings which were great. They had a special on certain beers for 4 dollars which we took advantage of. After we closed out our check with Cassie we went to the bar to gamble. The bartender was really nice and even let us sample beer before we made our decision. We ordered dessert and the drinks while we gambled (and lost) 66 dollars between the two of us. When we got the check we were surprised not even one drink was comped off. Maybe this is hooters protocol but I have experience with gaming bars in Las Vegas and have always been comped based on money gambled. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Dead end! If you are coming from a long trip do not stop here! We waited for about 10 min to be seated, and no one ever shows up. There was only one person dining in."}
{"text":"Went to this location for a friend's 21st birthday. I give the waitress props, the birthday boy was quite rambunctious and brave with his words - but she was a dear and very sweet! Unfortunately, my husband and I came a little and everyone had already ordered. We assumed they would quickly take our order, but instead we sat for close to 10 mins and they brought out everyone else's food, THEN took our order. Everyone was done by the time we got our food. Also the price - what the heck?! I got 10 boneless wings, assuming (my fault) that they would be decent size, and maybe even come with a side of fries or something for $14. Nope. Tiny little popcorn chicken and that's it. I was still hungry after finishing them! Pretty sad for spending $20 myself on dinner. I was only there for a party so I highly, highly doubt I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Came in around lunch time and the place was absolutely empty. I thought they were closed.  I have to say each Hooters does not keep their consistency. We usually visit the Hooters on Rainbow and 215. Place is busy, staff is friendly, food is good. This Hooters was completely different.  Service staff was all sitting in the front having a discussion. Could care less that customers were actually in their facility.  Food was not that great. I don't know what kind of chicken this location uses but it didn't taste like chicken at all.  There are 2 other similar places to Hooters in this area and we'll be visiting those places next time."}
{"text":"Always a fun chain restaurant to go to, but this location has some really friendly waitresses.  Even the manager came by to make sure everything went well.  The two we had really made the experience that much more enjoyable.  Ask for Kaylee or Janice!  Both are awesome :)  The food is what you expect at a Hooters, decent bar food.  We had the Lots of Tots, Fried Pickles, Daytona Wings, and Texas Melt.  The tater tots are great with the melted cheese and bacon bits, fried pickles are alright, the Daytona wings bring a nice spicy bbq taste, and the Texas Melt is a great burger sandwich.  But the difference maker for any Hooters is the service in my opinion.  This one just opened, but the staff is on the right track with their service!  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered through Yelp where Grub Hub fulfilled the order. The orders have been on time and accurate. For some reason, this location is not very busy which can be great if you're trying to catch a ball game and not fight for a seat. I am guessing it's not too busy because it has a weird parking lot layout.  You can see the restaurant from the side on the busy street, but where you think you should turn into leads to a what looks like the back of the restaurant and in front of an auto shop. Then you have to walk around to the actual front of the store. Just a funky layout to get to the restaurant, but at least the food has been consistently good. The smoked wings are now my favorite. It's moist and has a good smoky flavor. You can get it in mild or hot. I prefer the mild, but that's cause I can't handle the hot sauce. The restaurant is clean and there are plenty of T.V.s to watch sports. Service is generally average. Sometimes one of the hostess is more enthusiastic than another, but none have been rude or unpleasant. I would come back to dine in, but ordering through Yelp is easy enough."}
{"text":"Not great customer service. Plus my server thought it would be great idea to erase my tip. And added her own unauthorized tip. Spoke with the managers. It's been several days still no response back. Reached out to my bank to cance the charge. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place! Friendly staff, great bar and good food!!! They usually have a lot of specials just have to ask!"}
{"text":"Brutal. It's my own fault, I kept giving them another chance. I don't know exactly how hard it is to take and pack a to-go order but it must be the equivalent of space travel because these people just can't get it right. I give up, they win, no more food orders from me. I would simply suggest checking the bag before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service ever.....I travel for work on a weekly basis and I am realistic with my expectations regarding these type of chain restaurants. I was with two others and we walked in to catch the end of the NBA Playoff game, probably 10 people in the entire place. We were greeted soon enough and ordered drinks, everything seemed on par from my past experiences in other states in Hooters restaurants   After ordering a total of 3 different types of wings (should be the basic of orders) we waited 35 min before we saw the waitress that came and informed us she forgot to submit the flavor of the wings..... It was tough 10 hot breaded and 10 medium breaded....   We then did see her reappear to talk to the other waitress and send text messages on her phone. After almost an hour and asking what looked to be the manager on duty we received our food.  The waitress then informed us that she was turning the table over to someone else and that was the extent of our service before paying the bill.... I had to even go to the bar to get a refill of water..... I will give credit to the gentleman behind the bar as he just charged us for the drinks and comped the food. I should have read prior reviews as it is spot on regarding the service.  I would recommend to save your money and stay away from this location"}
{"text":"Nothing special here folks. Service was nice and food was average. A bit dark and dingy for a lunch place but I was here for the wings. And they did not disappoint. Thank you"}
{"text":"I have to say that I haven't been to hooters for years and l wasn't expecting much and really nothing at all. I have to say that they have stepped up their game food was good but the service was even better, our server was Nicole and she was amazing and so personable. She made our overall experience a great one! Then we went to the upper bar and Amber was so friendly and welcoming which took my rating to a 10 to an 11!"}
{"text":"Second time here, still not that great! Handprints all over the glass that separates the bar from the restaurant. Dirty bathroom!! Empty panty hose box left in the bathroom... hmmm I wonder who those belong to???? Tissue on the floor... dirty toilets....Food was mediocre, wings did not have enough sauce!!! For a place that is known for wings they need to step it up!!! Does not live up to all they hype about the wings!!! Go across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings!!!My chicken sandwich was Ok... Hostess and server were not friendly!!! I guess you have to be at the bar!!!! Boo"}
{"text":"The only thing I buy from Hooter's are their buffalo shrimp. The chicken is often too big, still has feathers on it, under cooked and simply...not as good as they use to be. Every once in a while, we will go just because we hate Buffalo Wild Wings. I'm hoping that Hooter's can get it together because I've always enjoyed their food. I'm sure they can turn it around soon!"}
{"text":"Its a hooters, but this one is new, has a nice patio, and they really love my dog here.   The staff are really nice, bathrooms are clean,  TV's everywhere.   Food takes a little long,  but we do mostly come here on Sunday."}
{"text":"This Hooters is the Best in Las Vegas!!! Excellent wings, sliders and Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  Our waitress, Shannon, was very attentive, cheerful and really knows her job! We will be asking for her section on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit for good food and great service.  Courtney, the bartender, is very courteous, friendly and makes great drinks! I love coming here when she's working, she's very attentive to me and my friends.  Make sure you ask for her when you get there."}
{"text":"My waitress Marybelle was a champ! It was very busy World Series and she was running all over the place. Attention owners get more hooter waiters. Especially when it gets busy! It was only her and a new girl, who still needed training. Overall I was satisfied with my cold beers and wings. Hooters has the best garden salads!!! So many tvs to watch from I love it!! They had some alcohol specials that were awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try it out for lunch on a weekday. Place was empty so service was a non issue. Menu choices are good with wings and other things. My server was right on top of things and my wing order was very good. All in all a good experience and by the time I left they had a good crowd going. Watch for my dinner review from the same night."}
{"text":"Was surprised and Happy when this location opened recently.  In the past few mo this I have been there a handful of times and always sit at the bar.  This is a great place to watch a game, as we were there for MNF.  Our drinks were never empty, and the bartenders and servers were all fun and happy.  He gaming is also very good here.  I've never walked out with less money than when I walked in!  Ownership is very friendly and definitely takes care of their regulars.  Nicole, Sumi, Taylor,  are all awesome!  Whenever I am back in town, I will always stop in a few times to eat and have a few cocktails.  Perfect neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Ordered on post mates and Hooters sent the wrong order. The half that was correct were the wings I ordered. They were drenched in oil and were not even close to bring appetizing. Spent $50 and had to dispute it with post mates. This was my first time ever having Hooters and I probably will just go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead. Kind of disappointing because everyone has recommended Hooters wings."}
{"text":"The best patio in town! You can see the strip, amazing views. Service, food and cold beverages are always the best!"}
{"text":"What a joke this place is.....Bartender came in acknowledged everybody at the bar but us and we were the only ones  gambling . we are huge fans of Hooters and only wanted to place an order for food.  Having worked for Hooters for many years as a general manager I would've never allowed our employees to portray the Hooters brand this way. We should've known walking in here hearing the first bartender complain to her customers that the management in this place sucks, and apologize for their bad experience. You have lost your Orange pride!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party (7 people) and the waitress we had gave terrible service. Half of the party arrived early and put in our orders for appetizers and entrée and we asked for the entrées to be brought out later, after the rest of the party had arrived and had a chance to order.   After being there for 45 minutes we got our appetizers and then another 45 minutes later everyone gets their entrees, EXCEPT myself and my sister. After notifying the waitress, she LIES and tells us that ours (we were sharing) are still being cooked.   10 minutes later she comes back and says \"you said you ordered wings? Well they never got put in... I can put them in for you now if you want?\"   I refused. She lied to our faces and then had the audacity not to really even apologize or offer to comp us anything.   To top all this off, she never asked us how we were doing and hardly made her way over to our table in the 2 hours our party was there.   I unfortunately don't have the receipt to name the waitress but I'd just stay clear of this establishment. There's plenty of places in Vegas with far better service and attractive waitresses."}
{"text":"Such an incredible location. Staff is so accommodating! I had a complicated \"Build Your Own Burger\" order and my waitress (a cute bubbly blonde girl named Hannah) knocked it out of the park! My husband and I had so much fun, and even took our drinks up to the patio after dinner to play Jenga and admire the strip. It was a surprisingly romantic evening! We'll definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I'm in most Monday nights for football, food is good, ambiance is great, and most of the servers have it together, (as in actually serving food and not just getting by on their looks). And it's close which is great!!!"}
{"text":"Got there at 12:00 noon on a Friday. Service started out okay and then went downhill, ordered two beers, one for me one for my dad, our server left them on the bar counter for 5 minutes.. we ended up having to go and grab them.. got asked how we were doing maybe 3 times the total 2 hours we were there.. 3 girls were \"working\" really only 1 girl working and the other two were on their phones sitting in a booth.  I'm a server myself, lemme tell ya, it's not that hard of a job lol but somehow these hooters girls managed to give us well below average service. My dad and i just said to each other \"we need to find a new place for lunch.\" Food took a little longer than normal but was amazing as always, but if you can't provide at least somewhat decent service, I'll take my business somewhere that can.  Asked for a manager and was told there wasn't one working at the moment.."}
{"text":"I went to this Hooters on 9/12/17 around 12:00 PM.  The place was dead and should have been in tip top shape.  Not the case.  Under my table, I looked because my child had dropped a crayon, it looked like days worth of old food, crumbs and other debris.  The reason I say this is their were a few Hooters girls on \"break\" taking care of one of their kids while supposedly working while their significant other was there sitting in front of us, for over an hour while other girls continued to sit with them, one of whom was our waitress.  (mind you only one other table had anyone at it.) The manager on duty also took part in this.  The real issue here is I ordered wings with no side dressing, my wife then ordered an extra side, which should have been mine given to her, nope they charged $1 and some change for it.  I had 2 chicken wings out of six in which I found hairs coming in and out of the breading,  (I shave my head so 100% not mine.) I informed this waitress with the response of \" It's prolly just the feathers.\" \"would you like to make more.\"  No I don't want more the hairs are in the batter.  I'm sorry but I work in customer service, and she should have informed the manager, who vanished after my complaint, to take care of my issue.  Needless to say I paid for six wings, when only four were edible, paid for extra dressing when it was mine just given to my wife.  Place is disgusting and would highly recomend the health department check this place out.  If it was this bad in the front of house and in the food, I can only wonder how horrific it must be in the back of house.  I WOULD LOVE A RESPONSE FROM THE MANAGEMENT OR OWNER TO THIS."}
{"text":"I have been here too many times to count but it just keeps getting worse and worse. I love the Daytona wings but even they can't change the awful service. This will be the last time I visit this location. Waited 10 minutes to be greeted by our waitress (watch out for Alexa: she has ZERO ppl skills) another 10 to order our drinks, another 10 to receive the drinks, 20 to receive our appetizer, another 30 to receive our food which was not the correct order. Told her we didn't want the food anymore, just our check. Oh and then she brought us someone else's check... then waited another 15 mins to receive OUR check. Then another 15 mins for the corrected check. Fml. Did I mention it wasn't even busy? Doesn't hooters train their waitresses?? Is this real life???"}
{"text":"On may 18th we came here with our friends and their kids for his birthday. It was the Stanley cup playoffs and they were slammed. One complaint after the other but every single girl worked their ass off and kept a smile on their face. They were not responsible for the chaos. I appreciate how hard they worked in a tough situation. Shaniece was our server and for her first day she did great smiling through the chaos. Ciara was the host and she had to deal with a lot. Jasmine Ashley and Yuri all helped out amazingly and ALWAYS do. I hope they all can get recognition for all they did and do!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different Hooters in several different states.. From Florida up the coast to Rhode Island... Even Canada. I love Hooters!! Out of all my Hooters experience, this particular location stands out the most. But not for any good reason...   Walked in, I actually thought perhaps they didn't lock the doors and they were closed. It was mid week, around 830. Ok.. not a big deal. We could hear someone in the back yelling about the front door. Here come's a friendly hooters waitress. No smile, no apology she just asked if we wanted bar or restaurant and pointed in a direction for us to select from (basically any table because we were the only ones there) She went back to argue with the girl who was yelling about not being a hostess, etc. Almost felt like we were interrupting... Table was sticky, floor was sticky.. just yuck. The food was cooked fresh and the rest of the visit was fine, no issues with the mediocre service. It just seemed like they would rather do anything else but be bothered by guests. Very anti-hooters like... Meaning any other location the girls are happy and say hi to everyone not just their own tables. It was very twilight-zone like lol... After we ate, we reached for the traditional roll of paper towels when we noticed none of the tables have them. They had utensils (who uses utensils at hooters) wrapped up in one skimpy napkin... definitely not a well thought out plan to save on those paper towel expenses.  I still love Hooters... This is my last visit to this location and it's a shame because it's relatively close to home."}
{"text":"Friday Night Wings & Beer Were Bomb! Great customer service, thanks Alexa you made our night. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the roof top bar which is cool  Service was ok dale as food just ok Nothing special needs"}
{"text":"So I see that Hooters has went up on the pricing on their wings. what I find interesting is that how can they go up on the price of their chicken wings but the quality of their service has drastically drop down.  Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop any day before I go to a Hooters and pay $15 for 10 wings  3.50 for fries lol that's a rip. And 7.99 boneless Wednesday is now 10.99 boneless Wednesday.  I'm done.  Buffalo Wild Wings and Wing Stop here I come"}
{"text":"My girlfriend bought me a $25 gift card just for kicks and so after months of having it we decided to use it for to go.  The parking lot sucks as its shared with an auto shop place so they have a bunch of cars there. We enter in and it's quiet, but then again idk how busy it does get on a Thursday afternoon. We waited about 5 mins before a server acknowledged us. But she said she was the only working right now, so I bypassed it.  We ordered our food and it took 20 mins for it to come out.   We leave and get home to enjoy our meal and to my dismay I took a bite into my buffalo chicken sandwich and was consumed by this weird taste. Idk if you've ever smelled bad raw chicken, but it tasted like it. I had to stop eating it cause I wasn't going to take my chances. The only good things they offered was their curly fries, cheese sticks and fried pickles. Pretty disappointed.  2 stars went to the nice waitress and decent appetizers."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place is empty !!!! you all sucks!!!!! One or two tables with costumers!!! From water down ranch & blue cheese  Creamy blue cheese dressing...Not in here Attentive and friendly service NOP... a clean table NOP $10 for a beer I will rather be at strip bar...lol well what else do you have to do went you do t have any other duties!!! Work related..lol Not been in your mobile phone or chilling ar rhe bar have to wait for a proper service went you rather been hanging at the bar doing nada... Now do you thing you deserve a tip???? And the worst part is managment don't give a fuck  Just wondering how employees managment relationships are because after a lot of negative reviews nothing's has changed."}
{"text":"Gross. Dried grease. Looks like these were leftover and reheated.   Called in to see why these looked dusty, manager just stated that's the way medium wings look.   Probably not gonna order from here again."}
