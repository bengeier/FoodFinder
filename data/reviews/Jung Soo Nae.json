{"text":"I took my family of six out for dinner based off of the reviews here. Overall the food was delicious. I fell in love with the stone bibimbap and can't wait to go back for more! The gamjatang was a bit lacking in spice but it was okay. 

The prices were reasonable and the service wasn't bad. The restaurant was much bigger than I expected and the decor was quaint. 

The location and food makes it an attractive option for me to go again."}
{"text":"The other day, I was lamenting the fact that the pork bone soup nowadays are worse than it was about 10 years ago. It has become so toned down (not spicy anymore!) that it doesn't taste like a Korean dish at all. Not to mention the pork bones getting cheaper and cheaper and the stuffer potatoes that are completely tasteless.

Not for this restaurant, though. The pork bone soup here is easily the best I have had in the last 10 years. The pork bones are high quality bones cooked to perfection. Instead of the tasteless potatoes, we got cabbage. The difference is huge. Cabbages absorbs the soup and becomes very tender and juicy (very much like hot kimchi). The soup has about 5-7 pieces of pork bones and it's about $7. It's well worth the money.

I have also tried Tonkatsu (pork). Unlike the previous reviewer, I am actually not too impressed. It's a bit tough for my liking. I do see a lot of Koreans ordering different kinds of dishes. I will definitely come again to try some of them.

The restaurant is located in a rather shabby area. I am happy I didn't drive away immediately because the inside of the restaurant is a different story. It's spacious and clean. I am especially impressed by their \"huge\" tables. Kids will have a lot of area to do their drawing and sketching and what not.

I do feel that they are more used to serving Koreans but the servers are nice nonetheless."}
{"text":"first time ever eating raw crab, really interesting."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant yesterday (my second time of the month and the forth time for my friend). I really like the soondooboo (seafood tofu soup).  The kamjatang was average, I wish it came with potato in the broth.  But overall quality of food was great!"}
{"text":"The original owner of Jung Soo Nae Korean restaurant sold her Yonge and Finch (North York) location and moved all the way up to Major Mack and Yonge.  

When this family business worked out of its shady North York location, I was a regular.  It, in my opinion, was as closest as you can get to homemade Korean food at a Korean person's house.  The ban-chan was fantastic and the food was even better.  The place itself was kinda run down and deterred many customers from venturing in.  

However, now that the owner has sold it and relocated her restaurant to a nicer, cleaner Richmond Hill location, all is good.

People - especially Chinese-Canadians - always ask me:  \"Where is a good Korean restaurant?\"  After the popularity of the Kdrama, \"Dae Jang Geum\", all Chinese-Canadians now seem to want the real-deal Korean food.  No wonder Yonge and Finch restaurants all have a special Chinese menu (in most cases).

Well, this is one restaurant I can say is truly exceptional.  It's authentic.  It's clean - now that they are at the new place.  And the people are nice.  

This place is about $1-$3 more expensive than other restaurants.  That can be considered the only down fall, but in my personal opinion, it's well worth it.

Highly recommend:
1)  Tonkatsu (breaded deep friend pork or chicken cutlet) 
- I don't know one person who walks away from this meal unsatisfied.  The portion is huge.  I am a big eater and this fills me.  You'll only enjoy this if you like Japanese style Korean food.  

2)  Pork bone soup 

3) Beef bone soup

Stay away from:
1) Kimchi chigae - it's strange that a restaurant that cooks some dishes so well sucks bollocks cooking this classic Korean dish.  The Kimichi chigae was sub-par.  I thought I was back in Japan eating the Japanese version of this Korean classic.  Don't order this."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Being ignored for 30 minutes. Had to ask twice just to get tea. No napkins  were given. Food is ok. Generous side dish. The fried dumpling tasted good, but pork bone soup is under cooked. Very hard and difficult to separate meat from the bones. Won't come back"}
{"text":"I LOVE going to this Korean restaurant. Their side dishes are so yummy and  bowl soups(Soft Tofu, Fermented Soybeans, Pork Bones... ) are so authentic. BBQ ribs are must to try.  My whole family go there at least once a week. Whenever I think of their marinated crabs, I get a huge craving for them. Hmm their Kimchi is remarkable. I wish I know how to make them that delicious.  For kids I recommend pork cutlet, Bulgoggi (Korean style teriyaki beef dish) or Bibimbob (assorted vegetable and some beef and sweet and hot pepper sauce). 

The parking lot is huge.

I cannot wait until I go next time. 
: )"}
{"text":"A good authentic Korean restaurant. Waitress didn't speak much English but good thing I was there with a Korean friend. The food was comparable to all the other Korean restaurants in the area but I just wish they had the side dishes I wanted. I like the sweet/sour radish, fish cakes, kimchii and the soy beans. But this place didn't have many of my favorites. Really cozy on the inside and good amount of parking spaces on the outside. Prices are fair and portions are filling even for me but it was probably filling enough for me since I was dining with an Asian female and you know how they don't eat much...lol"}
{"text":"Went here with 1 other person for lunch
We ordered the kalbi bento box ($9.99) which was VERY tasty; 3 long ribs (or 9 when cut) served with purple rice and 5 side dishes
Also the lunch bibimbap (first time having this... it was good but the lettuce was weird in it... i took it out) the waitress brought a sweet, spicy sauce for it, which was tasty ($7.99 i think)
Also had the tofu soup with seafood; this was good and spicy but had A LOT of onions in it, which i fished out ($8.99)
We also ordered this pan fried fish, which is a dinner item ($15.99)
everything was very tasty
there was a nice selection of the \"side dishes\"
but it is a bit pricier than other Korean restaurants
all in all, quite enjoyable"}
{"text":"Jung Soo Nae is without a doubt, one of my favourite Korean restaurants in the world.  We do not get there often enough as its far from where we live, but for special occasions, this is thE place to go.  It is like I am back in Korea, enjoying quality panchan (amazing baechu kimchi) and san manul (mountain garlic) which is my favourite panchan ever.  The san manul is prepared with a light soya sauce, mirin and vinegar dressing and it is indescribably delicious.  My fermented soy bean stew (chonggukchang chigae) was divine (as always).  It is a pleasant dining experience and the focus is on quality, traditional Korean food.  I have known this couple who own this restaurant for almost 20 years and we always receive a warm welcome when we go there.  I wish I lived closer - I'd be there every weekend!"}
{"text":"Cozy little Korean place. Seems pretty authentic. I like that Korean rice tea they give and the appetizers. 

The pork cutlet which isn't really a Korean dish was surprisingly good. Huge dish. Thin but packed with flavour and texture for the cutlet. Comes with purple rice and a salad. The taste of everything seemed to come together for me.

The soup was apparently quite tasty too. I would have gotten it if it wasn't so nice and warm outside :)

Seems like a hidden gem for korean food if you don't want to travel all the way to yonge and finch. The menu is limited but still sufficient choices."}
{"text":"Don't be taken back by the location in the corner for an boring strip mall. The inside is spacious and very clean. The selection of authentic korean fare is amazing with all the classics.

The pork bone soup here is super tasty. No wimpy use of spice here, the broth is not only red and firey but very flavorful. The bones or not some soup stock castaways, but good quality bones with meat and texture. 

The soon tofu with seafood is the best I have had, way better than the koreatown shops. Tofu is smooth and silky and there is an abundance of seafood. 

Will be back to try all the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Jung Soo Ne is hidden in one of the strip plaza in Richmond Hill, not easy to see if you just drive by. The menu here is extensive with pages and pages of all the Korean cuisine you can think of!

Lunch Specials from $6.99 is quite a good deal! Since it is a Korean BBQ restaurant, I decide to try their Kalbi Bento Box for $9.99. I am surprise when it arrived there are 9 pieces of short ribs grilled to perfection and served with my favourite purple rice! The benchan are served in the Bento bos and they are all fresh and tasty. 

I definitely recommend going to Jung Soo Ne if you are in the Richmond Hill area.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"A huge craving for Gamjatang - pork backbone ribs soup with veggies - and I'm very delighted with this place.  They just got everything right with the rich and sumptuous flavour I was hoping to find!  Not many Korean places can really hit the spot.

Another good dish is the Soondooboo jjigae - soft tofu with seafood and veggies.  Its all so good as it goes down nice & hot.  

I forgot the name, but its chicken balls with vegie and rich red sauce.  OMG, that's hot! Its so hard to get to the chicken with that layer of hot stuff but once you do, you'll sing num-num-num...!  Its kinda masochist, finding pleasure in that suffering, but to each his own. LOL  Food trip!

I like being served that purple rice you don't usually find in other Korean places. For me its quite a treat.

I feel at home here with my family perhaps because the food is right down homestyle like it was carefully and patiently made.  The simplicity and abundance of flavour and meat are very satisfying.  Got a good kick for authentic Korean food, and Korean shows on tv, too!  ;D  

The food experience was awesome.  The service totally cool.  Check this out in Richmond Hill.  The food is amazing!"}
