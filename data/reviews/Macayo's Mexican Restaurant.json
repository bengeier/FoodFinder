{"text":"Bland, Plan, Boring lack of taste... If you want cheap horrible mexican food This is it. I was so bummed out my party of 5 all left there plates almost full Great tap water horrible food     \"MY ADVICE STAY AWAY BLAND TASTELESS FOOD YUCK  SUPER SAD\""}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The food is awful. I ordered the steak fajitas and it was not good. Service was bad, my sister who is vegan ordered the veggie fajitas, they gave her steak.  I ordered pico de gayo to go with the chips and salsa and it never came.  My husband got some steak thing and it was smothered with nacho cheese (I'm pretty sure from the can).  One thing positive was the place was packed with rowdy kids and families so it was kid friendly."}
{"text":"My roommate LOVES the shredded beef baja enchilada with extra baja sauce. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't exactly wow me either.  What did stand out was that the waiter refilled our waters regularly (which Ryan really appreciates). He also refilled our chips right before we even finished! Granted, it was slow in the restaurant, but I heard that the service was rather poor... so it was nice to see that today was an exception for us.  20% Rebel Discount!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I'm in Las Vegas! I live in Logandale but come to Vegas occasionally and always stop by Macayo's to eat before I head back. They have the best chips and salsa and I always get the chili relleno. I like the Mexican-American menu because there's always something for my picky wife and kids.and the atmosphere is really laid-back. I recommend trying this Las Vegas staple!"}
{"text":"When we're in Vegas, we like to eat off of the strip some. My grandparents are very fond of this place so we come at least once a summer. This is your typical mediocre chain. The portions are large and it looks like a basic Mexican restaurant. It's not the best I've had but not the worst either. I think every region has one of these \"family\" chains that the older crowd love. I probably wouldn't come back unless I had to."}
{"text":"Macayos is a family owned establishment, not a chain as mentioned.  I have known the family since the early 70's when it was horseshow tradition to go eat there at their location on paradise road after a long day of showing.  I still go there 45 years later and get my favorite TCT and smooth sauce, love the chips and sauce, could be a meal on their own.  The beans and rice are great, even as leftovers.  I continue to take my horse show friends there, so, they too can experience in the tradition..  I miss Eddie Sr. He was the nicest man, but looks that his son, Eddie Jr, has things well in hand. Great place, great food, great memories!!!! And to the jack ass with the salsa is Pace out of a jar, this is the same family salsa they have used for 45 year, so.... Get a flipping clue"}
{"text":"Just went to dinner with my family for new years. Very few customers, yet, there were at least 15 servers that passed us. We were sat relatively fast, yet we were practically ignored for most of our meal. The waitress took our drink order, then came back 10 minutes later with them. By then, we were out of chips on both sides of the table, and of course, they were never refilled regardless of us asking, twice. She took our food order, and when it came, she was mixing up the orders, which is mostly understandable since they looked pretty much the same. Then after our drinks were emptied, we requested those be refilled, and they were not. Then, after biting into my food (grilled chicken tacos) I realized my chicken was dry as hell. I poured the chicken out of my tacos and just ate the lettuce, rice, and beans. Not exactly what I was paying $12 for. After complaining, I got a $2 military discount off of my bill. Yet, when requesting to speak with the manager, and requesting boxes, and refills YET again, I was ignored. So here I am, after filling out my comment card, letting you know not to go to this place when you want quality service and food. I have much more I could tell you (the skimpy-ness of my fiancé's shrimp tacos, the watery-ness of the salsa, etc.), but I'm just going to leave it as this. And the waitress's name was Wendy. While she wasn't rude or anything, she was very unattentive, and I don't appreciate it."}
{"text":"This review goes for all the Macayos in Vegas. Been eating there since the 70's and it's my favorite Mexican restaurant because of the TCT and I love the beef ecnchiladas and the fajitas. Hundreds of other Mexican restaurants have opened and most are very good, but I still like Macayo best."}
{"text":"I dined here with my parents, because they had frequented Macayo's when they were in high school. Unfortunately, this time, they were disappointed and felt that it had gone downhill. I on the other hand had nothing to compare it to. I thought the salmon tacos were so-so; adequate after a lot of margarita, but not great. They did have corn tortillas (thank goodness) but there was no interesting sauce. I don't know if they forgot it, or...? They did make a substitution for me (grilled vegetables for the rice and beans), which was cool. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive. The house margarita was really, really weak but tasted pretty good, so I ordered another margarita, but one of the fancier ones (the \"cowboy\" or the \"Texan\" or some kind of western name) on the rocks. On the rocks turned out to be a giant tub of booze with a few melted ice cubes swimming in it. It was also much, much stronger than the house margarita; like too strong."}
{"text":"First off, I work sort of late so at 7:45pm I called this location to get closing time & was told 10pm.  We arrived at Macayos at 8:55 pm and was promptly sat.  We were approached few min later by a heavy set Hispanic man (apparently our server) keep in mind not with a welcome but telling us they close in 2 min.  I informed him I did call before arriving & was told they close at 10.  Apparently, I frustrated him so he went and got Sammy to get our order.  Although Sammy was very nice he took our order in some blue gloves & served our food in same gloves (serving our food at same time as our desserts) Now I know for a fact Sammy was a busser & this is definitely NOT his job.  Handling food & disposing of dirty plates is a health code violation & his gloves illustrated Sammy probably didn't wash his hands. And I do commend Sammy for taking us when our server didn't care to serve us, if it wasn't for Sammy had we even got any service???  No one checked on us we were just given the cold shoulder.  Just shameful service.  I work as a server in one of the 5 star casinos on Las Vegas strip, had I provided service in which I received here I would have been in the managers office after shift.  SMH sad service Macayo."}
{"text":"Good eats here. The staff is quick to service and friendly. I had the Baja Enchiladas. They come with a Baja Sauce. Think of it as a Mexican Alfredo sauce."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The Baja enchilada was great with the cream cheese sauce. The service was excellent. Jay was our server. Our glasses were always full and everything came out on time and hot. Best Mexican food I have had in a long time. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"The look and atmosphere of this place is starting to show its age. We just ate there for dinner, and the food was mediocre at best, stale tasting chips.   After we finished with our so so meal, our waitress was no where to be found. We learned she was attending a large group and she just abandoned us. It felt satisfying leaving no tip.  Adios Macayo, we'll NEVER return."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 12 for a birthday. The server messed up our meal which was supposed to be a shrimp dish with white cream sauce. The sauce tasted like it came straight from a can and we had to eat it after everybody else in our party was already finished with their meal.  Very disappointed!  We won't come back anytime soon. This restaurant was great for years, but not anymore."}
{"text":"Macayo's has been a stand-by favorite of mine since the wee age of 14. I still order the same thing (either a TCT - toasted cheese tortilla or a Quesadilla). The cheese they use, and I know cheese, is SUPERB.  The chips and salsa are crazy delicious. In fact, this is the first place I ever tried salsa (I told you I was picky!) and have been hooked ever since. They serve both smooth and chunky so you can make the decision for yourself.  Margaritas = :)   I could see how people would say it's not very authentic. Fortunately for Macayo's, I am no expert on authenticity. But I hardly have to twist the arms of my friends who are experts in that field to dine at Macayo's with me.  But that could be because I only insist on getting the Fried Ice Cream after our meal. One of my favorite deserts in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been coming here all my life, never been disappointed. Combination chicken taco, and enchiladas are great and surprisingly the honey BBQ wings are to die for!"}
{"text":"Flat soda, stale chips, rude servers, small portions, old beans, crappy fast food Mexican. This place has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Wife wanted to go to Macayo for their baja burrito, so we went.     I had the poblano chile stuffed with chicken , cheese and covered in baja sauce.  It is deep fried in a crispy breading and it was very good. Almost like a chile relleno , but crispier and IMO better       . My wife's favorite is chile relleno and by the way she was eying my food , I know she was kicking herself for not taking my suggestion again and ordering this dish, but I gave her a taste anyway , just to tease her. Lol       We also had the green tamale bites as an appetizer ,  it came with Baja sauce.           The tamale bites are sweet masa balls that are deep fried and are addicting.. Service was fine.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food ,We will be back"}
{"text":"Ok. So .... not a huge fan of macayos. It's very basic mexican food. I've had some bad ass mexican food in San diego!!!! I went to macayos today and I had to share my favorite thing is 5.95 for a huge bag of yummy hot chips and a 24 ounce (or less) full of salsa chunky or smooth. I'm having friends over tonight so I added an extra salsa (extra charge) I have a large amount of chips and salsa and that's my favorite thing about macayos. If ur craving chips and salsa this is the spot for chips to go. Bang for your buck"}
{"text":"Parking needs to improved  The building is old but in good condition.   Cleanliness is not bad, but could be better. (Vents were dirty)  The food is outstanding,  which is driving the 5 star review.  Love the food here."}
{"text":"I was part of a party of 20 that met for lunch here. We made reservations 1 week in advance yet the manager only assigned one waiter for our group. The service was very slow. We were there for an hour before the waiter took our order. A friend of mine jumped up and started refilling our drinks because we could never find our waiter when we needed him. It took another half hour before the food was served. The food was ok but not worth the wait, I have gone to this restaurant before with smaller groups and had similar experiences.  The waiter was nice and patient but he should've had help."}
{"text":"I am thankful to know that there are still two Macayo's left in Las Vegas. What a disppointment that the East Tropicana locale has  closed with very little info. The TCT's are amazing and a tradition for those growing up in Las Vegas. I hope folks will patronize the remaining restaurants so all can continue to enjoy this wonderful and familiar favorite."}
{"text":"Great food ! My husband and I enjoy coming here on our date nights. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The chips make you really full so you won't finish your food, unless your like gorilla hungry.  I went with my bosses because they LOVE it here. I got a combination plate with a chicken taco and a baja enchillada and it was soooo freakin good. I was muchin! From what I heard how good the food taste depends on what resturant you go to and they say this is the best and I can't argue!"}
{"text":"Good food for the price, good service.  I had the chicken poblano, a special that night, and it was great. This is an Americanized Mexican food place, with a fun interior, a great place for a lunch or dinner away from the strip.  I give it four stars for the value."}
{"text":"The is my local Mexican restaurant. The margaritas are great. And the service has always been spot on. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went with a group of about 10 people for dinner on a Friday night. They had a table saved for us in the bar area which was perfect. It takes groups awhile to get there so the server was checking on us from time to time and getting drinks as people wandered in. They also brought lots of chips and salsa for us which were very tasty.  My dish was wonderful, (I ordered the baja enchiladas) and there was lots of rice and beans that came with it. i also ordered the side salad for $1.99 extra and it was really good. The rest of the table seemed to like everything they ordered.  I will stop there again if i am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great brunch!!  Food was delicious as usual. Will be back again...   the best is the chips and salsa. Don't forget to grab a bag and some salsa to take home."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, for the bar service and the price for the delicious generous plates. I love the drink prices as well. I would say the Salsa for the chips does need more of a flavor, but other than that, I'm quite content with Macayo. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have to say the last few times we have been here the service has been awful.  Our last visit was so bad we had to leave.  We walked into the restaurant with manager leaning over the counter clearly looking like she hated her life and did not want to be there...really inviting right???  Then our waitress looked like she had a rough night.  TOOK FOREVER TO GET REFILLS.  Finally asked for the manager and not sure what was wrong with her.  Asked for the GM's card and she told me I could write a note and she would give it to him.  LOL YUP IM SURE THATS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO.  Will never come here again!!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!! Don't come here! My boyfriend and I went last night for happy hour and had margaritas. We ate chips and salsa and both ordered enchiladas.  I got chicken and beef Baja. He got all shredded beef Baja. We shared each others food so it's hard to say what it's from, I'm way sicker than him though. I would just avoid this place all together!!!"}
{"text":"I HEART MARGARITAS BABYYY  I think I found my drink now that this place introduced itself to me during HAPPY HOUR:  All week long! 3:30 pm - 6:30 pm (Available in Bar & Patio Only)  Happy Hour Specials: $4.75 16oz. Margarita de Macayo, $2.50 Domestic Bottle Beer, $3 Import Bottle Beer, &  1/2 price appetizers  Also, spreading the word here: $5.99 Lunch Specials 11am-3pm Mon-Fri  Monday_ Chimichanga de Macayo  Tuesday_ Beef taco & cheese enchilada with rice & beans  Wednesday_ Red or green chile burro with rice & beans  Thursday_ Chicken taco & chicken enchilada with rice & beans   Friday_ Two cheese enchiladas with rice & beans  With that all announced, to my amazement the 1/2 price appetizers are big portions and one dish seems to do the job ;) (satisfaction) By the way, they sell this really cool señorita/señor glass cups & every time you bring it back to the bar you get discounted on your margarita drinks (I think at a minimum of 2 servings)   Margarita Flavors: Strawberry, Mango, Peach, Melon, Raspberry, & Banana (I've tried all but banana & I'm in love)      Not to mention, the addicting chips & salsa served right when you're seated is just a teaser...   BE PREPARED TO GET YOUR MEXI GRUB ON! & ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had!!! Would rather eat food outta the garbage than come eat at this culinary disaster of a restaurant"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant for many  years. Tonight we had great service, our waitress Maria recommended the enchilada sampler and it was great. However, one of our favorite things is the chips and salsa. I noticed that the spicier sauce seemed watered down, and it had no consistency to it. I advised the bus person of this, and he agreed with me. He stated that other customers have complained as well, and that all of the salsa in the restaurant was the same way."}
{"text":"I was there today with my brother, who had fond memories of Macayo's from Arizona.  It was awful.  The food was INEDIBLE.  It tasted like something that would make you ill later if you actually ate it.  The first sign was the chips & salsa.  Chips ok - salsa looked like bottled taco sauce, very smooth and not chunky.  I ordered some kind of chimichanga with shredded beef - it tasted really bad, like it had gone off.  The atmosphere is a little run-down and the booths are kind of saggy and too far from the tables - like they get a lot of super fat people in there.  The food servers were very nice, so I feel bad for them to have to work in a place like that.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all.  Gross."}
{"text":"I debated giving this place one star, but I can't say that the food was gross. My boyfriend raved about this place so we decided to come her for dinner tonight. He hasn't lived here for a few years, and clearly things here have changed. Our margaritas were weak, with way too much sour mix. The salsa was the worst I have had in a mexican restaurant and was clearly from a can. If it wasn't from a can, I am fascinated that a human made fresh food taste like that. The queso tasted like cheese wiz with some rotel. Our mean was mediocre. The portion sizes were large, but what is the point if the food sucks? I ate half my burrito and didn't bother to take the rest home. Then we waited what seemed like forever for our check. Save your money and go to Taco Bell. Better yet, spend the same amount and go to Laticias for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, but let me tell you it was super good! I'm glad we decided to step inside. Very good customer service we were seated right away. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. (Which was very good too btw) our food was delicious as well! Really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food, affordable, great service, endless chips and salsa, the margaritas and daiquiris to die for. I love this place! If you have the chance to be served by Brandon you are definitely going to receive attentive service. He's wonderful!"}
{"text":"I come here because my mom and her friends would come here, before I was even born!! It has new management or owners, and it's just gone down hill since. People are not the same, food is not the same.. same with the drinks... I hate to say this, but i think today was my last time."}
{"text":"This place is so good. It's not authentic, who cares!! Just shut up and eat the great food! Order a TCT and make love to it with your taste buds. It's greasy and cheesey,  dip it in the smooth sauce like a boss and enjoy."}
{"text":"This is a very typical Mexican place.  Not upscale, buy not Taco Bell either.  Many things are likely from a can, the quality is minimal, the fat content is high but so is the flavor.  Macayo's is ideal for when you want some chips and various Tex Mex dips, tacos, burritos, chimichangas, etc. Our first trip to Macayo's was on a friends recommendation.  He had some margarita beverage-ware (silly looking clay cups with either a Mexican man or woman's torso with a cup on the head).  If you bring this cup with you, margarita refills are hella cheap.($3-4)  The service was fairly bad.  It was an hour before closing, yet the bartender's (male, did not introduce himself) actions made it pretty clear that he couldn't be bothered with us and was ready to go home.   He made assumptions (don't give me a frozen margarita just because I am a girl and then look put off when I insist on having it on the rocks) and skimped on every aspect of service.  Nevertheless, we had queso on the brain and were determined to stay and make the best of it. We had a trio of dips including spinach queso, chile queso, and beans for just under $10.  It was just what was needed and expected. I had vegetarian fajitas and was thrilled with zucchini, squash, broccoli, peppers, and mushrooms, but not so thrilled that more than half of my total veggies were onions.   The boys were all happy with their various tacos, nachos, and burritos.  Rob recommends the beef burrito.  For some reason, 2 of our friends decided to WAY over tip even though the service was hesitant at best.  Maybe next time this guy will remember us and be more attentive? My return trip several weeks later was much better!  Michelle being behind the bar brought happy, prompt service.  She clarified all of our orders---yes, I would like that on the rocks:) smiled, was well-informed on menu items, and had a general sense of pride in her job.   We repeated the tasty-fattening trio of dips and I remembered to order my  veggie fajitas sans onions.  Success! I can't give it more than 3 stars due to: Lack of ambiance and music(we played our own Pandora the first time) Low quality of ingredients, especially the pink/white tomatoes and iceberg lettuce. However, I will be back because sometimes you just need some crappy delicious Tex Mex and a margarita.      Happy hour $3.99 margarita $1.89 dips. Less than 5 for taquitos, chicken fingers, wings, mini-chimichangas.   $2-3 beer"}
{"text":"Coming from Texas I'm a snob when it comes to mexican food.  That's why I go with 4 stars.  I've tried a lot of places in town and this place is the best place to get mexican food in Las Vegas.  The queso is bomb!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant ever since I was kid. Honestly its because of their chicken fingers and homemade ranch. Its literally the best you'll ever taste. Don't get me wrong though, their other food is really good too."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a snob...but that was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!!! My husband is Mexican and we love Viva Mercados, but this was just all around nasty!  The salsa, beans, enchilada sauce...it seriously tasted like hospital food to me and I'm not joking!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh Macayo's my first job in Las Vegas, five stars for that!   Oh wait...you fired me! ( stars removed)  Ok Macayo, your on your own now, this review will be based solely on your own merits. 1.  Location. Nice building with ample parking love it. Star 2. Atmosphere. Clean and nicely decorated. Star 3. Food. Very consistent, love the seafood enchiladas, mini chicken chimichangas, and great sizzling fajitas. Star  4. Service. Nothin out of this world. Only what is expected. The girl with big boobs across my table did get extra exceptionally good service. Star 5. price. At around 8-15 for a meal? Star! I'm out of stars but the margaritas are a star of their own! I had a couple, few, some, of them before writting this so they may have had some influence on the result of this review. I may have make some changes tomorrow when my margarita goggles are off!"}
{"text":"A Las Vegas icon if you're a long time local. Grew up coming here every weekend as a teenager to eat free chips. The chips and salsa are always good but this is not real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I stopped going there a few years ago: Can you say \"Cheese?\" Way too much of it on everything. Maybe it's changed, but why spend the dough for food one can get elsewhere and better? (I just came back to this review because Yelp told me it was unfinished, whatever that means).  Because I'm intimidated by Yelp and women, I finish it with this: If you want a \"lump 'o cheese,\" and at best mediocre Mexican food, go and enjoy yourself. It is definitely better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"Macayo's is a chain but it is a staple of my visits to Vegas. Partly because it is about 2 blocks from my mom's house and partly because I absolutly LOVE their tortilla soup. It is super simple as it consists of broth, cheese and tortilla chips with a little bit of stewed tomatoes. No meat. I really like their chips and sauce. The chips are thin and they serve two different sauces. One is mild and slightly chunky and the other is a little hotter and smooth like a taco sauce. Both are good but I typically gravitate towards the hotter one or I combine them together. Also, can't pass up a margarita when I go with mom. If you purchase one of their margarita glasses you get a discount on the margaritas whenever you bring it back in. I bought one probably 20 years ago but never think to take it with me. Guess I should try to remember that next time I head to Vegas. Macayo's was a popular \"after football game\" hangout for high school students back in the 70s so it is always a little nostalgic for me to go there. Unfortunately, back then, I only ate burgers :("}
{"text":"shame on you the assholes that own this biz your father work hard to build, 40 yrs my family eats there 1-6 times a month, last time there all three of us got sick on enchilade sauce, story tells all, you place new onto old product in your items of need to make food from your kitchen, so i last person 9:00pm to order got old dangerous sick nasty sauce, you fucked me and my family you fucking assholes, shame on you go out of business and go to work at fucking taco bell motherfuckers"}
{"text":"Got one word YUMMM!!!  I love Mecixan food! I could live off of this food!  I went last thurs with a few friends of mine..(was before toy story 3 show)   We walked in with our stomachs growling.. the food smelled so good.. the lady got us seated instantly when we walked in.. wasn't busy at all.. so picked a good night too come in..we sat at a booth.. (very comparable) as soon we sat down our waitress was here instantly.. (that's what i call service)  she was sweet.. she asked us for our drinks.. i asked her for a Shirley temple..(has refills)  I usually get that drink when i eat Mexican food..lol than right after we got our chips and salsa was SO good!!!! I love there chips and salsa!  Beats Garcia's(from az)  if u want some good salsa and chips.. come here!!! Its free!!   Right after i pretty much filled up with chips and salsa..I looked at the menu.. everything looked good.. But i got a Cheese enchiladas with rise and beans..(my fave) was $11.00 it was kinda pricey.. but not bad..(hey if u wanna eat some good Mexican food.. gotta pay a little bit more)   waited..12 min.. than our food was out.. pretty good service..for serving 3 people at a table..   WOW! I can see the steam coming out of our food when that tray came out.. was hungery.. was nice and hot.. wasn't cold at ALL!  My stomach was so happy at the end of the day.. Good place for family and friends to eat.. Also for a date! I wanna come here with my hubby soon!!  Thank u guys!!! I will be back with my tummy rubbling!!!"}
{"text":"We go because we've gone since we were little. We go because of Cha Cha and Bob. We go for the world's most delicious chips and salsa. We go for the TCTs. We go because it's delicious. The new location is bright and clean. Service is quick and friendly. I love my cheese enchiladas! And I love to fill my Cha Cha's huge hat with margaritas. Cheers."}
{"text":"It was just ok . Very packed for Mother's Day which was completely expected and we actually got to sit in the bar area very quickly !!   Our server Manuel was amazing and very nice ! Made sure our drinks were full and that we got everything we needed.  The reason for the tree stars was based on the food . Very average! I had a sampler that was ok with many different items but kind of on the blander side ! My wife had a special enchilada the was good , the sauce was amazing!! My mom had the California Burrito and it was huge and she really liked it !!   The salsa was not that great and chips were very average but the queso  was good !!  Las Vegas has a ton of Mexican Restaurants but all are about the same as far as flavor goes !!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have experienced! I should have known how the service would be when it started by the phone call I made asking if they were open (making sure of closing time) and the woman straight hung up on me with out saying a word. When we got there the waitress (Maria) got upset because we asked for a refill on our drinks and then slammed the drink on the table and then smacked her hands down on her thighs. Other than her taking the order and us flagging her down to refill our drink, we didn't see her the rest of the night! After waiting for forever, we finally walked up to the front and asked for our bill ourselves. The lady upfront asked what table we were sitting at, printed a receipt, handed it to me to sign and that was it. No have a good night, thank you, how was your dinner...nothing. No communication at all! VERY disappointed and will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"Worse than I remember. Stale chips and rice with. An entree is an additional charge. The BBQ chicken salad was a hard piece of chicken on ice berg lettuce. Nice staff."}
{"text":"I am not impressed. Friendly staff, our server Brandon was very attentive and couldn't have asked for better. The food was so bland, with no seasoning. The salsa taste like it was from a jar. I would never come here again. They need to hire new cooks that can help them make a more authentic menu. The chimichanga is not fried, it's more like a grilled burrito."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was horrible. Everything was flavorless including the \"sauce\" that they use instead of salsa. This place is old and could use an update in decor and menu."}
{"text":"One word... Bleurgh What the heck happened to this place? The only good thing they have going for them are their chips."}
{"text":"What an awful experience. First we asked if there was anyway the kids soup and salad couldn't have beans instead of salad. She said no and then came up with a solution that would be close to 8 dollars for a four year old. No thank you. My husband and I ordered meals specifically because they came with guacamole. 25 minutes after our order was taken, we received our meals and told us there was no guacamole like it wasn't no big deal. They still charged my husband 10.79 for what then became nothing more than a bean and rice burrito we could have gotten at Del Taco for 4 bucks. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Well, this place went downhill prettttttty fast. Extracting the information out of our waitress made me feel like a CIA agent ready to water board somebody if they don't disclose what flippin flavors of margarita they offer, but don't print on the regular menu, and no longer have a drink menu....  After a long process of slowly piecing information from her I ordered the Cadillac margarita on the rocks which should be renamed salt water. Beyond that the chips were stale and flavorless, the salsa was watery and gross, the mini sampler appetizer featured an array of frozen mexican food from your local Costco microwaved especially for you. The enchiladas did not justify the clogged artery so I only ate about half of the first one. The server was nice and the guy refilling the water and chips was on the ball...except when he refilled friends root beer with pepsi."}
{"text":"Well, If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this isn't that restaurant.   The decor is cute, so I guess that's what the mandatory 1 star goes to.  You see, it was a birthday dinner so our table was about 14 deep. We advised the waiter who and what would be on which check UP FRONT. It's a pain to separate checks (some guests at our table being servers themselves) so we made sure to be patient and accurate so as to make everyone's lives a little easier.  The food came out, and my nachos were allllll cheese and meat. Nachos should be a balance of toppings!  My mom got fajitas and they were overcooked and mushy. The margaritas were weak and could have perhaps passed as salty virginitas. Again our table had 14 people so I won't bore you with the rest of the dishes.  Worst part, the checks... So the waiter comes back and starts writing down what we had on a big roll of receipt paper. What? No, I wanna go home now. This should be the easy part where you swipe my card and I tip you and I go.   I was the first to hand off my debit card. After over 15 minutes I went to check on my card, being as everyone else got theirs back already. After \"accidentally\" adding 3 different things to another guest's bill, they kept my card as a sort of \"insurance\" for if they couldn't figure out who the items belonged to. I was upset that there wasn't any communication on our waiter's behalf, because I'm a very understanding person. But to sit around while everyone else has left the table did not make me feel very good.   Unprofessional, unauthentic, unimpressive. You couldn't pay me to return."}
{"text":"All of these hit and miss reviews threw me, my friend looked them up before we went even though it was the Die's choice and we had to go either way and she said, well they have mixed reviews so we were a bit nervous for sure.  We were seated by a woman at the front desk, I admit she wasnt friendly at all, she didnt ask us if we had ever been there before or even say welcome to Macayos, she simply asked how many there were of us (3) and sat us.      Hugo was our waiter and he was the BEST!     Friendly, engaging and very helpful with the menu.   I was not sure about what to get and he suggested a few things, very good.  And they have Horchata, I wish they had agua frescas but they are hard to find it would seem.     The die made all of us get drinks so we all got soda (except for my horchata)  and then we ordered the TCT which I have seen on here and it was GREAT.      I had Cheese Relleno, Ground beef Tacos...refried beans and rice and for dessert fried ice cream.    We will be back!  Oh it was clean and comfortable too and the bathrooms were super clean!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Great atmosphere! The waiters are very polite and respectful. Great service!  The food is great.  The blended frozen strawberry margaritas, always made with patron tequila are to die for.  The fajitas are my favorite but the burritos and enchiladas are amazing too. Try the Baja enchiladas or burritos! Reasonably priced! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is terrible. I've been to this location twice for lunch. The first time I ordered a combo  plate with a taco and enchilada, and the second time beef fajitas. The chips and tortillas were stale and flavorless--obviously not freshly made, but bought from a restaurant supplier. The entrees were mushy and also lacked any seasoning. Both times the service was bad, slow and inattentive. It should not take 90 minutes to get your meal and drinks should be refilled at least once prior to requesting the check. For the price, I would have had a better meal at Chipotle or Zabas."}
{"text":"A wide variety of Mexican eats, fajitas, chimichangas, tacos, burritos, seafood, and salads. We were greeted with  chips with 2 salsas, chips were good, salsas were okay. My mini sampler was great, with 2 mini tostadas, 2 mini tacos, taquitos a chimi , and a small tamale. Serves with a tostada dish full of sour cream and guacamole. Server was efficient and checked on us a few times. A good experience!"}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa are great here. I'd come to Macayo's just for the hot smooth sauce!! Mmmm nom nom nom...."}
{"text":"Big disappointment food is not fresh tastes like canned tomatoes and instant rice.  Beans were microwaved before serving too. Place is not to clean either tables are sticky."}
{"text":"I love Macayo's! I try New Mexican places... and I always come back. Chips N Salsa is the best! You know that you are from Vegas if you have a love for Macayo's and their TCTs . You get plenty of food for your dollar. My favorites are the Tostada Del Mundo, Chimichangas, and the fajitas are my favorite.. also try the fried ice cream and the tortilla soup, not in that order though. All the other so so reviews, they're not from here"}
{"text":"Located in the University hood. Macayo Vegas serves pretty good Mexican chow. I had the enchilada sampler, which was good, but not quite a \"WOW\" experience.  Their chips and salsa are pretty good, their frozen margaritas are pretty good, the service is pretty good, etc.   I would return and try something else on the menu, but would not go out of my way to go here.    Not bad, but personally, I prefer Lindo Michoacan on East DI.  C+"}
{"text":"I went here by myself... They barely had a table for me.. The waitress looked run down... The Strawberry Margarita was LAME!!!  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't awesome either. The one on Charleston is way better the food was fantastic at that one.  Weird at how the food can be sooo different. I was really disappointed. I don't know if I will ever go back... Sad... It used to remind me of my Nana's cooking. Oh well.. they now have some of their sauces in the grocery store..I guess I will try those."}
{"text":"\"Macayo's is serving up the most white-washed Mexican food I've ever tasted\"  I couldn't agree with Cassandra B any more... except I think that is awesome. Look when I decide to get authentic Mexican food here are a list of places I don't look:  1. Summerlin 2. End of list  Growing up in Minnesota Taco Bell is \"too ethnic\" for my tastes so Macayo fits the bill for me perfectly. Add in its a 10 minute drunken stumble... err, walk home and I couldn't be happier.   I think you have to compare Macayo to other similar restaurants- Macayo is not as good as border grill, but it is WAY better than say Cantina Laredo or just about every other Tex Mex style restaurant in the state. So for those of you who don't authenticity check every restaurant you go to, here is the guide to Macayo for n00bs  Step 1: Margaritas. They have lots of them, frozen or on the rocks. Get at least 3  Step 2: Trio Dip- I love Queso. By Queso I mean the white cheese dip you get at some Mexican restaurants. Las Vegas appears to be a Queso wasteland (BTW if you are reading this and you know where to get White Cheese dip- NOT QUESO FUNDIDO thats gross- please send me a message and you can have my first born... and any other born for that matter). Macayo does not have traditional white queso but they do have yellow cheese dip that is certainly passable in a pinch. The trio comes with this dip, bean dip, and a combo cheese/spinach dip that is shockingly good. I say shockingly because who would ever think to ruin perfectly good cheese by adding spinach? Sorry popeye but that vile weed has no place on a plate destined for human consumption. I digress. Anywhoo you should be finishing your second margarita by the time you polish off this dip trio  Step 3: Entrees. They have a really big menu, however, there are only 2 correct choices of food to order; Fajitas or a Chimichanga. Lets start with the fajitas- not the best I've had but you get a crapload of pretty good food for the money. No real complaints. The chimi- these are really good. For those of you who don't know a Chimichanga is a burrito that is then fried, like french fries or anything edible in the south. They have a few different chimichangas but to be honest you should be on Marg 3 at this point and the subtle differences will probably be lost on you.    Step 4: If still conscious, return to step 1 and rinse/repeat.   Some people have said \"the salsa is bad\". They are exaggerating, its certainly passable. I have no idea if they make it in house or not ( I would guess not) but... its the free salsa you get at the beginning of the meal, its really not that important.   Others have said the service is bad, it never has been for me. I have been several times during busy hours and while the servers aren't like all over the place I never go more than a few minutes without water in my glass or chips on the table."}
{"text":"Walked in with my boyfriend, just us two. No one greeted us, no one said a word, nothing. Clearly there was a worker there who could simply have said \"we will be with you in a moment\".....nada. We left literally 1 minute later."}
{"text":"Macayos is what I would consider a TexMex style Mexican food. Are they comparable to say nearby Bonito Michocan? No. Cantina Laredo. No. How about Cantina El Dorado?  No. Why? Because they're all different styles of Mexican food. One is based on the state of Michocan style food, one specializes in organic, and the other is a trendy Mexican place. It's apples and oranges really.   With that said, I love all types of Mexican food. As mentioned, I think the fare at macayos is considered TexMex and I think it's perfectly acceptable in terms of flavor. It's not the best Mexican food in the world, but it's tasty and consistent.   What sets this establishment apart is the Baja sauce. I can't get enough of it... The menu states that it's spicy, but I beg to differ.  My southwestern taste buds think it to be nothing near spicy, but some may consider it mild. Only those w really sensitive taste buds would think it's spicy.   My fave menu items include the Baja burrito, Baja chimi, green chile burro, & enchilada sampler (request shredded beef). Their green sauce is tasty. Also fun, request the server to put green sauce and Baja sauce on your burrito for an awesome taste experience.   They service here is of regular quality.  On the last visit we sat in the dining area & a bus person had a tray full of chips and salsa asking if anyone needed refills. That's the first I've seen of that- it was a nice touch and improved customer service during the dinner rush.   I believe this chain are originally from Arizona. The restaurants there have outdoor seating and a slightly different menu (but very similar). I'm a little bummed the NV locations don't have outdoor seating like their AZ counterparts :-("}
{"text":"\"White-washed Mexican food\"? Yeah, kind of. Your options are already pretty limited in Summerlin, but any place that unapologetically serves medium jarred Pace salsa with store bought chips ranks pretty low on my revisit list.  Lunch combos are cheap, menu has a lot of choices. Stuck to fairly safe options, including a chile relleno (I liked the sauce but pepper was soggy and had no spice) and chicken enchiladas (bland and unmemorable), rice and beans did not stand out.   You can do worse for Mexican food, but you can also do better... maybe getting a margarita makes their food more tolerable. If I come back, it'll be for HH."}
{"text":"I love Macayos. I grew up in Vegas, and Macayos was always a special occasion. I love there chips and salsa. The hot sauce is the best tasting sauce ever. I eat it with a spoon after the chips are gone. The California burrito is the best, get it enchilada style. I've also heard their seafood is great.  I've never been disappointed going to Macayos."}
{"text":"Growing up in Arizona, I have eaten at Macayos a number of times, throughout Phoenix and Tucson. It is a favorite stop for our kids, namely because of the ambience. You don't feel uncomfortable if the kids get a little noisy.  From that perspective, this one did not disappoint. However, the recipes at this location were a little different. Most notably, everything was a little less spicy. I usually order the \"hot\" salsa to go with my chips, as well as a baja chimi. Based on my experience in AZ, I expected them to be relatively spicy. Instead, they were pretty bland."}
{"text":"I've been eating here all of my life and if I could I would rate it 10 stars!! While it's not your traditional Mexican food, it sure is tasty!! Be sure to try the TCT, your fellow patrons will thank you. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  Husband orered the carne asada burrito .. husband said it tasted like nacho cheese sauce was used instead of shredded cheese.  Combo meal was okay.  Got the chile rellano and a shredded beef sour cream green chile enchilada."}
{"text":"Good mexican food for a great price. It is a family friendly environment, sometimes a little too family friendly. The service is usually great and served quickly. Recommend if having a large event."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience here, but I kinda wanna taco 'bout it. (That was for you Rachel :))   Fail #1- Our party of 6 adults + a baby was shoved into a half booth that can only probably comfortably seat 4. Then a chair was added to the other side of the table to make extra room. I arrived a few minutes after everyone else and I would have requested to be moved if drinks/chips weren't already on the table. This seating arrangement was a cluster. There was hardly any room for ourselves let alone our food. I felt like a sardine in a can and I wasn't even sitting in the booth. Everyone's elbows were touching and there was no room for our plates. Most of us ordered the TCT which is a large tortilla with cheese and they come on these round metal trays and there was just no room at all.   Fail #2- Our server. He was nice and friendly but sucked at serving and that's a problem considering it was his job. There were 6 of us, not 15. It shouldn't be that hard. We had to ask multiple times for refills, sides of stuff we had ordered that had not arrived, etc. Food was dropped off to the wrong person and it was all quite annoying.  Fail #3- The food. To start I ordered the baja sauce to eat with my chips. The baja sauce is like a cream cheese jalapeno dip and it's amazing. I eat it with the bland tortilla chips they serve cause the \"salsa\" they serve you is actually just tomato sauce and it's awful. Anyway this sauce is supposed to come hot, but it arrived cold to the table. I sent that back right way and asked for it to be made hot. It was weird because the bowl it came in was hot, but the dip was not. If you eat here, make sure to ask for a side of that. For my entree I ordered the TCT with shredded beef, beans and sour cream on it. My friend ordered a TCT with shredded beef and sour cream but on the side. I received my TCT with all toppings on the side. Not that this was a big deal, but just another slight annoyance. The TCT is my favorite thing there, and it's just a big ass tortilla with cheese and toppings. If the best item is a damn tortilla with cheese, I would say that's a problem.  All in all, I would have to say this visit makes me not want to come back here ever again and that's sad! I've been eating at Macayo's for years. If you are looking for good Mexican food, I would say this is NACHO place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over 5 years, and I still love it to this day. I figured this a long overdue review. Here is what I have to say: the lunch menu is awesome for a quick in and out Mexican restaurant, and the staff is super friendly. I always come in at lunchtime, because I stay full until the late hours of the night. I do have to say my mex bowl today looked like it had a little less meat compared to other bows I have had, but it still filled me up. My dad and I enjoy coming here because we always love our waiters and waitresses. Hugo, you're the man! We have seen you for years, and always look for your smile. A major shout out to our waiter today, Charles! You were absolutely fantastic and funny! Thank you for constantly checking up on us. Tip: This isn't 5 star gourmet Mexican cuisine, it's just come as you are and enjoy our food. Enchiladas are always on point no matter what protein or sauce you get."}
{"text":"After class, I was picked up and taken away.  Surprise surprise.. They brought me to get a log.  I have driven pass this place multiple times and never took the time to stop by.  My first thought, 20% off for UNLV Students.. Score!  We came in for lunch, not too packed.  Very decent crowd for a weekday of course.  Place was very open ended.  Lots of tables and booths available.  We grabbed a booth and of course a bowl of chips and salsa arrived on cue.  Tasty chips, less salt, salsa was a little weak for me.  I need that hot stuff!    Lots of options for lunch of course with a special lunch price.  We all got different items.  I got the lunch burro (log).. Our server was very kind enough to have the cook put cheese on top so it was more appealing and looked more like a chimichanga.  At first sight.. I didn't think I would finish.. But, after a several bites and hot sauce.. I cleaned up pretty well.  No togo box necessary.  Shredded beef was delicious and the oozing cheese was wonderful.  Served on a hot plate of course.  I took a peek at what my friends had, very nice picks.  Plates look delicious as well.  May be a little less than what I was having of course.  They went with the 2 item options where they could pick up a taco, enchilada, tamale, etc.  But if you are an eater like me, better stick with the burro.    Service was on top.. I truly mean it because my water cup was constantly being refilled.  She offered to add syrup flavors to my friends lemonades.  Very nice of her and the fact that she offered to redo it if it doesn't turn out good.    Overall, I would come back to try out the other items.  Place had some slot machines and video poker.  Fire place was a nice touch.  I also noticed a bar area on the way out.  Parking is decent, doesn't look like it will be a problem.."}
{"text":"Not sure who's putting up these positive reviews...This place sucked. Service was slow and not at all friendly. I had a chicken chimichanga that was made with dried canned chicken and bland rice on the side.  My girlfriend had tacos that she said made Taco Bell seem like a viable option next time we're seeking Mexican food. I took a bite and agreed."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Totally delicious food at great prices. Seniors get 20% off. Lunch is one of the best deals in town with their 20% off deals. Never once had a bad meal there and everything I have ever tasted was fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"How dare you call this mexican food. This place is a disgrace to Mexicans. I didn't think ANYONE could mess up a taco, but sure enough I was proven wrong. I feel so bad for the wait staff working here....it's not their fault the food tastes like the inside of a gym shoe. The only people that would find this food good is the people that are deprived of the authentic goodness mexican food really has to offer."}
{"text":"While recently in Vegas, I decided to go back to and try an old love. No, not a strip club or girlfriend, Macayo's Mexican Restaurant.  And just like trying to resurrect an old flame, it fizzled and was extremely disappointing. Sometimes it's just better to remember the good times and move on.  Like love, our tastes change. Like love, one person matures, the other doesn't move forward. Macayo's is just bland. No spice. No atmosphere. Baby, you've lost that loving feeling.  Friendly service? Oh yeah...enthusiastic server? Oh yeah. But now, this place is better suited for those palates who prefer plain. Period."}
{"text":"I've been eating at MacoVegas since 1974. I have never had a bad meal. The abondagas soup is the best in town! The margaritas are also the best. I really wish they would open a new restaurant in the centennial area!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously AMAZING!!!! Linda is my new favorite server in Vegas......Friendly, knowledgeable! The foood was OUTSTANDING! And the whole staff came out to sing \"Happy Birthday\" (much to the embarassment to my 15 year old daughter!!!) Will for sure go back....the food, YES....But just to be around the people that work there..HELL YEAH!!!  Nice job, Macayo's for having the BEST service and staff I have seen in a long time!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay doesn't compare tp Lindo Michocan.   Service was okay too, the waitress we had was good with her customer service.   Got our food fast and were able to eat and get out of there without hassle.  Recommend this as a cheaper option to Lindo Michocan."}
{"text":"I have been to this Macayo several times for lunch as it's pretty close to my office.  They have lunch specials that run around $8.  The chips and salsa are decent, and I've liked all of the entrees that I've tried. Their chicken tortilla soup is pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Macayos is a Vegas institution. Been going overall since I was two. This location has been here for about 20 years.   We're regulars and know several of the staff by name. Service can sometimes be hit and miss but nothing has ever driven us away from Macayos and it likely never will."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents the other day because they had a coupon.  I ordered the shrimp verde enchiladas. When they arrived, they were chicken. I called the waiter over and told him I couldn't find any shrimp in my shrimp enchiladas. He apologized and got me a new order...which had shrimp. The enchiladas were okay but I probably wouldn't order that again.  My mom had Baja enchiladas which she loved. My dad also liked his beef taco and Baja burrito.  We all got the chicken tortilla soup to start, which was very good.  I wasn't overly impressed with my meal but may have just ordered the wrong entree.  The salsa served with the chips was less than stellar."}
{"text":"Great food!!! The carnitas were so delicious!!! Quesadillas were great!!! The sampler plate with appetizers was yummy!!! Cool decor!! We love it here!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious just the taste I wanted.  Baja sauce super flavorful.  We had chimichangas shredded beef and chicken with rice and beans.  Rice was super fluffy.  Jay was our server really sweet talked about the history of this place and talked about Vegas.  The service was 5 star and quick. We will return here when we come back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the Las Vegas area for a convention and were looking somewhere off-strip to eat. Our Lyft driver recommended us Macayo's. It was a little far from the strip, but we were glad we made the 20 minute trip out to the restaurant!  The server was awesome. The food was delicious. And the price was right! I would definitely recommend this establishment if you were looking for some Mexican food, definitely check out this place.  4 out of 5 stars. Great food. Good prices. Friendly service. Definitely will make my way back. I think we would have enjoyed the restaurant more if we weren't in a hurry to get back to the strip for an event."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Others may be more authentic but this place hits the spot. Service is always great and the food is delicious! You can't beat happy hour food and drink specials until 6pm either! Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why so many people are ragging on this place. I've been coming here every time that I come to Vegas.  Yes, the decor inside is a little \"old\" and yes so are the waitresses, but don't knock that down before you get to the awesome menu.  To me, it's just a vendor serving up some good, local comfort food.  Try coming for lunch as they have an affordable menu and plenty of tables available in the area."}
{"text":"This is the 'Mexican' food I was raised on, peeps.  Macayo's is mother's milk to Vegas natives - at least to really, really Irish Vegas natives who consider the food at Macayo's 'Mexican.'  The poor waitresses are decked out in pink and blue flowing Mexican stylr dresses that are purely horrid.  They serve up RC cola, which makes me laugh.  The food really ain't that bad, but it really ain't that special either.  The chips and salsa still delight me to this day, though.  And not many things beat getting a TCT.  (Toasted Cheese Tortilla.  It's a giant quesadilla, besically, and they bring it out on a pizza sheet and rest it above the candle on the table that has a constantly low flame and can't really keep it heated anyway.  But man, that there's comfort food.)  I can't help it.  A part of me will always have random cravings for a little Macayo's, no matter how old or high-falutin' I might get."}
{"text":"My wife enjoyed the chicken burrito, but my combo fajitas was really flavorless. The pieces of chicken and shrimp were a nice size and pretty tender, but the beef was not particularly appealing. And everything was bland and had no real taste. Even the onions and peppers. The whole dish was just blah."}
{"text":"Waited at the bar for a half hour for a table which wasn't a problem cause the drinks were good. Finally got a table but the server was very rude. I simply asked \"what's good here\" he replied with \"the carnitas\" and walked away. Thankfully we got chips and salsa for the half hour wait for the food only for the server to come back over and tell one of us they were out of tamales and said \"what else you want\"  After that we decided to leave. I've worked in restaurants for a while and chose not to pay a penny for our experience. I'm sure if we had another server we would have enjoyed everything but def won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great food. Comfortable atmosphere. Excellent service. Perfect for our big family meals. Love the TCTs - an old Vegas favorite."}
{"text":"Second time coming here, still amazing food and service. Linda was great!!!   This time I remembered to order my enchilada with green sauce, it was so good and flavorful. My chicken taco was light and crispy and overflowing with inside stuff. I rarely finish my plate of food but it was gone, lol.   Husband's beef fajitas smelled amazing as usual with all the side fixings.   Will be returning! Consistency is nice in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks back.  Have to rave about the chicken poblano, totally delicious.  If your a fan of chili relenos try this version!  Nice decor, friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I really dislike this restaurant. The food was flavorless and we waited a really long time for our food which is weird considering it was not crowded. I've never tasted guacamole so plain and flavorless and the fajita I ordered was also less than tasty.  Will not return even if it was free."}
{"text":"Worst taco I ever ate. Tortilla was very hard and must have been cooked and stored for several days before filling it with meat and lettuce.  Won't be going back. ."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a place in las cruces, NM called la posta! It looks like you're sitting inside of someone's backyard eating and drinking!   The food was good but not true Mexican food. I think this place is more of like American-Mexican food rather than true hole in the wall Mexican food. Our waitress brought out the wrong order and she was so sweet because she let us keep the meal anyway. You're seated at your table then greeted with a bowl of tostada chips and salsa. Okay y'all, this salsa isn't true Mexican salsa. It tastes like pace salsa and red sauce. The salsas and pico I have tried have seeds in it, charred pieces from the cast iron skillet and a taste of homemade salsa and pico.   The amount of food they give you are very generous portions though. If you get an appetizer, I HIGHLY suggest getting the chicken wings! They are crispy with that nice crunch you're looking for when you eat wings! That's my first favorite. We left with 3 freaking to-go boxes! It looks like we didn't even eat! We also got their deep fried ice cream for dessert and it was good! It's a ball of vanilla ice cream coated in like corn flakes and honey mixture and places in a flat cone on the plate. I think I would have to say that was my second favorite because I was craving ice cream!  All in all, I don't think this place would be my first choice for Mexican food. It kind of reminds me of Applebee's or chili's for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is always great here, but every empty table in the dining room was dirty and it wasn't that busy.  The bathrooms were clean though.  Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I have lived in Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas for most of my life and feel I am a good judge of Mexican food.  This restaurant is better than many of the reviews but they are dead on with regard to the salsa.  Bland isn't even an adequate description for this tasteless red sauce.  The chips were OK.  Liquor, to me, isn't a way to judge a restaurant but is important for a tavern or bar so I don't include this in my evaluation.  Our server, Linda, was one of the best I have had.  Our glasses were filled frequently and Linda was checking on us with regularity.  The chicken in the Chicken Enchilada was fresh and properly prepared.  The enchilada itself could have been spicier but the freshness made up for it.  The other dishes around the table were good, but not great.  The re-fried beans were good.  The rice was average.  This is a nice restaurant for the less adventurous."}
{"text":"I have been going to Macayo's since I was a toddler. It is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, and I've tried almost all of them.   Parking is a pain at this location, and getting in and out of the parking lot is a little dangerous, but totally worth it!  The Sahara location always seems to be loud, they always have parties going on, but it doesn't take away from the atmosphere at all- it adds to it!   I loooove the Tostada Del Mundo! It's one of the best things on the menu!"}
{"text":"After a few visits with my family, and then with my family and friends, it's review time!  Overall, this could be one of any number of Mexican restaurants, but I'm giving it fours stars for a few reasons.  Read on...  The food.  I've tried two things on the menu and both were delicious:  the Street Tacos (with carnitas as the choice of meat), and the Spicy Chilorio.  The street tacos were on flour tortillas instead of corn, but this was a pleasant change.  And the amount of meat on them was very generous and very delicious.  I was stuffed and very happy.  The Spicy Chilorio was actually mild, but still very delicious.  This is definitely a new favorite comfort food, perfect with the tortillas on the side and begging to be ordered on a chilly day.  Fresh chips and two kinds of salsa are there for you to enjoy while you wait for your food, and after ordering, everyone's orders came out together and in a very reasonable amount of time.    The staff.  Both visits included an incredibly nice staff, from the person who seated us to the waiters and waitresses that took care of us at the table.  As you know, even the best of food served by bad staff is ruined.  That's not a problem here--great staff!  The decor.  I believe it's pretty standard for this chain, but it's nice and not necessarily \"standard\" in terms of other Mexican restaurants.  With artwork painted on the walls instead of just framed pictures, it's a very nice change of pace.  Everything is also very clean and in good repair.  Parking.  There's lots of parking around the restaurant.  Take note that the entrance is on the west side of the building and not on what I would have thought was the front (facing Sahara Blvd).  Frankly, with the entrance where it is, it's more convenient relative to where you'll probably park.  Not much more to say other than I'll definitely go back regularly, and I hope to see you there too!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food  We recoment the nacho's  lunch order was more than we could eat. We shared an order.  we had eaten there year ago. We would eat there as regulars but we are from Florida. Carolyn our very good and helpful server said the lunch order came all decked out, the dinner Nachos are chips and cheese or build your own.  Lunch for 2 was $13.48."}
{"text":"Macayo's oh Macayo's, how I do love you so so MUCH.  I have been going to Macayo's for over 15 years of my life.  When I moved away it was the very first place I requested to go when I got off the plane.  My grandma knew almost all the staff, which were extremely friendly by the way!   My favorite thing to get here is the bowl of albondigas  soup and a large TCT; *drool*.  I have tried other things of course such as the yummy cheesy enchiladas, the big tasty chimichangas, and rolled tacos.  I have never experienced bad soup, chiladas, or TCT; and I'd say I have been well over 200 times so that's a pretty good record.  I must say though, hence why I had to minus a star, there have been a handful of times when I have gotten chicken items to find it was over cooked and flaky.  I would have to say it's hit or miss; but the other three items- you just cannot go wrong.    Hawg dawg, now I need to go get some! :D"}
{"text":"Came across this little gem when my mother in law ordered take out from them, never ate it, then left it behind, (her bad.) From the look of her entree, (beef enchiladas, with rice and beans,) I was in for treat. That was until I put it in the microwave to heat it up, layed down, and passed out for the night. When I woke up the next morning I was so mad at myself. To make a long story short, I had to hunt their location down because my mother in law didn't remember the name of the restaurant. She did however remember the whereabouts of their location. Didn't take long to find them after a google search and yelp investigation. I ended up ordering the same thing I missed out on and it was DELICIOUS!!!!! My husband had their chicken burrito and he was greatly satisfied as well. All in all, they were worth the hunt and I look forward to trying them again."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied with one of my favorite restaurants! My boyfriend and I are regulars at this restaurant and we really had a taste for Mexican ...My Boyfriend wanted a shrimp burrito but prepared like fajitas with green bell peppers and red bell peppers with grilled onions. He didn't want seasoning on the shrimp because he has a special diet and diagnosed with diverticulitis. He cannot eat anything with seasoning seeds or nuts. His stomach can't handle it. I had a taste for nachos or enchiladas. The cashier that was taking our order to go we didn't want to dine in said she would have to Check with the cooks first to see if they could prepare my boyfriends burrito without seasoning . The manager eventually came over and clarified that they could make it but after checking to see what they had in the freezer she discovered they were running out of bell peppers they only had a small amount of green ones and no red ones . How do you run out ? She said the shipment would not be coming in until the next morning . I couldn't believe this but unfortunately we ended up leaving and going down the street to Nacho Daddy. Unfortunate because their food is not even comparable it was awful no flavor and cold . All we wanted was our favorite Mexican restaurant to come through for us ."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Tex-Mex.  There are a lot of reviews here that call Macayo's \"Americanized\" or not \"authentic.\"  To that I say, yeah baby!  That's just what I want.  Not soaked with heat, or drenched in lime juice, or loaded with cilantro, or otherwise messed up in any of the myriad ways that various Mexican restaurants around town have found to make their food damn near inedible to my taste.  Just good solid flavors that are exactly what I expect from each dish.  And despite the iffy Yelp! reviews, I can't be the only one because after many decades the place is still packed.  Tasty, comfortable, convenient, and cheap - this is exactly the Mexican place we were looking for when we moved here from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Macayos all my life and it is one of my favorite restaurants to frequent in the Vegas valley. They do Mexican food and they do it pretty well. I most often order the fajitas to share with someone and they are always delicious!   Lots of complaints in these reviews about the chips and salsa, but personally I love the chips and especially love the smooth salsa."}
{"text":"Tried this Mexican restaurant the other night. I always said \"need to try it\" because the building attracted me by it colors. The entrance doors are strange, feel like doors to enter a club of something. We were greeted by a nice lady as soon we entered the restaurant. We decided to go to the bar. The restaurant is simple, maybe too plain in my opinion. Bar is nothing fancy, Happy Hour served from 3pm to 6:30pm. We ordered 3 items from the Happy Hour Menu. Jalapenos queso, Mini Chimichanga (beef or chicken options) with side of sour cream and guacamole and some Sonoran Wings. I was little disappointed by the Jalapenos queso, looked like it was a can of melted cheese :( My wings were OK, not too spicy. Usually i always finish my wings but not this time. The salsa the waiter brought us wasn't \"home made\" either :( We ordered a Corona and an IceTea.  I spent $15 so for that price, why i am complaining about???  I added a star because of the price and have to mention that The service was Excellent, staff were very nice as well ...  I was curious we tried and not sure if I will eat there again."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. Ordered to go. Food was frozen when we went to eat it less than 5 minutes later and it wasn't made correctly. Instead of trying to fix the problem, we were told it was our fault it was cold because they told us it would be ready in 15 minutes and we showed up in 20 minutes. Also we were told it was cold because I added sour cream and guac to the burrito. Any other restaurante I've been to that adds those sides seems to be able to serve the food warm. Customer service was awful and the food didn't ever taste semi-good. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal patron of Macyo's since before I was even born, yet tonight I was rather disappointed with my margarita. It tasted like straight sweet and sour mix. The food is always good, but when a Mexican restaurant can't get a margarita made right, there's a really big problem."}
{"text":"Well, at least the Sahara location is a lot better then the E Charleston location.  The servers were nicer, the restaurant was cleaner, and the Happy Hour in the bar was good"}
{"text":"Well the food wasn't horrible but it wasn't the best Mexican food either.  What I didn't however find very dis tasteful was that when i placed my order,  I ordered a TCT,  one carne asada street taco and my husband ordered a plate of tacos.  When my order came he brought out two full orders of tacos,  I immediately explained that I only ordered 1 taco.   He said don't worry,  I won't charge you the whole plate,  just the taco rice and beans which is what I ordered.  I said okay.   I ate only one taco.  He gave me a box to take home the rest.   I put it away in the box neatly. He later came and took the box away and said there has been a mistake I can't give you the food,   At this point we were just waiting for our check.   We said, we don't mind paying for it.   He took it anyway,  he went toward the front desk and was speaking with the cashier,   The cashier proceeds to tell me that they have now deducted the other tacos from my order.  I said okay no worries,  we aren't trying to get anything free we will pay for it,  it's fine.   She replies with we took it off.  The waiter again gives me the box of food to go again!  I said okay thank you.   Then when I pay the cashier took it from my hands and says no,  we took it off. I found their miscommunication toward us very rude and offensive.  We offered to pay for the food and they never gave us that option.   We had the food in had twice and TWICE they took it away.  Who does that!!! For this behavior I am giving this establishment a bad rating.  This was our first time here.   We were excited to eat here and now we will never come back! This food is going in the trash.  They could have just left it alone, acknowledged their mistake and let us go on about our day.  So rude! Kyle was our waiter and i didn't catch the cashiers name.  I will be calling the manager about this as well."}
{"text":"Haven't been here sincere early 90's. Now I recall why.   Flavorless, run down needs updating"}
{"text":"My best friend loves this place and I really cannot understand why. Every time we have gone, the customer services is awful. They are rude and take forever! They always get the check wrong! She loves the food, I find it to be mediocre. Not bad but not good. Nothing special. Though the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Always love the Baja Beef enchiladas, and the bean dip.  Not the best Mexican food in the city, I mean that would be an insult to Lindo's or Roberto's or even Juan's Flaming Fajitas, but in a pinch it does the job.  Service is usually ok, but something was off this last visit.  No one was at the hostess station, like as in an actual hostess...and people were just standing around perplexed.  After waiting for about 5 minutes, mind you several waitresses and waiters walked by the station and not one of them asked if anyone had been helped, a lady came over and got us seated.  We found out shortly after seating she wasn't the hostess, only because the hostess magically appeared and berated the lady who seated us RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.  Way uncomfortable.  Way.  Hopefully it was just a kurfunkel and it'll be different next time around, because when I need Baja Beef I need Baja Beef."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town hands down. I've been eating it since I was little. I've gone there enough to know the service depends on the person but their chips and salsa, oh my word. I could go there and just eat those.   My favorite thing to get is the tacos authenticos. I can split it with someone and I can kinda built my own tacos.   To finish your meal I recommend the churros. They make the prefect ending. Their French vanilla ice cream is delicious in top."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Surprised to see a lot of negative reviews.  I have to say there were some things on the menu  am not so crazy about but I think it depends on what you order.  My go to's include the spicy chicken wings which are very flavorful and not to spicy to where you can't enjoy it.  They give you more than enough and are lightly breaded so not your typical wings you get from a bar.  Their blue cheese is not good nor the ranch so don't bother.  The sauce is all you need.  The shredded beef burrito enchilada style is very good.  They are more than generous with the beef and it is TASTY!  My wife loves the chips and salsa there but I really don't, salsa is too bland and runny for me.  Now the absolute MAIN reason to go here is the TCT appetizer.  It is to die for.  Personally, I just get it \"cheese only\" but you can put anything you want on it from meats to source cream, guac, tomatoes, etc.  Just try it with cheese only and dip it in the \"smooth sauce\" they give you with the chips and salsa.  It is soooooooo good!  Happy dining!"}
{"text":"I love their food, especially the chicken Baja burrito. The Baja sauce is outstanding! And I love the refried beans. It's hard to find good refried beans in Vegas. It is my favorite Mexican food.  With that being said, my biggest complaint is that I do not like their chips and salsa. It's been the same for 15 years - I didn't like it then and I still don't like it. But because I like their food so much we keep going back.   The atmosphere is a bit old school. I like it but think that it does need some updating. They used to have great coupons in the newspaper but they stop doing that quite some time ago - bummer! We don't go nearly as much."}
{"text":"I think I've had my last mediocre experience with Macayo's to last me and justify finding a new restaurant.  A friend and I went to this location for dinner recently.  We were seated in the normal dining room section...and then left for ten minutes.  Well, during that time we perused the menu and picked out exactly what we wanted.  When the waitress finally approached our table, she took our drink orders and then left before we could give her our appetizer or entre order.  She came back fairly quickly with our drinks, took our appetizer order and then left again.  As we were waiting for our appetizer order (a cup of queso dip) I heard her approach the recently seated people behind me and ask them for their drink order.  The woman had indicated that they were ready to order their food also, so she prepared to take their order.  These are people that were seated after us.  At this point, I heard the party behind us inquire about the queso dip and the waitress responded, \"These girls over here just ordered queso, so when it's done, I'll bring it by your table first so you can see what it looks like.\"  Really?  I've already waited long enough and I'm pretty hungry, but I have to wait longer for you to bring an item I'm paying for to another table for a display reason?  She finally came back to get our actual orders and I requsted a grilled chicken quesadilla with no peppers or onions, just chicken and cheese.  The waitress asked me...\"so, you don't want the chicken we normally prepare with the onions and peppers?\"  No, I just said that I didn't want that.  When our food came out, my plate only had the quesadilla, no sour cream, no quacamole...nothing.  I stopped her and asked if she could bring me a side of sour cream and she says...\"I thought when you said no garnishes that you meant everything.\"  Ok, first off, I never said \"no garnishes.\"  I said that I didn't want onions or peppers IN my food.  She also failed to honor my friend's request that they prepare her enchilada with extra sauce.  I think I'm just sick of getting ready to go out and paying for the experience, just for it to be so mediocre.  I know how to make a quesadilla and how to make an enchilada, next time I'll just stay home and do it all myself."}
{"text":"A real popular place among the UNLV students. I've been here many times but I'll focus on my visit last night.  Hostess staff was not very friendly at all. There were two standing up there doing something with the cash register and completely ignored me and my party. Waited two minutes until a 3rd hostess appeared out of nowhere and promptly seated us. The other two girls never even made eye contact.  Like most Mexican restaurants you get complementary chips and salsa. They provide two types of salsa - a mix between mild and medium that is going to be way too hot for the strictly mild crowd, and a weak hot variety.   Our server was very nice and attentive throughout the meal. The food here is always delicious, and made well - but it's nothing to rave about. It's your typical Mexican fare with plenty of options. The decor is warm and inviting. It appears that you're eating outside in a Mexican cafe, with adobes and faux porch lined balconies.  If you want good, authentic Mexican food ( and even some American choices such as chicken fingers,) you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and not worth the high price. The waiter was rude and had a bad attitude from the beginning. The bus boys did most of the work and they were the best thing about this place. We were very disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner the food was below average as was the service. I would have liked to have desert but since a waitress would have been required to order it I was out of luck as she never showed again after the food was served.  After waiting forever for a check we finally went to the register and asked if we could pay.   No tip was left which is rare for me."}
{"text":"I really dislike Macayo's but my mom loves it and her birthday is about the only reason we step foot in this place anymore. Considering how dead it was at 6:30, I'm guessing I'm not the only one who's not a fan. It's really no surprise the Decatur location closed and with so many good eats around this one, I'm willing to bet they're hurting too.  Every time I come here, the food just seems to get worse and worse. The chips are usually decent but this time around they were cold and stale. My wife ordered tortilla soup and a fajita quesadilla and I decided on the Baja chimi. If you look at the photo, you can see how greasy the soup was and her fajita was even worse...she picked up a piece and it was completely soaked. Luckily she had already filled up on stale chips and TCT so she didn't have to eat much. The Baja chimi was ok but the tortilla also tasted stale and to say the shredded beef lacks flavor is putting it lightly.   If you're in the mood for Mexican food, don't waste your time with Macayo's. There are much better places in town, many of which are the same price or even cheaper! The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is they made a pretty decent margarita and our waitress this time around was very friendly. The food is barely worth one star and until the next birthday, I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has been around since I was in high school and the food is still the same. Just a good staple. I give it 5 stars for consistency."}
{"text":"As a born and raised Las Vegan, I've been going to Macayo's since I was a kid. It is pretty much the native's standard for Americanized Mexican.   My faves... Spicy Chilorio, a delicious mix of creamy cheese, chiles, onions and either shrimp or chicken. Served with a large helping of beans and a side of tortillas it's like a heartier, more delicious chile con queso.  Baja Chimichanga A huge chimichanga smothered in ranchero sauce as well as their classic, sour cream-based spicy Baja Sauce.   While some locations have closed over the years and the menu has had slight tweaks, Macayo still provides that comforting taste we grew up with."}
{"text":"During one of our visits to this location, I ordered a dish, but without chicken, as I was trying out a vegetarian diet at the time. The waitress brings it out with chicken. I politely remind her that I had ordered it without. She argues with me and tells me, \"No, you ordered this with chicken!\" Shocked that she's arguing with me, I incredulously reply, \"I'm on a vegetarian diet, why would I order it with chicken?\" She gave more attitude and we talked about not going back.  A few months went by and we decided to give this location one more chance. Our food was terrible (overcooked, etc). We asked to swap out our entries. My wife, on the way back to our table from the bathroom, overheard the waiter making fun of us for being too picky. Who does that? How can such a person even have a job as a waiter? Hopefully, he got a job picking up trash on the side of the road and no longer works there. But we'll never know because we are never ever ever going back to Macayo's.  In summary: poorly prepared food and even worse service. Save yourself a trip. If you want to know what it's like dining here, just stay home, microwave a burrito, and repeatedly smack yourself in the face with it."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday as this was what she was craving. There were two babies in the group, which is fine because this is seemingly a family restaurant. I needed to change my son, but they don't have a family restroom or a changing table in the bathroom. I thought that couldn't be right, but after asking an employee this was confirmed. I ended up having to take my son out to my car on a cold night to change him. None of the employees seemed to care.  After this wonderful start to the dinner, things didn't get much better. Our chips didn't get refilled, neither did our drinks. The food was OK, at best. Our server was friendly, but it wasn't enough to salvage the night.   This place used to to be nice, but no more."}
{"text":"I love this place. I grew up coming to Macyos since I was little. Use to go to the one on Charleston until it close. Such a great family place kids can be loud and have fun. I started bring my kids to keep the tradition alive."}
{"text":"My wife and myself been coming here for along time and I have to say I'm gonna give it only one star. Reason being is the bar area. If you sit in the bar be prepared to get ignored by your server and the helper. There were only three different tables with people and only around 8:30 pm  ( they close at 10 ) and the server couldn't even keep up with that!!  We ran out of chips early and boom.....nobody around!  How convenient.  Both server and helper. GONE.  must have been break time.  I always hate when \"you\" the guest has to ask for something ie: drinks, extra, ect...WTF??!! I did notice even the servers had to wait on this person to make drinks for other tables. I love this place but, better stick to sitting in the regular room.."}
{"text":"I came here while on vacation because my aunt and grandma always come here. We were sat right away and the decor reminded me of my favorite childhood Mexican restaurant.  I love chips and salsa, but their salsa was not good. Neither impressed me. The chunky one tasted like Pace, the thin one tasted like enchilada sauce.  We ordered the chili queso dip and it was SOOO good! I ordered pollo con Espinaca which was pretty good. Tortillas were great, beans and rice were average, the sauce was amazing, but the actual meat wasn't. The sauce would be amazing if it was on fresh grilled chicken breast, but the chicken that I had tasted like frozen precut strips like from a lean cuisine meal. It was rubbery and not great.   My dad got the fajitas and said the meat was flavorful, but veggies were overlooked. I personally like soft veggies, but to each his own!  I would come back and try a burrito or just come for the chili dip and drinks!"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour. Had a couple cold dos equis. Ordered the two taco combo meal with ground beef. The beef was a little bland. I had to put salsa on to add flavor. The chips were a little stale but all in all it was a good meal not a great one. Wife had California burrito. It was huge and she had leftovers. She also mentioned it had way to much sour cream on it. But hers was also good."}
{"text":"The service wasn't the best... I understand it was a Friday night, but we had to get their attention if we wanted something. And the food wasn't the greatest. I have had better Mexican food."}
{"text":"Haven't been in for awhile because of bad experience with service and food...well nothing has changed...Food was not great and the server was terrible. It was at 1:30 so it wasn't that busy...will never go back"}
{"text":"Andy and I sat at the bar tonight and the experience was almost impossible to describe. When we approached the bar the \"bartender\" Maxine says \"it's dirty\" so we sat down while she cleaned the bar. No hello, no I'll be with you in a moment... Nothing. The busser grabbed us waters and the hostess grabbed us menus. We were considering ordering margaritas but then witnessed Maxine dumping a new batch of margarita mix into the old container.... The date was just a little over 2 weeks old on the container. That's when we should have left... We ordered a 3 item como. Two shredded beef tacos and a cheese enchilada. The tacos were sour... Not a great taste for beef. The enchilada was Luke warm. We barely ate half the meal and asked for the check. We were never asked how it was. Over all the bar was disgustingly dirty, the food was terrible and the service even worse. Were honestly worried about getting food poisoning. This was my favorite restraunt as a kid, this expierence makes me very sad and disappointed. I will never return."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican restaurant. Chips were stale, the quality of food is trash so disappointed. El pollo loco is better then this. I recommend the word authentic to be out of there menu."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vega$, I decided to try some local restaurants off \"the Strip\" for a change...partly to experience something new & also because it was a Sat & I detest the \"weekend & holiday\" price gouging at the casinos.  How dare you take such beautiful words as an excuse to jack the price of the buffet line when it's the same weekday food anyway!  Driving down Trop Ave I noticed the banner hanging out front proudly mentioning a \"Best of Las Vegas\" award (albeit from 2010)...but would standards change in that short a time?  Maybe this raised my expectations.  I arrived bout 11:30am & was given the lunch specials menu insert, but decided I would try some breakfast since it was still late morning.  Selection was sorta limited...there were two choices.  Chorizo & eggs & Hueveos Rancheros.  OK, not many choices, but granted they don't open til 11am, so demand for break is probably minimal.  Got the Huevos Ranch.  Just two (small to med sized) eggs on a tortilla...would it break to bank for the ownership to put large or XL eggs on a dish that costs 10 bucks w/tax?  And on the side (Wait for It!) some beans (refried) Rice? no. Sour Cream? no. Some cheese sprinkled on the pintos? no.  Maybe a lettuce & tomato garnish on the side? no.  And maybe a pipe dream of a real ranchera sauce stead of the lame canned salsa?  I told the waitress I needed some rice & she obliged...but it was kinda crunchy.  Ok guess the cook hadn't had a chance to cook some fresh stuff for the day & just grabbed what was left from the night before (albeit dried out enough that you could hurt your teeth.)  Even though she didn't charge me for brittle rice, the bill came to nearly 30 bucks w/tax & tip for the huevos, guacamole (3) coffee (3), & albondigas soup (Carrots? no. Sprig of celery? no. Mex chayote squash? pipe dream.) Granted the cook didn't have a total aversion to vegetables...the soup bowl had the equivalent of one onion ring in it.  Not that there's anything wrong w/ dropping 30 for breakfast for one(well maybe there is, but that's a different discussion) but it shouldn't have the minimal garnishments & burnt tasting coffee in one of the supposed culinary capitals of the country."}
{"text":"I just started here on yelp! And I've been to Macayos quite a few times and every time I go I love it more and more. Prices are good and the food.. It's amazing. I plan on going back AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend. I chose the nachos and I have to say, I could've made better ones at home. The waiter was very nice and attentive, I won't be back, though."}
{"text":"The beef chimichanga was not at all what I expected.   It was more like a giant hamburger stuffed burrito.  Yuk.  They did take the item off my bill, but my meal was ruined."}
{"text":"Salsa is still terrible..not fresh..tastes canned.  My favorite dish is chicken poblano..tastes amazing but it keeps getting smaller and smaller, this last visit was ridiculous..half normal size...mini poblano?? The calif. Burrito is other fav.  It's huge but this time it was soggy...gross! Tip: if you are a sr. Ask for a 20% off sr card.   This visit failed..not in a hurry to rush back."}
{"text":"The food, drink and service were just OK.  I had some of the Toasted Cheese Tortilla, some of the Trio Dip, the Tilapia Fish Tacos (lunch menu) and a Margarita.  The only time I eat here is when my sister visits Las Vegas, because she and her high school friends have fond memories from the 1970s of hanging out at the other, now closed, locations."}
{"text":"Anyone that grew up here in Vegas has most likely grown up going to Macayo's. I was upset to find out that the one on Decatur closed down since this is the one I grew up going to with my family.      I was pleasantly surprised to when I got to this one with my wife because of how nice, new and clean it looked compared to the other ones around town. It was clean with a nice friendly staff who were attentive but not over bearing and very friendly.     The food was good of course. I got the Beach Tacos which were chicken tacos on flower tortillas with rice, pico, lettuce and cheese with a chile-lime ranch... Amazing      If you go you also have to make sure you order TCT its what they are known for( besides their Margaritas and Pina Coladas)     Overall I was very pleased with the new Macayos and will definitely be back. Gracias Senor"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Macayo since they opened their first one on E. Charleston, then moved to Tropicana and Paradise, then Tropicana and Maryland Pkwy. We love everything. Of course we always start wit TCT, I'm partial to chimichangas or fajitas. My hubby loves chorizo soft taco, chili relleno, and cheese enchiladas. My mom loves chicken Assad with all the trimmings. Practically all of us order different items. All of them are great. Love the service. Always refilling our bowls of chips and salsa. And we're a waitress nightmare asking extra cheese, no beans, not regular lettuce salad, but shredded lettuce. Service is awesome. Always full. Best time to go is around 3-5pm."}
{"text":"I don't often get good mexican food anymore now that I live in Canada - so every time I'm in Vegas, I always head for Macayo's.  On my first visit last week I ordered my all-time favourite, a Chili Relleno. It wasn't as tasty as the one I had last year, and now rice and beans are an extra cost. I don't know what was different, other than it just wasn't as good as usual. the Relleno sauce seemed different, and I couldn't taste the chili as much as I should.  On my second visit during the same trip, I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. It was heaven! The chimi was huge, the beef was very flavourful, beans were perfect, it was heaven!  Next trip to Vegas will mean another couple trips to Macayo's for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm a Las Vegas native and Macayo's has been here since I can remember. As teens, we would gather together and eat chips and salsa, drink cherry 7-ups, and tank down on TCT's. Occasionally, someone would spring for a salad and we would all share in the joy. To this day, it's the only place I want to spend my Birthday. I've read where the food is average - not in my opinion. I would certainly give it a 4 out of 5 rating. The smooth salsa is my favorite and I could quite possibly drink it through a straw. The other salsa is just a little above average. It reminds me of what new mown grass smells like. It's funny how we have our favorites and others think they are just average.   As a private chef for many years, I STILL return to Macayo's for my comfort foods. If you want the above average experience at a down home place off the Las Vegas Strip, give them a try. The people are friendly, the service is decent and the prices are right! Go for it! You know you want to!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good.  Staff could use some work.  Try the jalapeno cream sauce."}
{"text":"I have been going to Macayo's since I was doing flip flops in my mom's womb... I only go to this location because my staple location, W Charleston, closed down.  I only eat in the bar... It is a different kind of atmosphere...it's quiet and i love watching the sports... i usually go for happy hour... 3:30-6:30... get the Spinach con Queso dip... always hot and good... i am so obsessed with their smooth chip sauce... it's AMAZING... I love their Albondigas... it's not greasy and always has a lot of flavor... The drinks are good and the service in the bar is always great... they recognize us and are always friendly... if you are looking for an Authentic Mexican Restaurant ...yeah...i wouldn't suggest it... but it has rang my bell for the last 30 years and I will always be a loyal customer!"}

{"text":"No where near to bonito mochican. no authentic mexican taste at all. its bunch of white people trying to make mexican food in their ways..."}
{"text":"SALSA!  I grew up on Macayo's. My dad was a busboy there when he was a mere 15 years old in Old Vegas. I swear I wouldn't be as tall as I am today without the influence of the TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) and the bean and cheese burrito. I still haven't found an albondigas soup that even comes close to Macayo's. Plus there is nothing like their unlimited smooth salsa with tortilla chips that come at the beginning of every meal. Heck it's so good they sell the bottled salsa at your local grocery store.   In my adult age, I have learned to enjoy a new aspect of Macayo's: the MARGARITAS. My favorite thing now is to bring my Cha-Cha margarita glass to the bar and have it refilled for $3.99 a glass. Cha-Cha is a ceramic glass in the shape of a Mexican woman and her hat serves as the receptacle for the healthy margarita refills. She originally cost $10.99 with a margarita.   The service nowadays is a toss up. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not. They have a pretty good happy hour with discount beers and margaritas if you don't want to go the Cha-Cha route. You have to sit in the bar to take advantage of the half off appetizers. The Shredded Beef Burro Enchilada Style is beyond amazing. This may not be super authentico Mexican food but it knows the way to my heart."}
{"text":"I came here once and knew I would never return.  It wasn't that the food was bad.  They had no hot sauce other than Tabasco.  CAn you imagine a Tex/Mex restaurant without Cholula or Tapatio?   I sent a comment to the company via their website and I never got an answer.  With so many Tex/Mex choices available, I'll be glad to drive by this place and keep on going!"}
{"text":"This is Mexican food done American to the max!! Lol if I want cheese all over my wanna be Mexican food I'll come back here but other than that Macayos you can stay away with your sad open faced so called quesadilla!! Smh"}
{"text":"Had not been here in years and it looks as though I have not missed a darn thing! The ONLY bright spot was the warm crispy chips and their Macayo sauce (plus the friendly observant guy who kept the shiny silver chip bowl full!)   Ordered the mini-mex sampler...Seriously, the Don Jose's frozen mini-chimi's and taquito's have far better flavor! It wasn't like the food was awful-it was bland... Not even worth the chewing...   My husband ordered the salmon that came with a chili verde enchilada. He said the seasoning on the salmon was good but the poor salmon was as dry as my contacts after being worn 4-days in a row. The bite of enchilada was fine-nothing exciting but didn't make me sick either.   The servers were pleasant.   Definitely won't be eating here again given the other good eateries in town and the fact that I can buy Don Jose's at Smith's or Albertson's for far less dinero!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I went to lunch it took them 10 minutes to get our drinks ordered, 15 minutes to get a refill, 45 minutes to get our food, and they got my order wrong. So we left I was pretty upset about my experience eating here."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican food. Good location near the T&M if you're going to a game. Fair prices. Tasty chips & salsa. Mediocre service. The TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) was a staple in my childhood at the Phoenix Macayo's, and still holds a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, margarita was good. We were seated near the front door where we could overhear a hostess talking about fly fishing and gutting fish, as well as her half a cigarette she left outside and wouldn't stop talking about.  Just okay experience. Eh."}
{"text":"Macayo's is a restaurant that I have been to many times throughout my entire childhood. When seated you are met with chips, along with a mild and hot salsa. This location is great as it is close the the UNLV campus. The down side is the service is slow, and never ever friendly. It seems as though ever time I have been to this location I am lucky to get a water refill, and I am never greeted with a smile during anytime of my meal. It seems as though I am always \"bothering\" the server.   This visit I got the fish tacos, with a chipotle sauce. The lunch portion is great, giving you two tacos for less than $11. I do not eat the beans or anything else, so I am not a fair judge there. Other than the food, this particular location as become known to me for their bad service.  If you are looking for a typical Mexican restaurant, and are prepared to wait patiently for refills and service, this is a great place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"When I'm every looking for great Latin food I just step right in at macayo's. I typically get the enchiladas and no matter what style they are always fast with the order and delicious. I go here on average twice a month. Don't forget to get some horchata when u go."}
{"text":"Oh I want to rate this one higher than I think it deserves so badly!  Having been in Las Vegas since I was a wee little one, Macayo's was a household name.  We used to get their chips and salsa as a special treat and bring the chips home in s poet bag and the smooth salsa in a styrofoam coffee cup!  I still enjoy to this day their chips and salsa. The TCT is always a great appetizer as well. However, I'm saddened to say that overall, their food sucks.  I have tried a large portion of things on the menu at one time or another and 90% of it is nothing special at all.  This is a terrible reality for me as I want to say it's great.  After being served what looked like a bowl of vomit today aka Chicken Chiliorio, I had to write the review.  This sounded so tasty on the menu but comes out so awful looking and tasting I had to end lunch without eating it.  Fortunately, the great service which is typical of Macayo's staff took it off the check.    Good things:  chips and salsa & TCT Mediocre at best:  everything else I have tried.   I wish I could find a better place that hit the spot on both the chips and salsa and the main course. Those are hard to find a good balance of.    Three stars if you're selective on what you eat"}
{"text":"This place just plain smells....and not of things that make you want to enjoy your meal... eww just thinking about it makes me gag."}
{"text":"Not like I use to remember this place. Service was horrible and the waitress only came to our table 1 time and that was at the end to give us boxes and our check then we got a refil on our drinks right before we were leaving. The food definitely has gone down hill and I was let down by this.  It is really hard to find a good Mexican restaurant and this place was not on that list."}
{"text":"Great Americanized Mexican food. The food is always yummy and quite tasty.   This particular location is one of my favorites in town. The area is nice and the restaurant itself is so big and spacious. No cramping in or having to squeeze into the tables/booths. Yeah for no claustrophobia seating like some of their other older locations.   I really enjoy the food here. No, it's not what my Mexican family makes, but it is good for what it is. I am addicted to their Baja sauce. You could put it on shoe leather and I would eat it up and ask for more! Do yourself a favor and try the Baja enchiladas with extra Baja loveliness.   As well as the Baja sauce, their smooth salsa is delightful. I have been known to pour it all over whatever I am eating for an extra level of yum. It also goes wonderfully with the Baja sauce. I live me some saucy goodness!!!  If you aren't in the mood for a big meal, check out the mini chimichangas. Add cheese on top and you have a great snack. Throw in a margarita and you have a party in your mouth!  The prices are really quite reasonable too. They have great weekday lunch specials, as well as happy hour specials. Also check your neighborhood newspaper and they put coupons in pretty regularly."}
{"text":"The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. The salsa tasted like spicy tomato soup, the tortillas were hard, but I had a veggie fajita and they brought out beef, I am vegan so had to ask for just veggies but when the veggies came out they were good lots of variety, broccoli, squash, zucchini, and mushrooms."}
{"text":"The food was excellent tonight. I got a craving for a good shredded beef burrito and was not disappointed. Tried the Baja Burrito. Shredded beef, Baja cream cheese sauce and lots of cheese. Jose was our server and he kept our drinks full and was a pleasure to be served by. Thank you."}
{"text":"Horrible happy hour and service. Drinks are weak ! Food is bland!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 3 adults and one child (9 yrs).  We enjoyed everything.  The service was satisfactory, the food was good and portions were good for the price paid.  We all took some home for another day.  The salsa was very good as was the guacamole..  I had the steak Cortez and was completely happy.  I would be happy to return for another meal."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for dinner with our friend who lives near by. The place was fairly busy but were seated without a wait. Of course the first thing we ordered was the TCT Mexican pizza, essentially a huge tortilla crispy and covered with melted cheese. This was sent back, was lacking cheese. We also ordered the Trio Dip, this was good. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with Green Enchiladas. The Enchilada was tasty, the Salmon was a dry, over cooked wooden like slab of nasty. Wifey ordered the Carnitas Enchiladas and she reported hers were very good. The service was a bit hit an miss, and overall the place came over as a tourist trap. I would be hard pressed to return here or recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! Great Mexican Food! I went to Macayo's for the 1st time yesterday and was surprised at how much yummy food I got for the price. Will go there again....very soon! :)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the Baja enchiladas and a fried ice cream definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what all the fantastical chatty chat is all about. It's ok Mexican food, I've been there three times & have yet to have an orgasmic south of the border experience.  They do fork over the chips & salsa which is a plus, but the salsa is a lil on the ratty side in my personal opinion.  Maybe being from California I'm spoiled with fabuloso pintos?  I most likely won't be going back, I'll just wait until I go to CA."}
{"text":"My fiancé brought me here . He said it was the best Mexican food in town!! Yeah right. Not at all. Its too Americanized. Avoid this place If you want to have real Mexican Food. The sauces are not even spicy!! I probably will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Macayo's has been a family favorite for decades. This location never fails to provide great service and delicious entrees.   Today my friend and I met for lunch and a few cocktails. The Cadillac Margarita was delicious with a side shot of patron.   Pre lunch was chips and two different salsas. I love the smooth sauce.   We each ordered the 2 combination plates. I love the Baja spinach enchilada and beef tamale with red sauce it also comes with a side of rice and beans.  It arrived hot and tasty.  Linda our server was attentive and made small talk. She was very delightful."}
{"text":"Wow, what a differance in locations. Notice the Charleston location has a 4 star rating with the exact same food. I have to agree. I went there twice, so I just didn't land on a bad day. They were disorganized, unfriendly, too feww waiters serving too many people. It was slow service. A take out order was also overcharged on side items, I'm sure of it. Was in a hurry & couldn't persue it. It's the closest one to my house & I'm willing to go out of my way to another one."}
{"text":"I can't stop going to this place . I am hooked . The drinks are perfect and so is the food . I usually get the shrimp enchiladas but have tried others as well. The customer service is excellent and it doesn't take that long for the food to come out . Lately , I've been ordering to go at least once a week"}
{"text":"I'm here to talk dessert ...The Mini Chimi...was good! They have these little rolls stuffed with chocolate sauce. The rolls are a little harder than crepes. They sit on top of whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. It is served in like a tostada shell..I tried to dip the shell in ice cream but it tasted kind of awkward. They should maybe serve it in a waffle bowl instead. Overall it was a nice treat and it's big enough to share!"}
{"text":"I called and placed a to go order. I ordered 4 meals out of the 4 meals three were wrong. After I repeated the order 3 times when I placed it and the woman on the line read it back to me. When they brought the food out they checked the order by reading it back to us while looking in the bag. Off we went to go home and enjoy our meal. Once we got home we realized 75% of the order was wrong. Called the manager and all she would do is replace the wrong orders. Oh did I mention we tipped them $10.00 for a to go order. Also had to return to pick up our correct order an hour later then expected we finally got to eat. Service here sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Seated us quick, chips & salsa quick, drinks quick,waitress ton or order and food came out in a timely manner. Quality of food was ok.  Wish the flavor was better. $$"}
{"text":"I am quite snarky when it comes to considering Mexican food outside of my home state of Texas.  My coworker is obsessed with Macayo's, mainly because she is a Vegas native and grew up eating here.  She is really fond of it.  The restaurant itself is very large, and boasts a UNLV discount but it does not apply to any of the specials and we only go at lunch so I am not sure if it really works.  It is located right next to Metro Pizza off Tropicana just east of Maryland so it is easy to get to from campus.  All celebrations surrounding her happen here, so I have eaten here more than I expected to ever.  There are plenty of reasonably priced, filling lunch specials - a whole large menu page of them - but I always stick with the combinations.  There is a choice of one or two items for $8.59 or $9.59 and it comes with rice and beans or double of whatever one (I get double rice), plus a small shredded lettuce and diced tomato garnish.  The choices include chile rellenos, enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and probably a few other options.    I typically stick with the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale covered in spicy tomatillo sauce which is quite wonderful.  These items are covered in cheese so if you are not big on cheese, let them know.  I am never wowed by the meal but it is a good average Mexican meal if you are craving one.  I can justify anything covered in green sauce and I can assure you can find something on the menu to satisfy you here.  Service is hit or miss.  Today lunch was smooth and very fast.  Complimentary chips and 2 salsas are included.  Remember, guac makes everything better but costs extra!"}
{"text":"I love their Sonoran Beach tacos and their chips and salsa. But pay with cash when you go there. We had our credit card number stolen last time we went there. So we pay with cash now whenever we go. They have really good Shirley Temple's and our waiter was great about keeping them filled. I love their desserts. Been going to Macayo's since I was a kid, still as good now as it was back then!"}
{"text":"I haven't  had Macayo's  in such along time. I was kinda worried that it wouldn't be the same, but it was, I loved it!! The food was so good, the cocktails was everything!!! Our server Heather was awesome she helped us pick the best dishes on the menu. It was nice and clean, I'm proud to say that Macayo's is just as good now as it was back then:)!!!"}
{"text":"This location is definitely nicer than the others but for some reason it just doesn't have that ghetto flare that the others do... I miss the one on Charleston and Decatur. The service is always OK, I always see more servers and bussers than necessary, or maybe not enough because I can never seem to get my drink, or my chips and salsa refilled in a timely manner. The food has always been pretty good, nothing super authentic but it's a sitdown mexican restaurant where you can be served in a nicer setting. When it comes to price, you have to know what you're looking for, some of the dishes are super over-priced with small portions and some are well-priced with great portions, I honestly have been kind of lost when it comes to some of their dishes and their differences other than price..."}
{"text":"We used to love Macayo's when we lived in Phoenix (disclaimer: this was ten years ago). We went so often, we even bought the souvenir margarita glasses to bring with us each time we went. After today, I will probably never return. It was just not good. Queso tasted like pure melted velveeta. Flavorless, tough fajitas, with all onion and no pepper. Beans had an off flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on, and refuse to take another bite in order to identify it. Husband liked the chicken enchilada with Baja sauce, but not enough to come back. Daughter found hair in her lettuce garnish. Wish I'd ordered a marg to drown the foul experience in tequila. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Walked in and for greeted ,   Sat down and got our drink orders , got chips and salsa. Salsa was watery , nothing special . I've been to many Mexican restaurants and their salsa's weren't watery as this .   Server said he was gonna be with us in a few minutes , showed up 10 minutes later. I was already full off my whole cup of soda. Nice atmosphere, but employees need to SMILE more. Every employee in here looks very tired .    I work in a restaurant and we're all about customer service , here isn't . When I asked for a refill , I got a \"yup\" uhh it's of course , or sure, or yes. Not yup ! Please work on smiling , and talking to the customer . She that you guys appreciate us!    Moving on to our food ....     Ordered the Mexican potato skin and the Baja pizza .   Baja pizza .... AMAZING but needs more chicken piece , each slice had 2-3 small pizza everything was drenched in cheese and Baja sauce. 10/10  Potato skins.... Meeeh ! Not so great , we asked for beef not chicken . 3/10  All in all I'll be back for the Baja pizza nothing else ."}
{"text":"I arrived last night and walked in. I stood next to the cashier for almost 10 minutes while not ever being acknowledged or greeted. Multiple people walked by before somebody finally stopped to ask if we had been helped as well.  After finally being sat it seemed like it took forever to have our oder taken. Our drinks came, and it was a good thing everybody had ordered water as we had to get up and grab a pitcher ourself to get a refill. Pretty frustrating again.  I will agree with a few others as well on the food. It is pretty bland for what is supposed to be \"authentic mexican\" food. I was really hoping that things had changed here, but it is still just same ol boring place with ok service....sometimes. for a place with so much potential,  it just fails to deliver."}
{"text":"The food is okay here but the service is very good. The last time I went, we ordered the steak fajitas and they were cooked differently than before. Instead of having a char broiled appearance coming from the sizzling plate, it was watery and looked like it was boiled. We sent the food back and when they re-did it, it looked the same. When they realized that we were still unhappy with the food, they gave us a free dessert. It was fried ice cream but the fried parts which looked like cereal was stale and not crunchy. It was hard to chew. It could have been an off night but I have had better Mexican food elsewhere. I have to give them credit for their effort to make it right but I was dissatisfied with the food."}
{"text":"Completely in love with the happy hour menu that you can enjoy EVERYDAY of the week! We love the bar area, always playing the best games and the bartender Manuel is always welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over 40 years, since I was a little kid. Moved to El PAso where Mexican food is everywhere, I still like Macayos the best!!"}
{"text":"Probably 2.5 stars.  The staff was nice but it's the food that holds this place back from  a higher rating.  The chips and salsa are bland.  Went with the chicken, shrimp and steak fajitas.  The steak was clearly a low quality and tasted like liver, everything else just felt massed produced.  Next will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was really affordable and cheap and you get unlimited chips and salsa. I love the fact that I felt like everything was very affordable.  The service was a little slower and the quality of food wasn't very high.  I am glad the the position size for my fajita was huge! But the steak had little flavor, the salsa probably came from a a can, and the overall seasoning was bland.   We will come back however because I love affordable Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went there today. Had a carne asada burrito. It was the WORST carne asada burrito I have ever eaten in my life. Very bland. Not enough meat. Watery even.  Just plain gross. Gonna go back to Robertos."}
{"text":"This place is super popular. They are of the \"extremely generous portions\" school of Mexican food.  Now, I'm a vegetarian, so I have to rely on what my dining partners say about their food, but I LOVE mexican food, so my friend has dragged me here twice.  My friend cannot handle spice. Seriously, once I put pepper jack in a sandwich and she almost died from heartburn or something. But she LOVES Macayos, probably for the same reason I don't like it too much - I find it bland. Enormous, and cheap ($10 gets you food to last for three meals), but bland. Although I like the salsa and free chips. My other friend liked her taco salad, because she was in a mood for crispy shells. I've had the veggie burrito with sauce (Oh, they don't tell you, but the sauce is $1 extra), the cheese enchiladas (the sides are refried beans, which aren't my fave, but the sauce wasn't very spicy or onion-y), and the veggie fajitas (not bad).  I'd come here again, but only because my best friend loves the place."}
{"text":"WOW.  excellent service and food.  our waitress was on the ball, even on a busy Saturday night.  we got more free chips/salsa without hesitation.  food was above average mexican, but good portioned.  easy to locate just off west sahara...big ol' building.  we would be back...and very much enjoyed our experience.  hubby ordered some big combo plate -- and he ate it up pretty fast.  i got a veggie quesadilla, yum!"}
{"text":"I do love the chips and salsa, but most if the food is from a can.  This location got an extra star cause its always clean.  Service is spotty, unless you ask for Hugo, he's awesome!  Sometimes reminding the bussers to refill the water and chips gets old, but a full bar makes up for it.  The Shrimp Chilorio is tasty and good, and the Green Chili Cheese Enchiladas are unique.  They offer businesses 15% discount cards, do ask!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here n i was on a date. I'd have given a five star review but the lady who helped us was really snippy n sarcastic, which made my date get irritated n say  some mean things the whole night. Other than that my chimichanga was really good. I could have done without the waitress n the bad company. They should have eaten together."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife, daughter, son-in-law, and three young grandchildren. This place is excellent for family dining. It was early-dinner time, we had no reservation, and they sat us right away. I heard other children in there, but there was a half wall between us and them, so it wasn't a problem. We ordered five main courses and a few side orders (guacamole, rice and beans, etc.), and they had no problem with us sharing the food. In other words, they didn't charge us for sharing. Always a plus. My son-in-law is kosher, and he enjoyed every dish for which he could eat. The kids really liked it, which is what it's all about, right? The decor was as authentic as any other Mexican restaurant that I've been to, and when my family visits again, I'm sure that we'll be going back there. Yay!"}
{"text":"The reason I give this a 3 star review is because of service. Not from our waitress but the support staff. First the support staff is terrible. We waited over 20 min for a refill on drinks and the check. For this reason your waitress tonight on left room(sorry I don't have her name but she was the only one) gets slammed by her to hostess sitting at front talking. Then second reason you give her a bus boy that should be filling waters, clearing dishes, ect this poor lady is running her A.. Off and then customers get mad at her. I know how it is and this is a management problem. Bus boys do more than bring chips. He could have rinsed our cups, brought a to go box, filled our waters. So she can do her job. Ownership needs to take action. This is 3 stars overall for a reason. Food is only average. Bring your place back to action. We be sad to see this location go too."}
{"text":"Not very authentic Mexican food but very good. Baja sauce is unique and tasty!  They were very accommodating to my gluten free food needs"}
{"text":"I been to here a few times when visiting family ...I recently moved out here and been craving some Mexican food...I came by a few days ago and ordered..... My order came out as I expected...... 2 crispy beef tacos rice and beans yummy.....my wife order on the other hand was not that good.....she ordered a carne asada burrito.....first of all our server was nice my wife asked what came in the burrito....server said carne asada cheese & pico de gallo ...... Her burrito arrives and there lettuce in the burrito.....BTW who servers a burrito without rice n beans in it......it tasted like a wrapped cheeseburger.... Even the kids chicken taquitos were not that great.... Prices are a bit to high but depending on what you order food not that great...."}
{"text":"We eat there when ever were in town, it was our place to meet up with family when we lived there. Great food and great salsa! They're very consistent with there dishes and great wait staff."}
{"text":"This review regards a takeout order. After placing the order at 1:45 pm, I finally received the order at 2:20. Originally, the girl who took the order said it would take 15 minutes. While I overlooked the delay, I cannot overlook the awful customer service. Melissa H., the so called \"supervisor,\" was completely unreasonable and has no business in her current position. A simple incorrect order turned into nightmare. When I asked for the take out person to correct the order, I was blamed for the mistake and met with rolling eyes. When I requested better customer service, Melissa continued to blame me. I'm absolutely shocked that she has any authority at a Vegas classic like Macayos. I have frequented this location for over 20 years and consistently bring friends and family here. However, those days may be behind me if the service fails to improve. Melissa stated that I hurt her ability to train a new employee, but rather than viewing the situation as harmful, she should have viewed it as a learning opportunity. Melissa acted like a scorned teenager, rather than an employee delivering customer service. Get it together, Macayos."}
{"text":"It says a lot about a place when the best part of your meal was the chips and salsa. The service was very attentive, especially considering the huge party of sixteen she had to attend to (that being us).  The food, on the other hand, is comparable to a fast food chain. I split a plate of tacos with a friend. The chicken tacos, soft shell, were decent. Literally, I could have gone down the street, and gotten them for cheaper. The rice and beans were sub-standard - nothing special. Other than the chips and salsa, the TCT was another shining point. A huge quesadilla, pizza-esque creation. It was pretty delicious. Authentic on the other hand? Not so much.  In telling my brother's friends where I was headed off to for dinner, they all had the same response: \"Macayo's? Oh...\". I now understand. It's pretty much a glorified Taco Bell with a cult following."}
{"text":"I've been going to Macayo's for probably 30 years. I love it. The TCT is extra yummy. I usually get either the shredded beef burrito enchilada style or chicken fingers, both delicious. I also used to get the gringo cheeseburger which was always good as well. My husband loves the Sonoran Wings spicy."}
{"text":"Had been to Macayo's in the Phoenix area countless time, but today on our Dive bar tour . . . we decided to stop in for lunch . . . One BIG Mistake.  The service was terrible . . . the server took our drink order . . . and THREE bowls of chips and salsa later . . . she was back with the drinks and took our order.  Another two bowls of chips later . . . the food arrived.  Problem was . . . it was COLD and GREASY.  Saving grace was that we ate enough chips to fill up . . . we definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Macayo's is serving up the most white-washed Mexican food I've ever tasted. Bleh. The food was entirely bland and lacked any distinguishing flavors. Let it be known that it was not my choice to eat here in the first place. (I blame you, husband, for feeding me mediocre food!). ;-)  CHIPS & SALSA: Chips were average but goodness gracious, that watered down salsa is the worst (to include store-bought) I've ever had. Zero flavor. It's basically red water. 1/5  CALIFORNIA BURRITO ($10.49): Way too much sour cream and forgettable in every way. Presentation was very boring as well. 1/5  BAJA BURRITO ($10.99): My husband said his \"wasn't that bad\" but agreed we would not be coming back. 3/5  SERVICE: Our waiter was the one bright spot on our visit. He kept up on refills and cleared up plates quick like. He also got our check ASAP when asked. Food was out in a jiffy and we were seated right when we walked in. 4/5  ATMOSPHERE: Kind of sad and nothing special. Decor is drab and the layout is weird. They tried to seat us in this domed auditorium area with A/C fans blasting on us at first. Nope, not happening. We moved to a different section and were much happier. 2/5  Return Visit? Yeah, um no. Macayo's needs to make REAL salsa and step up the flavor in their dishes!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #33"}
{"text":"Very good food, went at 130 pm Service very slow, waiter forgot items, then took extensive time to bring to table"}
{"text":"Why are there soooo many people hating on Macayos? The food is awesome. The service sucks! But...  Macayos is a Vegas staple. There prices are reasonable. It's not the most authentic place, but it does it's job. I've never had a BAD meal here.  I recommend: tortilla soup, baja burrito - shredded beef, pollo con espinaca,  enchiladas (any will work here), fried ice cream, and their signature margaritas!  If you want tasty Mexican delights at decent prices and are in no big hurry, this is the spot. Word. Ole!"}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes to be greeted by a server I thought I would suck it up and be patient. However, it got worse! The soup we ordered had a layer of grease on the top and the margaritas were watered down with cheap sour mix. Furthermore, the food came out at different times leaving the kids without their cold quesadillas. The server was far from apologetic and I was sorry we came. I always look for a positive though-the salsa was delicious. However, it is safe to say I think I will stick to my other favorite Mexican spots next time."}
{"text":"Probably the worst macayo's in town the food was terrible"}
{"text":"When you visit Macayo's Mexican restaurant you need to understand it's about The Toasted Cheese Tortilla (TCT)  they have been serving them up for the forty years, if not longer!  If want a place where food is bland and has great soup and the world best TCT then Go to Macayo's if you want heat go to one of the other 1,260 Mexican joints in the valley!"}
{"text":"Horrible service for Happy Hour! I met some friends here for happy hour last Friday (not my idea) and was sadly disappointed. The happy hour specials are reduced priced drinks and half off appetizers. Our problem was that we had a 90 year old waiter that had huge difficulties taking orders and getting them right. We ordered drinks that took forever to receive even though we were sitting 5 feet away from the bar. I walked up to the bartender (at the bar) at one point to order another drink and was quickly told that I had to wait for the old man to come back. The appetizers we ordered came out in sporadic order, some never came at all so we had to reorder. He even brought us a few we didn't order. I saw another table haggling with the waiter about the check he received as well. They need to either hire an additional waiter for the bar area during happy hour, or find one that can multitask efficiently. We had a group of 10 people and it took us 3 hours to get 10 drinks and 5 appetizers.   On a side note, the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We've eaten our fair share of Mexican food here in Las Vegas, and this was one of the first places we tried.  It's consistently good, and not very expensive.  This was the first time for this location, and on a Sunday afternoon, not very busy.    We ordered the green chili bites as an app and they were so good.  I got the baja burrito which I love because of the sauce.  I could eat that on just about anything.    The food was fresh, hot, spiced just right and the service was swift, definitely a return visit is in order."}
{"text":"This is one of the first Mexican places we tried right after moving to Vegas years ago. There where many different locations but this Sahara one was the one we'd visit the most.   One of the reasons for coming back is their Baja sauce, love it on everything. I usually get the Baja chimi. You have your choice of meat, I usually get shredded. Always tender and has good flavor. It's rolled up in a flour tortilla, then fried, and smothered in their chili relleno sauce and finally topped with Baja sauce. I also get sour cream and guacamole to top it off.   Usually the thing is a bit soggy by the time it reaches the table with only the ends still a bit crisp. But I really don't mind, I come for the Baja sauce!    You can get it alone, with rice or beans or both, or as my husband's choice with fries! The end less bowl of chips and two red salsa, one chunky and one a bit smoky. To top it off, they have sopapillas with butter and honey!   I thought service was attentive, prices are fair, flavor of food was worthy of another visit. Is it the best tasting food in this category, no but you can't beat the Baja sauce!"}
{"text":"Never had bad service here. Never had a bad meal here. Baja burritos are the sh*t. Carne asada and carnitas are always cooked to order here."}
{"text":"Bottomless chips and salsa, amazing margaritas, and amazing food! If I am craving Mexican food this is my go to place and I have never been disappointed. I am super picky and they always make my order just the way I asked. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"The service was nice but the food was simply inedible. Don't do it. If you want cheap and tasty the go to Los Tacos on Sahara. If you want the best and price is not an issue the go to Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn. They are the only authentic 5 star Mexican in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been to Macayo's before and gave it a bad review which You can see in my profile but this time was the complete opposite. I was a little thrown off by the crazy shirts the staff wear but the place was packed and that is normally a great sign. We went with a few friends and we were seated relatively quick.   Now to the reason that a star was lost. Our waitress came around the corner wearing her party animal shirt like everyone else which you would think would put you in an amazing mood, but instead she came around the corner like a communist leader demanding our order and being super impatient and not at all welcoming.. Once we gave Mrs. Marx our order she disappeared and did not come back until the food was ready.   (Pow, One star Gone)  The Saving Grace here was the quality of the chicken Chimichanga that was brought to the table, first of all it was the size of a small baby and second it was probably one of the best chimichangas I have ever had. To me it says something when the food you serve can overpower the horrid service that your servers provide.   I think we will go back from time to time I am just hoping that we dont get Cruella the waitress again."}
{"text":"I was torn between a 2 and a 3.  A  2 doesn't mean I'll never come back, but it does mean the food is not the quality I prefer from a sit-down Mexican restaurant.  This is one of those casual eateries where the food is slightly better than a fast-food joint but not totally unpleasant. The chips were very pedestrian. The salsas could have been made from canned tomatoes.  If a friend wanted to stop here I'd be ok with it, but if I wanted a nice evening out, this wouldn't be the place.  Other than the food, the ambience was casual and comfortable, everything was clean, and the waitstaff were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Such a Vegas staple! Chips & smooth salsa, Shirley Temple, TCT & fried ice cream! Macayo's is our go-to for celebratory meals! Ask for $ Hugo's section - he is a little heavy handed in serving, but he is super funny and awesomely polite! We've literally tried everything on the menu. The kids love the nachos with shredded beef and sour cream. Hubby switches between fajitas and chinichangas. My TCT is always perfect with smooth salsa and maybe a smidge of guac! The lunch menu is decent. The margaritas are awesome! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Lunch for 2 costs $36 here not including tip.    The place is corporate mexican restaurant...  - The servers were okay but you can tell they hate their job. - The table was all gummed and sticky. - The place is \"stale\" - hard to explain - but that is the best description I can come up with. - I had 2 chicken enchiladas.  Meh..  Rice and beans. meh...  I would say this is below average mexican food.  I would skip this place.  No Bueno."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Macayo's locations for over 30 years. Tonight's experience was the typical experience you would expect at this restaurant. It wasn't amazing but not bad either l. The food came out fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I want to love Macayo's. At one time, I did. The service was below average, I think that the waiter was over loaded which I blame on the business, not him. The Chips were excellent, the guacamole was just average. The rest of the food was mediocre at best. i cannot, in good conscience recommend Macayo's anymore. There are much better choices for sit down mexican food in town."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at its finest! I love their burritos and quesadillas. I came here a lot during my pregnancy because I was always craving it! If you're looking for a tasty burrito in Las Vegas, go to macayos. You wont be diappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst experience  ever with the supervisor. She has no supervisory skills.  We order food and there was a confusion with the order. My wife ordered 1 taco and the  waiter (kyle) brought 4. He explained to us that it would be fine and not to worry. He said he wouldn't charge us for the extra tacos.  Once we where done eating we ask for a to go box to put our food away.  The waiter then informs us that we could not  have to extra food. So we inform him that we would gladly pay for it since I had already put my food in same container. It wasn't our mistake but we were fine with paying for the extra food. He said it's fine he would fix it. When we went to pay for the food the supervisor informed us that she had removed the charge for the extra food. When we finished paying for meal my wife was  picking up the food container at which point the supervisor snatches the food out of my wife's hand with out saying a word. We assume it was ok to take it since the waiter continued to say it was ok to take it.  We were in shock and just walk out. She took the extra tacos and half of my food that I had paid that was in the same container. We have notified  office and hopefully something is done about that rude supervisor.   None of this was our fault. We were given the wrong food. We were told it would be free since the waiter made the  mistake. Then we were  treated like we were trying to steal food. We understood there was a confusion. What we are mad about was how that supervisor just snatched the food out of my wife's hand like if we were trying to steal it."}
{"text":"Had my 40th Birthday dinner here and it was very good. I've been eating at Macayo's since I was in a high chair and it still taste the same. Good service, everyone's food was as order and hot. The best house margarita . They have great singing voices too. Can't wait until my next TCT."}
{"text":"Been coming here my whole life, we have brought in birthdays, anniversaries and more. I love the chips and salsa and usually the service is always good. I love the enchiladas, shredded beef and green sauce. I have also had a steak there and it had cheesy goodness on top...bomb.  They have a good happy hour as well:)"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Macayos here in town for over 30 years. I have been coming since I was little and have noticed it has remained consistent. Their chips and salsa are not what most places would call \"traditional\" salsa, but it is good. I only come here occasionally now if I am looking for a quick and cheap meal. Their TCTs are simple and tasty without being greasy. In the bar area they have happy hour which is half price all appetizers , including TCTs, which are a great price."}
{"text":"Very poor service. I call in to place an order and am advised it will be ready in 10 minutes. I arrive 12 minutes later and of course they want the money. I wait another 15 and call from my cell a lady comes I ask for my money back. The manager comes with the food by this time I just want to leave not with food just my money. I wouldn't recommend it go back."}
{"text":"Never again!   1. bland food, everything taste canned or packaged.   2. expensive for the low quality   3. service is bad   4. miserable decor   Don't waste your money!   Worst Mexican restaurant meal I have had in my lifetime guaranteed!   I suggest \"Super Mex\" see my review! Durango/215."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food! My boyfriend and I stopped in last Saturday, we sat in the bar and our service was GREAT! We ordered margaritas to start, and enjoyed chips and salsa.... I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco, my food was delicious! I would definitely recommend Macayo's.... I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this restaurant, but it was just okay.    i liked our waitress; our food not so much.  the chips were alright.  salsa tasted store-bought or like it came out of the can.  i mostly got full off of that because the food took a while.  ordered a three choice meal. i chose a deep fried shredded beef taco, sour cream green chicken enchilada, and tamale with a chicken tortilla soup on the side.  the best of my choices was the sour cream green chicken enchilada.  everything else was meh. the food is more americanized and it's acceptable for that matter, but disappointing for me as i was expecting authentic.    i probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"NIce settling, very colorful.  Food was excellent.  Went for lunch with my grandmother.  Guac was really really good.  And i am picky.  Had the enchiladas del mar.  Pieces of crab and shrimp very tasty."}
{"text":"Don't come Macayo's expecting great food or even good food. I have only tried their happy hour which is until 6:30 on weekdays. On the few occasions I have come it has been with regulars and the service is always impeccable. The staff is very sweet and accommodating and they seem to know all the regulars by name.   The food is lacking in pretty much every ways but if you stick to the happy hour menu and keep your expectations low, you'll have a great time. Margaritas are cheap and tasty and I've always had a good time when I'm there, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"I remember it being a lot better than it is now.  Not as good as it use to be. Service was ok. Probably won't be coming back."}
