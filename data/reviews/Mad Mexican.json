{"text":"Came for dinner on a Monday. The good: location, atmosphere The bad: the food was awful, it was all lukewarm. 3 for 12 tiny, bland, cold tacos. Lukewarm queso fondido.  The mediocre: the drinks were okay, although my first one was replaced due to a piece of hairy fibre in it...I was still charged. I would never come back here, I would never recommend."}
{"text":"I rate this place two stars simply for the overall decor and ambiance.   The service was quick and friendly although my cocktail came at least 5-10 minutes after the main course.   The overall food quality is horrible and hardly authentic.   We started with the chunky guac which was nothing special but the tastiest thing I tried.  It was unfortunately served with a plate of broken tortilla chips. At first, I thought this was a mistake until I noticed every other table was served the same thing.   Needless to say, these should have really been discarded.   I ordered the taco trio with shrimp, fish and chicken as my main course.   Flour tacos fell apart upon touch so at that point I'm thinking this should have  really been served with a knife and fork.   The taste was no better.  The shrimp was so fishy it was inedible and the fish and chicken were both bland.   I ordered a mojito on the rocks to drink. It was also disappointing because it wasn't cold enough (not enough ice) though the taste was okay.   This place has amazing potential. A new chef is needed stat; otherwise, I don't see them surviving."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, get the guacamole and chips...the best.   Good service too!"}
{"text":"Extremely reasonably price food with super friendly service and good atmosphere. The food comes quickly and tastes good. It's a solid place - nothing out of the ordinary but good enough to go back again and again. The drinks were slow, that's my only real criticism. I like supporting local places and this has become a go-to for us!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend a couple nights ago, best mexican ive had in a long time."}
{"text":"So good! We ordered one of each taco and all were so juicy. A little small so order extra if you are a big guy like me. Staff and sauce's are sweet and spicy. Fun place for friends!"}
{"text":"We randomly saw this place online and decided to try because it was open and  we were craving tacos.  What a gem!  The bartender got our drinks as soon as we sat down while we went over the menu.  So the best thing about this place is that everything is made in house from the tortillas to the salsas and if not it's comes right from Mexico.  We just go back from two weeks in Mexico and we have say the tacos and salsa tasted like it came from there. Super authentic.  We love the carnitas tacos but all the tacos were excellent. It is very meaty without any of the filler stuff.  If we order three taco (you can mix the different tacos cause of a lot places don't let you do that), it's $12. You can feel full from 3 tacos.  Also the margaritas' was very authentic for only $6. We love the spicy rim.  If you love the chips and salsas, you can get it at the front of the restaurant and have it at home.  Larry our waiter was amazing!  You definitely need to try this place.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying what's memorable is the service. Her name started with a \"P\" im sorry i forgot the rest lol. I'm sorry to say but this place definitely lacks when it comes to the food. The tacos are dry and plain, it was definitely missing that WOW factor. Oh when they aren't dry it's because of the oil from the meat which soak through and cause your corn tortila to break. I hope they improve their menu, it is a nice place. The homemade chips are great! But it wont keep me coming back."}
{"text":"lets keep this simple. Juicy delicious tacos, best chips w/ salsa and guacamole. very excellent service;my water was consistantly refilled.  Casual friendly welcoming atmosphere.  service 5/5 food 5/5 atmosphere 5/5 value 4/5   I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed enough with this place to break my vow that I wouldn't do anymore Yelp reviews because so many of mine were negative. Oh well. Here's one more for the mix.  I've been a fan of the Mad Mexican chips and dips for several years: they're both fresh and delicious (if not a little overly salty), and so I had high hopes for their restaurant. I recently tried a few of their tacos (chicken, steak, and shrimp) and each one was bland. So very bland. The complementary sauces spruced them up, but not nearly enough. For what they charge for the tacos, this is really pathetic. Come on folks...it's a taco...it should be simple, perfectly seasoned, and delicious....it's not that difficult. But apparently it is for the Mad Mexican chefs. (New menu due out in May....perhaps it'll be better?)"}
{"text":"This place just isn't good. Maybe people get excited that there are tacos available in their neighbourhood, but this is nothing to get excited about. Ridiculously small portions (like one or two small pieces of protein per taco), flavors bland and muddied and the salsas are sub par. These people are straight up ripping people off. Cashing in on taco fever and hoping you won't notice it's really crap by disguising it as hip and local."}
{"text":"Good service.  Tasty tacos - but they'd be better if they weren't overfilled. It makes it difficult, if not impossible, to put any toppings on them. Maybe give an extra taco shell?  The guacamole was good - but too heavy on the raw white onions for my taste.  Amazing hot sauce! - Bought a bottle to take home.  The Choriqueso - pan fried chorizo in melted cheese with flour tortillas - was ok.  I also tried the shrimp cocktail - which I hated - probably because I was expecting whole shrimp, maybe with a salsa, guacamole, horseradish cocktail sauce. Instead it was chopped up pieces of shrimp in a sour tasting sauce...more like a ceviche. They took it back and didn't charge me though.  Loud atmosphere, which is fine - the chairs were uncomfortable. But hey, maybe that's a strategy to increase turnover - there were lots of people waiting to get a table.  Would definitely not come here in the winter - no inner vestibule? - it's gonna be cold!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are HUGE Mexican food fans and are always trying out new restaurants to see which has the best tacos and other yummy Mexican foods. We were super excited to try this restaurant, as the menu looked really good and prices were pretty decent.  The restaurant itself has a really nice vibe, perfect for all occasions and looks like it could hold a larger party. There is a small bar with a couple of tv's if your looking for a quick bite and a drink. The service is pretty decent, although one of the servers forgot to get us cutlery and an extra plate (I think he was new), and when I told another server, he brought them to us right away.  I got there early and enjoyed a glass of red wine- great wine choices and decent prices. When my friend arrived we both tried there mad mexican martini- so good! Has a great spicy kick to it but goes down smooth- would defiantly get this again! Being a lover of spice, I was excited to try the jalapeno bars, but was extremely disappointment when they arrived. Basically it is 2 jalapenos cut in half, stuffed with cream cheese, served cold- they were horrible, I couldn't even eat them. The guacamole- small portion and I have had way better.  We both decided to get tacos, after all, who doesn't love a good taco! But the presentation of the tacos are poor and looked like they were put together with very little effort. The corn tortilla is dry and falls apart quickly. I tried the shrimp taco, mushroom taco with cheese, as per the servers recommendation, and the slow braised pork. Everything to me was dry and tasteless and luke warm.  I was pretty upset about the meal, as I was looking forward to some good tacos, but perhaps this place isn't the best for a good taco. Maybe the other people at the restaurant knew this, as I noticed that not a single person near me ordered tacos. The family beside me has a steak dinner, another couple had the soup and various other shared plates.  I would come here again just to have the martini, and try some of there other dishes, but never again would I try there tacos.  FYI- I asked the server to recommend any spicy or spicier items on the menu and to my disappointment our sever said that everything on the menu is quite mild in order to please all customers, and they provide a couple of hot sauces should you want to make things spicy. I think I went overboard on the hot sauce just to make my tacos spicy and add flavour!  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d6602124-r413460861-Mad_Mexican_Tacohouse-Toronto_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"Great little spot!! The service and food are amazing here!! The staff go above and beyond to get you what you want and to make you feel comfortable! I will continue to come here in a regular basis. Always a good time"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the branding is excellent. We had the Guacamole, Tortilla soup, the mini burrito and a few tacos. The tortilla chips are made in house and you can purchase it in bags as well (which we did). Take-out is available. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decent food. All the staff were attentive and friendly. Food was decent, if a little pricey. But I guess you have to expect that from a Mexican restaurant a few notches higher in quality than Taco Bell. Nice variety of tacos on the menu. Assortment of hot sauces, from mild to \"call 911\"."}
{"text":"There tacos are fantastic.  It's not like mom used to make as a kid from the yellow box that's for sure.  Gourmet taco's I'd say.  Delicious!  The waitress was really helpful and the 3 different sauces offered for the tacos were fresh and went well with the tacos."}
{"text":"I'd have tolerated the mediocre food (dry steak tacos, decent tortilla soup, soggy chicken tinga..) if it weren't for the incredibly bad customer service. After 2 previous incorrect take-out orders I called to complain to a manager when our tacos were filled with only caramelized onions. The dude answering the phone said their tinga tacos are veg, then got the manager and I could fully hear a long conversation they were having about how he repeated my order back to me, so I got it wrong, what do I want to complain about, it's my problem etc. See ya. Tons of other options in the neighbourhood. Enjoy going out of business in the near future."}
{"text":"Happy this joint opened up in the neighbourhood! Food is very yummy and there's plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Mad Mexican for a while now.... It looks nice and clean, service was okay but the staff was really friendly. I really liked the coffee, it had hints of cinnamon in it, the lemonade was refreshing.... I ordered the tortilla soup which was delicious! It had so many depths of flavour the $7 was okay for it, it was a good size bowl. We ordered 4 tacos a grilled fish, fried shrimp, chicken and steak... I loved the fried shrimp, the grilled fish was ok but the chicken and steak tacos were dry and tasteless.... At $4.50 each they are way over priced.... I would go back for the soup but other than that there is nothing worth a return visit....."}
{"text":"Loved it here.  Great selection and great taste.  It's like being back in Playa del Carmen again."}
{"text":"It is so difficult to find a sit down Mexican place. That is what these guys are. Took my date there. Great food, great service and pricing. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is an okay taco place, but nothing special at all. I ordered tacos and even though the waiter tried really hard to sell us on their toppings, I was not impressed with my meal at all. The meat on the tacos was cold and the toppings did not look fresh. It may have been because I came in on a super slow day, but still it should have been better. It's an ok place but I certainly would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place could be so much better! The idea and presentation of the tacos were great, but quite bland. My son, 5, loved it, likely because it was so bland. My husband, daughter and I were kinda \"meh,\" there was just no flavour (my daughter knows good food!). But the servers were nice, if way too busy. And what mexican restaurant charges for chips + salsa, seriously? I'd like to go back, but probably won't. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went back to the Mad Mexican for our second time as the first time was great. The experience was a little different.  The service was fast as usual but they they got our orders wrong. Some of our tacos were missing cheese that we paid extra for and one dish was wrong all together. They obviously noticed the mistake and took it back but never told us how long it would be and they never bothered to apologize. Waiting for the last dish left our other food cold.  Also when we ordered the dessert, 3 different dishes, each dessert came out about 3 minutes later than the one before which was weird. It definitely made it seem like they couldn't handle a busy night but the restaurant was only half full so I'm really shocked the service was sub-par.  Going a second time also makes you realize how mediocre the food is."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food was Friedas - food and atmosphere.  Too bad none of the atmosphere moved to the new Mad Mexican.  Food sill great, but more suitable to old location south of annette"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere . Free street parking  Food was absolutely delicious ... Maybe the best Mexican food I've ever had . Tacos were delicious and make sure to try their house hot sauce . Nice choice of local beers on tap. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Defiantly will go again ."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful concept, great service, everything was delicious!  I'll be back, soon hopefully."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING! SO DISAPPOINTING! First of all, their website isn't updated and their prices have gone way up. They charge you $4 per taco. PER TEENY TINY TACO.  I had the fish tacos and honestly, they should have been called lettuce tacos. There was very little fish in there to speak of. The chicken fajito seemed a bit more full but again, at $4 a piece, it's a rip off.  The guacamole is good but too heavy on the onion and the avocado they used for our serving tonight seemed like it was over-ripe. It should have been used yesterday. Coming from California and knowing what really excellent Mexican tastes like, all I can say is MEH. There is a real market and desire for solid mexican food in the city-- these guys do not reach the level of excellence. Most of the flavours are good but the serving sizes are so small that we would never return. MEH.  Stop cheaping out Mad Mexican, or your business is going to continue to die down."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  There were only three people in here besides us and it took them a while to serve the food.   My poor wife was so hungry she ate all the tomato.  At least they gave us free chips."}
{"text":"When I learned that Mad Mexican was moving to a larger location just up the street from their original spot I was excited and relieved. The food was fantastic and I went often.  Unfortunately, with the move to a larger spot came a move away from quality and care to mass produced mediocrity.  The food is still good, but not as fantastic as it once was. Let's hope they settle into their new digs quickly and return to what made them a great eatery in the first place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Once for take out (at their old location a block away) and the other time I actually sat down.    I'd definitely recommend sitting down to enjoy your meal if you plan on getting tacos because it just doesn't taste the same by the time you get home.  Overall the food is okay. Really I actually prefer Playa Cabana Cantina's (a few blocks over in the Junction) selection, food and price.  I'm happy to see that they have been doing well but honestly, I don't find Mad Mexican anything extraordinary.  They lost points for flavour, menu selection and price, but kudos for atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, last time was months ago and both times were great. This time I made it for the lunch special. We started with the guac, was nothing special but the chili oil over top gives it a good kick. For mains I got the shrimp taco which was perfectly crispy and the slaw was not to overpowering. I got my favourite from the last time, the carnitas!! It was perfectly salty and fatty. My girlfriend who was vegetarian got the two veggie options, the potato taco was her favourite over the fajitas veggies. Also tried the revolution torta which was amazing! steak and choriza with avocado, onion and mayo on a perfectly cripsy yet soft light bun! I will defo get again!"}
{"text":"After tasting their delicious chips and various salsas/guacamole at my local store. My wife and I finally made our pilgrimage to the restaurant. Excellent ambiance and good service. However the food missed the mark. Not that it was horrendous, but there was simply nothing special about it. In addition, the portions were small for the price paid."}
{"text":"I got there on a Friday night at 8 and the place was packed. Servers bustled about with great activity and smiles. I decided to redirect my intended Dine In experience to Take Out, my order was taken immediately.  Upon my return from a quick dash to the  loo, as I approached the service counter, so did my dinner. All was in perfect order and delicious."}
{"text":"Exceptional salsa.  Fresh taste.  Very clean and natural tasting.  I also have a hard time finding good salsa and don't mind preparing my own - I just don't like the time it takes.  Mad Mexican makes a great Pico de Gallo (hot or mild), Roasted tomatillio and avocado salsa, and morita salsa.    No preservatives, so you have to eat it quick.  Glad to have preservative free food.    I've yet to buy anything from there that I haven't been happy with - and that's not a statement I can normally make."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here four times. We've only had 1/4 bad experiences when a chef in training made our food. We complained and they comped our food and we've been back since. The chicken tacos are our favourite. Fish are also good. Not a fan of the pork or steak, but they're still decent. Happy that they have Boneshaker on tap! I can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Very average... Hardly authentic, you think they would bring some complimentary natchos while you wait..."}
{"text":"Not Tex-mex. Very good Tacos, chicken is a little dry, but flavourful.  The pork was really the best.  Good Guacamole, the chips are a little too salty, but the very good Mojito helped.  Nice atmosphere.  Don't order coffee unless cinnamon is your most favourite flavor ever.  It's loaded.  They also serve the coffee in an enamel cup...really bad idea, hot fingers and lips.  Will go back to try all other menu items."}
{"text":"Fall from grace - used to be one of my favourite Mexican spots but they've raised the prices ($17 for 3 tacos), and lowered the quality (they don't even serve fresh salsas with the tacos anymore). Unfortunately, that was my last visit."}
{"text":"This was one of our favourites but the menu has changed.  The steak my husband used to order is gone and the closest thing is $12 more.   What I order increased in price by about 25% and sides that used to be included are now an extra charge.   Kid's meal was a small tortilla with melted cheese inside and half a plate of spring mix salad that I don't think many kids would eat.  My son is only 2.5 and normally he eats half a kids meal, this time I had to feed him when he got home.    Overall are bill was about $20 higher than usual and the quality of the food wasn't as good.  Not sure what happened but we definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"If you go here, AND think the food is good - well then you must really, truly be mad. Go to taco bell instead (no I am not being facetious) and save some money AND get flavour.  We ordered:  choriqueso - melted cheese and chorizo. Delicious? sure, I think its hard to mess up cheese and chorizo. The portion size, however, was TINY. and they serve it with three sad looking wrapped up tortillas.  Corn - was cold. I refuse to say anything more about corn on the cob that came out cold  Tacos - we got an assortment: carnitas, fish, pollo, tinga:  - carnitas was dry - fish (the battered one) was so spicy that all you could taste was spice (and I like spicy foods!) - pollo: dry,unmemorable - tinga: tasted like an indian vegetable dish   for dessert we got the churros and tres leche:  - churros: you could tell they were dropped in the fryer without the oil being the optimal temperature because they were super greasy - tres leche: they need to change the name of this cake. it was not soaked at all, just dry and once again, sad looking.   the service left much to be desired, we only got a server if they were flagged down. no hot sauces to put on your tacos, appetizers came out 3 minutes before the mains came out.  Overall if you go here and enjoy the food - then one of us is going mad."}
{"text":"I had the tacos and lemonade and was amazed to learn what an authentic Mexican should taste like.   It was beyond amazing.    The salsa and chips are my personal fave.  I buy them from our local store and enjoy it all the time."}
{"text":"A friend of mine luvs the tortilla chips made by Mad Mexican so while we were visiting one of our go to spots for desserts nearby we decided to drop in. The area is roomy and has an open feel and one can even peer into the massive chip production area in the back. A nice bar on the side and I can imagine it getting busy as there is a dearth of Mexican food in Toronto and TO's folks just flock to this cuisine wherever they find it.  We ordered a trio of tacos to share and ordered the chicken version. Sadly it was too early to have a drink or two so skipped that part.  The service was prompt as the place wasn't busy. The condiments were brought in first and the appropriate harbenero sauce being very hot warning :) The tacos them self were decent. Good corn tortillas, the chicken a bit on the dry side but well seasoned. A decent taco though I am not a connoisseur.   Reasonably priced so I don't see a reason why one wouldn't visit if in the area or craving this type of food. I will probably be back for a drink and some other food offerings."}
{"text":"Tried the steak burrito.   Although it was very tasty the steak portion was small.   The price was fair."}
{"text":"I've had the luxury of eating tacos from the finest restaurants, food trucks and family restaurants in California so when it comes to Mexican food, I've got a bit of a chip on my shoulder.   I came to Mad Mexican with a bunch of co-workers for lunch and although we were a table of around 12 people, the staff seemed unprepared for a table that large.  Our food took forever to come out and even taking orders was an ordeal.  I got the 2 taco combo and ordered a shrimp and fish taco, and what I got was a chicken and fish taco.  Too hungry to bother to complain, I scarfed down my lunch and proceesed to listen to my stomach grumble the rest of the time.  For $13-15 I got 2 tacos which were so small and full of more lettuce than meat, they would barely make an infant full.  Also you can get about the same amount of food in LA for about $3...  Needless to say the food was pricey not very good and the staff took forever to sort out our orders and bills.  I won't be coming back that's for sure.  Seven lives in Toronto puts this place to shame!"}
{"text":"Ordered three different tacos, the Mexican corn, and the Mexican coffee. Very tasty! Everything was well seasoned and fresh. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because the tacos were a little tad too oily. Price is fair, not the cheapest taco place but can't complain. The Mexican coffee was delicious. A nice blend of cinnamon and clove. Our waiter was also very nice and tentative. The atmosphere was comfortable. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm really happy I discovered this place! My new fav restaurant in Bloor west. They also do great catering and it was easy to arrange over email with their coordinator. I placed the order about a week in advance and opted to pick up myself (delivery fee was $50 and I live less than 5 minutes away so that's ridiculous). Nevertheless, my guests were happy with the food and everything was well packaged  We did eat in the restaurant as well. Service was friendly and fast. Food was good and their salsa and guacamole dips were amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh fresh fresh food!!!! Staff is awesome, food is deeeelish and atmosphere very nicely done & classy/uncluttered with more tweaking to come!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE the Mad Mexican & the fact that us \"west enders\" now have a primo spot para comer la cucina Mexicana!!!!  Gracias amigos y hasta la proxima vez!!!!"}
{"text":"Uninspired and tasteless menu.   Good service. Surprisingly busy on a Friday night. Would not recommend unless I didn't like you. Probably a one star situation but my company was good so overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"Staff was great , I enjoyed the atmosphere but the food wasn't anything special. I found it to be rather bland and the portion size was fairly small ."}
{"text":"Stopped Ina s I was working near by.  Nice clean place with the Latin sounds of bands playing over the sound system.  They have a bar that is quaint and a store/market counter you can buy stuff at.  I ordered the tacos.     The ambience is 8/10 The cleanliness 9/10 The staff 10/10. Very knowledgeable. The food 9/10.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My fellow diner and I shared chips & dip, 3 tacos (fried shrimp, fajita, and beef), and the corn.  Everything was tasty, but the corn was our favourite.   Tried guacamole for the first time here and this place did not disappoint! It was so good I bought some from their market (located right inside the restaurant)."}
{"text":"The whole experience was just off.    When we arrived there was no hostess so we stood around trying to get anyone's attention.    The table was missing a set of cutlery and the only way to get service was to flag down a waiter ( it didnt seem like they were short staffed - just preoccupied)  We ordered the chorizo & queso appetizer that was pretty decent, the mexican corn had taste toppings but the corn itself was cold - seems like it was pre-boiled and then barely warmed (one side was warmish the other cold)  Between 3 of us we got 9 tacos - no salsas or sauces were provided and both the chicken and pork tacos were dry to the point of almost inedible.    The churros were SUPER greasy - Im guessing the deep fryer wasnt hot enough and the Tres Leches wasnt the rich moist cake that its supposed to be - more like a pound cake with some whipped cream and lime zest.  I hope this isnt the standard as this strip of Jane gets revitalzied."}
{"text":"Food is great and fresh. The churros are a rip boiiii lemme tell you"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I do know the owner, but I have adored Pepe's food long before he began to share his talents with the wider world.   I used to help him make his tortilla and salsa on his balcony years ago when he was first selling his incredible products at St. Lawrence Market.  He then went on to open the gourmet Mexican restaurant, Frida, on Eglinton which one of my family members said was some of the best food in the city -- something you don't necessarily think of when you think about Mexican food in Toronto.   Pepe has moved on from Friday, but Mad Mexican is going strong. They simply make the best chips and the best salsas I have ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more than I do - it's in my hood, it's a cool space, great service, but the food is just okay - not bad by any means, but it isn't going to make any top ten lists for Mexican food. The food is cooked and presented well but they need to really kick up the spices. They make great tortillas and salsas which you can purchase at the little shop at the front of the restaurant - I definitely recommend those items. I'll probably go there again, in the hopes that the food has improved. I'd really like to see this place do well."}
{"text":"I was really hesitant to come here with the 3 star rating and not so great reviews but I'm glad I gave it a chance. My boyfriend and I first came here on a Saturday night. It was busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table. We came back again yesterday and it was quiet, which we liked.  Atmosphere: - It was nicer than I expected. I like how they have the bar with a TV - The layout is OK overall but it's a turn off if you're seated in certain areas ; e.g. facing towards the washroom area which lacks a main door and is beside the kitchen OR facing into the back where you can see the poor guy washing tons of dishes - The front section where you can walk in and buy salsa, guacamole etc. and pick up your order is great. Saves people the trouble of going to the bar, like other restaurants  Food: - Choriqueso was delicious. My boyfriend loved how cheesy it was. I probably wouldn't get it again unless there was more people to share with. Gotta save room for the tacos! - Nachos was the best I've ever had anywhere. I usually pick at nachos at bars if other people order it but I was never that into it. We ordered it with sirloin steak. The amount of toppings was perfectly proportionate. They didn't come with salsa or sour cream but our server was nice enough to bring us some. - Tacos were amazing. So far on my taco hunt, Mad Mexican is the winner. I liked them so much I came back within 2 days! I had the carnitas de michoan, ensenada style with white fish and sirloin steak. The carnitas was definitely my favourite!  Service: - Both times the servers were nice, but our food took forever to come out! The appetizer always came out within good time, but the main meal took too long. - I think some better training is needed as well. I wanted to try the ceviche and I asked our server about the portion size (individual or shareable). She told me it was like a soup. I had never had ceviche before but based on pictures I always thought it was like a cold salad. So I looked up pictures and sure enough, NOT soup. So that's a fail on their part. - Our server also asked us if we wanted the sauces for our tacos. Um obviously! That should be brought out without asking! - When we came yesterday, they introduced their new menu which hiked up their prices so no more 3 for $12 tacos, unless its lunch. - We ordered 2 carnitas, 2 ensenada and 1 sirloin steak. Our server ended up charging us individually per taco, instead of combining some of them. Not a huge deal but it displays laziness.  Overall, my review seems negative but I really do enjoy the food here. I just think they need to step it up with their service if they want repeat business."}
{"text":"Agreed with most other Yelpers. Opt for another restaurant if you can. Ordered the Dinner for Two; guacamole with chips (OK), molletes de chorizo (definite pass), and 4 tacos (chicken, pork, fish, steak). Everything ranged from OK to \"these tacos all taste the same\". The restaurant itself is nice, and the neighborhood needs a few more restos but this is not what we were hoping for. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Chicken and fish tacos good, but service was slow and wasn't busy at all. We wanted to like this restaurant, but overall it disappointed. Can you believe they didn't even have churros on Cinco de Mayo? Fail."}
{"text":"I just didn't like this place. It was poor value (cost vs. quality and portions) and nothing impressed me. The pickled jalapeños were bland, and I expect more (3 halves) for 6 dollars. I had the La revolucion for the main. It was OK but again it was bland. It needed some crunch. Some lettuce or tomatoes. Something.  Desert. Tres leches. Boring. Service was OK. Had a friend ask for a michelada but they didn't have them. They tried to make one but it tasted like nasty. Also cost extra. Also had someone with an onion allergy.  Asked for onion on the side. They forgot. Overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican foods. Don't want to be a broken record but the salsas are amazing; loved the pico de gallo. Ordered a sandwich and there was so much taste in every bite.   Kind of wish the server would've explained what each salsa is; menu is also a little difficult to understand.   Ordered nachos and salsa for $4.50 and the server discounted it at the end for me since I only went through one round of salsa and apparently the you're allowed two. That was a nice surprise.   I live in the area and this is the type of place I plan to try just about every item on the menu."}
{"text":"This has to be the greatest Mexican food experience I've ever had in Toronto!  The tacos will take your taste buds straight to the streets of Mexico City. The atmosphere is welcoming and simple. The mojitos are perfectly refreshing, as is the lemonade.  An absolute bonus is the fact that you are able to buy their house-made salsas to take home to enjoy. Overall a wonderful food experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered five different tacos. All hit the spot. I cannot wait to bring my friends and have another couple of fish and shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"I mean, who doesn't love tacos, guacamole and chips?   The guac was delicious and the chips were fresh - my companion and I ordered two rounds of chips, as we wanted to make sure that we finished the guacamole.   We both got tacos - very tasty. We also sampled all three offered salsas (mild, medium and hot) - so good.   It's a small place, but fits right in with the neighbourhood. Staff are nice and it's also World Cup-friendly. (They were playing the Australia/Denmark game when we were there)   I plan to go back to try other things. My lunch pal bought a bag of chips and guacamole to go.    If you're in the Bloor West/Baby Point area, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"I just went into this place and it was almost empty. That means there were probably at least 50 seats vacant. I came in by myself and said that I am here by myself.  The waiter proceeded to motion me to sit along the window.  Since the place was almost empty I sat at a 4 seat table there.   The waiter then came over and asked me to sit in the corner against the wall in a 2 seater. It was basically the worst table in the place. I pointed out to him that the place was almost empty and I would prefer to sit where I was. He replied that they were all reserved except that one which is complete nonsense and a bare faced falsehood.   I told him is he sure he wants to do that because it is not cool.  He repeated his song and dance. I walked out.  I will never go to that horrible establishment again."}
{"text":"Ate at Mad Mexican last night and was impressed by the service and the food. I'd walked past this place several times the last few months and wondered what it was like but was put off by some of the yelp reviews. I'm glad I finally decided to check it out. My plan was to have drinks with a friend but when I saw the wonderful looking dishes coming from the kitchen, I was tempted to eat as well. First off, I should start by saying the service was fabulous. From being greeted cheerily at the door, to requesting to be moved to a bigger table because another friend joined us at the last minute, to the very end of the meal when we asked for a split cheque, service was polite, efficient and you definitely felt like you were appreciated as a customer.  I ordered a beer and the chile relleno entree. My dining companions had a variety of tacos. My order was the superstar at our table. Not because the tacos weren't good but because tacos are just tacos and pretty much available everywhere these days. My dish looked amazing and tasted every bit as good as it looked. We were offered three different sauces with our food and I tried all three and thought they were very good (a salsa verde, a chunky tomato salsa and a darker looking chunky sauce that reminded me of an olive tapenade -this last one was spicy and the best of the three). If there was any drawback it was the noise level. This is fine if you are ok with a boisterous and loud atmosphere with your regular crew just to eat and make merry but if you want to have a conversation and really catch up with someone, this would not be the ideal spot.  I am already planning my next visit here and look forward to trying all the non-meat options on their menu. I'll skip the tacos though and take advantage of the fact that this place serves sone really good Mexican food that you might not find on other menus or not done as well."}
{"text":"Unlike other Mexican places, this place not only has tacos but also main dishes.  So tried to order a fish dish. Negative, they are 'out'. So then opted for the mole poblano. It was good, but nothing to write home about.  Ordered a sandwich, again, passes the test but can't remember it anymore.  The space itself is quite nice and spacious. I ordered takeout, and I have no idea how their system works but apparently I wasn't in this once system but was in another. Weird."}
{"text":"I'm not an easy sell when it comes to purchasing prepared prepackaged specialty foods but when I discovered the Mad Mexican some of that thinking changed. I had unknowingly tasted their guacamole, salsa Verde & chips at Frida's and loved it. http://www.yelp.ca/user_details_review_search?userid=EhO5C7t3yfGFLvsTyK5PPw&q=frida   Jose Hadad is the owner/chief cook & bottle washer at Mad Mexican. He cut his culinary teeth under the likes of Mark McEwan and Michael Stadtlander as well as being a George Brown culinary grad. His products which include items such as Roasted Tomatilla Avocado Salsa, along with his benchmark chunky Guacamole are stellar in quality and ingredients.   There is also a line of frozen burritos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) that are chock full of ingredients that make a great quick supper. I've had the beef burritos, baked them in the oven smothered with salsa Verde, cheese and then dolloped a blob of sour cream when served on the plate.   All of Mad Mexican's products are preservative free and have a fairly short shelf life so get gobbling shortly after purchasing. Of course that isn't an issue because when you taste how fresh and pure these products are your food monster will go on a rampage.   You can buy Mad Mexican products and meet Jose face to face downstairs at the Instant Caterer in the St. Lawrence Market. He's usually there on Saturday's pitching his fresh wares and he loves to talk about his products so you know exactly what you are getting.   Hell if the Mad Mexican is good enough to supply Frida's....then it's most definitely good enough for my kitchen. ¡Corra al mexicano Loco y compre, compra, compra el mejor guacamol usted jamás entrará una tienda!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Among the diners that were in our group the food was rated at OK. The lamb seemed to be a hit, but the steak tacos were a bit bland. One person wanted ginger ale and they were out - hard to imagine.   The decor is \"industrial\" and the chairs aren't very comfortable.   In summary I wouldn't come here as a destination but would come back if if was in the neighbourhood anyway."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm..... i don't normally have nachos when i go out but the nachos and guac here were tasty and felt fresh... i believe they may make it on the spot.  I do know they have their own line of nachos.   I had the Revolution, it was a steak sirloin sandwich... darn... thinking about it makes me want to go back.  The sandwich was very tasty and full of flavour.  I found it very satisfying and i didn't feel stuffed at the end.  I found the service friendly and am looking forward to going back.  There are only a handful of good latin food spots in Toronto and this is one of them."}
{"text":"We tried this place twice, loving Mexican as we do. One dish was outright terrible, not even edible, a sour concoction of eggplant and tortillas served in a frying pan. No art of cooking at all.   The sauces were good, but the 4 other dishes we tried were... passable. The only delicious thing we had there was the potato taco.   I tried some of their food last summer at a kiosk down by Union Station, and it was incredible, the sauces among the finest I've had. I doubt very much the same chef was working at the resto the two times we went. Sigh. I so love Mexican!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Bad service.  Waiter Forgot order. Over charged. Waiter excuse herself by saying it was her first day. She said the order got lost. A lot of the food listed on the menu did not exist. Outdated menu.  Menu needs an update with food their actually serving. Waiters need to be trained better and give better customer service. I never been so disappointed with a restaurant like I did here. I was with a group of people and we were all disappointed. Small servings. Will not be coming back. Was not worth my time or money!"}
{"text":"This former food company transitioned into a full service restaurant ~2014 and after the fanfare died down, the Baby Point area is left with a good alternative to Queen Margarita Pizza and the unfortunate Fiddler's Pub for food.  They moved into the former Alfredo's grocery store space and has done the best they can at making it feel more intimate.  Curtains adorn the doorways and festive Mexican murals cover the interior walls.  There is a bar with one flat screen within the same space as dining room.  Service was friendly and attentive- full marks.  The menu was varied- sadly only one burrito option, and no chimichanga or similar. There are several taco options and many traditional entrees including a mole pueblano chicken that included an entire half chicken, refried beans, and a vegetable medley that included brussel sprouts and beets.  Excellent, and great to split between two people.  We also had the guacamole, which was fresh but a little heavy on the onions- still not bad.  And the Mexican street corn- which has become quite popular lately, and they do it well here.  Not as good as nearby Playa Cabana Cantina which finishes the corn on the grill, but tasty nonetheless.  A decent number of craft beers on tap.    Really , the food and service experience was excellent, and they are making the best out of the square box room configuration, but for local a more authentic Mexican experience in the west end try Playa in the Junction or Aztec Mine on Bloor near the Park.  Also worth mentioning they still sell their chips and other Mexican groceries from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican and discovered this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We ordered the Guacamole and Chips, corn, and various tacos. I was pretty excited when I realized this place makes some of my favourite dips, but the food ended up not meeting the same level of tastiness.   The corn was boiled and not grilled so it wasn't very \"Street\" style like the description, the tacos were fine but they were a little dry and bland. Overall the food was OK. Not great, definitely not bad, just a little boring. There sauces are amazing though and highly recommend trying all of them. I love the Tomatillos & Avocados dip."}
{"text":"Went here on a date one afternoon, and the place was super quiet. The staff was super helpful and recommended some wonderful options, and we ended up having margaritas and beers.  The Taco carnes were delicious, as was the guacamole. It's a little bit out of the way,  and a treck to get there on the TTC,  but the bus is right on the route from the subway.   Over all good authentic food,  and price points weren't too crazy.  They also have a take away grocery area too,  for those who want to make the items at home."}
{"text":"Some unreal food here and even better service.   Highlights: cheap drink prices, 10/10 salsa (which you can buy to take home) amazing tacos (corn tortilla tinga tacos were unreal) and the service was beyond A+.   Don't get the jalapeño bars. They suck. End of story.   Everything else was amazing though!  4.8/5 would for sure come back."}
{"text":"Just went to the new location with my wife and 2 kids. Great service!! We loved the fish tacos and the chorizo appetizer."}
{"text":"Delicious meal from start to finish. Creative and perfectly spiced dishes. Good service and a very cool ambience.  Somewhat pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food and service. Great that it's also close to me. They have some unique entree dishes, not just the usual tacos, burritos and enchiladas. My spouse had the awesome chile relleno pablano. My steak tacos were good, a little better than average Toronto taco but not as good as I've had in Texas."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is good. The carnita tacos are crazy good. Everything is so fresh and delicious. The only complaint I have with them is the super uncomfortable seating and they can be persnickety about seating. Like, make two people sit at a two seater even when the place is empty in the middle of the afternoon. But the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. This place is in my top 10 restaurants in the city. And number one in the Bloor West Village/Baby Point area. Yummy"}
{"text":"The moment i entered, i was taken by the beautiful mural on both sides of the wall. Classic, authentic and breath-taking. Service is courteous and friendly. Tables and bar gives the reclaimed wood effect, very appealing. Decent size place. Ordered the 3 soft tacos. Look at the pic. It speaks for itself. Decent amount of freshly cooked meat with just the right amount of cilantro and onions. And the lemonade is fresh and yummy. I finished 2 glasses, and i'm not even a lemonade person. And the best part, you can purchase their awesome salsa and crispy chip bag to take and enjoy at home. Every time i leave here, the next day i plan on when i'm returning back again :)"}
{"text":"I'm editing this review after giving the place another chance - this time dining in instead of ordering take-out (which you'll read below was an awful experience). The tacos were really quite delicious - moist and flavourful. You wouldn't even know they were made in the same place as the take out. I will definitely recommend and go back. My only complaint is that they were quite greasy this time, but maybe that's what made them taste so good! Limonade was great!  ------------------- Their guac and pico is decent and tortilla chips are great - albeit overpriced...   Was excited to try the tacos and called to order - they call themselves a take out joint - and I couldn't get anyone to pick up the phone.  Left a voicemail, but after 20 minutes no one called back. I tried again and finally a woman answered and told me my order for 12 tacos would take 1 hour. It definitely sounded busy in there so clearly there isn't enough staff to properly run the place. Regardless... we decided to order and wait the hour. Unfortunately, tacos were rather disappointing. We tried the chicken, pork, fish, lamb and the beef tacos. All except for the beef were surprisingly dry and bland. Even devoid of salt... Too bad. I will try again one more time and report back!  Note to restaurant: Hire more people!"}
{"text":"I always drive by and wanted to try. I finally got the chance this past weekend! My girlfriends and I went here for girls night out. We had made reservations for 4 @ 7pm Saturday night. Service was great and the food was so delicious! We had the chips, ceviche and guacamole to start all so good! Sangria was delicious! Then we ordered 10 tacos to share, the fish was amazing! Churros were awesome! I told my friends that lived in the area after we left and they came to try on Sunday! I'm making reservations to come back again this week! I am obsessed!!"}
{"text":"Service and food are fantastic! Would highly recommend!! And be sure to have the churros!!"}
{"text":"Mad Mexican recently overhauled their menu making great improvements. Their food has always been made to order fresh and delicious but they made one change I enjoyed. Rather than serving a separate salsa carousel with the tacos, they sauce up the tacos deliciously the way the chef recommends. Now, they just give hot sauce on the side when asked.  The flavours seem to be authentic, and bursting with flavour. What a great resto to have in the hood.  Great for a romantic dinner or a night out with a group of friends at the high top tables. Can't go wrong with Mad Mexcian.. Great value and taste."}
{"text":"A family owned business that is very well run. It is very clean, well maintained, excellent customer service...and the food- omg- amazing.  We are officially regulars.  Update: I realized that the best item on the menu is the  veggie taco. All the meat ones were nothing special. Changing to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went for lunch food was ok,,,,a little bit pricy,,,,3 small tacos for $12.  If you are hungry get ready to open the purse strings"}
{"text":"I was really torn on this review.  It was either going to be a 4 or a 2.  Splitting the difference I ended up with 3.  Edit: upon rethinking I had to go with 2.  If this was a three, nothing could ever be a two again.  Note: If I was just rating their salsas I would give them a 5/5.  I will return to buy their sauces.  They are fantastic.    But that's the thing with this place - they seem like they're experiencing growing pains that they just haven't worked out yet.  The staff are quick and efficient, but that means after three seconds with the menu they want to know what you're going to order.  The item names are authentically written in Mexican.  It took her coming back three times before I even figured out where to look for what I might want.  Finally, so as not to distress her, I just pointed at two pictures and went with it.  I ended up with three tacos and the Revolution sandwich.   The Revolution sandwich was fantastic - but at $12.00 more than a little over priced.  For $12.00 you get a sandwich.  The end.  No salad, no chips, no nothing.  In a day and age where that's enough for a full meal, a sandwich shouldn't be priced like that.  But it was delicious.  5/5 for flavour.  And those chips - that's the problem.  They bring out their three salsas at the beginning but then give you nothing to put them on.  With these prices, you'd think free chips would be a given.  But no, they want you to pay extra for that.  The salsa is just to look at for the 15 to 20 minutes it takes to make your tacos.  The tacos ranged from great, to not so great.  The chicken was dry and without flavour (but the salsas were AMAZING and made up for that.)  The veggie taco was superb!  Very flavourful.  The pork one, I was just ready to leave by the time I was eating it.   Tacos are three for $10.  And they're small.  Once again, price is an issue.  Free chips, and 20% off would make this a 5 star joint."}
{"text":"Would like to give Mad Mexican 5 stars as the food was tasty but unfortunately the service was very poor. We arrived at 6:45 and I don't think our food was delivered to the table until 8 pm. It was a Monday night and the place was less than a third full so delay wasn't due to business. Luckily when the food arrived it was tasty so made up in part for the wait. We tried a variety of tacos and all were good. The portions aren't big so for dinner it is advisable to order at least 3 if not 4 tacos. Dessert did arrive quickly and the churros were hot. The tres leche cake looked scrumptious and was good but the churros were better."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were craving some Tacos so came here.    For the cost, I think there are better places out there.  $5+ a taco is pretty high, and they do not have any specials.  (-1 star for price)  Food (3.5 stars): We ordered: Chicken Tinga (3 stars) - My girlfriend loved it. I thought it was missing some crunchiness.  It was very flavorful, but not your typical taco.  It was almost dripping out.   Ensenada Style (4 stars) - We chose the white fish. It was delicious, but  a bit smaller than expected.  It had a great balance of flavors and texture:  cold and warm, crunchy and soft, spicy and mild.  For desert we decided to get Churros (4 stars).  There were options for having them stuffed, or having the dipping sauce on the side, we chose sauce on the side.  These were tasty and very fluffy.      Service: Friendly service, got water refilled multiple times.  Ambiance: Very specious space, high ceilings.   Extra info: street parking (might not be available during rush hours) credit cards are accepted"}
{"text":"Being from Texas I know Tex-Mex and this house made guacamole beats most Mexican (that's simply \"Tex-Mex\" here in the Lone Star State) joints back home. Great salsa selections as well. And of course, great drink prices.  If you happen to find yourself in Toronto, you may not owe it to yourself, but you certainly owe it to your tastebuds to shovel food here."}
{"text":"Prior to reading the reviews and my first visit, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Was this place a takeout joint only?  Did they only sell ready-made Mexican food?  Was it a sitdown?  So to clarify, it's a small restaurant with a few tables, a counter which, I'm assuming, primarily does takeout based on the area.  I don't think there's full-waiter service as it appears to be quite casual.  In addition to being a restaurant, they also sell things they make in-house like tortilla chips, oils, and various dips such as salsas & guacamole.  Menu is 1 page and there are also NO BURRITOS!!!  There are some apps (antojitos), tacos, soups (caldo), tortas y molletes.  Tacos are $3.50ea and the cashier told me that they are on the small side so usually people order more than 1.    Since I was taking my order to go...in my car...tacos were out of the question, so I got a tortilla soup ($7).  Soup really packed a punch in the flavour department and I thought it was quite flavourful, definitely not watered down!  Not sure if I'd ever be near this Baby Point area, but if I am, I'd definitely stop by again to check out other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"My first visit was for a quick lunch and I was pleased with how fresh the food was and how clean the place was. As someone who lived in Central Mexico, I can certify that the food is \"authentic.\" They have no burritos or flour tortillas, which would make it unauthentic, however, they do have tortilla chips, which are uncommon in Mexico, so that's the only compromise. Their menu offerings also look authentic and inspired, so I'm not sure why so many Yelpers have commented that the menu is uninspired.   There were only five tables occupied when I visited, so the service was friendly and fast. I told both the host and server that it was my first visit, and they answered some of my questions about the place and made me feel welcome. But, they brought me a beautifully-presented tray of their house-made salsas without anything to try them on! I had no basket of tortilla chips or bread with which to try these salsas and my food was seasoned perfectly (i.e., not in need of any salsa), so I could not try the salsas and consider them for purchase at their front-of-store boutique. That was a missed opportunity for them. My Sopa de Tortilla was authentic, balanced, generous, and delicious. My Pollo Yucateco Pibil Taco was perfect: moist, generous, and flavourful chicken housed in fresh, house-made corn tortillas. I had a cup of their brewed Mexican Coffee and it was a good deal at only $1.75 and very heart-warming. I loved how their food was served on enamelware.  I will definitely return to try more of their dishes and have larger meals. Perhaps my opinions of the place will change when I try something more substantial."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Way better than El Catrin which I tried this summer. I had the tacos and leek soup. Both amazing and  the best tacos I've had in the GTA. They recently moved to a bigger location a few doors down making it a full service restaurant. Everything was awesome. The service was great. The owner even came over to give me the wifi password when I pulled out my iPad. Go! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Came her for a quick bite and enjoyed it. Not my typical four star restaurant but for what I expected I was pleasantly surprised. Second time back I was pretty disappointed with the food chicken was extremely dry, pork was really fatty and cod was boring."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner & cocktails tonight and both were fantastic! They make several (at least 4) types of salsa in-house, which is always a good start. I had a spicy margarita with curaçao and habanero, which seems like a weird combination at first, but is really delicious. I loved my fajita burrito, and everybody else's food was great as well. This is very much a \"classy\" rather than \"authentic\" Mexican place, so the portions are a little smaller and the presentation a little crisper, but it has a great, dark, mellow atmosphere and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Mixed feeling but overall it was good.  Appetizers were tasty and quick, we ordered the Sweet Corn and Jalapeno Bars. Moving onto the main course, I was highly disappointed with my tacos: Carnitas (pork) , Ensenada (fish) and Yucatecan (chicken). The chicken and pork were all overcook, all the protein wasn't seasoned at all and the portions were pretty small. It also took a very long time for the tacos to be made, around 20 minutes. Lastly for dessert I ordered the Flan Napolitano and it was very tasty. It was a pretty small portion for $5, but it was delicious. Had a hint of gingerbread to it, don't know if that was intentional or not. Our waiter Mike was very kind and down to earth, I would give the atmosphere a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very fast service and good food.  I ordered three tacos for $10 (pork, fajita and steak) I found both the pork and steak a little dry but flavorful nonetheless. The fajita was delicious and plentiful. BF ordered revolucion sandwich and it was absolutely amazing but did not come with any type of side.  Also ordered freshly squeezed OJ which was a decent size.  Next time we will try the $27 dinner for 2 which seems to be a good deal. House made sour cream is delicious. Stars were lost on dry tacos and that you have to order nachos and salsa ($4, but why not give the first order free?), also we found it difficult to have a conversation as it was loud and echoey.. Restaurant also sells takeaway guac, salsa, coffee, nachos and corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Wasn't too busy on a Wednesday lunch. I think the portions were small and my Mexico friend said the tacos wasn't what he had expected. Soup was delicious but the bowl was super shallow. We ordered 3 tacos, a soup, two pieces of corn and agua de horchata. Bill came to be $35. So it wasn't cheap and we were still hungry."}
{"text":"I'm visiting the area so walked up and got 3 tacos....they were on the small side but OMG so delish.   I want to go back to get more....and more...and more!  Go there....go there NOW!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day with a friend and tried the nachos, they were the best nachos I have ever had. If you order them I would suggest adding the chorizo and guac. While we were pretty full after the nachos, our server recommended the chicken tinga tacos, and they were excellent as well. Service was great. I am already dreaming of those nachos and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here off Uber eats. 4 tiny tiny flautas for $11 plus delivery and tax came up to $17.50 for basically a snack for a 4 year old. Absolutely horrible, not ordering from here again. Overpriced"}
{"text":"Mad Mexican is really all over the board as a restaurant. Their salsas are great. Tacos are very good, but for the price it's a ripoff. Add in the fact that the guacamole is $8 and miniscule, you find yourself with a place to skip. Lots of options in Toronto for food; no need to get short changed for your money."}
{"text":"I always feel good about myself when I am purchasing products similar to what Mad Mexican offers:  - prepared in Canada - ingredients locally sourced - All Natural with no Preservatives - Handmade  And if you have special dietary requirments, you should know that all their products are Gluten Free  Their Salsa Verde is one of the better ones I had in Toronto as it has a strong taste of cilantro... which I love.   You can found their products in most of the better food stores in the GTA area like Pusateri's and McEwan!  Can I just served it and pretend I made it? :)"}
{"text":"I really like Mad Mexican and am glad they moved to a larger location!  The restaurant is always full at a comfortable level- eg you never wait too long and there is always a seat for two available in a few minutes.  The staff are super friendly and the Carnitas tacos are amazing.  I recently tried the sopas and those were also fantastic.  Also: love the beer and cocktail selection!  And the fact that you can take out the salsas (they are a tad expensive, but when you are in a rush, they are great!)  Only issue- actually similar to playa cantina- is that the volume is very high, so tough to get in a meaningful conversation on a busy day."}
{"text":"delivery staff are often blocking the laneway with deliveries.  Today was a classic.  others in the neighbourhood cannot access their own residences.  they have a business in the neighbourhood but can't be careful with respect to the use of the lane that all of us must use.  Their delivery trucks damage signs on the poles and before this store was here we had none of these issues.  Hard to support them when they don't support their neighbours."}
