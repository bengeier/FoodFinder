{"text":"Great little coffee shop and welcome addition to the area. I live in the area and love going for my daily walk and grabbing a tea at the same time. Staff are courteous and friendly. Beautiful atmosphere and a nice break from the franchised coffee shops out there."}
{"text":"Hope this place does well. The location is cursed and I have seen at least 4 businesses fail miserably in this exact same location. Looks inviting.  Never looks busy. Might check it out."}
{"text":"This little cafe is the needle in a hay stack!   I say if you are looking for a cute and quiet place for a date, I suggest you take your date here. It's absolutely beautiful in this small cafe. It's well decorated and just beautiful. Although the outside isn't such a great view.   The staff, she was kind and helpful. I'm glad I was able to find this cafe."}
{"text":"Just absolutely love the environment here. It's really nice and cozy and is an amazing place to bring your date. There is no loud obnoxious people, at least when I was there and it's very rustic. They have a full book shelf to just hang out by yourself or play games if you're there with someone. Definitely a must visit place."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem... it puts me in a tough position because I want more to know but at the same time I don't. LOL.  Ultimately if you love a cafe that's local owned, where everybody knows your name (if you want them to) and is quieter and more like home than the big chains, you will love it here and call it a second home much like I do!"}
{"text":"The cafe is very nice. Love the library touch. I know they are not very busy but they need to be aggressive and have all the items on the website and on the menu available. it is the cost of doing business. It is a beautiful place and I hope it catches on as it is off the main roads. What I have had is great,"}
{"text":"Super great place!!! Staff was pleasant, coffee was strong and fresh.  Ambiance is great comfy couches and seating, feels like someone's really nice spacious living room.  Great hang out place, quiet place to work or meet up with friends.  I hope all us  pickering residents do our part to frequent this place, buy stuff and keep it in business!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Love the atmosphere of Ray's Cafe.  Bright, Quiet, Spacious and Clean.  There are various seating options so it is good for solo or as a group. There are also artwork for sale from local artists which is a nice touch for a local cafe.  Cappuccino ($3.45) is A-OK compatible to franchise quality. Don't expect crafted quality brews.  Great neighbourhood cafe to meet up with your friends or just do some work on your computer with their free wifi access."}
