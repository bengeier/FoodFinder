Nice building...inside... But nothing more!"}
{"text":"Just got back from our second meal at the Blue Snapper and can't wait to go back.  
Both people I dined with RAVED about the lobster bisque which only made me jealous as I have an allergy to shellfish.  Our friend has been back 3 times for this soup alone.
I ordered the macadamia crusted grouper with a mango salsa that was INCREDIBLE!  The chef should not only be complimented but kissed with wild abandon. Everyone loved their meals.
First, I'm not a big fish fan, but this was so..not fishy, but sweet, buttery, flavorful, nutty and delicious, I refused to stop even when I was full. This fish is so good it should be illegal."}
{"text":"This place is a local favorite for my coworkers and I. The food is decent and the service is respectable, but what makes the Blue Snapper cool is the patio area. It is a tiki theme with all the beach decorations. It is also very spacious and there is ample seating. They have a great happy hour and even have live bands there on certain nights. It is really nice as long as the Cleveland weather cooperates! Their lunch specials aren't amazing but they are good enough to make this place a regular stop. I will continue to give them my patronage!"}
{"text":"It was a decent time but I've experienced better.
 
My friends were there to talk to.   (Happy 30th Nick!)
'T & Rich dueling pianos' were there to listen to.  (Always a great show)
The patio was open and the heaters were on. 

The bartenders clearly favored the regulars and I felt rather unwelcomed as a result.  When I arrived I asked a bartender on their beautiful outside patio bar what beers were on tap - The response I received was:
\"We don't serve draft beers on the patio\".  
Yet, All night long that very same bartender was bringing draft beers from the inside to other customers on the patio.  Also I had to wait longer for my drinks than other customers.  It wasn't in my head - These bartenders had something against outsiders.  Finally I just started going inside for my drinks - They had a few uncommon drafts that I enjoyed.  
We didn't have any food.

Thank goodness for the friends I brought and the live show they had.
They added a star and made the Blue Snapper Grill a two star time."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but not fantastic. Service was okay, too. But, they were out of many of the items on the already limited menu. The waiter explained that they are closing for renovations soon, hence the low inventory. I might try again once they reopen."}
{"text":"I don't know if you can tell from the picture, the little logo creature is an adorable cartoon. That is what really called out to me and made me want to drink there. It is the cutest little thing. You can get a good view of it on this link:

There are cool electric palm trees in the front. I heard a lot of single older women hang out there. I couldn't really tell. I heard the patio is really nice in the warm weather. The bartender told me pizza was $5 on Wednesdays, so I ordered one. It was not bad at all. This was a pleasant place to be. I enjoyed drinking alone there a couple of times. Now, seriously, if you don't check out that website and see that creature, you won't see him anywhere!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Leftover Vhooda design inside and out. Leftover recipes too. Generally not a good idea to make no changes to a failed restaurant."}
