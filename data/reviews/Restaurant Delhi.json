{"text":"We stopped by here the other night, noticing it was new to the neighbourhood. It's tucked into a corner next to a bank, and easy to miss, but we are so glad we tried it! The decor is very simple and functional, and they seem to have a small menu, but man is the food good! The owners were so kind and gracious, and the prices are super reasonable for the portions and quality. My personal favourite was the spinach with paneer, great fresh spinach flavour and a velvety texture. Butter chicken and naan also excellent. Really high quality, clearly freshly cooked from scratch food. I really hope this place sticks around - we will be regular customers."}
{"text":"This fairly new restaurant just sprouted on the Plaza near to my place so I had been curious to try it for a while. I finally went in today to try an assortment of things, and got it to go.

The menu is very small, with mostly vegetarian offerings (butter chicken for meat eaters) kept in a heated counter at the till. There are a few combos to choose from but from what I experienced it was somewhat flexible (I asked for 3 smaller portions vs 2 regular ones which they gladly did for me).

I found the good to be pretty tasty and the prices to be fair. The naan is made to order from what I saw (visible from the front counter) so that's nice.

Like the other reviewer pointed out, it is more of a fast casual place, but food didn't disappoint. I'll be back I'm sure, whether for takeaway or to sit in with friends for a casual meal. Service was very nice!

Bottom line: welcome to the Plaza! We needed more variety and for a smaller no-frills family run place, I'm quite happy :) Over time it would be nice to see some improvements to the decor, but focusing on the food first is fair."}
{"text":"Perfect to go Indian place- very good food and cheap! Dinner from $9 to $12 and everything tastes fresh. My only complaint is that it's not very spicy, but, for this, I blame the white people (we ruin everything)."}
{"text":"C'est vraiment bon et propre, c'est la première fois que je goûte à la cuisine indienne. Je le recommande"}
{"text":"I had delicious veggie combo with two stews, rice and naan ( which was being made as I was paying). Very friendly young man at the counter told me that it is dad and him running the place with emphasis on cooking fresh ingredients every day. Had Chai to die for. Highly recommendable if you are looking for simple, but authentic Indian meal."}
{"text":"Casual fast indian food, just a few choices if you are hurry its perfect and fast because every thing is already heating in the \"comptoir\" : cafeteria style."}
