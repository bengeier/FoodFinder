{"text":"Wtf. Ordered from just eats and this was so expensive. I didn't get the right order..calamari is small, pitas are flicking hotdog buns..wow..ghetto....so disappointed 

HOT DOG BUNS STUFFED IN A BAG...wow so Greek...

I want my money back ."}
{"text":"I've had bad food before and usually I don't mind it too much, but this was just too crap. An absolute waste of $30. How does greek food that cost almost 3x as much as Jimmy The Greek taste 10x worse? 

I got a chicken souvlaki that came with barely any chicken which was rubbery and just bleh, the potatoes looked and tasted disgusting. I threw my \"Greek\" fries in the trash because not only were they soggy AF, it looked like someone had diarrhead all over them. My \"garlic bread\" was just some shitty soggy hotdog bread, I could make better garlic bread at home. My spinach rolls were soggy just as well. I have a feeling they don't make their food on the day, and they just microwave shit.

If you're expecting some delicious, authentic food that tastes good, this place is fucking terrible. I mean I saw all the reviews, but I love Jimmy The Greek and they don't do delivery so I thought this would be a nice substitute. This place is just gross. Should've just went to Nando's or Jimmy. As soon as I got my food, I went and ordered pizza cause I ain't eating that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Chicken gyro was good. Pita was fresh, chicken was a mix of light and dark meat. I had the sauce on the side and no red onion. 

Overall, not a bad place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Best value in town. The Pikita menu, two for $ 30 ($ 33 for take-out) is an incredibly good value for the money. Every morsel was fresh and tasty. 

Our waitress was friendly, observant and friendly.

We are over 14,000 residents in CityPlace, I hope more of us will enjoy this restaurant.

Just go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here in 2 weeks. Food is excellent! Portion sizes were very generous. Price is standard for any Mr. Greek. Service by staff was super friendly. Definitely my go to Greek restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Poor service and bad quality food... Waitress got three of our orders wrong and took forever to do anything. The food was quite honestly gross. The greek salad and the garlic bread were soggy. The menu is also very confusing and doesn't describe anything well, for example, we ordered food expecting one thing and a totally different thing came. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered from this location a few times and although there have been hiccups before, I have never complained or felt completely disappointed.  Yesterday was unfortunately not the case, when placing the order I requested that the delivery person would be notified that they would have to break a larger bill and was assured that was not a problem...this was not the case but he did come equipped with the machine so no harm done.  Then I noticed that the potatoes were very salty, and did call to let them know for other people's food, the manager apologized and offered a credit for the potatoes next time.  I tried to salvage the meal with the extra tzatziki, but ended up vomiting and ill all evening, this time there was harm and it was foul.   I then called the manager again to express how painful this experience was and was offered 15% discount the next time I order...I have to say this was not a great ending or treat for the weekend.  I'm very disappointed that this is the caliber of customer service that was offered for such a large franchise."}
{"text":"It's really ugly inside. Tables were dirty and had a big fish staring at me the entire time. Felt kinda bad for it, the aquarium was too small for the poor thing. The food was pretty tasty though."}
{"text":"For a place that opened not to long ago, customer service is really bad. There is no friendly staff and it even seems that you are bothering. Food is good though, but for the price, which is the same as any other place you can go here and Toronto, you can definitely look for a place where staff makes you feel welcome. Even McDonalds has better customer service that this place. SUGGESTION: Change your staff and see how the place starts having more customers.... you have a great location, you should take advantage."}
{"text":"An overall nasty experience from top to bottom:
1. My wife's salad had a big hair in it.
2. The pork in my pita was processed meat and tasted disgusting. 
3. My food took over 20 mins to prepare, even though they had about 6-7 staff in the kitchen (although they were mostly socializing).
4. The food tasted bad, not surprising, since they likely use low quality ingredients. 
My advice, stay away from this dump, unless you like crappy food."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the past 6 months. We kept coming back due to the previous experiences we had from when they opened until about August. 

Last time I came it took 45 minutes to get take out after the employee up front told us 20 minutes. Then when we got home all of our food was not what we ordered. Fried calamari instead of grilled, got potatoes and rice instead of rice and fries like we asked, and they gave us pitas when we asked for garlic bread. 

The worst part is the service. I asked to speak to the manager after the food was taking so long and a man came out and gave the most condescending answers, telling us we just had to wait as long as it took, there was nothing he could or would do. 

When the owner is on site it is a little better, but even then he has let standards fall since they opened. I joked with one of the waitresses about how well they are reviewed on google and she said management makes them write fake reviews, makes sense now. 

Over all bad experiences. Never going back."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. We had the gyros dinner. It was good. The restaurant itself is cute and they've tried to incorporate touches from Greece, and in particular, the island of Santorini in their decor. Negatives - they didn't fill up the tzatziki container, and then they charge you $1.00 for an extra one. My only real complaint however was with the service. I found the waitresses were not that attentive, and could do a better job checking in with the customers to see how their meal is, ask them if they'd like more water, more bread, etc. This was definitely lacking. To me, service is as important as the food itself, and hopefully in time, this will improve."}
{"text":"I went to mr Greek at 1000 finch this past Sunday and I should say I have never received a bad service like this before ! Our waitress didn't engage with us at all and the food ( mixed gyros plate + souvlaki sticks ) were very dry ! The salad was old and soaked into the dressing !

I also ordered tea which was for 1.95 and when she brought us the bill it said 2.25 ! I brought this to her attention saying that it's not about 30 cents it's about the principal ! She got all nervous as she already knew about this and was surprised that someone actually noticed this discrepancy!

Overall I don't think this mr Greek should even get 1 out of 5 ! 
You certainly can have better food and service at other Greek Resturant .
Don't recommend this location at all !"}
{"text":"This place has potential (so it's an optimistic two stars from me), but boy, do they have a lot of other kinks to work out and areas to improve on. Overall, too many negatives for me to recommend. I'd suggest going a bit later, in a few weeks, when (hopefully) their kitchen and service have got their act together.

Our order: Pork souvlaki with rice and Greek salad, and Beef/lamb gyros with rice and Greek salad, to-go

Let's start with the positives...

Pros: 
- Food was fresh, souvlaki meat was flavourful, juicy, tender.
- Rice was fluffy with individual grains (not sticky and clumpy), with a nice bit of tomato sauce on top.
- Pitas were thicker, fluffier, Greek-style Pitas, warmed, and your choice of whole wheat or white.
- Small container of thick tzatziki on the side so your food isn't pre-slathered and overwhelmed.
- Also has a dine-in area if you don't want take out.

Now, the issues...

Cons:
- Upon entering, you're right by the cash to give your order, except the menu is not up. The big board above the counter just advertises some of their special dishes, with no pricing available. Instead, we were looking around for the menu, and eventually spied a pile on the counter, which we had to find and grab ourselves. 'Twas a confusing first impression.
- At around 8:30pm (post-dinner rush?), a lot of people were milling about, waiting for their orders. We heard some people were waiting up to 30mins for their order, so we knew we had a wait ahead of us. Probably ended up taking 20mins to get our order.
- NOT a relaxing environment. This Mr. Greek location has only been open for a week or so, so it seems that they're still trying to figure out how to run the place. Staff looked visibly stressed as they were trying to figure out how to assemble the orders in sequence, on time, and then have them given to the right customer. It was not working well, and so with the shouting, scrambling, and anxious faces, just know that this is not yet a nice and relaxing place to eat yet.
- Both our orders were incomplete. Both Greek salads were missing. So we essentially paid $30+tax and tip for a plate of rice with meat, and the two small pitas. Not a vegetable nor garnish in sight.
- The beef/lamb gyro was dry.

So now you know.  They do some foods well, like the souvlaki, and if you're lucky, you'll pick an off time when they're not stressed, and are able to complete your order. But this place has a lot of work to do, so it's yet to live up to its franchise reputation."}
{"text":"Sooooooo slow! 
They also seem to prioritize orders taken by phone/online over in-person orders. 
I really wanted to like this place but it's poorly managed most of the time and the quality is below average."}
{"text":"Slowest place ever. Do not come here. Was hoping to grab a quick meal but waited for take out for 40 mins. The staff is incompetent and inefficient. I saw the waitress spill sauce on the ground and it was still on the ground until I left. Worst place ever"}
{"text":"I've picked up food and also had it delivered from this restaurant... each time I loved their food! Delicious... and always exactly how I ordered it!!  
Sorry, but I cannot understand the negative reviews."}
{"text":"Visited the location with family, very disappointed. There was a fly in my salad!!!! I opted out for cooked veggies. When they brought those, there was a hair in the veggies!!!
The chicken was super dry and very salty.
To make matters worse, they still charged for the (fly) salad and the (hair) veggies on the bill!!!! Will not be going back there 100% ! Do NOT recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I had initially thought it was closed because it was empty and dark inside. However, I was in the mood for well seasoned grilled chicken and rice, thought this would be something like Jimmy the Greek and decided on a chicken souvlaki dinner. Did take out as it felt like a ghost restaurant and it was a little too quiet/eerie. 

Chicken skewers are incredibly small (they were probably on 4 inch long skewers, little meat), rice was overcooked and bland, pita was burnt but the salad was decent. Service was fine however I feel as though if you finally get a customer it might be good customer service to get off your phone. Once she did, she was helpful. 

Food isn't good, service is meh, inside has an eerie vibe. Don't waste your time/money, you could probably go to Jimmy the Greek at centerpoint, pay way less and get way more. If food court food can do better, might be best to skip this."}
{"text":"To be honest the food was so so. The waitress was extremely incompetent. Kept forgetting about our order  and we waited in total an hour to get food and pay. Although she was warm and friendly. I would recommend take out here if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mr. Greek is a chain. Chains are supposed to be predictable and reliable (never said anything about quality!). But this Mr. Greek, for some reason, fails the live up to the mediocrity of its tzaziki brethren. Can't go here again. (Side note: this place has taken up shop in a unit that is notorious for not giving businesses a long shelf life)"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner and was surprised to find out that you only had the choice of 1 side (salad, rice, potatoes). I would rate the Greek place at Eaton Centre food court higher than this place. The food quality was typical fast food greek quality."}
{"text":"Terrible service at getting in ! Put our name down for a table outside and we were next on line and all of a sudden 2 more people came in and sat down at the empty table we wanted out side ! When we ask if there was a special way to get table outside they said no & I told her what happened and she shrugged shoulders and walked away from us"}
{"text":"The wait for food was crazy and the food was definitely not up to par for mr Greek, I ordered the saganaki and it was very under cooked and the chicken was very dry I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The location at Yonge and 16th closed down a while ago, and honestly I was kind of upset when it closed as I really, really love their red sauce. It is probably the only reason I keep going back- that rice and potato sauce.

When I found out a Mr.Greek (Express) opened on Bathurst and Rutherford I was so happy I can finally have my red sauce again! (When you have cravings, they need to be fulfilled!) 

My boyfriend, my mom and I came here for dinner Saturday, and I don't think I have experienced this type of disappointment at a Mr.Greek - ever. 

It was 9pm, they close at 11. There were 2 tables finishing up when we walked in, so it was not busy at all. This is an express location so you order at the cash, pay and they bring the food to your table. 

I understand that this is not full-service but man, the people that worked here could not give any less of a you-know-what to be there. It was almost like there was no communication between the girl at the cash to the girl who served the food or to the kitchen staff.

We ordered 3 meals - 2 original chicken souvlaki, and a beef meal as well as fried calamari and a side order of  rice with extra red sauce. 

We waited over 30 mins for the bread to come, and it came at the same time at the fried calamari, which was somehow undercooked and you guessed it - disappointing. A minute later one side salad came to the table - when there should have been 3 of them, and I asked the waitress about it - her response was \" oh well, here is one for now\" ... customer service at its finest eh?

Almost everything was served was slightly above cold to the touch, and took way too long to come out. The side of rice did not even come till we were 3/4 done our meal, and I had to ask about it twice.  I just don't understand how service, food and timing could all be bad at a point where we were the only table in the place. 

Needless to say not ever dining in again, I will just have to pre-order my red sauce to go."}
{"text":"Was in the area so I thought I would give this joint a try.   The place was empty on a weekday at peak lunch hour.   The staff was very friendly.   The food came out relatively quickly and was edible but was not the best fast casual Greek food I have had.   This is not a destination but an acceptable option if in the area and looking for Greek food."}
{"text":"Food was horrible, table was sticky, saganaki didn't get on fire so the cheese was uneatably bitter. Never going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location once before and only returned to give them a second chance, but my experience turned out to be identical. Although delivery is quick and free and over the phone customer service is great, which I greatly appreciate, there are many problems with the food.


The tzatziki is literally flavourless: not garlicky, not tangy from the greek yogurt, literally tastes like nothing. The classic gyro meat is flavourless as well, barely tastes like meat, is EXTREMELY dry, and leathery in texture. After attempting to drown my meat in extra tzatziki to bring moisture back to my mouth, I ran out as they only give a tiny container when you ask for extra. I also got the spicy feta appetizer, which is listed on the menu to serve 4, but only comes with one pita. I ordered an extra because I knew it wouldn't be enough, but a dent was barely made in the feta before I ran out of pita. 

I understand that some of these problems are the general chain's fault, but the dryness of the meat and the flavourless tzatziki... I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing place to be, people are really nice!!!!  I had the opportunity to talk to the owner and he's a great person to meet!!!Food its great!!!!
Good quality and quantity!!!!
I will recommend it to my good friends and family."}
{"text":"This is the closest restaurant to my work, it is in the ground floor and I work on the second. The food is always fresh, delicious. The variety of plates might be surprising. The Greek man is always polite and often helpful if you can't make your mind about the choice of food.

Prices are a bit higher than at other similar places but reasonable. And it depends on what you are actually ordering. 

I've visited the place several times and about 3 times we just ordered take away. I'm pleased with the service and taken the fact that there is nothing else besides st.louis at Finch/Dufferin intersection, Mr.Greek is indeed recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different Greek restaurants before, it's my favourite type of food, I was shocked at the price and quality of Mr.Greek in Pickering. The meal came to $32 and all we got was a Greek salad with one small piece of souvlaki, and 2 souvlaki pitas. The pitas had nothing to them, 2 pieces of tomatoes and a few onions, the souvlaki was so small a child would be hungry after eating it. My salad was dripping in dressing, to the point that I could not consume the bottom as every piece of lettuce was dripping with dressing. The souvlaki reminded me of Marc Angelos package meat, not authentic at all and I guarantee everything was pre cooked. The restaurant was bare no one was in there and I went at 1pm. It won't be long till this restaurant closes. I will stick to Jimmy the Greek, and Milos Greek in Pickering. So many regrets I have not going to one of those places today for lunch, I'm currently eating chips and dip as I left starving. Total rip off!!"}
{"text":"Just ate it and the Chicken is extremely rubbery. Everything else tasted like it was really low quality, which I shouldn't be surprised as it is a Mr. Greek after all. I can't really say I had high hopes for this place and Can't wait till this closes in 6 months. Everyone in Cityplace hopes a breakfast joint opens like a Sunset Grill as this area desperately needs something like that and not a cheap fast food chain."}
{"text":"Mr. Greek

Earlier today, I called the restaurant prior to placing my Order and advised the lady I want the red sauce on the side, she asked me to put it on the notes when placing my order with Uber eats, so I went ahead and placed the order and in the notes I stated \"Please put the red sauce on the side, not on the rice and not on the potatoes. Thanks\"

I called the restaurant 20 mins. later and asked if the food is ready or not? The same lady said \"yeah it's ready actually but I forgot to mark it ready on the Uber eats app\", I said to her \"well the driver will take some time to get to you and since the food was ready a while ago I'm guessing it will be cold when it gets to me\", she said it will be fine.

Uber delivered the food, even though I've requested NO sauce to be placed on the rice they still put the red sauce on the rice, and there was NO red sauce on the side so I didn't have sauce for the Greek fries either.

The chicken tasted old and nasty, really nasty and old, it tasted like it was placed in the microwave, I'm guessing they warmed it up in the microwave since the restaurant made a mistake and not marked the order ready in their Uber app on time, so they most likely heated it in the microwave, and you should know that chicken tastes very bad if placed in the microwave, I know how chicken tastes if it was placed in a microwave and this tastes likes it was.

You can go to google and search \"microwave chicken tastes bad\" and read what everyone says.

I have a picture of the chicken and also left overs if you are interested to see it in person, it looks so dry and nasty and tastes very nasty.

This really ruined my day.

I am curious what the ministry of health will think about this, and if they actually care! I'll be making a report with them, Let's hope they do.


This is the last time I order from Mr. Greek, I should have ordered from Me Va Mee instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right next door to my Toronto Marriott Courtyard airport hotel. I had the lentil soup (best I've ever tasted) and a delicious trout entree. Great service and great food. The Argentine Cabernet was perfect too!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast.  Hard to mess up on chicken souvlaki, but they did. Rubbery chicken, al dente rice?? Pretty bad.  Used to be the place to go to.   Now there are so many better options.   Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Finally opened! 

As with every new business, there are still a lot of things to fix. I cannot comment on dining in as I always bought takeout. Compared to The burrito place around the corner, the meat is not dry at all. I really like the beef and lamb gyro! I have eaten it 3 times!

The staff are friendly and do their best to answer all questions that you have. Give them a bit of time to get on their feet! They have a lot of potential compared to overpriced sushi and St.Louis beside it."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and always had great service, never too long a wait for service or for the food. 
I always get the saganaki and it's delicious everytime! 
Their saganaki is delicious, hits the spot. I have also had their lamb chops which were cooked just right. 
I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like Greek food, especially gyros so I was excited to see Mr. Greek open not too far from my home. I stopped in for some takeout on my way home from work.

The location is nice and bright, with high ceilings. The staff were friendly.

I ordered the Original Traditional Gyro meal with rice, pita bread, and Greek salad. It was still warm when I got home but I have to say I was a little disappointed. The meat was kinda dry and the rice was a bit mushy. I wonder if dining in would have made a difference..."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing . We had the chicken skewers with roasted veggies , oregano fries and a Greek salad. The veggies were the best part cos the chicken was terrible. We are big meat eaters and still we had to leave some chicken behind. It was over cooked and too smoky in my opinion. Felt like I was eating meat coated in soot. Nope. Not going back."}
{"text":"Food is okay and very expensive..they charge $14.50 for what is suppose to be two sticks of chicken..they only give 5 very small pieces of chicken.  I asked for romain lettuce, they give iceberg lettuce.  No value for your 
dollars."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional!  Super clean!  Super new!  Food is great.  I will be making this a go-to!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a greek restaurant and i was expecting a lot but the service first of all was awful and my water was empty the whole time. I also asked for a Gyro which just came as meet and that's not what i ordered. Also i ordered it with rice and i got french fries which i did not want. They didn't bring the order out all at once they waited for the youngest girls meal to come out until we were all almost done eating. Overall i do not recommend it and i would not go back."}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago with my fiancé for lunch. I ordered the pork souvlaki, she had the chicken souvlaki along with two village salads, calamari and saganaki. Everything was ok until I had a few bites of my pork souvlaki. I barely made it home in time and to the washroom. I was sick for days and will never come here again! I should have read the reviews before going here! Stay away for your own health! Send only the people you don't like!"}
{"text":"I have definitely had better Greek food... I was a little disappointed when i came here for a quick dinner before class. I ordered the Moussaka, which came with veggies, salad and a pita. I really liked that the veggies included zucchini, very different! The salad was pretty meh, it had two olives a bunch of lettuce and two pieces of tomato, along with some crumbled feta cheese on top... way too much lettuce, not enough other fixins! 
The moussaka was okay, it was seasoned nicely, fluffy on the top but with minimal eggplant...why skimp on the eggplant in an eggplant dish? 
The service was quick and they were really friendly. 
I don't think i will be back/ recommend this place to anyone looking for great Greek food, it was a bit of a let down!"}
{"text":"Waste of time waiting around for our orders. Staffs were so slow and got confused about the orders. Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I came here for take out on a Friday night, and as expected it was a tad bit busy, which I didn't mind at first. Super friendly staff, but the service overall was a bit slow, there were only 2 people ahead of me and it still took about 30min to get our food. 

The food was honestly pretty delicious, 
We got the Vegetable Plate , Falafel Plate & the Classic Chicken Souvlaki Plate. My favourite sides were the potatoes, which is served in a delicious tomato sauce & the rice which was so yummy! 

Next time, I will definitely call ahead and place an order to save myself some time.

Definitely a great option if you're in Pickering and have got a craving for Greek Cuisine. 


Heads up, it is a bit pricey though, just these 3 items on their own came out to $44 +tax"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, wasn't great. Hard rice, burnt garlic bread. Didn't even receive the pitas we paid for with the tatziki. Should offer more vegetables in the vegetables with the dinner. It's just zucchini. 
Greek salad is good, ask ordered fried calamari which you would think would be soggy when ordering delivery. But it was actually pretty good, and a large portion. 
2 Slovakia dinners, 2 appetizers $65"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. I had the Chicken Slouvaki dinner, which included \"Mr Greek Potatoes\" I was expecting a chain level of quality...I was sadly disappointed. Lets go item by item:

The Grilled Chicken: most decent part of the dinner. It was charred nicely and held enough flavor to support the chicken individually. 

Mr.Greek Potatoes: Over cooked. Not flavorful. In a kind of red/tomato sauce, with the tomato sauce you'd think there would be an additional heap of flavor but sadly there was not and seemed to only hinder the potato and add to the overcooked mushy quality of the piece. 

Salad: It was okay, but over seasoned with oregano. The only thing worse than an under-seasoned plate is on that is over-seasoned. 

there was sadly no rice included in the dinner as most chian greek places seem to carry. 

WORST by far is the \"garlic seasoned bread\"...now, being a greek restaurant I would assume there would be any other kind of bread then a hot dog bun. Its straight up a hot dog bun that has been buttered and flavored with what would seem to be some sort if pre-made shaker style seasoning. I think I'd rather just not have the bread than a hot dog bun.

I also had the tiropita as an app. also...AWFUL. the philo dough was burned and the whole thing tasted like burnt toast. There was little flavor in the ricotta filling. While in traditional tiropita highlights the flaky buttery pastry with the smooth riccota filling lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, held together delicately by egg...this however was not. the ricotta was not flavored well, and it seemed too eggy or overcooked...where the smoothness was just crumbly. and again. the pastry tasted like old burned toast. 

basically...dont bother."}
{"text":"First time in this Mr Greek on Bremner near Rogers stadium. Met at door by smiling staff member. Busy kitchen open to view the rotating meat which wafted nice smells as the busy cooks went about their business. Food was great after recommendations by the friendly waitress. As it was my first time I wasn't knowledgeable on the offerings. Ordered a glass of wine with my meal that was almost too much to eat. Definitely recommend. affordable, good service, quality food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, with the exception that the lettuce in the Greek salad look old or perhaps has been out for to long. Service was amazing what a nice Spanish girl ."}
{"text":"Went in, people were crowding the till so I sat down. Waited to be served.... All the people that had been ordering at the till were now sitting... I went up to the till to order my dine in order... Never had that experience at other locations.

Got my food quickly and the portion size was generous.

My extra skewer of chicken was the size I get everywhere else but the chicken in the dinner was enormous which tasted gamy, I had to inspect it several times to see if it was chicken, cooked properly and other worries I had about it.

The place was clean and staff were friendly.

Will only visit again out of convenience."}
{"text":"No wow factor here. Despite being very busy on a Sunday evening I found the food and service here very bland and actually priced higher than other similar Greek food joints. Not the worst Greek food that I have had but definitely far from the best.  The menu here is actually very confusing as well. You have to pay for extras here. I  definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to several other Mr. Greeks but was disappointed with this one. The Good: For a food court, the prices are basically on par with everyone else, the portions are generous and its basically cafeteria style service.  The Bad: I had the Pork dinner for $8.95 and it  was very bland. Other Mr. Greeks I have been to seem to marinate their pork longer and with more spices. The potatoes were also very tasteless as well, this dish was definitely missing the all important \"wow factor\".  I usually don't visit this mall and I definitely won't come back here but I have not given up on Mr. Greek just yet."}
{"text":"You yelpers are a bunch of whiny babies! These guys are slammed , food came quick , tasted great, and the portions are decent too! Hats off to the staff kicking butt in that tiny kitchen trying to keep up. 

I will be back, this place will be a mad house during Jays games!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! The chicken was rubbery, the taziki tasted off, the rice was Al Dente and the potatoes were dry!  Worst $21 I spent on lunch ever ( tip included because the waitress was nice).

My friends and I used to go to Mr. Greek at Yonge and 16th once a week for dinner. This place does not compare.

Truly a disappointment"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Management would not take responsibility for their mistake by accepting that his staff misinformed me about the content of my meal. Instead of simply returning my money, he said \"it's not my fault if a customer doesn't like their food.\""}
{"text":"Food better than I expected given it's a Mr. Greek (chain food). Got the Pikilia, which is a shared order for two people, for $29.99 which was good value. Lots of meat. Gyro, slouvaki, biktekia, and chicken gyro. Also came with greek salad, and two sides. 

The host and waitress were very friendly. 

Maybe because they are new the waitress didn't think of giving us our own plates to put our food on, so had to ask for those. Other than that great service and not a big complaint"}
{"text":"Mr greek is the same everywhere is the way I see it!
This is a newer spot in the area so thought i'd give it a shot, it's a pretty quite place most of the time, there isn't much traffic at the restaurant although the plaza is always busy..
The spot itself isn't too great, in terms of location, it used to be a couple of restaurants before this one that didn't do too too well, so hoping that things will be different for this one, can't go wrong with Greek Food! :)
I'll give it 3/5"}
{"text":"This Mr. Greek location either will lead you to quick-relief food poisoning or food poisoning that will last many days. The reason: an extremely cheap owner/manager that doesn't believe in fresh ingredients. The vegetables are rarely fresh and sometimes days old. If you're a vegetarian, and you order vegetable souvlaki, it is unfortunate , as most likely the veggies will be extremely old. My entire family was sick for days last time. 

They are very cheap on portions here as well. Not recommended."}

{"text":"I went here 15 years ago and don't remember being so bad like others said in the reviews. So I went to give a try, and I can verify the reviews were all correct. The restaurant is big and we were taken to be seated in a corner table that our server didn't see us. I went out to order the dishes then he started to notice he got customers. After that I wanted to ask him something regarding our order, as he never showed up again, I went out couple times to talk to him. Then finally the dishes arrived, the food was alright like other locations. Again, when we wanted to pay the bill, we had to go out to find our sever. It was harder than self served as we had to go out to look for the server or being ignored forever. Will never go back ever."}
