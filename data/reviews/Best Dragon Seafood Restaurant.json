{"text":"Service is terrible. Staff extremely rude. Made this yelp account just to write this review; a testament to how I feel about my negative experience here.  Came here around 2:15 pm, the restaurant was almost empty, which is understandable given that it's an awkward time.  However, with it not being busy... one would expect better attentive service.  Nope.   Instead, what we got were incredibly rude, condescending, surly servers who really don't understand how to answer simple questions in a polite manner.   We had ordered soup as one of our items, with the intention of getting it as an appetizer. However, after getting/eating almost all of our entire meal and still not getting the soup (this being after repeatedly asking when it was coming)... I called over the server (who was an older female) once again for clarification, because we were pretty much done our meal by then. She was incredibly rude and instead of giving me a clear answer she walked away from us... right while I was talking to her.  So, I called over ANOTHER server, who I then explained the problem to and he seemed to pretend to not understand that an appetizer comes at the beginning of the meal. I stated that I wanted to cancel the item of which he then said okay.  However, five minutes later the female server returns with the soup... I then try to explain to her that I cancelled the item. The male server is looking straight at us, not saying anything... (I don't know if they were trying to make us take it because it was already made or...). She then walks away AGAIN, while I am talking to her. I can hear her badmouthing us with her coworkers in the background.  In addition to that, they also forgot one of our other items that we ordered. I mean c'mon... the restaurant was empty for goodness sakes, it was dead aka not busy.   All in all. Food was mediocre. Service was absolutely terrible -- I, along with my family, will make sure to never go here again."}
{"text":"Was trying to look for a dim sum place around yonge steels and I will not come back this place, the foods are cold, not fresh and not many selection! There are many Chinese restaurants offer much better dim sum than this."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT EVER. Still at the restaurant. Horrible service.. No flow of food.. Waited soooo long for each dish. The main came out first and rice was last... Like wtf..they ruined our Christmas dinner.. Just horrible.. Made us so aggravated and annoyed.."}
{"text":"I used to go here almost every weekend.  really good food, lots of dim sum options and it is very fast service.  unfortunately I went to the washroom, and saw someone from the kitchen use the washroom and not wash their hands, so not going back."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a craving for dim sum and unfortunately this place turned out to be a disappointment. Wouldn't recommend it if that's what you're coming in for, the dim sum menu was small, not of much variety and not good taste wise."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to all the time for dim sum, not only because the location is easy to bus/drive to, the service is always exceptional. The staff is friendly and the dim sum is really good compared to other medium-sized restaurants.  I also went to Best Dragon for dinner. I came with a big group of people so we ordered the set menu, which includes the Giant Lobster special, which is the best lobster I've ever eaten (I probably can't go back to small lobsters after this giant fellow) Peking Duck, Chinese vegetables, soup and many more.  Best Dragon is definitely a hidden gem in York Region. Again, I cannot emphasize enough about the Giant Lobster!!! It is the best seafood dish I have tried!"}
{"text":"Sometimes dim sum looks different but everything ends up tasting the same but not in this case.  I've had dim sum here many times and the quality and service is consistently good.  This style is literally a la cart instead of off menu, a la carte.  You can if you wish but the carts are more fun and is the traditional way dim sum is served.  Quality and flavor rank high in my books here.  When in the Steeles Bathurst area, this is a definite lunch stop for me."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a few years, mainly for dim sum on the weekends.  The staff is very warm and helpful and have gotten to know us -- to the point that certain carts tend to start at our table when we are there.  This is our all-time favourite place to go to for dim sum.  Our favourite dish is the chive and shrimp, pan-fried pancakes - hands down one of the best dim sum dishes we've ever eaten, we always get extra to take home.  We've also eaten dinner here a few times.  The dishes are full of flavour and the Yeung Chow Fried rice is amazing.  The lobster is fresh and the cooks really know how to cook it well."}
{"text":"I first knew this place as furama years and years ago. To this day, my family still calls it that even though it has changed names 2/3x. I assumed they changed owners when the names changed but they must have kept the same workers--at least in the kitchen because the food has always tasted the same to us and has been consistently good. It's right next to our church and was our go-to for special occasions esp when that particular celebration was on a Sunday. I don't live in Toronto anymore but I try to make it here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years to celebrate holidays and birthdays. The set dinners for large groups are great.  The food is always well prepared, consistent and very filling. This place offers good authentic food for reasonable prices. They have their regular menu and a combination menu (I like ordering from this one) try the beef tenderloin in black pepper sauce, I order this every time, haha! or the cashew beef. Deep fried squid or even the pork chops. You won't be disappointed!  Note: their staff is also very friendly and warm"}
{"text":"A medium-sized restaurant in a crowded mall, Best Dragon is bright, pleasant and clean.  There's a reasonable selection of dim sum going around on carts.  The carts don't pass as quickly as they would in a larger place with more customers, but they came quickly enough to satisfy our table, and the food that came on them was hot and of good quality.  The pricing was higher than the cheaper places in chinatown, but not as expensive as some of the upscale dim sum restaurants.  Basically, it was solid dim sum without standing out in any particular way, and I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Despite this place being overpriced, I do think it is okay for the area.   However, a few weeks ago I went in on a Friday morning maybe before 10:45am. I knew they had weekday morning specials before 11:30am for their dim sum (Their small, medium and large dishes for the price of a small: $2.80 each when you pay by cash). When I received the bill, they charged me full price for everything. I thought to myself, \"Oh my, I must have not looked at the menu correctly, and the special must only be from Monday to Thursday!\" At this point, they had already removed the pricing sheet from me. I asked the waitress about it as I was paying, and she acted as if she didn't understand a word of English, so I just paid it thinking I was in the wrong. Keep in my mind my bill that should have been less than $30, turned out to be more than $50 as I left a good tip. I now know that she was a lying scumbag as I just went in last week and I saw that the special was indeed valid on Fridays.  There is a sweet old lady who always delivers the food. However, the majority of the wait staff have always been pretty snobby.  I will unfortunately never be returning back here."}
{"text":"There's a shortage of traditional Chinese restaurants in the area. Best Dragon fills that gap nicely, but it's far from a winner in my books.   The only pro I can think of is that the quality of the food is good. It's not the best, but it's good. On average, the food doesn't seem to be swimming in oil/msg. It's nice to be able to get decent dim sum near my house. The next closest \"traditional\" place we're willing to travel to is Landmark at Victoria Park/McNicoil which is a 20 minute difference.   On the downside, there are quite a few strikes against. My biggest problem is the price. Everything is 10-30% more expensive than a typical place. I also find the menu selection smaller compared to other Chinese places. The menu also seems dumbed down to suit foreigners. It doesn't have some of the things I'd expect from a traditional restaurant. And this leads to my next negative point about the place...  There's something off about this place. Every time we come, it seems at least half the customers are not Chinese. Of course, I'm not against that. It's just feels a little strange when we're given those large plates instead of \"cup plates\". The large plates are for people who want to eat with plates instead of the traditional palm sized bowls. There's English everywhere and they even put pictures so the foreigners don't have to guess what they're ordering. So while the food is authentic, the atmosphere is not. While this is a negative to me, it could easily for a positive to some of you readers.   These are not major flaws and we still give Best Dragon consideration each time we want to eat out. I find that the only times we go is when time is of the essence. A lot of times, we're willing to drive the 25-30 minutes necessary to get to Markham whenever we want something more traditional, with greater selection and most importantly, at a more reasonable price. If we want a level below \"traditional\", there's always Congee Time on Yonge/Drewry which has really reasonable prices. So we find that we rarely come to Best Dragon at all.  P.S. A lot of people here are complaining about the service. This is more about culture shock than an actual flaw. Most Chinese people don't care too much about service as long as they get seated within reasonable time. Servers are not required to be nice. They are just expected to take orders and bring you food."}
{"text":"Best Dragon has now nudged itself into my heart, securing the place for top Dim Sum restaurant. Service is excellent for those of the NEAPs* like me who've often had to brace ignoring servers, absent communication or missing dishes for some decent authentic Chinese food. This practice just doesn't occur at BDSR.    On weekday mornings, specifically from 10-11:30, all S,M, and L sized dishes are $2.30, otherwise standard price for just the small size. I wish there were a little more options for veggie dishes aside from steamed bok choy. The service is excellent and they always have the cart ladies walking around, opening lids for your viewing pleasure. Condiments are consistently replenished and empty plates are promptly taken away.    BDSR is always a lot cleaner than the standard dim sum joint, and it's often busy around lunch time.   5 Stars for excellent service, 4 for cleanliness and 3 for quality food.  ---------- *Non-East Asian Patrons"}
{"text":"I visit often from San Francisco, where we have a decent China town with delicious dim sum. I was surprised to find that Best Dragon Seafood is my new fav place. The selection is soo great and the quality is top notch and oh so delicious.   The fam comes here on a regular basis so they know them well. What does this mean? We get GREAT service..   If you're coming on the weekend there may be a wait. The restaurant gets very busy.   You'll definitely see me here on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Well the place looked liked furans but it didn't taste like it.It tasted like dragons breath not best.Generally all the dim sum fitted into one category-awful.Everything was tasteless and glutinous.Remind me to either go to rol san downtown or spring villa and skyview fusion uptown."}
{"text":"Here is a hidden gem for people visiting or are in the Toronto area. I went to a dozen of Chinese restaurants over the last week and this was by far the best one. The place was never full, although we were there a bit early (5pm) but I suspect that the far off location is probably the main reason.  My favorite dish was the Honey Garlic Short Ribs (beef). I think I hogged 3x my portion and left the veggies to the others :). Some other popular dishes were the pork short ribs and the Peking duck. We didn't try the seafood but apparently the lobster is amazing."}
{"text":"I go to sky dragon for dim sum on an occasional basis; they have a great deal where if you go on weekdays and order before 11:30AM, they treat S/M/L dishes as the price of small which is great.  There is a good selection of options for dim sum at the restaurant, and it is catered to you if you don't eat pork. Most Chinese dim sum uses pork in their dishes, but at sky dragon, they use chicken instead, which is great."}
{"text":"The food is good. Nothing wrong with that at all. But we had a dispute with the bill and they were not willing to accommodate at all. Basically my mom ordered a combo type package but she was up-sold on a dish or two. One dish she was upsold didn't qualify for the combo. At the end of the day we had a bill about double what we expected. My mom is a very innocent and easily tricked person. She complained that she was mislead. In the end after much discussion, we just paid the bill in full. Not a bad attitude from management but they were not willing to admit any wrong or even throw her a bone. We left there feeling I satisfied and ripped off. Real pity because the food was ok but this simple dispute / misunderstanding will make me never recommend a place like this."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been through a few different owners or head chefs, and even a name change, but I still keep coming back.  Dim sum is very good. Lots of choices, always hot, always coming around, and very affordable.   As for the dinner menu, their lobsters, soft shell crab, and deep fried shrimp are as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This is the closest dim sum, and once in a while we pop here for lunch. The strange thing is that every 2-3 years they announce that they are changing owners/management/decor and then only the name changes but everything else (food, menu and servers included) stays the same, reminds me of Brooklyn's everyday \"going out of business\" sale trick. Anyway, the dim sum is constantly good, the selection from the carts is ok but not too extensive, you can order items you don't see and there is a dinner menu from which to choose mains. We tried their Peking duck, nothing special, though good for inexperienced. I keep having trouble with their Hot and Sour soup which is one of my favourites, but it either comes out devilishly spicy (i mean that) or not spicy enough, so try to specify to the server how you want it. The service is friendly but don't expect things to happen on their own, if you want something, flag the waiter down. I always see people eating crabs, but I have never tried them myself (usually there is no room after dim sums), however them seem to be quite popular, so give it a try if you like crabs."}
{"text":"Went here for a catered event on a Sunday evening.  Place started off empty (when we got there at 5:00pm) and was packed by the time we were leaving at 8:00pm.    I'm not sure of the exact names of the dishes we got but it was A LOT of food, i had to be rolled to the car.  From what i remember: Sweet & sour pork (was probably my favourite dish), lobster, chicken, mushrooms/bok choy mix, mushrooms/tofu mix (tofu was really good), marinated beef and broccoli, fried spicy fish sticks, red bean soup (looked weird but tasted amazing, kind of like melted red bean icecream), and much more than I can remember.  Service was also great, refilled water and brought everything we asked for quickly."}
{"text":"Okay I gave this a second chance again after 5 years.  It had really gone down hill to the point I have to give it a one-star.  I don't think I will ever come here again.  The service hasn't improved and their staff (though friendly) only speaks Chinese making things a bit more difficult.  Surprisingly there are a few Caucasian seniors so maybe they're just regulars.  There's not much people there at lunch time which I guess should be a warning already for me.  However, I was craving dim sum stuff so tried it out.  The food itself is so blah and laden it MSG, I dozed off for a few minutes when it kicked in at work.  My tongue is still numb as I write this review.  The food when we picked it off the cart was probably sitting there for a while too which attributed to the poor experience.  Next time I will try Legend Asian Cuisine instead even if it is a bit more north,"}
