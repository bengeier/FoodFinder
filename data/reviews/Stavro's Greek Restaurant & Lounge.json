{"text":"I love trying new restaurants - this one is excellent.  Love the chicken souvlaki - everything is fresh and flavourful.  Super friendly staff - excellent customer service.  We have been back  several times.  Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just opened in Streetsville. The food is fresh and delicious and the service is friendly and welcoming. You got to eat here."}
{"text":"We went here after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The food was good and the service was friendly and fast.    Was it the best Greek food I've ever had?  No but it was pretty good and the portion was generous.  So if you are looking for something fast and tasty give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food. Good portion. Nice quaint restaurant and good service. The chicken was tender and juicy and the lamb was good.  Salad was big and rice portion was a good size too."}
{"text":"Tucked away at the corner of Pearl St in Streetsville, I am so happy my friend suggested we eat here!  The souvlaki dinner is HUGE and more than enough to share between 2 people. It comes with the usual rice, potatoes, salad, chicken pieces and tzatiki sauce. Everything is fresh and very tasty.   I got 2 chicken souvlaki sandwiches for my brothers and they loved it. The sandwich comes with fries INSIDE THE SANDWICH!! I've been saying that fries in sandwiches are the wave but nobody listens to lil ol' me.. Stavros keep doin what you're doin!  This review is short 1 star from 5 stars because we waited quite a while to get our food- but I suppose it because the chicken takes a while to grill?"}
{"text":"Good rice and potatoes. Spanakopita can be a hit or a miss . Sometimes perfect....sometimes dry...sometimes over cooked (reheated)  Tried all their meats. From pork, chicken and beef. Pork and beef mostly are served dry. Chicken is the most consistent.   I come hear with a few friends once in awhile after some drinks as it's definitely good value and hits the spot so that's why the 3 stars.   Getting more and more inconsistent. Feta quality is getting cheaper and meats are always dry. Rice is way over soaked in butter"}
{"text":"A little oily for my taste and not exactly authentic but satisfied my craving for Greek food"}
{"text":"A great addition to Streetsville neighborhood. Delicious food, generous portion, descent price. It is a family run restaurant that is warm, clean and homey. You can find plenty of parking at the public lot next to the building. I tried greek bifteki and it was so good. Their hot sauce is a real kicker."}
{"text":"Ordered for a party of 14 and the portion was great! Salad was presented beautifully, pork wasn't dry, rice was different from your typical long grain almost tasted like fried rice but it was good, tzitki was to die for! The only thing I was surprised was the size of the potatoes I felt it should've been cut smaller especially it was for a party (potatoes was served whole it looked kinda rude on a plate so I had to cut them in 1/4's, also half of the sauce spilled in my car seat maybe should've been packed better). But overall I would recommend and will return-the service & taste of food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. Had the spanakopita for my appetizer and it was the best I've ever had. My entree was the chicken gyro. It was seasoned well and tzatziki complements it. Wish I got the fries as a combo. Service was awesome ... really nice folks. Will come back next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Y'all need to go here NOW!!!!  The staff are amazing. The prices are reasonable. The portions of food are generous. The food is uhhhhmazing. ORDER THE LAMB CHOPS!!!! GO! NOW!!!"}
{"text":"The calamari is not over battered, clearly breaded in house, and served with a creamy sauce that packs a nice wee kick. The Greek cheese, though slightly overcooked, was so good. Proper meal for less than 30 dollars. I look forward to coming back for their meat plates."}
{"text":"Ordered the souvlaki dinner and wasn't impressed like I was with the calamari and gyro wrap :(.."}
{"text":"ATTN YELPERS BEWARE - ZERO STAR  I don't usually like to write reviews like this but im sorry I cant keep quiet about what happened this past Sunday.  Stavro's is on the skip the dishes app.  Was quite excited as a small group of us were all craving Greek food.  None of us had tried this place before and were all excited to try it especially knowing how hard it is to get Greek food delivered.  We placed the order on skip the dishes.  There were 6 of us so we ordered 6 different meals.  The order process went smooth and the delivery went smooth.  Once the driver left we realized that we only received 4 out of the 6 meals and were missing 2 meals along with all the taziki sauce, pita's and all the cutlery.  No quite upset yet knowing accidents happen.  We picked up the phone and called Stavro's and let them know of the situation.  Immediately they became defensive and argued that they sent the whole order with the driver.  We gave them the benefit if the doubt at first and began to think that the driver possibly forgot a bag.  As the person on the phone continued being defensive they then accused the driver of eating the food.  That was just INSANE the fact that they accused the poor driver of eating the food.  First mistake Stavros should have been aiming to please their customer and helping us out as we now had 2 people with out food.  As the conversation became heated they got more and more defensive and demanded that if we wanted the food we had to go pick it up.  We had all been drinking and should not have been driving.  We told them this and were not concerned and did not care.  While speaking with them were on the phone with skip the dishes as well who were very helpful of the situation and were ready and willing to help.  They too called the restaurant and were given attitude and were accused of their driver of eating the food.  In the end we were frustrated and no longer wanted the food and would be happy with a credit.  In the end we were NOT given a credit and were NOT given the food.  We were told to go in the next day and pick up the missed food.  That did not fix the problem at hand where 2 of us had NOTHING TO EAT.  We had to suck up the fact that we paid for food we didst get and that Stavros had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever experienced in all my restaurants history.  Restaurants like these should not be allowed to serve the public.  Seeing as I am a frequent restaurant goer I REFUSE to go any where near this place after how we were treated.    A clear message to Stavro's restaurant.  CUSTOMER SERVICE is a huge part of the restaurant business you may need to freshen up on those skills if you want to keep people happy.   Here is the better part.  The food that was received was actually not bad and Stavro's probably would have gained a new and regular customer."}
{"text":"on food alone 5 total food orgasm. everyrhinh was incredible my bf and i orderrf a plate and pita  the chicken was so tender and marinated extremely well.  too bad i live in toronto... this was better than any greek place on the danforth which is torontos greektown."}
{"text":"Looking for a place that serves up decent Greek chow at affordable prices?   Stavro's could be a place that you can check out.  Tucked away in Streetsville lies this small mom and pop restaurant.  We came for dinner on a Friday night and found the place to be hustling with patrons getting take out and dining in.  First impressions?  Busy, cozy, clean and smelled nice. Yep. Sniff test. We all do it.  They were able to immediately accommodate a 7 person dine in party.  Not to shabby for such a small place.  Did I mention kid friendly?  Yes, they didn't seem to mind my two year old daughter tearing up the place. Lol. JK.   I ordered a Pork Souvlaki Platter and got to taste the Calamari and Chicken Wings. Who orders chicken wings at a Greek restaurant?!   Haha. My 9 year old that's who!   The Souvlaki. Very good marinade. Very delicious. Yummy for my tummy! The Greek Salad that came with the platter was super fresh and dressed perfectly.   The only downfall of the dish, imo, was the potatoes.  They were meh!   The rice was nice. The platter in whole was enough to feed two people. Quantity people!   The Calamari was deep fried. Tender with a light crispy coating.  Not bad at all. The dipping sauce complimented the calamari very nicely.  Would definitely order that again. The deep fried Chicken Wings were alright.  Did I mention the Hot Sauce?  It had a sneaky kick to it. Flavourful too. I put that s---! on everything.  I don't know if they normally do this but they brought all our food to our table. Nice touch.  We did have to order and pay at the cash but that wasn't an issue.   I had no problems with the ordering of drinks. Yes!  They are licensed!  Wooohooo!   Minimal beer and hard liquor selection. What they had sure worked for me and my dining companions. They even allowed our party to run a tab!!   Staff was friendly and very courteous. Felt welcomed and well attended to.    No worries about parking here either. They have a small parking lot but don't fear, there is plenty of free street parking.    Now comes what you have all been waiting for:  The complaints section of my review.  We did have some minor problems with our plates arriving in a timely manner.  My fellow dining partners could not handle the suspense and ended up speaking to the staff. They in turn got the outstanding dishes to our table.  Potatoes meh!   The background music was on a loop so we heard the same Bouzouki melody played about 6 times during the course of our meal. I honestly felt like getting up and smashing plates on the floor!  Calm, peace and serenity.  Lol.  Anyhow, I hope this review was helpful. Opa!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place in streetsville. Finally a place that competes with Osmows. Get the chicken souvlaki plate."}
{"text":"Omg, what a wonderful experience my boyfriend and I had here.  Shout out to Raphael for being so lovely and friendly, making our experience even better.  Service really makes all the difference.  We found out about this place through a flyer that was left on my friend's car lol.  That advertising actually worked!  We were checking out the Bread and Honey festival, so we decided to have dinner here first.  Located on Pearl street, there is a free parking lot located right beside the restaurant.  Very convenient!  When you walk in you are greeted with the sound of Greek music and of course the friendly workers.   There were quite a few people in there already waiting for their orders. I placed my order and Raphael (I hope I'm spelling that right) even complimented me on my pronunciation (heh heh heh, *BRAGS*).  He also asked my boyfriend if he was Greek and then they started chatting it up in Greek.  That was cute.  After we placed our order we took a seat.  The food took about 10 -15 minutes to come out, which we didn't mind at all.  It's all made to order and if you want something fresh and authentic, you're gonna have to wait a bit.  I ordered a chicken gyro and my boyfriend ordered a chicken souvlaki gyro.We also ordered a spanakopita to share.  I had asked for just a glass of water and Raphael let me take a bottled one free of charge. *cries, thank you!!  My boyfriend and I agreed the gyros were very delicious, fresh and in a way \"light''.  We for sure did not feel like crap after but we were defs full.  Their gyros are less greasy than other places and I think that's why it felt so good eating it.  The chicken was super juicy and their tzatziki was amazing!  Probably the best I ever had.  Super fresh and not overly garlic-y.  I hate when places do that to their tzatziki.  All the ingredients worked well together.  My boyfriend even spread some of the tzatziki all over the spanakopita and said it made it even better.  My only wish is that the spanakopita be a little more hotter.  It was more like room temperature by the time we got it but of course tasty!    I really wanted to try one of their desserts and if it were up to me, I would've had all three, but my stomach could only handle one.  I really wanted to try the Greek yogurt cake, so I asked if they still had any.  They sure did!  And this was also on the house!! *cries again** omg thank you guys so much!!  They were so nice, I could not even handle it.  The cake was delicious, it was basically a cheesecake aka my favourite KIND of cake!    We made sure to leave a hefty tip because this place defs deserves it!!  I hope they do really well.  We plan on coming back more times this summer.  Oh and they're open super late too.  Convenient!!  Bougatsa, I'm coming for you!!"}
{"text":"Been a regular customer but lately they have been cheapening out on their meat and sauces. Only reason I liked them in the first place was cause of their portions. Now it's just another stingy restaurant with overpriced food."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars. Best Greek restaurant that we've been to in a while. Authentic and very tasty. Everything was delicious. I'd have given it 5 stars except that the service was a bit slow. Calamari was hot and delicious. The Chicken Gyro was authentic and very tasty. Greek salad was good my wife said that the rice was great. I thought that the potatoes lacked seasoning but they were definitely good but not great. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I found this little gem by accident.  Decided to give it a try.  The food is as good as home cooked by YiaYia.  The space is small with a take-out feel, but the food is anything but fast-food.  Service was friendly and attentive.  We will definitely be back.  The calamari was great.  Super fresh, perfectly breaded.  Tzatziki is authentic and delicious.  We had gyros which were great. Can't really get that wrong.  We were full, but had to take some baklava home for later.  There are no words in my vocabulary to describe how good it was.  Best we've ever had.    I highly recommend giving this spot a try."}
{"text":"I tried this recently opened Greek restaurant in Streetsville with my family last week. I was excited to try it after seeing online articles about it and despite some good things about it, there are also a few things that need to be worked on.  PROS: - Plenty of free parking in the lot right beside the restaurant - Cute blue and white theme on the exterior and interior of the restaurant along with pictures of places in Greece that reminded us of our vacation there - Many food options to choose from - Prices were reasonable for most items such as the gyros sandwich combo for about $7 - Good portion sizes for items such as the gyros sandwich combo that my mom and husband got, my chicken souvlaki meal, as well as my dad's fish platter - Easy to find seats on a Sunday for lunch - Delicious tzaziki sauce that came with my chicken souvlaki meal and in my husband's gyros sandwich! - Decent tasting gyros sandwich, fries, chicken souvlaki and fish but it didn't wow me   ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: - Staff need to get better at knowing the menu and being able to recommend food items to customers. - Cafeteria style paying is fine but when you pay for your meal before getting it and are already prompted to give a tip on the machine before any service has really been given, it's a sore spot for me. - Not sure if they were short staffed but someone literally came to take the order and we didn't see them again until she came to collect the plates when we were done. It was not a busy day in this restaurant by the way since there were only 3 families dining. - The portion size of the fried calamari was about a dozen small pieces and it wasn't crispy enough - The Greek salad that came with my chicken souvlaki meal was fresh but bland - The taste of their dishes overall could still be improved  Basically, the most memorable part of the dining experience was the tzaziki sauce and I would come back to try another meal that came with that amazing sauce BUT it would likely be for take out. I don't think I'd ever dine in again here unfortunately. I might also come back for the gyros combo since it was a good deal and came with tzaziki sauce in it.   I understand that new places need time to work out their kinks but this place needs to keep improving fast to keep up with the many other options in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came here twice.  Food was fresh and portions were generous, staff is very friendly.  Had chicken souvlaki dinner both times and was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Very good and tasty Greek food. Came in for dinner and was greeted warmly. I had chicken souvlaki, my colleagues had pork souvlaki and a gyro. It was all excellent. They give you a ton of food as well. Will return"}
{"text":"We have eaten there a least 15 time. I always get the chicken dinner. Always made to order and super fresh. Service is always good given that we always have very complicated salad orders."}
{"text":"Location: The new restaurant is located in the heart of downtown streetsville. Prior to this, a lot of restaurants only lasted ~ 6 months. There were just so many changes that I just couldn't keep track of so I wonder how long this restaurant will last. Private parking is available beside the restaurant, but it is quite small and limited as it is shared between nearby restaurants. However, street parking or paid parking lots are always available.   Atmosphere: I came here with 4 other girlfriends and 2 babies (3 months and 1 year old) on a weekday at 2pm for a late lunch. When I got there, there were maybe 2 other tables finishing up their lunch. There was 1 waitress who was cleaning the tables AND serving and a chef cooking. The place is cozy, small and quiet. There are several large tables in the back with booth seatings and some 4-people tables at the front. The restaurant is pretty clean I would say.   Food:  Since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the Gyro sandwich ($5.99) and you can always make it a combo (+fries and can pop) for $6.99. My friends ordered several souvlaki dinner plates: veggie plate, chicken plate, beef salad. All entrees come with a side of rice and greek salad. The Gyro sandwich was alright. There wasn't a lot of meat to fill the bread so it looked quite small. Kind of disappointing.   There are plenty of Greek restaurants in Mississauga, so I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek in a casual setting. Freshly cooked food and very generous portions (the dinner plates can actually feed two people) Two people can dine here easily for $30 including taxes and tips :) There is also lots of free parking outside of the restaurant as well. The food here is definitely better than the franchised restaurants everyone thinks of when deciding on Greek food"}
{"text":"First time attending this premise. The food is fresh and very tasty. The staff are very nice and take our service was very quick. My order was two pork souvlaki wraps, a Greek salad and a side of rice. I was not disappointed with anything. The pita for the wrap is different then most restaurants and it was very flavourful. I will be back again. Beautifully decorated new premise. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"A strong 3.5 ... probably best casual option in Streetsville.  Thoughtful owners give this a heads above your average place.  This quaint fast casual restaurant is new to Streetsville and it's a welcomed addition.  It's a super clean and bright spot with cute Aegean focused decoration.  Lots of seating available here and a few tables outside as well.    It's clear this is a family run place and the owners run the restaurant.  A lovely lady took our order at the counter and you can immediately two people in the back are constantly making the food fresh.  I emphasize the word FRESH... nothing here is premade (except the salad items are pre cut but nothing looks old or wilted).  We ordered an appetizer of calamari and a vegetarian plate for lunch.  We had a bit from across the street already so we're just getting some good hot food.  We sat down and noticed how clean all the tables were... much care goes into this place so kudos to them.  Our order did take a bit longer for a counter place but to be fair, when you ate your first bite, you can see why.  Nothing tasted pre-cooked.    Calamari was star of the meal.... hot from the fryer, well seasoned, lightly battered, and well cooked.  This was quite good.  It's even better if you match it with their in house made hot sauce.  It has a good kick and nice flavour.  4/5  Vegetarian platter was enormous amount of food and well cooked.  Boiled potatoes were soft and generous portion.  It was boiled with lemon so it had an interesting flavour.  I felt like we were given 2 of them!  The salad was not overdressed but mostly consisting of iceberg lettuce with some tomato slices and a few black olives.  A large full 1 cup of rice was also given.  And we got several freshly fried falafels.  Aside from the falafels which were hot from the fryer, well cooked, and seasoned... the rest of the vegetarian platter was filler.  There was a lot of it and maybe people do enjoy that but I would rather have smaller amounts of more interesting vegetarian options instead of boiled potatoes, a cup of white rice, and iceberg lettuce.  3/5 for the platter overall  This is a good option if you're in Streetsville... I wish the owners much love and luck."}
{"text":"This is it. Fresh.  Authentic.  And hot.  Great value and price.  Great portions.  Why bother with franchise junk when there is this around??? Win!!!"}
