{"text":"What makes a really goog neighborhood joint? For me it's not just quality cooking and decent prices- it's the sense of being welcomed and appreciated.  I have been dropping by for lunch three or four days a month often with a friend since the current owners remodeled the former Tokyo Sushi opposite  St, Paul's Chuch (where Tafelmusik plays).  The food decor and atmosphere have stepped up greatly. I have tried many items but my fave is the Chef Combi with salmon teriyaki and sushi. it includes generous sashimi as well. Many veggie items too.  Only a light dinner needed after such a feast.  No friend has ever disliked Maido and my friends are  Mostly picky foodies.   Anyway, it's my kind of low-key friendly place, give it a try."}
{"text":"Seems to be a family run business - very friendly and the food is excellent. Unlike some of the sushi joints along Bloor St this place doesn't try to overwhelm with quantity - instead they have excellent quality and attention to the small details of what makes great meal."}
{"text":"Great for the price!  Good service, good fresh fish and good location- one can't ask for much more in a sushi restaurant. Given the abundance of sushi places in the annex, this one stands out as being a simple and nice place with decent offerings. The sashimi- sushi combo platter was my favorite. The salmon sashimi practically melts in your mouth. Will go there again."}
{"text":"The staff were all very friendly and polite. For the price the sushi was great! We got one of the Bento Box Specials, several options to choose from for only $5.99. We also tried the Kimchi rolls which were amazing. I would recommend it, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good services, good quality food. I would give it a five star if the portion is as big as other similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst sushi I have ever had and the prices were outrageously high. A $16 combo sushi set on the menu magically increased to $19 and all rolls like dragon were $12 or more where most places they are around $8 or $9. The sushi pizza was hard as a rock and not cut and the rice was super stale. The tuna was really fishy. My boyfriend wouldn't even eat any of it. I hope the stuff I tried doesn't make me sick. Honestly I never write reviews and it was so bad I felt compelled to warn people."}
{"text":"Based on weekday lunch special.  Decor/atmosphere, place is okay.  Nothing special, there are booths for small groups.  There isn't much in terms of seating though (I imagine roughly 25 people can be seated).  Food, I ordered the salmon teriyaki and the food was good.  Nothing special, and you get what you pay for.  The portion size is decent for the salmon and rice but the salad was actually a lot larger than I expected.  The miso soup that was included was nice and hot.  Service, no issues here.  Seated quickly, server came to take my order, came by when I was done and asked how things were.  Cost, for $6, you get a variety of choices for your meal which will come with soup & salad or vegetable tempura (various teriyaki like chicken or salmon, and a few roll options).  It is a good deal, although all sushi shops in the are are roughly the same price.  Down the street at Sakura, for $1 more, you get 2 gyoza, and a california roll.  No problems with the place, but this is based on my lunch experience.  At other things it may differ.  I wouldn't say don't come, but all the sushi in the area tastes very similar to me."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Must try the zabu soba and the ginjou sake. Also: huge fat fresh maki rolls! What a change from all you can eat!"}
{"text":"I got the California rolls and white tuna rolls. California rolls were below average but the white tuna is amazing here!  It's my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised with my complementary Edamame! Definitely will be back to try their other fish but never again will I get the California rolls. There's probably a reason why they're only $4 for 6 pieces. I'd rather pay an extra dollar for divine white tuna!"}
{"text":"Charming spot near my apartment.  Having tried both Sushi on Bloor and New Generation in the area, I decided to give this place a try.  I ordered chef's choice as it features what's fresh for the day.  For the start they offer complementary edamame, miso soup and salad.  I'm never really into salad but their salad is well prepared.  As for the entree I initially thought it features 10 different type of fish but instead it only includes 5 types with two each.  The price seems to be stiff but decent Japanese food is never cheap.  The waitress recommended that I finish first 8 first and they'll deliver unagi at the end because of its sweet taste.  For its price, the fish is quite fresh and I especially enjoys yellowtail.  Unagi is presented like dessert and chef has put some thoughts into the plating.  During the interval the waitress would stop by filling up the water or ask how is everything.  I think they did better in term of customer service and interacting with patrons in comparison to two popular sushi spots in the neighbourhood.  But portion tends to be small comparing to the neighbouring spots.  I also see other table ordering lunch special but I'm never too crazy about bento or Japanese noodle.  Overall good experience but nothing too different or distinct among the area."}
{"text":"I live close by and often come by for the dinner bento box with salmon and cali rolls. It's always a peaceful atmosphere, friendly staff. Food always tastes fresh, and you get a good portion for the price.   I've been to sushi on bloor down the street, and it was terrible (overly busy, rude customer service). Maido is a gem, folks.   Only thing I'd like to see is maybe a bit of an upgrade to the interior, more comfortable booth seating cushions, stuff like that. Not a big deal, since I thoroughly enjoy the food and people.  :)"}
{"text":"Im a regular and just wanna say this place is fantastic. I always get the special and enjoy the service very much. The food is great and the service is onpoint. Often times they treat me to edamame and oranges which definetly helps!  Overall reccomending going atleast once. You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials price is unbeatable. Both 5.99 combo for miso soup, a nice salad,  and select choice of meat and rice, and 6.99 combo for 2 kinds of sushi with miso soup are delicious. I would recommend student to order here instead of expensive meal plans. The service is quite nice and quick."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was really cheap! Their yam fries were probably the best thing I've had in a while, I love sweet potato fries so this was a pleasure. My friend got a teriyaki bento and she said it was good, similar to many places but its definitely not bad. I got a sweet roll which said was 4 priced but dang, that 4 pieces were huge and filled me up quick.   The atmosphere was also really nice, sweating arrangemeny is small so be weary for larger groups when its busy. And the waitress was really helpful.  I'm only giving 4 stars because we were the only ones there so of course everything was quick, I'm just not sure how quick it is on busier hours?"}
{"text":"Solid tasty food, at great prices, and with decent portions.  As a life-long vegetarian, there isn't a lot on the menu I can eat, but navigating what had bonito and what didn't was a good experience with the waitress we had. The miso and agedashi tofu, for instance, are both made with bonito - in the soup for the first, and in the sauce for the second. I ended up getting their salad dressing, which is delicious, on the side of my \"no bonito\" agedashi tofu - and it was perfect. The avocado roll was utilitarian and filling.  My pescatarian friend got a bento dinner and it was large enough he thought he might not be able to finish it, but tasty enough that he did. He got the salmon with California roll.  When I visit him again it's definitely going to be my go-to for sushi!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't know the people here but I love them. I have never eaten here but I am glad that I did.   If you're hesitating on Bloor street and can't decide between the sea of sushi houses, come here, you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant has a professional look and feel, kind of unassuming but well worth the trip.  As you enter, you are greeted immediately by your warm and friendly waitress. You can sit anywhere you want.  The tables are small but we were a party of 4. This is a very family friendly restaurant.   We ordered the teriyaki chicken, California rolls, and udon noodles. No one left there hungry, we had some of the best Japanese salad dressing that we have ever tasted. The miso soup was hot! The California rolls were made fresh to order. The teriyaki chicken was all sorts of yum. The cold drinks were served in cold glasses. The salad was served in cold bowls. What attention to detail!  Be careful of the bathrooms, the locks stick.  Our waitress was was one of two or three and she never left us, she served us our entire meal.  After our meal, we weren't rushed out with the bill, we were allowed to sit and talk; how often does that happen!  The decor was nice and quaint, the staff were attentive and friendly, you are not rushed, prices are moderate, food was good and hot. The cold dishes are served in cold dishes.  I'm coming back, keep my seat warm and my drinking glass cold!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new sushi restaurant in the Annex and Maido kept appearing on Yelp.  The menu offers pretty much the entire spectrum of Japanese food. We ordered a spicy tuna roll and a bento box (beef teriyaki).  With the beef teriyaki, you can actually choose the doneness in which I chose medium rare. The food came out quickly and beef was cooked to my specifications. The server was polite and always came at the perfect time to refill our tea. Will be back here again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and in those few times we always receive something in house. Edamame. The food is extremely average but fresh. Polite servers. Probably the best \"Japanese\" restaurant in the area if you count out Kinka."}
{"text":"Been here twice now for lunch.  Portion is decent and price is good if you order the special lunch menu.  I was disappointed the first time they never gave/told us about the special menu until we saw the table beside us with it.  It was too late already as we ordered.  Second time we went the staff provided us the special menu without asking so I am not sure that is.  Place is pretty small and could get busy quick.  Servers are friendly and attentive. First time I was there I got the chicken teriyaki bento and 2nd time I went I got the Maki special (Spicy Salmon and Futo roll)."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. This place is a sham. If you like Japanese food then do not go to this place. I tried them on a whim because no where else was open and boy did I pay for it. Soft mushy rice squished together chicken teriyaki with some extra sweet sauce poured on top. Stay away of you have functional taste buds."}
{"text":"The prices were slightly higher than at other Bloor sushi restaurants, but certainly not exorbitant. There were many combos for $15-$25. the rolls were large, though I had a bento box. They also brought our a roll on the house for the table (and didn't flinch when the baby at the table knocked over a glass of water.)  I also like that they had the ability to fit us in for a last minute 9 person reservation, and the service was very attentive. I would certainly return."}
{"text":"????????????????????\"special bento menu\"???????????????????????????????????5.99???A - chicken teriyaki?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to begin! Love the friendly Staffs!  I made a last minute reservation right before it closed for a surprise birthday lunch for my friend which is for the following day but I didn't say specifically it was for a birthday. We got there and when they foud out it was for a birthday, they gave us a complimentary sushi roll which was huge and enough for 9 people! And they also gave us packs of seaweed which was so kind and cute of them!  Anyways, it is an average downtown Toronto restaurant size and decently clean.  The food is fresh with a good portion and all for a good price. Totally worth the price especially if you order their special bentonite boxes. They served complimentary edemame, dumplings and miso soup.  One of my friend ordered a salmon dish because he is not allowed pork or chicken and the waitress was kind enough to tell the chef to use a new skillet to cook his fish due to his religious restrictions. I will be definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing japanese food. I especially love their tempura yam \"fries\"  so good! This place is reasonably priced,  the staff is very friendly,  and the foos is delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here. They claim that you can get 10% off on their menu but it does not say the limitations on this which I found out at check out. You have to spend over 10 dollars to get the discount and it is not valid on specials. Nowhere does it say this on the menu though. When i brought it to their attention, they were very rude and abrasive about it and said they wouldn't make the meal if I wasn't ok with it even though I was willing to pay it. It was false advertising and even though it is -- they did not deal with it with professionalism.   The food was okay. I've had better sushi. The order of sashimi came with four very small pieces - hardly filling. The chicken teriyaki was nothing special.   Won't be returning (mostly due to lack of professionalism)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It's tiny and the atmosphere is casual. The decor is nothing special, but I'm not into fancy, so it suited me just fine. The servers are always polite and efficient.   It wasn't very busy this time, so I was quickly seated and my food arrived promptly. I purchased the special $15 lunch. You get quite a bit for $15, so I left full and happy.   My bento box contained salmon teriyaki, 3 pieces of sushi, sticky rice, vegetable tempura (I asked for this instead of the shrimp tempura, which they accommodated). I also got 9 pieces of sashimi. The lunch also starts with miso soup and salad.   I enjoyed my experience and will be back again. If you're in the area and looking for something dependable and good then you should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place HAS to be your go-to for sushi. If you want a quick fix and don't care about quality, go elsewhere. This places puts time and effort into their dishes which is well worth the wait. The small and family like atmosphere makes Sushi Maido a wonderful addition to the Annex! The owners are absolutely darling, the servers are attentive and knowledgeable. Food comes out in timely fashion and they provide you with water or tea upon arrival. A lot of places don't give you water because they expect you to order something else (I.e., beer).   Their selection of food is a bit intimidating but once you come literally three times, you probably already know the entire menu and they know you as a regular. Overall, you will not see me go anywhere else for sushi while I live down here. I'm so glad they're here and I hope they're here for a long time to come.       !!  !!    ^^"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really a step above other Japanese restaurants in the area.  Everything is fresh, full of depth and flavour and extremely precise. I dined there during the grand opening and was very impressed and have made it a staple restaurant when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Decent place for sushi! Got the bento box dinner, and including tax and tip, the meal was under $20.   First, we got miso soup (which I found to be too salty). The salad was good - pretty acidic but I like that. Then they gave edamame beans for the table (free appetizer, yay!).  The bento box itself was quite nice. I really like how it came with seaweed salad. I've never gotten that in a bento box before. It also came with half a spring roll. The salmon teriyaki was yummy - a bit burnt in parts, but the flavour and texture was good. I substituted the white rice for brown rice ($1 extra), which I enjoyed. The california rolls tasted a bit off...wasn't sure what it was about them. But it's enough for me not to order any california rolls from here if I ever come back.   Tried some of the kalbi beef my friend ordered, as well as the tempura. Both were pretty decent.  At the end, they give you complimentary fruit, and candies with your bill. You get lots of extras eating here, which is nice! Food is pretty good, and spacious place to hang out."}
{"text":"Bumped into the shop at night. Probably one of the finest Sushi shop in the neighborhood. I have always been a huge fan of Nigiri, and this is the particular one shop that is mostly close to the upper-middle quality I have had nearby.  The beef here is great as well and it reminds me of all the good memories back in Asia.  Price range is pretty reasonable and affordable. Between 10 - 20 for a decent dinner set."}
{"text":"I would definitely go back again but! My food was a bit too sweet.  I love the rolls that my boyfriend ordered.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  I thought the price was a bit much for the food that was served.  The service is nice!  I would go back again to try new things"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend recently. It's a fairly small quiet sushi joint with maybe about 30-40 seats max.  As other reviews said it is slightly pricier than other sushi places on Bloor Street.  However, the quality is pretty good.    Both my friend and I had the sashimi donburi dish and the presentation was excellent and the sashimi was quite fresh and the hot sauce had a nice combination of hot and sweet.  However, my only complaint is that I wish the rice was served on the bottom instead of on the side.  Not sure why it bothers me, but it sort of does.    Verdict: If you are looking for a quiet place to have a sit down dinner with some friends and some quality sushi albeit at a slightly higher price."}
{"text":"not bad..... probably the selling point is that my entire bento box was 5.99 (they tried to charge me $3 more for seaweed salad over a real salad??? i kindly declined the offer)  avg size rolls, my mans rolls were too big however. He ended up dropping a roll and a half on the ground - i will be coming back here but not with him"}
{"text":"came here with a friend to chat.  They didn't kick us out even after a few hours of just sitting and chatting. but the rolls are really small. nice atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"I have been here for several times because it close to my house, and I always try different meals, their meals really surprise me, tasty and value for money, definitely will come often!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh.  You could taste the distinct flavours and quality of your food.  For example, you could easily distinguish the freshness of the shrimp in the shrimp tempura.  The tempura was perfectly crunchy while not overpowering or being overly greasy.   The service was excellent, efficient yet polite and patient.  I will definitely try to return here!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant as we decided to get off at Spadina station. Between 2 people, we ordered Super Kamikaje Maki and Tempura Udon. The Maki was great and very filling. Definitely one of the better ones ive tried.   Would go back for the makis !"}
{"text":"I went in for a take out order. The avocado hand roll and maki were good the shrimp tempura as well. I got dragon and spicy salmon they were ok. If you order take out you get 10% off."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Worst sushi I ever had. These people should be ashamed for serving that kind of garbage to customers. Chopped tuna sushi was repulsive. Tasted as spoiled tuna covered with sauce that was horrible... Salmon roll had salmon that had skin and huge white fat veins... This usually gets cut off and not served. Avocado roll had pieces of Avocado skin inside and Avocado was half brown... Tasted horrible. Unagi roll was just a mess of eil fat and skin. Everything was horrible... Nothing good to say about this place... Avoid."}
{"text":"Had the 70 piece chef special sashimi boat and a seafood pancake. Excellent fresh fish. Excellent service with a smile. Its not a cheap place but the overall exerience was great. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and got a rainbow roll. It was very filling. For the price, I don't think the sushi tasted that good, it just tasted like ordinary sushi to me."}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki was well cooked and marinated. It came on a sizzling platter and the portions were good. The staff was very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Came to maido w my girlfriend for lunch today as it's close to our apartment and cooking is insane. We had the lunch special bento box and it was mediocre but great for the price (my girlfriend paid). I dropped a piece of sushi on my lap and it fell on the floor but nobody saw xoxo"}
{"text":"Quick service, good value special bento boxes, although I wasn't a fan of the garlic topping on the salad, it may be the right way to have it though.   I got the salmon lover roll and it was enough to satisfy me - large roll and lots of salmon."}
{"text":"6$ Lunch Bentos  I got the salmon teriyaki with salad and miso soup. The salmon was good. The salad and miso soup were pretty average. Slightly smaller portion than expected but I'm assuming that the regular menu would have bigger portion options.  Pretty decent interior design. Average customer service. Around 5 people on a Monday noon.  Would like to try something else on their menu next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great quality, friendly service. I appreciated the little touches, such as hot towels before the meal as well as packages of dried seaweed for the kids while we were waiting."}
{"text":"Excellent! Sushi there is the best I have had in North America. Good fish to rice ratios which they usually cheap out on in Toronto. I will go back separately with everyone I know. Tasted just like the sushi I had at an expensive restaurant in downtown Tokyo last summer. Very authentic!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving sushi and decided to pop by after seeing a 5.99 bento special. We ended up getting a chicken and salmon teriyaki bento with the 20pc sashimi dinner. Everything was great! The salad, soup, fish, chicken, salmon were all flavorful. They even gave Edamame and fruit on the house! Service was top notch as well! The restaurant is small, quaint and quiet, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a close place to have lunch and im so glad i found this place!!  I order a tofu teriyaki lunch bento and basically stuffed myself for 8 dollars!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this restaurant get 4 stars. I had a sushi and sashimi dinner for my son. I played it safe to order beef bokulki. The fish was small and cool. The beef was dry and tasteless. The rice was dry and undercook. I am glad we didn't order anything fancy which will be waste of money. This dinner cost me $45. I probably get better value eating at the food court."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. A bit disappointing. Service was excellent though (food came quickly and staff were friendly). We ordered 18 pcs rolls/sashimi as well as a spicy scallop roll. It also came with soup and salad. They also gave us edamame beans. You know it's a problem when you enjoy those free sides more than the entrees.   The spicy scallop tasted a bit off. As though it had gone bad. When we told the waitress about it. She was very nice and even took it off our final bill. We didn't order anything else after as the other rolls were just average. The sashimi didn't seem too fresh. We were still hungry and went to McDonalds after."}
{"text":"The ingredients here are fresh and put together expertly. I believe the decor is leftover from the previous tenant (Tokyo Sushi?), but still tasteful and clean. Service isn't overly friendly, but it's quick and accurate. Maido does what it does well. It's a solid sushi joint."}
{"text":"This place has become my lunch go-to! The place is small, but if you can get a seat, it's a pretty cozy place to get a nice lunch or casual dinner.  They're consistently very friendly, very reliable and always make their take-out sushi in a reasonable amount of time. I think the sushi is quite tasty, but of course you're getting what you're paying for so don't expect Tokyo quality sushi.   The menu is also very reasonably priced. I highly recommend grabbing something from their lunch menu,which has some very tasty food at great prices. I'll upload a photo of the lunch special because it doesn't show on main menu or their website. It's also a pretty cheap way of getting an Unagi (eel) roll.  The staff will always say hello and are very kind, especially if you go there consistently. You really feel like they are pleased to see you there, which I think is a rare experience.   For the price range, I think this place is excellent!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after reading the Yelp reviews, and I too am impressed. They really seem to care about quality and service, unlike several other joints on the Annex sushi strip. I got the sushi lunch bento, and it's good value: first complimentary edamame, then a big bowl of miso, a big pile of impeccably fresh salad with a delicious, balanced housemade dressing (so different from the few pieces of limp iceberg you get at other places), two pieces of salmon, one piece of tuna sushi and one halibut. I'm not an expert but the fish tasted beautifully fresh to me. And THEN a complimentary scoop of ice cream. So really, that's a three or four course meal for $6. The décor is nice and understated. The service is outstanding. While I was there I saw the chef run out to chase a group down the street because they forgot their leftovers - he was gone for ages! Then he came back in, thanked another guest, and cleared a table. What a pro. The female server was very nice and attentive too. The little touches, like the carefully peeled cucumbers in the salad and the warm, perfectly salted, creamy edamame (did I mention they were complimentary?) show that they are really trying. You can also get a glass of decent wine for $4!! If only this place had a patio I'd be here all summer long. The only slight lapse - and why this is really a 4.5 star review rather than a 5 - was that, even though the place was by no means full, I felt slightly rushed towards the end of the meal. The waitress kept on coming over as if she wanted to clear the plates, even though I  was still eating. Which got a bit awkward after about the fourth or fifth time. And she brought the bill before I'd asked for it. In general, great discovery, I hope they make it."}
{"text":"Working near the Annex, there is no shortage of sushi joints in the area. My usual go-to lunch spot is New Generation but I find the quality inconsistent and often lacking, but that's for another review. As for Maido.. I was always hesitant to since they don't have as big of a specials menu as the others. Today, I finally decided to try it and called for a pick up (thanks to a fellow Yelper who'd posted their lunch specials menu!).   I got their lunch combo Maki A+B and chose salmon avocado, and yam tempura rolls.  Upon entering, staff was friendly and approachable. I was delighted to find their salmon avocado rolls with good amount of salmon.. couldn't go wrong with a classic choice. The highlight however was the yam tempura, I like how they use yam fries, made for crispier tempura and goes well in a sushi. My coworker tried it and remarked that it was still hot and not soggy. The combo comes with miso soup, which I find nicely seasoned.  So I'll say Maido is a solid choice if you're looking for cheap lunch options without sacrificing too much quality. For $9 (and that includes 13% tip) I was satisfied and planning to explore their menu."}
{"text":"Affordable sushi and you get a 10% discount for pick up. Great idea for being able to change your rice to a brown rice with an extra charge of course. When I came in, they ran out of the brown rice though and the lady gave me some chocolates to make up for it. Their sushi is not dry, very moist and tasty. You can tell that it was made fresh, even their sashimi! I usually just order salmon teriyaki even from other sushi places and theirs is really not that different. Still pretty good. I will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The food is really great. Try the shiitake maki, so good!  The service is slow.... But the food is really nice and if you can be patient with the service, totally worth it. Or just order take out :)"}
{"text":"I find it hard to rate sushi joints because they're all so similar. The service was solid and the food was good here. Pretty standard!"}
