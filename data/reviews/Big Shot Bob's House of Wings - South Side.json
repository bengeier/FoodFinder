{"text":"GOOD food. Nice place. Friendly and cool. If you want cheap food don't bother. They charge a fair price for some of the best wings in Pittsburgh area. Did I mention they have 150 sauces?"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner while in Pittsburgh for the first time. Hands down best wings I have ever had. We ordered 6 wings with a different flavor for each plate, not disappointed in the least. Loved it. If I lived here I'd come back"}
{"text":"Got the Black and Gold - perfect combination of sweet and spicy! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wings are good!; Be carful of guy ringing out math he charged me 65 cents over and was like whatever but then a pickup order came in while I was waiting and complained about being over charged around $1.10 so just be careful   Wings are good  Update : found out my issue is because they charge $.50 for ranch... Which is kind of insane because their wings are takeout already over a dollar apiece... but not sure what happened with the other lady because he did refund her and it did look like he was using a basic five dollar calculator to ring up orders"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I had been craving really good, saucy wings for about a week and decided to give Big Shot Bob's a try. I ordered 6 of the Game-changer wings (garlic, parm, Cajun seasoning, ranch, butter sauce) and they were PERFECT. This flavor is every yummy thing you could combine and coat chicken with. The wings are the perfect amount of crispy, as well. I already can't wait to go back and try more flavors. The staff was also super cool and friendly. Thank you for fulfilling my saucy wing cravings! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific wings with creative and delicious sausage. The employees were super helpful, friendly and attentive. Best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"As a super fan of chicken wings, my boyfriend and I are always trying out new places. After a friend suggested we try this place out for there several flavors we could not resist. The service was amazing with the guy behind the counter being very engaging and funny; he even sang at one point. The food itself is amazing. I had the pigeon wings, which is a mix of their Napoleon Sauce (mild and sweet), garlic, and Parmesan cheese. It was amazing although it could have used a bit more spice, but I think they have a flavor like that. My boyfriend had the Game-changers, which is a super mix of flavors including a butter sauce. I am actually making plans to go today as I am writing this review."}
{"text":"It would be hard to find a sauce that they do not offer. With over 50 flavors to pick from, you'll never get bored with the menu. However, that is where the creativity stops. Overpriced, average wings with nothing that really stands out from other places around town. This would not be the place i think of when i am in the mood for good wings."}
{"text":"Meh. Let me just break down my experience here.  Ordered wings on a Monday night. 3 different orders for 3 different people (we had a guest over). One of the orders was wrong. I called to inform them. They immediately offered to redo the order, but by then it was too late, as our guest had arrived and we were all hungry. I asked if I could just come by another time for the order. They took down my information and said that wouldn't be an issue. I forgot to ask their name.  That Saturday night (not even a week later), I decided to call and order the wings that I had originally wanted on Monday. After answering the phone with the wrong location name, the gentleman had no idea what I was talking about. I assured him that I had called earlier in the week and that my information was taken down. He couldn't find the document, but believed me anyway and made my wings. I came down to pick them up and heard a comment from one of the employees that I looked innocent so they believed I wasn't lying.   Annoying, inconvenient, and less than ideal of an experience. My boyfriend was SOO pumped about this place- I mean he talked about coming here for weeks. So when the experience here was less than average, it was really disappointing. We love wings, so we had big expectations. The wings themselves were meaty and tasty, but I just don't appreciate being given the wrong order after an hour wait on a Monday night and then being questioned about getting replacement wings not even a week later. It's discouraging, as a customer and makes me not want to return. Mistakes happen, I get that and I completely understand. But if you take down my information to fix the mistake, then do not document it well so that your other staff is informed of the mistake, it's not ideal. For the time being, we won't be returning. Perhaps we will give them another chance, but in the interim I'll just continue going to local bars who have cheaper wings and get my order right the first time."}
{"text":"The wings were outstanding!  Cooked long enough to be crisp,  yet still tender.   Choosing a sauce was difficult because there are over 150 flavors.   We ordered their version of Louisiana Lickers and there were even better than The Lube's.   We also had the Napoleon Jerk and they were finger-licking good!   Yum"}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent!!!  I have not had wings this good since I can remember.  Every flavor we tried (we tried 4) was awesome.  Be sure to order at least one flavor that has dry flavorings.  This was new to me but totally amazing."}
{"text":"Best wings around, so far. Very large and cooked to perfection. Soooo many flavors to chose from. Big Fine Woman being A family favorite, but we've never been disappointed. Sometimes they put too much Parmesan on my Hot Garlic Parm! darn!' Anyway, I hear their subs are great!! Can't wait to try. The wings will cost ya like any good wing will. We've been there probably twenty times since they opened the Beechview location."}
{"text":"I've eaten the bone-in wings a few times and they were always delicious. Tonight I was extra lazy and felt like ordering boneless wings for delivery. Let me preface this with the fact that I'm actually not a huge chicken tender/boneless chicken fan. The consistency in the middle can be odd depending on the quality of the chicken you get when you order them. However, these were so good I had to give them a great review. I ordered 8 of the Talk of Beaver Falls and 8 dry Cajun.  As a bonus, they originally said it would be an hour and fifteen minutes but then changed it to 45 min when I said I lived a few blocks away. They were delivered in exactly 45 minutes..pretty impressive."}
{"text":"We headed in last night for dinner. Big shot Bob's is really popular where I'm from and I wanted to see for myself how good it was. 6 wings are about $7.99 and 13 wings are are $13.99 if i remember correctly. Kind of pricey honestly.. Just saying.  We decided on 13 wings and were told we could only get one sauce. Very disappointing. One sauce for 13 entire wings. No. Just no. They also charge $0.50 for ranch.  We tried the Talk of Beaver Falls which seemed to be a hit. It was entirely too spicy for me so i asked if they had a version less hot. Cashier suggested Eye of the Tiger which is talk of beaver falls + ranch. Still spicy but the ranch cooled it down.   We also ordered a side of fries. Fries were fresh cut and good, but extremely soggy. I was looking forward to fresh, crispy fries.   Overall the wings were good.. Again pretty pricey for the size but the sauces are what you're paying for I'm assuming. Customer service is also friendly. Their menu of hoagies seemed declious.  Wings take 15-22 minutes to cook so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot based on hearing their name passed around on the radio and what not.  First impressions, more expensive than expected..25 dollars for 18 medium sized wings (1.40/wing).  Went there at a slow time where there was only one other person waiting on their food and it was a 35 minute wait for 18 wings.  Got my wings and no ranch/celery(that extra) in three different flavors. They boast 150 flavors but I noticed that almost all the signature flavors were just combinations of other flavors (example: blue cheese + hot sauce or hot sauce + pepper)  First flavor was ranch/hot sauce/Parmesan, it was pretty good.  Second flavor was a Louisiana lickers and really just tasted like a standard mild sauce  Third flavor was a hot sauce + cayenne pepper and it was so salty I only ate two before tossing the rest.  I only tried three of the flavors but with the long wait and more expensive prices I'll stick to somewhere else in the future(some good places around south side for wings  are Mario's and Twelve)"}
{"text":"Really great staff.  I met Bobby on a few occasions and all were positive.  Good food all around!"}
{"text":"Wing paradise. I'm sure their other menu options are fine as well, but you come here for one thing, and one thing only. Seemingly bottomless flavors: you could eat here every day for almost five months and not repeat a flavor. They go for creativity and quality over heat most of the time, but there's a few good options for hardcore chili heads as well."}
{"text":"These have got to be the best wings I've ever had in my life! From the over 50 flavors to the Crispy-ness of the wings. I was head over heels after my first bite. I've had my share of wings and wing flavors in my life and these hands down are the best. I'd gladly stop by anytime I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"With over 150 flavors they offer, BSB's is the best buffalo wings joint in Pittsburgh. Period. We tried Bob's sig hot and Talk of Beaver Falls and they were both delicious! We also had a cheeseburger and it was good! I wish they served alcohol beverage but other than that there was nothing weak about their wing game!"}
{"text":"If there is a food that has a combination of delicious sauces and some heat, it is on my list of favorites. Wings...oh my....are definitely in my top 5 foods. There are so many places in Pittsburgh to get a proper wing too. While I frequent both Birmingham Bridge Tavern and Sidelines in order to get my fix, I have not been ignorant to Big Shot Bob's. I had their wings a few years ago at a Superbowl party and spent most of the game with my face in hot sauce instead of watching the game (don't worry, the Steelers were not playing). Luckily that was not my last taste of happiness.   I recently went to the location in South Side that just opened up and it did not disappoint! I ordered the Walk of Beaver Falls and Superfly TNT. I loved the Superfly but the Walk of Beaver Falls was slightly sweeter than my preference. My brother did trade me one of his Headless Horseman, which is a spicy horseradish, and I loved that as well. Overall the service was good and the wings were crispy and saucy.  A week later, I had another fortunate tasting when I went to a party at Allegheny City Brewing and 8 different flavors were ordered...8! Wow! I had to pinch myself. I tried my best to not eat all 250 wings that were ordered but I had to attempt to eat at least a few flavors. Some of the stand outs were the Talk of Beaver Falls, which was very peppery and lovely, and Black Magic, which was a dry cajun. I think that if you are looking for a place to get great wings, especially for a party, Big Shot Bob's is an excellent option!"}
{"text":"I've been to their other locations but Bob's never disappoints. Decent sized wings, not shy with the sauce and plenty of options and flavors to satisfy your wing craving.   The talk of Beaver falls is my favorite, tangy, spicy, sweet but hot. Just a delicious wing sauce, you can't go wrong with it. They delivered 50 wings fast and they were all delicious.   If you want wings, Big Shot Bob's is your place."}
{"text":"One day on FB I saw this place won best wings in PA. As a foodie and big lover of wings, my husband and I tried this out with our kids. We were the only ones there for awhile so the young gentleman was super nice and split sauces for us so we could try quite a bit. Every sauce we had was really good. The wings were meaty and the prices were good for what you get."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying the Food is as good as all the other locations...  Now let's talk service and atmosFEAR.... (The owner should look into this place)  I took three other friends that never had Bob's Wings before and I'm used to the Avalon location. but picked Southside because it's a location you could eat in. Well we got there and the place is fine but a little dingy for a place that's only been there for a year. When we came in there was three employees milling around behind the counter and we could tell at least one more in the back. We said hello as we walked in and none of them acknowledged we were even their so I picked up a menu from the counter and took my guests back to a table. I explained the menu and got an order together we picked what we wanted. So I went to the counter and at that time there was two Employees behind the counter. And I stood there for a bit looking at the two an neither one really doing anything so after about a minute of not being acknowledged I said can I place and order.  One of the guys came over and I ordered.  The guys added it up on his Infamies (read some other reviews) calculator and said it would be 54 dollar and something. Thinking this was a little high because I go to the Avalon location and if you get four you get the fifth on free but even being charged for the fifth one doing the math and figuring in the tax I was charged 8.00 dollars for the Coke & Water and over 15.00 if the fifth is free.  I was reading other reviews and this is a common problem I thing he rounds everything up to the dollar as he adds it up but just guessing.  But if that's not bad enough so when he gave me my change back he then just walked off. I stood there for a bit did he go to  get the drinks or what? So after a bit I just sat down with my friends, well he never did get the drinks and we sat there till some one popped out of the rear door with our wings dropped them on the table and rushed back into the kitchen. So I went back to the counter and another guy was there a told him we never got our drinks 3 waters a coke and 4 orders of Celery 2 ranch and 2 blue cheese , he walked over and puts drinks on the counter then stands there for a bit while I pike up the drinks and walk then to the table, I come back and stand there and he looks at me like what? I then said the Celery? He goes in the back and pops out that back door and hands my table two things of celery I walk back and say that's 4 celery 2 ranch and 2 Blue cheese, he pops out again with 2 celery and three ranch. Close enough I give up...   Now here is the best part as we finally got close to what we ordered. Twice a fight broke out in the back with slamming of items and shouting that us and the other two table where looking at each other like  should we evacuate or what. Then you would hear them go back to work un till another outburst or other commotions with the staff... We probably would have had a better experience sitting on the side walk on Carson..  Well at least the food was good.  and please don't look bad on other location because there not like this.."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in big shot bob's. I went there for the first first time I go 50 boneless wings. I did half teriyaki's and half something else he said it was a big seller but the flavor I couldn't even grab my attention to remember the name...... but the teriyaki sauce tease like it was just toss in soy sauce and that's it. After eating 4 of them I just gave them away. No one like it."}
{"text":"Waaaaaay overpriced !! Now let's get into the food. Sauces were great. No doubt about it. Fries were delicious ! Wings were too big and undercooked. Would give this place another try if it wasn't so overpriced. The wing combinations are also very weird."}
{"text":"Best wings in the city!!  Soooo many awesome sauce choices (don't hesitate to ask for a sample) food portions and wings  are huge and definitely worth the price. My favorite place on the South Side for sure"}
