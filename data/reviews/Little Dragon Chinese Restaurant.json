{"text":"best place in phx. i been going here for 14-15 years now...."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  We ate here on Saturday night and it was packed!  The food is sooo good even though it is not in that great of an area.  I ordered the orange chicken combo which came with egg drop soup (delish!), veggie egg roll, fried rice and a huge helping of orange chicken.  My husband also got the combo but with Mongolian shrimp and he enjoyed his dish as well.  And we took home a to-go box with another meal for a midnight snack!  :)   It was a very modertate price for the quality and quantity received.  I totally recommed this place and will be eating here more since it is really close to my workplace."}
{"text":"Have been coming to little Dragon since I was little and I can definitely say this is the best Chinese food in phoenix period. I took my best friend there and she's obsessed. Nice family owned restaurant, the same family they're so nice and the customer service is great."}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices were very reasonable. Although I was very disappointed with the service. I received my food a good ten minutes before my company received their food. It was a little awkward as we waited. Also they're not big on making sure their guests are comfortable; I had to ask twice for a refill before I actually got one..."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, we have been coming here for years.  My family and extended family love this place.  This is the only place we go for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming  Chow mein is way starchy/ goopy Use charsiu pork, which seemed strange to me. Also let me caveat to say that I usually am a huge fan of charsiu pork, but I really didn't care for the taste of the charsiu pork on my noodles Veggies include bean sprouts and cabbage only  But at least the flavor is decent. Nice and garlicky, not too salty  Egg rolls were filled with cabbage (nothing else inside); also tasted like it was fried w ith old oil."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice atmosphere. Food was tastee, and big size meals. Left really full. The only thing I didn't like was No Free Refills on soda. Otherwise great food!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to little dragon since I was a little girl. I love the food it's always the same great taste. I love the consistency. I now bring my family and sure the great food and memories with them."}
{"text":"This is the best thing you've ever been with me to come back to the best Chinese restaurant and I don't have to be a liar. Ana Wong and family."}
{"text":"Great place ! Got here literally 3 minutes before closing and they still made us food! Andy was very polite and the lady who took the order was as well (:"}
{"text":"Absolutely had the worst experience my wife found a piece of wire from what looked like a scrubbing pad in her food when we told the manager she hid the wire and asked if we were still going to eat and pay absolutely the worst service"}
{"text":"this place is bad news.came here on a Saturday night with my family and will not be returning. customer service is by far the worst I have ever   Experienced , the food was cold, the water tast like it came out a waterhose from the back. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband took me for lunch... and man oh man was it good! I ordered the Orange Chicken combo which came with egg drop soup, fried wontons, and an egg roll. I also ordered the hot tea. I haven't had that in years! This place did not disappoint. Great food at a reasonably low price with huge portions makes me a happy wife . Def coming back to try other items."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. I go for the plumpest potstickers in town that rival some of the greats in the valley. Large portions and prompt service are a hallmark of Little Dragon"}
{"text":"Good food for the price. A little dirty on the inside, but wonderful people that work there!"}
{"text":"There was a restaurant like this back where i lived in California and im glad that my In-laws introduced me to this place. its Exactly like the one i used to go to...down to the taste!...will be coming here when im in the mood for chinese food :)"}
{"text":"Staff was bothered by every table it seemed..it was hot and humid not a good temperature for so e in and although food was hot it took about 45 min to get to the table maybe only to go orders from here on out"}
{"text":"Little dragon is a family owned restaurant and they are always nice. Sometimes they're slammed busy and sometimes they're very slow.  I always like to support small business and this place is a hit I always get the walnut  shrimp and usually pot stickers (great).  I also ordered almond duck (good) and pork fried rice.  Very big portions shared with a family of 4.  Kind of pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"I dont understand the good ratings on this restaurant. First i have to say that the only thing i eat when i go to a chinese restaurant is fried rice. And this fried rice was horrible taste like cooked rice not fried rice. Not a fan and definitely not going back."}
{"text":"From Southern California came here after a Cardinals game last year, and have been looking forward to returning here to eat again when I visit again in November. We have a plethora of Asian and Chinese food restaurants her in L.A. and I have a high standard for such places because of it, and this little gem was something I wasn't expecting in the middle of Arizona.    Great portion sizes and affordable prized, especially for how much food you get, but even more for how delicious everything is! Real Chinese food, and so many options to choose from that we ordered a little bit of everything, which ended up in a lot of food to take home for later.  Staff was very attentive and friendly, and the restaurant was extremely inviting. A great place to eat, especially with friends and/or family so that you can share and taste a little bit of everything this place has to offer, because it's all just that delicious."}
{"text":"So we were looking for a buffet...and ended up here Bc of onstar...:( But actually thanks to yelp we saw pretty good...we were already here so, it was pretty darn good...:) Good choice, and I don't eat Chinese food!!! We had the wanton soup(was amazing),the shrimp and egg rolls (shrimp was really good, egg roll was okay), and my fiancée had sweet and sour pork(was really good and it's deep fried), I had the paper steak(was just good), and the best was the pork fried rice ( my fiancée keep raving about how good it was and he has high expectations!)...lol... Pretty fast service..:) Very nice people..."}
{"text":"Great value and super good food. Felt a bit rushed during dinner , and was surprised since there was only one other family dining in. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. My husband and I always have the Orange Chicken Combo. I live in Tempe and travel a long way just to come and eat Orange Chicken. They don't charge you for ice tea refills, only for soda and lemonade.. Just an FYI. The two sister owners are kind of different, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Food was good but there was a roach I  the wall of our booth.   When we left the chased us outside because we signed the wrong receipt.   They didn't even discount our lunch for the roach but give us a hard time about signing wrong receipt,  cust vs merchant"}
{"text":"This place isn't in the greatest place of town but their food is incredible. I recommend their vegetable soup it is great!"}
{"text":"Very very good American Chinese food. Came very quick, with friendly service. You get plenty of food for the price. Plan on taking some home. Blah blah blah...words words words."}
{"text":"Food is good, they have large portions that you can share and still have leftovers for the next day. I love the soup. Worth the price thats for sure. Service from all the times I have been there seem ok not the best but I guess I know what to expect at this place now. Will keep returning."}
{"text":"This is the place for hot and sour soup! I always order it when I go there and it is always awesome. It comes with large shrimp and pieces of chicken so it makes a great lunch on a cold day. It is also something I like to eat when I am not feeling well.  The rest of the food there is good also and not very expensive. I take a friend sometimes and we split a bowl of soup and a lunch entree. Plenty of food for both of us and for around $10-$13 it's a great deal for lunch! This place has been around for a very long time and I hope it stays around for alot longer.."}
{"text":"No soda refills. horrible customer service. They don't like when you order water. Food is decent but the service kills appetite."}
{"text":"I just ordered Chinese here from the first time, based off the reviews.. I ordered my food to go. When I made it home I was highly disappointed the food i ordered was disgusting, I ordered shrimp fried rice which was half cooked still fairly cold with big chunks of white rice. The egg rolls and crab puff smelled like they were fried in old grease. My experience was not good ..........do not eat here."}
{"text":"Food is always good, fresh, hot, and delicious we been going for about 2 years already the owner and co- workers from there already now us we order the same thing always!!! Best orange chicken"}
{"text":"Food is good price for 3 it will be like $10 per person the only downside is that the do not free refill on the  drinks you have to paid for dose.  So if you are thinking about getting more soda prepared yourself with another 2.75 per cup it has more ice than liquid."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food next to May Gardens. Cheap food for low price. Always get the same thing and never go wrong. Granddaughter and daughter always have the orange chicken!! I am very picky about restaurants anymore."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a whim for the first time last night I'm always very skeptical about Chinese food places but this place has amazing food. The gentleman who helped us was so nice he sat there and actually had an engaging conversation and even told us the story behind how the Chinese got their animals for  the birth years. We have been looking for a good place to get Chinese for years and we finally found it."}
{"text":"We had the most AMAZING dining experience here all because of our server Andy! The food was great but Andy made our night perfect! Go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out last week on take-out wanting to try something new.  I ordered the Orange Chicken and Shrimp Egg Foo Young.  The Orange Chicken was plentiful.  I could have easily fed two people with the amount they give.  It was Ok!  It probably would have been better if I had eaten there, instead of take out.  My friend did not like the Shrimp Egg Foo Young.  He said that it was tasteless.  No type of season.  He absolutely LOVES Egg Foo Young, so if he did not like it, I believe him when he said that something was off.  I may think about trying this place out again.  There was another dish on the menu that I want to try out.  But, I won't be making any special visits just because I have to have it."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for chinese food.  It's right around the corner and can always be counted on when I need my curry shrimp fix!  I also really enjoy the won ton soup and combo fried rice.  The pepper steak is another good one.  Everything always seems to be really fresh and the prices are reasonable!  If you're in the area and have a taste for Chinese, Little Dragon is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and the food here is beyond delicious every time. Looks are deceiving with the restaurant, but you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese as we were tourists in Phoenix.  If this is what Phoenix has to offer for Chinese food, we were extremely disappointed.  To start off with, our waitress was the least friendliest and unhelpful person in the world.  She acted like she could care less if we were there or not.  Should of been our first clue to run away.  But we stuck it out and when we did, we were even more disappointed.  The Kung Po chicken had no POW at all and was filled with chestnuts more than meat and NO vegtables besides a ton of onions.  A lot of fillers and no substance.  The egg roll and dry and tastless.  I've had better food at those dollar scoop Chinese places.  Maybe people in Phoenix just think that is acceptable because they have never experienced anything different, but avoid this place if you are just traveling through and know good Chinese from bad."}
{"text":"You can't ask for much more when you're in the mood for some Chinese food.   Came in for a quick bite and was surprised by the portion sizes.   Owner is friendly and accommodating and the restaurant has been around for ages. Very loyal customer base.   Ordered the general's chicken, fried rice, and potstickers. Left with enough leftovers for another full meal.  The general's chicken was crispy and sweet with a slight kick. The potstickers were hearty/meaty and huge. The fried rice was light and had some bean sprouts that added a nice crunch.  Come here for some tasty food. It won't disappoint.    The owner also made us some amazing yellow curry. Wasn't sure if it was on the menu but it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"If you're not sure where to go while visiting pheonix, try this place. It's pretty decent and the food is great.; quiet and serene environment. I'd definitely revisit! Minus one star because one of the waitresses is rude"}
{"text":"This place is good! It's not blow-your-mind delicious, but it's consistently good, with quick service and large portions. Fried rice is kind of meh but the crystal walnut shrimp is delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaraunt go take my family. Portion sizes are great, the pot stickers are amazing. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese Restaurants! Enjoy the lunch specials that you can also purchase after the 3:pm deadline. Chicken Chop Suey is our favorite, but everything is freshly made, not sittings in warmers. people very friendly and family owned."}
{"text":"Good food. Hot. Large portions. Waited at counter a bit to order takeout but was pretty fast after I ordered. Has a dining area that looked ok, it's an old building, like a cafe building. But worth checking out more.."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with little dragon! I've been coming to this place for over 20 years and it never gets old. I was raised eating theor food and my children were raised eating their food. Andy and his family are always providing great customer service and great food. In the words of my 5 year old Mom, let's eat Dragon soup. (Egg drop SOUP from Little DRAGON) lol  Thank you Tang family!!   From the Ponce Family!"}
{"text":"Little place and kind of shabby inside, but don't let that fool you. Their food is amazing and their ice tea is the best."}
{"text":"We're visiting from out of state and a cousin brought us here. The food is good although it looks different than from the one we're used to. AND they give you big portions...there are two waitresses one of them was really rude! She doesn't seem to understand what you want or gets irritated to have you in and out quick. I would revisit though, just push aside the fact that there's bad cs!"}
{"text":"Found this nice Chinese restaurant. Reminds me of home cooking by my parents. Friendly staff and surprisingly busy! Price is very fair and got me the egg drop soup...pretty good! Now to the main course...extra spicy kung pao chicken.  Not disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. We have been on the search for our go to Chinese restaurant and this place is it. The food is very good and you get a lot of it for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Kung Paola's good... Trying General Tsao today"}
{"text":"Was expecting better  We were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in at Little Dragon Chinese Restaurant. The staff at Little Dragon were friendly and it seemed to be a very popular spot with the locals.  On this visit we ordered the Pork Chow Mein and Pork Egg Foo Yung, we were disappointed with both entrée's. The seasoning level was non-existent and the pork was dry and very overcooked. Next we tried the Eggrolls and Fried Won Tons, once again very disappointed in the flavor. Our meals just weren't very good.   I love Chinese food however, I would not recommend Dragon based on what we ordered. But since there is a big selection on the menu, maybe the other entrée's  are better tasting."}
{"text":"I use to go eat here all the time maybe 3 times a week food was never bad but the service sucks big time the last time I went I even told the little old lady I would never return because there service . dinning room really old and depressing. But food just ok to me : )"}
{"text":"Food is great! Fresh vegetables and ingredients. Service was fast and the staff attentive.   I had the slow cooked pork w/ vegetables... Yum. This place is better then what I had anticipated! I'll be back! #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Food is always good. I have been coming here for years and have became good friends with the owners. They always know exactly what I want and make sure there is plenty for everyone."}
{"text":"Always enjoy our experience at Little Dragon. Foods delicious and very affordable. Atmosphere is also low key. One of our family favorites."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this restaurant. It was very good with large portions of food. I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce dinner combination with fried rice, fried won ton, vegetable egg roll/w a sweet sauce for dipping and egg drop soup.  The food was hot and delicious. The service was excellent and the restaurant was clean and neat. I recommend dining here if you are looking for a good Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has decent neighborhood Chinese food.  Kung pao and orange chicken were tasty dishes. Dont expect 4 star cuisine and you'll be very happy with what the kitchen puts out everyday. Eggrolls and crab puffs were fresh and yummy too."}
{"text":"Great food. Kung delight thumbs up.   Big portions. Yum but bring your own drink. There's no refills."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I already really like this place. Was sat down right away, no wait time. Got my hot tea and egg drop soup right away, which both are really good. Then my chicken and vegetables came out shortly and it is also very good. Staff friendly food is great and prices as well."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years and always enjoy their food.  For some reason I only go once a year but the food never changes! To me, this is chinese food. When you pull up it looks small, but when you walk inside you realize how far back it goes.  I ordered the #13 Spicy Orange Chicken. Its a large portion served with a heaping mound of white rice(it could be brown rice but I think its white with soy sauce), a decent sized egg roll and 2 of those chip things stuck on top. If your eating in, you get a small bowl of egg drop soup. This is the only thing I have issue with, its bland! Its always beautiful and the texture creamy but no spices are used. BUT just add a dash of salt and pepper and its delicious!  This place isn't packed but quite a few tables taken whenever I go in. Its good for small or large groups, they have these round tables and a turn thing...lazy suzanne? In the middle so you can turn it to the dish you want.  The service is pretty good and the restaurant is always nice and clean."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! Great service too. Ive been coming here for the past 10 years and it has never dissapointed me. I just saw a waitress go out of her way to bring a cellphone to a customer who forgot it in the table! That is so great i think."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Chinese food. I've been eating here since 1997. Their fried rice is amazing. I also like the Moo Goo Gai Pan- it has chicken, celery, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, & bok choy in a garlic sauce. I just recently ordered it with shrimp & I really enjoyed it. Their sweet sauce is the best,especially with the fried wontons! If you like egg drop soup, they serve a very tasty one as well. I do agree that the inside is retro, but it's clean & the food is great. The staff is friendly- the 3 ladies have been there forever. If you are expecting fine dining, don't go. But Prices are reasonable & you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Great food, low prices, and huge quantity! So excited to have a Chinese place near my office!"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles, ca. I was in town for the Rams vs. Cardinals game. This gem was recommend  to my by a local at the game. The Mongolian beef was amazing, Orange chicken tasty and crunchy. The house chow fun..... was out of this world, bursting with flavor. This is must any time I'm back in Phoenix. We were taken care by Andy, the owner of the restaurant, I have never been treated so well. The best the desert has to offer."}
{"text":"Like most low cost Chinese American restaurants, this place is run down. The interior is dark and shabby. I've been here 4-5 times and won't be returning. The fried rice is good. The Chow fun is ok but very greasy. Most of the menu items are pretty much what you would expect. The food is not bad, but not great either.  However the service is terrible.  I walked in at exactly 8:40pm on a weeknight. The neon open sign was lit. The business hours sign says they close at 9pm. The guy looked at me like he was confused, wondering why I was in his restaurant. He said can I help you ?  Surprised, I told him I was here to eat. He refused me service. He said they were closed. I knew that couldn't be right and checked my cell phone. Their wall clock was 15 minutes fast ! I pointed out to him that it was only 8:40, that's a long ways from 9:00. He said \"Hey, I'm trying to get out of here\".    I was by myself. It's not like I was going to order $100 worth of food.   I guess if their business is doing so good they can afford to turn down a repeat paying customer 20 minutes before closing time, they don't need anymore of my business."}
{"text":"Great portions and food taste great. Service is good... Been coming here for years and years... My entire family all come here we all are regulars."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! If you want authentic Chinese food this is not the place. Let see  yesterday I came into the restaurant first time being there I knew I should've turned around when I look at the landscaping in the lot. Anyway I order egg foo yong and shrimp with lobster sauce .I am originally  from Chicago and have had some the best Chinese food in the world we have a Chinatown there! food that I got yesterday was not the same and I'm accustomed to even though there was Chinese people cooking it. Anyway those shrimp with lobster sauce was horrible no way you supposed to make shrimp with lobster sauce like with peas and carrots to distantly it should be made like a chop Suey or like sum gum. And the egg foo yong was cooked like making a pattie with the meat & vegetables inside the patty with the eggs and bean sprouts but instead all I got was a egg patty! I'm not a Chinese person but I have a Chinese food in my lifetime to noted this wasn't right. My dog didn't want to eat this food so why should anyone else."}
{"text":"This place have the best food I've ever tasted I am so addicted to this place that I am willing to drive from San Diego to Phoenix just to have some. The orange chicken is a must. It's a small place but the service is great and the pricing is just right. The portion size is amazing. I visit Phoenix quite a bit and I always have to eat here. I only wish they were in San Diego."}
{"text":"This spot has been in my mom's neighborhood for quite a while, but I can't say that I have dined here much. On a recent trip to visit my mom's place, I just got the biggest hankering for some good ol' Chinese food (we all get this right? not just me?). So I decided to give this place a chance. I am so glad I did!  When we first walked in, all the waitresses were at the front, but they quickly dispersed and the one left standing didn't appear all to happy to be left with the daunting task of taking our order. With that being said, my girlfriend and I took a look at each other, and decided we would eat at home (didn't want to trouble the wait staff too much). We looked at the menu, and of course all the classics were there, Beef n' Broccoli, Orange chicken, sesame, chow mein, lo mein, etc!   We decided on the Sweet n' Sour Pork, Sesame Chicken, fried wonton and got some veggie fried rice. The food was ready pretty quick, and we rushed home! Everything looked awesome, smelled great, and upon first bite we quickly transcended time and space, and were teleported to Chinese food paradise. The sesame chicken was crunchy and sweet, and the sweet and sour pork was the kind where you put your own sauce, so I got to drench my food in that wonderful sauce! The vegetable fried rice was nice and hearty, with lots of broccoli, more than anything. We were admittedly slightly disappointed with the wontons, as we thought they would be the kind with a little filling inside, but they were just the flat strips.   Needless to say, it was a good meal, definitely good Chinese food, and will return.  It didn't get the five stars due to the wanton, and shifty staff. Other than that, it would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is great, flavorful and fresh.  The place is clean even though it could use remodeling.  the ambiance could use a little help, i know it is a family place, but too many kids running around for my taste."}
{"text":"Place has been here as long as i can remember. If your looking for a hook up. They will. Biggest egg drop soup I've ever recieved with a 6 dollar combo. Just great Chinese food"}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner. Ordered a few plates and all were super yummy and they were enough for more than one serving and there was like 11 of us. Price was under $100 for everything. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work & had Chow Fun and Orange Chicken dishes. The Chow Fun had 3 different meats in a brown sauce, stir fried with noodles. It was very flavourful & had more Beef then Shrimp in it. The Orange Chicken, was cooked to perfection with a great Orange sauce. Both dishes where worth the travel. My Waitress and the staff there were pleasant and inviting. I highly recommend all Yelpers who are Fans of Asian/American Cuisine, to try this place."}
{"text":"Same o samo Chinese, ho hum! Yes, snoozer! No different from other Chinese places. Sad! Took advantage of the lunch combo $5.95 to go. Got the sweet n sour pork and the wife got the chicken chow mien. The pork was mostly batter and the chow mien was bland. The portions were good and the fried rice wasn't bad and surprisingly it had flavor. I wanted to swap the rice for lo mein noodles but they said NO even after I said I would pay an additional charge. Got a side of egg drop soup too. Bland and the texture was off putting. Kinda like phlegm. The egg rolls I think were made in house and were pretty good compared to others that use a frozen factory made product. I'm not sure I'll be returning cuz Panda Express has the same thing but it's closer. Oh and by the way 45 min wait for take out so call in advance if you are willing."}
