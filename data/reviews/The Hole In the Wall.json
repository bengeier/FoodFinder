{"text":"This Junction gem has a lot going for it:  - Great local brews on tap - Charming and very tastefully decorated a narrow space It's called Hole in the Wall for a reason - Bartenders with great personalities and mixology skills. - Nightly delicious specials (try the fried chicken or the hangar steak) - The Cuban sandwich. - Live music!  And, most importantly:  - Key lime pie - Key lime pie - Key lime pie"}
{"text":"The review is for the dinner special meatloaf. The best meatloaf i have ever had, it tasted like pull pork, the meat was a perfect texture that melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is small and cozy and everyone is friendly. The first time I went with my BF it was packed but a couple who was sitting at a table for 4 offered us the other half of their table! I suspect this happens often since it's such a tiny place. The food is AMAZING, inexpensive and innovative. Last night we got the \"Austrian Big Mac\" 2 schnitzels instead of beef patties and the Tostada with Yam, fresh slaw, salsa verde, etc. You will not be disappointed at this place! However if you are a stickler for fast service you might be upset since it's usually just 1 waiter and a bartender. It's a laid back place, but that's what I like about it!"}
{"text":"Great place for drink, I will surely bring more friends over next time."}
{"text":"Quietly hidden away between various storefronts near Dundas and Keele is this absolute gem, The Hole in the Wall. A long narrow bar with limited seating, live music, amazing food, and some of the best drinks in the city served by bartender Casey.  This place is a fantastic option whenever you are strolling around the Junction neighbourhood. The vibe is laid back and comfortable. There are some great daily specials including wings and a pint for $12 on Mondays! As this place is fairly small, it is best to get here early to avoid disappointment!  The food can be looked at as comfort with a twist. One of my favourite dishes is the duck confit wings. Perfect amount of hot sauce but careful touching your eye after having these, talking from experience here. The burger is always on point as well as any of the terrines or pates they make! The value is good for the food you get and daily dinner features always keep the menu interesting!  There are a variety of beers on tap, and like the food, they are constantly changing! The cocktails are superb, Casey really takes care of us when we are there! Anyone looking for liquor will be happy to see they have an extensive list of scotch, whisky, gin, and rum!   No negatives about this place! The Hole in the Wall is a hidden gem with flavourful food, a well curated cocktail list, and some good live music!  An easy 5/5!"}
{"text":"I just love this place...  It's cozy, has a great atmosphere, the service is excellent and the food always delicious.  One of my favorite places in the west end."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place immensely. Despite being a hipstery place with half the clientele wearing plaid shirts, it still manages to surprise you with its originality in decor and food choices. I had a cocktail with 10 ingredients - delicious but pretty much a Negroni. My friend had scotch followed by a beer so local, that it came from the neighborhood! We also had the meat plate, which was fantastic and surprising, and fun to enjoy. The only thing I didn't like were the slightly hiked up prices - it's not something you'd venture for a quick bite, as our bill for three drinks and a food item came up to $60+tip. No wonder hipsters are poor."}
{"text":"What a surprise to say the least. The Hole in the Wall, from the outside, appears to be just that. Once inside, you'll see a very narrow space with maybe 20 or so tables. It looks like the place actually used to be an alleyway between two buildings that they slapped a roof over.  However, once seated, you'll find that the beer selection is awesome and the staff are super friendly. But it's the food that's the biggest surprise of all. Who would have guessed that the quality of food in such a place would be so elevated and so tasty? The key-lime pie was especially good.  Will be back here for sure, as I hear they have an amazing brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great beer!  Highly recommend the croquets!!!  Quiet atmosphere, and it really is a hole in the wall which lends to the charm of the place."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. The music, drinks and space are just right. The owner, on the other hand, is not someone who seems to care about repeat customers. He is not friendly, welcoming nor accommodating. If he was just a tiny bit nicer to customers, I would consider coming back to this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Came on a buck-a-shuck oyster night and it was PACKED. This place is a literal \"hole in the wall\", super tiny, but dressed up nice. Loved the vibe of this place and the food was great (I had several oysters and I stole some of my sister's mac and cheese, all very good). I definitely would come back, though my boyfriend did complain that it was \"too hipster\" for his liking so if that means anything to you, take that into account."}
{"text":"The beer has always been good.  The food is great.  Very inventive fare.  Pork belly pancakes and brisket poutine are the best  new menu additions.  Service very friendly too."}
{"text":"??????????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????? ?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a taste of their home-brewed \"community nut-job\" beer. It was delicious! Great staff and friendly atmosphere. A great place to have a pint!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite bars in Toronto. Intimate vibe and cool decor, great crowd, awesome beers, and lively music. Best bar in The Junction. Also right across from Indie Ale and some awesome restaurants close by--so great place to end a date."}
{"text":"By night or by day, an island of calm in the rising tide of gentrification and pseudo-urbanity that is The Junction.   I am tempted to write a bad review, to get the T-Dogs to stop surfing our break, but even shoulder to shoulder, this is one of the best bars anywhere. Even the wallpaper and woodworking can transport you away to another world, the escape that a bar usually needs spirits to accomplish.  The staff are a crack team of top shelf raconteurs and libationists, who in the slow moments will delight in stopping to banter and educate, further enriching the experience. Also the food is killer. Not even just for a pub. Straight killer.  Ace in the hole? Hole in one? The Hole package?  Choose your own cheesy closer, I cannot care what you think of my yelps, I'll be at the Hole in the Wall."}
{"text":"Great little spot to meet up for a drink. Emphasis on little! Great atmosphere and good, unique bits to eat."}
{"text":"Went in with my wife and 2 friends. It's very much a hole. Long and narrow but just as a bar should be.   We'd already eaten but the menu looked delicious. My wife and friends had beer, snacks and oysters while I waited for Casey to make some delectable cocktails.  I love a place I can go to where you tell the bartender what you feel like and await their creations. We had a reasonable amount of drinks, ALL incredibly tasty and for a fair price.   Love the Hole. It's a great place to chill."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese was amazing!  Duck wings were great.  Skip the smoked salmon tart (that was nothing special).  I'd honestly come back here just to eat the mac and cheese again... my god it was out of this world."}
{"text":"It's one of my favourite places in the city. Great food great music great staff (always so accommodating). Theyll recognize you and know if you frequent the bar. I love this place always well taken care of here."}
{"text":"Just realized after two visits and thinking the yummy-ness was second to none that the St Ambroise gives me the ...bathroom needs!"}
{"text":"The first review with one star must have been referring to an earlier incarnation. As of 2012 this place is cozy, beautifully redone and has 8 great beers on tap. (porter,"}
{"text":"You will never see place like this, good food local beer and local musicians. Its really relaxing casual atmosphere. They have oyster nights for a $1... Fill up."}
{"text":"Great place. Hard to get spot. Realy good food. I'm sure it is one of the best place in the junction"}
{"text":"Great food, great live music, great drinks! The only down fall is that the bar truly is a \"hole in the wall\" it can get very cluttered here on a Friday/ Saturday.   Friendly Staff"}
{"text":"I have never written a bad review in my life. I was so disappointed from my experience here, I would never recommend it to anyone. The customer service is horrible and disgraceful. It was a Saturday night, the band playing was the only cool thing about that place. The waiters were rude and inattentive. When we asked for a recommendation from the drink menu - they seemed annoyed that we would even ask. We ordered our first round (since we came all the way from the east end of Toronto to try this place - since thr reviews were pretty good) and asked for the bill immeditaley. They never came back with the bill, to the point that I had to get up and ask if I could pay at the bar. It was very obvious that I was not happy with the service. I left a $0.00 tip."}
{"text":"I'm picky about food and I like this place.   Fun drinks. Knowledgable staff. Always a good time."}
{"text":"Warm, inviting unpretentious. Love this place. Food is fantastic.  And so are the bands. Fave place in the junction for me. It is hip yet it feels like I am in some neighborhood pub in Britain. Very friendly.  Love the vibe and decor.  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"37$ for the worst coffee and the most boring huevos rancheros in the world should've went home.. 5$ for mud coffee bla. Service was dismissive at best. Eating out in Toronto is getting sad.."}
{"text":"After having weak drinks with dinner nearby and coming close to our 2 hour table time allocation, we decided to hit up THITW for what we hoped would be proper drinks.  This place did not disappoint.  It has the ambiance of a very small local bar. I lived it.  And the bartender was very nice. We were dressed up so sort of stood out, but we were treated very well. I know this sounds basic....but you would be surprised.   The drink menu had many classics, and were very well made which earns 4 stars.  While we were there, I have to admit, even though I was full from an earlier dinner, I was having some food envy. I saw beef ribs and what looked to be duck wings....and they looked amazing! Next time I will be coming here to try some of the food!"}
{"text":"Long and narrow bar with an intimate feel. Great locals and has live bands weekly with great music. Haven't tried any of the food but the drinks are in abundance and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots!  charming, bohemian, great food, good prices gotta get the caesar beer  and order a bunch of things-chances are you'll like most of them Only problem is it fills up quick guess my review aint gonna help ;("}
{"text":"Went for late night eats in the Junction and their kitchen was open until 1 which was perfect. Great atmosphere! Solid food!! And excellent draft selection. The \"spicy Chinese takeout\" calamari (I think that was the name) was really flavourful. The baked artichoke dip was delicious. And the fries were good. Nice touch that the condiments offered (without asking) were ketchup and a tasty hot sauce. I will come back again for sure!  Live band was playing and every seat was occupied. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local joint.  Great drinks, food and atmosphere.  Friendly staff and interesting choices of live music make it a great place to always come back to."}
{"text":"Went here on direction  from the staff at the Farmhouse Tavern, since it was booked up when we arrived. For first impressions it's very dark inside when coming in on a sunny afternoon, but when adjusting it's a nice, rustic looking atmosphere. I ordered the Boar Belly and others ordered the cod sandwich and burger. The Boar Belly was super good, like melt in your mouth. The fries were really good too. The star was probably the house made bbq chips though!  For dessert we got the huckleberry and sasparilla panacotta, and a chocolate lava cake. The lava cake was good, but the panacotta was probably the best I've ever had!  All this being said, it was a hefty 30+minute wait for our food, and we kept having to flag the server down when we needed something since he mostly hung around the bar. Minus one star for those things.. so if you're starving.. I would advise against coming here. I found it was worth the wait though, and I'll be back another time."}
{"text":"Fun little joint, worth dropping in for a pint and see what the band is playing. That is all I experienced in the time(s) I was here. Love the Junction."}
{"text":"THITW is a favourite of mine. It is the perfect hidden gem for an intimate date or drinks with a friend. It's a small cozy space hidden in the Junction. Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The space has high ceilings with gorgeous lighting, a big rustic bar lines the west wall and although narrow, the space is pretty long. At the end there is a spot for the live band to play, which is always great to watch but sitting close by makes it impossible to hear anything else.  They have a nice selection of whiskey and I've heard great things about their buck-a-shuck oysters, definitely need to make it out one of these nights to try them out!"}
{"text":"Very cozy pub/bar in the junction area with a very long bar and decent beer options on tap!  Roast beef with cider fresh from tap was so awesome!"}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed given high rating for this place.  This place runs in a long narrow hall, with unique/cozy decor, buck-a-shuck oysters on Tuesday's and a good selection of beer on taps....and that's about all in terms of pros.  For cons - to start, the service was EXTREMELY underwhelming.  They seemed to be snobby wannabe hipsters that are out there to judge you.  We are a group of 3, but only the two of us came first so we sat by the bar with 1 seat to our left.  First thing the server said was \"Hi, but I might need to move you later\", without even checking first whether that other seat was ours.  Then our server was impossible to find to order food, order drinks, follow-up on our orders and to get our bill.  And when we got our bill, he mistakenly charged us for a drink we didn't have, and gave us some half ass apology for the extra charge.  Food was very mehh also - we ordered the duck wings and they were tough as rubber, and the sauce tasted burnt.  Also got the trout served two ways and it was ok - but nothing memorable.  Lastly - we got this cooked apple in some IPA beer foam for dessert, recommended by the server, and it was soOOOO gross.  It was sour, mushy, and in some stale beer foam that none of us wanted to eat after the first bite.  Everything was quite pricey given the small portions - the bill came to $125 for 3 people.  The oysters was their only redemption, but honestly, it's raw and all you gotta do is shuck em.  So Koodos to their supplier for fresh oysters.  It was also cramped af - but I guess that's why it's called a hole in the wall.  Don't think I'll be coming back - If I wanna go to a hole in the wall, I can definitely find a lot of dingy cramped corners that serve better food at cheaper prices with friendlier and more attentive staff elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance -  rustic, woodsy and cozy! Really tiny so it's not good for large groups. I'm told they frequently have live bands. Quaint craft beer selection. Absolutely loved the food! It's a pretty simple menu. We had the burger added bacon and cheese and my bf loved it. Full of flavour and juicy. I had the pork pita sandwich which was good. The highlight was the Mac and cheese.... A little steep for a small ramekin at first sight, but it was worth every bite! Definitely will be back!  Oh yea, my only complaint was that my double Caesar cocktail didn't have the horseradish that I've seen pictured so beautifully!"}
{"text":"Cozy, good food, really good Bourbon Sour.  Friday night, we went early.  Seated by 5:00, and this place was almost full.  The Hole in the Wall is a very tight little space.   Our drinks were very well made.  We had spiced nuts before our meal.  The spice was not hot, it was more like a sweet and spicy.  I had the BLT, my friend had the burger.  Both came with fries.  No complaints here.  Very good food.  We will go back one night to catch the live entertainment.  I would recommend The Hole in the Wall to anyone that wants a night out without breaking the bank.  The interior is worth a visit."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer* I work nearby in the neighbourhood. I'm at the Hole pretty often, and have never had a bad time. Amazing service, great cocktails, beer list that covers just about all needs, and great food. Live music 6 days a week is always exactly what makes the atmosphere flawless. Can't say enough great things about this Gem of Toronto. So much love."}
{"text":"The bar is ok. The bartender, however would not stop whistling along with the music. So annoying."}
{"text":"This oasis in the Junction is the best bar that neighbourhood has to offer in my opinion.  Friendly staff.  Great macro beer selection included a cask from time to time.  Check their twitter feed for when the next cask will be opened.  Their food is also really good.  We can't get enough of their gnocchi.   So if you want a delicious pint, great atmosphere and friendly staff, go to The Hole in the Wall.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This tiny junction spot is literally a Hole In The Wall. The doorway is so hidden and non descript that even my DC (a junction local) nearly walked right past it.  Once inside, like many tiny Toronto resto establishments, it's long and narrow, creating a demand for their cocktails and comfort food by limiting space. It's kind of nice \"making it\" into a place like this while others stand at the door and wait. BUT before I get too cocky, the only way we were able to grab a seat was because we accepted a spot side by side at the bar.  The spot was kinda cool, I loved the minimalistic decor and the original stained glass high above the bar. Service at the bar was enthusiastic, friendly and super informative - I think I've decided that they keep the coolest servers behind the bar without realizing it. He made some solid reccos from the menu and we decided on the following.  Fried Spicy Calamari $10 - fairly standard, nothing too over the top. Hit the mark  Korean Wings $12 - A MUST have when visiting, so many sticky sweet flavours you commonly don't get on wings.  Cheese Macaroni $6 - AWESOME. Stick to my ribs delicious. So much melty gooey cheese. Comfort food should all taste like this  Old Fashioned $10.62 - This was a fair OF, not the greatest, and a little heavy on the alcohol and ice. Definitely drinkable, just not my fave  Sawdust City Kolsch $6.41 - My DC seemed to enjoy her pint quite a bit, even mentioned how easy drinking it was and how well it went with her meal.  As you can see, prices are pretty good here, and with so many of the dishes being offered as tapas style shares this is a pretty cool date spot IMO. Only points lost were the small size (however some would find it endearing) and for my cocktail. Otherwise will return again - hungry!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"A great place to hang out in the Junction, I have not tried the food yet but I ordered their stout and it was a solid and very tasty beer."}
{"text":"Small menu but really good food - great bar selection with a lot of spirits & beers I hadn't seen before. Friendly & knowledgeable servers."}
{"text":"Came here for buck-a-shuck oysters on (Tuesdays from 5-10pm). Good value, but understandably, the oysters were pretty small. Be prepared to wait awhile for the oysters. We also ordered the Roasted Cauliflower which was tasty, but a bit expensive for what it was.   They had daily specials on the wall and a large list of alcoholic beverages making it a great place to hang out after work. Helps that parking outside is free after 4pm too!   Definitely lives up to it's name as it's a bit easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. Hipster vibe complete with tasteful decorations and live music on some nights.   Would love to return to try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Great service, small but very well laid out, great beer selection! One of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"After standing for 10 minutes at the front door, not very busy, waiting to speak to a \"host\" the bartender glancing at me and continuing to chitty chat with a patron finally comes up to me. Take reservations or just walk ins? He replies only walk ins but how many are you going to be and when? So you do take reservations??? Pffffffffft A bit too hipster for my liking."}
{"text":"Great little spot with amazing 1860s style decorations, friendly staff , nice regulars and a good bourbon and scorch selection.  Can get really packed as its so small but that is part of the charm. Came here on Friday night and had two delicious bourbons which I haven't seen at the LCBO."}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday at 9pm and it was packed! Didn't get a drink there so I can only comment on the atmosphere. Its of small, narrow and deep shape and the crowd gave it a very cozy feel. The crowd are 90% around 30 years old professionals. This is a good place that you should come with friends, not by yourself."}
{"text":"So, this is a small place, no reservations, in the Junction. We landed early, around 6:30, and in short order were able to snag a booth for the three of us. Soon after we arrived the flow through the front door was steady and people had long waits, or had to leave. Long waits are worth it, though, because this place is super fun and the food is great. No pretense here. Just a friendly, neighbourhood spot. The cocktails were awesome. There is a solid wine list, a lot of beers to choose from, and one of the lengthiest Scotch lists I have ever seen. Three of us split the grilled broccoli, the Spicy Chinatown Calamari and the Potato and Smoke Cheddar Croquettes to start. These three dishes were superb. We moved on to split the duck wings. Crispy was good, but a bit on the dry side. For mains my husband had the Curry Slaw and Chicken dish, which was beautiful (see photos), but a bit heavy on the mayo for sure. My friend and I split the Steak Frites, which unfortunately arrived cold and our wine was far behind. BUT.....the dish was good. So here is what I would say. This place is really fun, with a great vibe. The food is amazing, and worth some wait times. But...there is a little room for improvement on the service. It's really slow, which is not great for them because they could have gotten even more drink revenue from us, and could have turned our table a lot faster. We saw three or four people throughout our meal, but only one, apparently, was allowed take an order, and since it was really busy, that meant we waited a very long time for everything, and timing was off. Food arrived colder than it should have, and drinks lagged behind the food. Having said all that, this is still a highly worthy eatery, but in a city with a lot of choices, I just hope they solve the serving problem, and maybe it's as simple as a host at the door."}
{"text":"My favourite place in all of Toronto. It has become a weekly visit. The food is delicious, the booze list is great and their staff are all top notch! I constantly look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Good place in junction. Kinda small but nice and unique selection of beers, the burgers are pretty good. I think they do karaoke or live band sometimes."}
{"text":"I had read lots of positive things about this small bar, and was excited to grab a drink here. Well, I didn't realize just how small of a small bar it actually is... Not many tables to choose from. The decor is fine, and our waiter was very nice. But it seemed to be an average beer selection with average prices. And it did feel a bit too small for my liking.  As for the live music it hosts, I would have been curious to see how a band could possibly fit on their tiny stage in the back! Probably would have been entertaining to see. But apparently 8pm on a Saturday is not the time to catch live music here...."}
{"text":"This is a very chill spot for drinks and snacks. Amazing beer list and the Spicy Chinatown Calamari is so good!!! Ambiance and lighting was on point. Bless this spot."}
{"text":"Thank goodness to exist HITW!  Many must have walked past a million times but never knew it was even there.  It's a cozy inviting neighborhood bar with a really interesting eclectic menu that changes weekly.  Good local brews, great service, and live music at night.   It offers a great ambiance, and the kind of exclusivity that really makes you feel like a local.   The drinks are astounding, and the food is rich, and hearty.  The price point is a little high, but sometimes it's worth the value and let's be honest, it's just nice to spoil yourself from time to time."}
{"text":"The Hole In The Wall is exactly its name. It's a dimly lit, narrow and cozy bar with a good selection of sharable dishes. I've been here a number of times, usually to sip on some beers on a Friday or Saturday night. We've also tried some dishes like the curried chicken slaw (good portion for 2), burgers and calamari. The food is tasty and satisfying. The service is also good, considering how busy this place can get. Since it's a small and busy space, you may have to wait for seats especially if you're a bigger group. Overall, I'd consider THITW as a reliable spot to have good food and drinks if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was excellent. Drinks were so good! Rose gin fizz would have to be my favorite. Our bartender was amazing and attentive. I will come back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a good drink and live music. Great place for couple. Don't miss Rosée d' hibiscus beer from Quebec."}
{"text":"I was really feeling this place from the moment we got there. I love the hidden entrance and the narrow room with unique and tasteful decor. I almost felt like I was in Harry Potter, it has so much character and mystery! The service was great, very friendly waiter. We both got the burger and beer deal - for $14! Such a steal and very delicious! The burger had an awesome sauce on it that kind of reminded me of Big Mac sauce but better! I want to be a regular here! Great vibe :)"}
{"text":"Everything hole in the wall is awesome!!  From food to music to ambiance.  Period."}
{"text":"A dependable local meeting place for drinks and food!  The atmosphere at Hole in the Wall is reliably comforting, complete with exposed brick, candle light and an awesome local draft beer selection.  The food is always tasty, be it dinner OR weekend brunch. They have daily specials that are very reasonably priced, and it's clear that everything is made using fresh, local ingredients.  And, on Tuesdays, they have buck-a-shuck oysters. Decent oysters, not the tiny, briny malpeques that are about to turn funky.   What's not to love?"}
{"text":"New owners! So the first review doesn't really apply anymore.  FANTASTIC food, great beer, great lighting and friendly staff. Try their one-off casks - something new all the time."}
{"text":"Since moving to the west end many years ago, Hole has always been one of my favourites. Whether you're here on a date (and I've had many first ones here!) or coming on a Saturday night to dance in the crammed back, the atmosphere is just perfect. Low, warm lights, fantastic drinks and an always-changing menu make it the perfect spot.  True to its name, it is mighty small so don't come with a group of 8 thinking you'll get a table.  As I'm writing this, I have to add one more gushy compliment to Hole: Casey, the bartender. Calling him a mere bartender doesn't make him justice. He is a mad chemist who knows exactly how to mix his potions and make the best cocktails in the city, second to none. If you're there on a quieter night (which is rare these days), ask him to make you something off the menu. I've never been disappointed when I did so."}
{"text":"Awesome little place. The food was really good, and the people were friendly and accomodating. A little small though so don't head over with a big group!"}
{"text":"The best ambiance. Live music, candles, communal tables all around in addition to little couple spaces. The bartender is incredibly friendly and easy to talk to, and most of the people there seem to be frequent customers. It's a strange area to be in just because I am  someone who's used to chain restaurants and busy streets, but it was a nice experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I haven't had the food but it's a really cool looking bar.  The old location was bit more rough looking but had lots of soul.  I think little bit of the soul is lost now because the music is meh.  Last time I went they were playing Pearl Jam or something...I like the band but I'm so done with my high school days, cover bands and want something new and fresh.  I hear the food is really good.  The interior decor is and always has been amazing but it feels more like the clean beaches vibe inside rather than the Junction I remember."}
{"text":"Cool place to check out in the junction. It's literally a hole in the wall the place is really narrow but absolutely cute. Was recommend to try the burgers and it wasn't bad. Wasn't the best ever but I wasn't asking or looking for that. The drink menu is extensive with different  price points. Would go back again."}
{"text":"One of the best bars/restaurants in Toronto! Its small, but really special! amazing staff, amazing food!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend for Saturday brunch. The place is tucked into an alcove, and I walked by at least twice before I found it - literally a hole-in-the-wall kind of place!  When I went it was midday so they didn't have many lights on and instead we got some natural light from the skylight above the bar.  I had the sweet waffles which were perfect - fluffy with a cactus pear purée over them and topped with pomegranate seeds. The waffle itself was sweet but the fruit was tart and it was a good combination. It was one whole waffle and very large.  My friend had the eggs benny which was a large portion as well.  The ambiance was dark (expected because it was a bar) and shabby-trendy. It was easy to get a brunch seat but it was still constantly busy. Wait staff were very kind.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! Had a little communication problem when I ordered my burger the other night over the phone . It didn't come the way I had ordered it so I sent a , not as polite as I usually am, email at midnight. Letting them know I was displeased . Next morning an email arrived, letting me know that they were sorry I had received the wrong order and to please return for a burger on the house. That they would let all the bartenders know.  Today I brought a girlfriend by to have lunch and the one who answers my email was there.   He comped my girlfriends burger as well and mine. We paid for 2 lovely mimosas and left a nice tip. This is the best customer service , retention and loyalty , always professional . LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This is a trendy bar. Dark, personal vibe. Cramped area. Seat yourself. Bar tenders were very nice. I got the burger and fries. The burger was pretty good. The bun is heavy. The fries weren't the best I've ever had, but they were good. I got the Rose Gin Fizz drink for $14. Pretty good."}
{"text":"I like weird, unusual, creepy old buildings (sometimes ppl too). There is something mysterious in this place. For instance, the semi open bizarre lil door located in front the entrance gave me the chills when I accidentally sighted that way.  The ceilings are tall, the furniture is rustic and looked comfortable. At least the bar's chairs were wide and cozy. I couldn't stop looking around to all those bizarre decorations.   The Hole in the Wall is narrow (not in the mind), gothic tall, anaconda long, and an excellent stop to have a nice meal, party, or conversation.  The multitasking guy who seemed to run the joint welcomed us; asked how many we were, attended the bar, complimented my choice of Alvarinho, brought the tapas, and charged the bill (he was not only active but also attentive and inviting).  The bread with the duck fat reminded me those the grandpa would cook for Heidi. Although it sounds gross I liked it better than butter, and the quality of the bread was good too.  The calamari was excellent: 100% recommendable.  The potatoes were lacking seasoning. The consistency was perfect, but nothing remarkable.  The oysters were fresh, chubby, and perfect with a glass of alvarinho. I also tasted the Californian one: fruity-fresh.  We waited around 25 min on a Friday but it was worth."}
{"text":"$1 oyster Tuesdays - say no more!  This is a cool little place that's very long and narrow inside.  The place just filled up as I arrived around 630p.  Luckily, they found a couple of spots at the bar for us after a few minutes.  Probably not a good place for big groups given these circumstances. They have a great selection of craft beer on tap.  Their oysters were good and I also enjoyed the duck wings!  Roasted Cauliflower $11 - These were okay, has a curry flavor to them.  Buffalo Duck Wings $14 - These are a must have!  The sauce on these duck wings are sweet and savory.  Spicy Calamari $12 - Lightly batter in delicious Szechuan sauce.  Street parking on Dundas is free on weekdays after 6p.  It was easy parking right across the street when I came for dinner on a Tuesday night.  There are also paid parking lots nearby.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"We found this place in yelp and went on a Friday night. The drink menu is my fav. We ordered duck wings which was juicy and tasty. The atmosphere is also one of the significant feature with a live music on Friday nights. Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch menu and coffee.  The Hole in the Wall has quickly turned into my favourite brunch place in the Junction. I've eaten through most of the menu (though it changes regularly), and every item has been delicious from Full English, to Huevos Rancheros and duck confit poutine. Fresh, well seasoned-consistently scrumptious.   The staff is always charming, engaged and knowledgable, and they are now serving great coffee from La Crema down the road.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really cool decor and love the slightly hidden entrance. Their beer selection is amazing with about 16 on tap and (somehow) an even cooler bottle selection!  Food menu seemed limited but all interesting items. I went on a Sunday so was able to have their roast beef dinner which was very, very good. Best yorkshire pudding I have had!  Service was fine but not overly friendly or welcoming which is the only think that takes away from 1 star here."}
{"text":"This place was SO LOUD with the live band playing that we didn't end up staying for the food. So this will be a review of the acoustics in this tiny strip of a pub. Because this space is so tiny (it was basically a hallway), the sound was overwhelmingly loud because there was no way to get out of the direct line of the sound, and no space to diffuse it."}
{"text":"First time I've been disappointed here! 1- two other tables were here after us but got their food before us 2- maybe that's why our food was cold 3- our server free poured my double Caesar. Not a fan of not knowing how much alcohol I'm ingesting. Plus I couldn't taste any vodka.  4-asked for greens as well as potatoes. The greens were a vinegary slaw. Yuck.   $53 without tip. For the first time not worth it.   Now waiting for bill as server chats with the more efficient server and checks her phone."}
{"text":"Comforting atmosphere and easy-going attentive staff. The beer menu has all of the craft staples (beau's, wellington, muskoka, etc). The food is also incredible. Weekly specials (dinner+pint) are great & well priced. The perfect bar to visit in the Junction, whether it's for a date or with a group of friends.."}
{"text":"Probably the most aptly named bar in Toronto, and definitely one of my favourites.   There's live music 5 days/week, and open mic on Mondays. They've been around for something like 15 years, and it shows. Every part of the operation is really polished: great service, solid menu, and decent beer selection. Really, if you're in the Junction and feel like something a little more authentic than the Indie Ale House across the street, it's probably your best bet."}
{"text":"As tourists, we didn't know that the Monday after the New Years weekend would mean that many restaurants and bars closed. So having this place be unintentionally planned after driving to three closed bars on our to-do list, I immediately felt bad that it wasn't even our first choice after doing some research on the food and bars of Toronto!   When I walked in, the bartender greeted me near the door with enthusiasm and led me to my seat. There was a girl performing in the back of the bar with her ukulele, and probably about 5-6 people drinking near the entrance. The place was dead, but the bartender still managed to keep a great attitude as our host and even made great conversation! He recommended 4-5 more bars and clubs for us to visit and even described the type of live music that was to be played there. I admit the cocktail I ordered (something with Rosemary) felt kind of weak (this was my first bar that night too) but the food was DELICIOUS. I ordered the veggie burger, while my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese. At first I thought it may have been typical boxed mac and cheese, but when I tried his dish, I was so jealous at how rich the cheese was, warm and melted all over the pasta. My veggie burger was great too, I could even see the pieces of veggies in my patty, so that's always a plus for me. Great fresh food, great live music, and best customer service I could ever ask for!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Small and cozy. Very tasty food and comprehensive list of drinks and well-made cocktails. Been for brunch, dinner, snacks and many times for \"just drinks\", too. Good, straightforward staff.    Buck-A-Shuck on Tuesdays is A1."}
{"text":"The coolest, best bar in the the Junction.   Very long and very narrow, with a perfectly warm and inviting interior.  Outstanding beers on tap, almost all local.  Pretty good food, esp the tostada (vegetarian).   HOWEVER, there is not enough staff at busy times to support the number of guests.  Two servers for 50 people is insufficient.  The other night I waited 20 minutes to have my $ taken so I could pay and leave, and saw another guest who had to get up and snare the server to ask for her bill.  Until and unless they fix that issue I am staying away.  Just visited again last night (Monday Nov 22 2016) despite the above, and had my favourite dinner there ever- a special of pan seared trout w veg and a side order of mashed potatoes ($22 total).  The usual staff I've had (let's call them 'short guy' and 'taller guy') were not there and the service was excellent, even when it got, inevitably I guess even for Monday, busy.  Signs of improvement?"}
{"text":"cool looking place, fine selection of beers, great food, friendly staff and good music!"}
{"text":"Key lime pie pairs surprisingly well with bourbon. Service here is exceptional."}
{"text":"had brunch today,  best in recent memory!  smoked trout eggs benedict with potatoes trout  mild, smooth moist healthy portion eggs plump runny sauce slightly zingy and yummy muffin soft potatoes!! the perfect combo of oily moistness and crunch lightly seasoned music:,the Avett brothers on CD folksy guitar and banjo blue grassy fiddles and harmony super nice servers big mug of hot coffee  my neighbourhood bar THITW  Ben and  Casey always know our drinks, my kid is welcomed here serve craft beer and cider, Junction brewery and Toronto Distillery secret tip: 5-7 pm food and pint special $14 during the week. wed burger fries and hand crafted pint for $14?! burger rivals any $20 ' gourmet' sandwich in town.  live music later at night no cover but pls put something in the pitcher"}
{"text":"Of course as the name suggests, a hole in the wall.  A good place to for a drink or two and some food.  They have a pretty extensive drink/beer menu.  Their specials located on the chalk board at the front are pretty cheap - saw lots of options for under $7.  We ordered for the table - duck wings (they were pretty big) and the curried slaw with smoked chicken.  I didn't try the duck wings so I can't comment on that but my friends licked the bones clean so it must have been good.  I did enjoy the curreied slaw and smoked chicken - it's a cold chicken dish that really light and flavourful and the slaw gives it a nice crunch.  It's actually a fair amount of food - and there are actually pieces of chicken in here!  This place has an old school feel - it's got that large vintage looking chandeliers, low lighting, dark furniture.  I'm sure this would be a bar where everyone would know your name.  It also does brunch - which by the other reviewers seem to be a big hit.  I'd definitely come back here to try the brunch if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I like a lot. I don't have anything bad to say about this!!!! Except for the fact that my newly found favorite beer (the one I discovered at Barhop - Side Launch) is no longer a wheat ale?!!?!?! WTF. It's not Hole's fault :( but I was sad until the food came.  Prices were great, we ordered two beers, a bourbon? whiskey? brown alcohol that fancy people drink with ice. Then we got mac and cheese, duck confit (3 duck legs in buffalo-ish) sauce. I didn't really like the duck, it was a little dry and the sauce was just straight up buffalo sauce you get on wings, but I don't think this fine establishment deserves to get stars taken away from them because of that. I think it's just my personal preference...I'm feeling generous today. I don't recommend them.   GET THE BURGER! And then tell me about it because everyone seemed to be ordering it and they carried it past us and I was drowning in saliva....it was bad. Smells absolutely delicious.   Tuesday was also Buck a Shuck!! So we loaded up on oysters. They were just oysters, fresh and decent sized. With lemon and fresh radish. I recommend!!  I also definitely recommend the mac n cheese!!!! I wish I knew how to make this at home....I love it, it was cheese and delicious. Unfortunately a) i'm really meh about pastas and b) Prohibition Gastrohouse STILL has my heart in the Mac department.  I really liked the atmosphere, I would definitely come again!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Friday night and it was packed. Tiny, cozy pub with limited seating options.  Was not a big fan of the atmosphere - a little too dark, loud and crowded. The food however was awesome. Highly recommend the roasted cauliflower and calamari, some of the best I've had in the city.  Staff are very nice but busy."}
{"text":"I come here way too often for a drink or for food. First, it really is a hole in the wall - and so you'd expect a dive bar. But this is not a dive bar. If you expect to dive bar like food, or save a bit of money for some cheap drinks - sorry, you're out of luck.   What you can expect here is some great food. There is always some duck or special menues. The veggie burger, was new, and just was very well made - like a piece of art. Calimari, I always find fried to perfection. Drinks, are like many places in the junction and at market price. I don't really recall any special drinks.  I've been for their English breakfast, and it has been a rather wonderful meal with a good price. The servers always take care of you even if they are extremely busy.   So is this place for getting trashed under 20 dollars? No. But for a reasonable budget of 40 dollars, you can get a 2-3 drinks and good snack/meal. The place is tiny, so don't bother on a weekend with more than 4 people unless you're you come really early."}
{"text":"THITW is a great ambient spot for a casual yet cozy meal or grabbing a drink with friends. The food was unique, quickly prepared, and decently priced - though nothing special. The portions are slightly too small for one dish per person - my date and I shared two entrees and an appetizer for $37 and it was the perfect amount.   The service was sub-par as we had to wait 10 minutes to pay our bill, and our waiter seemed to be in a rush all the time. However, loved the atmosphere and true \"hole-in-the-wall\" vibe. They also have $1 oysters on Tuesdays which I will check out next time."}
{"text":"Was really pleasantly surprised by this place! The outside is of course endearing in its ability to be so well hidden, but stepping inside is so unlike any other restaurant like it I've seen in this city. Stained glass above the bar, skylights, old wood everywhere, and everything smells like oaky red wine. I'm typically pretty wary of these hipster places for both ambiance and food, but the music was a reasonable volume, the service was decent, and the food was fantastic. The food menu is small, but I'm fairly picky and I was torn between so many  things. I ended up with the Spatz & Cheese which was so delicious! Served with an egg yolk to mix in, and definitely left me happy. And if you want a drink, the drink menu goes on for 12 pages longer than the food. We didn't get one - instead we wanted tea, but apparently they don't service any hot drinks. Seems a bit odd. Overall can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I didn't like this place very much. Very small space and servers are always busy. They only have craft beer which wasn't to my liking either"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night snack and drink and were so glad we found ourselves here. Awesome vibe, live music. The late night menu is short but the burger was amazing, and the Cuban too. The cocktail I had was well made, and of course they have Junction beers on tap."}
{"text":"Have now had the food! Highly recommend the  oysters- delicious and extremely fresh, served on a platter of ice with the perfect accompaniments- lemon, tabasco and most importantly- horseradish.    Also, tried the mussels. There was a 12$ special for a huge plate of mussels and a pint, with toast. Very very good deal! Steaming hot, flavourful and with a rich but still light white wine cream sauce, and the toast was perfect to dip- melt in your mouth. Very fresh- and serve quite late- 11 or 12 ish! Love THITW"}
{"text":"Dear The Hole in the Wall,  I like you. I like your location amid all the great restaurants in The Junction. I like your obscure entrance that leads into your narrow, cozy space.  I like your bartender who served me just a bit too much Jameson, which resulted in my missing my flight back to America the next morning.  The $75 that I had to pay Porter to catch a later flight was totally worth it.  Hope to see you soon.  xoxo me"}
{"text":"The best staff. The best atmosphere. The best beer. The best food.   Where everywhere else in the Junction closes early and is unreliable the hole is a good friend you can count on. So glad to have it in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Step 1: Find bar.  It's not as hard to find as Cold Tea, as there is at least a sign; however, it is pretty easy to walk past.  Step 2: Order a drink.  The cocktail list is pretty rocking.  I enjoyed a rather delicious tequila cocktail with a strawberry balsamic shrub.  It's not the #1 cocktail program in the city, but it's in my top 10, maybe top 5.  The beer list is pretty underwhelming..they have some microbrews but none of the interesting ones.  Step 3: Attempt to order food.  We got off to a pretty slow start with service.  I got my own cocktail at the bar.  Eventually we got some attention and managed to get our food ordered.  The waitstaff are friendly and fun, but 3 people to bartend, take food orders, food run, bus, and play host just ended up spread a bit to thin.  The burger was quite tasty...not in competition with the Emerson or BarHop, but a solid offering.  The calamari was also pretty good...perhaps just a bit over-fried.    OVERALL, I was pretty happy with this place and would definitely return.  The ambiance was often, the cocktails were good, and the service was good when you got it.  A burger, a cocktail, a beer, and some shared apps ran to a bit under $40 with tax & tip."}
{"text":"After coming here a gazillion times, I have to update my review.  Yes, it gets crowded here.  Yes, the service can lag at times because the layout of the place is quite tough.  Yes, you can't easily predict when it will be so crowded you can't move  However....   1. They have damn good food. If you want to skip the super crowded late nights , you should come here around 630 or 7 for great food. Not only do they have great burgers, they are always trying new things that go beyond bar food. In fact, their specials could easily be served at any restaurant in town. The other night I had a beef rib plate that was sensational.  2. Great musical acts here. They have a schedule they usually post on line.  3. Great mix of people. Yes, it is hipster, but it is also neighbourhood as well. The neighbourhood crowd adds to the diversity of the place. It balances \"scene\" and \"friendly\" well.  4. Cold, regional beers. No big name beers on draught, just a solid variety of awesome beers from around Ontario.  5. The staff are generally friendly and give great suggestions. You can tell they appreciate what they do.  6. They also have a small wine selection along with endless cocktail options.  Hole in the Wall is an all around great place that has done a lot to help usher in positive transformation in The Junction."}
{"text":"This place is great. Intimate, cozy and delicious.  Ordered the artichoke dip - probably the best of its kind that I've had.   Veggie burger was amazing. My dining companion had the Philly steak. He was quite satisfied. All in all a good experience, with good food and good service. Second visit and would definitely revisit for their oyster special."}
{"text":"1.  Simply put, The Hole In The Wall is the perfect neighbourhood local.  Killer cocktails, awesome craft beer selection and a nice cozy ambience.  There's a reason why people come in every night.  2.  Food - not what you'd expect, but exceptional.  It's high-brow fare, without the pretension, and the prices are very reasonable.  3.  Brunch - honestly, one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to.  Again, low on the pretension, high on the service and quality.  If you are in the Junction, this is where you want to go."}
{"text":"Late Saturday night found a friend and I hungry and in need of some serious food therapy. We stood outside in the cold for about a minute outside of Indie Ale House contemplating before opting to cross the street and check out THITW. I am so glad we did. We showed up at 10:15, at which point they were obviously operating at full capacity, and were able to get seated by 10:30. Sweet!  From the sunken in entrance-way to the long, narrow dining/bar area with a wall of exposed brick and groovy light fixtures, this place is just so rustic and home-y. The best way I can describe being here is like being wrapped in a big warm blanket and not wanting to get out of bed, ever. We got seated right at the back next to the fantastic live band and were taken care of diligently by some great, chill and friendly staff who obviously enjoy what they're doing. Being next to the band, it was occasionally too loud for conversation, but we were stuffing our faces for most of the time anyway. It was a nice treat.  After 10:30, they have a smaller menu to choose from, which disappointed my friend (she had her heart set on the mac 'n cheese) but the food we did end up eating was great all the same. I started out with the Singapore Sling to sip on while we decided on food. Not too sweet at all and refreshing, I almost ordered a second one before I remembered that I'm poor. Onto the noms!  We ordered the duck wing confit, calamari and veggie burger w/fries to share, and finished with the pot de creme. The wings were brushed with a typical buffalo sauce but were so tender and rich, successfully achieving melt-in-your-mouth status. The sauce was too hot for my friend (weakling), so I had two out of the three wings that come on the plate. We split the veggie burger and fries between the two of us. The patty itself was mostly made up of bean, quinoa and other goodies and was tad crumbly, but very appetizing. The toppings on the burger itself lent great flavor and my friend really enjoyed the sauce on it. I approve! The fries were pretty standard but good, we got the aioli dip for them and that was pretty tasty too.  The star of the meal was definitely the calamari though, and that is saying a lot coming from me. I suppose I've had a lot of bad squid in my lifetime, so until recently I've been pretty biased towards calamari. Eating at more reputable establishments lately has opened my eyes to a world of possibilities. We loved this calamari. The batter is light and has good crunch to it, the squid itself had a pleasant texture to it and the sauce. The sauce! It was some kind of spicy sweet concoction that had me trying to get as much of it onto my calamari as possible. I'm all about that sauce and sauces in general. Try this dish!  As if we weren't stuffed and rotund enough, we had to get dessert. They offered two options on the late night menu, and while I love me some cheesecake, we were set on that pot de creme. Garnished with walnut pieces, we ventured into layers of peanut butter-y and chocolate-y goodness. It didn't last long until it was all gone. I have no regrets, but I probably gained 10 pounds last night.   After paying our bill, it was a veritable struggle to get back to the car as we waddled along Dundas in the snow with our engorged stomachs. Laughing at anything became a struggle of trying to keep our food down, and we were basically on a food high, so that was no simple feat. To quote my friend, \"I just wanna keep this food down (whispers) because it was so good!\" It was one of the most desperate and hilarious moments I've recently had.  THITW offers everything I look for in an establishment. Great food and drink, great staff and service, comfortable and cozy atmosphere, not pretentious at all and just a great spot to hang out and feel good. Check it out if you haven't already. I will certainly be going back to try their larger dinner menu, although I might need someone to roll me out next time."}
{"text":"Didn't notice this place until last night. Oddly enough, it is a hole in the wall. And what a hole indeed. The drinks are delicious and expertly prepared, the ambiance isn't loud, it's a perfect little place. The bartender even made a drink not on the menu that went over really well, too. The jerky was the perfect snack food, too.   Amazing all around."}
{"text":"I'll just say up front that we were tourists in Toronto, we are not locals. When we travel we like to eat at local places not fast food or \"tourist vacuums\". So we listened to yelpers and headed towards this place because of the good reviews. While the two appetizers we got were REALLY good, I have to give 3 stars. I suppose it's my own fault for not reading reviews closely, but this is not what I was expecting. It is a tiny bar with snacks. It is not a restaurant type bar, so be warned. We went in around 4 on a Saturday and it was just kind of awkward. It is literally a hole in the wall place and when we walked in we really felt out of place. We tried some food anyway but kind of just wanted to get out of there.   Bottom line is this place seems to be for locals and I don't recommend it at all for tourists."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love this place.  I withhold one star only because I've yet to find a beer here that I like.  Otherwise, the hidden entrance, decor, laid back vibe, the dark atmosphere, food, and the clientele, are all things that draw me back."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been coming here with friends for the past 3 years. If you are vegan, you'll be easily accommodated here (unlike at Indie Ale House or 3030Dundas, where they just glare at you and give you major attitude as soon as you meekly whisper that you're vegan) , even if you don't see anything to your liking on the Hole in the Wall' menu, you will be pleasantly surprised with the service and excellent meal prepared just for you. Come here for great live music, always great service and well made drinks at the bar, you will be tempted to tip well :)"}
{"text":"The rancheros and hot sauce.  Amazing.  Will be back. Totally the best hidden gem.  I would suggest sitting at the bar, not in a booth.  The fan will make you nauseous and ruin your experience at the great space.    If you love hogwarts/ ol' English bars - this is your spot!"}
{"text":"The sweetest little hidden gem, great cocktails and would highly recommend for a date. The bartender suited the place as he had a unity look and was wearing a short sleeve dress shirt and tie, he was personable and definitely gave good recommendations (I wish I remembered his name)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The theme and layout is wicked, and that does a lot for a cozy place to grab a bite and/or just drinks.  The food was good and selection on tap was great!  Another one of those places you can easily frequent and not get bored. The area is not very large and as the name goes it's narrower than other resto-bars.  This place is unique and that makes it a place to change things up every now and then :)"}
{"text":"It was love at first sight.  I'm going to keep this short. This west end bar is literally a hole in the wall. The entrance is non descript, and can easily be missed. Once inside, it's long, narrow, and super rustic, with a perfectly warm and inviting interior. It was a weeknight, and it surprised me as how busy it was. Great vibe, with a great live band. I love live bands.  It was packed, but the staff still managed to be super sweet, and friendly. All in all, I was impressed and can't wait to come back. Did I mention, it's a great place to bring your date?!   For the drinkers, they have outstanding beers on tap, and an extensive selections of scotches, whiskeys, and wines.  Perfect little place.  Hours - Mon thru Sat 4pm - 2am, Sunday Brunch at Noon, Open till 2am Vegan - The Tostadas were delicious! Parking - Street"}
{"text":"Check out their selection of single malt whiskey. Impressive list. They have a rotating menu of specials. Unfortunately, I didn't try the food. Liked their beer and cocktail menu as well and nice atmosphere. It's mostly bar rail seating here, but there are some small 2 seater tables or a (single) 6 seater for when you're feeling chummy. Great place to grab a drink. My friend had a Pisco Punch, a variation of pisco sour. I had the Lugtread beer."}
{"text":"I have such a mixed feeling about this place. I really appreciated the overall charter the place had. The ambiance it provides is relaxing and intimate, the beer and wine selection are also great. The only issue I had was with the food and menu. It is my opinion that the menu doesn't describe the food well. The food was mostly very plain and not as good as I expected it to be. That is my reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came to Hole in the Wall for Buck a Shuck Tuesday's. Excellent service, great atmosphere, unique venue AND great oysters for the price!"}
{"text":"The Hole in the Wall is a venue in The Junction like no other.  First of all, it has a very easy to miss and very unique entranceway which I believe is perfectly synonymous with the venue's name.  When you enter you are greeted by a long and narrow space adorned with unique décor which goes quite some way in giving the place its character, along with the dim lighting, which also provides a fitting vibe and ambiance to a venue with such a layout.  I was so intrigued by my impression of the venue the 1st couple of times I visited (several years ago) that I didn't even consider it to be a place to eat - that was also due to my concentration on their beer selection, which has always been quite good every time I've been.  There's a bar in the venue's midsection and they have both booth seating and chairs and tables.  It's also a live music venue with a corner stage in the back.  I very recently made my 1st visit since my initial 2 visits years ago; again I was with 2 friends for drinks.  I hope to order food the next time I go; as far as I can recall, the service for drinks has always been fairly prompt. If you're in the area, haven't been and want to check out a quirky, small space give Hole in the Wall a try - and you might want to have the address handy in case you miss that entrance."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar that i'm jealous of because i don't live in the Junction."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were excellent. At first I thought it wasn't enough but then I started eating it and it was very filling. My partner ordered the Huevos Rancheros which was also delicious. We have also ordered the duck wings and meat and veggie platters which were great but small for sharing. The service here is ok. The food is great but the portion sizes are rather small. If you go at night the atmosphere and staff is fun and lively but during the day is quite the opposite. Dead.   I would go back...in the evening."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood with my girlfriend for shipping vintage stuff. When we became hungry, we decided to check out that hidden place at Dundas west. It was worth it. We ordered two waters and had the best veggie burgers in our lives. The side potatoes were crispy and well seasoned. It was a big portion but not too much. Awesome sauce on the burger, the Avocadoes were really good as well. The place is cute and very cozy, reminds me of some sweet little pubs in Ireland. The waitress was very nice and kind too"}
{"text":"The calamari was freakin amazing and I normally don't eat calamari. We had a late night drive into Canada and found this place with good music and friendly services.. we're from Los Angeles can't wait to eat here again"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure every community should have a Hole In The Wall... except then this one may lose some of its luster! Tucked away where one can easily walk by without seeing it (I did, several times in fact), HITW is a beacon for great cocktails, whiskeys and some delectable food. I have yet to catch it on a really busy night, but I look forward to doing so soon.   Ambience is great, staff are helpful and cheerful, and the volume is perfect for conversation. Oh and have I mentioned that the prices aren't half bad??  Definitely a new regular stop-in for me!"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks or food in the junction!  Just ask Casey to make you a cocktail you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just go here.  Food is unexpectedly good, for a bar, and the whiskey selection is right up my alley.  I love the ambiance here and we had great service.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, great food, great music and Beaus on tap. Can't go wrong !"}
{"text":"If the live music  Matches this superb pub cuisine ,drink hole in the wall , then it's a must go to return spot in the junction . Atmosphere plus  Maybe after your kids monkey vault romp or after you drop them off home!"}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews of The Hole In the Wall and having it bookmarked on Yelp for a couple months, I really wanted to love this place, but it didn't really do it for me.   For a bar with such an extensive drink menu, I thought our server would have made an effort to recommend his favourite drinks or highlight some of the specials.   To be honest, I didn't feel quite welcome at this establishment due to the service received. A smile or even a 'how are you?' would have been sufficient.   I will say the spatz and cheese was phenomenal! Very creamy and flavourful and was topped with an egg yolk.  My strawberry fields cocktail was good, but nothing to write home about, and quite pricey at $14.  The decor was beautiful - very cozy with the exposed brick wall and rustic feel.   Overall, a cozy place to grab some food or an expensive drink, but don't expect outstanding service."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night. Got lucky with seats at the bar. Great live music, chill vibe, and yummy food. Ordered the braised rib special, a perfect winter dish, and the mac and cheese, which was very cheesy and tasty.  We enjoyed ourselves that night and would definitely go back; however, the service stunk. The waiters and bartenders were not attentive at all, and the food took a noticeably long time to be prepared."}
{"text":"Perhaps it is because my group and I just survived the worst experience at 3030 Dundas that this was exceptional to us.  But perhaps not.  This please is a beautiful, quite literally hole in the wall.  It is set far into shared entrance.  There were warm candles set into the exposed brick walls, retro wood panelling, amazing rustic chandeliers, a long beautiful bar and a decent amount of seating, but much, but perfect.  The staff was insanely friendly and quick.  We ordered calamari and craft beer and watched the live east coast band.  It was a great night."}
{"text":"I enjoy the feel of this place. The lighting is great and the owners, which are the bartenders are very friendly!!    The beer list  is great but the cocktails are not consistently made. I think they need to beef up on the quality and the creativity of the cocktail list in order to attract a wider range of customers."}
{"text":"After coming here, I was definitely craving some more calamari and pot de creme. Unfortunately when I came back it wasn't quite as good. Actually, it was pretty bad. The calamari wasn't fried long enough, so it was soggy and chewy rather than crispy. Each bite taken was accompanied by disappointment, and I'm not the one to hide my expressions, so one my friends thought it was hilarious. The pot de creme was alright, the flavour was the same but it had a grainy texture, like the sugar didn't quite fully dissolve.  My friends got the cheesecake, which came with some burnt dulce de leche resembling clump on top, and the cheese and artichoke dip, which was more like cheese and grease dip.   What made it worse was the service. Oh my god, the service. There was one waiter and one buser, and we sat at the entrance. The waiter was too busy chatting with people around the bar that it was impossible to get any service. We had to wave him down for our bill via charades, then waited for the machine. I usually don't mind waiting but we waited just about over an hour to pay our bill, finally escaping the night of disappointment."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Had the lobster roll when I was here a while back, in love with the atmosphere and the staff are really amazing. Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Talk about being too cool for school. It won't hurt you gals to greet customers or ask them if they want a menu. I understand you only have 4 things on the menu but I would still like to take a look.  Nothing special about this place at all it's ur typical dark brick wall dive."}
{"text":"Since the first time i entered The hole in the wall (THITW) about 4 months ago, I have been here a handful of times and enjoyed every visit. Yesterday I brought some out of towners to THITW and like every other time, we all had a great time. The music is excellent, a very cool and blusey mix of tunes. The bartender was attentive but not too much so. The crowd was a nice mix of young and old, couples, grounds, singles. not pretentious at all. The ambiance of the place is this laid back cool feeling, i sort of feel like i'm transported back in time with the huge light fixtures and stained glass windows. It's a narrow and long bar but i think it adds to the charm and appeal.  There is a good beer list, and the drinks are pretty good as well. Food wise, it's all reasonably priced ($5-17) and much of it sounds great. i saw some tables eating oysters ($2 each i think), we had the calamari which was nicely fried but the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. they had mac and cheese for $6 so i'm going to have to try that next time. The bartender provided these KICK ASS homemade bbq potato chips and they were awesome. we love them. it was a great treat in between the 4th and 5th beer :) Overall, i am very happy to have this as my local watering hole."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the junction. As with all the new bars that have popped up, it has that hipster/brooklyn vibe ...but i really like it. Its narrow and the heavy wood decor makes for an intimate feel. Bartender and owner were quite friendly. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Long and narrow, and hidden away from the main street, they have an awesome beer and whisky selection and live music, and the food is stupendous!!  The only complaint I have is that it is often difficult to get a seat here, and it can get a little bit claustrophobic!  Otherwise, consider this my usual watering hole."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks, live music and conversation. Bar staff is always amiable and from what I remember, drinks are decently priced."}
{"text":"Good food, cool mood, kind of cramped. It had a very hipster vibe to it."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I know it may not be for everyone.  It's really warm and welcoming...more chill and no suits. People and staff are friendly. Great drinks and sometimes they have live bands in the little corner. Coolest, most eclectic washrooms too!   If you're looking for food other than bar food, look on the boards. The food is actually good! I had a steak last night and it was perfectly crusted and the shallot jus was delicious!  The wait time really depends on when you go. There have been times I've been seated immediately and others when I had to wait over 30mins."}
{"text":"I love Hole In the Wall.  Has to be one of my favorite places for drinks in the city.  The drink list is huge and they are exceptionally well made.  The food is delicious but it is the atmosphere that really makes it.  Narrow and very long, dimly lit and warmly appointed; it is deeply inviting and makes you want to linger.  I love the live music, even on week nights, that consistently hits the right tone with the ambiance and mood of the space.  Just writing this makes me want to pick up and go.  Fantastic spot."}
{"text":"Great place! It was a bit difficult to find a place for 4 people and service was so-so. But the food was delicious. We ordered Curried Slaw and Smoked Chicken, Tostada, Spatz and Cheese, and Buffalo Duck Confit Wings. Everything was so good, with the first 2 being our favorites of the group."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for a pint before dinner, but it was love at first sight.   The first thing I noticed when we walked towards it is that it literally is a little hole in the wall. It's set back off the street and I nearly missed it all together.   Once inside the decor is super rustic, has that old bar feel to it. They've got a bunch of scotches, whiskeys, etc on the wall and a pretty decent looking beer list.   I went with a Flying Monkey IPA, it was amazing. As usual, I'd never had it on tap before and it was really great.   The place was packed and it surprised me how awesome the service was. The staff were super friendly and generally pleasant to interact with.   I hear they have amazing food, so I will absolutely add this to my next time I'm in Toronto list.   If you haven't check it."}
{"text":"We are fortunate to have our sauce plant in The Junction (www.vasauces.com)which to our surprise when we moved in, houses some of the best food this city has to offer (at modest prices), HITW is no exception..the fried chicken is among the best I've ever had(Thomas Keller 's Adhoc in Yountville,CA still reigns supreme) with a hint of rosemary that cuts through the richness- it is sublime. If you're looking  for cozy, dark and secretive, his is the place for you. Not for tourists  accustomed to food courts at gas stations"}
