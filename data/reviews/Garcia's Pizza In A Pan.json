{"text":"I ordered a 9\" thick cheese pizza. It was probably a frozen crust, which was not a deep dish crust. The fact that it was not deep dish is not the issue, but the fact that the crust was just bad is an issue. The sauce and cheese were nothing special either, and certainly couldn't overcome the less-than-mediocre crust.  Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright doesn't beat papa dels or Rizzotti's. However the cleanliness of this place is unacceptable, extremely unorganized and the floors/ walls are terrible.  As for staff one guy was really nice and the must of been having a really bad day. 3 stars for the pizza 1 star for me actually debating eating the pizza because how dirty the place is."}
{"text":"My first date with my wife was a the Garcia's pizza in Normal, IL in 1979 near Waterson Towers.  I later found out that Garcia's closed in Normal when I was celebrating my 20th wedding anniversary.  We drove to Champaign and told them that we met 20 years earlier and they gave us our meal free for being so loyal.  I went to school at the U of I in Champaign and my wife went to school in Normal at ISU.  Garcia's have the best pizza outside of Chicago."}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING it truly is the Garcias of yesterday. The food is always fresh. Made with the finest quality ingredients the owner can buy. The employees are always friendly and helpful. You would think that you would have to wait along time for pizza but not at Garcias. The Baby Stuffed  pizzas for lunch are just out of this world. I have never had a bad experience there. So come on let's keep our local dollars local and support these guy's I mean they have been doing it for over 40 years they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"The Gut Buster is seriously the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Wasn't really good. Service was friendly enough and prompt. Food was so so and didn't seem like the cleanest spot in town. Better pizza restaurant options are out there."}
{"text":"The campus Garcia's has closed!  What a shame - it was in the coolest building!  I can't say I'm surprised though.  I can't remember the last time I was in there and wasn't the only customer.  Luckily, the one out on Mattis is still open."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely the last of a truly awesome restaurant.  As far as a wait that could happen there, but good things in life are often worth waiting for. In all actuality you have been waiting a long time, perhaps your whole life to try this Pizza!  The nostalgia of Garcia's is keeping this place alive, but so is the fact that they make a product that you can't get anywhere else. There are some very unique qualities to their pizza.  First the Baby Stufft. It is only available from 11am-1pm. The bottom of this pizza pie goes up on the edges to create a crusty holder for the toppings and cheese. The sauce is thick and on top. They taste delicious! Second is the pizza by the slice. This is generally available all day with many toppings. My husband's and many die hard customers' favorite has been and still is the Gut Buster. The third is the specialty pizzas they occasionally make. They make a lovely heart shaped pizza for Valentine's day. From time to time Garcia's has offered a wheat crust if your a healthy pizza eater. And much more. And finally the most unique thing about Garcia's pizza is the times that we have enjoyed in these once many restaurants and with our friends and family eating Garcia's. The smell and taste and even look of a slice of Garcia's send so many people down memory lane, myself included. I'm glad we can still enjoy a pass time that started right here in Champaign!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, for my parents' sake.  They always talk about how they loved Garcia's back in the 80's when they used to get slices at the upstairs location at Green and Wright, overlooking the Alma Mater.    Maybe that location was better maintained at the time.  But the remaining location, on Mattis, is rather disgusting.  The floor felt greasy and tacky beneath my feet.  I honestly don't think it had a thorough washing in the last year.  And there were lots of flies buzzing around, never a good sign.  But we stayed anyway, my parents wanted to see if it was the same pizza they remembered.   The pizza was actually tasty.  I can see why my parents liked it, and they said it tasted the way they remember it.  Also, the service was very slow, and the guy at the counter seemed like he'd rather be anywhere else than working there.  I can't see this place surviving, but I hope they can turn it around and bring it back to at least part of its former glory."}
{"text":"Was a great stuffed gut buster pizza, it takes longer to bake 40 minutes but if your not in a hurry it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Garcia's Pizza in a Pan, where did everything go wrong?  The story of Garcia's is similar to the story of drug kingpins in 1980s Miami. From humble beginnings, they climb their way to the top of the world, build an empire, but then everything comes crashing down.   As a boy, I remember the excitement of seeing the Garcias Brothers fly over our house in their hot air balloon (yes, the owners of Garcia's had an actual fucking hot air balloon, shaped like a tomato). There were around seven Garcia's Pizza joints in Champaign-Urbana, and everyone knew that Garcia's pizza was the best around.   Now, nearly twenty years later, the empire is long gone. There is one Garcia's restaurant still clinging to life, but just barely. The old hot air balloon van is parked out back collecting rust. I can only imagine that the Garcia brothers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, forgoing bill payments so that they can afford pot and blow (just a guess).   The pizza is still good (+ 3 stars), but put this restaurant on the critically endangered list. I don't see it surviving for much longer the way things appear to be going."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Illinois outside of Chicago! It's all about the crust which has an amazing flavor! I just get cheese pizza here the crust needs little to dress it up. I've in fact driven 140 miles just to get this pizza. I'll admit to a little nostalgia being involved, but who can put a price on that?! You just can't go wrong with the Flying Tomato Brothers!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible owner was completely disrespectful. Pizza tasted like leftovers from 2 days ago thee it away after 1 bite because I didn't want to get sick..."}
{"text":"This was a perfectly cooked pizza!! I called in and they told me 35 mins. I showed up 5 mins early and my order was ready to go. The young guy at the counter even opened the door for me on my way out. It was my GFs first time and now she knows why I like to come here first when I get into town. Thank you for the delicious pizza. Wish I could find a place like this in FL. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have loved Garcia's pizza for many years, eating it as student at IL State, class of 80. The location then was next to Watterson Towers. The place was classy, clean, good sized and had little slices of heaven, great pizza with a unique taste, which I had with cold apple cider.  The place was busy, one would wait in a line of 5-10 students. I always recommended the restaurant to out of town friends and they always thanked me for the suggestion. Once when I visited after graduation, I was shocked to see that the location had closed. How could a busy restaurant, serving such a great product, close?  Yesterday, I drove to the last remaining location to revisit my past.  WHAT THE HECK!  I visited the shabby location at noon and the dinning area was almost empty. The \"pizza\" was tasteless and the sausage on my slice of sausage pizza were so tiny I almost couldn't see them. I had driven many miles for nothing- for an illusion.   What the heck happened?   Did I care more about the pizza than the owners?  At least they can't take my memory from me.  I will remember the flying tomato brothers in my dreams, youthful, and kindly proving a great alternative to the horror that was dorm food in the 70's."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Garcia's.  It was definitely a staple of mine when I was in school.  They actually used to have a location right on-campus, and that's where I used to go.  That's been closed down since then.  Oh man... at night, they used to double their slice size... wow... good times.  I've been to this off-campus location a couple of times.  Same pizza... great value.  My high-school teacher used to come down for Illini football games and take all his former students to Garcia's after the game.  Again, good times.  You just can't beat memories like that."}
{"text":"I wanted to order a pizza to pick up for dinner so I didn't have to deal with cooking.  I called this location and this is the conversation:  Me: Hi!  I would like to place an order for pickup.  Me: Hello?  Surfer dude: Dude!!  I was supposed to be off at 2:00 and no one is here.  Me: What?  Surfer Dude: Seriously, no one is here and I'm leaving.  Me: Um....OK  Surfer Dude:  There is no one here to make a pizza.  I'm leaving!!  Me:  OK.  Bye.  Why did you answer the phone if you knew you were leaving??  I just couldn't give them one star for this because it was comical.  Not to mention it fits so well with what is expected from Garcia's Pizza.  If your a townie, you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Garcia has been a staple in champaign since I can remember eating pizza. I moved away for twelve years and  recently tried it and for the most part the pizza is the same. The two kids working were fighting in he back and that was awks bc it just was. I order d breadsticks and cheese and Marinara but got garlic sauce instead( the fight must have screwed up short term memory recall) the owner?  was there and asked if I had been helped which was nice but the cleanliness of the place was not ideal for wanting to eat and the kitchen from what I could see looked a little sketch. That being said I'm crushing pizza and breadsticks at home now and am mostly satisfied aside from the lack of marinara and queso. Will go back sometime next year probably but don't feel the need to add this to my regular repertoire of fast eating round these parts.  Farewell to the good old days when Garcia was in a sick tree house looking place with cubbies and games.  Lastly. After finishing the meal ( this is an edit ;) ) I am fairly certain the pizza is at least two days old"}
{"text":"I'm undecided about Garcia's.  It's kitschy, so that's cool, but it's not kitschy in an ironic way, and more in an odd way.  The wooden beams and the layout is nice, and the pizza is no frills--and they're serious about carding you, something I haven't had to deal with in awhile.  The pizza was adequate, not necessarily remarkable, but got the job done, and I was impressed that they had Blue Moon on tap (and NO crappy beers, great job, Garcia's).  That said, Garcia's gets a 3 star \"Meh.\"  You get the job done, but I'm not convinced I'm gonna be a fan yet.  I'll give you a little time when I finally move to C-U."}
{"text":"Gutbuster- best pizza in town by far"}
{"text":"I used to work at the campus location. I called the health dept, made a report, we closed the next day and never reopened. This is the nastiest possible place you can ever eat. Ralph is a drug addict and genuinely a terrible person. The mattis store is no better, trust me. It's a shame. I grew up in C-u. I remember the glory. It's gone guys. Just don't do it."}
{"text":"Well, like many of you, Garcia's PIzza holds a special place in my heart.  in the late 80's, Garcia's was in its heyday, and the Green Street location was the center of its universe.  Friday nights always ended with a slice or two and many, many games of Cyclone pinball in the dungeon.  Last week (08/11), I was back in Champaign with my 17 year old son and decided to visit Garcia's on Green St for old time's sake.  Well, the Green St location was kinda boarded up with signs directing us to a Mattis St location.  Long story short, Garcia's was not the same as I remember.  The pizza was good - not great - and I'm not really sure if it's changed over the years.  The ambiance was okay - kinda dirty and cluttered - not unlike the original but somehow lacking the character.  The original owner, a super nice guy, happened to be there that day and explained to be his reasons for closing down the Green St location (something about ginormous air conditioner bills).  I was somewhat sorry to see Garcia's reduced to this shell of its former self.  And, yes, the Tomato Van was rusting in the parking lot... :("}
{"text":"So-so pizza.  There's definitely better pies in town."}
{"text":"This pizza is by far the most god-awful pizza I've ever had in my entire life. I've had a ton of pizza and I even lived in Italy. But to call this sweet-tasting, Bisquick-crust nastiness pizza, should be an insult to anyone who's ever eaten pizza anywhere. Pizza Hut (2nd worst pizza) is better than this place, and that's saying something. They neeeed to change their sauce recipe. It's nasty."}
{"text":"Garcia's was 'pizza' at the University of Illinois for decades.  Ask any alum and they'll have memories of the 'squares' that were served there, and many more used to steal the nice plastic tray they came in as it worked well at home for microwaving.  They had a bit tomato hot air balloon they use to fly around campus on football weekends and some branch stores in Big 10 campus towns like Purdue.  Sadly, Garcia's fell on hard times in the 90s.  They lost their flagship store right across from the Quad and folks had to hike a bit down Green Street to get their fix.  They then started skimping on ingredients, switching to a pre-made crust and other cost-saving measures as the company went through hard times.  Alums still go back as it tastes a bit like it used to but new students generally are unimpressed and look toward other options.  The crust is kind of unique--sometimes I wonder if it is fried and they had a good number of toppings that you could get on them.    Pizza by the slice is really a 'walk up' kind of business model so when they lost their high traffic location they really suffered financially.  You used to eat there just to people watch.  Still worth visiting for old time sake, and I hope they get back on their feet and get going again."}
{"text":"As a U of I alum, I try to stop by and get a slice whenever I visit. While the guy behind the counter was nice, he apologized that it was his first day on the job (on a Friday night, no less!) and that he would have to make a new Gutbuster in about 10 minutes instead of getting our slices in 2 minutes in their ad. Gutbuster was just as I remembered it.  I can see why Garcia's has consolidated as this location was in between a Pizza Hut and Monical's Pizza on Mattis. I was disappointed to see that both 80's stalwarts (Garcia's & Papa Del's) have just about disappeared from the C-U area."}
{"text":"Pizza was prepared quickly and service was great.  Only con is the grape juice not being welch's grape juice.  Other than the beverage the food was just as I remember it.  I would definitely go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm a veteran of Garcia's Pizza in a Pan since the early 70's when my siblings would bring their leftovers back home after football and basketball games.  Quite good. When I lived in Indiana for ten years, it was always a treat to come back and have Garcia's. Very very few places in Indiana could come close to the quality of pizza as they did.  To this day, when my adult kids come to see me from Indiana they most always request a visit to Garcia's to enjoy their pizza and to take a slice home.  As usual, the pizza and breadsticks were great! No complaints here."}
{"text":"I went to Illinois in the late '80s, ate a lot of Garcias pizza back then, and I have to say it is as good or even better now.  Best crust and sauce I've ever eaten.  Sure, the service is a little slow, but as long as you set lowered expectations in this area, the wait is well worth it. Definitely the best pizza in Champaign-Urbana!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Gut-Buster from the Bloomington store today. When I called in the order the person working there didn't know what I was talking about. He explained that he had just started there and was working alone. We finally got the order straightened out and I made my way to Main St. to pick up the pizza. When I got there the wifi was inaccessible. Seems even the manager who was there yesterday doesn't know the password and didn't reset it. When the pizza came it was clearly overcooked. The flavor wasn't bad however the crust and topping were charred. With all this I don't necessarily put the full blame on the new employee there. There is no way a new hire should be working by themselves especially on a Friday afternoon while college is in session. This experience definitely not up to what I've experienced at this store or in Champaign."}
{"text":"24 years since I last tried and got a large stuffed pepperoni pan pizza.  With no recollection of how it tasted like 24 years ago as it was bar food on what always felt like the outskirts of Green Street, it reminded me a lot of Lou Malnatti's Pan Pizza from one of the good locations in the Chicagoland area (there are more bad than good Lou locations, but that is another review).  The location was a little dated, but product looked well prepared.  The crust was crispy and a good balance between cheese, topping, sauce, and crust.  Not one element dominated the pizza, which I find is not always the case with other pizzas.  The large stuffed was enough for two adults and a kid.  Not the best value (reason for one less star).  Was $23 for the large stuffed with pepperoni.  Large was not all that big and I'd consider it a medium stuffed at other locations.  Also go the bread sticks which both kids enjoyed so much,  they add the whole order so I was not able to try.  Worth trying out and looks to also be an enjoyable quiet place to dine in."}
{"text":"Garsha's pizza sauce has an unbelievably sweet flavor, and I heard that they include beet juice - can't swear by this statement, but it makes sense.  The crust is good, spiced with something unusual for Italian cooking, and it's a bit on the sweet side too.  The slices are rectangles and always thick.  Distinctive flavor that you either love or hate, so I rate 'em right down the middle."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go down the tubes. Yes, in the 70's we enjoyed Garcia's pizza almost weekly. Now, I might never go back.  Our pizza was promised for 3PM. We ordered salads and soda and sat down. We split salads, so I needed extra forks. Went to the counter to ask for them and was told that they needed to be washed. Really?! They were brought out to us shortly.  After noticing at 3:15 that the pizza hadn't arrived, I went to the counter to ask about it. Ralph (Flying Tomato Brother) said it had 3 more minutes to bake. When I reminded him it was to be ready at 3:00, he said he was working ALONE and had an unexpected rush (Really?!). Told him he should have let me know when we arrived. (Pizza was ordered about an hour earlier by phone.) Got a (free) pitcher of soda and sat back down. Pizza arrived approximately 10 minutes later.  Any way...after a few unhappy experiences, we enjoyed the heavy weight stuffed pizza. Don't know if I'll ever go here again. Shame to see this place in the state it is in. Needs Restaurant Impossible (Food Network)!"}
{"text":"Stopped in hoping to get a taste of the pizza I loved in college back in the early '80s.  Surprise!  It was better!  Lots of the same great sauce, and a truly perfect crust.  The original owner was there; it was like meeting pizza royalty.  If you get a chance, ask to get your pizza \"turboed\"."}
{"text":"Used to be excellent in the 90's...but the service has definetly changed!  A 45 minute wait for pizza slices is nuts.  Workers didn't know how to work the computer...credit card machine is in one place, computer in another, pizza maker was broken...HIGHLY disorganized.  The pizza is still delicious and the employees were busting their tails, but they need some serious organization to compete."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza ever.  I enjoy their deep dish better than any Chicago pizza including Giordano's and Lou Malnati's.  I am originally from the Champaign area so when I go home to visit the family this is what I crave.    The owners are nice but there workers are sometimes incompetent and sometimes they'll mess up your pizza.  One time I ordered for pick-up and when I came to pick it up 45 minutes later they told me they were out of sausage.  Kind of peeved that they couldn't have called me to tell me so I didn't have to wait another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Sooooo disappointed. Went there to revisit the mid 90's but soon realized that the place had not been cleaned since then. We were the only people in the joint but somehow every table was dirty. After cleaning a place to sit, we noticed that everything was nasty. In Lil Jon fashion, everything from the Windows to the walls were DIRTY. The food came out and after watching one of the workers making salads with his bare hands while touching everything else, I was almost certain that I was going to contract a disease. Pizza was burnt but did resemble the flavor of old. Couldn't wait to leave....really disgusted. You guys need to get it together. If you don't care about the business anymore, we get it. But close the doors before you get someone sick for real."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place for delivery bc of a coupon and it was seriously the best pizza we have had in our 2 yrs here in CU. We got the thin crust and it wasn't greasy , awesome taste and a great crust Was super pleased and anxious to try it again!"}
{"text":"Yum.  We just had our department board meeting and have a lot of alumni who come in from out of town.  For the past 2 years we've had Papa Del's and Garcia's delivered.  Believe it or not, more people liked Garcia's.  Don't get me wrong, we all eat the Papa Del's and love it, but Garcia's won the taste test or the bringing back the best memories test or something."}
{"text":"Life Changing Pizza  I know pizza. I love pizza. Thick crust, thin crust, new york style, chicago style, whatever. And Garcia's pizza is awesome. I've been eating it as a kid and since I've moved away from Champaign, it's always been a treat to visit this place when I come back. I always get the Slice Special. You get one (generous) slice of their pan pizza, 2 breadsticks with cheese dipping sauce, and a soda pop. It's the perfect amount of food and it's straight up delicious.   I can't attest to the other reviewers who have beef with the owner and management. They've always been nice to me. One time one of the employees walked out into the rain to get my order because the line at the drive thru was so long.   Overall, I highly recommend you give this place a shot. It's quick, delicious and cheap. Even the haters of this place agree the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Fro thoseo f us who grew up in this town, Garcia's used to be THE pizza place. But a lot of us agree they must have changes their recipe. It's just not that great anymore, which is really sad. They always have an empty parking lot and even more sparse dining area. The only things still \"ok\" is the baby deep dish. But I can NEVER remember which days they make them with which toppings. They also don't make very many, so when they are gone they're gone! I still go once in a blue moon just for memories -- but I never expect very good food."}
{"text":"I have to admit I liked Garcia's pizza.  Its not fancy or glamorous, but you can buy it by the slice and that makes a difference for lunch sometimes.  This place was never busy, so I did whatever I did that past for studing sometimes here.  The interior was nice and roomie and had and interesting set of furniture.  The crust was cruncy (not crisp on the bottom and doughy, really unique actually.  So unique in fact, occassionally I would get a specific craving, which is always a good sign.  The sauce was very tomato-y.  Good pizza, by the slice.  Cheap.  I can't argue.  I'd give it a 3.5 but must round down."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the staff was great. The food was average. I hear good things about deep dish pizza but I only had a regular pepperoni. It was good but not great. The breadsticks were just okay as well.   I do like that they sell pizza by the slice. Makes for a great lunch time eatery! I would come back but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars. Had a gift card so decided to give Garcias another chance. Called ahead for order at 6:50. They told me will be ready at 7:30. Showed up at 7:28. Guy at window tells me they are putting it in the oven now. WHAT?!?!? Then 10 minutes later the owner comes to the windows and asked me if I have ordered yet? I say yes ordered and paid. He then tells me to pull up. I say ok but voice concern about it being 50 minutes since I originally ordered it, he tells me (this is the owner mind you) IT IS FRIDAY NIGHT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT. I was furious. Needless to say last time I go there. Half the time the food upsets my stomach anyways. (Including that night)"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, should've just kept driving. The restaurant is so dirty that I am considering calling the health department. The  floor, the walls, tables, chairs haven't been cleaned in a long time. The pizza came out luke warm, which is a mystery if it just came out of a 500 degree oven. No napkins or silverware were brought out, even the plates seemed dingy.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"I first had Garcia \"Home of the flying tomato brothers \" pizza in the late 60's when I was stationed at Chanute AFB. In all my travels I have never had anything even close. I am retired from the AF but still make road trips from Indianapolis just to get my \"gutbuster\" fix. Thank you Garcia for not changing after all these years.  TSGT B R Carney USAF Retired"}
{"text":"I have absolutely loved Garcia's Pizza for 37 years ever since experiencing it in college on the campuses of Illinois State University & the University of Illinois. The atmosphere is hip and the service is fast, especially if you order that famous Garcia's rectangle slice. (One slice is sufficient, for me, because of the thick crust, and perfect amount of toppings. However, I do remember in college going back up to the counter for seconds, simply because the first had absolutely melted in my mouth.) Their pizza had such a unique taste that we, as college students, even on a budget, would just HAVE to go there at least once a week to have a slice of that hot, fresh-out-of-the-oven, soft, yeast-rich thick crust with oozing cheese!  The prices were always reasonable, and they still are.  The whole pan pizzas are stuffed with goodness, and I've actually had one sent to me all of the way to AZ, from my sister-in-law. Yes! It was THAT awesome!  While we were visiting Champaign, this Christmas, my son and husband brought home some slices of Garcia's pizza, and while they were there they ran into Ralph Garcia, himself. (See the photos that they took for me.)"}
{"text":"I do not like Garcia's pizza very much! From the outside the place looks cute and very inviting but once you go inside you will think differently! The pizza is nothing to talk about and I would suggest going somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Garcias is a Peoria memory...and after this experience a memory I would like to forget. So bad...so, so bad! The pizza crust was awful, sauce sweet but bland and toppings lacking. Dry and flavorless. The salad was basic but dressing awful. Just take your money and throw it out the window. How this place stays in business blows my mind!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza - plenty of toppings, but nearly no sauce. Thin crust was a perfect balance of crunch and soft dough. Breadsticks were dry and bland. We got a bacon and spinach large pizza, and it took 4 of us to finish it. Overall, more substance than you get elsewhere, but it wasn't great by any means.  Update: 2/29/08 I've gone back here a few times since my original review, and every time that I do, their prices have risen... Not once, but 3 times in a row. They were already expensive compared to other chain pizza, but now outrageously so. It was $18.45 for a large, thin crust, 2-topping pizza (with nearly no toppings, actually). The carry-out menus have clearly not been updated in a year or so since I was quoted over the phone different prices than the ones in my hand. Frustrating since you can get the same pizza for 1/2 as much elsewhere, AND everywhere else has a larger selection of side items (here: cookies or breadsticks) and toppings (here: 6-7 basics)."}
{"text":"I absolutely use to love Garcia's and came here multiple times a week for lunch.  Now, we have a love hate relationship.  I've had the best Pizza here, I've had the worst pizza ever here.   I've had the best service here, I've had the worst service here.  You never know what you will get.  It could be great...It could be terrible.  It's been mainly terrible lately though.  I've slowly started coming here less and less and I fear that I may never come here again.  I have a feeling a lot of people are doing the same.  This use to be a happening place....not so much anymore.  Good Luck!   I hope it's good...."}
