{"text":"Bought an iced coffee with the expectation of being able to drink it and silly me... It wasn't drinkable. One sip and I swerved over to the closest dumpster to dispose of it. Not only the worst coffee I've ever had, but the literally the worst drink I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best Latte in the region. Good friendly service. Our favorite over all the major chains. It is a small drive thru stand. They also have tastey treats to go with your coffee."}
{"text":"My go to spot when I'm visiting home. This place has great lattes and is just too cute with the details (chocolate covered espresso bean on top and a holiday sticker tab to prevent spilling in the car). Drive through and pick something up! I don't do syrup but they seem have every flavor you can think of. Cash only tho."}
{"text":"One \"coffee\" was enough.  Anyone who tasted what I tasted could never legitimately review this drive-thru kiosk's coffee as anything better than ok.  Personally, I found it to be the worst thing in liquid I ever had the misfortune to injest.  Cute marketing which draws the  attention of passersby, but it's a total bait and switch.  BTW, how old are the coffee beans?  Have they been frozen?  When were they ground?  It's sadly not really something I want to contemplate..."}
