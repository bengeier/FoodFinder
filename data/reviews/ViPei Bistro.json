{"text":"We went there for a Saturday brunch. Overall, we were very happy.  The VeVechi (mushroom and spinach egg benedict) was fantastic.  The only surprise was that their omelet is a bit strange. The vegetables are on the top rather than inside the egg. However, it tasted great.  We will need to go back another time for a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Once you taste their arancini you'll be hooked!  I was introduced to Frano's one evening while out at a friends house visiting.  We decided on Italian and when she suggested Frano's I just went with it.  The Pizza, delicious, the calamari, incredible but again, being Sicilian, the arancini brought me straight back to my roots - INCREDIBLE!  I will definitely be back when I am in the area!  Great job team!"}
{"text":"This may be the best meal I have ever had!  We went in about 4:30 for an early dinner and there were only a few other patrons.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and just a delightful person.  We ordered the bruschetta to begin with.  It was mouthwatering.  Very fresh tomatoes, delicious goat cheese and thin bread.  It also included 2 delicious spicy shrimp and salad that was very tasty - not just a decoration.   I ordered the Angry salmon, which has a Cajun flair.  The salmon absolutely melts in your mouth and the spiciness was just right, along with great pasta and sauce.  My husband ordered the special seafood pasta and loved everything about it - seafood, sauce, etc.  They also brought delicious bread with olive oil and balsamic reduction.   Delicious!  We are only here 3 more days, and may be back 3 times - they serve brunch until 4:00!"}
{"text":"Great selection, this is a Stoufville gem. You need to order the Indian King pasta, fantastic flavor and perfectly spiced. Portion sizes are big so bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"Short review: Good menu with reasonable prices. Restaurant-quality food in a bistro setting.  Long review: I'm very happy Vi Pei Bistro opened in Stouffville. This restaurant fills the gap for a family-friendly restaurant with a menu that will please many palates and prices that won't break your wallet.   Came here for brunch, lunch and dinner; each time was a good experience. Service is fast and friendly.   Their kids' menu is great. Healthy options such as pasta and salmon along with the usual breaded chicken strips. The portions are big too.   Desserts are made in-house. Tried the rolled crepe, it was delicious! The caramel sauce was sweet (as a caramel sauce should be) and fragrant."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast during a weekday.  Price was really good for the early bird specials (4.99) but you get what you pay for. Simple and nothing special but good food and service. I would give them 3/5 for that.  I also returned for dinner and expected more since it was dinner and they had lots of pasta options. I tried the fried calamari and the pan seared scallops pasta. The calamari was not crispy at all!! So that was very disappointing. And the scallops were not seared at all! The pasta was okay at best.  The service was okay, however there is only one waitress serving the whole restaurant and because of that I think service lacked. My partner was waiting for water to be filled up for at least half the time we were there for dinner and we ended up walking out of the restaurant with her not filling it up. I would not return because of this. Over priced and not good food or customer service."}
{"text":"Great menu.  Variety and quality. Yummy warm mushroom salad to start. Very tasty pasta.  Excellent service. Thoroughly enjoyed my recent visit. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast there (about 4 times) but holy moly what an incredible deal for weekday breakfasts until 11am. 3.99 and they are classy, interesting, tasty, best home fries, good selection on the breakfast menu with a bit of nice salad and fruit.  Plus Donna, the server most often there in the morning when we went is just wonderful, funny, smart, accommodating and efficient.  Highly highly recommend. Oh, and good coffee too."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my family, the decor is a bit run down and could be freshened up, but the food was delicious and unique! There was so much to choose from, lots of egg Benedict options, omelettes, cheese stuffed French toast, pancakes etc. Pricing is very reasonable and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Came here on Monday night and it was dead quiet.  I was hesitent to go in and eat.  They had $28 dinner specials with lobster unfortunately i am allergic so i didnt get a chance to try.  I proceeded with the regular menu and order grillex spring veggie appetizer, calamari, a generous plate of seafood pasta and keylime pie.  Cooked foods was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.  Keylime pie was a bit sweet for my liking and the bread was average.  Prices seem very reasonable  for the portions you get.  Definitely  going back soon."}
{"text":"Very nice place for breakfast.  Breakfast special was really good and the eggs Benedict looked really nice.  Food presentation was very impressive some one cares about the food  and the potatoes were perfect.  Will certainly be back.  Will have to try the lunch at some point and the wine selection looked really good so maybe dinner is in order.  Thanks for a great breakfast"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. The house special has this mascarpone filled French toast that is heavenly."}
{"text":"I have now been to ViPei a couple of times and am happy to say that it has pretty darn good italian food and fabulous service. So far, the pasta dishes are winning hands down. I tried the Veal Marsala and while quite good, it was not quite the marsala experience I was hoping for. On the other hand, I tried the pan fried scallops with the vodka cream sauce and it was spectacular. I would order this every time if I was not so darn curious. The menu is extensive so you could visit a dozen times and still have a dozen more things to try. The service has been nothing short of exceptional with consistently friendly, professional and informative staff. The decor is exactly to my taste which is to say you could arrive in jeans or a tie and be equally at home."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've gone to a brunch place in Stouffville and we've lived here for 4 years.   The place is small and cozy. The waitress there was really friendly and helpful in food recommendations. Seems like she knows quite a lot of the locals that come in. We had the weekend brunch special and boy was it totally worth it.  The portions were very generous and definitely worth more than the $12 that we paid. Totally worth the time and money to give this place a try in Stouffville."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall is one of the best restaurants in Stouffville!  The food is very tasty, the portions are huge, the service is friendly and fast, and the menu has a great variety of pastas and Italian-style meat dishes. They also have a kids menu that caters to even my picky eaters.  I had the scallop spaghettini, which was exceptionally good, and my wife had the beef tenderloin medallions which were cooked perfectly and were served with a staggering array of fresh veggies.  All that and they have a decent and affordable wine selection.  Breakfast/brunch and lunch are equally good!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Similar quality to downtown brunch places at better prices. Eggs bene and Grand Marnier french toast are winners"}
{"text":"Very good food. Enjoyed brunch with my girlfriend on a Sunday. We had the French toast and eggs Benedict. Both delicious. It was busy but we got a table within 10 min. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were hoping for great things and were sorely disappointed. The food was weird and greasy. The cooking staff was argumentative with other guests.  Pass this one by."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my stay in this place, food are fresh, service was great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I come here for a lunch and ordered the brunch special: Egg benne and the Tenderloin steak sandwich.  Maybe it's brunch, the presentation doesn't look as nice as the one shown from the pictures that other reviews have posted. It's still acceptable but I guess dinner will be better.  Anyhow, the more important factor is taste.. The Egg Benne is ok, with runny yolk inside, sauce is on par, so nothing different from the ones I have had before in other restaurants. So it's ok.  For $13, acceptable for this dish.  As for the tenderloin sandwich, for $16, I think it's worth the money with the portion of food you get : 6oz tenderloin, bread, saut√©ed onion, mushroom, bacon, cheese, fries, and salad. Cannot complain...   Looks like in the area, this is the only restaurant that offer these kind of food, so it's a nice addition to the area. I have mention this on my other review before, this restaurant is very close to Red Bulb, so u can go grab a latte or a nice cup of coffee after finish the brunch here! :)  The decor is ok and clean and my waitress is very friendly! A big plus! I initially give this a 3.5 stars but I give it an extra 0.5 star because of the friendliness of service."}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times we've been here for brunch. It always seems packed on weekends, but the wait is reasonable.   Their daily specials are fantastic. Among my recurring favourites are: seafood omelette, smoked salmon benny, steak benny, brie-stuffed french toast (usually comes with chocolate chips, bananas, etc.). Service is always great.  We've also been here for dinner a few times. All of their pastas have proven to be delicious, and they have really good Pinot Noir! The ambiance is very low-key and intimate in evenings (i.e. candles at each table)."}
{"text":"Great Food Friendly Staff and Fair Pricing !!"}
{"text":"Pretty safe to say this is the best sit down Italian food in Stouffville. There are a few other options, that may have fancier settings, but this place seems to have the best flavor.   Came here with 7 family members so I was able to taste several dishes. Everyone was very pleased with the flavor, portions, and service.   The interior of the restaurant seemingly hasn't changed from when this restaurant used to be an Italian restaurant called \"Franos\", which was also quite good. ViPei has stepped up the menu since the days of Franos. Although I think the new name is weak.  First I want to say that all the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente. I would highly recommend the Tri-Color Tortellini. Great spinach cream sauce with mushrooms and smoked bacon. Also the Chicken Gorgonzola penne was top notch. Their cheesy cream sauce was very rich and it has great toppings including mushroom varieties and my personal favorite, sundried tomatoes.   Avoid the calamari appetizer, seems obviously of the frozen variety. Not great. But they offer free bread with oil and balsamic, so no worries on the appetizers.  All in all, this place is great for VERY solid Italian food. Great selection on the menu and they feature a lot of seafood. Literally a hidden gem in Stouffville. This place sits between a Subway and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Breakfast or lunch?  When that's the hardest decision you have to make all day, it's a pretty good day.  At ViVetha, either choice will be a good one with a bistro menu including flavorful breakfast staples (eggs, pancakes, French toast), salads, sandwiches, and seemingly endless varieties of pasta.   On this particular occasion, I went with the one of the breakfast specials - an impressive looking plate of eggs Benedict, one half English muffin topped with crab cake and the other with steak and mushrooms, accompanied by a balsamic field green salad, potatoes and a mini tower of fruit garnish.  The eggs were cooked nicely, with the perfect amount of \"yolky runniness\" to saturate the muffin.  The crab cake was on the smaller side, and pretty basic in flavor and quality.  With the Hollandaise, it was fine.  The steak was cut into small strips and paired with an array of fresh wild mushrooms, which to me was the highlight of the dish.  The salad was a welcome addition both aesthetically and \"acidically\" with the bright vinegar pop of balsamic.  Slightly overdressed, but hardly a fault.  The potatoes, while underseasoned, were cooked to that delicate balance of crispy exterior and tender interior, and flavored by sauteed onions and peppers.  It's almost like a three course meal on a plate, with the fruit slices adding a sweet finish.    I sampled a bite of two other dishes - the Seafood Delight and the Smoked Sausage Pasta.  The seafood was in fact delightful, fresh and well cooked with a generous variety of shrimp, scallops and mussels (the salmon was left out on order).  The mussels tasted a tiny bit off, but not enough to ruin the dish.    The Smoked Sausage Pasta had a spicy kick from the tomato sauce and bright flavors from the fresh herbs and feta cheese.    Service was very friendly, and the enthusiasm was appreciated.  It's a small space, so the kitchen and lone server can get a little backed up - our meal took a bit longer than expected to arrive, but that only meant a minor inconvenience to run out and add more money to the parking meter.  Overall, ViVetha is a casual place to get a fresh, flavorful meal and friendly service."}
{"text":"I actually went here after a Yelp Elite event nearby. I used Yelp to find it and am glad I did as it's in a very non-decript unit in a strip mall that I would not have bothered with for sure.  The place is nice and pretty formal and romantic. I liked that despite being young and not entirely dressed for the restaurant due to coming from something active, the waitress was super friendly and didn't seem snobby at all.  I forgot what it was called but I had a pasta dish heavily inspired by Indian flavours. It was a risky choice but when I saw it on the menu it was so inventive that I had to try it and I am glad I did; it was delicious! These are the types of menu items I love to see as it distinguishes your restaurant and gives you a signature dish that no one else does."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and the atmosphere was very cozy. Located in a small plaza in Stouville that is easy to miss. Ordered the maras prone stuffed French toast and the caramel sauce was very light- with a hint of banana which wasn't too overpowering. Also got the crab cakes which are made in house- yummy and the fact that the portions are so big for the price you get- makes it very worth it to check out."}
{"text":"Loved this little bistro! We were looking for a good place to eat brunch in Stouffville and accidentally came here and we are so happy we did. It is Saturday and they have a special brunch menu which is to die for. French toast special was great, the eggs special delicious and so was the salmon omelette with goat cheese. The plates are big, lots of fruit, bacon was thick and crispy and the sausages were great too. I give these guys 2 big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Everything is absolutely delicious. I especially enjoy the pasta dishes but the salads are also really refreshing and light."}
{"text":"One if the best french toasts I have had! Really great food, cute little spot, good service. Great prices! I can't get over that french toast, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Small but cozy bistro. Very friendly service and the food isn't half bad either. I wouldn't plan a big party table there due to space issues. And parking is so limited since it's shared with the other shops beside it. A couple dining there would be sufficient. Make sure to call before going because I think the times are incorrect on Yelp. I think they're closed on Mondays and are only open from 7 AM until 3 PM"}
{"text":"The place is a nice little local place. But i ordered stuffed french toast and it was tooooo sweet and stuffing was invisible. So little you could not feel anything and it was too much sweet syrup. I mean they could put it on the side but instead it was purred all over plate and everything (including sausage, bacon & fruits) were sweeeet. My hobby got eggs Benedict which was OK but not top the notch."}
{"text":"This is a very small joint and not a fancy place. But their food and service is excellent. The portion are big and for a very affordable price. They only open till 3pm. So no dinner service.   I came here on my day off with my husband. I ordered the seafood omelette. And my hubby ordered the grilled fish.  Their menu changes every time. So I can't remember the name of each dish.  Hubby also ordered a Golden Beet Soup. It was really good. And there was a touch of goat cheese with went well with the soup.   My seafood omelette was delish. There was even a whole slab of salmon in the centre. The roasted potatoes were divine. Nice semi crisp shell wrapped with a delicate pocket of potato fluff, with you chew it in your mouth. There was also a white melon that was so sweet and crunchy on the side.   My hubby also enjoyed his meal a lot. The golden beet salad with his grilled fish was delish as well.   Definitely would come back for breakkie or brunch. Hope they have dinner service again later on."}
{"text":"Great for lunch with the girls. The food is made fresh and you can customize to suit your requirements."}
{"text":"Went there because it was friends' neighborhood brunch spot. Portions were big but the food was unfortunately nothing special. I had the eggs benedict but it was just about above average- if you are starving and in the mood for a somewht decent benny, go here for brunch"}
{"text":"This is fantastic hidden gem in Stouffeville. Intimate setting with only 10 tables and incredibly attentive and friendly service.  Donna happened to be working this evening (she usually only does lunch) and she is the best.    We tried the angry chicken pasta, Gorgonzola chicken pasta, crab cake app, grilled veggies (amazing!). All fresh and perfectly prepared. A lot of care goes in to these dishes. Look forward to frequenting this place on our visits to family in this area."}
{"text":"I just have to reinforce how happy we are to have Vi Pei in Stouffville! Every time we go back we are delighted with the staff, the service, the menu and the delightful presentation! Thank you Vi Pei! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem, their 8am-10am breakfast deal is great. A great selection reasonably priced.  My friend and I we both ordered the pancake and eggs (plus additional $2 each of us for adding sausage), a coffee and a tea, after tax was only $18! Amazing price for two of us! Good portions too?'hi"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Stouffville where you can enjoy a big portion of delicious brunch. The mussels in gorgonzola cream sauce is a must to order every time I visit, super creamy!! Also, the special brunch menu has great varieties, other than the normal choice of porched eggs, bacons, sausages..., etc, it provides pasta as well. Love the food combination for each dish on the brunch menu!   Other than the food quality,  the customer service is another thumbs up for them! Excellent service, servers are very kind and always come and refill free coffee. They deserve for great tips.  Wishing they can open during dinner hours too! Because the food quality is way beyond the average compared to those big chain restaurants!!!"}
{"text":"Must try their French toast with caramelized peaches!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. But food was bland and mediocre and high priced. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I was torn writing this review because I truly enjoyed the French toast! We ordered 2 kids meals: salmon spaghetti and shrimp pasta that came in decent size and price for $7 each, a breakfast platter and a grand-marnier infused french toast.  Not that i was counting, though the server seemed genuinely nice, we were disappointed 4 times. First she forgot to bring us the menus, then apologised that it \"got busy\" and did not come take our order until we aggressively waved them down. I didnt agree with her concept of w busy because the place was at half capacity at 1 pm. Afterwards, she forgot the sausages that were supposed to be part of the adult entrees, and brought me a flat coffee with lots of cinnamon for what was supposed to be a cappuccino; she said she tried her best but it didnt foam up!   Like i said rhe French toast was oretty good but i will definitely NOT go back again."}
{"text":"Vi Pei is obviously a homemade mom & pop Italian style restaurant. The food is fantastic and prepared perfectly. Even the Caesar salad dressing is authentic homemade Italian. You can taste the subtlety of the anchovies. The prices are fair. And service was excellent and prompt."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since the reviews were pretty good, and I was not disappointed!  As other reviewers said, it's very reasonably priced and the service was excellent.  I had the warm mushroom salad with scallops and it was delicious.  The portion sizes are good too - I was stuffed after.  I think we will try the breakfast next :)"}
{"text":"Good: Specials - There's some interesting brunch specials here with fairly large portions.  French toast stuffed with mascarpone and crab cake eggs benedict were both filling and tasty.  Neutral: Wild Blueberry Pancakes - This was only ok.  I like the caramelized apples as it added that necessary sweetness.  The syrup I poured over the pancakes surprisingly was not very sweet at all.  Bad: Service - Came during brunch hours on a Sunday and the restaurant was full.  We waited a few minutes to be seated and ordered shortly after.  Unfortunately, we ended up waiting close to 40 minutes for our food (table of 3).  I've never worked in a kitchen but I don't think it should take 40 minutes to make brunch food.  Worth it? I'd probably give it another shot as the prices are decent.  I'll try for dinner though and not brunch.  There are definitely better places for brunch out there."}
{"text":"I was at ViPei yesterday with some friends. I ordered from the specials menu. I had eggs benedict served on a potato pancake with crab cake and smoked salmon. It had some home fries and a salad on the side. I left very stuffed and satisfied. When I cut into my poached eggs they spilled out over the potato pancake. OMG it was delish. Everything was fresh. The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the uptown core.   My friend and I stumbled upon this place because we'd been refused seats at T- Buds Tea Lounge down the street, and were looking desperately for some brunch.   The place was empty when we walked in (I'm guessing due to brunch hours being over?) and we were the only customers.   We got our menus and I finally decided on the Santa Fe omelette ($8) +$1 for egg whites. This omelette had julienned peppers in a spicy tomato mushroom sauce. My friend settled for the shrimp linguine ($12). I also ordered a coffee ($1.75).  The food arrived quickly and my omelette was accompanied with a green salad with some mango type of dressing, and \"home fries\" which were chunks of potatoes. The omelette was superb! It was really spicy with the sauce but that's how I like it! Salad was a great add, too. Didn't try the fries as they looked kind of oily but my friend tried them and said they were great!   I also tried a shrimp from my friend's linguine and it was perfect!   Coffee was quite good, too.   My total came to about $12.50, which was pretty good considering the amount I had just eaten and how full I was. Plus, brunch in this area does normally get pricey.   Decor was nice as well. Frank Sinatra playing in the background was a great touch.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is due to the service. Our waitress was nice, but she gave us one bill, and we wanted separate bills. When I asked for a separate bill (very politely), she threw me a very rude look.   Also, I think she was setting up the bistro for dinner when we were eating, and kept shooting us looks of \"can you leave soon?!\" every now and then. Not fun.  Other than that, I really oddly liked this place. I want to come back for this omelette alone, but want to also try more of their egg dishes.   So close to a 5!"}
{"text":"The yolk of poached eggs dripped all over a delicious crab cake.  A rainbow trout filet was skillfully cooked, and it went surprisingly well with smoked bacon and poached eggs.  By the way, I was describing a breakfast not a dinner.  Are you drooling yet?  In additional to dinners, this hard working bistro opens for breakfasts and brunches, 7 days a week.  The breakfast menu is very extensive.  There is also a special breakfast menu that features regular items with a twist, and it was how we got a rainbow trout filet for brunch.  We loved the interesting food, and the services.  Linda is a breeze to deal with.    Pricing is modest for a French/Italian restaurant.  The ambiance is intimate and casual, kind of straddle between romantic and family friendly.  I will say the food is a notch above casual.  The portion is reasonable.  ViPei offers good food and good value for the whole package and for this price point.    As far as brunches go, it is outstanding.  We will return to experience the dinner offerings."}
{"text":"This used to be Franos.  We came for breakfast/brunch this weekend and had a very good experience. I love the mascarpone cheese stuffed French toasts. They have a lovely weekend brunch menu. We had both pancake and French toasts; the French toasts were definitely better. Portions were large; very good refillable coffee, and friendly & attentive service.  I'll be back to try lunch and dinner menus next time."}
{"text":"This place was a word of mouth discovery, and did not disappoint.  Fresh ingredients and great Italian food flair.  Twists on everything, including great pizzas, pasta dishes, all comprised of Italian family expertise.  Great host and servers too.  Don't miss their Italian themed desserts or coffees either.  Looking forward to going back."}
