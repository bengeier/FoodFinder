giant sandwiches.
fresh ingredients. 
best staff."}
{"text":"Small and unassuming, very \"mom n pop\" feel. The owners are the friendliest people ever, and they're crazy good at remembering customer's names and their regular orders. All their sandwiches are ridiculously good, I love the egg salad, and the chicken club is perfect too! Reasonably priced too, pretty much what I'd expect to pay if I made it myself. So rare for liberty village; they're really hitting a much needed niche in this terribly overpriced neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write this review because I've had numerous Bacon + Egg bagels for breakfast from numerous shops (and i just sampled one from another liberty street spot this morning to give it a try) but my Friday morning bacon+egger from Naomi is a standout.  

Nary does a toe cross over the threshold before being greeted with a genuine 'good morning' - just a great way to start the day. 

Put in your order, sit, read the paper, watch the husband and wife team work their magic and after a few, you'll be rewarded with your quarry.  

Granted, it's 2 eggs and 4 to 6 strips of bacon in alternating layers on a bagel, so it's not an entirely grease free affair, but it's far from being an issue or a deal-breaker."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, very friendly staff. Awesome chicken club sandwich for a really fair price especially for the area that thinks everyone in Liberty Village is rich."}
{"text":"'Quaint' little place. The bibimbap is nothing to write home about, but is fast and cheap"}
{"text":"Food is ok. What makes it appealing is the cheap price to be honest, especially when you're in a neighborhood that doesn't have much for lunch options unless you want to pay a lot more. The Chicken or Turkey Club sandwich is ok. Pretty run of the mill stuff and nothing makes it stand out other than the price in comparison most other places in the area. The Bi Bim Bap and the Stir Fried noodles are also ok. Hard to complain when its so cheap. I mean what do you expect to get when most things are under 7$.

All in all, the prices are cheap and the food is decent. I mean you can't be expecting gourmet deliciousness at those prices.

Seriously, Liberty Village sucks. What an overrated piece of yuppie douchey trash area."}
{"text":"Great breakfast option in the area. It might seem strange to get a sandwich from a Japanese/Korean restaurant but they make some really solid ones. Very friendly owners, as well.

I recommend the western omelette sandwich! I've been hooked on it ever since."}
{"text":"Cheap & cheerful! I recommend the chicken club sandwich, and their little carrot and banana cakes are quite tasty too."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so cheap, great home cooking, sort of a blend between between a diner and Korean/Chinese comfort foods. My favorite things there are the Beef Stir-Fry with Noodles or Rice, Club Sandwich with Chicken or Turkey, and their western sandwich is very satisfying. The best thing about this place is the couple that own this cute place. They are beyond cute, and they treat everyone with the same amount of kindness. I also love the brown rice green tree that you can't get anywhere else (except for Korean restaurants) Nothing fancy but that how their prices stay reasonable. I hope the bigger chains don't take their business away on Atlantic as they are starting to move in."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get lunch in Liberty Village.  Great prices, excellent sandwiches.  You're always greeted here with a smile.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this class of restaurant - simple but not basic, delicious but not pretentious, popular but not packed.

The club sandwich here is seriously fantastic, and the prices are great as well"}
{"text":"This small family business has THE best BLT sandwiches. Absolutely yummy. They have other very delicious meals on the menu (ex. Bi Bim Bop), but seriously their BLTs are great. If you are in the area, I recommend you try one. 

Writing this has just reminded me of how much I like them; and now I must go get one..."}
{"text":"Naomi is one of the last remaining reasonably-priced options in the neighbourhood.  They have decent, normal food at a decent price.  Their selection includes basic sandwiches, breakfast (including a bacon/egg/cheese on a bagel), snack items such as butter tarts, and a small selection of flavoured coffees.  The breakfast bagel does tend to be greasy, but you can ask them to leave off the butter, and it does taste good.  One thing I do watch for is the cream for the coffee, since it does seem to sit out and get a little warm (sometimes I skip it and get cream from the office instead just to be on the safe side.)  The owners here are a friendly couple.  I would recommend Naomi if you are looking for a little snack or something cheap."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Family run, very friendly, and cheap. Just ate here with my partner for under 15 bucks all in."}
{"text":"This place has the best muffins in town! I am addicted to muffins from Timmoy's n Second cup(believe from same supplier), and I love pastries. I just happened to walk to Naomi a while ago to grab a treat on the way to work in the mor, they happened to have the muffins tasted like nothing else. And I have been going there since. 

The muffins are HUGE, and only $1.25 each no tax. I have tried every kind they had on display. They have chocolate chips, apple cinnamon, blueberry, poppy seeds lemon, and sometimes orange(yes tastes like orange--has flavor of orange pop, but i believe they used orange juice). Their muffins are soft and wrapped up sealed nicely, so u wont be expecting those hard shelled muffins from Tim Horton's. I think those muffins they make taste more like freshly made cake. I tried to ask for recipe they said its secret(hah no brainer). 

I have seen their menu, they have pretty good stuff. I'd love to try some time. The best thing about this place is the family run restaurant, the wife n husband are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo NICE. U know they just truely nice ppl. The moment u walk in, they greet you, and they can't thank you enough for buying small things like muffins n bits. And they make sure both tell  you good bye n have nice day etc. U feel warmth. 

Last Saturday my friend was driving by, I tried to go to buy couple of muffins, but the place was closed. They only open till 2pm on Saturdays, and I suspect they even open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Naomi is run by the most adorable couple who really love the restaurant. I only stepped into the restaurant to glance over the menu and within seconds I was making a purchase because the old happy man was too chummy to refuse. And it pains me to write this review about the bad quality of their entrees.

I've been to Naomi twice. The first time I bought the Salmon bibimbap and the second time I bought the Chicken teriyaki. The pictures looked really really good so I opted for them, but both dishes were disgusting.

I was really thrown off by how quickly they were able to prepare both dishes. Under 5 minutes?!?! It seemed almost too good to be true. When I opened the container and took the first bite of the meat, I fully understood why.

Naomi uses canned meats. For some people, this is okay, but I really could not stand how \"plastic\" the chicken felt. The meats weren't even seasoned, rather covered in mediocre sauces. The teriyaki sauce wasn't even teriyaki sauce... it was a transluscent orange with a syrupy consistency.

The bibimbap was also poorly done. There was no sunny side up egg, and the only veggies consisted of bland bean sprouts, overcooked carrots, and boiled spinach. Although, the \"gochujang\" sauce was not bad.

However, my friends have all claimed that Naomi's sandwiches are extremely tasty, but after my two bad experiences, I'm probably not going to come back.

TLDR: don't get any entrees. Stick with the cafe classics."}
