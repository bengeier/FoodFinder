{"text":"Based on the other reviews, I was expecting this place to be up there in my top 5  vegetarian chinese food restaurants of all time. Based on my experience, it will go on my list of underwhelming vegetarian chinese food restaurants.   My pick-up order took about twice as long as they told me that it would, which was kind of a bummer, but not a huge deal.  THEN, I got whatever fake chicken dish I ordered home, and it was just firm tofu. Fake chicken doesn't taste like real chicken at the best of times; firm tofu does not taste like any fake meats at all. It is not even remotely the same texture or anything. This was a major bummer.   Also, I got the spring roll platter, and the salad rolls were all rice noodle, and then about one tiny slice of mango.   ANYWAYS - this place was fine, but it would definitely not be my first choice.  the end."}
{"text":"Classic and consistent.  Slow service, but worth the wait. I just wish they had more noodle dish options."}
{"text":"Barely edible food and shitty customer service. Had to call for over 10 mins just get a menu and ask 3 times for water because the waitress kept forgetting."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm definitely a carnivore, so the fact that there is no meat on the menu is usually a major bummer. But you can't argue with good tasting food, regardless of how much delicious meat there is or isn't on your plate. Besides, they have fake meat! The mock chicken in lemon sauce is super delicious. Definitely free-range tofu. The mock chicken with mango in toro nest is great too.   Also, my wife says they have the cleanest washroom in Chinatown,which is kind of like winning a Juno, but still worth mentioning."}
{"text":"The food was great (but not as good as Buddha's Vegetarian a couple blocks over), but the service was the worst I've ever had. We are usually pretty quick in-and-out diners, but it took us 2 hours to get out of this place. It took them almost 20 minutes to take our order and after they did our food didn't come for 45 minutes. I sought out the server who was overtly rude and flippant. They served three tables their food before us that came in after us as well which was super frustrating. The biggest issue was the one server, an older lady. She had it out for us for some reason. There was a younger girl that was sweet and could see that we were getting frustrated, but she couldn't do much because she has other tables. This is the first time I never tipped at a restaurant. Again, the worst service and overtly rude. She said \"just in time\" when she brought the food out to us 45 minutes after we ordered. NOT COOL."}
{"text":"High quality of food, great value for money, friendly staff, and convenient location.  It is by far my favoritate Chinese vegetarian restaurant in Toronto Chinatown.   Love it!"}
{"text":"oddly enough I had made plans to try Buddha down the street from here, they happened to be closed (Tuesday's) so we tried Greens instead and I must say, I'm THRILLED we did!! staff was fantastic, food was pipping hot, fresh and just delicious!! I can honestly say I was shocked and amazed! going back 100%!!  the sweet and sour \"chicken\" AND lemon \"chicken\" were just phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup on the phone. Waited for an hour and  they haven't even started to cook? Wtf?"}
{"text":"My family and I are piscaterians, we could go to any Asian spot to satisfy our hunger anywhere in Chinatown but we come here for the mock meats! I remember reading about this joint on Yelp and wanted to try their dishes. I love the Young Chow Fried rice and Beef Lo Mein. I just hate that it's so silent! My family and I sound like we're yelling when we're talking with our inside voices!   Prices are decent but portions could be a bit larger. I forgot to mention how great the Lemon Chicken is, we get it every time we're here!!"}
{"text":"So far, Greens is easily the best vegetarian Chinese food we've found in the GTA - big, yummy portions, fair prices, good hours and a good location.  The menu is huge, and everything we've tried on it has been amazing.  The green beans and the orange chick'n were especially yummy, and I look forward to trying the soups, which everyone recommends so highly.  As a few other Yelpers have noted, the service can be a bit uneven, but that didn't bother us.  Overall, I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"The people were super nice. Service was great and food came out not too quick and not too slow (when food comes out TOO quick, you get suspicious lol)  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was quite happy with the food! And for the prices they charge, the quality is very good. Portions are HUGE. You have been warned about their portions lol.  We got:  Braised tofu with brown sauce (deep fried tofu. Crispy outside, soft inside). I would have been happier with less of this. It tastes great for the first 2 oval shaped balls, but after that you're like, omg, no (because we had two other dishes to eat from as well). This should be more like an appetizer, but they give you so much, that you would be full with just this.   Fried Rice Noodles with Mock Beef. Beef tasted surprisingly similar to real beef! It had that nice wok-smoked flavour. Noodles were chewy, and there were tons of crunchy veggies. Crispy Egg Noodles with Mixed Vegetables. Juicy, juicy veggies.  In conclusion, service, quality and portions exceed prices, by a lot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Greens. I usually get take out as I live really close by. I always just come in and place my order and wait (never takes more than 10 minutes to come out) and their very friendly staff give me a free pot of green tea while I'm waiting. I took two friends visiting from out of town for a dine in experience (one a vegetarian, the other not) and we has an amazing meal - we got the lemon \"chicken\", noodles with mock beef, and a spring roll platter - we had enough food to fully feed the three of us, plus enough leftovers for 2 lunches for me! The food was enjoyed by all, vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  Great prices, great food, lovely staff - eat here!!"}
{"text":"the food is amazing! portions are huge... there's really no other place you can go and get a meal like this for under 10$ - and expect left overs. the staff are super friendly and it's a great atmosphere.  definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"won't be coming back.  the food was not bad and the servings were big, BUT the service was terrible. We arrived and ordered, after 30 minutes our appetizer arrived. she had gotten the order wrong. We waited another 30 minutes for the rest of our food to come, it was not that great."}
{"text":"I was on my way to a potluck dinner and I wanted to grab something on the way. I normally don't order from vegetarian restaurants, but I felt like trying something new.  I ordered takeout: Braised E-Fu Noodles and Singapore Style Turnip Cake ($13 total).   The hostess told me the wait will be 15 minutes.  40 minutes after, my takeout was ready. I was not pleased because of the long wait. The restaurant was not busy which made me even more restless.  The food was delicious which made up for the time wasted.  Pros - Cheap (cheaper and same great quality as the restaurants further down at Dundas/Spadina) - Delicious  Cons - Long wait for takeout  Would I go back? I would as long as they don't keep me waiting like this visit."}
{"text":"Delicious! A refreshing place - clean and bright dining room, great service, and authentic Chinese vegetarian food. Try some soups or cold platters for appetizers - or the bean curd skin, which is perfectly cooked, light and soft on the inside with a touch of crispiness on the outside and just enough oil to be tasty but not overly greasy. The noodle soups are OK - light and clean, not bad, but I would recommend the specialty dishes if it's your first time, since you can get noodle soups at many places. In particular, the \"pi pa tofu\" is a gem - difficult to master, Greens Vegetarian Restaurant pulls it off just right. It's piping hot balls of mashed stuffed tofu (but not just any regular kind), golden brown on the outside, while delectable and soft on the inside, very tender, and stuffed with just the right balance of aromatic mushrooms and finely chopped vegetables. The sauce comes separate so the pieces don't get soggy. Complement the meal with tea and steamed rice, of course. They also offer bubble tea - which is not that sweet, probably because it is made with fresh ingredients like mango, and not the sugary powdered version. Sometimes one wants the sugary version though... This place is right next door to Buddha's Vegetarian, which is also a great Chinese vegetarian restaurant, and a block from Ching Kwok Buddhist Temple, for those who have never visited a traditional Chinese Buddhist temple and want to check it out. Conveniently located on the edge of Chinatown with lots of public transit."}
{"text":"IT is delicious! the fried taro biscuits was melt in your mouth. perfectly crispy. Huge portions. Super friendly staff, probably only  a few cooks hence sometimes slower services, but super nice people and delicious. ONLY WISHED they were open later  Delicious, i'm drooling now, thinking of it. mmm taro cakes!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I just couldn't! Perhaps being chinese with a vegetarian mom has made my pallet very selective.   The food variety was HUGE. It would help if they had pictures on the menu though.   Food was alright, full of msg and starch but I'm not really complaining.  I would come back to try the chicken nuggets and stir fried rice noodles with my mom.  Food portion is huge btw."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place; we go through phases where we'll go multiple times a week before taking a break.   Some evenings can be very busy, especially on Tuesdays when Buddha's up the street is closed, so try and have patience with the girls on the floor! This also means food can arrive, as one reviewer has already put it, \"lackadaisically\" but I find that's par for the course with Chinese restaurants.  DO: Soups; the soups are amazing. There is a section for soups at the front of the menu but flip all the way to the back and you'll see a page for \"noodle soups\". These soups are all around 3.99 and they are the large size; I get a mixed vegetable noodle soup and have it all to myself and it's all I can do to finish it.  Spring Rolls; a little greasy but nice and crunchy and a good size Fried Wontons; can be hit or miss, but you get 10 in an order which is good. (tip: dip them in your soup!) Fried rices; yum Fresh Bubble Teas: they are SO GOOD.   DON'T: Pad Thai; we didn't have high hopes since this is not a Thai restaurant. We should have trusted our instincts.  Eggplant Black Bean: I've only tried this once and it was very greasy, I didn't finish it.   All in all, this is one of my favorite places, but BE WARNED: it's closed on Wednesdays. Nothing is worse than getting all worked up for soup and then remembering what day of the week it is. Derp."}
{"text":"This is my favourite vegan restaurant in Toronto. Especially after White Lotus on Landsowne closed :( The service is incredible. The waitress and owner are so kind and helpful-even after I had my youngest child, my parents went in to buy food, they recognized my children and gave them more food as gifts of congratulations. Where else!!?!! The food is great-not too heavy (like one of it's neighbours), flavourful and I'm sure they don't use MSG. I can go in for a filling meal for less than $10 for myself and 2 children. Their soups are so good, great for warm or cooler weather.."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian interested in vegan cuisine, I read good things about Greens through yelp and was quite intrigued by their menu. A friend (meat eater) and I visited the restaurant on Sunday the 16th of October a bit before 4 pm without a reservation.   Restaurant:  Not to big of a restaurant, clean, nice decor. Very clean, modern, but tiny women's bathroom (two stalls/one sink). Our table already had chopsticks, condiments (salt, pepper, soy sauce,   & vinegar), and non disposable chopsticks/plates/bowls with spoons set up. Big windows and a TV playing Cp24.   Service:  We were quickly greeted by a server, and as there were only a couple other people dining at the time, we had our choice of seating. The service was slow as I think there was only one server at the time, but she was polite. Throughout the meal as the restaurant got busier the service was a bit slower. It took us a few minutes to find someone to get the bill at the end of our meal. We received two delicious guava hard candies with the bill.   Food: We were immediately brought a complimentary teapot filled with green tea and two small cups. The tea was piping hot and tasty. We asked for two glasses of water, which were chilled nicely. We also ordered two dishes to share as the dishes are served family style (although you don't have to share) that were both just under $10: the deep fried mock chicken in lemon sauce, and the fried rice noodles with mock beef. Our food came out not too long after ordering, however they came out a few minutes apart. The portion sizes for each dish were a good/ generous size.   The lemon chicken was  a bit less \"lemony\" then I expected, but very good and filling. The fried rice noodles with mock beef contained less mock beef then I expected, which although was quite bland on it's own, had a  chewy texture similar to real beef. The noodles were good but a bit blander then expected, but tasted way more flavorful with the red chili sauce included separately with the dish. The chili sauce was very spicy but strong in flavour. The rice noodles are flat though so they were kind of difficult to pick up with chopsticks/utensils as they kept slipping out, which was kind of bothersome to me.   I'd order the lemon chicken again, but wouldn't order the noodles again next time simply due to the fact that I'd want to try another one of their noodle dishes. I recommend trying these two dishes though.    Overall, my friend and I enjoyed both dishes; and left feeling quite full. I'd recommend this restaurant to others to try due to the overall good food, decent price, and portion size; and would be interested in visiting again to try out some of their other items."}
{"text":"This place is CHEAP! We were meant to go to one another restaurant but it was closed and the food we could see from the window looked so good we decided to give it a try. I've never eaten much imitation chicken etc but the imitation sweet and sour chicken we tried tasted pretty much exactly like the real thing- anything deep friend and covered in sauce is good I guess!  The wait staff were really nice even though we can close to closing- they actually stayed open for us!  The cold vietnamese noodles were good too but not the best I'd had.  Spring-roll plater has lots of rolls but only a little mango salad.   Would def suggest trying it out."}
{"text":"First time in this place, we finally went out after waiting for more than 30 minutes for two plates. Worst service I've ever experienced in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have visited green's vegetarian restaurants multiple time. My dining experiences have been very consistent:    Overall, the food is delicious and I am always impressed with the portion. It is an excellent choice for food if you are tight on cash but very hungry.   My favourite combination is the small hot and sour soup ($3.99) with a spring roll ($1.69). The spring is freshly made on the spot and significantly larger than other Chinese restaurants'. Most of other Chinese restaurants serve spring rolls that are frozen before cook. Vegetables are fresh! The presentation of dishes is very nice as well.  However, I don't recommend the mock meat dishes, I have ordered #40 (don't remember the name) and the lemon \"chicken\" before, both dishes were quite under seasoned and deep fried in oil. Another problem I have with the dishes here is that I am quite positive that Green's is NOT MSG free. I sometimes can taste it in the vegetable stir fry dishes.   Moving on to the atmosphere and service, the restaurant is brightly lit and very clean. However the down side is that the servers are very slow. I do think it's their personality though, they are just very slow, relaxed, friendly people. But still, 25 min for dishes to arrive (one by one, not even altogether) is a little bit too long of a wait when I am hungry. The language skill of the servers is somewhat limited so sometimes customers arrive at the door but are not hosted to the table right away because only the owner's English is good enough to direct customers."}
{"text":"We ordered food from here and it was ok. Their portions are big! So you can probably have some leftovers. The noodles were nice and the spicy tofu was ok but everything else (especially the fried tofu) was kind of bland and meh. Probably wouldn't order from here again but if I did, I'd get the fried noodles."}
{"text":"I had high hopes coming in this new place after reading the reviews.  It is kids friendly and the ladies that works there are very accommodating and friendly.  Very affordable.  The food was okay and a little too oily.  Service was a little slow but the plate was large."}
{"text":"Great selection and taste. Cheap price with good value. We are regular eaters there. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been to Greens twice, once to eat there and once for take out. I was not disappointed either time. I bought the shanghai noodles, lemon chicken, mushroom noodles, mango salad, and spicy chicken (all mock meat). It's great food and very friendly staff. Will be going back definitely."}
{"text":"Only 2 other tables were occupied when we arrived.  One was waiting for takeout which may have been the reason why we waited a while for our food.  I wasn't sure what was going to arrive with my  egg noodle dish with mock duck.  The mock duck was big chunks of what looks and tastes like bean curd.  My friend ordered the noodles with mock chicken.  Smaller pieces of bean curd that tasted the same to me.  Both of our dishes had the same vegetables - bok choy, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli.  The people at the table beside us ordered a tofu dish - which was huge and they were taking it home as leftovers and another dish which was vegetables on top of a crispy taro nest  that looked interesting.  The prices are decent - in fact the paper menu even had some prices crossed out with new lower prices, place wasn't very busy on a Saturday night and clean updated decor - not your typical noisy ambiance from Chinese restaurants.  This place is a good alternative if you're in the neighbourhood for vegetarian cuisine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both vegan and this is one of our regular places to go.   We always start out with Hot and Sour soup with spring rolls on the side.  I would love to try the other soups but I love this soup too much.  It's a perfect level hot spicy and they don't go overboard with the tofu (like a lot of places do).  For our main course we usually just split the Mock Beef with Rice Noodle dish.  The servings are massive and we usually have leftovers.  The mock beef is really good and I love how simple the dish is.  I could do with a little less oil, but that's just me.  My boyfriend loves it as is.    The prices are amazing and the portions are more than generous.  The service is usually pretty good.  We never have to wait for a table either which is nice.  Although, I know they can get pretty busy, we just end up there at the 'slower' times.  I would recommend this place to anyone that is vegan, vegetarian or just likes Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'd give 5 stars because the food was delicious, but the service wasn't the best. We ordered bubble tea and  soft drinks (thinking that they might serve them before the meal) but after we ordered and because we asked, the told us it was going to take at least 20 min. The soft drink were served by the end of the meal, and water was never delivered. Very disappointing, I understand that they were busy, but we didn't ask for anything complicated, just drinks because we were thirsty."}
{"text":"Ordered from doordash. Their sweet and sour chicken balls are great but the rest of dishes I got were pretty disapointing, not enough veggies or fake meat in the noodle dishes it's 90% noodle with only a couple bits of veggies and mock meat"}
{"text":"Portions are super big and perhaps that's the only plus at this place. If you by chance manage to order an entree that you like you might have ample leftovers for your lunch next day."}
{"text":"There's little to criticize here except the mediocre setting and the bathroom. But the selection is great and the food is excellent (been here many times). Wonderful place for vegans to eat Chinese. Hot and sour soup reminds me of what I had in China. Stir-fry vegetables and tofu has a tasty sauce. For some reason, rice is always slow. Recommended."}
{"text":"I like their cabbage filled springrolls.  They don't use garlic in their cooking.  They are obliging to make alterations to dishes.  A lot of their dishes have wheat gluten.   I must say that I am getting tired of the wheat gluten thing."}
{"text":"You go to Greens  for a very good casual Chinese food experience which also happens to be vegan.   I absolutely adore and am totally addicted to G's salt and pepper mushrooms (crispy and salty on the outside, chewy and juicy on the inside) and the turnip cakes (flavourful \"tater\" tots that will make you forget about potatoes for a moment). I highly recommend both dishes.   Shout out to the the crispy chow mein, hot and sour and cream of corn soups. Always tasty and satisfying.   Honorable mention goes to the chili \"chicken\" nuggets. This dish used to be outstanding but the nugget product used has changed over time and it's just not the same.   We come to G's at least once per month and the food here is consistently good."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch using DoorDash. I got the lunch special which came with soup and a large spring roll. Also the stuffed pan fried bean curd as an extra.  This was supposed to be your vegan Chinese food. It's true, it is. It's your typical take put minus the fried meat but not sure if it was satisfying. I only enjoyed the spring roll. My main dish was supposed to have mock meat but it didn't have much. It was mostly veggies. The mock meat didn't really taste/feel like meat so you can't fool an omnivore. The pan fried bean curd had greens, mushrooms, and dried fungus? While at first it was nice, your jaw can get tired quickly after chewing through all that fiber.  Tldr: Super affordable lunch that tastes like your typical, not so flavourful, Chinese take out. You can't fool an omnivore with their mock meat."}
{"text":"Friendly, welcoming staff, good food, great service for a reasonable price.  Atmosphere is bright, clean & modern, even the washrooms are clean!  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I appreciate meat. But Green's makes it easy to appreciate other things too.  This is one of the only places I've ever been where the mock meat doesn't require a desperate stretch of imagination to replace meat. The dishes are tasty, and some are delightfully cheap.  I would especially recommend the soups. Their hot and sour is very good, and their noodle soups are amazing value (~$4 for enough food for two meals... that's $2/meal!)  The servers also make a point to be polite and friendly, which is rare in cheap Chinese restos but certainly welcome; decor is likewise nicer than average (no white garbage bags \"tablecloths\")  Food vs price: 5/5 Service + ambience: 4/5  I will be back repeatedly for a cheap, reliable source of vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I used to be a sworn fan of Buddha's next door. Then Green's opened.  HOLY MOLY. This place is amazing! I don't know how they do it, but they somehow manage to have fantastic decor, absolutely delicious food, and it's ridiculously cheap! This place makes me want to move down the street and never cook again. $10 (tip included) for a meal enough for two? How is this possible? And the waitress here, she used to work at Buddha's and she was cranky there, she's always smiling here. For mock-meat this is the best place there is, I've fooled more than one omnivore with the sight and smell of their \"meat\". Oh, and the taste and portions are unrivaled."}
{"text":"This secluded spot near the curve in Dundas across from Ryerson Public School had a Thai food restaurant for years that was well known with a good reputation in the market and beyond. When they closed, a vegetarian restaurant opened up in its place. The bad news was that the food was lacklustre at best and we didn't go back. A child hanging out near the kitchen there was eating McDonalds takeout which we knew wasn't a good sign. Greens Vegetarian Restaurant has occupied the spot for the last couple of years and my first meal there recently was scrumptiously good! Everything was so obviously fresh. It made my day-to-day food pale by comparison. They must have some way or knack to doing this because it doesn't happen by accident. The menu is large and comprehensive with many different asian influenced dishes emulated and surpassing some meat based equivalents I've tried. I was told that the chef had come from Buddha's Restaurant nearby and that explains the quality of the dishes. Beautifully cooked noodles presented artfully piping hot and made to order. This was the first time I can remember that I used soya sauce on noodles to add a little bit of saltiness, rather than getting my tastebuds assaulted with too much of the same. The won ton soup was delicious with tender wrappings on the dumplings and crunchy goodness inside. Along with the earthy taste of spinach leaves in the broth, the soup was a welcome warm treat! A substantial appetizer or main seemed popular among the diners there that Sunday night was a tofu ball which was coated and presented in a ring around an overturned bowl's worth of the freshest steamed broccoli anyone could imagine... To go with the tofu balls was a sublime savoury brown sauce sprinkled with diced bits of mushroom. With a delicate flavour that belied its looks, the sauce complimented the tofu and made the dish the hit it is. The restaurant interior had been redone with Greens and sports a modern, streamlined, asian-influenced look and has the traditional round tables, a practical and elegant setting with sprawling picture windows, crystal clear, helping to make this a jewel of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Pros: * Reasonably priced * Huge servings * Loads of variety on the menu (noodle dishes, rice dishes, all sorts of stuff) * Very clean, nice decor * Generally decent service  Cons: * Quality of the meals varies wildly - I was disappointed with my kung pow 'chicken' (the soymeat was bland-o-riffic), but other people I was with had interesting meals with great flavour all-round. * The menu is pretty non-descriptive, so beyond basic obvious stuff like pad thai or fried rice, you have to wing it to decide * Even though there's double-doors it gets pretty chilly by the front of the restaurant  Overall I think if the meals were of a more consistent quality I could bump this up to an average three stars (cheap large meals and convenient location can't trump this). When about a 1/3 of the people i'm dining with are looking wistfully at other people's meals because they're disappointed, there's not much that can be done. I would probably go back and order something i'd seen people enjoy, but not to pick blindly again."}
{"text":"I was invited here by two of my vegan friends for dinner (myself being a pescatarian). We must have ordered at least 7 different items, with every single dish being delicious, though a few items were a bit oily. Though there is still much more I would like to try, my current favourites would be the Pad Thai, Wonton Soup and Fried Vegetable Dumplings."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by vegetarian friends so I had high hopes.   Food was decent in terms of taste as would be expected. Got the spicy egg plant and green bean dish which I enjoyed.   My friend got the mango salad and it looked bland. Him being a meat eater was none too impressed with the salad and his noodles. I was quite content with me food  The portions are very generous.   Staff were good as one can imagine from such an establishment. Not being rude is the only thing I look for at these joints.   Only downfall was that I came specifically for the turnip dish as I had seen it on Yelp!  Server said it would take 2 hrs for them to make it as they make it from scratch. WHO has waited 2 hrs for this dish please make yourself known? Was it worth it? Tell me you lucky bastard.   Sad to not have been able to try that.   Would def recommend this place. Got parking right across with no probs on a Saturday during peak hrs."}
{"text":"All I can say is Wow - this was my first time trying a vegetarian restaurant and I really enjoyed it.  I avoided veggie restaurants in the past assuming the food would be sub-par and only for salad and broccoli lovers -  I was wrong.   ATTENTION MEAT LOVERS - you will enjoy the food here, just give it a try!  Thanks  to Val G. for organizing the \"Git your Greens On\" UYE and JK for encouraging me to go -  I will definitely eat and enjoy vegetarian food again.     Since we were a large group, we ordered lots of different dishes to share. Pricing is incredible - It worked out to approximately $12 a person. A quick recap of what we ordered:  - Hot and Sour soup:  very good but maybe a little too much tofu for me.  - Mixed veggies - Fresh veggies cooked perfectly, I could eat this with rice and be a happy camper.  - Deep fried lemon chicken (but not really chicken): surprisingly good and tastes somewhat like the real thing. The lemon sauce makes for am excellent pairing.  - A dish that reminded me off Sweet and sour Pork (but without the pork): Loved it, tasted like the pork version but much healthier for you.  - Curry noodles: Also a great dish and the imitation beef looks & tastes like real meat - how the hell do they do that?   - Eggplant and tofu: Good fresh eggplant - so tasty. Not super oily like many traditional chinese restaurants.  - We ended with a a final tofu dish (kind of like a soup) - the only dish I wasn't too crazy about.    A delicious meal at a great price - what more can you ask for? Added bonus - meeting some cool new yelpers.  BK"}
{"text":"What happened??!?!  We have visited Greens many times and enjoyed our meals immensely until our last visit about a month ago.      Our favourite, Singapore style fried turnip cakes, (savoury crispy salty spicy curried nuggets of goodness) were so bland, as was the hot and sour soup and the assorted gluten platter.  I had to \"doctor\" the soup with vinegar and chili sauce, and the gluten literally had no taste.  These dishes were always flavourful and tasty in the past so I'm not sure what happened.  I also ordered several takeout dishes for my sister and she said that except for \"chicken\" lettuce wraps, everything else was tasteless.  We were so sad and disappointed because we loved Greens.  Now, I am not sure we will return."}
{"text":"This is my fav veggie joint in all of the GTA!! I am never disappointed!!   They have an incredible hot and sour soup! I love love love the fried rice dishes and the mock chicken stuff too :)  I wish they had hot pot dishes :(   Non-veggies will love this place!! Definitely a must eat!!"}
{"text":"Visited here on the spur of the moment as we were passing by and was very happy with our choice. I wasn't particularly hungry when we arrived but my order was so delicious, I preceded to eat it all. Portions were generous too. Recommended."}
{"text":"This place super yummy and cheap vegetarian asian food. I went with a group that included vegetarians, a vegan and us meat eaters. We ordered numerous dishes and shared. The food came out fairly fast and always fresh and hot (even the huge homemade spring rolls). The plates were all very generous servings (especially the soups), especially for the price. My favourites were spring rolls, Sautéed bok choy and mushrooms (#27 I think), sweet and sour mock chicken, and the spicy thai noodles (when you added the spicy sauce they give you, it' not spicy without it). We weren't huge fans of the fried tofu balls (#48 i think). they were ok but there were too many and they were huge so a bit over powering, but if you're a huge tofu fan you'd probably love them. Also the curry pad thai was a little bland.   Overall great food, amazing price, easy location, quick attentive service and good decor (don't let the tired exterior mislead you its nice inside). It was great for everyone, even the meat eaters were satisfied and happy despite the lack of meat. In the end I left so full I almost felt sick and including tax and tip it was $13."}
{"text":"Greens, greens, good for the heart.  From time to time, I get inexplicable cravings for greasy but satisfying vegetarian Chinese food, and Greens really fills that void in my life. We got four dishes as take-out to split between three people, and it was more than enough food for each of us to get at least two solid meals out of it, whilst also being super affordable.   The fried rice noodles with mock beef was my jam, but I could see how it would quickly get tiresome if you were only eating that. Blatantly the best thing to do is to roll in with a crew and mix and match dishes running the spectrum from vegetable-based to mock meat to rice/noodles."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here when we are hungover and eat ungodly amount of mock chicken. I can't decide what's better, the crispy chicken nuggets in chili sauce? Lemon chicken? Sweet corn and mock chicken soup? Why decide when you can order it all and feed two hungry hungover vegans into a two day coma for under $50. That gets a five star from me!!!"}
{"text":"I admit the idea of going to a vegetarian restaurant usually doesn't interest me much. I'm a big meat lover, and if a dish doesn't have meat in it I feel like I'm missing something. In an effort to eat less meat my boyfriend and I went here when he recommended this place.  If I was a vegetarian I would have been very happy and probably given this place 4 stars. However, at the heart of things, I love me some meat.   We ordered the mixed mushroom and vegetable dish and Singapore style fried turnip cake. The mushroom dish was flavourful and had a lot of depth for an all veggie dish. I was surprised that there was so much flavour. The mushrooms and veggies were all cooked really nicely.The turnip cake was spiced with curry and the texture of the cake was interesting. It reminded me of sticky rice a bit.   If you are looking for a vegetarian option, check out this place out. They have a lot of tofu and meat like options as well."}
{"text":"Spacious restaurant with a good amount of seating. Came around 1:30 for lunch on a Saturday and it was empty, but it's kind of out of the way from Chinatown as well.  Interior is maintained and looks clean and tidy. Washrooms are also clean.  Menu offers a good selection of vegetarian options. It's not too different from a typical Chinese restaurant menu, perhaps with a few different ingredients in some of the dishes.  Portions are pretty big. Consider splitting dishes with others if going in a group.  If you're looking for a vegan place and don't want to spend too much, this is probably one of the more affordable options compared to other places I've seen."}
{"text":"They have messed up my take out order on several occasions and tried to blame it on the customer. Don't have different prices listed on the website and menu. One time I walked in to pick up my food and the lady notices me and takes my container to the back to tell me they're \"making it fresh\" no big deal but don't be so sketch around my food. Since I've been eating at Buddhas down the street, bigger portions and better value for you money."}
{"text":"Yet another gem found in a jam pack city. So many times have I passed this small unassuming restaurant - perhaps, something flashier and trendier or perhaps to satisfy my carnivorous desires...but last night we decided venture into a new territory to say that we did. I, for one, am glad we did. Discreet on the outside, clean but barely decorated on the inside. This place left a lasting impression with their offerings. This restaurant offers the typical Chinese food but done right, fresh and oh so good-plot twist: it's a strictly vegetarian restaurant. I wouldn't go as far as say that it's super healthy or good for you, but when it's a vegetarian restaurant that makes me want to keep coming back for more, they are definitely doing it right-mind you, we mindfully chose not to be healthy. In all the deep fried glorious goodness, we enjoyed the crispy mock duck noodles, a fried taro fish with sweet and sour sauce, and tofu and vegetable croquettes covered in vermicelli and deep fried served in with a mushroom gravy. All our guilty pleasures now featuring in vegetarian form. Portion and price was impressively affordable. The food was served very mindful of dinners' preferences- the sauces were all served on the side rather than drizzled over. It made for packing and eating leftover so much more appealing. The noodles were crispy and utilized the deep umami taste of mushroom as a base for its gravy. The veg on top was vibrant in color and freshly crisp. The gravy (also the same served with the deep fried tofu) has depth and balanced. The mock duck was a just simple bean curd sheets rolled but carried a smoky finish to the dish. The taro fish was a little denser than I would've preferred but the soft denseness was nice contracted by its crispy exterior. The sweet and sour sauce took the dish up a notch and brought vibrancy (both in taste and visual appeal). The star player was the tofu croquettes. They increased the crispiness factor by rolling it in flour prior to its oil bath, added vermicelli to add crunch to the shell and texture as well as structure to the inside. Tofu, peas, and carrots added substance to the croquette. Served with the mushroom gravy to pull it altogether.  Overall, the meal was well worth the trip and price of admission. Deliciously prepared, and well received. Service was typically of an Asian restaurant-servers were no means talkative but we got what we needed when we asked. They were even nice enough to showcase the Jays game for those interested in enjoying it with the meal. Definitely worth and try and coming back for."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I went with my aunt who loves this place and she ordered everything so I am going to describe the dish but can't for the life of me tell you what it's called on the menu.  First, great place for vegans. They really take their vegetarian label seriously. Everything is tofu - we were there for a birthday party and couldn't bring in a cake because there were eggs in it! Props!  We started with fried wontons - really crispy with a nice mushroom and tofu filling.  Hot and sour soup - so worth it! It's just the right amount of sour and spicy, although, sadly as a meat eater, I do prefer the version with pork at other places (please don't hate me). They had fake duck - pan fried tofu sheets ... Money in the bank. I could have just eaten that all day and night and the next day. I don't know what these were called but they were deep fried twists and inside were soft gluten balls. OMG. Just kill me now. A-mah-zing. Order 2 portions. Do it. We also had noodles (not really my thing. Were super chewy) and black rice. Deep fried soft tofu balls - the sauce makes it but instead of dipping it in the mushroom sauce, ask for their house hot sauce. YUM!  I mean everything here was deep fried or fried fried... Maybe that's why everything is so tasty because everything tastes better crispy. There's a lot of MSG in the food, I guess that's the toss up to having no animal fat!  I'd go back, maybe skimp on the deep friedness a little next time.  Go tofu!"}
{"text":"Greens is my new favourite vegetarian Chinese restaurant. They used to be Full Moon Vegetarian but they changed owners and renovated last year and it's been a huge improvement!  They serve a lot of 'traditional' chinese food dishes that you might get at meat-serving Chinese restaurants such as sweet 'n sour chicken balls. I never really ate meat so this has given me a chance to try these dishes.  The best dish on the menu is far and away the Lemon Chicken(order with a side of rice). The sweet lemon sauce is so good on the crispy fried batter. If you get a soup, expect it to be huge. A medium is only $3.99, which is crazy ridiculous cheap.    Pretty much everything is very affordable and the portions size are really good.   It's a great place for groups too. I once had 30 people here for a dinner and sharing dishes was great and very affordable. I shared with about 7 people sitting near me and we had each ordered a dish, plus a soup and the total came to $11 with tax and tip per person.  If you haven't tried Greens, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Pretty decent vegetarian restaurant! I ordered the mock sweet and sour chicken, which was amazing! Split the mock duck noodles with my friend, which was good (but I've never had duck so I guess I can't really compare it to the real thing). I've seen past reviews mention that the service was slow but I didn't find that to be an issue at all - they were super helpful and attentive. The portions are big for what you pay, so overall I think it's worth it if you like vegetarian food and know what to order (i.e.: the mock sweet and sour chicken)."}
{"text":"A worthy challenge to the more established HK Buddhist Vegetarian eatery up the street. Full marks for quality of ingredients, presentation, cleanliness, service and value. The hot and sour soup has depth and is not over-powered with vinegar. The fried rice and noodle dishes are quite balanced and not greasy. Some items are less successful and lack seasoning (e.g. the mock meats and wheat glutens; wonton dumplings), but I suspect this kitchen is mindful of using too much sodium in its food. (I certainly feel less thirsty after eating here than most other places.)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Chinese food in Toronto. The food is amazing and portions are big for what you pay. This place could convince even the heaviest meat-eater that vegetarian food can be delicious too.   Also the serving staff are super friendly and nice.  Try out the sweet and sour mock chicken and the vegetables with cashews!"}
{"text":"My GF introduced me to this place this past Friday night. We ordered 3 items - lemon chicken, Ho Fun noodles with mock beef, and tofu & eggplant in black bean sauce. The mock lemon chicken was flawlessly reminiscent of the lemon chicken I adored as a child. The other two dishes were full of flavour and all three dishes were copiously filled - fantastic portions considering the price.  There's a picture of the tofu/eggplant dish in the \"Are these photos helpful?\" section right below where I'm typing right now, and my mouth is watering crazily. I'm super excited to go back and eventually try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a lunch event with friends. Joked that our first New Year Resolution was to eat healthy. Not a fan of non-meat restaurant, but this place wasn't too bad. Ordered Bamboo Fungus King Mushroom & Tofu Soup, Crispy Noodles with Mixed Vegetables, Vermicelli in Hot & Sour Soup, Deep Fried Sweet Potato, Eggplant with Tofu in Black Bean Sauce, Mixed Vegetable Fried Rice and Deep Fried Taro Fish with Sweet Sour Sauce.  I highly recommend the Vermicelli in Hot & Sour Soup for 5.99, you get an enormous bowl. Loved eating the Crispy Noodles with Mixed Vegetable because it tasted like Cantonese Noodle without the meat.  I would avoid the sweet potato as it wasn't worth 3.99 for the amount of size and the plain taste."}
{"text":"First of all, don't be fooled by the prices! They are incredibly reasonable so you might be tempted to over order.   The portion sizes are HUGE. I had the deep fried tofu balls. These were handmade and fresh. Tofu and egg with veggies lightly battered. Something I've never even fathomed could exist. There were at least a dozen on my plate. You'll be lucky if you can eat 5.  All in all, a great place for lunch. Everything was made fresh and it showed!"}
{"text":"We only ordered one dish, the vegetarian fried rice, so this review probably doesn't reflect how  good the restaurant is.  The fried rice was good though.  At first we thought the slices of green veggies were onions, but they were actually some other delicious vegetable that added crunch and flavor to the dish."}
{"text":"Me and my vegan homies have come here several times and always left stuffed to the gills  and happy.  Please, please order their \"chicken\" ball things. I had one and nearly died from the deliciousness.   The staff are very friendly and hard-working, even if they are a bit overstretched at times.  My favourite dish is probably the lettuce wraps. I also appreciate that they have seaweed salad on the menu.  Is this a fancy restaurant? Hyellll nah. Is it somewhere I would go back to and take a friend? Absolutely."}
{"text":"This is my second consecutive year trying to go this restaurant on New Year's Eve. Last year, they said they were too busy and request us to go somewhere else. This year, they were too busy to sit us down, and definitely too busy to clear existing tables from customers who left a long time ago.  After waiting 15 mins, we decided to just sit at a uncleared table and check out the menu. During this time, the restaurant was full, but half the restaurant was waiting for its food, and the other half almost done. Note to self, expect a long wait for food.  Another 15 mins later, they cleared the table and brought us tea. During this time, the phone orders rings non-stop. Orders keep coming in, waiter keeps turning away customers, telling them 'we have too many orders'. One waiter broke a plate while clearing dishes. The same waiter dropped a pot of ready to be served food on the floor maybe 30 mins later.   We ordered: Crisp Soya Fritters, Fried Rice Noodle w/ mock beef, Mock Chicken with Salted Mock Fish Fried Rice, and Preserved Veg and Mock Soya Meat w/ Vermicelli in Soup. That took about half an hour between ordering to getting the the first plate of food.   Crisp Soya Fritters is the biggest disappointment. Though I am not a vegetarian, but for the same price, I think you can get much bigger and more pieces of popcorn chicken at popeyes by comparison. The fried rice noodles w/ mock beef and mock chicken w/ salted mock fish fried rice were subpar in comparison to Buddha (just right next door). There's absolutely no 'wok-hea' in any of its dishes. mock salted fish is just does not taste like the real thing. Not a very good imitation. As for the Preserved veg and mock soya meat? Never got that at all, they delivered vermicelli in hot and sour soup instead. Not a big fan of hot and sour soup in the first place, but they were already so busy. I feel bad making them remake it. Overall, food portions are much smaller (as in, one plate of food was enough for eating but not enough leftovers to take home) than expected given the yelp reviews.  Lastly, to pay the bill, I stood in front of the cash area waiting for another 15mins before one waiter was free enough.   I think this place has only one winning aspect, which is its decor. It is brighter, looks better than Buddha (and many other chinese restaurant around chinatown). I think the cons for this place outweighs the pros. Terrible value for money in terms of taste, food portions, and wait times. This is a perfect example of 'appearance can be deceiving'"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good portions, and the food itself was pretty good! Service was on the slow side though. It took around 40 minutes for the food that myself and my girlfriend ordered to come out. Try the mixed vegetable fried rice! It's to die for."}
{"text":"This place is worth visiting if your into vegan/vegetarian food. The food is tasty and the servings are well portioned that we still had leftovers after the meal! Price point is inexpensive so its not bad to bring in a bunch of people.   This is purely an asian inspired cuisine so if your looking for something savoury then this is the place to eat.   Would definitely go back in the future!"}
{"text":"omg the soups. just go for the noodle soups on the last page.  i hate vegetarian restaurants that put some much soy crap in your meal and don't serve vegetables. the soups are SO full of vegetables. it makes me unexplainably happy. it's also amazing that you get two/three meals out of one bowl of soup that costs like $4.50.   seating is really nice. def not a hole in the wall feeling.   fast, friendly service in my experience.   the mock duck was a huge let down though (compared to the lovely stuff at kings in kensington)."}
{"text":"I just can't emphasize enough how lovely the people who work here are. And the food is just delicious. You will find your favorites and become a regular like me in no time. It's just heavenly."}
{"text":"Looking to try a new vegan restaurant in the downtown area so Yelp came up with here.  Although we also try to avoid soy and sugar in our diet, that is difficult here... So for us this was decent \"junk food\".  It was interesting to have Sweet and Sour Mock Chicken... when I haven't eaten meat in years... It was very much like the real thing... Even better I think.  We also has the wonton soup (very good! ) and the veggie fried rice (normal), as well as the 3 mushroom and seasonal veggie dish (yummy).    The decor is newly done and is quite nice... the insides don't match the signage outside... You'll be pleasantly surprised when you walk in.  Service is decent... Polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place to go with my family for Chinese New Year that's relatively downtown.   My family is the one that likes their chow mein crunchy but greasy and the usual veggie deep fried goodies during this season.   I was here this past Chinese New Year with 5 for dinner - MAKE A RESERVATION FOR SPECIAL DATES. Thankfully I made one, but we would of had to wait about half an hour for a spot (not too shabby, but too long if you're with your parents haha).   We ate a lot, but my picks that you HAVE to get: Bamboo Fungus Soup - The bamboo in this soup is crunchy and so bomb.   Mixed Mushrooms in Taro Nest -  Cashews and mushrooms are the best combo. The celery makes you feel like you're super zen and healthy eating this.   Deep Fried Taro - not too oily, slightly crunchy, and the taro is 100%.   It's a bit more pricey than your average Chinatown restaurant, but it's well worth it if your finding a place for your Asian festivities."}
{"text":"Had the lemon mock chicken, green beans and sweet and sour mock chicken delivered. Though the postions were huge the quality was terrible. The green beans were very good, but the bland battered tofu feel of the 'mock' chicken dishes were so disappointing and both were very similar just with a different shape and sauce (both very sweet and flavourless). Sorry Greens I really wanted to like you, but I probably won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Outstanding Chinese vegetarian restaurant.  Nothing austere here.  Huge menu.  Enormous servings.  Strongly flavored dishes.  Lots of exotica.  (This is the first time I have seen mock kidney on a menu anywhere. Maybe I have just been too sheltered.)  Interesting personality choices in the execution of dishes.  Hot and Sour soup is made with a part tomato base - a decision which changes everything.  Vegetarian pancakes don't need an ounce of sauce although the sweet and hot sauce that comes with them is not unpleasant.  Plenty of hearty dishes on the menu both in the soup bowl department and in the plate department.  A fun and entertaining place which is good for you too.  Well maybe only half good for you.   After you scarf down all those heaping yummy plates of food, you will get fat.  However, if you get fat from eating vegetables it doesn't count as really being fat, right?"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced . Was in the restaurant for literally an hour and received no food. Got up and left . Go to buddahs"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now.  The five stars this place gets is for the price, quality and portions. It's definitely not gourmet dining, but it's excellent vegetarian Chinese food for so little money. A $7 entree could last you three meals (or split it three ways).   One weird thing about this place is that the menu items sound so much different than what they actually are. After coming here about 15 to 20 times I've figured out their menu and know what I like the most, but I would happily try anything offered. It's all good.   Some recommendations: - Salt Chicken - Taro Fish - Get a small soup unless you are splitting it with at least 4 people, or 2 people for a full meal. - Mock duck"}
{"text":"They sure are a lot of vegetarian restaurants to choose from in Toronto, but we're glad we chose this one.  And when you combine cheap and Asian too, what's not to like? I was feeling a little adventurous so in addition to the usual safe choices (comfort food), we tried the tofu ball and the turnip cake.  Interesting.  Really, if you're feeling open to new things, give it a try.  They were both pretty good. Service was quick and polite, too.  Descent atmosphere too."}
{"text":"finally tried, i'm a new comer in the vegetarian world and not going to lie its' hard! so after many reviews i decided to tried this place  i order first the crispy wonton, i was kind of disappointed by the taste, it was meh and the sauce was aight but it was really small even tho you have 10 pieces then came the pad thai...HUGE plate, almost regret to have tale a starter, was a battle to finish it! But the pad thai was really good, you had sone crispy tofu along and it goes really good overall.   I saw some other people took the the soup, which is cheap 5$, and the bowl was also enormous! so i will definitely come back for that!  recommend some place if you craving for some veggies and want for your money!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  Greens or Buddha...after going to Buddha a few times, I decided to try out Greens. The walk from the main area of Chinatown can be intimidating (you're passing by a social housing project site), but it's only about a 5 minute walk.  The soups, may I say, are some of the best I've had, right on par with Lotus Pond and Graceful up in the north end. The noodle dishes, however, lacked variety. I normally would order a seafood noodle dish, however they did not have them here. I ended up having the mixed mushroom noodle dish, which was decent...though the lack of variety really disappointed me at the end.  Service was excellent, but mainly because I came in when it was relatively quiet (before noon)."}
{"text":"I went here on a snow day, so a lot of the places in the area were closed. I was glad to find Greens. The service was pretty good, but there seemed to be a lot of people doing take-away orders so they seemed busy.  The food portions were very generous and were priced really well. The food tasted good and I would like to come back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here as a second choice. The place we had hoped to go to just west of this place was closed on Tuesdays. The place looked simple and clean. Staff were friendly. They even turned up the heat for us when it started to feel a bit chilly. Two of us came for dinner and we ordered the following:  * Crispy soya fritters - first time having these. They were tasty & had a great texture. Almost like biting into popcorn chicken. I would order it again. * Assorted gluten and being curd - nice plate to order if you want a variety of things. However, I found it wasn't that great. The taste was on the bland side & the mock duck wasn't as good as other places I've been. Don't think I'll order this again. * Mock chicken fried rice with cashew nuts - nice flavoring, not greasy or oily and lots of cashews. Yum! * sweet-and-sour mock chicken - very generous portion. Flavorful but I would have like just a little less batter around the mock chicken.  All in all, we had a good evening."}
{"text":"Great value and service.  10% off with TVA membership card.  They're very accommodating when you ask to amend items.  Portions are big."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover, and don't judge a restaurant by its storefront. From the outside Greens Vegetarian restaurant doesn't look like much, and when you get inside, nothing changes that perception.   However, the food changes everything. The wonton soup is generously filled with wontons, mixed vegetable dishes are cooked to perfection, and the deep fried sweet potato will blow your mind.  If you have never been to a vegetarian restaurant, this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"Thanks to the \"Git ur Greens On\" UYE put together by Val G, I had the excellent opportunity to feast heartily at lovely Greens Vegetarian Restaurant.   I've only ever dined at two other Asian (fusion?) vegetarian restos, those being Joe Yee's in RH and Vegetarian Haven in Kensington, and I have to say in terms of flavour Greens has to be my favorite hands down!  Greens is just a stone's throw away from the heart of Chinatown, at the corner of Dundas and Denison and boasts a clean and bright interior, and although I didn't make a trip to the lieu, Jen K assured me that it is indeed very presentable.  With the guidance of our hostess Val G as well as input from Andrew G, our distinguished group of diners shared dishes as diverse as Hot and Sour soup, Eggplant Tofu, an amazing rendition of mock Beef noodles whereby the texture of \"beef\" was superbly similar in flavour to the real thing and a heavenly Lemon mock Chicken, with a batter so crisp yet so weightlessly light without a hint of greasiness you won't believe it's fried!  We even had room for a hearty veggie style Ma Po Tofu stew with zesty bits of my favorite Sichuan zha cai pickles!    I'll say the best way to experience Greens is in a group setting, that way you get to order a nice sampling of generously portioned dishes.  Pricing wise a meal of around 7 dishes between the 7 of us came to $12 per head, which is very reasonable.    As deliciously decadent as Chinese food is, sometimes the grease and saltiness is too much to bear, not to mention the uncomfortable bloating and indigestion that sometimes follows, but thankfully I ended my meal at Greens feeling guiltlessly sated and comfortably full.  Much thanks to our Greens host Val G and Andrew for choosing a wonderful menu for us and introducing my taste buds to an excellent Asian vegetarian experience.  If you're a fan of Chinese food or are bored with the usual vegetarian dining offerings, I highly recommend you get your ass to Greens for some savoury Sino-fied veggie loving."}
{"text":"Slowwww service, but good food! It's an overall decent Chinese resto. Satisfying taste and good portions. Reasonably priced too. I enjoyed the king oyster mushroom w/ snow pea tips and Mao po tofu."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from most of the restaurant in Chinatown area but Greens Vegetarian Restaurant is definitely a nice surprise.  Clean, nicely decorated, spacious and even a clean washroom!!!  I really enjoyed most of the food we ordered and shared but I love carb and veggie than meat.  Hot and Sour Soup ($6.99) - has a lot of ingredients and a nice balance of hot and sour  Spring Roll Platter ($5.99) - love mango and rice paper roll  Eggplant with Tofu in Black Bean Sauce ($7.99) - love eggplant and the nice sauce  Deep Fried Mock Chicken in Lemon Sauce ($7.99) - meh  Sweet and Sour Mock Chicken ($8.99) - love sweet and sour sauce and the batter is light and crispy!  Spicy Ma Po Tofu ($7.99) - really bland tasting and too watery  Singapore Style Vermicelli ($5.99) and Fried Rice Noodle with Mock Beef ($5.99) - surprisingly tasty and with fresh of the wok flavour  Assorted Vegetables Dish ($7.99) - good and healthy choice!  Service here has a nice family vibe, though a little slow.  I will be back to Greens Vegetarian for some well prepared Chinese food. I might just skipped those mock meat and opt for the fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! heard the service was slow... But WOW.   I think the waitress needs a shot of B12 for her memory issues with our order.   Did I mention the service?    After 15 min of sitting waiting for a menu I put my stopwatch timer on and 40 minutes later our appetizer showed up.  The food was ok...   Try Buddhas down the block, better service and food."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible and slow service. Ate my Noodles and one veggie entree completely whole waiting for the second veggie entree I ordered at the same time. Will go back again but hope for better service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Pro: - great place for vegetarians  - huuuge portion and decent price ($15 per person for mock chicken, hot and sour soup, and noodles with mock duck) - lots of seating - short wait for food  Con: - the mock duck was not very good especially compared to some of the other mock meats I've had in the area. You can still see the tofu in its diced shape that's just inside a doughy ball.  - not a lot of vegetables, more noodles and does not resemble the photo in the menu at all    Verdict: it's an okay option for Chinese vegetarian food but Buddhas vegetarian food is just a couple of minutes walk away and food is much better although the decor and atmosphere is much worse. So if you want comfortable environment to eat and care less about the taste this place would be a better option! Also service here is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Buddha's was closed (whoops!) so we headed here to give it a try.  We were expecting to pay less but the prices were still totally decent.  Friendly but slow service.  Holy-Stomach-Growling-Batman!  I felt like everyone around us kept getting more & more food & we still had none.  Good food when it arrived lackadaisically.  On the bland side with no soy or hot sauce in sight to switch things up a bit.  Dinner was definitely affected negatively by screaming & running children from a nearby table who kept hitting our chairs.  I found the TV on in the corner a distracting element.  Good bland food.  I look forward to trying it again & seeing if maybe I can up the quality of my chosen dish."}
{"text":"Last night we decided to try a new vegetarian restaurant on Dundas Street, Greens Vegetarian Restaurant. We had eaten there before when it was Full Moon but the place had changed names and decor and we decided to see what it was like. The restaurant sits on the corner of Dundas and Denison with floor to ceiling glass windows that look on to both streets. The decor is minimal and stylish in a simple, straight-forward way. It had that slick Restaurant Makeover feel, a wall of faux 70s-styled faux bricks flanked by a long banquette with New York-style seating and some really funky square pinspot lights. Then there were a selection of simple tables for four lined along the glass windows looking out on Dundas Street. We opted for one of the tables for four along the wall of windows to enjoy the view of the street. The menu is all vegetarian, meaning we could order anything without any worries, with lots of faux-meat type dishes. We decided on a mixed appetizer plate of assorted tofu and gluten, a tofu and seaweed soup, some kung pao chicken and cashews, an eggplant and tofu dish and some mushroom fried rice. The portions are large and served on beautiful square white dishes that mirrored the rest of the style of the place. The food is basically simple Chinese fare (including sweet and sour chicken and lemon chicken) reinterpreted in a Buddhist vegetarian way like that found at Simon's Wok on Gerard Street or our long missed favourite Bo Dy Duyen. Everything was good even though we ordered more than we needed and it was a pleasure to enjoy the pleasant atmosphere, pleasant service and yummy food.  Update: Every time we eat here I wonder why don't eat there more often. It is always a pleasure to open a menu and to be able to order 'anything' and not worry about whether it is vegan friendly. The atmosphere is as relaxing as you could want giving you the sensation of being in a calm glass box on a busy street corner. The food is always exciting and the service always pleasant. Yesterday we were pleasantly surprised by the chicken pieces in chili sauce which was wonderful."}
{"text":"I am just visiting Toronto for the week, but was very happy that I decided to come here for lunch today.   I ended up ordering: 23. Wanton Soup (small) for $2.99 & 54. Spicy Fried Mock Chicken Nugget with Red Chili for $7.99.  Even the \"small\" for the Wanton Soup is actually fairly large, so this menu item is priced pretty cheap for how much soup you get. My soup had several wantons and several vegetables in it--all of which were tasty. And the broth was delicious too.   As far as the Spicy Fried Mock Chicken Nugget with Red Chili, this menu item was excellent. While it is served with a lot of red chili peppers, the fried mock chicken is actually not that spicy itself if you don't eat the peppers. The portion size is smaller (especially if you don't plan to consume all those red peppers), but this ended up being fine for me since I was traveling and would not be able to take home leftovers anyways.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food, big portions. Vegetables really take the starring role in their presentations, and everything is super-fresh. Service is okay for this part of town. Unassuming decor, but looks new and tables are spread out well. I will return of I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent selection and prompt service. Good value for money as portions are ample. We even had leftovers!  Worth a few more visits to sample more items on the menu. Hot and Sour Soup is particularly nice."}
