{"text":"Despite a downtown location, after years of dining and living in Madison I still had absolutely no concept of what the exterior looked like.  In fact Le Chardonnay is so easily overlooked while cruising down West Johnson that only recently did I learn it's general location or even that it existed.  Fortunately, Chardonnay was worth the find.  More fortunately visiting during the acclaimed restaurant week we got to sample nearly every option on the tasting menu and had a marvelous time overall.

Our appetizers consisted of onion soup, mussels, and ahi tuna salad.  The onion soup was good, full flavor, good for a starter.  Passing on the mussels, *shudder*, I was told they were quite good.  My salad had a nice sweet dressing, quality mixed greens, and the tuna was delish.  

The entrees were all good too, though we were slightly less enthusiastic about them than the appetizers and desserts.  Ravioli and chicken in a cream sauce were both very relaxing and clean tasting.  The chicken was very moist and delicate.  And all the dishes were plated very well (bonus points awarded!)

The desserts were amazing, and I am not a dessert guy.  Both the chocolate ganache and dark chocolate brownie were like \"sooo THIS is what the fuss about dessert is about!\"  

What topped the dessert though was something that I'd never experienced in a restaurant before.  It was somewhat late in the night, and perhaps it was because of the new customers from restaurant week, but the chef came out of the kitchen and did rounds around the tables asking us about our food.  Genuinely he wanted to know what we thought and tell us a little bit about the menu which is really more Mediterranean than French.  After the food portion he stayed and we talked about his emigration, watches and this and that, definitely a pleasant plus to have a little chat with the chef.  Finally, he gave us a shot of lemon liquor and we were on our way.

My experience at Le Chardonnay was probably a bit more elaborate than typical but based on first round I'd love to go again and have something off the full menu.  The place is intimate, romantic, and charming, (like the semi-exposed kitchen) a nice \"new\" place to discover.  And when it feels like there's the possibility of something special happening everything else is just that much better."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little something about Le Chardonnay: I have not stopped feeling warm and fuzzy about my experience there, and that was three days ago.  I wouldn't say that it's a \"hidden gem,\" because it's really in plain view on W. Johnson....but I just don't hear many people talk about it or how completely amazing it is.

It is a little plain jane from the outside, but the inside has warm wood accents, and is pretty and comfortable.  We had reservations at 6:30 on a Friday night (and I'd probably recommend you doing the same), and were seated right away.  We had a very jovial waiter who chatted us up about the weather, etc, but it didn't come off as awkward or like he was trying too hard.  It was natural and pleasant.

This is an appropriate time to mention: Le Chardonnay is the most well-oiled machine I've ever witnessed.  They had an unassuming bus boy milling about (but not in the way or imposing by any means), and as soon as you were done with a dish--bam!  It was gone!  Moments later, the waiter would reappear with your salad or entree or whatever.  He even dropped by once to refill my fiance's wine glass for him.  That's service. 

The food was fabulous, plain and simple.  A crusty french bread is served first with a nothing-short-of-miraculous spread consisting of garlic, carrots, and cumin.  It's buttery and delicious and you won't miss the real butter at all.  Your bread is then followed up by a mixed spring greens salad that isn't even mentioned in the menu (a very happy surprise to me, anyway).  We both got the Dieppoise, which is an assortment of seafood served over pappardelle pasta, smothered in a sinful saffron-cognac cream sauce.  I might not be able to pronounce \"Dieppoise,\" but I have developed a Pavlovian response to the way the word looks.  We followed dinner up with a piece of Tiramisu, which was only okay...but it didn't matter, because everything else was on a plane of existence where little cartoon birds are always fluttering overhead.  Also, I should mention that we got an excellent bottle of French Pinot Noir for $34.  None too shabby.

As I was leaving, the bus boy got my coat and PUT IT ON ME.  That was new.  And awesome."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  I was taken here for my birthday last February, and everything about it was 5-star quality.  The atmosphere is cozy and intimate - there was a guy playing acoustic guitar quietly which was a nice touch.  

We started with a bottle of Reisling which arrive chilled and in a bucket on ice... then tried the goat cheese appetizer witih mangoes... YUM.  I had stuffed peppers for my entree and they were amazing... tons of veggies, rice, and slivered almonds ensconced in yellow peppers, topped with melted parmesan.  

Finally, the waitress brought me a creme brulee for dessert with a candle in it - on the house!  I hate drawing attention at restaurants, but free dessert?  I'll take it!  

Also, very reasonable prices for top-quality French cuisine... I'd be back if I were still in Madison for sure."}
