{"text":"This is a poorly managed restaurant with no real seafood and definitely not fresh! &Poor service, it is not a suprise that their other locations have closed! Go to long john silvers its basically the same thing! Their slogan \"food with attitude\" is very fitting since their management is rude and unprofessional.  On 2 different occasions I  even heard staff complaining and yelling in their kitchen and not a happy environment.  & the owners didnt seem to do anything except walk around AND drink with customers while \"working\"."}
{"text":"Worst fish sandwich ever.  They say it is grouper,   I think Basa or Swai.  Staff and Management were notified.  Polite and professional.  Oh forgot to say the tartar sauce which was \" home made\" was sour tasting.  Yuck...I will pass on this place."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place and have been a regular there for a couple of years, but this spring things seem different. I don't know if there's new management or what, but the staff seems on edge and no one appears happy. The restaurant doesn't want to accommodate larger groups (like 7) and doesn't want to turn on the heaters on the patio when it's cold out. It's just a weird vibe, not fun and relaxing like before. Not sure I'll go back even though it's a great venue and the food is pretty good. Very sad!!!"}
{"text":"This place is gross and the food is poor quality. The kitchen chef \"rick\" is not professional around customers and has little skills unless you count microwaving frozen food a skill. save your money and go to long John Silvers. The food is the same quality as taco bell. The atmosphere looks like a \"ship wreck\" not an \"island retreat\". This place needs a lot of work!!"}
{"text":"Food is just above avg. Good summer hang out because of the patio. Bands are just avg. Jimmy buffet wanta bees.Staff is hired on youth and looks 5 to 7's typical under trained ding bats. Some do good job, most are representative of the me generation ie over inflated view of themselves. Do yourself a favor and head in to Chardon."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends, especially in the summer. They often have live music outdoors and an outdoor covered bar with lots of TV's to watch the ballgame. Great prices and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time, slow around 6p, started to pick up around 630. Hostess was fast, waitress was fast and very pleasant. I was not expecting much, reminds me of a dive or dump, but they lived up to way higher values inside. Everything was near perfect and we are brutal-picky. Drinks were higher end mixes, diverse menu, heavy seafood, but strong choices for all. Everything was cooked right and waitress constantly checked in on us, prices were average, no bargain and no rip off. We'll be back for sure, it fights hard against the Bistro, Patron's and the Brown Barn for quality and service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Cabana's island restaurant for dinner.  We sat outside on the patio.  We were promptly seated and ordered our cocktails while looking over the menu. My wife ordered Bubba's grilled shrimp with a baked potato and veggies. She also ordered a side salad which was not included with the meal.  The shrimp was a little spicy, but very tasty. The baked potato was done perfectly.  The vegetable medley was comprised of cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots and was prepared adequately, but not a spectacular preparation.  The salad was good. I ordered an appetizer of Cajun chicken wings for my dinner.  They were fantastic as always. ( I have eaten here several times before). They give you plenty of wings (10).  I took half of them home.  See the pictures I took of our dishes.   Cabana's is a nice local restaurant that I like to frequent when I am in that neighborhood.  The servers were really friendly and made our dinning experience memorable.  I would recommend them for a great casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE. Seafood is my favorite food so my boyfriend and I went on a date here once and oh my gosh we had such a good time! They have really yummy mixed drinks, the atmosphere was pleasant, the staff was polite and the decor was really pretty! I ordered scallops, they were great! I can't wait to go back but when the weather is nice so we can dine on the patio! Definitely one of the best restaurants I have been too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal on the patio.   The sweet potato waffle fries were as good as I've ever had.   The burger was cooked perfectly and massive.   My mind said keep eating but I was stuffed.    My wife had the fish tacos. Which she thoroughly enjoyed.   Wait staff was attentive.  They had live music starting up as we left.   We also noticed some cornhole boards off to the side.   My wife and I plan to return soon."}
{"text":"My brother and sister-in-law were visiting and wanted to take us out to dinner They winter in Belize and and I, not wanting to choose something too high end, thought they would enjoy this  moderately priced Island themed restaurant. My husband works nearby and often has decent lunch is there, and I've had decent meals there. My brother ordered the jerk chicken and it arrived smothered in barbecue sauce. The waitress did not come back for a food check so we flagged her down and he pointed out to her what he thought was a kitchen error. She informed him that was jerk sauce. We all told her that it was barbecue sauce. She brought the menu back and sure enough it was described as being smothered in a honey mustard mustard BBQ sauce, and odd take on jerk chicken. My brother had not read the fine print and proceeded to scrape the sauce of the chicken to eat it. I asked the waitress to please bring him another choice she said she would check with the manager. She returned and asked what he would like. My sister-in-law was enjoying her shrimp dish, had garlic and lime or something like that, and he ordered that. 40 minutes later they brought out his shrimp. it looked nothing like the dish my sister-in-law was eating. The cook, I  won't call him a chef, had dumped what looked like a whole jar of jerk seasoning on his shrimp. Again we called the server over, a cute young girl who seemed afraid to try to make things right, Even though she agreed that it was not the same dish. I asked her to let the cook know that we were hip to his passive aggressive bull crap, and we left it at that with my brother trying to scrape off the pile of seasoning,but I suggested he not eat it. If a kitchen staff would do that who knows what else they would do to your dish. I will never return here neither will my husband. And if you do eat here don't try to send anything back to the kitchen. Rick the cook is a jerk who doesn't know jerk about chicken but enjoys jerking customers around."}
{"text":"Came here in the middle of winter. Literally a snow storm swirling around us. This place gets rave reviews for being an summer/outdoor/patio/live music hot spot, but it really needs to be praised for more than that.    The food menu was extensive, in a good a way. I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, and me being a huge foodie is a huge plus, when I can't make up my mind because everything sounds great, you know have a good thing going on. I ultimately decided on the lobster Mac and cheese. It was $15 dollars(which I thought at first was outrageous for Mac and cheese), but worth every single dime. It came with a side salad. First bonus. But then the actual dish came out. OMG. HUGE portions! I was honestly expecting a tiny soup cup bowl full of Mac and cheese. What I got was a larger than life, entree sized, savory, cheesy, baked lobster Mac and cheese. They didn't skip on the lobster meat either, every bite had the right amount of lobster, baked bread crumbs, cheesy blend, and pasta. I was truly impressed. Add to the delicious food, it happens to be $2.25 margrita night.... One of my favorite drinks.  I honestly drove right past this place and thought it wouldn't be to my standards. After realizing nothing else was around I decided to stay and eat. It blew past my expectations and I can't wait to return when summer is in full swing and the patio is popping. Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"I have randomly found this place for work. Then found out they have awesome bartender Melissa I have had three meals here chicken sandwich which was amazing , diablo burger wow hot and good and fish. 3 for 3 good food."}
{"text":"hey there!  I recognized Cabana's as a place I used to work at when I was in high school (Skeeter's 19th hole).  They have a HUGE patio with live music.  But if you want to go on the patio you can't get there from in the restaurant.   It has it's own entrance and restrooms.  No worries though.  Wife and I had a house salad and wings...so not a full dinner review.  However salad was fresh, not over loaded with any one ingredient, a nice mix of romaine and iceberg.  Wings were big and hot!  Nothing left on my plate.  Our server was the bartender, not only easy on the eyes but knew her drinks.  I had some sort of fruity rum something or other.  Whatever it was I had three of them.  It was super cold however and we ended up our evening inside.    Wife and I will definitely make this a goto place again!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat there but had a super fun sunny day on the patio, and played some corn hole for giggles."}
{"text":"Ok so this place seems a little sketchy from the road, and doesn't help it's vibe once you sit at the bar. Every employee seemed pissed about something and really didn't want to be there.  But we were thirsty and the menu looked promising so we decided to stay and give it a try.  Kinda glad we did. Despite the gloomy attitudes,  our bartenders were attentive and made some pretty serious cocktails.  We were in the mood for seafood and started with lobster quesadilla.  Wish I would have read the previous reviews cuz there was definitely fake lobster (pollack) in it. Even so, it was really tasty and well prepared. I had my doubts when the grouper main course arrived, but the result was the same as the previous dish. Pretty sure it wasn't the real thing, but it was well  prepared and very tasty. Since we were paying happy hour prices for drinks, and the food was tasty, we will probably be back. The burgers looked awesome. But they should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass off authentic Lobster and grouper. Still a fun place, though"}
{"text":"Deplorable service and they let people smoke (even though it's supposed to be illegal in Ohio) so you have to gag on smoke the whole time you're trying to choke down your hard-as-shoe leather chicken sandwich. Pass."}
{"text":"Wish you were here!  The patio is a great place to stop in and grab a bite while listening to a good band.  They also have boccie courts if the mood to get competitive strikes you.  The menu has some standard fare but there a quite a few items that are similar base meals but prepared differently.  It's a nice change."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here ALL THE TIME! The food is great and we especially like all the different specialty cocktails and shooters they have to choose from, which are delicious and pretty inexpensive compared to most other restaurants. Their baked mac & cheese is the best I've ever had, definitely my thing on the menu. I've tried lots of different menu items: salads, burgers, wraps, pastas and have never had any issues. The staff is very polite and does their job well. And I especially love when their patio is open during the summer, great atmosphere! This is my go to place."}
{"text":"Took the family here for dinner tonight for the first time. We all got something different and it was all delicious. Prices were very reasonable too.  I got Seafood Rockefeller, husband got AYCE fish (Thursday special), 2 kids got different burgers (which were huge), and son in law got Bubba Gump Shrimp.  Server was prompt with refills and everything else.  We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"So I got this raspberry bomb, and let me tell you, it was so good, it brought me back to my childhood when my mom used to add alcohol to my Kool Aid to try to get me to go to sleep. I also got to listen to Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\" all the way through, which never happens at other establishments. Long story short, all of my dreams came true in the span of 15 minutes. I can die alone and happy now."}
{"text":"The menu is a good variety of seafood and non seafood entrees. There are also a lot of dishes that are pretty spicy, which I love. They even have some low cal healthy selections and always interesting specials.  Service is friendly and fast. It can be a bit loud when it's full."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere of any restraunt I've been too great tropical feel good food lots of seafood options"}
{"text":"Pretty decent seafood, burgers, etc. Kinda like the food they serve at Islands, only not quite as good. Also its a bar so yeah party on."}
