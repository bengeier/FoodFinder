{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a drink and a great meal largely because you can't bet the beautiful and relaxing atmosphere! You can sit right next to the golf course while watching the sun set over the mountains and service is always fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what they're trying to go for here, but it's not Italian. It's more like bland bar food. The service was ok (the hostesses seemed a bit immature). The view is very nice, so I'd probably go back for a cocktail and the view."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and were seated outside on the patio which had a great view of the greenbelt at Grayhawk. The salad was very good was Quinoa with Shrimp  could have had a few more shrimp however it was very good.The server was nice but was a little slow in getting to us."}
{"text":"Known for the \"best patio and worst service.\" Since, establishment has opened, they continue to honor the tag line above You are welcomed by eye rolling hostesses, that clearly need basic training for the lack of people skills. Waited over an hour for a reservation at 7pm, so don't bother making one. The food was alright but nothing was memorable.  LB"}
{"text":"Claudia and her team delivered a wonderful dining experience only matched by the views."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the main attraction is the outdoor seating. It is on a golf course with beautiful views. The menu is not very appealing but whatever I finally settle on I always end up liking well enough. Still, before deciding to go we always wonder what will we actually be able to order? But then we go because of the patio and view.   Our servers have always been friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Three hostesses just standing around ... we picked a table and seated ourselves.  Waited 10 minutes for a waiter and another 10 minutes before the drinks arrived, and they were wrong;  a beer and a glass a wine.    From this point on  the waiter took the persona of Eddie Haskell; he apologized for everything but got nothing right.  Our meal took over an hour; a cheese pizza and a meatball sandwich.     The wait was not worth it.  The pizza was salty and laced with garlic.  The meatballs were tough and overcooked.    We had to seek out the waiter to pay our bill.  We did not complain about the service or the food.....we will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm throwing down four stars because I couldn't complain about NUTHIN. The group we were with had a bundle of kids with them running around all crazy. So I was surprised at the service we got with such madness going on.   I like the choice of cocktails they have, I had a sample of the honey martini and the blueberry moonshine are both quite tasty.  We split a pizza and it was good, had lots of greens on it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!  Decent food but service was beyond horrible.  Too bad. Beautiful location but the total disregard for their customers ruin our experience. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The ambience is the bulk of it and the food is ok. The staff (bartenders) were great and very attentive.  The food always seems to be average. Tonight , I tried the tacos and they were less than mediocre. The steak was like leather and we gave it 2 tries. YUK! They took it off of our bill which was the right thing to do."}
{"text":"The food was delicious although my pasta was rather under cooked. The starters were superb, fresh and had a tasty range if flavours combinations.  We were a large party with two 3 year olds who were able to run on the lawn and play. This made the evening an enjoyable experience and the server, Chris was greAt. He kept the drinks flowing and the only negative would be that the meal was rather long in coming. It would have helped if the children's food had been delivered much earlier as they were really hungry by the time to food arrived.  All in all a positive and enjoyable evening in a wonderful setting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for a romantic dinner. The cocktails are wonderful, the service is excellent, and the food is spot on. Try the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have had a great time both times! It is awesome for a dinner date and I loved the food. A little pricey, but so is everything in Scottsdale. Its kinda hidden and small which makes parking tough. But make a reservation and have a nice meal and a drink on a beautiful golf course."}
{"text":"Uggh obviously the new hip place in North Scottsdale...but the staff is rude and lie to you. We called ahead and told them we were on our way with a party of 8. I know it is a large party but I wanted them to be prepared. The girl who answered the phone said it would be an hour but come on in. When we got there they were packed. People everywhere, probably 50 people standing around waiting for a table. I thought uh oh this doesn't look good but she assured us that there were several big parties about to leave and it would still be an hour. So we stayed. We kept checking with the front staff and they kept saying the next big table to leave would be ours. Hour and fifteen minutes later a big table of 8 got up to leave and the waiters  separated the tables into two tables of four. Hostess totally lied to us and wasted over 2 hours of our night with drive time. Totally embarrassing as we were with another family from out of town. Clearly they don't care about their customers or lying to people to their faces. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"It's funny to read the negative reviews from parents on the \"security guard\" because that's the reason why I'd like to give them 6 stars vs 5.  Isabella's should be commended for trying to hold parents accountable to monitor their children better, because these entitled snobs make eating out unbearable for the rest of us. There is nothing worse then going to a restaurant where parents let their children roam around like it's their backyard or a playground with no regard for other restaurant patrons.  If that's what these people want then they are better suited to eat at McDonald's.  The fact that they think they should just be allowed to do what they want because there is grass on site is proof of why Scottsdale is known as \"Snobsdale\".  Get over yourselves people, this is a RESTAURANT.   If you don't want to discipline your children to sit and behave in a restaurant, then stay at home or get a babysitter.  I've seen drinks knocked over and glasses broken too many times, so good for you Isabella's for doing something about this for the rest of your customers! THANK YOU!   On to other important items.  The food and the service are always tremendous.  The pizzas and salads are always spot on, salt and pepper shrimp app is amazing and while it's an Italian restaurant, don't overlook that burger.  It's fantastic!  I've never had any complaints.  Great wine list as well."}
{"text":"The mushroom pizza and the butcher pizza are fabulous!. The people watching on Friday nights is the best. The patio view are impressive."}
{"text":"While I found the service to always be good here as it was my last visit the food took a big downturn.  We always liked the pizza - great thin flaky crust with a good mixture of toppings. We were very disappointed in the \"new style\" of pizza they are serving. The crust tasted machine made. hard and thick and with not much taste.  They also put way too much sauce on the crust (maybe to mask the bad crust?) As far as toppings.....wait, where are they?  We discovered only about 3 quarter sized pepperoni per slice of pizza.  Unfortunately, they have gone from one of the better places for pizza in Scottsdale, to one not deserving to go to. Even the Cesar salad was not as good as it used to be- the dressing tasted like it came from a bottle.  After all this, we suspected the chef had left.  Sure enough,  the waitress confirmed; he left one month ago."}
{"text":"The female bartender came off like we were bothering her. Not friendly at all. Our waitress was ok but again, not friendly. Food was good."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow is all I can say. This place is amazing!! From the food to the service to the atmosphere.  This place will knock your socks off!!! Highly recommend!  5 stars."}
{"text":"The owner personally  informed our group that he would \"prefer kids not be here.\" The food is mediocre at best and very overpriced. With so many great restaurants within a half mile radius of this place I would STEER CLEAR of this one at all COSTS!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit here. Our first visit went okay, the service was mediocre but we did find the pizza to be good so that led is to come back a second time. The second visit was an entirely different story.  First it took about 20 mins before we had a server to even put a drink order in. That server advised us she was there to get drinks and would sort out who our server was. This after we had to advise another server that we hadn't received any service.  Our drinks showed up promptly along with our apologetic server. We put our order in and it took about 30 mins to get the food. Our server did check back with us shortly after that but then we didn't see her again for about 30 mins. I ordered the Hamwich and it would've been pretty good if it was served warm & toasted but it came out like any other cold cut sandwich and that was very disappointing.  Meanwhile the pizza we ordered showed up after the other items and it was not our pizza. After this a manager came to visit us and apologized for all that had gone wrong, he did buy our drinks and offer us their friends and family discount along with another pizza made to order to take home. While in the end they made things right we won't be back to this place due to the inconsistency. Such a shame because the building itself is fabulous and has the potential  to be a really great place."}
{"text":"If you like a $17 vodka martini (that's right, no typo!), doughy and tasteless pizza, and small main course portions of average-tasting pasta, then this is the place for you! Another reviewer was disappointed in the bread, but we were not since we never received any. Isabella's is a very attractive restaurant, but it is kind of like a date with eye candy - a georgeous person but lacking in the brains department."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Portions very small.  Visited Saturday night and again on Sunday and their computers were down both days.  Ordered a salad with chicken expecting the chicken to be hot, instead it was ice cold.  Reminded me of a cold salad you buy at the airport to take on the plane.  Awful!  I asked when the menu was going to be revamped as it needs considerable help."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. Food was delivered swift which initially I thought was great. However, it proved to be under prepared and hardly mediocre.  I will give it one more try."}
{"text":"As a local resident, we love heading over for a glass of wine and the amazing sunset views. At times it gets a little hectic with all of the local kiddos running around the grassy area, but as a mom it's a nice way for families to enjoy dinner and drinks in our own neighborhood. Matt and the other servers are always  welcoming faces.....Food is ok, but we really haven't had more than appetizers..... We will be back....!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Good place to grab a drink and enjoy the view however, food is average at best. Had their appetizers and pizza previously and they are certainly nothing special.  Don't get the beer in mason jars but whatever. Will still patronize for a drink but avoid the food unless really famished."}
{"text":"I'm struggling here because I really really want to love this place. It's a beautiful location, just down the street from my house and the atmosphere and views are great. Problem is, I just don't think the food is much to write home about. The jokes on me though, because I keep going back in my quest to fall in love.    I've had the pizza and also a salad, both were ok. The drinks are good, albeit a bit pricey but par for the course (pun intended, you'll get it if you've been) for North Scottsdale dining. The outdoor area is good for kids, so that does give them a little bump up in my book.     I would recommend Isabella's for lovely drinks on the patio on a comfortable Arizona evening, but I would plan on Dinner elsewhere. No doubt I'll try it again like a mediocre relationship that should work but just doesn't."}
{"text":"This Italian eatery is absolutely charming, warm & welcoming.     The ambiance is so unique and the food was outstanding!!!     A fun place to hang inside or outside.     We are going to bring our friends back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff is friendly and helpful. It can be very busy on some weekends and holidays so plan. They do take same day reservations which is nice. We frequent here a few times a year. Also enjoyed July 4th with the view of the valley during all the fireworks!"}
{"text":"We came here for my dearest friend's 50th  birthday. We were traveling from the Bay Area and Isabella's came recommended. Unfortunately the General Manager was so rude to us that we left before finishing an appetizer. View great, food so-so, our server was lovely, but with this management I can not recommend. There are plenty of better places in Scottsdale that will treat you with respect."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the things I enjoyed here. We came in for lunch at around 11:30am and sat outside in the back. The pretty and fun furnishings complement a beautifully green and well-maintained golf course. For our appetizer, we chose the artichoke dip. It's different from the typical dip seen at other restaurants, but its unique flavor was really tasty.  Now for some of things I didn't enjoy as much. As other people have said, the wait is abnormally long. I'm sure there are reasons (maybe the food is made from scratch each time), but it took 20+ min for our appetizer to come out. Also, when that came out, we had to remind our waiter to take our order. He was very nice about it and did try to explain the wait *As a side note, there were, at most, 10 other customers here. Afterward, we waited about 30 min for our main meal. I ordered the lasagna and for the price of $17, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. The fish sandwiches were alright as well. The ones we had tasted a little too fishy for our preference. The final item we had was the Islander pizza. It was like a Hawaiian pizza, but definitely with a nice flavor upgrade.   Tl;dr Pros and cons from our experience: View and ambiance is really nice Servers were friendly Food was either a solid hit or miss (depending on your expectations) Wait time for food was LONG even for lunchtime and the lack of customers"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang with friends. Awesome golf course and city views. Food is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The best thing about Isabella's by far is the beautiful atmosphere as there is plenty of outdoor seating facing out into the gorgeous golf course. We were able to sit on one of the couches on the patio with a fire pit - highly recommend!   Our server was super-friendly and was extremely accommodating to my gluten-free diet. While they do not have a separate gluten-free menu, he went back and verified with the chef what substitutions they could make to get me a GF meal. I was able to enjoy the Green Beans as an appetizer and the Kale salad.  The green beans were AMAZING - and the kale salad was really tasty and fresh as well with grapefruit and orange, roasted almonds and vinaigrette. They were able to add some grilled chicken to give it more substance too. The salad portion was HUGE - I kept eating it for over an hour and yet still barely made a dent.  They have a rooftop which looks pretty neat - would love to return here at night & see the stars & Phoenix lights."}
{"text":"Bummer service. Handed the menu, 2 minutes later asked \"what are you having\" told the guy I'm not decided on anything. That was 15 minutes ago. When I sat down he didn't even offer to clean the bar top. He did it for the other couple sitting next to me. I even used my sleeve to clean it off myself."}
{"text":"Went there with another couple and was quite frankly embarrassed by how bad this place is. Lousy food and service. They brought out bread with no plates. They served me terrible tomato soup and forgot to bring a spoon.  Nice location, stylish bar. Just don't go there for the food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Isabella's twice - once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both have been horrible.    The Service: On our first visit, the service was fine.  On our second, however, the service was downright strange.  Our waitress threatened, jokingly(?), to punch one of us in the face if we dropped our napkin again.  She subsequently stated that she \"spit on the fish\" when she served it to one of the members of our party, but quickly stated she was joking.  In addition to the above, she insisted on calling my wife \"girl\" as if they were lifelong friends (they weren't).  The Food: In a word - HORRIBLE.  On my first visit, we went for lunch and I ordered a tuna sandwich.  The waitress indicated that it was \"Italian style\" brown tuna.  I've had tuna like that before and was looking forward to it.  Boy was I disappointed.  The tuna was under-seasonsed, overly salted, and down right disgusting.  It wasn't suitable for animal, let alone human consumption.  I would not have returned based on the tuna alone, but was convinced by my wife to give it a second chance for dinner.  Big mistake.  For dinner I ordered the lasagna, but  it was horrendous.  The \"chef\" had taken an under-seasoned tomato meat sauce and thrown it in between several over-cooked lasagna noodles.  The tasteless \"meat\" in the meat sauce was over-cooked as well, included a piece of gristle (or worse) in each bite.  Desert was equally disappointing.  In summary - do not eat at this restaurant.  Ever.  You will regret it."}
{"text":"Isabellas has become our Mothers Day tradition. My wife had the fish which was fabulous, my mother had the white veggie lasagna, and I had the egg sandwich. Lasagna was a very generous portion and the fish was baked inside parchment paper which kept in the flavors and kept it moist and tender."}
{"text":"Grilled artichokes, Ribeye with blue cheese and shitake mushrooms..delicious. I sat outside in the heat by choice. The food was delicious and the service was great. The only odd thing was that by the bar there was a kids bar with 2 little bar stools. I don't drink so it seemed odd that adults would want their kids to be at the bar with them."}
{"text":"Fifth time there, and can say that they are getting much better.  Perfect setting and views of the golf course, and attentive and friendly servers.  Actually was there twice this week, once for dinner and once for lunch.  Pizza has changed since their opening, and now it is pretty incredible.  Both experiences this week were excellent, and awesome place for casual dinner with pasta, pizza and wine.  Will be back, and while not much was really wrong before, for some reason everything just seemed better."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite.  Sat at the bar and received great service and very good food.   Enjoyed the roasted Brussels sprouts salad and a magherita pizza.   Would recommend both.  The mix of flavors and textures in the salad was very memorable.   How can anything with bacon, cranberries and maple be bad.   The tartness of the pomegranate Margarita was perfect."}
{"text":"stopped there today for lunch. I ordered the spinach salad with grilled chicken and my husband ordered the shrimp in white wine sauce pasta.  My husbands pasta was OK $18 and nothing to come back for.  My salad was horrible.  It was supposed to have a buttermilk dressing, the \"dressing\" tasted like plain oil (yuck) the bacon was hard enough to break a tooth but at least added some taste to the dish. The chicken was dried up and tasted like it had sat around for a week (yuck). No bread ever offered and the iced tea was small and they were stingy on refills, brought ice instead.  We definitely will not return ($50 with tip and a total waste of calories), so many better places to eat!"}
{"text":"The staff was great!  They had a nice variety cocktails  and  the food was good.    Enjoyed the indoor outdoor experience. Will be back to experience the sunset."}
{"text":"Dear Isabella,  Your restaurant is beautiful. Your bar is magnificent. The views across the desert golf course landscape are incredible. I could sit there all day.  But...  Why would you choose to staff your hostess area with a crew of poorly trained, unfriendly and seemingly uncaring people? Isn't that like the first rule of any customer service oriented business? Create a warm and welcoming first impression? Our rather bored hostess walked us to a table only after we asked nicely after perusing the menu (obviously, we were new to the restaurant). Perhaps my non-designer jeans and clunky Croc flip-flops were distasteful to her but I could have been a millionaire for all she knew. Don't all patrons deserve a smile and a friendly welcome? Even those with a serious style deficit?   I enjoyed your Cool Collins cocktail but for $9.50 on a Friday evening at 5 p.m. (ever heard of happy hour?), I expected more. The pizza ... meh.  I wish you well Isabella. I wanted to like you."}
{"text":"Boy this is really sad to see Isabella's at 2.5 stars. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt at 3 stars. Tons of potential here for someone to take this place over. The current menu is mediocre with limited options. The calamari was disgusting but the prosciutto pizza was decent. We will only be back for drinks and perhaps a pizza. Bummer."}
{"text":"Great place with fantastic patio. Kyle is an excellent waiter who helped us via the chef develop a great white sauce pasta meal with veggies without any pepper, seasoning or any other peppers due to my pepper allergy. We will return. Thank you Kyle and Chef."}
{"text":"Recently spent an evening with my wife & some friends at Isabella's Kitchen in Scottsdale's Grayhawk area. I'd never been before & Google mapped it before we went. It told us it was in Grayhawk's clubhouse - not so - It's directly across the street! Once we got there we sat outside on the expansive patio. They've got a view-deck too! The food was amazing, the pours were generous and we didn't want to leave. Next time we'll bring the kids, because they can actually run around outside!"}
{"text":"Isabella's environment, staff and management is FANTASTIC!! Gabby and Ashley took such great care of our group! They went above and beyond! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Isabella's Kitchen gets 5 stars for atmosphere . . . Just love this place based on our first lunch there. The building sits right on the Grayhawk golf course with expansive views of the mountains, and at night, they say you can see the lights of the city. There are plenty of places to hang your hat even if you're not dining at one of the indoor tables -- there are large outdoor couches, rocking chairs, fire pit like seating, outdoor tables, and lights strung from the building. Isabella's is surely going to be a very popular hangout as well as dining spot throughout the year.   Our server Christopher was so attentive . . . and he was very sincere about making sure that everything was to our liking. He was very knowledgeable for the place having just opened only a few days ago, and when he didn't have the answers to questions like \"is your patio dog friendly?\" he went to ask his manager. By the way, it is unfortunately not dog friendly, but I get it, since it abuts the golf course.   They had many available options on their limited opening menu, more than than some restaurants have on their regular menu . . . but, the regular menu starts tomorrow (October 15th) so no worries. Honestly, having seen the full menu, I probably would have picked the options we had anyway. The mac and cheese is dreamy. The noodles are almost the consistency of gnocchi and very tasty with the accompanying small cubed ham, creamy cheese and crispy bread crumbs. This was one of the best mac and cheese dishes I have had in a long time . . . It was the perfect size to share. If not for the calories, I could have had this as my main course and been full, fat and happy.  Hubby had the meatball sandwich which was a nice size for lunch. I had the eggplant Parmesan sandwich which came on foccacia bread. The layered eggplant was tasty but it could have been a tad bit warmer and had a little more sauce and cheese. Both sandwiches came with a choice of house salad or potatoes, and we both opted for the potatoes. They were just amazingly delicious . . . like a deep fried potato chip . . . very crispy on the outside with the real potato texture inside. Delicious!  We will definitely be back to check out some of the other items that we saw other diners enjoying, like the bruschetta, pizza, and pasta. This is a fun place with a big personality. Mangia! Mangia! Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Terrible, visited twice this week as first nite we had visitors and loved concept of view & location Staff were rude, bartender was actually eating dinner behind bar and ignored us until he was finished, mediocre food tainted by crappy service  My boss asked me to join some clients two nites later,  same type of experience with us actually leaving and going to sports bar at market street as we wouldn't get a staff member to take our order  Not returning, bring back the golf school"}
{"text":"Chuck E Cheese meets Bad Service!  I'll never go back!  Booked table for 8, 3 weeks in advance.  Came in & re confirmed IN PERSON day of reservation.  Arrive and 3 snotty little teenagers, aka, hostesses, tell me to wait in the bar, the table will be ready in 20 minutes.  What?!   I had been told we would have a quiet table on the edge of the patio.  Right!  We're put next to a kids birthday party with parents who send their precious little darlings out to run all over the place so they can enjoy their evening.  Really?!  Never saw a manager so there was no one to share my frustration with.  Food was on par with Applebee's.  Nothing special.   So, if you want a poorly run place with mediocre food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went to Isabekka's tonight. Got poor service and excuse of \"communication error\" as to who was our server. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"Bad service, had to ask three times for coffee refill. The waiter never came to our table, the bus boy was a better service provider."}
{"text":"Receptionist always act snooty in person and over the phone.  I live 5 min away from this place and as much as I love the food and ambiance I avoid it due to the staff.  Terrible.  I've tried in the past to talk to the managers and left a message.  They never called me back.   The one star is for the staff not the food or ambience."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Isabella's Kitchen and definitely not my last! I absolutely loved everything about it. From the friendly and attentive service to the beautiful outdoor seating view, this restaurant exceeded my expectations.    Our server was knowledgable about the menu and patient as I switched out some ingredients for others in the Picado salad. I dined with a group of 5 others ladies who also enjoyed their dishes of pizza, sandwiches, and pasta. The weather was perfect and the environment is relaxing and enjoyable. If you are looking for a personable restaurant with a unique flair and delicious food, you have found it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, romantic and the food and service was great! (Despite the mosquitos!) The roof has an amazing view."}
{"text":"Isabella's staff and service will always exceed my expectations. I make an effort to come to this establishment every time I come back home to Arizona.   today, I started out with hummus and pita bread which was presented with excellence and accompanied by fresh cooked vegetables. my main entree was \"Izzy's Burger\"... I never thought a burger can taste so good after having this masterpiece, aka 'merica. to end the night, I had a fresh warm brownie with vanilla ice cream. just AMAZING.   the atmosphere was very pleasing. my party sat outside as the sun was setting and it was beautiful seeing it set while eating, especially right next to the golf course. I would recommended this place to anyone I know.   kudos to the cooks making the amazing food, 5 freaking stars.."}
{"text":"Nice place for Happy Hour!  We sat on the patio courtyard with comfy rocking chairs.  The view of the golf course with the mountains as a backdrop at sunset was spectacular! Especially if you're a golfer;)  We had the Bruschetta Trio which was huge and yummy! The only odd thing was the flies that bombarded our table at Sunset...we felt uneasy!  Then the flies disappeared once it got dark.  Hope this place gets a bug zapper or something!"}
{"text":"The patio or the outside portion of the bar is the place to hang at Isabella's Kitchen. ( Though it seems there's a \"rooftop\" section overlooking the golf course also ). It's spacious, with a great view of the mountains in the distance off the golf course. There are several lounge areas with fire pits you can chill out at with your friends as you sip a glass of wine ( but avoid the Happy Hour Cabernet, very bland and flat with no personality ). We each opted for a personal pizza, of which there are about 10 choices. I had the Classic Margherita, which I found to be really flavorful and just enough to satisfy.   The ambiance, if you're with friends, is just great. The crowd seems a bit pretentious: privileged golf folk lounging around chatting about the round they just played, sweaters tied around the neck but you can chill out, enjoy great company, a view, people watch and have some good food.  The staff was friendly; Alonzo was really engaging, personable and funny. We were checked up on often without it ever being overbearing. He made our time there fun.   Isabella's Kitchen is a nice destination for an afternoon or evening nosh and drink. Good destination for a fall, open air gathering."}
{"text":"Nothing is clean. Roof is a disgrace with sticky cheese, and crap stuck to everything. Nothing more than a cheap pick up joint. Too bad. My husband built this place.... It was once a classy place to come..."}
{"text":"Isabella's Kitchen has the potential to become an outstanding North Scottsdale restaurant.  I was there this evening and thought the atmosphere was superb, the wine was reasonably priced as were the drinks of friends.  The food was very good, although the theme around the table was that the sauces were good, there wasn't a kick to any of them.  I had the pork and fettuccine, vegetable lasagna, meat lasagna and fettuccine with clams were the other dinners at our table.  Everyone agreed the portions sizes were perfect, but the lack of \"superior\" taste in all the dishes was lacking.  I kept stirring my dish expecting to get a taste of something special although the meat was tender and noodles were cooked perfectly.  The service was very good but bread was not delivered until our entrees were served and we had to ask for it.  It was tasty and served with oil, but no plates were offered for the bread so we didn't have a place for the oil to be dipped.  All in all, I think Isabella's will be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood, only being open a week I hope they work out some kinks."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! So nice on the golf course and its so cute in decor. The food is yummy- i had pizza, salad, and bites of pasta and all bomb. Must go!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Super family/kid friendly.  All of the staff were very friendly and outgoing.  Enjoyed the open layout, even indoor seating has an outdoor feel.  I had calamari and the islander pizza, both were very good.  My wife had brussel sprouts and spaghetti and meatballs.  You could tell everything was made from scratch.  Pasta was terrific!  We will be back."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this three stars instead of two is because my kids love to run around here. And they have some decent wines. But the service is subpar, and most of the food is outright atrocious. Stick with the pizzas if you want to stay safe. I ordered the shrimp ceviche, and I'm not kidding it came out as a mass of brown goo. I questioned the waitress, and she said that was the avocado in it. (Which obviously means this thing has been sitting around for a day or two.) I could not find the shrimp. and I could not even figure out what else was in it ! I sent it back and got the hummus platter. The hummus was a blob of garlic with an oily pool on top of it with white-bread pita. I have eaten all kinds of hummus over the years, and I could not eat this. We ended up feeding the Wonderbread pita to the ducks. I dread coming back here except only when my kids beg me to, it's too bad because the location and view are absolutely phenomenal. Maybe you should just come for a drink."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fantastic setting in North Scottsdale for brunch, lunch or dinner, then Isabella's is the place.  Casual, comfortable and a outdoor visual setting next to none as the ambiance of the Greyhawk Golf course sets it off.   Most importantly, their gluten free pizza crust is off the off the hook!!!...   Thin crust with ultra fresh toppings made to order.   Ain't no better place.   Ask for Alexandra....."}
{"text":"I go often to Isabella's as they are in the neighborhood and offer some of the best outdoor spaces up in North Scottsdale. But last night left a bad taste in my mouth about the place.   1. The food is just terrible. My friend and I ordered the bruschetta and the bread was stale. Like they have been using days old bread that should be used in meatballs instead. And the toppings were just blah. (It's not difficult to make)  2. The bartenders were beyond lazy. I had a women sitting at the bar come over to tell us that it was last call and then she delivered our check. She claimed she worked there and she was off duty, but i found this to be unacceptable. The bar was not busy and it was just terrible service. It angered me as i was not going to leave a tip, as i kept having to go to bar to ask for drinks and the order of bruschetta was forgotten and the bus boy had to ask about our order.   Again, I do enjoy the place, but there are other places that do so much of a better job. Hope they can get there act together."}
{"text":"Went last night (Sat) for first time with another couple....we were a tad skeptical after some pretty harsh yelp reviews.  It was FANTASTIC!!!  Gorgeous views from our patio table, live music, delicious apps (bruschetta and salt/pepper shrimp), islander pizza (pineapple, jalapeño, and prosciutto) and kale salad ROCK, and service was excellent too (thank you Jessica)!!!  The wine list is expansive enough, and I love the glass and a half option...yum!!!  Will definitely return again soon (it is kid-friendly too....might even bring our girls next time)!!!"}
{"text":"This place suffers from an identity crisis.  Good menu that you want to be served in a quiet environment but isn't. It's a loud almost sports bar environment. Isabella's has several things going for it and at the top of the list is the back patio. Went prepared for bad service and at first that was dead on. Hostess could have carried less where we wanted to sit or if we even stayed. A nice young guy came by our table and my husband asked to moved. he was more than happy to help. When we finally got seated at a table outside in the bar we had two servers try to help us. The food was decent. The menu has mostly heavy Italian food which is hard to eat in the Arizona heat. We would go back because it's close to the hotel we frequent and the patio is lovely. Next time a salad and pizza will do."}
{"text":"An absolute gem!! We have had dinner here every week for the past month. Isabella's is great for a quick drink, lunch or dinner. I imagine it would also be an awesome place to host an event. The patio is one of the best in town. It overlooks the golf course, super comfy vibe, great couches with a fireplace and a huge fenced in grassy area (phenomenal for kids - they can run around and watch the ducks).  Every server we have had so far has been so friendly and attentive, I wasn't a fan of the gluten-free pizza I had a few days ago, but oh well, there are tons of other great menu options. They also have a nice variety of beers and wines. I think you can make a reservation which I would highly recommend as it fills up pretty quickly, especially the patio this time of year. Or you can be like us old souls and eat dinner at 4:30.  It's a little pricey, but the pros FAR outweigh this. This is completely unrelated to the restaurant and out of their control, just a little PSA from me....if you go (which I highly recommend you do!) please don't feed the ducks. Last weekend, we saw 1 group feed them chips and guacamole and another person feed them pizza crust. Poor ducks :("}
{"text":"It gets three stars for the atmosphere - lovely patio seating with fireplace, view of the city lights and the service.  We had an excellent server - Alonzo - he was friendly - helpful - fun - efficient - and knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was just mediocre to me - nothing special. The pudding dessert with praline was the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. The service is often not very good. Today it was 25 minutes until we got even the drinks.  The food is over-priced and only okay. But, the atmosphere carries it."}
{"text":"O.k. how have I lived here for 4 years and not been here?? I LOVED the atmosphere, music, service,  VIEWS, menu, and of course the food! The Brussels were to die for and the salad was full of flavor!  Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Service was outstanding. Server was prompt, directed us through our  drink order, made some great dinner suggestions. Had the Margarhita Pizza, Peasant Pasta.... Perfect with the cold draft beer served in cool mason jars. Fantastic setting in the desert on a full moon night! Golfing there tomorrow! Maybe ill grab lunch!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Isabella's since it opened a few years ago. We have always had great food, great service, and a great time. Our experience last night prompted me to finally write a review.  We typically order a delicious pizza to go, after we enjoy a cocktail and enthusiastic conversation with the best bartender, Jim, aka Petey, and best manager, Nate. Last night's experience did not disappoint. Between the lively banter and laughter, they are also focused on making sure each person at the bar or in the restaurant has a fresh cocktail and attentive service.  Last night, we decided to change things up and eat at the bar.   My husband ordered Spaghetti & Meatballs, while I had Deb's Pasta. The handcut pastas were amazing. The texture was perfect, and the sauces did not take away from the freshness of the pasta. You could taste all the fresh herbs in the roasted tomato sauce, and the meatballs were savory with just the right amount of spice. With Deb's Pasta, the melted Parmesan and tomatoes were the perfect compliment to the grilled chicken and spaghetti.  I cannot say enough about the fantastic meal and fabulous experience. You will never be disappointed at Isabella's."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! I thought I would never taste a Domino's Pasta Bread Bowl or Pizza Hut frozen pasta dish, but I did today and I didn't even realize it until it arrived at the table. Isabella's is nothing short of a great location and atmosphere joint with HORRIBLE food. The supposedly fresh made pasta tasted like Stouffer's lasagna that has been microwaved, then refrigerated and heated up again as left overs. Server was nice, but uninformed on the menu and service was slow (the emptiness of the restaurant at 12:30PM should have been our first clue).  Trust me it is overrated, food is no bueno and the service is lacking. I hate dining and inquiring about food items and the server doesn't have a clue and either makes up answers or has to go to the kitchen for every answer. Hilarious!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised reading the reviews below.  Granted I've only been here once, but it was a great experience.  We had a group of 7 and requested a table with a view, and the Hostess quickly set something up for us.  Our server was friendly and quick to bring out waters, drinks, and our entrees, even putting some in boxes and bringing checks early to help those of us who were in a rush.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was delicious, as was the bread provided complimentary and the salad that came with the sandwich.  The view of the golf course is beautiful, and I'm excited to return to enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"Brought my husband to Isabella's last night for his birthday. It was our first time there. For a Sunday evening it was busy and we had a 25 minute wait to be seated at a table.   We sat at the bar until our table was ready and if it weren't for the two young girls sitting next to us, we might have received better service from the young, male bartender. Specialty drinks were too pricey. I tried the Skinny Martini and it was good. My husband tried the Moskow Mule, which was too gingery for our liking.   For dinner I ordered Deb's Pasta and my husband ordered the filet. My pasta was so so and nothing spectacular. However, I did like that they didn't skimp on the chicken pieces. My husband's filet was okay, but lacked in flavor and small for the price (6oz for $32) and the side of potatoes were over cooked. Not overly impressed with our entrees. We also ordered a bottle of Merlot and the waitress poured our wine into regular water glasses. \"Weird\" Especially when everyone around us who had wine also had wine glasses. We asked for wine glasses shortly after.   I'm giving Isabella's 3 stars primarily for the view and environment. I liked the outside seating and openness. I'm sure our experience and food would be better if we just had some beer and pizza.  I'm willing to give it another go."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We ordered the\"Butcher.\" Bartender was S L O W! Very focused on what, we still don't know! Doesn't look like they could multi task! Definitely come back for the food, but I'd sit at a table NOT the bar! We were even drinking Macallan Scotch! We call our experience, the \"Hunger Games!\""}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood restaurant- have been for brunch, lunch, dinner and my friends know how much I loved it and planned a surprise birthday dinner for me on the patio.  The wait staff is so friendly and the food is always delish! My absolute favorite place to sit outside and enjoy good food and good drinks in a beautiful setting"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, menu.  Great place to take visitors or small groups."}
{"text":"Last week I had a party of 40+ on the patio by the fireplaces. The crew is a Isabella's couldn't have performed better. They were organized, on the ball and ready to serve. The food was fantastic. Our servers, Holly and Emerald were attentive a to our many requests- keeping tables cleared and cocktails refreshed. Thanks to Laura, the catering manager for making it happen. This is a great organization."}
{"text":"The food is average at best, great staff and atmosphere right on the golf course. Just a bunch of 5 year olds running around screaming and sub par food."}
{"text":"Nice enough place, view service we're fine, crowd is kinda May / December Scottsfaley"}
{"text":"We had a large group of loud women and the staff was very gracious.  The views were beautiful and the decor was fun.     The drinks and food were well-priced, especially for North Scottsdale. Definitely worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now; the first time, was pleasantly surprised that they had live entertainment on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance reminds me of an upscale beach bar/restaurant sans the beach (well, there's sand if you count the sandtraps you see on the adjacent Grayhawk golf course!)  Food was delicious, and service decent. Several seating areas to choose from. Outdoor firepit areas are great for larger parties. Planning to return for a birthday celebration soon. Oh, and the best part? Rocking chairs!! Yessss!  :)"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and had been anticipating Isabella's since I saw the plans last spring with the patio views of the mountains and the city. The views are terrific. The food, not so much. The service was so - so but it's only been a few weeks so I trust it will improve. The food was very disappointing. The Salt & Pepper Shrimp appetizer was the highlight. The Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich was awful. I'm from the Midwest and it's not like any Italian Beef sandwich I've ever had and I've had a bunch. It had a funny taste. The House Tuscan Potato - \"you may never eat french fries again\" - was amazingly bad - seemingly partly cooked, starchy and stuck together with an unpleasant taste. I can't imagine how they made it so poorly and I would have loved any fast food fry instead. It must have taken extra effort to make these so terrible. The Linguini & Clams were passable but not better than OK. The server never stopped by after delivering the food to find out about how the meal was and first stopped by to bring check - therefore the bad service rating. If you go, sit at the bar or on the patio. Have some drinks and appetizers. Enjoy the terrific view. If you stay away from the main menu and the dining room and you will have a fine time."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view but the food was mediocre, service was par, sever brought out a wrong order."}
{"text":"Not going there again.   The bartenders were rude and the service was poor, again. The patio setting is nice but not enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"Great moment with our family and friends.Great salads and burgers. Setting view of the golf course. Everything was great. Enjoy your time"}
{"text":"Love the Crispy Chicken Sandwich - Lightly breaded chicken, cabbage slaw, lemon aioli, hoagie. Very tender and juicy. I ordered the side of red-skinned potato fries. Next time, I'll ask for more of the cole slaw on the sandwich. The pizza is pretty good and their daily specials are usually pretty damn good too! Bella's Mac (house-made shells, cheddar, ham and breadcrumbs) served piping hot is a meal all by itself...okay maybe with a salad. Its so rich and delish!   Izzy's just opened a few months ago and now its snowbird season...and Grayhawk is snowbird neighborhood...so people please...stop complaining about the wait. EXPECT it to be crazy busy until Spring. Otherwise, its a great neighborhood spot. Love it."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time at Isabella's.  When friends suggested we go there, we right away got online to check out the yelp reviews.  Based on comments, we had low expectations.  But WOW were we blown away!   From the moment we entered the door, the hostesses were extremely friendly.  The place was jam packed with people, so the energy was great. We sat inside and our server, Thad, was amazing. Super friendly, always smiling, and very attentive. To top it off, the food was tasty! Based on a previous review, we ordered the kale salad with chicken (and they loaded on the chicken!), and a pizza. We will most certainly be back!!  If your looking for a fun lively atmosphere, with great energy, good service, good food and an amazing setting- don't pass up Isabella's.  Especially idea for out of town guests or clients."}
{"text":"Good food with a great view!  We've had the same waitress a few times and she's excellent.  We really like the prosciutto pizza, but sometimes the spaghetti and meatballs is a little dry (We just ask for extra sauce).  It's sometimes loud inside on a weekend, but the patio is very nice."}
{"text":"I love coming here to sit out on the patio it really is a gorgeous view. I love their grapefruit vojito! The only downside is it is packed and they don't have a happy hour. Get here early or make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, awesome bruschetta and really good people watching.  Right on the golf course, try one of the pasta dishes and salt and pepper shrimp!"}
{"text":"Perfect kid friendly place **note that there are a ton of kids running around on the grass ** for a casual dinner with a beautiful view of the desert, golf course and sunset! Came here with my family to meet some friends and the vibe was great. Kids could run free and parents could get very tasty cocktails - highly recommend the Mexican Mule and traditional margarita. I'm gluten free and usually have a hard time finding decent pizza but loved my meal - quinoa salad and gluten free sausage. Kids loved their regular cheese pizza. Our waiter was really friendly but do think that the teenage hostesses could be more friendly and helpful. Overall, loved this place and will definitely come back but you need to come early. We came at 5pm and by 6:30 it had a line out the door."}
{"text":"My mom and sister set up a baby shower for me here and it was beautiful. The restaurant is bright, colorful, and the big open garage doors that look out on the golf course let in the most wonderful breeze. It looked like a lot of people were celebrating different things there (graduations, birthdays). The food was good but I wish I ordered something different. My mom ordered a pizza and that was very good. The salads were large and looked very tasty! I ordered the Clava sandwich. It was good but the chicken was a little dry. Next time I will go with a salad or pizza. I am sure this place is absolutely beautiful at night. I saw misters so even on a summer night that would be a great place."}
{"text":"I can't imagine Isabella's staying in business for long. The ambiance is good to watch the sunset but drinks are too pricey for the quality and the food is absolutely gross! I ordered a vege lasagna that should have embarrassed them. It had three 2 inch by 2 inch pieces of pasta in it. Flooded by marinara and a couple of asparagus chunks and horribly soggy, gross broccoli. Oh I didn't mention the cheese!.....there was NO cheese. Okay so there was a couple of nickel sized areas of piped on pungent cheese like something along the edges of the bowl. That doesn't count as cheese! How can you have a decent lasagna that doesn't have any mozzarella in it? My husband got spaghetti and meatballs. He's a big guy and only ate half because it was awful! It was his second visit here. he thought hed give it another try. hoping the bad food the first time was a fluke. We are wondering if the spaghetti noodles are just freeze dried ramen noodles? Looked like Ramen to us. Then we were given no bread. The salad dressing was wrong on his salad. We left hungry! Plus they have terrible seating that consists of cheap metal stools with no backs mixed in with wooden chairs with backs! Uncomfortable! We witnessed two sets of elderly couples that immediately left when they were shown to tables with this seating. I will never ever go back and have warned my friends against it as well. There are too many awesome restaurants in that price range that have excellent food and comfortable seating. I came home and ate cereal for dinner. Another thing...if you don't eat pork there isn't much to pick from. It is a very! Limited menu. Go eat Italian at DC  Ranch village. This place should've been a burger bar."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and well thought out.  It's too bad the menu sucks.  The drinks are a measured shot.  Had the poorest vodka on the rocks in the valley.  A measured shot for $11.00.? VERY limited menu items that included three sandwiches...four pasta dishes...and a few different salads.  Each item was more of an appetizer than a meal.  The pasta serving was the equivalent of a side order elsewhere.  The pizza's were more of a starter and NOT a meal.  For as sharp as the Grayhawk people seem to be...they have totally blown Isabella's for me.  WILL NEVER GO BACK due to EXPENSE and variety.  One salad. One pizza that had little topping Two vodka's one sangria one beer two pasta dishes (that were minuscule) $107.00.  What a screwing.  Left and grabbed a Jack in the Box burger. There are so many GREAT places to eat, I fear I pissed away a dinner on their slop.  Pass Pass Pass"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The bruschetta is great, but would be great to have more selection (especially if you have a bruschetta bar)-every one kinda has a sweet element. We prefer authentic, so it's a little eh. I haven't had the pasta yet, but have been told its good. Just went yesterday and had great service. A few months ago we had mediocre service. The location is great, especially sitting outside. The dessert cassata is delicious! It's a decent neighborhood place."}
{"text":"The most beautiful bar in town! Gorgeous outside seating and perfect for a birthday party. The food is amazing, the beers are as cold as can be, and the cocktails are fantastic. They have something for everyone! From meat to the meatless, you will be satisfied.   I highly recommend outside dining on a cool night. One of the best experiences at a restaurant I have ever had."}
{"text":"Really busy lunch crowd. Noise was higher than I expected, it was okay, not distracting   The wait staff were nice   Although I didn't like the lip on the water glass.   It made drinking feel awkward    Had the picado salad and my companion the Rueben sandwich.   His comment \"it was just okay and too soggy\".  Can't see how something could be even \"just okay\" if it was soggy   My salad was boring and uninspiring.  While nothing essentially was wrong with the salad it just felt like a bag of mixed greens were dumped in the bowl.  Maybe my views are slightly jaundiced after experiencing great fresh salads in  last week. As I write this I realize there was not  crispness in the salad.     Very average"}
{"text":"Been here about 8-10 times.  Waitresses are great, yet to have a good waiter.  Food is ok but overpriced.  The place relies on its setting and golf course views to draw.  Fun place for kids to run around and we always go w our kids but if just my wife and I out for dinner, we'd never do here.  I'm sure we will go again but when the bill comes I'm always feel like I'm paying way too much for the food/drinks."}
{"text":"I am rounding up because of the setting.  We were doing a parents night out with my group and the organizer chose this place.  They had reserved one of the high top tables near the entrance for us.  I was a little concerned when I saw that they only had this metal stools with a small square of vinyl in the middle.  As I expected, they were so painful.  We had people of every size and all out butts were hurting, as a matter of fact my friend ended up standing most of the time, because she couldn't take it anymore, yes, she had to eat standing up.  Now to the food, that was a royal disappointment.  I ordered the Islander pizza (8\"), my hubby had the butcher with added mushrooms and jalapeños. My friends were sharing the caesar salad and a larger Islander pizza and the other couple at the end had the entrees.  When the pizzas arrived, they were plopped in front of us and we were forgotten. No plates to put our slices.  We asked one of the servers, but she said dismissively, \"I'll get your server\".  My friend's husband got up, and pick them up, the plates were next to her.  Then noticed my hubby's pizza did not have the jalapeños.  Our server showed up and he said he would have them add it and put the pizza back in the oven for a minute.  I told him no thank you, and that was a good thing, the pizza crust was so tough, not a good thing.  For dessert we ordered the D\"Estate, which is described as butter cake, with lime/pineapple jam and coconut gelato.  There were 5 croutons and a small scoop of gelato, I don't mind if it is small, I try to limit my calories, but that poor excuse of a cake was terrible, we left the croutons there, not worth the calories.  On top of that we got our bill before we even got the dessert delivered.  My hubby mentioned that we had never been at a place where we would get the check before we got to the end of our meal.  We all paid our checks, before we got our desserts, who does that. By the way, when we arrived home the leftover pizza went straight into the trash can. Now, the place is beautiful and the only reason I would go back is to have a beer (I don't think they can screw that up) in the patio area by the greens."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place!   Love that their food is all organic. The olive appetizer has two types of mildly brined olives. I had fusilli with bolognese (but it was more like rotini).  The sauce was perfect as was the portion size. I had a bite of my friends ravioli.  While the freshness was delicious, the overall flavor of the cheese ravs was too sweet for me.  Looking forward to returning here again to try their pizza."}
{"text":"I'll agree with J.B. and Lisa K.  The people especially at the front need to be either trained, re-trained, or replaced.  The restaurateur should know that, the servers can either make or break the meal.  Here, the servers definitely break the meal.  Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Don't order the Shrimp Fettuccine!!! This was my first time having this dish. The shrimp weren't deveined. I realized after a couple bites of eating grit. I couldn't even eat the shrimp knowing I was eating poop.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"It's a fun place to go with a big group of friends. With indoor and outdoor bar seating I really enjoy sitting back on the patio. The blood orange margarita is my most preferable drink. The food there is decent. The service is as well."}
{"text":"First time ever at Isabellas kitchen, loved the views they were spectacular. Service was excellent. Food was great. I would definitely go back and visit again."}
{"text":"Amazing setting on the golf course, great ambiance at night with all the white lights and fire pits. Perfect place to sit outside with the kids and let them run around on the grass. Amazing drinks, friendly service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"The beautiful views of Greyhawk GC were easily surpassed by the menue items. I read elsewhere to try the bruschetta, and, like previous reviews, my words may still not do it justice. We split the 3 peice combo and all 3 selections were incredible. I added a small pizza and was amazed at the amount of toppings that such a thin, delicate and flavorful crust could hold. As for service, as for Lauren, she was up to the task of matching the views and food."}
{"text":"This was a great place my friends took me too before and that I just 'found' again.    I had a delicious sandwich sitting at the bar and had the great company of the charming Emily, who was a great bartender.  The view of the Valley and, the mountains, in the background, and the award winning golf course, should make this a place to must on anyone's list."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy happy hour...amazing views, relaxing environment, friendly staff and great drink selection.  I could get used to frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"Isabella's Kitchen is frustrating.  It's location and layout couldn't be better. It's situated on the Grayhawk golf course and offers amazing views of Scottsdale desert landscape.  The patio is great and when weather is nice, their bar has an open air feel to it.  Kids are also welcome and the patio suits families where their kids can roam around a bit, but not too far!  These are the positives.  The negatives are the unimaginitive and bland menu of pseudo-Italian fare.  Their menu reads like a golf clubhouse menu and their pasta choices read like a kids menu (spaghettie & meatballs, lasagna, fusilli).  Isabella's could easily become a top restaurant in Scottsdale if they re-vamped their menu and brought in a real chef.  This isn't a knock on their current staff, as they're doing what they have with the vision of their creator.  I'm not talking about a wildly creative menu either. Simple is good if it's executed well.  Right now, Isabella's offers neither. Only a nice view and great weather, but that's more of a nod to Scottsdale and Grayhawk.  Come for drinks only."}
{"text":"I've been here three separate times. On two of the three visits I've had horrible service. Based on my experience during my three visits, my rating is two stars overall; one star for the service and five stars for the view. The food is average, not great but not bad. It's very disappointing because I'd love to come here more often, but I just can't based on the service I've received. There are too many great patios in Scottsdale to suffer through it."}
{"text":"Pass on this place if your smart.  For better prices you can get a much better atmosphere with better clientele than what shows up at this place.    Very scary group of people and I would not expect such low brow people in this area.    Food was bad as well."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes without being approached for even a glass of water. Wish I could rate the food we just never got to that point. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever experience.  We were a party of 7 and it took 2 full hours from the time we sat down at a table until we received dinner.  After all this waiting, one of the orders was wrong.  After another 15 minutes or so the manger came over and said the cook forgot to make the corrected order.  The person who never got their order said forget it but when we received the bill, the order that was never received was on the bill.  Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"A wonderful atmosphere, great service, and delicious food in the nicest part of Scottsdale!  A great time with friends and highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday at lunch time. The setting of this place is neat. We sat on the patio which had great views of the mountains and is right on the green golf course. There were misters and fans, keeping it quite comfortable in about 90 degree weather.  This place is pretty much just Italian food. The entire left column of the menu is pizzas. My husband and I wanted to order a large pizza, as did the other couple we were with. The server/kitchen would not allow us to do a half-and-half pizza. For example, you couldn't get a Hawaiian pizza with the ham only on one half.  This is very unaccommodating and super unusual for a pizza place. The alternative is for one person to pick off what they don't like or for people to be forced to buy their own pizza.  I don't find this to be customer-service friendly.  It left me with a negative impression of the restaurant and I don't think I would go back.  All that being said, the food was good and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite environments. The energy is great and we loved the prickly pear margarita and the Fig Mule. The food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The golf course setting is beautiful and appropriate. The Atmosphere is nice for a girl's night, girls lunch, or just a couple of drinks. Of course I'm sure the golfers and men like to eat here as well, but I'm a girl, so that's what I think of. The salads are fantastic, the drinks are good, and as mentioned, the atmosphere and view are amazing. I'm sure I'll be around again!"}
{"text":"3.5 star  Great neighborhood bar for a casual get-together. The food is ok and this trip we had great service. Good, clean spot to down a beer or two and roll on."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Isabellas very much, the food was amazing and the wine and the view was incredible.  We loved our server Mckenna. It's nice to be treated with such respect and have amazing service from such a pretty girl in Scottsdale. When we go to places like Bottled Blonde or Cheeseburgers we always get treated with a little bit less of service then we would like we are very impressed I will probably be sitting in her section again!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Appetizers were awesome. Had three types bruschetta and artichoke dip both were fantastic. Good draft beers. Pizzas were great crusts and cooked perfectly. Deserts were great. Kids meals were fantastic (mac n cheese/grilled cheese). Smaller menu but good selections.   Slowest service I've had in long time. Plan for long visit. Had to flag down server at least four times for attention."}
{"text":"The martinis are fun to try... the food is pricey for what it is - don't bother with the pizza... beet salad is good but WAY overpriced. Go for a cocktail and the view."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Terrible service, they act like they are doing you a favor by making you a drink. Pricey for a martini is $15 and wine runs in the $15 glass range."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular. If you like outdoor patios with a romantic and relaxing ambiance, this place is where you should try! I went for dinner here recently and I was thoroughly pleased with the food and atmosphere of my dining experience. It's Italian food so you'll want to be in the mood for some bruschetta or pasta! I can eat pasta for every meal so I was pretty excited to try their dishes. I was able to sample their macaroni and cheese, several of their bruschetta appetizers, and pasta. Each dish had very good flavor! This place was packed on a Wednesday night so I may recommend getting reservations or planning accordingly as it seems to be a hot spot for multiple groups - families, friends, dates. I can't wait for my next trip here!"}
{"text":"Isabella's does NOT feature a happy hour.  What they do have in its absence is ambiance and unparalleled scenery from the patio seating overlooking Grayhawk's Talon course.  The appetizers were tasty and plentiful. We had a meat and cheese plate and some olives. With two glasses of wine, a cocktail and a beer, the bill was sixty bucks. It would be at least half that anywhere else featuring a happy hour.  A decent buzz was was going to cost a fortune, so we called it an early night, went home and watched some really fucked-up chick movie.   Not going back anytime soon. I left Isabella's hungry and pissed-off. I don't know which was worse. Isabella's or Amanda Seyfried's bad acting. Jury's still out."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, don't bother making a reservation!  We did and had to wait 45 minutes for a table while other guests who arrived after us were seated right away.  We sat down at  a table at the bar and we were told by the hostess it was reserved, she left and then returned with a reserved sign and plopped it down in the middle of the table. The hostesses were rude and when my friend  inquired  about our table they gave her  the stink eye as soon as she turned around."}
{"text":"I'm torn. The atmosphere was absolutely fabulous- as was the flavor of Bella's Mac, until I found a stringy piece of plastic in it...   My meal was comped but I hate to say I will have a tough time trying it again. And our waitress was snooty- she must be confused on the requirements for a job in the service industry?"}
{"text":"We fell in love with this restaurant before we even ordered our food. And then fell a little more when we actually ate our meal. The decor is on point, especially the Christmas decorations. So cute and cozy. We would have loved to sit on the patio if it weren't so cold outside. They do have fire pits though, so maybe next time. The service was great, awesome wine selection and really good pizza and salads. We love our pizza so we can get a bit picky. They passed the test. This could possibly be our new favorite restaurant. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"A friend told me to check this place out so i popped in for a look.  Bar was packed, standing room only so i stood and waited for a bartender to acknowledge me which was about 15 minutes. Ordered a glass of cab $12....very Scottsdale I stalked the bar for an open seat so i could order some food, another 20 minutes. I went simple and got the Margarita pizza, all dough no cheese and no sauce. Two more glasses of wine was my real dinner. Not a great first impression but very cool layout and they just opened so I'll give them another try"}
{"text":"Put this place in a strip mall and it becomes a slightly better looking cousin then Macaroni Grill.  The food isn't exceptionally memorable. Don't worry though, what sets this place apart is its atmosphere and location.  Spend some time on the patio and casually watch the pink skies light up Camelback at sunset while your kids frolic on the golf course.  You will be hard to pressed to find anywhere else in the Valley that affords you that kind of experience."}
{"text":"Very nice location but that's about it. Food is nothing special. Patrons are mostly pretentious so it's not the friendliest place around."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great views, and GREAT for eating out with kids. We are able to bring our 4 and 2 year olds to play on the grass while we eat out in the patio."}
{"text":"Great views and atmoshphere.  Friendly service and a casual setting. Opening days are always exciting and starting with a limited menu was a great idea. Giving them time to work out the kinks and improve in areas they find that need it.  I was dissapointed in the bread and olive oil. The bread had the grill marks on it but it came out cold and with a burnt taste.The olive oil was tasteless with no Italian Spices in it.The pizza crust was also tasteless but the sausage was wonderful. They say they make their own sausage and it is delicious.I am sure they are working on their recipes. The salads looked amazing and I will definitly be back with my husband and family. I will give them some time and come back and try their signature Mac and cheese! It wasn't on the menu today. That is what we wanted to order. We will be back and look forward to many family dinners on their patio. Good luck!"}
{"text":"My first time, though I've wanted to go for quite awhile.  Three gals.   Food:  salad B, sandwich A, Service C- Loved the decor and style. Really lovely view.   Great place to bring out of towners."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great views, good service, and we had fun;) we're Scottsdale locals, and this is definitely a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"First class joint and a place if you want to be seen. It is a great place for older well to do guys, to pick up 20 and 40 year old arm candy.  It's a blah, blah, I own this and we went there. Oh and p.s. my house and car are better than yours.   Great patio with cool fire pits. Lots of casual places to chill here. Looks like a totally fun establishment and a great place to drag your top water lure and snag a fun one! However, I only have eyes for one! You-TK #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Service was was average at best. We only tried one dish the bologonese it was a 6/10."}
{"text":"Great service from Brittany. She was hospitable, energetic and a delight. The restaurant has the most beautiful view of the golf course and city lights. I love the layout, decor and ambiance. The food is good. I normally get the mushroom pizza and kale salad. I think their pizza ranks amongst the best. This place is fun and really morphs you into a vacation mood. Great place."}
{"text":"What an atmosphere! This restaurant gets five stars for atmosphere alone and four stars for food, so therefore I will go with four stars all around. Driving past this little eatery, you would have no idea it's such a charming and adorable spot. It's located along the Grayhawk golf course, so you get the views of the golf course, mountains and the city all in one. The restaurant itself has an open and airy atmosphere with a perfect patio as well as an indoor dining area that is still open to the outdoors with large garage doors.   Be warned, this restaurant fills up very quickly, so don't expect to saunter in on a Friday night at 6:00 without a reservation or hour wait time. However, the plus side is that they do accept reservations and it's a super kid-friendly restaurant that allows the parents to sit back and enjoy some drinks and an inviting atmosphere.   The food here has an Italian theme and is pretty decent, however, I don't think anyone comes here for the food. I think they come here for the full package...at least that's why I love it! Their sandwiches are really good and don't be fooled by the word \"potatoes\" as an option for your side. Their \"potatoes\" are actually French Fries."}
{"text":"My family and I love Isabella's Kitchen!  Great ambiance, great food and great service!  We make a point of going there at least once a week and are never disappointed!! I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, sat at the bar. Very attentive staff, food came out pretty fast for a party of 4, I had the turkey sandwich with garden salad. It was delicious, bread was warm and tender and tasted freshly baked. Salad was fresh, rest of the party had fruit bruschetta which I didn't try but looked lovely. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this neighborhood gem  It's patio dining area are really quite something, this is what AZ is all about the beautiful scenery and perfect weather this time of year I can't say that during the summer heat !   The hostess was sweet & prompt  We like that !! The music was light rock & just the perfect volume  Plenty of seating although we us to wait a good 15 min but that was ok as we enjoyed a drink & the scenery  The food is very yummy I always get their salads which are fresh, just the right size and full of flavor, I'm a ranch fan and they have a buttermilk which is a solid 8  The Italian vinaigrette is my second choice which is also an 8.  Prices are reasonable all kids meals are $6 and salads range from $9-$15  We will keep coming back for the deliciousness"}
{"text":"Save your time and money and skip eating here. A limited menu, with small portions of bland food. However, the outside area is nice for drinks, with fire pits & comfortable lounges."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The food is absolutely delicious. The staff really takes great care of you. Truly a great part of the golf experience at Grayhawk Golf Club."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, a lovely restaurant décor and overall friendly place to stop in for a beverage or bottle of wine and watch the sunset."}
{"text":"I came here for a rehearsal dinner and was very impressed.Sometimes I am a little weary when going to catered events because the selection is not always the best. However, Isabella's had a really nice spread. They had a lot of vegetarian options and some delicious meat entrees. Everything I sampled, I liked. Not to mention, the atmosphere here is very cool. There is a beautiful view from the patio. It's perfect for a night out with close friends or for a date. The inside had a nice ambiance, as well. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites! We had our welcome party, instead of a rehearsal here for our wedding. It was perfect. The patio setup and food was delicious. Everyone raved about the ambience, food and views!  It was definitely a night to remember. We also go here as our local spot to just sit back, relax and enjoy the beautiful AZ weather."}
{"text":"Met with my book club on a gusty Wednesday night, but we were seated on a protected patio, so was it very nice.  Disappointed they ended up separating us between two tables.  :(  Guess there weren't any options?  Our server was very nice, did a great job of managing 15 happy ladies with 15 checks! I enjoyed a nice glass of Meiomi and ordered the calamari appetizer and a owl of potato and bacon soup. (I think it was bacon---it was potato and something). The soup arrived cold and very salty.  One bite and I had to send it back.  (I don't know---maybe it's me---north Scottsdale restaurants seem to be way-over salting their food!) The calamari was excellent, perfectly fried and hot and I appreciated that the Calabrian aioli---nice spice!---was served on the side and not dumped over the calamari.  Everyone seemed very pleased with their drinks (there were a lot of margaritas going on) and their meals, which were mostly appetizers.    I am definitely bringing DH back here for a nice, casual dinner!"}
{"text":"Lovely place with a wonderful patio. Meat and Cheese board was outstanding, but my favorite was \"Bella's Mac.\"  Homemade pasta, ham, breadcrumbs. Yummmm. Excellent service though we were there when it was quiet. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am giving this venue two stars for (1) the location of the restaurant and (2) because our appetizers were decent. Otherwise, we will not be returning to this establishment.  Isabella's sits on Grayhawk's Golf Course and has beautiful views from their patio. If you have the opportunity to sit outside, do it. They have table seating outside along with rocking chairs and cushions around fire pits. It is a nice ambiance.   After being greeted by three hostesses for dinner, we were seated inside at a high top table inside of the small seating area. It was very loud; I could barely hear myself speak. For appetizers, we ordered the roasted brussels sprouts and the mac n cheese, which both were good. For the entrees, we ordered the Butcher's 8\" pizza, which was COVERED in what seemed like 3 lbs of different kinds of meat. It was uneatable. It also came out luke-warm. We also ordered the Southwest Caesar with added grilled chicken which was a joke. The chicken was cold and barely grilled. The salad was topped with raisins, dry tomatoes, and large slices of what I can only guess was pasteurized american cheese. The salad costs $18, which is ridiculous!!!!  Now onto the service. This restaurant was clearly run by girls and boys who are in high school and/or college and would rather talk with their friends visiting at the bar than ensure the patrons are taken care of. We sat waiting for our check for over 7 minutes, not to mention all of our waters were empty and never refilled halfway through the meal. When our server finally noticed none of us were eating anymore, he didn't ask if we wanted to box any leftovers up (we definitely didn't anyways) and took the credit card right away. Once he returned with our check, he went back to talking to his friends at the bar. Sub-par service at best. Don't waste your time dining here. This place is suited for after golf cocktails on the patio at best."}
{"text":"Yummy Ceasar Salad, the croutons were crispy and rich. A little heavy on the meat items... I know, I know, it's an Italian restaurant but they could still have a couple extra options available (they are currently running on a limited menu to start but they WILL have more soon). The server was very friendly and I am looking forward to seeing this place blossom. It was pretty good for an opening day :)"}
{"text":"Wow!   I am not sure what happened to this place.  Very different than after it first opened.  Apparently they are content to rely on the beautiful location.  That really was the only positive.  We have been here before and were happy with it, bu this was a very disapointing Mothers Day visit.  So so food at best and terrible, terrible service  Who trains the staff here?  Not sure if we will return.  We certainly will not be referring our friends anymore.  So sorry...Did the original owner depart?"}
{"text":"It was Sunday date night with my husband.  He wanted to take me some place different.  I'm always up for a new place.    As we walked into the restaurant the view took my breath away.... this place is located right on top of a golf course.  Amazing views!   We decided to order a pizza pie, olives  and of course a bottle of Riesling wine. The pizza was okay, nothing to write home about but decent. The olives, of course I loved.    We didn't order anything crazy just some snack foods. Next visit we're going to go in but this time the view had me at HELLO!"}
{"text":"Ok I was ready to give a bad review due to some of the other reviews I read   But I can't I have to be totally honest . This place is great the place looks awesome the decor is great . The view is incredible with a inside bar that opens to the patio. The service was actually really good sever kept my ice filled for my husband and wine for me . I had the Margarita pizza and my husband had the sausage and peppers which had a spicy kick which he loved , my pizza was awesome. The place was great and we will come again . Only down fall was the price a bit pricey   We ordered a 8 \" pizza ,  sausage sandwich / comes with fries , 1 Bloody Mary , 3  wines they call glass and half wine and a ice tea.     81.00 buck.  Wine itself was 42.00    Like I said a bit pricey, if they had some happy hour menu this place would be really packed.   But the service was great and the food was amazing . Don't mind paying a little extra for great food    Will be back"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Possibly the worst bruschetta in North Scottsdale.  Came to enjoy dinner with my daughter and didn't eat a thing. So disappointed in the quality of the food. The ambiance is great so maybe a couple drinks and no dinner is the norm for everyone."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks.  Outside seating fun and comfortable.  Food is always good.  Staff always friendly.  Very polite always smiling.  Draft beer selection extent and frosty mugs a favorite.  Spectacular views and sunset happy hour"}
{"text":"Great view, best in the North Valley. Food okay. Service so-so. But don't go here if you want to carry on a conversation with your dinner-mates, the music is too loud. Maybe I'm getting old, but I don't go out to dinner to listen to music. Try the Taverna American just down the street, their patio isn't nearly as beautiful, but you'll enjoy talking with your friends and the food is just as good and the service is better."}
{"text":"After a day of disappointing golf at Grayhawk, we capped it off at Isabella's Kitchen, which is across the street from the golf course clubhouse.  A friend of mine highly recommended this place, so I was excited to finally give it a try.  I ordered:  Racer 5 IPA, $6 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/isabellas-kitchen-scottsdale?select=Jvt8bpmR964stNcC3gV3cg#Jvt8bpmR964stNcC3gV3cg  Anchor Steam, $6 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/isabellas-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WiRprsEABqMxLtgwPohFOQ#WiRprsEABqMxLtgwPohFOQ  Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza, $12 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/isabellas-kitchen-scottsdale?select=H2BGJHa1Tgb2-oh0WmVLdA#H2BGJHa1Tgb2-oh0WmVLdA  The Pizza was good....fresh ingredients and just the right amounts of Sauce, Cheese, and Toppings.  It made for a nice meal after a day of golf in the hot sun.  I'm impressed by their selection of Craft Beer and the Racer 5 IPA went down smooth.  The service was average....had to waive down our server a few times.  Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"I've been to Izzys dozens of times over the last few years. The food is simple but always well prepared. The wait staff is attentive. The views are great, particularly on a hot summer evening. Nice crowd and casual feel. My number one choice for drinks or a casual dinner in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so predictable it's deflating. I might put myself to sleep writing this. I'd like to write a thorough, in depth, review but honestly I just can't bring myself to put aside that much of my time for this place.   Let me start by saying I've lived in No. Scottsdale for 15 years. Seen it all.   If you enjoy a bar that caters to the elite and the 'who do you know' crowd this is the place for you. The staff and food is as shallow as their attempt at making pizza, which, unfortunately, is what I ate for  dinner.  Sauce-no taste, nothing stood out on my sausage and onion pizza. Go to Lamp Pizza at Pinnacle Peak and Pima. They know what they're doing.   That's all I got. Nice atmosphere no soul at Isabella's :P"}
{"text":"The view is beautiful.  On a sunny breezy day, sitting on the patio overlooking the golf course, is fabulous and relaxing.  But the food is really not special.  I ordered the bruschettas. I'm not a big fan of hard bread.  Never understood why people would enjoy the razor sharp edges of the bread.  This place served one of the hardest bread.  I dare say the atmosphere is much better than the food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our lunch here yesterday. We had the friendliest server and great food! I got just the house salad with shrimp (shrimp was a little pricey considering you only get three pieces) but the bruschetta and calamari were the die for! Honestly the calamari was like really, really good. But overall we had a great time here yesterday. The prices are reasonable, the view of the golf course was beautiful and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The view and ambience are a 5.   I don't think I have seen a prettier view than their outside patio has; and a plus is there is plenty of seating.   Another great thing, if you have kids, they can play out on the lawn after the course is closed.  Reason #1 I am only giving a 3 is because the food was just average.   My quinoa salad was very overdressed and the pizza was just run of the mill.  The couple we were with also felt that way about their meals...not bad, not great.  And one last comment, they don't have a Gluten Free menu, which is odd in this day.  Our friend had a difficult time finding something on the menu she could order.  Reason #2 I am only giving a 3 is that they are pretty pricey for what you get.   They have no happy hour or specials and the drinks are very expensive...typical North Scottsdale overpricing.  As our waitress told us 'we don't have to have a happy hour.'  Reason #3 is regarding the service.   It wasn't because our server was inattentive.  She was very attentive...but to the point that we felt she was trying to get us to order and get our of there.   We really wanted to enjoy the sunset and then have a leisurely dinner but felt rushed the whole time.  And for what we were spending, it would have probably been beneficial not to rush us.   If she would have backed off, I probably would have given her a 4.5.   I would assume its management that insists tables are turned quickly and the servers are just under pressure from them.  Go for the view but be prepared to pay a high price for it and don't have too high of expectations for the food."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of co-workers and absolutely LOVED it. We sat on the patio - right on the golf course - it was so sunny and the grass was so green and flowers were blooming, it was honestly gorgeous. I recommend sitting on the patio if the weather allows!  I had the fish tacos and tried the pear/blue cheese/pine nut bruschetta. All of it was soooo goooooood. Nothing is too heavy, really fresh and so yummy. I wanted to try everything.   I feel like the biggest compliment you can give a restaurant is to come back with your friends and family, and I've already told my fiancé I want to bring him here!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Scottsdale for people watching. Everyone is usually very friendly - great happy hour on Friday.  Food is good - not exceptional - but again the drinks are all very good and the wait staff is top notch.  Older crowd - so if your a 20 something and want to knock the place because it fails to play the most current rap music....you are welcome to stay away."}
{"text":"A dear friend held a birthday luncheon for her Mom at this very nice restaurant on Grayhawk Golf course, and we all had a great time. We were a party of 10 and our waitress server was amazing she was very accommodating and friendly and engaging. My vegetarian quinoa salad was good and the others had pizza some salads and some sandwiches and they all seemed very happy with their selections. Someone shared their pizza - it was great. There were a few other tables occupied but mainly at the bar was what seem to be a crew of golfers from out-of-state and  couple people outside on the patio - it was 106° !! I will definitely return probably in the evening with my husband seems like a nice getaway for a date night and it's only a couple miles from my home."}
{"text":"We made a reservation with Claudia for my sister's bachelorette party dinner, and we couldn't have asked for a better time. We got a round table for the 5 of us, so we could all sit across from one another and chat. It was situated in a beautiful spot outside and the weather wasn't bad at all. There are fans and misters on the patio, just in case though. The food was great, too! We ordered manicotti, a burger, salads, and another shrimp pasta entree. For dessert we got the Italian pudding and zeppoles, and both were delicious! Overall, we had an awesome experience and we will definitely be returning in the future! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"A great hide away off the beaten path. FRESH would definitely describe the cuisine. We tried the meat and cheese board and the Hummus tray to start. Both wonderfully prepared and presented. Dinner was lite and early for us this evening. Caesar with shrimp and chicken was our entrée selection for the boys. Ravioli and Bolognese for others. Nothing but complements. We enjoyed the patio and golf course views. Just a nice experience. We will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian (healthy too!) restaurant at Gray Hawk in N. Scottsdale! Love that they offer patio seating w/padded chaise lounges/chairs and illuminated white lights strung over you! Such a great touch.  The views are pretty great, you can see the nicely groomed course while you dine. Service was cheerful and attentive (almost too much?).  I had the Islander pizza which consisted of pineapple, speck (Italian-style Prosciutto) and thinly-sliced jalapenos. Perfect combo for me and I was happy. My very health-conscious friend had the Kale Salad with chicken. I felt a slight twinge of guilt, but still enjoyed my pie and took some home for later.  I'll def be back for more!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in PHX or Scottsdale...  Order the cheese board as an appetizer, then you have to try the spaghetti and meatballs.  Phenomenal atmosphere, great live music and \"the place\" to take any out of town guest."}
{"text":"My favorite beet salad ever!! I do wish they had more fire pit seating out back but thats my only critique. Great place to watch the sunset!"}
{"text":"Nothing special in terms of food.  Nice atmosphere for happy hour. The food was just ok. I would only go back for drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. The ravioli was amazing!! I will definitely be back to try more pasta options. We sat at the bar had a great view of the golf course and not to mention the drinks were on point . Nate the GM really gave a personalized experience!"}
{"text":"Isabella's is a beautiful neighborhood restaurant and bar, they have a wonderful open dining area that really let's you enjoy the beautiful views and the sunny Arizona weather. I came for lunch and sat at the bar, I had a lovely glass of wine and my sausage and peppers sandwich was yummy! Service was fantastic and my dining companions pizza looks super spectacular! Prices weren't astronomical and it's def on my list of places to check out for dinner and I will for sure be back just to have a cocktail, app and sit on their patio!"}
{"text":"Great location for lunch.  Love the prickly pear margarita and the calamari appetizer.  Outside seating can be a little quirky.  I had the ruben with grilled sourdough instead of rye and it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to wrap up the weekend.  Kids playing in the grass, hanging with friends.  Yummy food and FOOTBALL!"}
{"text":"Stingiest portion of tortellini I've ever received.  This menu item should be on appetizer menu."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to join in and not give this place much credit like the other reviewers.  Wish I could though b/c it's got a great set up.  Love the open airiness about it and all the great sitting places.  B/t that and the waiter, that's the only thing I liked about here. My cousin saw this place since he lives nearby so he wanted to check it out.  I got the peasant pasta b/c they say their pasta is handmade.  The dish had great flavor (marinara sauce with italian bacon and breadcrumbs) but the pasta was horrible.  First off, it was a bucatini pasta which is a thick spaghetti with a hollow hole in it.  Well when I got the pasta, it wasn't al dente at all.  It was hard and raw.  I bit into several pieces and could feel a hardness and saw whiteness - like raw dough.  The waiter was great and got me another one.  This was better but I still found raw, hard pieces in it.  Too hungry to send it back again.  After this it dawned on me - hey, if it was \"handmade\" why was it HARD?  I've made fresh pasta and well, raw I can understand.  Hard - huh?  That would only be if the pasta was dried.  Hmmm...a bit misleading.  When i think handmade, I think fresh.  I think this pasta was made by hand but maybe they make it in large batches ahead of time and dry it out to use later?    My cousin got the lasagna - meat with white sauce.  The waiter said the white sauce isn't like your typical thick alfredo sauce.  It did look lighter than that.  But cousin says they could have added more noodles.  Too much meat for him.    Maybe it's worth another try but seeing as how the other reviews aren't good either, I'd rather go to Andreoli's Grocer.  Now that's a truly AUTHENTIC italian place."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour the patio is beautiful with a pleasant view of the sunset, the food good with an Italian twist, the service is great every one is very nice. If you haven't tried it yet I suggest you do!"}
{"text":"Hohum food. Nothing special here except the view. Great spot for drinks and snacks. Patio seating during cool months.  # server actually warning me *against* what I asked for. Thanks a lot, but it's not a good sign. new chef needed? # sharp scampi drowning in wine. Blechy sauce reminds me of cheap gloppy Chinese lobster sauce. shrimps bouncy, approaching rubbery. # Chicken Caesar blabla nothing special at all # pasta served cool. Sauce greasy and not fresh. I can have cold-food-leftovers-style at home, GODDAMIT! # meatball sandwich uninspired, hohum.  Service was attentive despite other reviews here, but the pace was empty. Even the manager seems unconvinced about the ability of the kitchen to execute.  Great view of the golf course and surrounding area. Just wish the food packed the same wow factor.  Meh."}
{"text":"Girls night out and the weather couldn't have been better.  The sunset on the golf course - Gorgeous.  Cucumber Mule - Delicious.  We split a pizza, salad and olive appetizer.  All of it was yummy.  It's a bit pricey, but what do you expect at Grayhawk.  I heard it can get really crowded, but we went during the week around 7 and had no problems getting in.  I will go back with my hubby next time and see what he thinks."}
{"text":"Love this place for the cool views, great atmosphere and awesome handmade pasta dishes. I don't look at this place as a destination location but I did enjoy all my visits thus far. I live in the grey hawk community so it is very convenient for me. Walking distance. The only knock I have can be the service. Some staff is simply inexperienced or in need of better training. I go and sit at the bar or in the fire pit couches. The Racer IPA is my new favorite brew. And the Mac n cheese is stupid good."}
{"text":"We were invited for a night out by some friends, and they chose Isabella's.  At first, I was confused.  We're we going to the club house of a golf course??  Let me say, it was FAR from it!  This place is GORGEOUS!!  It has an awesome open flow of energy to the place.  You walk by a nice front patio seating area as you enter.  Once you are inside, you almost feel like you are still outside.  It was a nice night out, so all the roll up doors were open to the back seating area outside.  And the decor was very unique and creative.  They have a great indoor/outdoor bar.  So we sat there and ordered some drinks, while we waited for our table to be available.    Once we were seated at our table, we ordered a few more drinks and some appetizers.  We ordered the stuffed jalapeños and the bruschetta.  The jalapeños smelled great, but they lacked flavor.  The were not very hot either, not in temperature or taste.  The bruschetta choices came out great and well presented.  Three different pizzas were ordered, as well as their taco plate, for the main dishes.  Fresh basil was on the pizzas, which was a nice touch.  The tacos were Carne Asada and were paired up with fresh tortillas and beans.  Once we finished our meals, we couldn't quite leave.  We were too in love with how comfortable this place was.  So we moved to the back patio area.  We nestled into some of their comfy lounge chairs and enjoyed the nice weather we were having.   We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience working with Lauren Anderson coordinating our wedding reception.  We chose the site after having dined here for smaller birthday parties and the view is outstanding.  There was also a little snafu with the original site of our ceremony, and Isabella's Kitchen was able to accommodate all of our needs.  Our guests raved about the buffet.  It truly was our dream wedding. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Drinks are great!  Food is great!! Ambiance is incredible!!  This place suits the Arizona weather better than any place in town!  The patio is a special place and the views are in credible!!"}
{"text":"Lunch with a view! Location location location! you can not beat the relaxing views here of the Gray hawk golf course! We loved sitting bar side taking in the lush green landscape while enjoying our lunch. We had the quinoa salad and fried chicken sandwich and a couple of iced teas! Food was good, the view and ambiance even better."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and very nice atmosphere inside and out.  Great patio.  Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, friendly.  Food was not good, however. The flavor (or lack thereof), in the short rib pasta was disappointing.  Even more disappointing was the sausage and peppers.  Yuck!  The sausage was so dried out it had no flavor other than hot/spicy.  The server didn't ask why I barely touched it.  We did have the meat and cheese board.  It was okay, but pricey for what we received.  It was an elitist crowd, but had the food been great, it would have made sense."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good dinner the other night.  We really liked the atmosphere.  We are inside but went outside after.  Nice view out over golf course.   For appetizers we had the shrimp and chips salsa.  The shrimp I was not a big fan of but primarily from the yellow sauce that came with them.   On their own they were pretty good.   For main course the pizza was excellent and highly recommend.   The meat lasagna and manicotti - both were good except the meat.  The Italian sausage just did not give either a good flavor and their was a lot of it.  However the tomato sauce and cheeses were so good I would come back and order again except go with the meatless versions.   Overall a nice dinner but did not wow me enough to give a really high rating."}
{"text":"Great spot situated on the golf course in north Scottsdale.  Seems to be the hang out for people having a cocktail before they head home from work.  It's also a great spot to bring young kids as they can run around the fairways with flashlights at night. Make a reservation as it gets really, really crowded.   Good selection of food and wine."}
{"text":"Went here for a rehearsal dinner, so I didn't get the full effect. The staff was very friendly, but the food was lacking. It was very plain. The lasagna was decent, but only a step above the frozen stuff you buy at the super market. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The pizza was actually pretty good. I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but decided to give them 4 because we left our giant 15 passenger van in the valet lot for two days and they didn't tow us."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work for a quick drink and bit. When I arrived, 4:30pm, the place was empty, but by 5:30 it was easily half full.  The don't take reservations so come early to avoid the lines. Not sure why everyone is standing in line though.  When I was the only one at the bar, the bartender was friendly and accommodating, but as soon as a few others showed up it became more and more rare to have her stop by. I did order food, which I thought was so-so (potato on a pizza).  She said it was some type of specialty but I thought it was underseasoned and lacked any real flavor. They have a small choice of beers, but did have a couple that I liked. All in all it, hopefully, is a work in progress and will improve.  It is a beautiful restaurant on a beautiful property with a great outside patio area, just improve the food and service."}
{"text":"Great location for N Scottsdale.  Good food ina nice setting beside the golf course.  Nice bar."}
{"text":"Unless you go here for as the 19th hole, don't bother. They don't take reservations, the first major ding. Unless you want to wait a long time in a crowded place, it's just not a pleasant place to be.  Give this a few months and it will be a golfer's join...  We won't be back...there are plenty of other decent local options where you won't need to wait around and look pretty."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Our girls night out was not a good experience. It was a very busy night and we ended up on the grass on benches. We seen a table of eight leaving and asked our server if we could be seated. Our server came back and said because it's so busy that it was reserved. About 30 min later...table is still available, so we ask again. Again we are told it's still reserved. A hour later as we are leaving table still available.  We may have stayed longer, spent more money if our back weren't killing us.  AND THEN... we all were double charged on our credit cards.  Here's the kicker when calling manage back about being doubled charged we got a salty snotty attitude.  And mentioned the table situation and was told \"we\" should have got a buzzer. Really. Never offered a \"buzzer\" This place is to nice to have Service like this."}
{"text":"Saturday night out with the family.   Great location on golf course but don't plan on seeing it without reservations.  Loud atmosphere inside with bar and basketball games on.  Many different types of seating inside with hi tops and tables and bar seating with open to outside.  Outside has sofa seating and tables.  The location is part of Grayhawk and lots of kids here playing in grass area. Food was just okay and lower end of my pizza rating and salad was okay too.  Hunter our server was great and kept my ice tea full.  I recommend calling ahead for reservations outside especially in the Spring."}
{"text":"Friday evening happy hour review.... Great views and setting and atmosphere. Drinks are over priced. But that's ok as it is Scottsdale. But what is not ok is the attitude of the bartenders. Can't stand when they keep there heads down and never scant the bar. No matter how busy you are true professionals make eye contact and let you know they know you are waiting. Evidently chewing gum is more important than service.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING......food, ambience, service!!!!!!! We have finally found our favorite place in Scootsdale/Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Really nice food. Great, resorty-golf atmosphere. Comfy tables right near golf course and range. Staff is super tolerant of children and that makes it a great local dinner spot for families.  Beautiful city lights and mountain views make you feel like you're on vacation for a couple of hours.  Also a good happy hour or working lunch spot (although as other yelpers have noted there are no \"happy hour\" specials.  Some people may not be \"blown away\" by the food, and I agree it's not incredible, but it's better than many places in North Scottsdale. I always enjoy the salads, bruschetta and prosciutto pizza. Was not a huge fan of the burrata (which could have been much better.)"}
{"text":"This place is all about the view. Go for the tranquilty and atmosphere. They have great pizzas and Bruchettas. A little over priced for my liking but to each their own."}
{"text":"The reason why I am giving  this restaurant 1 star is because they have the audacity to charge $9,00 for street corn (1 piece of corn on the cob with some seasoning on it) That is just insane. We did not know the price because it is not listed as a side dish on the menu. It is served with as a side dish with their ribs. We asked our waitress if we could just get the street corn.  I will say the atmosphere is great and they have a terrific outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Came to Isabella's for a nice dinner. The view to the golf course is awesome. We had our ups and downs with the food. we started off with the bruschetta which was decent-- not the best we've had though. The entrees were good-- we got the salmon and steak, both had nice flavors and was cooked well. The dessert though was TERRIBLE. Tiramisu is one of my favorites and Isabella's kitchen literally had THEEE worst tiramisu I've ever had. Texture was dense and flavor was inedible. I literally took a micro-bite and pushed it away. major bummer-- perhaps a new pastry chef would not be a bad idea."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome The food and views are spatular! If you haven't been, you are missing out! Come for Romantic sunsets or happy hour after a round of golf"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Isabella's with our 1.5 year old kids. We did not have a reservation on a pretty busy night, but the staff was able to accommodate us with a table.  The hostess was very pleasant as well as the wait staff.   The food was very good, but the outdoor area really makes this a special place. Our kids had so much fun running around in the outdoor lawn with other kids.  It's easy to watch them while sitting on a rocking chair or a picnic bench.  As out of towners, but regular visitors to Scottsdale, we will make Isabella's a regular stop."}
{"text":"Very considerate and attentive staff. Great atmosphere,  well thought out layout, nicely decorated and homie warmth throughout. Intelligently creative interior design.  The patio is lovely and wraps around the restaurant and bar. It does seem to be important to be mindful there are residents who live within earshot of the outdoor section.   Pizza was an A+, food was hot, and servers have a great attitude and check on you periodically. This is a cozy, 'don't-wana-leave' type of place and I am happy to live so close by.   Tonight was a great experience and albeit we forgot to take home our left-overs, we will return!   As an important side note; I can tell the neighbors likely also love the view here, so we did our best to respect their privacy, and ambient noise while outside. I grew up on the beach in California and visitors were always considerate near our home so we have personal experiences with returning the favor!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is unbeatable. If you want to catch a sunset with a glass of wine in North Scottsdale, this is the place to do it. The food is good - not spectacular, but consistently good. Personally, I find their apps/salads typically shine brighter than their entrees, so I usually will opt to just split a few apps with the table if I'm given the option. Service at the bar is always excellent, service at a table is always just okay. Overall, the cocktails and the vibe make Isabella's a must-try."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing experience here this evening. I called ahead to make a 6 pm reservation for my husband, myself and our toddler but was told that reservations were full for this evening but we could call ahead of time and put our name in. Okie dokie, no problem. Called at 5 to put our name in for 6, was told that we have to call 30 min before when we want to eat, not 60 min. Right, got ya. Called back at 5:30 (you get the drift). It took us 19 minutes to drive to the restaurant after putting our name in and when we got there we were told it would be a 2 hour wait. Um, what? We tried to explain that we had \"called ahead\" as instructed but we're just told that lots of walk-in's occurred in between us calling and our arrival. There didn't even appear to be that many people waiting. We couldn't stay because, let's face it, a 2 1/2 year old isn't going to calmly wait until 8pm eat and I was turned off by the whole experience. Just a very strange encounter from start to finish."}
{"text":"Love the patio, beautiful view, great for kids, friendly service, trendy, and a great menu!  The neighborhood is really nice and upscale.  Perfect spot at sunset for date night.  The bruschetta, cocktails, Rueben, pizza, lasagna and salads are all great!  The white fish was disappointing, portion of fish was minimal, no sides and  too much onion on the top.  The outdoor seating is limited.  All and all a great place for family dinner, date night or girls night out!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, cocktails great, service great- food NOT so great -worst hummus I've ever had- how hard is it to screw up hummus?..sad because this place is perfect except for the food. We'd probably go to this place everyday if it weren't for the lousy food.. Their sister cafe MOJO- has much better food!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, the atmosphere is laid back  and inviting, the views are gorgeous, pizza is delish BUT the service ruins it."}
{"text":"The waitress was great! The space was interesting!  The food was practicably inedible. Probably the worst pizza I've had in ages and the Pastas for the most part don't have a red sauce.  The one we had  we had between the two of us could barely make a dent in it.  I would say this would be a alternative to taking kids to Micky D's.  the pricing structure doesn't make sense.  Cheap pastas, expensive beers, wines and salads?  Who am I to say?  Try it.  Good luck."}
{"text":"One star because we walked in at 5pm on a Saturday and they said they couldn't take any walk ins for another 2 hours!! I even called ahead of time to ask if they took walk ins and they said yes. There was no one else waiting! They said that the reservations just filled up all of their tables for the next 2 hours. Then why tell people that you take walk ins. It is so frustrating, really."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family.  Great food and if you sit on the patio there's a grassy area for the younger kids to run around."}
{"text":"Happy hour ends at 5:30, so you had better come early! There was no patio seating available on the Thursday night that we went, so we ate inside with a view of the patio, which is really not the same. Make a reservation and get a patio table. The views of the beautiful greens are worth it. Thor was our server, and he did a great job of keeping up with four ladies' drinks and snack orders. The meat and cheese plate was enormous, far too large for its serving platter. The $4 Olive appetizer on happy hour was not worth it, although the olives seemed  home cured.  Chips and salsa was moderately okay, with thick Mexico stuff chips, and  pureed salsa with little flavor. The guacamole was the Saving Grace but $10 for chips and guac  at happy hour seems like a lot.  If I were not gf I would have tried bruschetta or pizza, both looked great. The wings were prepared well done as requested, but lackluster in flavor. At $7 a glass, happy hour wine is not a super deal. Check out pita jungles specials, management!  I think there is lots of opportunity for improvement."}
{"text":"This was an amazing place to relax, eat and drink. We have always had an awesome time here. Our friends and our family let our children play in the nice grass areas and do gymnastics while we watch them play. We have done this for years. We have also met other families at the restaurant who do the same with their children. This is a large reason why families frequent the restaurant!  Recently, they hired a \"security guard\" who is obviously just a self proclaimed \"guard\" young kid eager to yell at younger children and their parents out of concerns of small children falling in their pond area.  The so called \"security guard\" walks around in his pink shirt yelling at the children who are playing in the grass. It was way out of control as we saw him run out of the restaurant making sure to catch every child who was playing in the grass. It was so disturbing to see this man run at everyone's kids as if he were catching criminals. My daughter is 11 years old and is well behaved. She is not going to fall into a pond or throw a ball at someone's head, as the restaurant claims is the problem with children in their grass area. We asked to speak with the manager, Nate, who didn't come out. Instead we had a 20 year old young girl employee who came out as we told her we didn't like how the fake security guard yelled at our kids 8 times for doing cartwheels in the grass. She basically told us she didn't care if we came back to her restaurant or not. I'm sure the 85 year old snowbirds complaining about kids will be happy to know they took away a lot of loyal customers because of their dislike of children playing near them. As I will tell everyone I know at our Scottsdale school and everywhere we frequent about the restaurant's recent change to their child policy. Isabella's will lose a lot of loyal customers when they see this man running out to yell at their children as well as the parents. The so called \"security guard\" takes pride in yelling at children, and I'm sure parents in North Scottsdale will not be pleased with their recent change in child policy.  This makes for an uncomfortable and stressful environment while trying to enjoy a once peaceful environment.  Also, let your fake security guard know that before yelling at well behaved children who are doing cartwheels of customers paying $250-$500 for lunch or dinner, he needs to remove the empty disgusting alcohol bottles laying around in your parking lot.  Picture attached."}
{"text":"Great bar and beautiful setting.  Great views of the golf course.  Mediocre Italian food at higher-than-mediocre prices (I think you pay a premium for the setting).  Service is slow.  My advice... Go for drinks and apps at the bar but find another place for dinner."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  Food is decent.  A few suggestions...  Not like they will listen being tied to Grayhawk Golf Club...  Lol.  The prices are too high for the quality of food period!!!  Re-work that hummus recipe.  Some of the worst I've had.  Most of the food is ok, but nothing wows you.  The staff is really nice and the table service has been good.  The bar staff is always super nice.  It's really down to food and pricing.... We would frequent more often if those two were fixed..."}
{"text":"We have watched this place being built for awhile, as we live very close by, and were excited about a new casual dining option.  Pro's:   * Very nice building and location, with great views of the course. * Plenty of parking. (I'm really stretching to find at least 2 nice things to say)  Con's:  * The décor is really lacking direction, is it Mexican? is it new American? really kind of leaves one wondering what the place is. Felt like part frat bar, part sports bar, part Hooters, part something else but cant put my finger on it.  * The service needs to improve, very slow and very casual, 2 items we asked for never arrived.  * The Food is ok, but very institutional looking/tasting.  * Very loud inside.  * Now the biggest issues.... This place is packed with the Scottsdale yuppies and their brat like little ones. One table had 3 couples, all with I think 2-3 kids. The parents let the kids run around screaming and banging into tables running inside and out. Parents just ignored it. Many other diners were also looking at this group with disbelief. The manager really should have asked them to control these brats.  * Over all, not a place we would return to.  Again, sad to see another local place up here that is being rated so poorly."}
{"text":"The setting of the restaurant is absolutely stunning. Isabella's Kitchen is a large yellow building overlooking one of the Grayhawk golf courses.  I went there mid-afternoon as a solo diner and sat the bar. The server, whose name I forgot was very warm and welcoming. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich which came served on a hoagie roll and a side salad. For ten dollars I expected to be wowed but unfortunately wasn't. The balsamic vinaigrette for the salad was not very good and the chicken was very dry and lacking flavor.  I understand how Isabella's can appeal to golfers who are looking for a restaurant with a nice ambiance to grab a bite to eat. However, my first impression was lackluster in terms of the food.  From its looks, the restaurant must have cost a fortune to build. I feel as though the menu needs a little work in terms of improving its selection and quality if the restaurant is to enjoy long term success."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying \"Wow!\", walking up to the restaurant and the patio is amazing with a Christmas tree 12 ft tall made of wine bottles. Walking into the restaurant the Bar over looks the golf course and views of the valley.   The beverages were ice cold, and finger food were delicious. I did not dine from main menu as was with Party, will definitely going back to try again."}
{"text":"Great menu - came here on a Friday afternoon with 2 other families and I love the grassy area where the kids can play (and confined) and yet the parents can also enjoy conversation and delicious drinks! The food menu was delicious, their colognes was out of this world. My kids inhaled their pasta dishes as well! The staff was super friendly and very accommodating (considering we didn't have reservations on a Friday afternoon). I would highly recommend Isabella's kitchen and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a beautiful view!! Hosts were very friendly, we went to the bar for a glass of wine while waiting for our table. The food was good, I wasn't too crazy about the lasagna (reminded me of hamburger helper) but the prosciutto pizza was delicious! I've been looking for a restaurant like this where you can truly enjoy the Arizona sunset and this is it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. Service was attentive and it was good for a large group. All of the good was reasonable. Pretty normal fare but I thought the desserts were great. Would recommend the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Beautiful back patio overlooking the golf course but food is mediocre at best. Some decent appetizers but over priced for quality. Try the bruchetta."}
{"text":"Service was just ok. The waitress was extremely nice, but tried to convince me the white glass of wine she brought out was the Cabernet I ordered She said she thought it was red too, but this particular one was white. After trying to convince me that Cabernet was actually white, my husband spoke to the bartender and got it resolved. Then I ordered my food no butter (I had steak and veggies and very clearly asked them to use olive oil instead of butter) after I had eaten 1-2 bites she came out and  asked if the kitchen used butter? She thought she told them no butter. It was hard for me to tell but after being home for 3 hours I now know they used butter. We love this place - the location is amazing and with small children it's one of my favorites, but experiences like this are not fun and will make me think twice about visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love to come here for lunch/dinner to get their grapefruit Vojito, delicious salads and manicotti. Our fantastic server once recommended that we try the manicotti with vegetables and meat sauce (instead of having to choose) and it was so good! The vegetables are cooked to perfection with the right amount of crunch to them. Their shallot house dressing is my favorite. My husband and I love this place so much that we had our wedding here. It was the perfect combination of simple and breathtaking. The service by the staff was top notch. I felt so spoiled the entire night and were very easy to work with. I was really nervous about the tasty dinners not being so tasty when cooked on a large scale, but it tasted exactly the same. For weeks my family and friends have been telling me how our wedding had the best food of any wedding they'd been to. The sunset views here are gorgeous. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dinner or place to hold an outdoor private party."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and good food. The wait is usually long with open tables. I think they just need to staff better. But I really like this place. Good to take friends and enjoy a glass of wine while watching the sunset over the golf course"}
{"text":"A brand new place in Scottsdale. I enjoyed coming here in my marathon tour of the city on a Saturday night, there was great live country music outside. Really cute place with good service, just came for drinks not for the food. LOVE all the beautiful rocking chair seating at the patio tables, though I don't know how long they will last for. Great place to bring a date for the ambiance, and not too pricey.  There's also another pretty little patio nook area to get away to, but one of the lights was out so it was too dark. Turns out it was some famous stargazing night (overcast unfortunately) so maybe they actually made it dark on purpose."}
{"text":"i came here my first night in arizona to eat some dinner with my bf and his mom. there are gluten free options but they're all cross contaminated :o  i ordered the quinoa kale salad and it was massive. like a whole bag of kale i'd buy for the week all on one plate. it was pretty good but how could u screw up quinoa and kale?? i also ordered a Moscow mule which was great! it was not very sweet and i appreciated that.  we ordered some roasted Brussels sprouts for an appetizer, they were delicious! i love a roasted vegetable."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL views of the Grayhawk Talon golf course! Come at sunset if you can and enjoy the sunset over a cocktail or beer/glass of wine. Good service and people watching scene. Haven't eaten here but food looks decent!"}
{"text":"This review is really a 2.5 so take it as it is. This was a recommendation and unfortunately, wasn't really what we were looking for as a whole.  The view on the golf course was beautiful and really enjoyed the sunset here. It's very casual, great service, and food comes out fast. Cocktails were pretty good too. Overall, if you are just coming for drinks and a view then it's a-ok (as Yelp would say).   We were there on Sat evening and by the end, I thought I was at Chuck E Cheese. Tons of kids everywhere - and running around like maniacs (in the dining area, rolling around on the golf course, and just all over the place). Kids are fine, but I just wasn't expecting that at all. I blame my friend - LOL. Anyway, it was bearable, but then the food came. The best part of the meal was the appetizer - prosciutto/fig bruschetta - that was actually delicious. Our main meal was the fusilli bolognese (just meh - could have been hamburger helper out of a box) and the meat lovers pizza (I've had great pizza and this doesn't even come close).   It's unfortunate as I was expecting a high end meal given the location, scenery, etc. Oh well..."}
{"text":"My friend recently celebrated her birthday here with a group of 20. It's located right on the Grawhawk Country Club. Fair is more like it then A-OK.  Just wasn't that impressed with the food and service. I ordered the kale salad and for a few dollars you can add chicken,which I did. My salad came out minus the chicken. Where's the chicken? They took it back and returned with alas the chicken which was ice cold. I sent it back, again- how about we start over with a fresh salad? Gee?  Now I rarely, rarely send stuff back!! By this time everyone else was done eating and waiting for their checks. I ended up asking to take mine home which I ate later and really didn't like it.Maybe I need to go back and try something else, but the atmosphere and everything, just didn't have a good vibe."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The ambiance is fantastic. It's a golf course view, but that also means you get to see great herons And coyotes hanging out. Lots of mountains in the background.  Love the housemade pasta - I usually go for the lasagna, but went for the shrimp fettuccini and really enjoyed the nice spice kick, no cream or cheese - perfect balance. My husband went for the housemade sausage sandwich and he proclaimed that it's as good as it gets here! Roasted sweet peppers, what more can be said?  The wine list includes Grenache - a perfect red, and Peroni beer on tap.  Are we talking heaven here, or what?  The final touch is the sour cherry jam with the ricotta zeppoli. Even my Italian born mother would approve. It's been three years I've been going here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered their french onion soup and brussels sprouts appetizer. The soup was a bit on the salty side but the brussels sprouts was amazing. My husband had their beets salad which he loved. I took away a star because the service was slow. We were there on Saturday for lunch and it was not crowed, but it took painfully long to get our order in and getting our check. No one came by to refill our drinks either. I'd only go here again if I was already there for golf or to get takeouts, otherwise I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"Have come here a number of times for happy hour. Has a good fun upbeat diverse crowd. Friendly helpful bartenders and staff. Food is tasty and drinks are strong. Has incredible views of the valley and it is situated right on the golf course so in the summertime it's actually a good 10 degrees cooler than the surrounding area. If you are up in the DC Ranch area definitely come and check this place out. Sometimes parking can get a little crowded."}
{"text":"Birthday celebration with my best friend. Beautiful atmosphere but service was lack there of. I walked in, they were nice they seated us quickly. To start off we ordered the calamari dish, it was mediocre. Then we ordered the open faced turkey sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich which was ok. Or waitress made us feel rushed from the start of our meal. Then, we received  our bill and as we were leaving I say, \"good bye, thank you so much!\" And she looks at me and looks back down and laughs without recognition. I will never return. Just because I'm 19, I'm still a cash paying patrons. Don't let the views and presentation fool you."}
{"text":"First time I went I loved it and was really impressed- each time I have gone back its gotten worse and it bums me out! The only thing that is still amazing is the Bella's Mac and cheese!  It has such a great view and atmosphere, especially when the weather cools off and you can sit on the patio. They have live music on Sundays which is nice too.   To sum it up- it's a place to go hang out for some wine but its hit or miss with the food and service."}
{"text":"I truly love this place, from beautiful views to lovely out door space. The bartender Miranda is amazing!  She always remembers your favorite drink to favorite meal (even offers her favorites to help us on our indecisive days). It's a lovely setting and I'll be going back on the regular. Will always recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Isabella's about once a month or so.  The gorgeous atmosphere on the patio makes it a perfect outdoor evening dinner spot, especially in the fall/winter when the fire pit is lit-very pretty. We always start with a bottle of red wine, the Salt & Pepper Shrimp and have worked our way down the entire pasta menu. My new favorite dish is the Veggie Campenelle-outstanding and light. I highly recommend trying this place. I can't see why anyone would be disappointed."}
{"text":"This the perfect post-hike lunch. We had pizzas and creme brûlée! The outdoor seating is very nice. Great for photos. The pizza was delicious as was dessert. The service was also prompt and nice."}
{"text":"Great dinner and drinks with friends! I had two margaritas, side salad with shallot vignette, and meant lasagna with white sauce!"}
