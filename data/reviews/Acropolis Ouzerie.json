{"text":"Was a very good place but it is now closed. It's a shame. Have not seen any notice about if it was moved or just plain closed."}
{"text":"My first thought of this restaurant is that it looked like Greece. Complete with open windows to the outside, the ambiance here made the meal feel more authentic to the culture. I absolutely loved the decor! It's also conveniently located near McGill on Sherbrooke and Parc.  When I went on a Friday around 12:30, it wasn't crowded. The service was great! The lady promptly filled our water pitchers as we ran low and took our orders right away. We didn't have to wait long for our food either. The fried calamari (C$11) was pretty decent at the start and was served with a tomato-based sauce, but as it got cold, the unnecessarily large amount of oil became more prominent. The gyro pita (C$6) was absolutely delicious though! Portions are sized generously. My friends and I all left extremely stuffed!  I recommend the gyro. Can't go wrong with that! Would definitely come here again. They take cash and card."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant multiple times. The food is wonderful and if you chat up the owner and waitress they can be quite friendly and have great stories too!  The first time we went there was only another seated table in the restaurant, which surprised us. But the next time we were there it was completely packed! The food is great, and speak to the owner and he will make you absolutely anything you desire. My sister asked for a caesar chicken salad, which was not on the menu and it was prepared delightfully no questions asked. I've order the spanikopita meal which was delicious, the mousaka is the best I've ever had, and their tzaziki is flavorful and goes wonderful with their grilled bread they give you. The only meal I wasn't too crazy about was the vegetarian pita, which would have been much better if there wasn't SO MUCH feta. All meals come with rice, potatoes, and salad. They are quite large and there is always left overs to take home.  Overall this place is quite authentic and a small family business which is nice to support. It's much much better than the chain greek restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This Greek restaurant could not look any more Greek. The entire restaurant looks like the Island of Santorini, Greece. The outside and inside is blue and white. The inside has beautiful pictures of Greece, blue and white decorated walls, pretty lights, bouzouki on the wall and much more- just beautiful!   The menu is handwritten and the writing was not easy to read. The menu consists of appetizers, soups, salads, meat and seafood entrée options and sides. The prices are reasonable, but not for the quality and quantity that you receive. The portions are okay, and the food is good but not great- it's okay. My calamari was too oily, the chicken souvlaki was a bit dry, the rice was a tad bit bland, and the potatoes were slightly burnt. Also, my salad was on the plain and dry side as well. My hubs had the gyros and really liked it though. However, the desserts are really good and reasonably priced. The baklava has honey oozing all over it, and the rice pudding with cinnamon was delicious!  The staff is friendly and the service is okay too.  Overall, I've had better and this place did not impress me."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, very authentically decorated. The Greek salad had a delicious fresh made dressing. Much better choice than a food chain. The waiter/owner was a very sweet man."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.  It was decent but I've had much better.  The Fried Calamari was so greasy and underseasoned.  It was really bad.  We did enjoy the Saganaki and the Sangria."}
{"text":"Solid Greek place- good size dishes, calamari was tender and there are smaller dishes for the kids."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food very authentic, good for a lunch or dinner. Souvlaki is good. The potato's and rice are a bit too much sides. Good Tsatziki as a starter. Use the leftover for your main course. Very Greek style interior."}
{"text":"Having once lived in Astoria, Queens (NY) which has fantastic Greek food, I'm mostly disappointed when I try out Greek cuisine in other places.  I was VERY happy with my meal here.  My spouse and I had tzatziki, spanokopita (as an appetizer), a plate of warmed grape leaves, and a Greek salad.  All of it was DELICIOUS.  The service was good and very quick.  The atmosphere is perfect and exceptionally clean.  Prices are very slightly higher than what I am used to, but I found that true of most of Montreal.  So it can't really be held against them.  I highly recommend this place.  It's a gem."}
{"text":"Good Greek food, with several vegetarian options. While it was a little expensive, I did receive large portions. The atmosphere was nice and so was the service."}
{"text":"Food is nothing special, no incentive to come back. The service was fine.... because we were the only guests there."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. Chose the moussaka and an espresso. The moussaka was incredible! The owner, Dmitri, is very friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"I had a chicken gyro from this place and it was probably the worst gyro I've ever had. The chicken and the bread was burnt and the whole thing was covered in tzatziki sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love tzaziki but you should also be able to taste the chicken, tomatoes and onions as well. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice traditional Greek restaurant Nice family Tsaziki Greek salad Baklava Asked for additional olive oil, average taste nothing special"}
{"text":"This restaurant always exceeds.  It is like a welcome from an old friend. Whenever in Montreal the Ouzerie is a must visit. Over the past weekend we dined twice here. Given the number of great restaurants in Montreal this is a true compliment given to the owners and staff. The calamari, for us, is a standard from which we always start. The cocktail sauce served with the fried calamari is a tomato based sauce with an undertone of sweetness. It's great. Other dishes sampled included the house special moussaka, gyro platter, spanakopita, Greek salad and their famous and to die for tzatziki. This comes complimentary with grilled bread that has been rubbed with garlic and brushed with olive oil. It is served as an appetizer. All in all we have always looked forward to dinning here and look forward to many more future meals here."}
{"text":"Cute little Greek restaurant with lots of funky ambience. When we wandered in here for lunch we were the only patrons in the restaurant, but we found the food to be delicious. To begin your meal, you are offered a complimentary plate of toasted bread covered in olive oil along with a generous portion of tzatziki. I had the Greek salad, which was delicious served with several whole tomato slices and a generous amount of olives. My friend enjoyed the mousakka, which is their speciality. Our waiter, who I assume was the owner as well, was friendly and prompt. He didn't seem to speak French, however and spoke to us only in English. Prices are reasonable with most entrees in the $15 to $20 range."}
{"text":"I ate there on a sunny day this week, and my-oh-my is the restaurant beautiful ! My friend said she felt like she was in Greece. I don't know about night, but I think this place looks a lot better in the daytime.   The waiter/owner really loved to talk to us. From the moment we walked in, he would ask us about our day, where we're from, so on. And when we went up to pay, instead of taking our bills right away, he talked to us for what seemed like half an hour. I can see that he is really attentive to the satisfaction of his customers. He even gave us coffee with some alcohol (don't know the name) for free because some customers gave in a wrong order.   I ordered the dolmades and spanokapita. Very good. There was an abundant amount of tzaziki on the table. Tzaziki always makes me happy ! It was my friend's first time having Greek food and she said she'd love to bring her brother next time.   The only con (the reason I gave a 4) is that they don't have cheaper prices for lunch. Main meals are priced between $14-25 for lunch. At least they give large portions."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I think it was owner that served us - we came in for a late lunch. Food was plentiful; appetizer sampler was yummy - everything very fresh. Gyros were good, cucumber sauce was great. Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Only the older male owner was in. He completely ruined a family graduation lunch and left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Was sexist, racist, rude, and outright obnoxious. Bad service, oily food, soggy and un-fresh salad, and overpriced in general as well. Insulted almost everyone in my family. Was seriously the worst restaurant experience of my life. Seriously avoid this place."}
{"text":"Certainly the best Greek food I've had outside Greece. Fresh ingredients, freshly prepared and about as unpretentious as it gets. Had good chats with the owner though he was a little grumpy at first!"}
{"text":"Taramosalata Fried calamari Chicken souvlaki platter Gyro platter Bottle of rosé  Good hearty Greek food, served in huge portions. You will not go hungry. The only negative is the fried calamari, which as another reviewer said, were greasy. The chef needs to learn to drain them after removing them from the fryer; until then order something else."}
{"text":"Came here with the old man last night for dinner after moving heavy stuff..way to work up an appetite! I had passed this place countless times but finally decided that on my very last night in Montreal, I was coming, no questions asked. The place is lovely. Lovely interior..like you're on a Greek island in the Aegean, full with statues, Greek bouzouki music, and Mediterranean feel. There is an upstairs area and the interior is quite roomy. We walked in and I was a little put off with how the woman who greeted us and showed us to our table didn't seem cheery or happy to be there. She kind of just looked at us and gestured towards our table. She did warm up to us as the evening went on though! So about the food, yeah, so...we ordered too much. Fried calamari for two..HUGE portion but very tasty! Also, stuffed grape leaves..melted in your mouth. Loved it. Portions are BIG, watch out! They give you A LOT of grilled bread! Ordered one of their wines, a sweet and pleasant Greek white wine. It is a bit pricey in general but I can tell that this is a family mom and pop business. It is important to support those, especially if they have good food!  All in all, a lovely and charming place. Very nice. I wish I had come sooner. If I come back to Montreal, I would try to come back!"}
{"text":"Decor: A step into is restaurant gives a vibe of Greece.  It has splashed of blue and white accenting the balconies and multilevels.  Definitely a nice feel.  I especially noticed that each place setting was graced with a different coloured plate, a very cute touch.  Food:  Appetizer: The Saganaki had a milder flavour than I have experienced at other places.  One interesting option that our server asked us was whether we wanted it glamed or unflamed.  We opted for the flamed.  The bread provided was toasted with olive oil on it and the tzatziki was absolutely amazing.  Main: Chicken & Pork Souvlaki. My wife enjoyed her meal immensely although she did have a preference to the chicken over the pork. The meal came with rice, potatoes, and salad.  She modestly passed on the potatoes to me, I enjoyed them noting that they were more a roasted potato than one with a tomato-y sauce. cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The rice was a hit for her. Moussaka: Having grown up on my mother's amazing moussaka recipe, I enjoy tasting other's interpretation of this disk. This recipe didn't fail to impress.  The flavours mixed well with one another and one of the most enjoyable parts was the bechamel topping. Definitely on my top 10 list. Both meals came with a greek salad which had a slice of feta cheese on top as a garnish. Excellent idea, allowing the customer to decide if they would like to crumble the cheese with their salad, eat it on it's own, or pass it off to someone who might like extra feta."}
