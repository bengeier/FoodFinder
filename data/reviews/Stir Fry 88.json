{"text":"Over all not so bad, I had lomein orange chicken and BBQ chicken. Not the best orange chicken ever but the BBQ chicken is on point. Very nice people, can't understand a word but not rude at all."}
{"text":"The sample was better than the food. We had orange chicken. It was not tasty and it was hard with no meat inside. The rice was old and hard too. We had courtesy cup of water. It was not clean, something was in it.  We are going to call this review   \"Don't let the samples fool u\"."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the customer service is great! The meat is fresh and organic (no MSG). It is my favorite place to go for Asian food."}
{"text":"Stir Fry 88 is about average for Chinese mall food, which is to say that even low expectations are unlikely to be satisfied.  Not much has changed  despite the relocation to the new (and very much improved) Great Northern Mall food court.  The fact that they consistently have the shortest (or no) line among all the food court establishments is probably both the reason you're there and a telltale sign of things to come.  

The food choices are familiar:  greasy lo mein noodles, soggy vegetables, fried rice, white rice, chicken with mushroom, chicken with broccoli, mango chicken, orange chicken, bourbon chicken, General Tso's chicken, spring rolls, etc.  Nothing really stood out, though the bourbon chicken was halfway decent.  The chicken with mushrooms was particularly bad, and you are probably better off with plain white rice  rather than the lo mein or fried rice options."}
{"text":"When the budget and stomach dictate fast-food Chinese, I listen! However, my experience at Stir Fry 88 was very disappointing today. I ordered a 2 item combo to go with Fried Rice, \"spicy\" Bourbon Chicken & General Tso's Chicken.  The rice was dry and the peas tasted as if they were incredibly stale and/or undercooked. The Spicy Bourbon Chicken was incredibly salty and not spicy at all. The General Tso's Chicken was the \"best\" out of any of the items, but still-- it was drenched in excessive amounts of sauce (I love General Tso's flavor but enough sauce is enough sauce... I prefer chicken dipped in sauce instead of sauce dipped in chicken).

If you have a craving for some chicken, soy sauce, rice and veggies at this food court, you are MUCH better off going to the Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I was there on Monday June 25 and all i ordered was rice and I sat down and went to eat when I realized I forgot to get soy sauce so I sent my friend to the counter and asked her to get some for me and she did and not only did they charge her 3 dollars for a half full styrofoam cup full of an unidentified red liquid that tasted metallic and gross I know this because I put a small amount on my rice and about 15-30 minutes later I got a really bad headache and my stomach started hurting really bad and as soon as I got home I started throwing up not only did they racially profile my friend  who's a Muslim American my wife got so worried she felt so bad afterwards and when I tried to call them about this issue it went straight to voicemail I always wondered why this place was never busy and lacked customers now I know why I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE NOR WILL I EVER EAT HERE EVER AGAIN YOU ARE A HORRIBLE RESTAURANT FUCK YOU"}
