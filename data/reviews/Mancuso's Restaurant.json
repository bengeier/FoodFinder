{"text":"I am not going to talk about the food in this review. The food is just fine. It is great quality, well prepared, and exactly what you expect from Italian American restaurant. What I do want to comment about is the service. You are walking into their home. Fran and/or Jimmy will greet you at the front desk. My server, David, recommended food items as if he were going to eat them himself. I knew it wasn't because they were going bad and the chef wanted to make sure they got moved. He did not steer me wrong in anyway shape or form. Conversation with Fran and Jimmy as I left felt like I was in their home, They had invited me for dinner, and we were having after dinner conversation. It was fabulous! I can only hope that if they ever travel to Washington DC that I will have the opportunity to host them at my house the way that they hosted me in theirs. Go for the food, but definitely go for the service!"}
{"text":"This is literally a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix.  It is in a shopping/entertainment complex  directly across from Talking Stick Arena. They have a decent HH, the plus is it's seven days a week !

The photos attached are selections from the HH menu, will definitely make this a regular visit. The risotto was prepared perfectly and veal meatballs were  delightful. Only reason for not providing five stars was the venue was a morgue, and manager, possibly owner never acknowledged? my presence."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing! Ambiance, food, service top notch. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here during a conference. Dining area feels very fancy and the prices are a little on the high side for lunch. Overall the food was good, but other restaurants in the area have been a bit better. I had the tortelloni. The pasta definitely seemed to be fresh but was overly lathered in cream sauce. Service was quick. Would still go back if I wanted pasta."}
{"text":"Last night we ordered the ribeye, which was delicious and the veal chop with mushroom sauce which was one of the best meals I've experienced downtown.   To top it off, Pi, the bartender, has concocted a Pumpkin Pie martini which was delectable.   A must have!"}
{"text":"Such a great meal and service! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. The lobster fra diavolo was amazing and the filet mignon couldn't not have been cooked more perfectly. Service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"The entire dining experience was delightful! We made reservations for a party of five and we're immediately seated when we arrived.  We ordered a wide variety of dishes and and they were all good.  The service was exceptional.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot! On business travel with a couple of colleagues and menu had enough variety for everyone's taste buds. Great service,  except for a minor tweaking of an order. Price comparable for the offerings. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. There was no one here but it took over an hour to get our meal. Then we asked for manager who challenged us about our ordering time said she could pull the ticket. No one was entire restaurant! My colleague ordered medium rare and it was well done-they took off, never had a manager so rude. No wonder it is empty restAurant ."}
{"text":"My wife and I remember the original site at the Bodega in Scottsdale years ago. Went here in downtown while visiting in Phoenix and were not disappointed. It's still family owned and operated. Excellent pasta and the soup was a potato vegetable and sausage soup. It was outstanding. I had the capellini bolognese and my wife had the small plate butternut squash ravioli . Both were outstanding. Service was very good too. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it a - 1. Horrible experience prior to concert at Talking Stick Arena. Sat at bar for dinner, which we were told was fine.
Ordered after waiting for menus close to  1/2 hr. That should have been our first clue.
I finally got the appetizer another 1 later, then when we begged to please send our dinners our, the waitress came back to tell us they were backed up and CANCELLED our order!!!!!! That was after sitting there 1  1/2 hrs AFTER we ordered.
No apologies were offered.
The owner was RUDE and told us she would help us write the review.
Shameful service.
Will NEVER EVER GO BACK.
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE . We never got dinner."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my fiancee. Nice Italy place but also serves French and American dishes. The server was quite talkative. Food was good. Please expect to see a full tray of real cake samples when you order dessert."}
{"text":"This is without question the go to Italian restaurant in Phoenix. I have been here several times a year for the past four years and it is consistently perfect.

The wine selection is exceptional, the food is great, and the staff is fully engaged to make sure you enjoy your experience.

My favorite dishes are the tortellini panna as a small plate and veal marsala, but you can't go wrong.

Ask to be seated in Aaron's section, a true professional."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place service was EXELLENT!
Everyone friendly was very tasty The food is amazing"}
{"text":"The Mancusos have been in the valley for decades and their food takes me back to Whitestone, NY where I would eat my grandmothers delicious homemade Italian food every Sunday. Mancusos has amazing pasta dishes, especially the Lobster Fra Diavolo, a Veal Chop to die for and honestly the best Ribeye on the planet! Yes, I said Ribeye! Apparently, they are the only restaurant in Arizona that serves Piedmontese Beef which is actually a better cut than Black Angus Prime (the beef every expensive steakhouse in this town serves). Another big difference is that my steak also came which Gorgonzola mashed potatoes and their vegetable of the day. With the money I saved not having to buy a veggie and a starch with my steak I ended my meal with one of their wonderful desserts and a cappuccino. This is seriously the nicest looking restaurant in downtown Phoenix. They have a spacious, beautifully appointed dining room and a hidden gem of a lounge with great signature cocktails and a killer happy hour every day of the week. They also have two completely private dining rooms so I know where I will be having my next holiday party. Honestly, you have to try this place the next time you are in downtown Phoenix. I promise that you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier that this restaurant opened up downtown! I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere and decor, very classy and current! The food is delicious! You MUST try the Stuffed Mushrooms! And every staff member that I came in contact with was beyond helpful, accommodating, kind and professional! I will be recommending Mancuso's to ALL of my friends!"}
{"text":"Tried this out last night for their AZ restaurant week special before the Mercury game.  We both had Shrimp & Scallop Scampi, it was delicious!  Had a salad that had figs and goat cheese (forgot the name), and desert was small piece of tiramisu and cannoli, my faves!  David was our server and he was great and very nice and helpful.  And I believe the manager also stopped during our dinner.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice for an authentic Italian restaurant downtown Phoenix. I likes the $5 meatball during happy hour that come in small plates so I can taste many choice of meatball and the sauces. My favorite is beef & pork meatball on marinara sauce and turkey meatball on pomodoro sauce. Best Italian in town!!"}
{"text":"We sat in lounge due to no reservations it was really nice, we had great service and delicious food.  We ordered Chicken Parmesan which was the best I have ever had so moist and yummy!  We also had the stuffed mushrooms which were great also which had an Alfredo sauce we dipped bread into afterwards so good.  The dessert tray looked very good but we were to full."}
{"text":"In town for a conference.   My wife picked this place dinner on our first free night. Unbelievably awesome!  From start to finish, best food ever. 

She had lasagna. I had chicken piccata.

Everything was just perfect!!!  I/we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We took clients for dinner last night. Although we had a reservation for eight, we added 3 more to the group last minute, which worried me as host. To my relief, the staff quickly and graciously came up with seating for all. Sevice was exquisite and detailed. Everyone enjoyed their selections. We shared appetizers around the table. I must mention the stuffed mushrooms in a succulent sauce. Personally, I started with a caesar salad. They make their dressing and it is loaded with fresh parmesan. had a very tender chicken marsala. The sauce was delicious. It came with a tasty risotta. The dessert tray was impressive, too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pricey. Delicious lasagna. Decent, I wasn't overly impressed with the turkey meatballs. Nice atmosphere. Good espresso martini. Happy Hour is the time to go! Try it all."}
{"text":"They made me puke, because the waitress did not listen to my dietary needs, and the dish supposedly only had a little bit of the offending ingredient. (And no, the entree was not comped). I do NOT like throwing up, especially out at a nice date restaurant, and now will feel a bit off for the rest of the night from eating that.

Pros, or why I left more than one star: 

Fantastic Caprese salad. There aren't a lot of bad Caprese salads out there, but theirs is especially outstanding.

Attentive waitstaff. The even split our appetizer, the aforementioned Caprese salad, onto two plates so we didn't have to reach over the table.

Cappuccino was above average.

They gave good phone directions.

But, if you have a food sensitivity, and you tell them, it might not sink in."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...
That's about the best I can say about Mancuso's. 
I asked to fave a taste of a wine they listed by the glass and was told \"it's a light red cab, not much else to it\". I asked if the tomatoes were looking good and was told \"yes\" they are great, so I ordered a Caprese salad. It was ok at best, with the tomato being a poor winter fruit with no taste. 
Ordered the Bolognese with linguine. First it was brought out 3 minutes after ordering and I hadn't come close to eating my salad so the waiter offers to bring it out later. The 5 minutes it sat under a warming lamp destroyed any good aspects 

Find another restaurant..."}
{"text":"I have to say I had high hopes for this restaurant... but was a little  disappointed 

Starters --- Any  great Italian place has to have good bread ... the bread was like the frozen garlic bread you get at your local grocery store.. if you want  return customers --rule number one - have great bread...

My main dish was linguine and clams sauce which was ok a bit too salty but just ok... the best part of the dinner was the wine... they have a great wine selection so we drank great wine which sorry to say help with the food..."}
{"text":"***Please Pass On This Place. You Will Thank Me. Over Priced & Small Portions***

This review is a MUST read. I scheduled a Postmates order that went wrong. I called the restaurant and Fran, the owner, was very adversarial saying it is a Postmates issue. I reminded her that she, herself, signed up for Postmates. I actually called her out of courtesy to let her know how her menu was being listed online in case she encountered other issues from upset customers. She was clearly not aware. She said Uber Eats and Postmates are the bulk of their business. Her adversarial attitude sure didn't seem like it. Nonetheless, Postmates refunded us and I knew they would. This place is way over priced given the portion sizes. They are family owned which makes it very difficult given other downtown competition. That being said, if Fran is going to continue to address issues the way she addressed ours, I see their family business coming to a close quickly. Fran did say she would call Postmates, however she didn't do that for me and continued to be argumentative. I do see on Yelp there are very positive reviews, however I believe it is important to assess owner and staff attitudes and if they actually value their customer's business. We will not recommend this place. Just wanted to share our experience. Way overpriced and a hassle. Fran may have been having a bad day and I hope she re-assesses her behavior."}
{"text":"Nice dinner during Happy Hour. David's service was great!

I enjoyed the Blue Point oysters and then meatballs in marinara sauce paired up with the daily risotto. 

I will return.

{"text":"We went there yesterday with my colleagues from Fiserv Forum 2016 event ... It's located on the 2rd floor... A little bit hidden...

We were glad we went there. The food and the service were excellent! Pinot Grigio was great and I ordered lobster tail, which was very nicely prepared and delicious!

Nice vibe... Was very busy... 

I highly recommend to visit."}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown. First date night place, or great martini. $7 at happy hour. Will be coming back soon.
Thank you for the great meal."}
{"text":"Ok im not a fan, all of have to say is that i was sat at the bar and waited patiently for 30 mins and didnt get my order or not even water, it was busy but not that many people at the bar, as soon as i got up the bartender quietly ask \"sir i will be right with you\" and i just walked away and he thought i didnt hear him and stated \"leave then!\" well i did! Maybe the restaurant has good food but unfortunately i didnt get to try it. Oh well. Went to a burger place and it was full and was eating in 15 min, customer service is the key here! Thats all i have to say."}
{"text":"This is great Italian American food! Porkchop Milanese with fabulous risotto.  And I discovered a lovely Pinot Noir from California! Who would've thought.  Most importantly my server and the two housts were so hospitable I felt that I was dining in their home."}
{"text":"Incredible food!
We actually first discovered this establishment on UBER EATS and fell in love. We had a date night at the location and were pleasantly greeted with exceptional service, beautiful presentation, and will always go back! Do yourself a favor and visit MANCUSOS!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal last a steak that melted in your mouth, shrimp cocktail that was divine, great salad and service a true pleasure."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Service is always superb! Everything on the menu is delicious, super fresh and above expectations!! Best appetizers include the crispy and amazing Calamari, the delightful crab stack giving you a soft punch with the wasabi, and brushettas!! As for entrees, the Salmon is always a win, the Chicken salad and Chicken Piccata are also a great pick!! Dessert is always a tough pick they will bring a large tray of goodies all rich and heavenly on their own!!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday night around 8:30 PM, promptly seated and ordered a glass of wine and a beer for me. We then ordered the calamari and wedge salad, the calamari was perfect light,crispy and presented on a long rectangular plate to show off the dish. Wedge salad had a fantastic blue cheese dressing, artichoke hearts hidden through out the plate, simply divine. Now on to the pasta, as an old grumpy Italian chef I usually leave Italian restaurants knowing I could do better at my place or at home. WOW I was wrong I ordered the linguine with white wine butter sauce and clams, absolutely to die for. My wife's plate had perfectly cooked shrimp and scallops over linguine. The timing on great scallops and bad scallops is literally seconds and they nailed it. For dessert we had the best Tiramisu of our lives. Our server was Ted who was fantastic, thank you for a great night out!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Not the best steak and not the worst. For the price, I would go somewhere else if you're looking for steak. The service however, was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. We've been very lucky to be served by David, artistically presenting and knowledgeably giving the hints of wine selection. In general - it's a marvel of the Phoenix cuisine. Sincerely yours, www.californiaway.org."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on business and a group of us went her for Dinner.  I was going to get the pasta but the waitress convinced me of getting the special which was Halibut. The fish was OK but about 30 min after consuming the fish something didn't feel right at all.  Not to be too graphic but I got violently ill.  Never been so sick in all my life.  I had a flight the next evening which I decided to gamble on.  I made it to the airport and then started to feel sick again. the next thing I remember are three paramedics standing over me as I passed out due to hydration.  I missed three days of work, got sick on the plane, got sick in the uber car,  and still haven't eaten seafood.  I believe the fish was fresh, but I'm pretty convinced something happened in the kitchen during the preparation of the fish.  The owner has NOT taken any responsibility what so ever so I decided to write this review."}
{"text":"Our server, David, was very animated - but did offer some great suggestions.  We shared the veal meatballs with creamy risotto (based on other Yelp comments) and it was fabulous.  My hubby had the crusted lambchops and he really liked them - I had the veal chop and it too was very good.  All dishes came out hot, which is always a pleasant surprise.  We shared a bottle of wine and creme brulee for desert.  Wine was one of the lowest priced available at it was decent and the creme brulee tasted like creme brulee.  Will consider coming back, but only occasionally - total bill w tax & tip exceeded $200, which is way over our budget."}
{"text":"First time visit. Service wonderful. Atmosphere wonderful. Food mediocre. Steak undercooked, fish overcooked, risotto bland and pasty.  Brushetta tasty, but served on stale bread."}
{"text":"I love restaurant week just to try new restaurants and this one did not disappoint. But I am surprised that it was not busier for a Thursday night. Enjoyed the mixed green salad with mustard vinagrette. The garlic bread to taste was good especially the Texas toast garlic bread. I had the shrimp and scallop scampi. I think I died and went to Italian heaven. Friend had the filet mignon. You could cut it with a butter knife. The Gorgonzola mashed potatoes were lift and airy and addictive. Dessert consisted of cheese cake with a strawberry drizzle. I could not finish it so I get to enjoy it later. Service was awesome and highly recommend the trip downtown to go there. They validate for parking so that made it better."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  Everything is really good.  I go for the lasagna, meatballs and Lamb. Pretty good Happy Hour.  Great downtown location near the arena and Diamonds stadium.  Near Cityscape and convention center.  Nice ambiance as well."}
{"text":"I do not know how steaks are in Arizona since I am from California, but wow, worst filet mignon I have ever had. The steak was dry and absolutely zero flavor. I have never made a comment about food and have it sent back, but I guess there is a first time for everything. Oh, for dessert we had ice cream and the ice cream was frost bitten..... I mean I understand if this was Olive Garden but not."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!! Waited 30 minutes at the bar for second round of drinks we ordered 
to go with our dinner. Nobody acknowledged our existence. Once we finally got an employee, he said he would take care of it. Only to return and state the bartender \"would prefer we just close out our tab because he was too busy.\" When we talked to the manager she simply walked away without any response. Paid our tab and left. Will not be back ever!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour shortly after they opened and had a great experience.  I thoroughly enjoyed the velvet kiss martini - $7 during happy hour and like dessert in a glass! 

I came back the following week for a business lunch and really enjoyed my experience then as well...great service, great atmosphere and great food too!  We shared the butternut squash ravioli to start and I enjoyed the Mediterranean salad for my entree...fresh, flavorful and filling!"}
{"text":"Food was very good! Came out hot and fresh! 
The fruta dimare lobster was done perfect. The flavors jumped out after every bite. 
Love the decor it's done very well and beautiful place. The ambience was a little to quite for us, not much people watching but that being said I think this place is awesome and great place to sweep your love off her feet. Well done!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!

A group of 10 of us were looking for somewhere we could go on a Friday night where we wouldn't have to wait an hour and we ended up here. The restaurant is very nice on the inside and the patio, which is where we sat. When we came, they had a large enough table set up for us and the ambiance was very welcoming and gave you a small taste of Italy.

We started with the calamari and it was delicious! Their marinara sauce seems homemade and it paired very well with the calamari and the bread they brought to the table. The bread had some kind of seasoning on it that was delicious and it was cooked to perfection with a hard crust and soft inside.

We ordered a wide range of food from steak to pasta, salmon, vegetarian dish, etc. No one had any complaints. The food came out in good timing. They had a nice wine selection and the server was quite knowledgeable about the wines and the food. Although no one purchased any, their desserts looked wonderful! They ranged from cheesecake, creme brulee, cake, etc.

I would definitely return to this place. They are a tad pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Balls. Yes . I am writing a review that starts off all about Balls. Yes. Balls. Mancuso's is located in the downtown part of Phoenix near Chase Field and The Talking Stick Arena. You may have to look a little to find it within the enclave of other building fronts of the Collier Building , but you will and when you do, it will be worth it.  Now, despite this review starting off about Balls, the MEATBALL, type of balls,  mind you! Mancuso's is a very classy , intimate Italian place. Down home authentic Italian. But let's get back to the Balls. In the BallRoom the most amazing meatballs are made: succulent , amazing and so yummy that you can't just have one. They are on Mancuso's Happy Hour from 4-7pm and I highly recommend you sample as many as you can prior to moving into the dining room later for dinner .. but maybe you just want to fill up on these amazing Ball Room Balls. Of course you may be stuffed if you do! For $5 you get two BIG balls made of Veal,Beef & Pork, Turkey or add a few bucks and get a special Bacon Wrapped Shrimp Ball(s). Then, add a choice of sauce : Marinara ; Arrabbiata; Alfredo or Pesto. They are served with a generous serving of Parmesan / Garlic Toast.  Amazing for dipping up that sauce! IF you didn't want to leave this big ambient Ball Room , add a side of pasta or salad or veggies and quinoa for $4 ! The drink specials are also amazing : $7.50 Martinis / 1/2 priced Margs/ Wines by the Glass $3 off / Bottles of Beer $2 off and $5 Wells.. there is a great selection of mixology drinks and a great wine and beer list. The bartender , Pai, has been with the Mancuso family for a LONG time and even relocated from Bobby's in Scottsdale to this new location downtown. I loved that he could tell you the history of the family and how this location came to be. In fact, the Mancuso family has a pretty long and colorful history in the valley of over 35 plus years and the menus recipes are from Fran's ( one of the owners) mother Agnes' Mancuso and her family from Northern Italy! After we filled up on balls.. we moved into the dining room. Here we started with the Crab Lump Meat Stack a generous portion of fresh crab atop a stack of hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, greens, tomatoes and asparagus with a light dressing. I'm picky about crab being in Arizona and this was super fresh and great for sharing. My dinner entree was the Baked Meat Lasagna and although a tad heavy on the salt , it was a huge portion and like my Gram used to make! RIch, full of cheeses and meat! I couldn't finish it all.. errr maybe I was full of balls! Fran Mancuso oversees the dining , literally she walked around the night I dined here and checked on us; that gives a very homey touch! I was so impressed with Mancuso's and I'm so happy they are in the downtown arena, as I think a place such as this was needed. Great, authentic Italian is so hard to find and this is a special place!"}
{"text":"What a Fabulous time and experience. We had the ahi appetizer and it was amazing. Food was wonderful, the Decour beautiful, and all the help wonderful. We definitely will come back here. Thanks."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had the displeasure of meeting Ms. Fran Mancuso this evening.  I travel for business nearly every week and have rarely been treated with such disrespect and offense.  I ordered a salad, shrimp cocktail and a steak while talking on the phone.  After ordering, I asked that the bartender course it appropriately and to also that he not rush the steak.  When the steak was delivered, the prepared temperature was incorrect as I had ordered a MR and this was M/MW.  I asked that they correct it and they did fire a new.  The second steak was delivered 20 mins later and was prepared accurately.  However, no apology or acknowledgement of the situation was expressed.
When I inquired as to what was normally done when someone was provided a steak that was overdone, the bartender did not know how to respond.  He dated only that \"she will not buy you a desert..\".  I asked to speak to the manager, who happens to be one of the Mancuso's.  Fran came out to greet me in an aggravated state and did not greet me with kindness or apology.  She simply asked if I had ordered the steak while on the phone and then delayed it.  She interrupted me several times to say that it was my request of coursing that caused the steak to \"sit in the window\" and apparently become over cooked.  I protested briefly before she interrupted, asking if I wanted her to pay for my steak or my dinner.  I told her I wished for neither, to which she responded by literally throwing up her hand and saying she was \"busy\" before she walked away.  

I rarely give reviews, and regret this had to be so terribly poor.  As a traveler, I wish someone had warned me.  If not a local who knows someone owning or operating this restaurant, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Popped in for our anniversary looking to try something new, and they did not disappoint.  Mancuso's atmosphere has a little bit of everything for everyone.  You could show up in a suit n' dress, or you could show up in a hoodie and Nike's.  No one would really look out of place.  The décor is very old school steakhouse-ish with tall secluded booths with deep cushions, yet contemporary enough with its light fixtures and style of chairs on the dining floor.  The patio is very open with large sliding glass doors and an excellent view of the streets you're overlooking while still feeling secluded and tucked away on 3rd street.  Music makes you feel like you should be discussing something important.  We were talking about how much we hate work and that we'd hopefully not be super gassy later.  That's four years of romance folks.

Food was solid.  Both of us did the specials of the day, sipped on martini's and started off with their shrimp cocktail and cheese tortelloni.  The peas and walnuts in the tortelloni gave a nice texture while also adding to the richness of that buttery sauce.

The server, Lisa, surprised us with an anniversary desert complementary from the house.  Our cynical asses, being in the service industry, automatically wondered what's to stop someone from BSing a special occasion every time they go out.  I mean, I have a degenerate friend named Ricky that has a birthday every time he goes out.  And I partake in it with him.  Talk about scum.  Man.  I feel like I need to repent.  Wait.  Never mind, feelings came and gone.  Good tiramisu. 

Lisa also gave us her pen, just because we asked her where she had gotten it from.  Chefs like a good knife.  Models need quality animal ear filters.  Losers up in Scottsdale like a balanced golf club and experienced sexual harassment lawyers.  Servers like a good pen, what can we say.  Thanks Lisa.  You the real MVP.

We weren't that gassy!"}
{"text":"James, my server, awesome.  He is the only reason they didn't get one star or less (which isn't possible).  The food isn't bad, it actually is quite tasty, but working in many restaurants in my life, I have seen my fair share of kitchen vs server/guest where the almighty Back of House team is ALWAYS right.  They don't make mistakes and the guest doesn't know what they are talking about, blah, blah.  Well this is one of those situations.  Long story short, my steak was cooked a medium, edges burgeoning on medium well, when I ordered a medium-rare.  Apologizing, I asked them to remake it.  If I was at a lesser steakhouse, I probably would have let it go, but when you are dropping $40 on a steak; I didn't want leftovers.  None the less, we heard the line cooks exclaiming we are ridiculous and didn't know what we were talking about, etc. etc.  They returned a new steak barely north of 120 (rare with a small amount of heat).  Having a modicum of restaurant experience, I have seen this in the past; where Chef driven restaurants drive the guest experience and it ruin the whole experience; leaving the server twisting in the wind.  So I boxed up the steak, took it home and grilled up some fantastic medium rare steak sandwiches and enjoyed them with my wife.  As we were leaving, I noticed the portrait of the matriarch Mancuso hanging in the lobby with the placard of Executive Chef.  I then realized she was the fill in hostess, or was manning the front this night; regardless glared at us all night.  It all came together then.  I hope the restaurant takes this review to heart, not as a gripe, but an observation.  The restaurant was Kincaid's prior........"}
{"text":"Wines are not properly stored for service. Red wine being served at room temperature in an establishment such as this is pretty unacceptable. Wine was hot!  Food was good but really wanted a great glass of red wine with dinner and passed all together on it."}
{"text":"Such a good restaurant! We had the best waitress ever, Laurie A.! She went beyond and was super lovely. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went down for Sunday dinner. Had 3 pasta dishes and dessert. All were excellent ! Service as well was very good . Would recommend a visit if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"People, wake up! Downtown Phoenix is not as far away as you think it is! And if you're a foodie like me, you're missing out on some of the finest cuisine experiences if you stay in Scottsdale! This is one of those gems. I overheard someone asked me at lunch bragging about this new restaurant and I leaned over and said there's nothing new about this restaurant other than the tenant improvement! This is my queue so's the one you knew loved and adored from the Borgata in Scottsdale!! Maybe I'm a loyalist, put as a born and raise New Yorker we have loyalty for things we love in fact if our car Prechter moves an hour away we say oh no how terrible now we have to drive an hour to go see Dr. Johnny. Whether or not you've ever heard of Mancuso's before you have heard of it now. I am Italian and last summer I spent one month in Italy, The plate to eat at Mancuso's are Italian grandmother approved. They just come with a side dish of less cursing. We were hosting a business luncheon today not only were they extremely competitive with their pricing but their service was five star! From Teresa the manager to the waiters themselves this Alec can't restaurant is pure class and decadence. From 10 to 65 people this restaurant has it all in terms of event space. Book your spaces now because once the secret gets out it's all over!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Had the oysters, the arugula salad and for the main course the Veal Chop of the day, and the 10oz filet... both were killer. 

Julian was great and steered us in all the right directions."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great atmosphere and amazing service. Food was delicious. Beautiful modern yet classic setting. 

We came right before closing and they welcomed us and took great care of us. Many times when you go to a restaurant before closing you can tell they are ready for you to leave and try to rush you out. Not here! The owner talked to us and shared how the recipes were from her mother.

We ordered the layered eggplant and the veal meatballs, and they were amazing. We weren't looking for a big meal so it was nice they had smaller plates in addition to their entrees.

I would go back in a heartbeat and highly recommend. The restaurant has been in the PHX metro for 48 years and I can see why!"}
{"text":"In town for a few days and came by for drinks. The drinks and atmosphere were great. Then tried the balls and loved them. This is a place will definitely recommend and when back in Phoenix will make a point of enjoying again."}
{"text":"Quiet Sunday evening after a long work week. Sat in the bar area with Michael the bartender and he was super accommodating. Great menu, fantastic wine. I had the scallop scampi, colleagues had chicken piccata and the veal. Everything perfectly cooked. Really enjoyed ourselves here! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had the steak and shrimp for dinner. The steak melted in my mouth like butter. Barely needed to use the steak knife. The shrimp was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of this place.  It use to be another restaurant I liked that one too.  But I went to Mancuso's for happy hour I ordered the meatballs and risotto.  The meatballs had no texture to them they were bland and soggish (I know that's not a word) but the risotto was so delicious but he took it away when I re-ordered the lasagna.  OMG the lasagna was so so cheesy and great it was $8 and worth it.  I ordered a couple of drinks then walked to the Sun's game. I can't wait to go back yummy!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT RESTAURANT!!! My hubby and I got a night out on the town and made reservations here for dinner. The ambiance is romantic relaxing. Our waiter was knowledgeable and urged us to take our time & enjoy our appetizer and wine which he recommended a fabulous wine La creama ! Unfortunately I do not remember his real name as we quickly made friends with his great personality and found out his nick name \"el guedo\" and quickly started calling him by that. We will be back my pasta was phenomenal my hubby got steak and lobster that he is still dreaming about. We found our new date spot! We highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a first date. My husband and I met up with friends here and it is very romantic and good food. I got the Gnocchi with meatballs and my husband got Chicken Picada and both meals were very tasty. I think the Gnocchi and meatballs could have added a little more meatballs and a little less sauce, but it was really good how it was. The stuffed mushrooms were amazing. There is a lot of cheese on everything. The lighting is perfect, the music is light and romantic. The drinks are really good. My husband got a Italian margarita and it was super tasty. The bread they bring out at the beginning is warm and really flavorful. This is a really great place to eat."}
{"text":"Used to go to Mancuso's when they were at the Borgata in Scottsdale. Then I went to their location at Kierland. Thrilled to find out they are now in downtown Phoenix. Best Italian food ever. Went there last night for happy hour. Their meatballs and sauce are magical. Also had eggplant parm which was divine. Calamari great too. BUT the meatballs are soooo good. I could have eaten 100 of them. And their garlic bread is deelish. Everything on happy hour is so reasonably priced -  including drinks, wine and beer. Service was excellent and ambience was heavenly.
If anyone ever gives this place a bad review I would say that they are either insane or they think that Olive Garden is real Italian. 
I can't wait to go back and try the lasagna and of course more meatballs. Oh and eggplant too. the sauce is so light, fresh and simply amazing. The meatballs are melt in your mouth tender. I can rave about this place forever. Just go. You won't be disappointed. The food is simply magical."}
{"text":"Very good Italian dinner after baseball game at Chase Field. Close Jefferson St location, was surprisingly quite for a Saturday night, but don't let that fool you - food and service were on point. Started vanilla with a simple Caesar salad, but the \"small\" size was substantial and had good flavor! Hot, soft but crunchy fresh bread served was great. Vegetarian \"paella\" was excellent - rice was softer than a traditional serve on a seafood dish, but veggies were tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, service, drinks & very good food in large portions. We had the Crab Stack as an appetizer - very different & refreshing. Entrees: HUGE piece of meat lasagna, very good, and chicken parmigiana - well sautéed, good marinara sauce & perfect amount of mozzarella cheese. Substituted the penne with angel hair pasta with no problems. 
Had a great conversation with the owner/hostess after dinner. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I ate here through uber eats. This is a cool little spot. I ordered the sweet potatoes with maple butter, Mac n cheese and the turkey meatballs. It was all delicious and better than expected- with so little reviews or pictures to sway me into dining here. I wasn't a huge fan of their meatballs, and I'm not quite sure why. 

I ordered their Lobster fra diavolo. It was so good. I ate leftovers for two days. The sauce was delicious, their was plenty of seafood along with the linguini, and it was great quality. Their calamari is pretty excellent as well. I will say though, that I always get the Cesar salad (usually for the next days to go lunch) and the mac
N cheese with sweet potato mash 

Tonight, I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken.... such moist chicken and big shavings of Parmesan with real lettuce leaves. I also am trying their tiramisu dessert. I will let you know how that is! I love Italian food and am excited to come eat here In person to try the more exquisite dishes like osso bucco or the mussels. 

I'm also obsessed with their Mac n cheese. For some reason it's addicting! I have now ordered their tiramisu three time. It is light, fluffy and has a kick of espresso at the end like true tiramisu."}
{"text":"It was okay. The three of us ordered salads for lunch and they really were just okay. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I know that I was there close to when they opened but still disappointed. I would try one more time and depending on that experience may update my review but until then, a 3 is all I can give. One thing, the build out was really pretty."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and looked at menus because I have a vegetarian son, was entertaining a friend that had jaw surgery and needed \"soft food\" and I'm a fish person.  The menu here looked good so I decided to make reservations.  I arrived at 4PM when they opened because I was staying at a hotel right around the corner from the restaurant.  I wanted to get there first and check it out to make sure it was as good as the reviews claimed.  I told my iPhone to give me directions to Mancuso's restaurant and it popped up and I started to walk.  When I got to the \"you have arrived\" spot I was dumbfounded, there was no restaurant there just a big office building.  I googled Mancuso and there was no indication that I was at the wrong address but then I saw suite 201 (or something like that)  I tried to get into the building but the downstairs door were locked (it was Saturday)  I saw an escalator and took it and when I got to the top I saw a  big sign with the name of the restaurant.

We entered and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The food was absolutely the best I had tasted in all my time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I made reservations did my boyfriend and I to have dinner here on Valentine's Day. We had a very difficult time finding parking due to all the construction downtown (added to the rainy weather made driving a hassle). It wasn't until we were leaving the restaurant that we noticed the entrance to the parking garage was on Washington (would need to be driving west bound to see the entrance).

The restaurant is lovely, fairly spacious, with a large and inviting patio. If it hadn't been rainy, it would have been quite lovely to sit on the patio and see the lights around the city (the restaurant is upstairs). 

We were greated by a hostess who wasn't very peronsonable nor even acknowledged that we had a reservation but thankfully there was no issue being seated. The dining area is very pretty but the staff seemed to be in over their heads. Our drink orders were taken by one woman then we were given over to a very pleasant gentleman. It still took quite a while for our drinks to arrive. We knew we wanted to get an appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms, after reading about them on Yelp but it seemed like we were forced to tell the waiter that we were ready to order. He repeatedly came and left without taking our orders, even after we closed the menus and made it clear. 

Thankfully the stuffed mushrooms were delicious, there was so much cheese that it was difficult to even remove the mushrooms from the dish they're served in! And the sauce was so good that we ended up using the bread to wipe off every drop. 

My boyfriend ordered the parmesan chicken with alfredo sauce instead of marinara and I ordered the chicken masala with masala sauce instead of the marinara as well. I wish I had gotten the alfredo sauce instead, it was quite good. Both dishes also came out with a side of zucchini and squash thinly sliced and lacking much flavor at all. We enjoyed our meals but neither were worth the $23 price tags attached. 

The restaurant was a bit loud since there were so many people, and the music playing was some older rock (think Fallout style if you're a gamer, otherwise think 50's style). And the tables were sat so close together that if you're an eavesdropper, you'll be amply rewarded but otherwise doesn't feel very intimate. 

All in all I would say this place is worth visiting for happy hour but not really suited for a romantic dinner. The prices were steep, even for their more simple dishes and the service was lacking. We will likely not return, which is actually a shame because those stuffed mushrooms will be sorely missed but nothing else really stuck out."}
{"text":"Wow! My mother and I were absolutely impressed. We received superior service from the moment we walked in and the food was phenomenal! My mother had the Farfell & Chicken and I had the Filet Mignon, both were super tasty! The ambiance is beautifully lit with dim lighting and the décor was very elegant! If you are in the mood for Italian, seafood or steak this is the place you want to be. Perfect for any occasion!"}
{"text":"They treated us very well even though we came in without a reservation for 8 of us including two kids & a baby on a Friday!  I used to work at their other restaurant in Kierland (Bobby's) years ago & had never actually been to this location, but I'm glad that we decided to go there, because it was a really great experience overall.  The waiter did everything perfectly, brought the kids meals out first (since they were hungry and getting tired) that was a huge help.  The steak I ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing! The drinks were all correct, he was attentive, everything a waiter should be with no mistakes!  We will definitely be returning next time we are downtown and looking for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"We arrived to be greeted by Fran, the daughter of Mama Mancuso.  We were promptly seated and met with water service. Our head waiter David was a consummate professional. He personally selected our appetizers, oysters Rockefeller and \"borata\". Both excellent choices that were beyond my palette. Salads and cheesy garlic bread were perfect and unique. Main courses included lamb chops, lobster, lasagna and shrimp and scallops. What a treat. Take home is inevitable. Three person team shared Davids responsibility. Next up, aperitif. Gran Mangier, brownie and cappuccino."}
{"text":"So amazing. Try their tiramisu.. So light and fluffy and just so so delicious. The service is 5 stars and I will be back. Love love love.. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Fine dining this is NOT. Would love to compliment our server for all the factors she cannot control...and the bartender was good... but everything else was terrible. 
Very difficult to find this place, for one thing--and then when you do, you are greeted by a robotic, I'mnotputtingonemorebitofenergythanabsolutrlynecessarytoseatthesepeople hostess. Zero eye contact, no energy, no warm welcome or actual human interaction. Auto-pilot hostess. Not a good sign...an omen, actually!
Inside is a strange hodgepodge of poorly mixed modern booths and fabrics and old Italian mirrors and kitsch on the walls. No matter, our booth was cozy enough, we thought. 
Our pretty server was a delight and made it sound like dinner would be delicious. Au contraire. Veal meatballs are cut up to make the mountain of bolognese served, and the Seabass (delivered every week, they said later...) is a tasteless, fishy, blonde thing sitting in a wan tasteless brothy bed of a few pasta strings with feta cheese, of all things, hitting an uber-salty strange not on the tasteless concoction below. The vegetables were okay-- what you usually find in one of those old, traditional restaurants where you bring your kids because they don't care if spaghetti or tomatoes are flung to the ground. Definitely edible. But that fish was neither fresh nor fresh frozen nor edible. Even the wedge salad was relatively tasteless save for the extraordinarily salty kalamata olives. Low quality."}
{"text":"It was nice, the hostess seemed a little confused but waitress was very good.  Everyone at the table loved their food. I had chicken parmigiana and it was ok."}
{"text":"Easy to work with reservations! Great Service!"}
{"text":"Was there two nights ago, great service and food! I was there with my boss from Corp and staff.  We all loved it! The only downside was when dinner was ending and the individual that was asked by our awesome server to box up the leftover. The  lady said really they want that shit to go! I really felt embarrassed on how the lady judged my staff and I. Luckily I and only my boss heard the insult. Really should not judge a person and why the want it box!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Filet had no taste, special of the day Halibet had no taste. Truly a poor experience . Wait staff was good but they can't be responsible for the food."}
{"text":"Just ordered a Cesar salad with chicken for pick up. I opened the salad to put the dressing on and there is a bug crawling around in my lettuce. Disgusting. I assume the lettuce may not have been washed and straight out of a bag so the critter was hanging out. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"What a grand and unique decor for an Italian restaurant! 

Entrees are of savory delights to choose from!  Paella, lobster, risotto, oh my!  I loved it all! 

Glowing ambiance and other room has a grand bar! No dieting here!  2014 Conundrum California, added a sweet end to all tasty bites! 

Attentive staff! 

I had a lovely fine wine and dine here!"}
{"text":"Dined with a group of 8 yesterday evening.  From the stuffed mushrooms and calamari appetizers to the veal chops, everything thing we ate we enjoyed immensely. The service was without a hitch, they read the table well and provided just the right amount of attention. 

When back in the area I will be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened with our visit, but the restaurant was far under staffed, the management was trying to help but lacked any knowledge of the POS system. We stopped by for a quick drink and food before a show but we needed to be some what quick (within an hour ). No water refills, over charged (corrected), appetizers took 45 minutes. Over all unfortunately it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Was in town for a convention and passed this restaurant multiple times so I decided to check its reviews which seemed to be of either wonderful or horrible experiences, so I decided to take a chance and I must say it was a chance I'm glad I took. Although there are areas this restaurant definitely needs to work on, such as sitting us in an area where a party of 50 was seated when there were many visible empty tables in other areas; this seating causes our waitress to be slow to respond to us at times. However the food was superb! Everyone at our table of 6 was highly pleased with their option from the large juicy pork chop, the meat filled cannelloni, the ravioli, to the spinach salad. I personally got the Oscar Chicken which was a delicious juicy piece of chicken topped with crab and asparagus and a delicious sauce sided with risotto and fresh sautéed vegetables! Full of taste! One of those meals you keep eating even though you know your full. Now I wish I would have ended my dining experience here bc then I would have gave them a five for we all could not stop saying how delicious all these meals were, but we decided to get dessert and although the tiramisu tasted good, it was still completely frozen other than edges. I thought it was just my piece but no, 3 other pieces at the table where the same. After receiving the check, it took the waitress 25 minutes to come back over, bc she was tied up with this party, to take our credit card.  Overall though, the taste of the food completely outweighs the negative aspect of our visit and we all agreed we would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The ambiance to this place is awesome. The staff was very friendly. A previous Yelp review mentioned a particular drink that I wanted to try. It wasn't on the menu any longer, but they accommodated my order anyway....and it was delicious. The food was absolutely delicious. It is a little pricey, but worth it. I ordered the NY Strip, which was large enough to take home leftovers for dinner tomorrow. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The bar dining area is beautiful, the dining side is on the stuffier side but probably set for more of an intimate dining experience. There wasn't a lot of energy for a Saturday night but that's expected downtown Phoenix. We shared quite a few of the starters which were all incredible and the service was awesome from beginning to end."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited this place last Saturday after we couldn't make a reservation at another nearby place; we are glad we did.  Everything about the experience was great.  The waitress who helped us was friendly and helpful, but not too friendly.  The food was great; I did the seafood trio and my girlfriend did the meat trio.  Both were excellent and cooked perfectly.

One reviewer says this place is out of the way and hard to find. I disagree and if anything that's a perk, not a drawback.  It was quiet and had a great atmosphere.

I would and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The service was great. I was a little disappointed in the food, it was all dry and didn't taste fresh. We had higher expectations for a place with such a reputation. Their menu was great but I think it wasn't executed like it should have been. We will go back and try it again though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a couple nights ago with my coworkers, very nice and welcoming atmosphere. Although the service was a bit slow, our server was very apologetic and brought us an additional bread basket. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms (meat filling was delicious) and bruschetta (pretty good) for appetizers.
For the main, I ordered a filet mignon, cooked to medium perfectly. The steak was delicious and paired well with the vegetables and wild mushrooms. Mashed potatoes were quite dry and bland though, unfortunately.

Will definitely be back next time to try out other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I can not recommend this place. We ordered Oysters - they were warm and tasteless. After the first one, we stopped, because we were afraid of getting food poisoning. The Pasta was overcooked and you could taste only garlic. The dessert was the most tasteless icecream, I ever had in my life. Dont go here if you like good food."}
{"text":"Average food and terrible service!  My waiter, in describing the night's special, told me the wrong price, sides, and how the dish was prepared. Honestly what I received was completely different from what he described. When I told him this he shrugged and said he doesn't usually work there. Wow. 

The food was really average...salad had a smoky taste that I'm still trying to figure out.

The wine was also a different year than advertised on the menu.  

Basically these people don't seem to  understand anything about how to run a restaurants, i.e. Actually describe what food your customers will receive. 

Please avoid, you can do better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last night (2nd time). We made reservations at 6:00 pm for the outside patio. We arrived promptly at 6, and I quickly noticed the patio was not only full, but very loud. I checked in with the hostess and was told \"sorry, there's no seating on the patio\". I asked how was I able to make a reservation on Open Table making that request and she was unsure. Not a big deal, and figured we'd get a table inside promptly. A booth was cleaned and set for us, but before we could be seated the owner told the hostess \"no, they don't get the 4 top, give it to this party\" - they walked in AFTER US!!!  Umm...excuse me?!?! I asked why she would give our table away, and her response was you are only a party of two. So by this time, it's 6:10 and we wait. Another group came in, yep, she sat them too while we are still waiting!! I asked the owner if we even have a table and she says I'm doing the best I can! No, clearly she isn't!!  I then asked why a 6:00 reservation was available if she's giving our table away  to which she responded it'll just be about 10 more minutes?!? SERIOUSLY?!?! So I made a reservation for 6:00 and won't be seated until 6:20?!?!  I'm noticing during this time as we wait she's irritated with EVERYONE and does nothing to keep her composure or be professional!! FINALLY at 6:20 we are seated. Our sever was nice, however when asked what soft drinks they had, he responded \"I'm not sure, it's in the Pepsi family\". So this is your job and you don't know what soft drinks are served?!?! About 3/4 of the way through our dinner my husband received an email from OpenTable advising us that when we make a reservation we need to show up as it can be detrimental to the restaurant to reserve a table when nobody shows. He  responded and said we were almost done with dinner and about five minutes later they responded again saying Mancuso's finally checked us in confirming out reservation!! The food is good, but way overpriced. There are many options to eat at the prices they charge with a much better service from the owner!! Location is nice too! Bottom line, we aren't spending our hard earned money for mediocre food. The owner has lost our business and we will NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant!!! Hopefully she reads these reviews and will get a better attitude and appreciation for her customers!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great variety of options and the staff are awesome. My wife and I had lunch here before a concert and it was a perfect way to start a great evening. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were downtown for an event and my partner saw their sign. He was last there when they were at the Borgata. I've never been so we went in for drinks. I had to try something so we ordered beef & pork meatballs and risotto. It was great. We'll be back to try their main menu."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at this restaurant and we're so glad we did. Our waiter Piere made sure we had a pleasant evening. My wife enjoyed the seafood trio, which was the special of the night. My wife thought it was excellent and my chicken Marsala was to die for. The teamwork was outstanding. In a addition to our waiter Piere, two other staff made sure our wine glass and water were always filled and our garlic bread is fresh.  I highly recommend this place if you want to experience a memorable evening. Cheers to all."}
{"text":"I had the best Italian meal ever! I have been to New York, Chicago, Dallas..... of all places to find the best was here in Phoenix, AZ. I'm on travel from Virginia and my co-workers wanted to find Italian close by to our hotel! What a gem this place is! Service was memorable, Thank you Aaron! You're a special person with a great personality! I try to find the perfect eggplant dish, and here it is, layered eggplant and also loved the angel hair pasta with bolognese sauce - which was amazing! I can't wait to return to Phoenix ..... this place has me hooked! The best! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a timeless local diamond recently recreated in downtown Phoenix. The decor is elegant. The service superb without being too much. We had the cannelloni, meat lasagne after stuffed mushrooms and shared spinach, arugula and quinoa. Garlic bread was heavenly. Huge portions!  We did share cannoli which was divine!  We will return and hope you will try this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice atmosphere and has outdoor seating. We had a friendly greeting and attentive waiter. There was a group of 5 - the food ordered was gnocchi with veal meatballs in Alfredo sauce(light on sauce), cannoli - 1) marina & 1 Alfredo, lasagna and one of the specials -  all the meals were tasty. The wedge salad and Caesar salad were tasty too. The house wine you can't go wrong. 
The chairs were very comfortable!"}
{"text":"I visited Mancuso's and encountered good food and delightful service.  I ordered a Spinach, Arugula & Quinoa salad with goat cheese, figs, tomatoes in citrus balsamic dressing.  The flavors of the salad were very pleasing to my taste buds.  I ordered a natural Filet Mignon with a Béarnaise Sauce, Creamy Risotto and Summer Vegetables.  I enjoyed that they had their own private supply of natural grass fed beef.  I ordered a dessert that offered a small slice of Tiramisu and a Cannoli. I liked the Tiramisu best.  I look forward to a future visit to Mancuso's."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time before the Maroon 5 concert! Great service and delicious food and wine. I had the lump crab halibut and my friend had oysters and a Ceasar salad. We also shared the flourless cake. We will be back and if the food and service is consistent, I will change my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Coming from New York, this restaurant is okay, the veal piccata didn't have enough sauce on it and it was two little pieces of veal.  I am used to more meat, and the pasta was on the same plate, where it's normally served on the side & the Gravy was light.  Also, the waiter forgot to tell us about the specials so I had to remind him.  My husband's white clam sauce & linguini was just okay.....food wasn't hot enough.  However, the location is nice!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Service was superb! Food was incredible! We flew in today from Texas- tired and hungry searching for a good place to have dinner. We are so glad we stumbled upon this gem after being turned away from Hard Rock Cafe because my sick child who is auditioning for AGT tomorrow had a Starbucks cup in hand(medicine ball tea)! Mancuso's allowed us to bring the Starbucks cup in and we had a phenomenal dinner. Thank you so much, Mancuso's!"}
{"text":"Having a late dinner post the Red Dress Cocktail Party.... raising awareness for healthy hearts. We love Macuso's and so excited they are now in downtown Phoenix! Lobster a la Oscar one of my absolute favorites."}
{"text":"Two words.... happy hour! This place has one of the best happy hours in town. First, they validate paring in their garage for 2 hours. Second, they have all of their 'tinis' on special for 7$, and these things are fairly tasty. I tried their tini with fresh brewed espresso in it.... crazy good. Third, they have a ton of food specials. We tried their meatballs (you can choose the meat and the sauce) which come with garlic bread and their risotto. The food is all insanely cheap (e.g. you can get lasagna for 7$). We got the regular pork/beef meatballs in a spicy mushroom sauce, which were very flavorful and large. The risotto of the day was a plain parm risotto, which was simple but tasty. I will 100% return!"}
{"text":"Had New Years Eve dinner to night. Had the bruschetta for starters and it was excellent. The Roma tomatoes on the bruschetta were as sweet as sugar. A great starter. My partner ordered an entree of vegetarian paella, and I had a delicious lasagna. The desserts looked good but we were to full to indulge. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I love with their happy hour...so many cocktail options.   I had the mashed potatoes and stuffed mushrooms.  If I wasn't a lady... I would have licked the sauce of the mushrooms."}
{"text":"A truly wonderful dinner garlic toast served with oil and vinegar is addictive. My friends and I had several Martinis; Velvet kiss (a chocolate dream,) purple haze, a save myself (?). All incredible. I had shrimp and scallop scampi from the restaurant week menu, blissful.  Save room for dessert, the cheesecake was a generous portion. Very good, too. Service was remarkable. Decor is understated mid-century modern. The only issue came when I realized they switched my leftovers with someone else's from my table. Oh well, dogs enjoyed it"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food and great service. We had the rigatoni and the paella. Oh my god it was so good! To full to have desert. We will be back here again soon."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is a gem! The Mancuso family have been cooking mouthwatering savory food for many years and it is evident in each dish we have tried. The ambience is elegant and inviting! We love that there happy hour is daily!! Along with an impressive selection of martinis for a great price (my favorite is the Almond Joy but, I've tried them all -you can't go wrong!)there are beer and wine specials. You can easily fill up on appetizers alone. The lasagna is plentiful and delightfully good! The meatballs are melt in your mouth tender! We appreciate that Fran, who is co-owner along with her brother,always stops by our table with a big smile and friendly greeting- she is the other reason why we keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of about 10 people. Our table was ready and the atmosphere was very nice and clean. Our server was very attentive to everyone. The bread that comes out first is so delicious, I ate like 5 rolls before dinner! You dip the bread in oil and balsamic vinegar and it is just heaven! Everyone at the table ordered something different, I ordered the veal meatballs and risotto from the small plate menu with a house salad. The veal was super soft and tender, almost too tender! but the flavor was delicious. The risotto was cooked perfectly with great creamy flavor. It's hard to find good risotto because it's usually always undercooked and still hard and chewy, but this place got it right on. I tried a few of the pasta dishes my friend's ordered and those were also pretty tasty with great flavor and good amounts of seafood in them. We brought a small cake for our group to sing happy birthday and the server had taken it to the back to keep it cold and then brought it out with a candle and provided plates and forks for the table. Overall, great food, great staff and ambiance, and I would recommend this place for group gatherings or even date night!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for lunch. The place is very clean and nicely decorated. The food was amazing. We had a variety of things. I highly recommend this place. Fish was great! Pasta and meatballs! Yum."}
{"text":"An excellent, albeit expensive lunch option, Mancuso's has been on my downtown dining list since they opened. And because I work for a smaller bank, we had Friday off for Veteran's Day. It gave me the perfect excuse to head here with a friend who work in the Collier tower.

We started with the fried calamari, which was perfectly cooked and the warmed marinara they served with it was also divine. I ordered the linguini and clams; Jason ordered the eggplant parmesan. First, there were so many clams in my linguini, I mean an insane amount of clams! Not that I'm complaining. Jason said his eggplant parm was out of this world. The garlic bread was heavenly.

Surprisingly, there was hardly anyone there on Friday."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and the owners are fabulous. Great place for a quick lunch or a romantic dinner.  I have done both. The best part is they will cook food the way you want.  My fave are the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was even better!

Lisa was our server and she was great at recommending all. Of the good food and drinks. I had the veal special of the day, it was absolutely EVERYTHING!"}
