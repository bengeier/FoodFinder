{"text":"Went to honest lawyer after a night of bowling. Looking forward as it was Monday - all you can eat wing night. The place was empty except for a group of people ordering waters and coke. After 5 minutes waiting for our server at our table, we approached them ourselves. They said they saw where we were sitting and would come by after serving the cokes and waters to the other table. After 10 more minutes of waiting we decided to leave. I walked right by the waitress and she didn't say anything - no sorry, no please stay, no nothing. I can't rate the food cuz I never had a chance to order any. I don't think I'll go back - there's better places to go. And FYI - theres a better place to bowl 2 minutes up the road - World Bowl. And they have rockin' wings. 

-apparently you can't give a zero rating or half star, hence the one star."}
{"text":"if you're getting dragged here, be assertive and say no. This experience can be summarized in four words: cold food, bad service. I wanted to give this no stars but i didn't think it would be helpful:) 

waited a good 10 minutes for someone to let us know where we could sit.  A server was standing at a table that was really close to the front, chatting with customers, but really, if your'e the only server on the floor, wouldn't you keep an eye out on the front. She finally told us we could sit anywhere, so we sat near the tv to watch sports (NBA and NHL). Another server came on duty and came to bring us water. Apparently everything on the menu is 25% off, including drinks (so I guess that could attract more customers but i don't know, the service is a huge turnoff). 

The food took 30 minutes. Our table had ordered four burgers and two poutines. I talked to our server to ask if she can check on our food. Her response was that the patties were thick, so it was taking a bit longer. I was put off: it does not take 1/2 hour to cook 4 patties (even if they were 1/2 lbs). Our table was the only one that ordered food - everyone else was drinking beer. There's no reason that the food would take so long. We find out a bit later that they were out of onion rings (really... server doesn't know what the kitchen is out of). The server had actually called the kitchen staff stupid for not letting her know. I was annoyed because servers complaining about other staff to customers is extremely unprofessional and unsettling. I hate giving less tip to servers because I used to work in a restaurant and knew that tips were greatly appreciated. but she absolutely soured the eating experience. Plus the food wasn't great: When the poutine came out, the gravy was cold. My friend substituted yam fries for onion rings after finding out they didn't have any - yam fries were really salty, as was the gravy on the poutine. Fries were cold by the time they got to the table. Patties were good but that definitely did not make up for bad poutine and fries - come on, this stuff isn't hard to cook.

After dropping off our food, the server did not come around to see if we needed water and also didn't ask us what we thought of the food. Normally I would tell the server that food was too salty, etc etc, but i had a feeling that she wouldn't have cared. 

Only good thing the server did was put down a projection screen so we could watch leafs vs NJD."}
{"text":"service was bad. Managers are vulgar. Food specials that were promoted on the website were not offered to all patrons. Over all i dont see this place staying open for the next year. Everyone should just check out the tilted kilt beside this place."}
{"text":"This place been here forever, I used to go often when I was still in school.  Been back here a few times this year and still looks the same but it is empty.  They have all you can eat wings on Monday but there are only a handful of flavors to pick from.  I usually come here for sporting events such as UFC and just get a burger and poutine.  The food here can be a hit or miss but I like the poutine they have.  It is a gernerous serving and with real cheese curls.  They still have the games, foosball and billard.  Service is okay as the wairtress likes to disappear for a long while no where to be seen. And they just play with the phones but I can't blame them as there wasn't anyone there except 2-3 tables."}
{"text":"3 stars just for the cheap beer and memories, food and all the fun times we've had every Friday at this place. Large crowd, large TV. 

Strictly for age 25 and under. Good location and service. Gets very loud with the crowd and the music.
Dance floor opens up at times.

Famous for their yard of beer... And their nachos.....oh so large"}
{"text":"This place used to be super busy on weekends but the last time I came here, it was so dead.  It was literally a bunch of teenagers getting drunk off their cheap beer.  The only reason why we decided to come here was because there was a birthday celebration and decided to join.  The boyfriends' friend and myself decided to order the Mexi-Fries to share.  When we got it, I was so disappointed.  It literally came on a small platter with a little bit of green onions, a dab of melted cheese, some chopped up tomatoes and lettuce, sour cream with waffle fries.  Something I could have made myself and it would've tasted ten times better and more loaded with toppings.  They were pretty stingy on the toppings for the fries.  After that, we just settled with their cheap beers and played pool and shot some hoops.  We were even debating to leave early because the place was so dead and go to the next bar close by in that plaza.  I don't think I will be coming back here.. It was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went there with a couple friends for drinks.  Service is okay, but the place is so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation even if we yelled at each other.  Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"This place is ok if you're in Richmond Hill and you don't really know where else to go.  it does tick me off that they charge cover on the weekends and it is a PUB.  Where are you? New York???

Never tried the food.  Bouncers pretty well suck."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for honest lawyer's and decided to come here for dinner tonight... sighs... horribly disappointed... Back in the days, this place wasn't like this... I'm talkin like 8 years ago....what happened?? new management? chef change? ruined.. waited 25 mins for appetizers that tasted horrible.... I don't mind the wait if the food is good... 

Ordered French Onion soup, garlic bread, chicken caesar salad and burger... 

French onion soup: FAILED! The amount of sodium made it taste like sea water.. 

Garlic bread:  FAILED! worse than store bought ones from sobeys that i reheat myself at home..

Chicken Caesar: A-OK...only item that was OK...had enough chicken slices and salad, cheese was at par...

Burger with fries: FAILED! fries were fried to being burnt and oily...the burger meat had basically no seasoning and tasted like ground beef made into the shape of a burger..

Not coming back until I see some better reviews..."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with unlimited wings, right?

Well clearly you can when the wings are too small and your flavour selection is shall we say, mediocre. When your hot wings (by degree) are more sweet than hot you know you have a problem. 

Nevertheless, there were some positives from this experience. First, the Frank's Red Hot and Salt & Vinegar were pretty good flavours. Secondly, the service was pretty good. Our waitress was very attentative and quick with requests (extra fork, more water, etc.,)

There are quite a few wing options in Toronto so I would probably skip this one."}
{"text":"Ask anyone who went to school in richmond hill, or thornhill and they'll be able to tell you about Honest Lawyer.  A frequented bar for highschool students and locals alike.  It is a Molson bar, so expect your rickards, canadian, and coors light products.  

Most people come here to watch sports games and fights, heck, that's why I come there.  They usually play all the major events including the UFC fights.  Note though that they do charge cover for pay-per-view events (UFC) and it's 3 dollars cover.  If you come before 9 though to get a seat you don't have to pay for cover =).

Now the food... not good.  I mean, I don't think I like anything but the fries there, and even then, they aren't that good.  Their chicken wings are fried to a crisp (poo), their nachos are brutal (poo), and the rest of the menu is pretty unimaginative.  I think my favourite thing about it is their \"beer pairing\" list (ie. Mozzerella Sticks are best paired with... an energy drink LOL).

They do have all-you-can-eat wings on monday night, but for 10.95 for not so great wings, I think I'll just make my own.  At least they have good flavours though.  Try the curry wings if anything, they're pretty interesting.

So why come here?  Probably just for the game if you don't want to venture very far away from home.  If you're up for it though, you can find much better places to watch the game/fight.  I'm lazy tonight... Honest Lawyers it is."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with a bunch of friends on a random night for drinks. Great pub food. I had the fried cheesecake, and it was okay. Wasn't the best though. The waitresses are really nice, but don't expect the fastest service on a busy night."}
{"text":"Only was able to try the beer.  Ordered some fries and wings.  After 1.5 hours still not there. Asked the waiter multiple times, couldn`t give us an answer except, we are busy......."}
{"text":"Wicked. The first bar that has bowling lane. Lol. Lots of open space and plenty of room."}
{"text":"This place is pretty grimy. I guess if you're bombed and want to be a drunk idiot with your friends, then it's a good place. Anything beyond that, it's terrible. The crowd also seems to be lots of douchey brown guys.

I'd give it a 0 star if possible."}
{"text":"I always end up being dragged here by friends since it is one of the few bars in the markham/richmond hill area that have abundant seating.  The crowd here is my biggest gripe.  Most are wannabe gangsters.  The bar is always crowded, with not enough bartenders to get drink orders filled.  The music and sound system is just awful.  It sounds like they decided to increase the decibels in the hope that people would overlook the fact that they are using an archaic audio system that desperately needs to be replaced."}
{"text":"Came here because of a $30 groupon deal. Ordered the Mountie and Full Coverage burger. Since it was a Tuesday, we took advantage of the BOGO flatbread deal and ordered the BBQ Chicken and Pizza flatbread. The food was OK. The burgers tasted like something we could get frozen at Costco and oven bake at home. The fries were decent (a bit too salty for me but my dad loves it) and I absolutely loved the BBQ Chicken flatbread. 

The atmosphere was your typical bar type environment with lots of televisions and arcade games. There were plenty of tables and the chairs were quite comfortable.

Our total was just a few cents over $30 but the waitress said we didn't have to pay which is weird because we thought we would at least have to pay tax (but hey, no tax is great!). In the end we paid $16 in total for groupon + tip (waitress was very nice) which is not bad for the amount of food we got. (Edit: Turns out we got an additional 25% off our entire bill which explains why we didn't have to pay tax. Sweet.)

Overall I found this place to be decent but there are better restaurants out there for the same price. Recommend for sporting events or just to hang out and grab a few drinks."}
