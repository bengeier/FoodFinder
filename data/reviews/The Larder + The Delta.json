{"text":"I don't know much about southern food but I passionately love seafood. The perlou I got from here satisfied me in every perspective from quality to quantity. Its flavorful and fresh taste along with the nice presentation with some flowers satisfied both my eyes and my tastebuds. What adds more pleasure to the visit is the friendliness of all the staffs. During the short wait for my food (5min ish) they introduced their food and gave me some food samples to try. So the waiting time just flew by unlike some other places I can only sit in a corned browsing stuffs on my phone lol All in all it is great to find this place and I will certainly go back and try other items on the menu when I am around downtown."}
{"text":"Just ate hear for the first time. The food was amazing! I had the shrimp and grits and the chicken skin po boy. The shrimp was full shrimp with heads and everything! It took a little work to eat but the flavor was bomb! And the po boy was super crunchy and tasty! The flanked went really m well together! Definitely will be eating here again!!! 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My first experience here guaranteed many more!  I never had better brussels sprouts.  The KFC sandwich and French Dip were fantastic.  Great and friendly service, clean counter and they will accommodate a special order with pleasure, as I saw when a vegetarian wanted something adapted to her liking.  Fantastic restaurant in a fun location!  I love local!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Crispy chicken skin po boy was like having the best part of fried chicken, cut with sweetness and acid of green apple slaw, and just spicy enough. Cauliflower with blue cheese and Frank's was full of flavor, I wish it had more of the pickled celery. Chefs there took care and we could see them tasting as they went. Would definitely suggest this place when visiting DeSoto Market."}
{"text":"The five star rating is based upon it exceeding expectations. If you're looking for fine dining, this is not the place and I'm not rating it as a fine dining establishment. Now that we've laid out the benchmark, this review covers two dishes: the deep fried pigs ears and the perlou. Both were on the saltier side but I didn't let it knock down my love for this place. Fellow yelpers were knocking the pig ears so I almost didn't try it and you know what, if I didn't, that would have been a HUGE mistake. It was fabulous! Perfect combo of chewiness and crispy. It basically melted in my mouth. Biased - maybe a little. Who doesn't LOVE Cheetos?! Perlou was exploding with flavor. It was like a paella, crispy rice, and jambalaya had a threesome. ;) Need I say more?! I'll be back and this time I'm getting an order of the pig ears (without sharing)!"}
{"text":"Really looking forward to having their brussell sprouts and after a 20 minute wait I got them. First sprout was yummy but when I actually mixed up the bowl the peppers in the bottom were extremely salty. I mean like bad mistake salty. Like I dropped the whole salt shaker on these so let me hide them on the bottom salty. Really ruined the whole dish. Really no excuse and someone would have or should have known so serving them up  makes it extra sad. Not to mention once I mixed up the bowl there was no going back so whole dish ruined. Never ever eating there again. First 1 star ever"}
{"text":"We had six different items from the brunch and lunch menu. Everything was delicious and an experience of southern delights! Coming from Tennessee roots to a place that truly lived up to he southern soul was a perfect spot to celebrate Fathers Day.  Definitely had to try the fruity pebbles waffle, chicken was prepared very well and the omelette on toast was fab! Eat here... love the concept st De Soto Marketplace! It's like an indoor food truck with lots of cool places to sample different cuisines. The Larder + The Delta won't disappoint! Go... NOW!"}
{"text":"The menu looked decadent! My friend and I were in position to order at the counter, and one of the employees who was sitting at the counter got up and went around the cash register to take an order from another patron who had just walked up. It may seem petty to nitpick, but customer service is imperative to the success of a business. The cook acknowledged us and we verbally said we were ready to order--but we were not accommodated. First time at Desoto. We will have to try it again another time I guess."}
{"text":"Had their KFC sandwich and chips. Both were pretty good, though I wasn't crazy about the chicken meat itself, but the flavor was good. Very messy to eat, maybe a bit too thick of a sandwich. Seems like a good place all around"}
{"text":"The menu sounds a lot interesting than it is. The amount is not much. I got eggs with cheese inside of it. For a grown boy, not much food."}
{"text":"Love their cauliflowers. If you want really spicy delicious food, this is the place to go. And the owner is super nice. Prepare drinks and rice to go with it, so hot:)"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place and was quite impressed.  I ordered the pork Carnitas wontons.. Omg.... Holy delicious... You get like 5-6 per order.  I order 2 orders as a meal.  The vinegar type sauce it's served with is delicious!!! 

This is located in the Desoto market building.  High end food, great price on a casual atmosphere.  Counter service.  Staff is very friendly too.  Try it!!"}
{"text":"I had the cauliflower and roasted turkey sandwich.  They have a great twist on the cauliflower. Definitely not something yú see everyday.  Hearty slices of turkey and pork belly.  It was a lot thicker than I thought it was going to be.  The flavor of everything was exceptional.  The only downside is they are a bit pricy.  A little over $17 for the sandwich (with no sides or drink) and the cauliflower."}
{"text":"I am almost at a loss for words. It was that good. Yesterday I had the pleasure of going to De Soto Market and since I knew that I was going I scanned the menu ahead of time. Still, I had no idea of the pleasure i was about experience. The gentleman who explained the menu options to me was so knowledgable and I actually learned something. Plus he was so kind. A really nice young man. I am so sorry that I did not get his name, but no worries...he will see me again!
I had the ever elegant low country. Perlou...It was deliriously happy, so complex. Nice work Stephen I think you are a genius!"}
{"text":"ALL OF THE STARS. I will go back and review this place again in a couple weeks once the whole place gets in rhythm. But for now let's just say these guys had their sh*t together on an opening night that taxed everyone at DeSoto Central Market.

Fried cauliflower was amazing. Whatever they did to the celery was voodoo style stuff. I ate the bowl as a meal and couldn't have been happier. Now must systematically try everything else.

So happy! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"While out in Phoenix, I made a special trip to The Larder + The Delta. I wanted to try the Pig Ears, which were not on the menu for the day that I was there. The nice lady running the register asked the cook if they could make them for us anyways. He stated that it would not be a problem.  Once they were brought over it was a tasty treat. My mother and I both loved them. It was well worth the trip to this little food eatery.  Thank you guys."}
{"text":"I had the special (Kentucky Hot Brown with a Sioux City Sarsaparilla) and my other half had the KFC sandwich with jalapeño cole slaw and homemade chips. Freaking BOMB!!!! The service was awesome, very fast, and the food was incredible. We will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I didn't know about this gem but I'm glad we found it!  The shrimp and grits was delectable.  I love it when shrimps are ginormous and taste like lobster.  The fried pig ears was yummy.  It kind of tasted like pork rinds.  Definitely something to share.  I'd love to come back here again!"}
{"text":"My first time having this, it is so flavorful! I tried the breakfast biscuit and I must say this small dish will make my mouth water every time I think about it. Wish they had a place like this near home!"}
{"text":"First off, this restaurant is inside of a large building with DESOTO written on it. Inside is a big industrial artsy area that includes like 7 eateries. This includes THIS restaurant. I'm in love with the food! We had The Larder \"McRib\" and the KFC Chicken sandwich. The bread is great. The meat is great. The pairings of condiments and other gonna on the sandwiches was amazing. I don't tend to like sweet tea, but THEIR sweet tea was great! I would go again. It isn't fast food, so don't expect it to come out super quick, I understand that things are cooked to order. Be ready to break your diet. The ambience is great too! :)"}
{"text":"You are walking through the Desoto Cental Market and smell a smell of angels, a smell of the south (the southern kitchens, that is, not homeless gentleman Earl of the MLK Streets)- WHAT IS IT?! It's The Larder + The Delta! I know it just closed last week, but hear me out because this store is opening as a stand alone in the near future, so yes, there is definitely a point of writing a review for them because it will be up and running again.
This restaurant is my hands down FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix. It reminds me of home! I have to say that TL & TD's southern food is on POINT (coming from a previous Georgia native for over a decade). We came here and ordered the Louisiana Chicken Biscuit- dare I say, probably the best biscuit I have ever had in my life. The second time around, we ordered:
 
-Chilaquiles: This dish is one I haven't been able to find Verde-Style around town that often, so the fact that this is simply just listed on the menu made me smile. The tortilla chips underneath were cooked to perfection, leaving out crisp corners for the perfect texture. Definitely a hit on my list. 

-Pig Ears \"Cheetos\": You guys, this place makes their very own pig ear chips in house and rolls them around in CHEETOS?! Absolutely love. Every piece has an almost buttery consistency that melts in your mouth. Would be great to order by the box for a gathering, something different. 

-Louisiana Chicken Biscuit (a second time): Again, the best chicken biscuit I have ever had. The bar seating at the market allows you to watch the chef in action, seasoning every piece of the meal to perfection, coating the chicken with their own concoction of Louisiana Hot Sauce and finishing it off with a big fluffy biscuit.  

Needless to say, we are coming back here to try every single thing on their menu once their new place opens up- first ones through the door! The chef, Stephen Jones, of TL + TD was actually the first executive chef at Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails in Downtown Phoenix. Jones, keep doing what you're doing. I like where your head's at."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh and more fresh. Tried this place out yesterday afternoon in a rush. Tried the hoppin Johns if I'm pronouncing it right. It was great and fresh w farm fresh ingredients. Just missed a pinch of salt or some touch of cabin seasoning but nonetheless I would eat it as is any day of the week. And the fried chicken skin sandwich....whew! Different and tasty but left you wanting.., meat. I will be back to check out all the eating spots in the market."}
{"text":"So good. We tried the charred cauliflower, pig ears, hoppin john, and falafel burger. All were absolutely amazing. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"The cheeto pig ears were crispy tasty. I will start dusting all my food with cheetos. Of course the chicken was the best crust of spicy, sweet. Oh and get extra butter for the biscuits you'll know why after you slather it on the biscuit!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside an indoor plaza with multiple dining options. We were hesitant at first by the adventurous menu, however I am happy we dined here. The chefs were very knowledgeable and adaptive. High quality!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best chicken and waffles I have EVER had - and I love me some chicken and waffles. Great food, nice people, awesome way to spend a Saturday morning. Love this place :) The market is also pretty cool. #goodjob"}
{"text":"Placed order at 11:15 food came at 1 pm and it was wrong..... First experience at DeSoto Market. We went to complain and were refunded. That's why I bumped them up to a two. Would never go back. How do bacon and eggs take 1 HR 45 Min?"}
{"text":"My second visit here proved to be an important one as my opinion of this DeSoto concept rose tremendously.  To be sure, my first visit here was generally a good one, but with a lot of room for improvement.  This time around the menu had a better variety of items to choose from, the price was on point with the portions and the food itself was heavenly.  This time around I got an order of their fried cauliflower appetizer (which could've been a main dish in itself) which included celery, hot sauce, and what I think was a light cheese blend.  Fantastic dish with a kick of that hot sauce to be sure.  For my main dish I went with their salmon dish which included corn, okra, and an emulsion that (I believe) tasted like a combination of mustard, dill, lemon juice and horseradish.  This too was a delicious treat with a little bit of spice, but not overwhelmingly so.  

Total for the dishes plus tax was $20.  Unlike my first visit here, I really felt I got a great value (and portions) for the price I paid.  Chef Jones did a great job with the flavor combinations on these two dishes.  And his staff remains super friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.  I'll keep coming back to sample the menu further, but for now I can definitely put this comfortably in the four star category.  A perfect five might not be far away if the remaining dishes are equally as memorable as tonight was."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the downtown area. Guys in the kitchen are right there and are super helpful telling you what is on the menu and what is good. Have had a bunch of things there and everything was fantastic. My favorites are the chicken skin PO-boy and a gumbo style fried rice. Wow, the chicken skin PO-boy is a tasty bite and the rice dish had a ton of seafood and the spicy complimented the dish very well. Have been there a bunch of times. I keep on checking out the other places in DeSoto Market, but keep on coming back to The Larder. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious and sinfully unhealthy food. But totally worth it! Service was good. I had the chicken skin po boy; just like the other reviews stated, I kind of wished there was chicken meat in it. Still very good though! Prices are on the high side. I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Had the cauliflower (with blue cheese and homeboy's hot sauce) and the fried chicken skin poboy (which was on a Hawaiian roll), both of which were excellent.  The low country perlou was also great with the crispy rice, jumbo shrimp, oysters, clams, and andouille sausage.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"When your first two menu options don't work out and the chef suggest something you would have never picked, AND it's amazing!!! Good people with good food, love it!!!"}
{"text":"Just came by the Desoto Market and ate at this eatery. Tried their funky spin on food and enjoyed all the dishes especially the cauliflower.  Make sure you grab some beer to eat with the decadent foods.  Def a fun spot to eat at, bring friends or go alone, it's a casual and comfortable place to hang."}
{"text":"Can I eat here every day, pretty please?  This place is seriously legit...I am going to crave the cauliflower every day for the rest of my life...it was THAT good!  We also enjoyed the ham and grits...super tasty too!  I love that you can sidle up to the counter and watch the chefs make your amazing dinner.  They are beyond friendly, tell you about the dishes and make you feel really welcome.  I cannot wait to come back again and try some new dishes and definitely order that cauliflower yet again."}
{"text":"One thing, Right Quick--I love watching cooks love their jobs. Like day'm...

Probably the most enjoyable piece for me.  

Yeah, no, the food is great, but the chef's table is the view I crave. To see you toiling, prep work, calling orders, yelling dude to fire \"the wings now\" when I jussss finish placing my orders. 

...finely tuned orchestra--I don't know if I'd go Philharmonic--but you get me off on that shit. 

Y'alls pimps. Pop your collars. Dust your shoulders off. 

Let Pepper T. get all salty & 3-Star you cos she could only order brunch... what kinda entitled bullshit is that, right?

(Cough-WhiteProblems-Cough)

I ain't see her making no food; just saying. 

This is my 3rd time you've seduced me with your wares and went home fat and happy and had to take a nap. 

Gentlemen & ladies, you do great works. For those less appreciative of your endeavors, let us remind you, Shade falls behind the Delta. Not on it."}
{"text":"Our First Friday fun had us sitting on the stools and have the two young men stuff us silly. Fried Catfish was a beauty of a dish with just a tossed layer of cornmeal and the pig ears were toasty hot with great flavor. Generous servings will allow us to munch thru the next day on the fare. Small efficient kitchen really spotlights the cooks/ chefs and the disciplined hygiene is evident. Casual friend (executive chef?) seems to throw off the rhythm - as well as the cleanliness with an apron on/ off, a cellphone & a long do. I'll lean into the relaxed feel but it was noticeable."}
{"text":"So I came in to try some of the food during happy hour and did not realize that it was a collection of small restaurants sharing a space. I got the fried pork ears with (a very generous portion of) Cheetos dust. For five dollars I have to say it was a really filling portion for one person. In fact I'd say it should never be something you order for yourself-it's incredibly heavy and decadent. I tried a few other dishes from the other shops in the area and the food was just as good. The large selection actually makes it pretty hard to decide what you want. 

I would liken my experience to a fancy food court for hipsters. Definitely a place to check out when you're in the area and looking for an \"artisian\" meal of sorts."}
{"text":"Just finished off their take on the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. It was a mess of crispy breading, coleslaw,  tangy sauce, and Bleu Cheese on  a soft buttery roll. It all worked. I'm a fan.  Not easy to eat, but memorable. Now to try some of their other offerings...."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good everytime I visit.  The food is creative and affordable without being pretentious. The cauliflower is a must try item (fried cauliflower, smokey bleu cheese, pickled celery, hot sauce) its a perfect plate. Smokey cheese, spicey hot sauce, acid from the pickles and the cauliflower is meaty and delicious. Chicken skin po boy is a great snack as well. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Wish I had room to try everything. Yum! We sat at counter and watched other dishes being prepared. I wanted to try everything!  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"This veggie po' boy is good as long as you ain't po'. At $7 it is on the smaller size but it does come with chips which is nice. The veggies inside offered many textures and the sauce added a great spice note. I try many veggie sandwiches, some range from bread with condiments only to bread with condiments and avocado. This sub, really had some character and substance. 

As a note part of the fun of de-soto is that you can mix and match venors, Get a main at one and a side from another."}
{"text":"I wish I could recall specifically what I had to eat, but it's hard to keep up with the ever-changing menu. In any case, nothing has disappointed, from a Buffalo Chicken, to Grilled Cheese, to Turkey & Pork Belly sandwiches, it's always an experience! Definitely a place to check out if you're in a curios mood, you'll surely be pleased."}
{"text":"We had the cauliflower. They're essentially vegetarian hot wings made with locally crafted Homeboy's hot sauce and blue cheese crumbles. Battered and see fried crispy deliciousness.

The setting is in a shared business park called De Soto Central Market which is essentially a bunch of different open kitchen mini restaurants. Service was friendly. A few vegetarian options at this spot."}
{"text":"The first leg on my flight was delayed which meant I would've missed my connection. Delta (no relations) gave me a red eye flight which meant 2 things:

1) more time with my baby - check
2) opportunity to try a new place for dinner - check

With a quick search on Yelp, I found The Larder + The Delta. They had a very unique menu including fried Pig Ears with Cheetos flavoring, Seafood Perlou, Nashville Fried Chicken and many more. The Low Country Perlou was what really intrigued me and excited to try it. I'm a sucker for any type of seafood medley. 

The Larder + The Delta is located in the DeSoto Central Market which is an upscale and trendy food court. It was our first time at DeSoto's so it was kinda cool to be able to check out a few different places at the same time. 

We walked to the back to the L+D and ordered the Low Country Perlou ($23) and the Cauliflower ($8). It's definitely more than you would expect for a food court dinner. With tip and taxes, we were out about $38. Ouch! 

I have to admit that they were quite generous with the seafood items in the perlou. The seafood items included head on shrimp, clams, mussels and Andouille sausage. Unfortunately, the rice in the dish was over salted - inedibly salty. We ate all of the seafood out of it and left the rice. 

The cauliflower was tasty but $8 is a little bit too steep. 

With all of that said, I'd probably wouldn't come back as there are so many restaurants I have yet to ventured out to try.

OH... $2 off apps during happy hour which is M-F 3-6pm."}
{"text":"** READ CAREFULLY BEFORE GOING TO THE LARDER + THE DELTA **

Do you like food? 

Do you like GREAT food more? 

If you answered yes to any of those questions then go to The Larder + The Delta! 

I still cannot understand how food can taste so good. I would have taken a picture of my KFC but that prolongs the time before it is in my mouth... and that is unacceptable. 

Thank you to whoever came up with The Larder + The Delta."}
{"text":"Short Story- Disappointed because I wasn't expecting a Brunch Menu on Saturday. I don't like brunch Cuisine and nothing online indicates they do brunch on weekends at the time of this review. (5-29-16)  Got Cauliflower, It was awesome but I had to find lunch elsewhere.

Long Story-

The Larder and the Delta is a small Food Counter located in the Desoto Central Market Building. The Chef/Owner is well known for preparing innovative Masterful Foods. Locally from The Boulder's Resort and from the hotel restaurant called The Blue Hound. I was very excited to finely try lunch from The Larder + Delta. This is far from me and I don't get to the Phoenix Market often.

I checked their Facebook Page before my trip and noticed a new salad they offer that looks delicious! I also saw some previous menus for this restaurant and planned on enjoying many things.

I found out on Saturday I made the trip for only the Cauliflower Dish. To my surprise they do a weekend brunch menu that is different than what I was expecting. There is no mention of weekend brunch from their Facebook Page.

The brunch menu had a hotdog, a fried chicken skin sandwich and mostly all breakfast foods.

The only thing I got to try was the cauliflower. It was delicious. Tasted like the best light chicken wings you ever had. Like the kind of chicken wings that angels would eat in heaven. They were delicious! But then I just moved next door to share something else with my husband.

Long trip. Disappointed because I was expecting the regular menu. I know the chef prepares 5 star food but I would never travel across town for brunch foods.

The Larder and Delta serve WEEKEND BRUNCH

Expect BRUNCH on the Weekends

Three stars is a positive review. I just have reservations about this information not on the Facebook page."}
{"text":"I've tried too many things there, everything is great! I'm from IL, so you can trust my palet, lol"}
{"text":"It was just okay.  While the menu is unique, it is a little bland.  I had the chicken skin sandwich and like previous comments I wish it had a little meat to it."}
{"text":"This food reminds me of home so much. Love the southern flavors. The food is always fresh here and they are very accomodating if you have preferences."}
{"text":"Nothing but amazing food from this place. Their menu was forward and inventive featuring different ingredients like pig ear and quail but all tasted delicious. Definitely a must try spot for foodies!"}
{"text":"I think I have the five star review to desoto market but this is the place to be. This is the reason i would come back. I described my visit in the other review so I'll wrap it up here. It's amazing. Chef talks to you and makes the right suggestions. He told me the way to go was the fried quail and biscuit. He wasn't lying. The grave as out of this world. I'd have preferred real cutlery vs plastic because I was seated at the bar top but that's so minor to me. I'd have eaten everything with my fingers to get another biscuit. I'll def be back to try other dishes on his menu. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Food looks good but you can't order full menu all day. I ended up not getting anything because everything I wanted weren't being served yet. I hate the location. Staff also seemed too lax. Could do better with customer service."}
{"text":"The braised pork belly sandwich gave me a bad grease headache.  The kind you get from eating cheap grease such as hot dogs or cheap pizza.  Plate was loaded with tons of grease. 

Taste of pork belly was decent.  The sandwich bread tasted stale.  Home made chips were really good."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed with my last experience here. I ordered the cauliflower and the shrimp and grits. Both dishes came swimming in butter. There was about an inch of butter at the bottom of the cauliflower dish and I watched the chef put in a huge chunk of butter in the pan right before he took the shrimp off the stove. The shrimp came with full shells, head, and long stringy antennae, wasn't de-veined, and the dish was greasy AF.  I didn't enjoy the long stringy antennae that would get stuck in each bite of greasy grits or the fact that I had to get my hands filthy and almost burn my fingers to completely peel the shrimp. When I complained, the chef told me this is how their shrimp always is but I've had this dish before made by a different chef and the shrimp was clean, without head on and no antennae (see other pictures that people have posted where head is not on the shrimp and there's no antennae). I also had to ask the chef for a new bowl for my cauliflower because there was so much butter at the bottom of my bowl that half of the cauliflower was submerged in it. Everything was so greasy that it gave me a horrible stomach ache afterwards. The first time I came here I had the same shrimp and grits dish and it was night and day. Not sure if I want to keep trying this place. For the price, they need to step up their game. Cleaning the shrimp, trimming the antennae and deveining the shrimp would be a good place to start. If you visit, maybe just stick to sandwiches or something that doesn't involve having your meal cooked in 2 sticks of butter."}
{"text":"Had the chicken with biscuit. So awesome. Chicken was so most, nice and spicy, and the biscuit......I have never had a biscuit so perfect and beautiful. Sorry, but I took the picture after we ate almost half, half of the biscuit is definitely gone. It was huge when it arrived. Can' wait to go back and try other dishes. Also had the avocado appetizer with rock shrimp which were perfectly cooked and crispy at the same time. LOVED it."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken Skin Po Boys.  Pork Belly.  Fried Cauliflower.  Wow.  I hate cauliflower.  I wouldn't have eaten every bit they put in front of me.  Incredibly good!  Unique menu, delicious food, charming guys....what a great place for lunch!  Wish it was handier to Cave Creek...but maybe for the best.  I would be a permanent fixture!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I should have gone with my first inclination to get the fried chicken on biscuit. I ordered the fried tomatoes. It was greasy and (as they were out of burrata cheese) the jam provided no balance. My friend had the BLT. Noble bread is delicious, but it was over buttered. It actually dripped down her hand when she bit into it. It was not the tomato juice. Service can take some time, especially when only one person was working."}
{"text":"Inside the new Desoto Central Market in the historic Roosevelt district near downtown Phoenix, Yard Bird features a very exciting fresh, local menu with southern leanings. Divided between small, tapas like dishes and a few larger specials I ordered all over the menu because it was so intriguing. 
Their \"cheetos\" dish of pig ears was really marvelous. Cheesy, deep fried and crispy if you didn't tell anyone it was pig's ears they would eat it first and ask questions later it was so yummy. 
I love, loved the vegetarian falafel,fava bean burger. I know..what business do I have going vegetarian after the pig's ears. But I do swing both ways. It was hands down the best veggie burger I've had. Super moist and flavorful.  

They are open for lunch and dinner and also the Desoto Market has a bar scene going on there with music. There is indoor and outdoor dining and near one of Phoenix's new bike borrowing stations. The market has lots of bike racks and 2 large parking lots next door."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the shrimp and grits, the hash and the heirloom tomato salad. While all of them were exceptional, my favorite had to be the salad. I'm normally one to error on the side of savory but between the homemade ricotta, the peppery corn bread, and the breathtaking glacier lettuce, I found myself eating it more than my shrimp and grits. The grits were perfect and the shrimp was completely whole. Something about it was off putting and completely captivating at the same time. Side note: Please use Crystal hot sauce forever. It is the only one. The hash was delicious and unpredictable. The eggs were cooked perfectly. All in all, I can't wait to try more of what they have to offer there."}
{"text":"The Larder + The Delta was quite a miss for me.  Had to come here three times to actually get the perlou because their menu is different on Saturday mornings. 

My boyfriend and I split the perlou, the pig ears, and the cauliflower. The perlou was pretty good! Decent amount of seafood and really flavorful, but the seafood was overcooked and the rice to seafood ratio was so bad.  Looking back, I'm kinda pissed I got charged $16 for this dish. The cauliflower and pig ears were both awful, and we ended up throwing the majority of it away. Chefs, what is up with your obsession with fried pig ears lately?? It's not good deep fried. You lose that unique gelatinous/soft rubbery texture of the ear AND the crunch of the cartilage!! You basically turn it into a bastardized version of pork rinds. The Cheetos on top added nothing to the dish. Don't get this, especially in the summer. You're just asking for a stomachache. The cauliflower was just unimpressive. Too much going on. Deep fried AND Frank's AND blue cheese. Ick. 

Honestly, the food and the price alone makes this place a two star establishment, but I'm upgrading to three because I think these guys are really trying to make good food and have the potential to do so but... Less is more. I don't think the average American population is going to go cray for non deep fried pig ears the way us Asians do, but I think marinating the ears first will give you a lot better flavor than just sticking Cheetos on top. I might come back and try some of their other stuff. Will update if I do!"}
{"text":"I only do reviews when a place warrants it. I especially don't do stupid reviews of non-service places, such as tunnels or freeways! That said, The Larder and The Delta had the finest fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. And, that cauliflower dish? Amazeballs. If this place was in San Francisco I'd be making weekly visits."}
{"text":"An enthusiastic 5 stars. Every so often while I'm on the road, I stumble across a true hidden gem. The Larder and the Delta definitely qualifies. I wish I could say that I found this on my own but it was referred to me by a friend and fellow road warrior. 

The surroundings are pedestrian. Think LA Central Market or Columbus North Market but a lot smaller. Sitting at the counter I was greeted by chef Marcus. We talked a little about the menu before I settled on the low country perlou. I ordered a cauliflower small plate as well just for the hell of it. Watching Marcus cook was half of the enjoyment for me. It was obvious he had a passion for his craft. 

The food? Delicious! If you enjoy a good Spanish paella, you will love the perlou. Fresh seafood, perfectly cooked rice with an addicting crust (socarrat). 

Yeah, I liked it."}
{"text":"We finally had the opportunity to try this micro-restaurant in the Desoto. It was a Sunday night, so the place was fairly quiet. Walking up to the counter, we were intrigued by the menu. The chef was super friendly and explained each item in detail. Since we were with others, we ordered practically the entire menu, which, while small, is ambitious for the tiny space. We decide to go get cocktails at the main bar and by the time they were completed, nearly all of the food was ready. It is served in paper boats and cups and we headed upstairs to partake.

Every item was delicious. I particularly enjoyed their take on cauliflower which was twist on Buffalo chicken wings, but so much better. The fried cauliflower had blue cheese, a hot sauce and celery leaves. Much better than any wings I've ever had. The shaved catfish was pretty amazing, too. By cutting thin slices of catfish and then breading and frying them, the ratio of textures was considerably better than the traditional fried catfish filet. The pickled cabbage slaw was nice and tart to cut the richness. A couple of dishes featured traditional golden rice from the South and we loved how some of the rice was intentionally allowed to crust on the pan and char a bit. This resulted in textural interest and some smokey and charred notes.

Even though Stephen Jones, himself, was not in the kitchen, his fellow chefs executed everything well. The ingredients were true to Southern cuisine and the dishes were prepared in a way that respected the traditions while innovating. Nice work!"}
{"text":"Ended up here somewhat by accident. But this place is amazing. The location is in a trendy pseudo food court type setting with several other specialty restaurants. Had the Hot Chicken and the Beans and Rice....bother were amazing. Chicken was just right on spice with great crispiness. The rice was sticky rice then crisped up perfectly....oh and the biscuit with the chicken would make your souther grandmother jealous. Wonderful food and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"First off- great concept! Desoto Market is practically a food court with plenty of parking. Based on Yelp reviews, hubby and I decided to visit. We got a parking spot on Saturday night pretty easily and there weren't many people around. 

Larder + Delta was our first choice and decided on the pig ears and perlou. Initially, hubby tried to order a beer and they were all out. They also ran out of the spicy ingredient for the pig ears or \"Cheetos\" but told us they would give us hot sauce to make up for it. 

The pig ears were hot and crunchy. I liked them, but they weren't to die for and I'd probably skip ordering them next time. A woman next to us ordered the perlou first and it looked delicious so we got that. It was a generous portion of rice, mussels, shrimp, oysters and sausage but it was so salty that I could barely eat the rice. The seafood I was able to get down with, but they probably need to lay off on the salt and spices next time. 

Overall, it was my first time and the two gentlemen working there seemed nice and at least the hubby enjoyed the food more than I did."}
{"text":"Comfort food. It's a name we all know, it's a special kind of comfort that fills not only a longing of the soul  (soul food) but fills a belly in need of wholesome, flavorful sustenance.

If you know southern cooking, if you like deep fried -and even if you don't, there will be something on this menu to titillate your southern senses.

Keeping it green with a southern twist:
The heirloom tomato salad. It's the peppered cornbread croutons, cured strawberries and ricotta that make this a unique and southern take on a local favorite.

Big eats and deep fried fun:

Shaved farm raised catfish with charred kohlrabi kraut. The cornmeal is mixed with garlic, cayenne and pepper to give it an extra kick, and dip that into the pickled mustard seed tartar sauce and it's absolute perfection.

Fried chicken skin po boy. Very crispy, very deep fried, peppery, and basted with a simple yet delicious hot sauce aoli.  The tang comes from the jalapeño slaw.

Little eats but big sensory experience.
Chicken fat biscuit.
Need I say more...
Okay, I will. It's certainly nothing you would expect to find in the south, it's a decadent order of two quarter pound sized biscuits with a healthy dollop of local crow's dairy butter pecan goat cheese. It looks like gravy, and it's anything but. Sprinkled with candied pecan and honey, this unique spin on the biscuit and gravy staple of American breakfasts is so uniquely memorable.

This is a spot you go when you want to be very very full, and you will definitely want ti arrive during a slow time, like 4p on a weekday - before people start arriving after work. Try a little or try a lot, try five different \"little eats\", you will be so very happy you came."}
{"text":"Peg and I  walked through this new concept (DeSoto Central Market) a couple of weeks ago and last night decided to sit down and enjoy it....fork to mouth. 

WOW!! 

Chef Stephen Jones is once again creating magic!  We over ordered (no shocker here) to get a sampling of the menu. I had been thinking about the low country perlou (white shrimp, clams, smoked oyster, andouille sausage, carolina gold rice) and it was incredibly flavorful. The hoppin john (sea island red peas (black eyed peas)  and the same rice) is a must. The AZ beets (bbq pearl onion, escarole, and beet maple bbq sauce) was also excellent. There was a heirloom tomato salad with strawberries, peppered cornbread croutons and  (I think) goat cheese that was cool and refreshing...and addictive.  A pulled pork belly and collards dish was simply phenomenal. Because I had also been thinking about it since I saw the initial menu, I tried the fired chicken skin po boy (jalapeno apple cabbage slaw and crystal aioli) and it was incredible. Breakfast will soon be in the works and we can't wait.  The atmosphere is vibrant., the service friendly, and the whole vibe at the place is sooo inviting. Parking is not a problem. This whole area is being re-energized with great restaurants and Chef Jones is right in the middle of it!    Dr. B"}
{"text":"All I can say is WoW!!! Biscuits are on point!! The chef and Jeremy were both awesome and even gave us a free yummy cauliflower app for free while we waited for fresh biscuits! This place is dope!"}
{"text":"It's my first time to try their dishes. I tried their chicken fat biscuit and enjoyed everything, especially the tender belly. Settle yourself to grab few glasses of beer to complement with your food. It's a unique food experience, best for hang out spot."}
{"text":"Love me to biscuits and gravy! This place is amazing.  The turkey sandwich is famous."}
{"text":"Finally, made it back to this place.  Thought I would round out my day with an early dinner.  This time I tried The Larder + The Delta.  Very simple menu, approximately 14 selections...I opted for Fried Chicken Skin PO-boy Sliders, that were topped with an apple slaw on Hawaiian Bread dinner rolls and the Sweet Potato Poutine Fries, that was topped with Smoked Pepper Bacon, Goat Cheese and white peppered gravy.  The food was very decadent and full of flavor, how can one go wrong!!! The service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We've gone once a week for the last couple months. Crispy pig ears, Buffalo-Wing style cauliflower. Hoppin' John that will blow you mind because it's just beans and rice, and it can't possibly taste this good. The crispy chicken skin Po Boy is the best part of the chicken.

Both the Hoppin' John & cauliflower are vegetarian, and can be ordered vegan.

Service isn't super fast if it's crowded. You can sit at the counter and watch them cook, or sit someplace else and they will bring it to you."}
{"text":"FRIED CHICKEN SKIN PO BOY. GIT IT. 

I ate at the counter by myself and ordered 3 dishes. Probably too much, and it would've been great to have shared it with people, but oh well. 

I didn't like the cauliflower that much, even though it's one of their recommended dishes. The pig ear cheetos were good but then I started feeling really gross after from all the fried stuff I had. You really should be sharing your food though."}
{"text":"I literally have never tasted something so perfectly made. The flavors were so different and perfectly put together. My 2 year old was killing the pig ears she loved them. And I had the cauliflower and holy mother of god that was so good! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food from the perspective of a foodie.  Highly recommend the Perlou, essentially a paella-style dish with New Orleans flavors!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise order desert peach cobbler calas not what I was expecting a combination of a fritter,cobbler and sweet goodness with honey ,powder sugar all I was missing is a glass of milk."}
{"text":"I am really sad and upset to find out this establishment has closed as I am just getting around to writing the review... This restaurant had by far the best chicken sandwich that I've ever had. The cauliflower was amazing too."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The chef was also very nice and courteous. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the Brussels Sprouts. They're beautifully roasted and served with two different kids of peppers. I'm not normally a sprout fan, but I'd order these again in an instant. 

We felt the portion size on the grits was a little small considering the price, but the plating was beautiful (I wish I'd taken a photo) and the taste incredible. 

We definitely want to return and try additional items on the menu."}
{"text":"TIP: it's inside the Desoto Central Market! & it's an amazing place!!! Loved all the food!"}
{"text":"Food for the soul. Menu changes but each dish is cooked just right. Southern cooking updated. Locally sourced. Chef Stephen is great as there are not many places to eat like this here. The vegan options were tasty as well. #approved"}
{"text":"Chef Stephen Jones and the best of his crew from Blue Hound will put their mark on the exploding downtown restaurant market with Yard Bird. Located in the fully renovated historical Desoto building in downtown Phoenix. WOW!....that menu! Southern Fast Casual. We sat at the counter and and kept ordering!!!! AZ Beats, Tender Belly Cheetos (Fried Pigs Ear strips), Tender Belly Pork Belly, Cauliflower and the most incredible dish was the Chilled Pea Soup and I hate peas!!! Just GO!"}
{"text":"After five visits, I'm happy to say I love everything I've ever ordered from Yard Bird + Larder. Even the most simple sides are bursting with flavor. This is the shining star of DeSoto and now the main reason I go there."}
{"text":"Just a bad, bad experience from start to finish. Only guy working at the stand had zero personality which started the whole thing off poorly. The pig ear cheetos are a novelty and really not interesting after one or two. KFC Sandwich was not tasty and was actually made worse by caraway seeds...who the hell cooks with caraway seeds? Not an experience I will choose to repeat, especially after having perfect fried chicken just days before at Tuck Shop."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at The Larder + The Delta once, so keep that in mind. 

The staff was very friendly and energetic; I think that says a lot about what they are doing and it makes me want to return! I tried the Nashville Hot Chicken. Now, I know there are variations of Hot Chicken, but when I have Hot Chicken I compare it to Hattie Bs, so maybe I should have tried something else. Though,  even if I disregarded my expectations, I would still only give it a 3. The dry rub seemed uncooked and powdery, to the point that it dried out my mouth. The taste was pretty good, it was sweet and definitely had some heat. I will go back and try something else, and hopefully get to update my review to a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"Finally got to stop by here after a month or so of telling my vegetarian girlfriend about it (somehow a name like the Larder doesn't seem to appeal to vegetarians). Started off with the Brussel sprouts because I knew she loves those and a fried chicken skin po boy. We were so blown away I went in for another 2 dishes - the Buffalo cauliflower and pig ears - also spectacular. I've had a lot of Buffalo cauliflower in the last year or so but this was by far the best I've had. The food is made fresh to order and the portions are surprisingly large. I'll definitely be stopping in for some big eats next time!"}
{"text":"I came to the DeSoto Central Market during First Friday and ordered a cauliflower and a fried chicken po boy from The Larder + The Delta. The cauliflower, which was similar in taste to buffalo chicken wings, was great, but I was a little disappointed with the po boy. The sandwich came on very small Hawaiian buns, and the chicken skin was too greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Came here for lunch and had an unexpectedly really good sandwich.  Roast pork that was rubbed in mustard, on a roll with some local gardiniera.  The pork was moist, juicy, and tender - well roasted, juices dripping from the meat onto my hands.  It was messy, but a good messy.  The gardiniera was pretty weak, lacked punch, didn't add near enough the acidity to cut the richness of the pork, but you could still taste bits of it and it added something - minimally.  This was a Larder + Delta equivalent of an Italian beef, just not dipped, and using pork.  It was definitely worth it.

Comes with thick-cut housemade chips that were also good.  

On previous visits, we've had the perlou, the cauliflower, the pigs' ears, and the hoppin john.  The cauliflower is excellent, get it all the time.  The pig ears don't quite measure up to Crudo's.  The Cheeto dust is unnecessary, overpowers a lot of the porkiness.  Will probably ask to leave it off from here on out.  The hoppin john is filling but a little bland.  But they use good peas in it.  Finally the perlou.  It's a good portion, and the way they prepare it you get crispy bits of rice from the frying pan.  Some of those bits ended up burnt - the rice, though my beloved Carolina Gold, seemed undercooked.   The way it's prepared here is not as \"wet\" as I like my perlou, but there is plenty of seafood and you taste the essence of the South in the completed dish.

I'm a big fan of Chef Jones since his Blue Hound days and am glad this is here.  Some dishes are uneven, some better than others, but all in all, he sticks to the ethos he has written up on the chalkboard in the store and puts out some good, soul-satisfying food in the process."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  Seafood purloo blew us away, with crispy rice (unbelievable / must try) and shrimp and clams, mussels and sausage. As good as it gets.  Kentucky Fried Quail was crispy, golden and full of flavor.  Better than anything in Nawlins.  Great work Chef Jones."}
{"text":"My gawd.. that hot chicken biscuit . DOPE. Was here visiting but I'm willing to move to Phoenix just for this place."}
{"text":"Superb food and superlative service...this little space simply serves some of the most creative food known to me. Don't be scared away by the lack of decor as you should simply focus on the menu and its tasty offerings. Some of what I had today: the cauliflower, the peaches with burrata and the KFC sammie...all were superbly fresh made and bursting with flavor. Staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable...a must try when downtown or cruising the central corridor. Well done Chef Jones !"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times and all I can say is, \"more please\"!  What really prompted me to update my review was the brunch options!!  Today was my first time experiencing the brunch menu and it was awesome!! My Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich was amazing!!  The crunchy skin and juicy tender chicken took center stage for me, literally finger licking good.  To top it all off, I was able to enjoy the best Cinnamon Roll I've ever had.  It was like a slice of heaven in your mouth, so phenomenal!!!  I will make a special trip back just for those C-rolls, so delicious.  As soon as you sink your teeth in, you know you've experienced the REALS!  Good ole fashion, home cooking"}
{"text":"The Boy has been wanting to stop by The Larder + Delta for some time now after our last visit. We were afforded the opportunity to stop by and were not disappointed.

The Boy ordered the Nashville Style Hot Chicken, I ordered the Burratta Cheese to share and the Fried Chicken Skin Po Boy as my entrée.  The Burratta is a must try if you love cheese.  The chef cooked the squash in that amazing cast iron skillet with some brown butter, then pulled out a whole leg for the ham and sliced off pieces.  I don't often have thoughts of theft, but I wanted that ham leg for my own and thought of various ways to get it into my possession.  The pickled mustard seeds added the right amount of sweet and bitter to bring the whole dish together.

The fried chicken skin po boy was amazing as well, a little messy but it was so good it made me wish I was able to take home the left overs.  The portion size was great as well.

The Boy wolfed down his hot chicken which was indeed, HOT.  It was so hot, he stated sweating.  He raved about the sauce saying it was the right ammt of spicy with a little bit of sweet.  The biscuit it came with.  Let's talk about this biscuit because I have dreams about this biscuit.  It was HUGE but was so buttery and flakey it made me wish I had ordered just the biscuit for myself. 

The staff deserves 5+ stars alone.  Our chef was amazing, attentive, and made us some crazy amazing food.  I would recommend this location to any foodie, especially one who loves southern style food.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I have ever had. The perfect blend of spices, crispy and hot. My husband and I split the plate and I am so full. The guy (that I think is the owner) was very friendly and quick to help. We will bring our out of town guests here to show them Phoenix has the best variety of food that anyone could want."}
{"text":"I can't fully review this place as I only tried one item, the hoppin John. Now, this was a decent dish, although I'm not sure what all the fuss is about... It's beans and rice essentially. It's good, but doesn't seem difficult to make at home. Further, it's a little expensive. I'd make a return trip here and try other menu items."}
{"text":"\"Holy fucking shit!\"  These are the first words out of my mouth after sampling the fried pig ears, aka Cheetos.  At $5 this surprisingly affordable little nosh is a delightful surprise of savory crunch  and melt-in-your mouth goodness.  Still eating. Must return to food. More review to come. Happy happy happy."}
{"text":"What a neat set up! This little dime is a great spot for a group! The restaurant is local inside desoto central market along with a handful of other great restaurants. I wanted to try the prelue but it's served till after 4pm.
Instead I had  the catfish pro boy! It was an excellent choice!!"}
{"text":"I started eating here when they first opens at the DeSoto Market. I love the Shrimp Boil. Most of the guys and one of the Hong ladies are culinary trained and work under the direction of Chef Stephen. Sunday brunch is the best."}
{"text":"Loved their cauliflower and breakfast burrito. The entire DeSoto market was fun and unique. The restaurant is inside the market...do not miss this one."}
{"text":"Go!  Bring friends!  Order one of everything then go grab a drink at the bar to drink with it all.  Come back, sit at the counter and watch, what feels like your own private chef, create each beautiful artisan dish right in front of you. I have been a handful of times and went twice one weekend.  I love this place and the concept of the entire building.  Aaaaaamazing!!!!"}
