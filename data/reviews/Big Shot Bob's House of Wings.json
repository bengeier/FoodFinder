{"text":"More like Big shot Bob's house of wing dings. This place is over rated. I did like the sauce but I don't think they use quality wings. Buffalo Chicken salad was average at best."}
{"text":"The food is ok and I'm interested in trying different menu items. They take long to cook so call ahead. I stopped in once and it took 35 minutes. When I had it delivered it took an hour which was reasonable. I've had the lemon pepper wings and the black & gold wings. The size of the wings are great but some seamed over seasoned. I wish there was a way to get an order with 2 flavors. You have to get them separately or order like 50 wings to get more than one  flavor. The place has potential so I'll try different items over time."}
{"text":"The wings were good. Decent size, cooked well, and the sauces were delicious. My only complaint is that it's pretty expensive especially if you want to try different flavors."}
