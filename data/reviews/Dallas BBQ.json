{"text":"I like the restaurant, it's conveniently close to where I live. The the chicken (no matter what form you get it in) is tasty but consistently dry. Some of the staff is very welcoming but there are certain others where I dislike them in different severity. I like the idea that they kept what Scores was doing so well. Dallas BBQ kept the soup and salad bar option. All in all, the restaurant is okay."}

{"text":"Dallas bbq is alright .. We stopped by here before going to the impact game .. It did the job ... Wouldn't get out of my way to come back here though"}
{"text":"Restaurant type rôtisserie de bas de gamme. La nourriture est bonne, mais pour le même genre je recommanderais scores plutôt. Par contre le décor est beau !"}

We went off hunting for a local Montreal restaurant after visiting the Biodome..... who would have figured we'd go to a restaurant named Dallas BBQ in Montreal after finding nothing else we were interested in. We got by without speaking any French perfectly fine.

This place has great value. As of present, ordering any menu item (the prices of which run pretty cheap) comes with unlimited salad bar. The salad bar is well-stocked with salads, dressings, fruits, pickles, soup (2 kinds), etc and is the main reason why I've ranked this place so high - the value is definitely high for hungry people. It looks like they plan on eventually charging for unlimited salad bar.

The Pizzaiolo (chicken white meat in a tomato sauce with pizza type seasonings) was okay."}
