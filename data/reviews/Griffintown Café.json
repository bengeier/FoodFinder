{"text":"We attempted to come for breakfast this morning, but we never made it in.  They advertise the opening hours, but don't respect them.  We waited 30 minutes outside, payed a parking spot in advance when we got there, but no one ever showed up to open the business."}
{"text":"Brunch review: Great food, no one on the table had any complaints. Portions aren't big enough to satisfy those with a ravenous, post-night-out hunger, but other quite generous. The only notable downside is the very slow service, they seem to be quite understaffed. Despite the stress, the waitstaff is very friendly. Don't go there if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I went to this café last week for an afternoon coffee. The atmosphere was lovely. There were few people since it was about 4:30 pm. My friend and I sat on the terrace. It was sunny, but the sun did not bother us; the seating outside was surrounded by trees serving as a natural parasol. I ordered a cappuccino with soya milk with a chocolate mousse. The two were delicious. If you are looking for a place to meet with friends in intimacy, this should definitely figure high on your list of options."}
{"text":"As stinky as you'll be walking out of there, you've got to put olfactory vanity aside, and go for it. BEST potatoes (come in a mashed up ball) that taste like Cosmo's without being Cosmo's.   Try the breakfast menu (classic eggs, salad), the Mexican breakfast, the grilled cheese, eggs Benedict (insanity) and the list goes on. Actually, try everything. The only reason I witheld the fifth star is because there ain't no freshly squeezed. And I love my freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. Our waitress came over after we had already been sitting for about 10 minutes, then took our order. It took 40 minutes for our soup and salad to come out, and then another 45 for our entrees. A table of six that came in after us, without reservations (which we had), got their food and finished eating before we even got our soup/salad. We came here during MTL a Table, so they were only doing that menu plus their tapas menu. We ordered something off the tapas menu as well and it never came. I figured it was taking a little longer than the rest of the food (although I don't really know how that would have been possible) and when the waitress came to our table to see if we were ready for desserts I asked about the tapas. She told me that because the item was not on the tapas menu, they would not be able to make it for me. It definitely was on the tapas menu, and I asked her to bring the menu over again so I could confirm, but if she thought they would not be able to make it why wouldn't she have said anything once she found out??? She never once came to our table to ask us how we were doing, we had to flag her over whenever we needed something. It was not busy at all either. There were maybe 5 tables total. She also never brought us a refill on water once we finished ours.  Anyway, the food was ok, but not good enough to make up for the poor service. I had the fish and chips--the portion was tiny and I've had better for cheaper. My boyfriend had the espresso burger which was unique and he enjoyed it, but agreed that it was not good enough for the quality of the service."}
{"text":"Terrible service, but I couldn't tell you about the food because we didn't end up receiving it. After waiting for over an hour and watching two tables who came 15 minutes after us receive their food first, we got up and left. They didn't keep us updated on the status of our food, nor did they come back to top us up on water during that time. Such a shame because we walked in the rain and our hotel recommended this place so we were very excited to give it a try. Very disappointing; not worth it, and we will not return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place used to be quite the thing in the neighborhood, but completely lost it recently. I heard that the former owners sold it to accountants and went on to open Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun.  I went recently, maybe mid october, and ordered the eggs benedict, as I always do, because they are amazing. Instead of the usual yumz, i was served two cold eggs drowned in a thick, cold lump of yellow sauce, along with cold potatoes and partially cooked bacon.  I sent the plate back, which I never do, mentionning that it was the first time I saw something like that at Griffintown Café, and that I would happily wait a bit longer for the real thing, and hot. What came back from the kitchen was the exact same plate, provably microwaved, with even more of the thick, disgusting sauce, and what appeared to be melted butter on the salad.   Puzzled, I decided not to eat anything because it was honestly disgusting. I politely complained about the quality of my meal, and was offered a groundbreaking 10% discount (\"the best we can do for you sir\"), for a meal I didn't even eat 10% of.   Needless to say, I won't be visiting again soon.   Anybody else has experienced a sharp decline in quality at GC?"}
{"text":"My favorite pick is Mac n' Cheese. I just love eating at this café on Thursday or Friday nights while listening to a groovy local jazz band.  Get ready to be surprised by the menu and the music. Warm soul food and  funky blues.  The best kept secret: if you stay late enough, the waitress becomes a sassy jazz singer.  Totally unexpected.    Tip:  Get there early (before 6 p.m.) because it  can get really crowded and finding a table becomes a skill.  The Griffintown café is not only good for eats, but its jazz concerts are a must.  Thank God the Griffintown café is in the area. It spices up the vibe in this upcoming *hot* hood for yuppies."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a late dinner before heading out for the night.  The place was full except for two places at the bar.  So we decided to stay and eat at the bar.  The decor had a very old time charm feel to it.  I am a sucker for the exposed brick and dated hardwood.  They had an upright bass and piano, which eventually was played by some musicians later in the evening.  The open kitchen is nice too because you can see the food being cooked.    I LOVE bourbon (having lived in Kentucky kinda forces you) and they had a very good selection (for Montreal standards) of bourbon.   I ordered the Griffintown cheeseburger, which is 1/2 beef, 1/4 duck and 1/4 lamb.  You can also have the option to add bacon.  It was really really good.  I tasted the lamb the most (I guess cause lamb is a really overpowering flavor...) but it was delicious nonetheless.  The mac and cheese looked good and I must try that next time.  The waitresses were pleasant and competent but the staff definitely had a hipster vibe to them.  My only concern was sitting so close to the kitchen caused our clothes to reek of pork...nothing a little cologne and fresh air couldn't fix..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp and went for brunch during a weekend trip to Montreal.  It was fantastic.  He ordered the huevos divorciados and I had the bacon egg mac & cheese.  Being from Texas, we were leery about ordering a Mexican inspired dish- but we were not disappointed!    The dishes came out piping hot- a very important factor for a delicious breakfast.  We ate at the bar and we spent a couple of hours lingering after our meal visiting with the staff, the chef and his wife.  We had plans to go visit a couple of museums but we ended up spending the entire afternoon just hanging out at Griffintown, a happy accident and a very memorable Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"The food was sub par. The potatoes that come with the brunch dishes leave much to be desired although the potatoes as a arose dish were obviously prepared separately and much better. The hollandaise sauce was tasteless and frothy and my friend agreed that the quality of the dishes has deteriorated. That said I liked their homemade biscuits and their frittata looked appetising."}
{"text":"The service can be hit or miss for lunch and they close fairly early on weekends-- but the brunch is undoubtedly delicious!  Make sure you reserve early as it books up days in advance."}
{"text":"We heard good things but was disappointed by the burger and the salad wayyyy too salty service had major deficiencies."}
{"text":"It feels like they're busting at the seems. The food, like the burger, is still good. But the service has become slower and the waitstaff seem more stressed. Plus, I can't believe that they haven't fixed the hood yet. We all smelt like greasy french fries when we got out of there. I've got mixed feelings about this place now."}
{"text":"Si la nourriture est excellente et que l'ambiance a plein de potentiel, il y a un travail à faire dans le service, la musique, le climat et l'attention aux détails."}
{"text":"We walked in, were directed to a table and waited for about 10 minutes before getting our menus. We placed our order. And waited. And waited. Finally, 45 minutes later, we caught the attention of the waitress who remembered us, walked over and told us the order hadn't gone through. No apologies. We decided to go somewhere else. Shit service."}
{"text":"We came here without reservations on a Sunday at 11:30, with a group of 7. Had to wait a little but the server was really sweet and funny and kept updating us on the timeline. Around 12 the place started to get really busy and was packed by the time we left.   They were accommodating to our requests and the food was great. I highly recommend the huevos divorciadas. Usually the corn tortilla is too crunchy or too thin and flimsy but these tasted like authentic yellow corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Two main things brought this review down:  1. Service: Waited over an hour for food. Waitress completely inattentive and did not offer any explanation as to why we hadn't received our food when tables around us had gotten theirs even though they arrived after our table.   2. Very moldy fruit on all four of our plates. No attempt made by service to correct this or offer compensation once they were notified.  It's too bad because the rest of the food and ambiance was nice and I want to like this place but it just let's me down every time."}
{"text":"Went for a brunch with a friend on a Saturday. Place was full but we found a table pretty quick. We both ordered the huevos divorciados with pulled pork (extra). Two poached eggs on corn tortillas with cheddar, chili and avocado. Was alright, lacked a bit of seasoning or something though.   I found a vegetable sticker in my meal and when I brought it up the waitress only apologized. Oh well not her fault. I just hope they wash their vegetables properly the next time they serve me if I come back."}
{"text":"Only been for lunch. Enjoyed the food and ambience. Can't wait to go for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Petit resto avec ambiance vraiment génial....Mais, vais-je repartir du métro Jarry pour y retourner ? Jamais dans 100 ans !  Service des plus ordinaire, nous avons eu le temps de voir nos cafés avant de voir le repas un peu trop tiède arriver.  Après avoir fini de manger, nous avons du nous habiller après 25 min sans avoir personne venir nous voir....pour ainsi avoir l'attention de la serveuse.  Et le comble, pendant que je m'habillais à ma place, le placier avait déjà envoyé un couple s'y asseoir.   Mon déjeuner canadien était-il bon ? Pas plus que ça ! J'ai demandé du prosciutto, mais il n'y en avait pas. Les toasts sur baguette de pain était trop dures et le bacon trop cuit."}
{"text":"Two years ago, I said that the brunch was excellent. Every time I come back I'm a little bit more disappointed by something. I'm at a point where I say it is just above average"}
{"text":"Taking a star away for the service. The girl at the door didnt really believe that i am joining existing party (my friends were already at the table), it takes ages to get waiting staff attention and when we were paying the waitress was taking payment on the credit card machine while ... kneeling next the table O_o  Also - only one barista? Espresso taking 15 minutes to make? Dear owners, during brunch people will ask for all those great coffees you have!  The interior design is great (apart from strange choice of radio (?) station), both food itself and presentation are good, well deserved \"well done\" to kitchen staff.  I will probably come back to try more things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Friends suggested meeting for brunch at Griffintown Cafe and we were not disappointed.  The wait staff were tremendous and actually let us in out of the cold a little before the restaurant opened.  We were there with an infant which tends to complicate things at most restaurants, but they were well set up and didn't give it a second thought.  We tried the bacon and eggs mac and cheese as well as the eggs benedict.  The mac and cheese was made with about 4 kinds of cheese and topped with their homemade bacon (which is amazing) and two perfectly poached eggs.  It was heavy, but delicious.  The eggs benedict was also incredible.  Not too much hollandaise and homemade bacon instead of ham.  The kicker was a homemade biscuit for the base.  It all came together very nicely.  Griffintown Cafe was very kid friendly with amazing food and excellent staff.  We couldn't have asked for a better brunch and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for dessert. It took 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. We end up ordering coffees and the brownie (since they only had that and a fruit crumble left). Brownie was all burnt and bitter. Not much to choose from for the dinner menu as well. Don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I went there last week for lunch and my bud was all stoked to have me try their vegie burger. I coulda had the salad, I guess - thought I would have had to have the one without bacon.  It's called Griffintown Café but they might as well call it Griffintown Bacon for the sheer amount of meat and particularly bacon that's on the menu. So yeah, I ordered the black-bean vegie burger and a bloody mary as a first even though that got me tons of wooo and haaa because for some reason it's borderline sacrilegious to have one boozy drink over lunch on a weekday here in North America even though elswhere in the world, it's really no big whoop.  But yeah, the drink was good. A nice tall glass of tomato juice with thick sea-salt crystals lining the rim. And get this - they stick a huge-ass marinated jalapeno pepper in it. Total win.  The vegie burger - somewhat less so. Bland-ish thick black-bean patty with half an avocado between an unremarkable, lightly toasted white bread bun. Oh hum. I went crazy with the salt trying to flavor it up. Unremarkable but well cooked home fries.  I had them at three points then I remembered the overwhelming smell of cooked meat (all that bacon does a number on this open-concept place) so they lost a point. But then they won it back cause of really rad 70s soul music they played all the way through."}
{"text":"Ambiance décontracté de jazz et nourriture excellente surtout pour le prix. Le service est ordinaire surtout considérant que jetais le seul client au moment de ma visite. De plus, j'ai trouve les chaises très inconfortables...  Tout de même, une bonne place a visiter... Je reviendrai probablement."}
{"text":"Terrible brunch place. The service was terrible. Walked in no one greeted us, after 5mins of standing in the entrance waitress told us to sit anywhere. We sat down at a table and waited another 15 minutes to get menus. The waiter then told us we didn't sit at the right place and that we should of waited for someone to seat us...once we ordered the wait was reasonable although we had all finished our plates before the waiter brought us our drinks. Terrible experience, terrible service. Many much better places in the area, don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork soft shell tacos and a drink menu full of bourbons and hints of the south, Griffintown Cafe is a nice quiet hangout for a mid day meal or a fun place at night that can sometimes be crowded. The simple dishes seem to have the most flavor! Now that I have found the pulled pork it will be hard for me to venture away from them! Mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Took a long time to get our food - and it was served cold and no flavor - don't get the 'Mexican dish' - whatever you do - service was alright - they did comp me my beer - will give them another try - pretty pricey - 30 bucks for Mac and cheese and a beer"}
{"text":"total let-down. waited over 30 minutes to sit down for brunch, to find out that apparently they were \"out of eggs benedict\". with pretty much no other veggie options on the menu, i had a grilled cheese sandwich.   doused in butter and skimpy on fillings, this was totally mediocre at best. there were probably 3 arugula leaves and 4 strands of pickled onions. 10 bucks.   won't be back. ignore the hype- for brunch anyway."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful, sunny, Saturday afternoon and my friend and I had decided to stroll on in here for brunch. We were seated instantly and chose to sit on the cute, little terrasse in the back. As soon as we got settled, we quickly searched through the menu with eyes wide open. I was instantly drawn to the wilted baby spinach & goat cheese eggs benny and I - was - pleased - as - ever.   The poached eggs weren't drenched in hollandaise sauce, so you were truly able to enjoy every single flavor from the top-down. The baby spinach wasn't overcooked and tasted fresh. The goat cheese, oh the goat cheese... how I love you so, adding so much vibrancy and umph to this glorious eggs benedict. It wasn't the cheap, tasteless kind. It was the best kind, the thick-creamy-sour kind that melts in your mouth. The biscuit at the bottom wasn't too dough-y. It was thin, had some crunch to it as though it had been toasted, and didn't steal the spotlight from the marvelous creation topping it, yet still left its mark.   I wished it wouldn't end, and made sure to savor every moment of every bite. Truly, scout's honor.  After such an outstanding food experience, the downfall was the service. Although our waitress was kind, it took 45 minutes to receive our order. Two or three tables before us got served even though they had arrived after us. After the long wait, our waitress brought us someone else's order, who also came in after us, and that just felt like such a harsh tease. About five minutes after that, she brought us what we had ordered after we reminded her, once again. Something definitely went wrong with our order, and it was really frustrating while waiting under the heat, on an empty stomach, and watching everyone else who came in later get to enjoy their meals first. However, once the plates were finally served, they were just too good to leave upset.   There are other plates I am curious to try, like the house cured wild salmon benny and the crab cakes and eggs. So I will definitely be back, and hopefully be more pleased with Griffintown's service."}
{"text":"A go to breakfast/brunch spot, with one of the best cappuccinos in town - don't add sugar.  But come hungry, cause the plates are plentiful.  The eggs benedict are great, and the mac and cheese lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Eat elsewhere. The service is horrible and the food just meh. I wish I could give it a half star."}
{"text":"The Griffintown Café is otherworldly. If the walls and floorboards could talk ... I'd know that I'm tripping balls on something and I'd sit back, relax and enjoy the show. This place is from a bygone era of two penny coffees and five-cent silken bow ties. Back in those days I'd pay a dollar seventy-five in rent every twelve to eighteen months for my 6 1/2 in Griffintown. The cinema cost a dime for a double feature and all the groceries you could eat for a month. Tuition at McGill and UdM combined was negative sixty-three dollars and eighteen cents for life! I had twenty-three children by the age of twenty-four and if I had a cough or a paper cut I'd have probably died of gangrene after a couple of agonising weeks. Okay but really get out of the Tardis and take off the Dr. Who get-up and come have a coffee and listen to some live Jazz. You may even get a story or two from the light fixtures if you're lucky enough."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday morning, great atmosphere and decor, about a 15 minute wait. Busy but not outrageously so.  The house juices are great. The Canadian breakfast was also very good, although the bacon was a little off, but vegetarians beware, there is no vegetarian option to replace the meat in most dishes other than \"more mixed greens,\" and even the breakfast potatoes are cooked in bacon fat."}
{"text":"Hands down the best crab cake I have ever experienced--watch out New England. How is this possible? Smoked jalapeño remoulade with pickled red onions...duh, heaven. Anywho, great local spot, pardon my lack of French proficiency, quaint and I loved the little Asian woman that sat next to me and voiced her discontent for the briefly screaming baby:   \"we had children and did not bring them out to ruin other peoples meals. People have pay money and that baby is causing people indigestion!\"  --priceless  You have to love a place that serves Manhattans before Noon!"}
{"text":"Known for its jazz themed nights, amazing décor, and novel food presentation, Griffintown café has made a name for itself. In fact, when we showed up we had to wait a little over 15 minutes to get a seat (you may want to consider reservations), since the place was jammed both inside and in the terrace out back. There is actually a bar section where we could have eaten but we chose to wait for a table. There was a also a piano where people where eating on as if was a table which I found to be pretty cool. When we got seated we got a nice table with these metal chair with really comfy pillows on them. The pillows almost made me fall asleep since you sink right into them. The entire place is relaxing, I mean, it has this nice old charm with warm red bricks on the wall and old hardwood floors that give it that comfy feeling. The menu is a one pager and has an interesting mix of classic breakfast dishes and more filling meal items that you would normally see at lunch. This would usually cause issues with me but the breakfast items had their spirit intact and any lunch like influences did not take away from the true nature of the dish. The menu price is a little more than what one would find at most spots. You will find lots of dishes in the $12 -$15 price range, although there are some lower cost items. I should also note that coffee is not free."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. They have a great menu, great service and a nice relaxing atmosphere. I usually get the omelette which is delicious. I stop here when I have time to kill; great chats with the staff and free wifi so I can work. Parking outside is free for an hour too."}
{"text":"ACCEPTABLE ... the interior is attractive and caught my eye in the past (this seems to be a common theme in my reviews). I had anticipated my experience here for quite a while having studied the menu while passing by on a couple of occasions. The menu offers a variety of \"standards\" as well as some smart variations of standards and interesting combinations. Somewhere between conception and execution of the plates something didn't work out. To elaborate, the meals were described accurately in terms of the actual ingredients and style of preparation, but somehow they read much more interestingly than they actually tasted, which was a little bland.  The overall quality of Griffintown Cafe would be comparable to dinning at a friend's house, a friend who cooks well but not quite at the caliber of a professional and lacking the soul of \"home cooking\". The restaurant almost plays into this a bit by mixing and matching plates and glasses and offering a back patio that feels very much more like a back porch (at a friend's house). The staff was very attentive and friendly. Based on the menu, they have creativity and potential and I think they'll improve their execution one day. For now I would recommend starting with a cocktail and small item to test the waters and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"A great place to chill and listen to some jazz while munching good food on a Friday night when you want to go out and haven't made reservations (since they don't take 'em). Arrive early in the evening or be prepared to wait for a table (ideally you can do so while sipping a drink at the bar). Their menu changes frequently, and has a southern influence. I really liked the lobster tacos. The whole place has a community vibe and the live music adds some real spirit. Sometimes the servers even join the band! I keep meaning to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Even the name is hipster...  Good fresh food, ordered the dinner special: $19 for \"Griffintown Burger\" (1/2 beef, 1/4 duck, 1/4 lamb) with a nicely done large side salad (Arugula Pesto with slices of radish), and accompanying stout.  Tastay.  Ambience was rustic chic - nice place for to catch up with buddies or for a simple date.  I could see how the atmosphere could lend itself to a relaxed brunch, which I will have to try next time.. if I'm ever back in Montreal..."}
{"text":"I have dined at this restaurant twice with friends and have mixed reviews about it. The first time was great, because I was taking advantage of the brunch special. Crispy french toast with cream cheese glaze, plus the eggs benedict that my friends share with me. They were all very tasty and came at a reasonable price of 12.50 with a coffee and potatoes. The decor is chic and the staff relaxed, perfect for dining in the morning. However, the next time I had gone for the dinner service, I thought the food was average for the price I was paying. Nearly 30 dollars for burger and fries and that did not include the alcohol. Every place out there is doing the gourmet burger concept and some restaurants need to step it up if they want to compete when it comes to pricing. Some of the items on the menu may not tingle my taste buds, but that does not mean that I won't go back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My friend talked up the Egg Mac and Cheese before we arrived at Griffintown for brunch and I say to myself, ok ok, I'm sure it's alright, I'll see what else is on the menu. Huevos Divorciados... that looks interesting...Eggs Norwegian... maybe...OK FINE, egg mac and cheeese it is.  Glad I got it! Absolutely fantastic. Totally hit the spot. This is not for the diet conscious.   Plus, everyone in the restaurant is beautiful!! Every.One. Customers and waitstaff. Maybe it's the lighting. I don't know. Go early for brunch, it gets crowded at primetime!"}
{"text":"Avec une atmosphère un peu british (et des serveurs qui parlent mal le français), vous aimerez bruncher souper à ce restaurant. Il y a même une terrasse à l'arrière lorsque vous voudrez prendre un peu l'air.   J'ai essayé le mexican breakfast, même si c'est british et je n'ai pas été déçu!"}
{"text":"Sign me up for a weekly eat here, please? Someone? Please. Arriving starved after a morning train ride from Ottawa, I was seated on the terrasse. Snuggly wedged into my seat (which was also propping open the door to the restaurant) I got down to brass tacts: bennies and bevies.   I ordered absolutely, positively correctly. The house cured wild salmon benny was a perfect blend of salty, sweet, pickled, and smoky flavour. And the mountain of potato mash with bites of onions? I could have easily eaten double!   Griffintown seems to be a restaurant that enjoys homemaking their wares. Much to my joyful surprise, they also had homemade ginger beer. And yes, it too was delicious.   I searched for something wrong with experience, but truthfully, it was just a big breakfast-at-lunch-time love fest."}
{"text":"Went there around 1:15 PM on Sunday. We had to wait over 45 minutes to get our food which was cold and tasteless. The only thing that makes me give that restaurant a second star is the friendly waitress and because they offered us a drink and didn't charge for the coffees because we had to wait for so long."}
{"text":"It's my 4th time having brunch here and I remember the breakfast burger used to be the bomb. So this time me and my buddy both ordered the breakfast burger. Midway through, my buddy noticed his patty is not completely cooked. Took us a while to actually get the waitress's attention and we were just wondering if its normal for a burger's patty here half cooked. She replied like ohh its fine and if you want, I can bring your dish back and heat it for you. Hmmm we weren't sure how to decipher statement as she's gonna microwave that half-eaten burger or what. Anyway we didn't ask to bring the dish back because the burger wasn't that great anymore :(((("}
{"text":"I hope it was an exceptionally terrible day for Griffintown Cafe, as the experience we had here was definitely exceptionally terrible. I usually get very excited for brunch, so I'm much more forgiving of mishaps. The cafe is cute enough for a brunch place with a kind of rustic, bright ambiance with an open kitchen, high ceilings and a back porch.   The service was satisfactory to begin with; orders given, they ran out of some dishes.    A pregnant member of our party requested her eggs be 'well done'.   Two hours later, we received our orders. 1-2 requests for water went unfulfilled. My eggs benedict was terrible. The hollandaise sauce tasted of mayonnaise. The toast was burned and the request for 'well done' eggs came back over easy.   How do you mess up eggs? Griffintown knows the answer. No apologies were given for our LOTR-esque epic-length wait and moreover the service was brusque."}
{"text":"We were trying to visit Duo.D next door, but turns out they're closed for lunch. So we ate ate Griffintown instead. Pretty amazing consolation prize.   There were three of us; I had the veggie burger, which was actually really good and flavorful. By far the most flavorful veggie burger I've ever had. My husband had the daily special, which was an oven fried chicken, which was also really good. Their food is seasoned really well without being overpowering. Our friend got the burger (maybe it was called the Griffinburger or something like that), which he said was amazing; part lamb, part beef, part duck. We also shared the mac and cheese, which was really good: it wasn't overly cheesy or heavy, so it didn't give you the gross yuck feeling afterwards.  We wanted to go here again for lunch, but they are closed on Mondays, so be aware of that!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this amazing restaurant through Yelp when on vacation with the (now ex) boyfriend! It was our brunch every day for the long weekend we were there :) I would definitely go back in a heart beat!  I recommend trying the eggs bene! mmmm!"}
{"text":"Was turned down at 2pm yesterday, hostess had told us they stopped serving/accepting customers for their brunch at 3, which was reasonable. Came again today around 1230 expected to be seated and was turned down for service once more! Another couple ahead of us were also turned down and told the same thing, only to have seen the hostess seat another group shortly thereafter! Not sure what kind of business this place is running, but this will be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite or just to hang out and listen to the live jazz."}
{"text":"Never again. Straight up, you can cook better food at home I promise. Even if that means making a cup of ramen. Yes. Unfortunate. The food is bland, lackluster and there's just no love. They don't seem to care about what's on the plate. I'm pretty sure my salad was one of those premixed deals from a plastic bag. The homemade lox was okay. Honestly, it was pretty tasteless and forgettable. Ah, this is so harsh! The place was busy so it was likely an area favourite but this could also be because there's not much choice around. Otherwise, the interior is cute and quaint. There's a TV on the wall playing local television. Dear management, get rid of that."}
{"text":"Played a gig here recently. Clearly the gentrifiers are here to stay in G-town, if this place can stay in business charging $14 for a reuben before tax and tip. It was actually a fantastic sandwich, and it looks like they pickle the cabbage in-house, but it wasn't THAT big, and no sides or anything, so I have some trouble seeing how it adds up. Great vibe, though. Interesting selection of beers on tap. The staff was very cool. We stretched the musician accommodations to the breaking point (there isn't much space) but I had no complaints about how they treated us. Just came off a little haughty with the pricing."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot in Montreal. No lineups, spacious & most importantly DELICIOUS! I ordered the crab cakes with eggs, oh so good! My friends ordered the Mexican dish and eggs benedicts, their verdicts, excellent!"}
{"text":"Brunch menu is absolutely fantastic. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with mushrooms and cheddar. The eggs were perfect and re sauce was not drowning the eggs like most places. What I found different was the bun.. Amazing flavour almost felt like corn bread. I will ask next time I go back, and I will. My friend had the french toast and found it amazing so that's my next choice. The texture was crispy and moist.   The location is right in heart of Griffintown and had no trouble finding parking.   I recommend making a reservation before.   Service was a little slow but once you start eating all is forgotten!"}
{"text":"I use to really enjoy this place. Nice crowd and atmosphere.   Sadly breakfast has been really deceiving lately. Not the standard we have become used to in a Montreal restaurant. The hollandaise on the eggs benedicts is frothy, thin and tasteless.   Hopefully things can turn around and get back to the way it use to be.. Great casual food."}
{"text":"In Montreal it seems to be normal to charge good money for mediocre to poisonous food. We're it not for my favourite cheap and cheerfuls (Thali, Thai Express and a few others) I would never eat out at all.  This evening a friend of mine wanted to go for a bite, I was really just looking for a coffee while he ate. We ended up at the Griffintown, because it was close and looked reasonably appealing.  Once seated I checked out the menu, and though I wasn't hungry I saw Pulled Pork Tacos and couldn't resist. Now -- I should know better, as there is one thing you can be sure of -- no one in Montreal actually knows how to cook, much less something as tasty as pulled pork.  My pal ordered a burger, and when he specified no bacon, what do you know he got bacon -- STRIKE 1  My Pulled Pork arrived, and it was cold: trichinosis anyone??? STRIKE 2 I sent it back, and at that moment I realized that Griffintown was another over-hyped, under serving restaurant.  I didn't want anything else to eat, as god knows what goes on in that kitchen, but making food is obviously not their forte.  The final strike was the out of tune, bad sounding piano, being beaten by some woman who required sheet music to play old standards, and her accompanist, a microphoned double bass.  Would I go there again?? BZZZT   The only saving grace was they comp'd our meal. Which when you think about it, thats about what it was worth -- nothing."}
{"text":"Stopped in near the end of lunch. Ordered the sandwich of the day which was a salmon gravlax. Absolutely delicious. The sandwich was available with a salad for $8 or with the soup of the day and coffee for $14. When the waitress asked if I would like it with the soup, I declined. When I went to pay, I was charged for the lunch special (with the soup). There was no miscommunication as my server was the only staff that day, and I began to explain that I had only asked for the sandwich and had specifically declined the soup. She responded that the soup was swapped for a salad as if I hadn't been able to read on the menu that the salad was included in the $8 price. I didn't bother arguing with her as it obviously wouldn't have been to any avail. Delicious food and great atmosphere, but overcharging me, not knowing your menu, and not offering me even the coffee that you're forcefully charging me as I enjoy my meal, not acceptable. I will certainly go back  to enjoy the delicious food and hope to be able to update my review with improved service."}
{"text":"Attempted to Griffintown Café today but due to short staff or poor administration, I cant even give this place a star because we never made it in. We were 2, and when we got there, there were 6 free tables. We stood there for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to seat us. All the while noticing that the people who were seated all had their menus and were looking annoyed like they hadn't been served yet. Then all of a sudden the party of 4 standing behind us somehow gets seated and the waitress doesn't say anything to us. We wait another 10 or so minutes and the people who we initially saw seated with menus had still not been served. At this point we waited another 5 minutes (still not seated despite the 6 free tables) and then just decided it would probably be an hour or so until we actually ate if we stayed there so we went elsewhere. WTF? I can understand if the place is brimming to full capacity but when you have 6 open tables and you can't manage to seat the few people at the door and serve the customers that are already seated there are major issues.  Sorry not going back."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Go there often with my colleagues. It's chic and the menu is simple. They have special lunches which are quite cost-efficient.  The portions are perfect. You feel satiated and not over-eaten and most of all, healthy! I've always had a lovely enjoyable time there..  Waitress could be a bit distracted since the place is busy and you might have to remind/ask her to come over but it's not out of negligence.  Enjoyed the ginger beer, tea was the four o'clock brand for earl grey which I very much like! :) Croque-monsieur had a bit too much of prosciutto but the best part of it was the crumbly bread!! The salad complimented that perfectly! Gazpacho was said to have included melon but didn't taste a bit of it. Just tasted of tomato, cucumber, garlic and oil. Not toooo refreshing for the weather, unfortunately. It was only a little pleasant.  Overall, if you're in the area looking for a place to eat, consider this. I would travel a lot just to eat here though."}
{"text":"I don't mean to bump Crystal's review - but we LOVED this place! We love the food, the service. Cannot wait to return again! This is an amazing gem we discovered through yelp in Montreal!  Good for groups: if you sit inside. It is a small quaint gastropub.  Dinner: I ate the Griffintown Cheeseburger which is a delicious monster  Brunch: Crab Cakes with Eggs = divine!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Caesar in Montreal!!  Yes we were visiting but we had many in different cafes and restaurants. We could have drank 20... did we.. who knows?  Breakfast was good. I tried the homemade gravlax and yes!! so good with my poached eggs. Egg sandwich  The scene cool, hip and mellow. The background music was wonderful. Loved it. I also liked the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday at 2pm for brunch. We had reserved but because of the weather it was still empyish.   Great little place, nice rustic decor, friendly staff, really great eggs benedict and mimosas. We had a really nice couple of hours. It was a tad on the pricey side, but overall it could be argued that it's worth it.   It also seemed like it was a good spot to come in the evenings. Jazz music was listed for the weekends. Might go back to check that out.  Only downside with this place is that it's a little awkward to get to if you don't have a car. But I would argue that it's worth it. I live in NDG, and there are half a dozen other brunch places around here on Monkland etc. I would make this trek rather than go to any of those places anytime. If you wanna \"do brunch\" and don't mind spending a little, definitely go here."}
{"text":"As I read previous reviews for this place, it's pretty clear that some people love this place and others hate it. Now I can't speak for them but having gone there for the first time this past Saturday for brunch with the family, we had a warm and welcoming experience!   It's worth noting that the menu isn't very extensive, boasting at most 8-10 options. Being 8 people we tried the crab cake, morning burger, and eggs Benedict with pulled pork among other things. The food here and especially the coffee is extremely good, and rightly so considering you're paying well over average prices. The service was pretty good too but then again it wasn't too busy when we went so that was expected   The place itself is nice inside and comfortable, I do however have to criticize the prices as being simply too high considering other brunch restaurants with superior food and a better reputation charge less  Giving it 3.5 stars on 5, worth trying for its simple yet tasty menu."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for breakfast and once in the evening, so I'll split the review in to two:   Breakfast - while there's always a line up, it's well worth the wait.   The place is noisy, but that's just because it's one big space (including all the seating, the bar, and the kitchen) and popular. I don't find it a problem, but if you want a quiet spot to escape the noise, then you don't want to come here.  While you're waiting for a table, try to squeeze in at the bar to order a coffee (it's really good here) - it makes the wait that much more bearable.  The G Biscuit with bacon is my favourite savoury meal - it's not too big, super tasty, and cooked to perfection. On the sweet side I really like their french toast - nothing too crazy, just solid french toast goodness.  Evening - much more chillaxed. I had the burger and pint Wednesday special for $18, and wasn't disappointed. The burger patty is a mix of beef, lamb, and duck, and tastes as good as it sounds! I can't remember what beer they have on tap, but it's good."}
{"text":"Also taking two stars because of the service. The food is good and the place is cozy and nice during winter or summer. But the service is always incredible slow! It takes a lot of time to get simple refular coffee after you order it. It doesn't matter if it's busy or not. Even beer takes too long to arrive. Same goes for the check. I like it here, but the slow service always makes m rethink the idea of coming."}
{"text":"I've been to Griffintown 3 times now and I have to admit it keeps getting better each time I go.  The first time I went was for breakfast this summer and to be honest I was a little disappointed with the service, that being said I think they were going through some growing pains because as I later found out the poor service wasn't the staffs fault but a computer glitch that had wiped out all the mornings orders.   The second and third time I went were awesome, the problems had all been addressed and the staff has found their groove. The service was impeccable, even on Friday night when the place was full and we had to wait, they made us feel at home and worked very hard to get us a table as quickly as possible.  I love the open kitchen that allows you to see whats going on and the activity in the kitchen adds to the general ambiance. They also had great jazz band playing the evening I was there, adding even more to the ambiance. Breakfast at Griffintown is as enjoyable as dinner the cafe au lait is good and the brioche french toast is just awesome as are the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon.   This has definitely become one of my favourite places, it a nice restaurant with a nice neighbourhood feel. The beef, Lamb and duck burger is one of the best in the city. I hope you enjoy."}
{"text":"Was there for brunch. Really disappointed by the service which obviously doesn't care about their own business and about you... which is kind of the basis. Food was good, a 5/10."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't quite deliver. Although the set up is cute, the food is just ok - I can think of more than 10 better brunches for the same price or cheaper. The biggest problem, however, is very poor service. The waitress took our order with other clients' empty plates in her hands. Coffee and juice took too long to arrive. Sadly, not worth waiting 20 min for."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a recent girls' trip to Montreal.  It was very close to the condo where we were staying.  Arrived around noon on a Saturday afternoon and to our surprise, no line up!  Service was quick and friendly.  We ordered the eggs benny with homemade bacon ($12) and it came with a side of potatoes and green salad.  Other orders included the crab cakes and French Toast.  Everything was super tasty and prices very, very reasonable for brunch.  They don't have regular drip coffee but the Americano was great.  Loved the laid back vibe of the place.  Would gladly come back for brunch again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Where should i begin, hard to say.  I think i should begin by the good. Quite obviously the neighbourhood is looking for a place like this. Serving non pretentious food, with a relaxed home-y atmosphere, and friendly staff. We came to eat brunch today, and the first thing i noticed was the line up at the door, a tell tale sign of something there a need for.  Though having a line up, a relaxed atmosphere and a nice setting gets you a line up, it doesn't guarantee you repeat and loyal customers.  At this point of my review if you are the owner/operator, or employee, you might be saying to yourself \" What basis does this customer have to offer any criticism towards my restaurant\". Let me answer that by saying i have been working in the restaurant/hotel industry for the last 15yrs, and i have seen the good, and the bad. your establishment falls somewhere in-between.  Now on with the not so good.  Please take this as constructive, and nothing else. I am not here to bash. i am writing this in the hopes that this might help your restaurant/cafe have a long fruitful life.  The seating process was dealt with nicely, we were promptly seated, with a sense of urgency. The table layout was a bit confusing, it didn't look well organized. I understand wanting the maximum of seated clients at one time, but if the staff could not handle that many seated, you should remove a few tables, and encourage more tales being turned over.  Our waitress took our coffee order after 10mins of being seated, this should be something that's delay with as soon as the client is seated, thus minimizing the perception of waiting times. Also let me say that a table just wanting a simple filter coffee doesn't want to wait 10 mins to get an alongee. With a minimum investment for a drip coffee machine you could satisfy these clients.  After our order was taken, i noticed the dishwasher with a cigarette (non lit) in his mouth in the kitchen area. This should not be permitted near or around the food. Lit or Not!   During the wait time for our food (approx. 30mins) i noticed our waitress chatting with a friend at the bar, and walking around aimlessly with no sense of urgency. i saw some of her tables have to get up walk to the back and pay at the cash, instead of at the table because of this. Though the other waitresses looked like they were bustling, maybe we just got unlucky with our pick.  When the food arrived it was good, the only thing not excusable was the burnt potatoes on the Fritata dish, not slightly burnt they were petrified, and non edible.  The advice i could offer to shorten wait times for the food would be. Either invest some money into more updated kitchen equipment, or construct a new condensed menu to handle the kitchens abilities. I noticed the staff is working off an old 6 burner stove, with 3 of these burner being taken up by a make shift steam table, this leaves 3 burners for everything else. This cannot suffice to feed a full restaurant in a reasonable amount of delay.  Now let me finish by saying congratulations! To own a business where there is a line up out the door for there offering is \"the dream\" for any owner/operator. I hate to say it though if some things are not adjusted and or invested. That line up could dwindle away quickly.   We will be back to eat eventually,and i hope to see the line up twice as long and i hope to be waiting in it to be seated again.  Regards"}
{"text":"I am calling this the best brunch in Montreal!  Because we wanted to explore this neighborhood by day, we decided to venture out for a Saturday Brunch at Griffintown Cafe.  We did not realize we would discover the best brunch in Montreal!  This is what we ate:  Mimosa Griffintown What is a brunch without mimosa?!  This mimosa is made from McKeown Cider which is from Quebec's own McKeown orchards.  Go ahead and have two or three; it is the perfect way to start off your brunch!  Crab Cakes Why--you might ask--did we decide to have crab cakes for brunch?  Well they do come with eggs and bacon so why not?!  Very delicious  Mac & Cheese Again, you might ask why this for brunch?  They put egg--poached egg--and bacon on this too so it counts!  We ordered two of these!  The Breakfast \"Griffintown\" Burger This time we had to ask them to hold the egg.  We just couldn't get down with the egg on the burger!  There is already a lot going on with the meat.  The \"Griffintown Burger\" is 1/2 beef, 1/4 duck, 1/4 lamb and is darn good.  It also has aged cheddar and if you are so daring you can add the sunny side egg.  Everyone has to get this just to try it.  Even if you can't eat the whole thing, you have to try it.  Brioche French Toast For those of you looking for basic breakfast brunch items then look no further because the Brioche French Toast is all you need!  \"Bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, sweet cream, maple syrup and fresh fruit\" create the perfect french toast.  Griffintown Cafe is a fantastic place to have weekend brunch.  The staff is extremely friendly and the crowd is pleasant.  We agreed that we would be sure to add Griffintown Cafe to our \"must visit\" list for all future trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Had to ask for service twice.  35 mins to get some eggs.  Then had to get up to ask for the bill. And there was maybe 30% capacity filled.   Eggs Benedict they don't heat up or toast the bread so it's mushy.  Orange juice is not fresh.  The salad was very tasty and the burger had good flavor but again the bun was cold.  Not worth it unfortunately.  The atmosphere could be great if they had someone running the place that was experienced.  It has tons of potential. Tons.  Too bad. Great location. Wish it was better."}
{"text":"Granola Sheik            You know what I mean? Like, the kind of people that buy hemp sandals, not make hemp sandals. This is the crowd at Cafe Griffintown. None the less, the food is spot on.            I've only been for brunch but have tried everything on that menu. Huevos Divorcidos has taught me the best part of marriage is the end of it. Le Cauchon showed me that three different kinds of pig with a fried egg and a great bun, will induce sleep. And through crab cakes I have taken in that...well...crab cakes for breakfast are bitchen'.        Service is always great. The waitresses are both pleasant and pretty, not necessarily in that order and the music is feckin' awesome. From saloon piano to jazz, it adds to the great ambience and relaxed decor.           My only complaint is this, they sell Benedicts like the English military and I find the Hollandaise gets a little runny the later you go. It doesn't have that nice, rich, nappe consistency...but such is life and I don't bitch. I just get the Breakfast Burger, which consists of beef, duck and lamb, burger accoutrements and yes.... a fuckin' fried egg. Last but not least, the biscuits are like edible pillows of delicious.         You best make a res if you are going for a late breakfast or be prepared to have a few cocktails, their brunch is quite busy and rightfully so.  I will try dinner soon enough.  waka waka"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Food was OK but be prepared to wait before it arrived. Nice service, so overall it's ok."}
{"text":"Très belle place dans un quartier très charmant. Non loin du métro et du Canal de Lachine. Serveur très agréable et patient. La qualité et la quantité sont au rendez vous. Posséder une terrasse à l'avant et à l'arrière du café."}
{"text":"I've been to griffintown cafe a few times and every time the service is terrible, however the food is quite good. The incredibly slow service by their waitresses makes the experience difficult to enjoy. This morning we passed by for brunch and ordered breakfast (eggs and toast) and waited over an hour for our food. We asked the waitress several times where our order was and kept saying it was coming. The food never arrived and we finally decided enough was enough and left. Not only did they lose the sale (50$) but we're never going to return to the restaurant. I hope future customers don't have to go through this and avoid this place, there are dozens of other restaurants in griffintown with better food and service"}
{"text":"Sur la rue Notre-Dame, dans le passé, il y avait Café Griffintown et Griffintown Café. Un peu mélangeant non? En fin de semaine, je me suis finalement rendue à la bonne place pour le brunch avec un ami qui visitait pour un 24 heures rapide dans notre belle ville. Dès qu'on y est entré, l'ambiance m'a tout de suite fait dire \"on est à la bonne place cette fois-ci.\" Le restaurant étant rempli à craquer mais nous avons quand même attendu avec de délicieux lattes. En regardant le menu des cocktails matinaux, je me suis promise de ne pas conduire à ma prochaine visite. Des mimosas de toute sortes, un Bloody Ceasar et un \"hair of the dog\" complet avec un oeuf, une bière et du jus de tomate figurent aux menu. Personnellement, j'avais envi d'essayer le mimosa Griffintown, un verre de cidre et de jus d'orange. La prochain fois....parce qu'il y en aura sûrement plusieurs!  Nous nous sommes assit au bar dès que des places se sont libérées et c'était un bon endroit pour continuer de voir ce qu'il se passait autour de nous et espionner les plats qui sortaient de la cuisine. Pour le repas, nous avons pris un BLT, quelques G-biscuits, du pain doré et une salade. Dès que nos assiettes sont arrivées, plus aucun mot ne s'est fait entendre jusqu'à ce qu'elles soient vides à part pour quelques \"Je peux essayer ça?\" et \"Mmmm, c'est vraiment bon!\"  Puis, pour ce qui est du service, il est excellent. Les serveurs sont rapides, courtois, gentils et souriants. On donne l'impression de vous connaître depuis un bout et on se sent rapidement chez soit, presque comme si on est un client régulier du café. Il y avait aussi beaucoup de jeunes familles sans qu'on se sente dans un restaurant hyper familial. Il y a un espèce d'équilibre qui rend l'endroit très charmant, résonnant d'énergie et chaleureux."}
{"text":"I'm a simple breakfast person, eggs potatoes, and they did not master that dish,  the gang we were with loved their dishes though. Therefore if chi chi lala is your type of breakfast then this is for  you."}
{"text":"For the first time in a long while, I went to brunch where the choice of location wasn't made by me. As one starts to become known within his friend circle as the \"restaurant guy\", usually I am the one tasked with the selection. Not this time around as a couple of friends decided it was time that I tried a favourite of theirs closed to their neighbourhood (and one I actually have had on my list for some time), Cafe Griffintown.  Located on Notre-Dame street just off de la Montagne, this cafe has just a beautiful space to work with. High ceilings, exposed brick walls, beautiful aged wood floors, metallic accents with an open kitchen and a terrasse to boot, I love pretty much everything about this space. Add some great jazz and big band music in the background and you have a cafe that I could spend hours at.  But enough about the interior design, you want to hear about the food because frankly this is a food blog after all. The brunch menu is one of breakfast classics with some unique twists as well. To start, I ordered a glass of their \"Palm Spring\" - a mixture of fresh papaya, banana and pineapple juice. Great balance to this juice - not too sweet, not too sour, just a nice refreshing drink on a warm summer day.  As a main, I went for the crab cake and eggs. Homemade crab cake with sunnyside-up eggs, a side of bacon, a smoked and marinated jalapeños remoulade and a fresh salad. The crab cake was nice and dense with crab meat - no excessive binder here. The bacon was cooked as I like it - not crispy and the eggs were cooked as listed. The remoulade was not nearly as spicy as I expected (which for me is a good thing) and provided a nice tang to the dish. The only miss for me was the salad as it really didn't have a reason other than to make the plate seem larger. No dressing to really speak of and the lettuce honestly didn't seem all that fresh. If we ignore the salad, the rest of the plate is a winner.  One of my friends went with the Mac &amp; Cheese - L'Ile-aux-Grues, Swiss gruyere, Bierbrier beer with a side of bacon, poached eggs and some greens. The poached eggs were well done, the bacon was cooked the same way as mine was and the macaroni had great flavour. Both cheeses and the beer used in the Mac &amp; Cheese added a nice creamy sharpness to the dish but not one that would feel overbearing and heavy towards the end. The greens used here also seemed fresher. A very nice dish that I definitely would want to try next time as my own main.  My other friend went with their Canadian breakfast - 2 eggs your way with a side of meat (chorizo, bacon or prosciutto), potatoes, toast and a green salad. The eggs (scrambled in this case) were solid, the potatoes had good flavour and the bacon was cooked as the previous 2 dishes had been. The green salad was actually like mine which was disappointing but the real star here was the bread. Nice thick cut pieces of fresh bread grilled well and buttered. Every time I get bread like this in a restaurant I am reminded of my desire to bake my own sourdough bread. I definitely need to get on that. Anyway, solid dish apart from the salad once again.  After our meal, we sat there for another hour so clearly we felt right at home in this cafe. What can I say... my friends make good restaurant choices. I taught them well. Just kidding. Anyway, they were spot-on with this choice and it led to a great Sunday brunch. People in the Sud-Ouest region either living there or visiting, look no further than Cafe Griffintown for all your brunch needs. I only wish the live Jazz they have during the week was also there during Brunch. Then we would have probably stayed there a few more hours.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Griffintown this place has a lot going for it. Cool decor, chill vibe, live jazz on certain nights, open concept kitchen so you can see what's going on, good comfort food style  eats. Seating is a bit cramped but perfect if you're looking for a smaller or more intimate venue. Menu is awesome - lots of options good for sharing or single share sampling. Drink selection seems decent service was courteous but not overly friendly, prompt and helpful with navigating the menu options. Cool spot, really glad I ventured into this neighborhood, and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Quelle déception, première et dernière fois ici. Brunch de qualité très discutable, nombreux items non disponibles sur le menu. Une place à ne pas recommander."}
{"text":"Ok, I only had a dessert and a cup of coffee, so I can't say anything about the food.  First off, the place has a great decoration. (But seriously, you hung a TV into this rustic/industrial place)  The coffee: I understand that people come here for food not for coffee, but why don't places invest in some good beans and make the experience complete. Nobody wants to drink burnt coffee after a tasty brunch, do they?   The dessert was pretty good, but the sliced apples had onion taste in them. I mean even I clean/change my knife at home switching between those things. C'mon.  Overall, good service, nice interior."}
