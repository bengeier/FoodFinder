{"text":"Very overpriced and you can find most items at grocery stores! The owner is not friendly. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and am very pleased. Yes some of the prices seem high, but a good majority of the food is made from scratch. There is a very good selection of food and some items that I haven't been able to find in an everyday grocery store.  The ladies working tonight were amazing and very personable. I had a sample of their in-house baked banana bread and it was very good. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It's a decent variety of gluten-free items, which is great (including some things I've never seen elsewhere, like GF perogies!) but it's REALLY overpriced. For instance, a 4-pack of Udi bagels is 8.99 here, vs. 5.99 at Sobey's or Metro. They have some items made fresh on-site, but they're also quite expensive. One nice thing is they have many baked goods, etc. available for order, so for someone who needs to order a cake or meal and be guaranteed it's gluten-free, it might be worth it.  There's a good amount of parking in the area, though the storefront is a little obscured and it can be easy to miss."}
{"text":"This place is great!  They have a large variety of gluten free products.  I came here to purchase gluten free gnocchi because I haven't been able to find it anywhere.  They had two different types to choose from and the gnocchi I purchased was scrumptious.  Compared to most gluten free products, their prices are a bit high and the location isn't super convenient for me.  In those times when I really want something I can't buy anywhere else, I will definitely go back to buy those items."}
{"text":"The place has a decent selection of gluten free stuff, though very overpriced. Things are way more expensive here than at Metro.  The female owner is cantankerous and EXTREMELY rude. I felt as though my being there was a burden on her. Almost as if to say, \"How dare you be purchasing my foodstuffs?\" (I went in a few times [10+] and this occurred every single time she was there. I understand people have bad days, but leave it outside of the business.)  The other staff is pretty friendly. Though an experience a few weeks ago turned me off from this store completely.  All of the hot food (decent but not great) is sold by weight. They weigh the food in the to go container, subtract the weight of the container, heat it up if you ask for it, then return the food to the to go container. The employee helping me this day, weighed the food with the container and did not subtract the container's weight. Then when returning the food to the container spilled some of the food on the counter and rightfully didn't put it back. When I pointed both of these things out I was accused of being cheap. If you're going to sell food by weight, do it right. Not to mention that the prepared food, like everything else in the store, is extremely expensive.  Shape up the attitude, drop the prices a smidgen, and this might be a great place."}
{"text":"Review is based only on trying chocolate banana cake and vegan chocolate cupcakes. Both were moist, rich and delicious! Highly recommend - they don't use soy as a filler which is often the case with vegan chocolate baked goods. I plan to try other items they sell soon. I'll be sure to add those to my review."}
{"text":"Read an article online about this being the best gluten-free shop in Toronto. Not sure if I agree. They definitely have some interesting items like vegan, gluten free breads that I haven't really seen anywhere else. The store is much smaller than I thought it would be (based on what their website says). When I read their description of prepared foods and items in-store I was really excited about the variety. But once I found the store (which is hidden if you don't pay attention), I was disappointed.   A lot of the other items they carry on the shelf can be found in various stores around Toronto at a way cheaper price too.  If you are in the neighbourhood, do go in and browse. Otherwise not really worth the drive up there."}
