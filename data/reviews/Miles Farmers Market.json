{"text":"I bought peaches here on Friday and had to throw them away on Monday because they had white fuzz growing on them. Last time shopping there. Plus the staff was very rude"}
{"text":"The store is really packed at all times the produce is nice and the selection is great the prices are a little expensive but the employees are nice."}
{"text":"A great place to shop at!They even had floridenci blue cheese at one time."}
{"text":"A very nice Grocery store, they have a great selection of all items, it is always busy!"}
{"text":"I must admit, I heard about this place way before finally visiting, which was a couple of years ago.  In a nutshell, I've been here about five times total.  I think it's fantastic.  Admittedly, I touch pricey, and I mean only a touch, but you get what you pay for.  I love coming here, and love the pizzas and deli, especially the cheeses.  I could go on and on, but suffice to say I don't regularly shop here for everything, but I do come here for really good vegetables, cheese, meat and of course, the PIZZA.  Highly recommend it, and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Over priced and owner is rude...a lot of hype about nothing. ..Trader Joe's is much better"}
{"text":"oh i love shopping here.  i only wish i lived a little closer so i could go more often.  the first time i visited was to track down some jeni's ice cream.  at the time it was the only place to find it outside of columbus.  they still carry lots of flavors as well as some of the best prepared food items ever.  i always look for veggie sushi (made there"}
{"text":"Miles Farmers Market is the BEST because:   1. It has the best selection of produce I have ever seen. They also do not put out any damaged or tainted items, so everything you see is picture perfect!!   2. They have FANTASTIC employees who constantly refill the shelves and who are knowledgeable about the products   3. They have many rare or hard to find fruits and veggies that are not carried in the grocery store. Their prices are reasonable on these items too.   4. Over the years Miles has expanded from a produce market to a specialty store for cheeses, wines, pastas, jams/jellies, mustard's etc. They have several aisles of items that are unique and several items native to Ohio.   5. Their deli and butcher counter is packed with everything and anything you could want and will be cut just as you order it. They also have tons of ready made sandwiches and salads.   6. Their PIES are fabulous!! Everything in their bakery is awesome, but their pies are soooooo good ( and I am not really a pie person). They have delicious breads and rolls that are being made round the clock too.   7. Miles is a great place to come if you are preparing for a party,. They have it all, and also can make party trays with their meats, cheese, fruits and veggies. I have had all of their party trays and they are beautiful and delicious. They also do dessert trays......... scrumptious!   8. The market is clean, organized and full of happy, helpful people!!   9. This is a reasonably prices market. I would go here instead of the grocery store, any day"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We always make a stop when in town visiting my dad.  It is a local version of Whole Foods but better, with an in-house bakery, prepared foods, hard to find produce items.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here for lunch very often, and their variety of prepared foods is huge - sushi, salads, sandwiches, fried chicken, burgers, potatoes, soup, as well as a few special hot items every day and plenty of food that just need microwaving. I'm also a particular fan of their cheese section; it's unique and fun with a lot of options you wouldn't get at a normal grocery store. They have a cute beer and wine selection and lots of fresh produce.  The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the speed of the prepared foods (you'll be waiting a while if you're ordering a burger) and the navigation of the store. Because it's very popular with an older crowd, it can get really difficult to navigate, especially when you're someone like me on a lunch break trying to get in and get out.  There's also outdoor patio seating which is nice, especially in the summers when they have weekly grill-outs and sell burgers for a great price that you can eat in the sun."}
{"text":"Went to Miles for the fourth time last week.  I made the trip because they have awesome produce.  Great selection, best prices, everything is fresh.  I also like their selection of deli salads and prepared foods.  The free coffee is a nice touch.  Don't expect to do all your regular grocery shopping here.  It's just not that kind of place.  I was hoping to pick up some Amir's hummus, but was surprised to see they don't carry it.  The whole \"no carts in the parking lot\" thing is really annoying, but since I only shop here a few times a year, I'll put up with it.    I got some \"healthy Carolina bean salad\" from the deli the first time I visited, and have been on the lookout for it ever since.  They had some this time in the prepared foods, but not in the deli.  The woman giving samples warned me that it's not exactly the same recipe they use when making it for the deli.  Weird.  I bought some anyway, and it's definitely not as good.  Why give it the same name if it's not the same thing?  She made it sound like they still use the other recipe for the deli salad, so it's not just a recipe change.  The good news is if you know when you're going to be doing your shopping,  you can call and request things from the deli in advance.    I also bought a pack of their orange cranberry muffins, and everyone said they were some of the best muffins they've ever had.  Very moist."}
{"text":"Great selection of fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, bread, you name it.  There are even lesser-known items like pole beans.  Yep, pole beans.  What the hell is a pole bean you ask?  It's a larger and flatter green bean.  But don't ask me what they taste like because I have no idea...this place is jammed on a Sunday afternoon so consider shopping at off-peak times.  Shopping here makes you feel better about supporting smaller producers."}
{"text":"Really fresh produce and meat.  Down home, no chain here.  Nice baked goods too.  Only criticism is that the strawberries are almost always on their last leg.  But then Giant Eagles are the same....Good Customer service and carry out.  Remember the days when the rest of the grocers used to carry your groceries to the car ?...."}
{"text":"I am a fan of miles farmers market, I like everything great fried chicken but I disliked the sausage!"}
{"text":"This place is the not-so-hidden gem of the East side.  It's got a little bit of everything except items like dog food or wrapping paper.    The produce section is huge.  Excellent for leafy greens or garden produce.  When fruit is in season, their mix-n-match program is awesome because you can load 1 plastic bag up with seven different kinds of plums.  Makes shopping a lot easier.  They have hard to find stuff too like star fruit or dragon fruit, if you are into that kind of thing.  The meat department is one of the better ones in the area.  If they don't have it, you can order it.  I ordered 10 duck legs and 4lbs of duck fat which they got for me in a day during the holidays.  They have daily specials for the meat as well and you can really save some money by buying in larger quantities and freezing.  I would avoid the fish counter.  It never looks fresh (I am there probably 3X per week) and most times is still frozen.  There are better places in the area to buy fish.  The deli counter is awesome.  That's all I need to say about it.  Also, if you want inexpensive spices, check them out here.  You will save a couple bucks for each one and they are larger in size than at the standard grocery stores.  I love the wine selection here.  Their wine guy- Sean- is very knowledgeable.  Tell him what you are cooking and he will find you the right bottle.  One of the better wine selections in the area."}
{"text":"Love Love Love!!! I just wish it was closer, it is typical to but a little more expensive than West Side Market but the produce and food is always fresh and the employee are very helpful!!"}
{"text":"I love this little Market - farm fresh produce, a fully staffed deli and meat market and traditional Amish bakery.  When I am in the mood to shop and browse this is my go to spot.  Really old school with the shelf stable products under the perishable products on lower shelves.  For this reason it takes a while to find specific items.  But that said they are super helpful and will show you right where it is!"}
{"text":"I love miles market. First off the employees are great,nice, and friendly especially at the deli! The food is all fresh and excellent! The bakery department always has delicious treats! Ohhhh and that fried chicken is to die for!!!! I recommend this place to anyone if you want great tasting good quality food!"}
{"text":"I stop by for lunch at least once week since it is down the street from my work. Everything is so fresh and they carry so many different kinds of fruits and vegetables you wouldn't find elsewhere. Definitely recommend to anyone, even just to browse around the market. Its got something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great produce, seafood, & meat. Fried chicken & ribs also.  Not best place for employment by any means!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and wish that I would go more often to do my shopping.  They offer a lot of variety and high quality items that you won't find at any other local grocery store. We love their homemade burgers and baked goods.  I would give 5 stars, but it is SUPER tight in there.  I have also never had a positive experience with the other shoppers.  The people are RUDE.  Not the employees.  They're fantastic.  But the main reason I don't go there more often is the other shoppers."}
{"text":"The salmon I purchased from the meat counter was by far, the best tasting and freshest fish I've had in land locked Ohio that's  fo' sho! ... Honey pleeeze.... The skirt steak? OMG!  it was sooo tender and tasty, I will drive a couple of extra miles to get the best for my family. Plus it makes me look like a rock star! There was an abundance of specialty cheeses and exotic fruits from around the globe. Yeah, not as much as the Market but with less traffic and better informed local folks. It has  hometown charm with a safe friendly environment. The service of loading my car?  ..... LOVED IT! The heat n eat and sushi section was very well displayed and delish!   I, like a few of the folks who just weren't paying attention, did manage to pick up an over ripe dragon fruit... Only to be shown this by the checkout girl... (who, without skippen a beat) replaced it for me. That 'wowed' me..... jus a lil bit.  Although, it's not a cheap mass market ''bag 'em and drag 'em\" kinda place, this is a good destination spot for me.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Great year round farmers market. One of my favorite places to buy fresh produce and beef jerky! Also just tried their pies which are fabulous. Definitely check this place out while on the east side of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Although it makes you feels like you're stepping into the twilight zone & suddenly transported back in time, the Miles Farmers Market has an incredible selection of produce, cheese & meat. They also surprised me by have interesting & exotic fruits and vegetables that I can't find at Whole Foods, Trader Joes or Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago we got a red velvet cake for a birthday party. It was a huge disappointment. When I took a bite I wanted to spit it out because it was completely dry (old?) and the even frosting tasted dry and way too sweet. I couldn't spit it out because I had people around me but definitely I didn't take a second bite. Yuck! And I do like Miles Market usually (that's why it will be rated 2 stars instead of 1) but I will never buy another cake from them again.   Well, we did buy the cake again because the place is close to my house...I know I said never again...the cake was just as bad as last year."}
{"text":"Their catering is phenomenal. My business orders it in about every weekend we work.   Fresh delicious bread, meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruit and salads.   My favorite.   Just had me a turkey, lettuce, tomato, provolone on their sourdough with huge side of fresh strawberries, blueberries as well as other fruit.  I am sittling here trying to control the urge to go get more."}
{"text":"Local owned grocer that has all the workings of a commercial supermarket with a sea,l town feel. I love the prepared foods area, the ribs and fried chicken were awesome.   I love how they carry lots of local foods such as produce, honey, sauces, etc. There was about 10 different kinds of local apples!   The bakery looked amazing as well. Lots of homemade goodies to try!"}
{"text":"This store is crammed with variety (two full shelves of different oils - olive, truffle, sesame, etc etc). Lots of candy, dairy products and other interesting things.  I didn't think the prices were particularly great, the store doesn't look all that clean (maybe it's the lack of bright lighting?), and I've seen moldy fruit and pastries for sale here (no more or less than I've seen at Giant Eagle, but still....)"}
{"text":"Love it! Great produce, great selection of hot sauces, good coffee and awesome service. It's convenient, good parking, and less of a hassle than West Side Market."}
{"text":"Miles Market is my go to place for produce and so much more.  Calling this a farmer's market is a misnomer since it has evolved into so much more.   Lets start with what built Miles Market, the fruits and vegetables which I find to be outstanding quality, very fresh and reasonably priced.   Two factors contribute greatly to this first Miles Market sells an incredible amount of produce and second as a major distributor to other stores so they have their choice.  Looking over the vast selection and variety you will find something you want.  Look for daily and weekly specials that will allow you to get some worthwhile deals.  Miles Market has also added a decent selection of organic produce for those looking for it.  The bakery turns out some of the best baked goods in the area.  The pastries are pretty and flavorful with a nice level of sweetness.  There is a nice variety of excellent pies and cakes available.  Breads and rolls are hearty and well baked.  Prices are a bit expensive, but considering the quality you will get what you are paying for.  The deli has a extensive selection of freshly prepared salads, deli meats and sliced cheeses.   Often the issue is the wait to be served since the almost everyone wants to pick something up.    The fish and seafood is impeccably fresh.  It is not the biggest selection in the area, but what they put out is always high quality and well priced.  I enjoy stopping in and seeing what hits my fancy.  Miles Market also has an excellent meat and poultry selection that should satisfy almost every carnivore's desires.  The prepared foods are also of high quality with great flavor.  With everything from fried foods to sushi to hearty full meals to a seafood bar, you can find a way to satisfy your appetite.  There is a very nice selection of beer and wine, a good variety of high quality cheeses.  There are plenty of processed food and staples scattered about the store.  There is a compact dairy section with some of the best eggs around.  One of the best deals in town is the one pound packages of smoked salmon pieces that they sell for about $10.  The lox is high quality with a nice smokey taste to compliment the luxurious fish.  The pieces may not be as pretty as what you get other places but at about half the price it is hard to go wrong.   The staff at Miles Market are always friendly and helpful, which makes the experience even better.  If you go on the weekend be ready for quite a crowd, but you will probably see someone you know.  If you haven't been to Miles Market you should give it a try.  If you have been there you know what a treat it is to go and see what you can find this trip."}
{"text":"My parents live less than a mile from Miles Market, which is very lucky for me when I'm in town visiting.   I have a soft spot for this shop, since my very first job was in the bakery. The job wasn't the best ever, but the experience let me know that the foods are high quality and that management sincerely aims to provide top quality service and foods. For the products and service the sale items which rotate weekly and quite a few of their regularly priced items are reasonably priced, and otherwise prices are decent.  The meats selection is vast and affordable for the product your receiving. I usually get a pickle from one of the giant pickle barrels. Their salsas, sauces, chips and beverage selection is always intriguing, as is their extensive beer selection."}
{"text":"I loved this place growing up and came here for years. This is an easy 5 star establishment that has been of high quality for years and hopefully years to come.  -Great selection on items, whether its ready to eat food, wine/beer, deli, cheese, produce, or grocery items you can find great stuff here.  -The food they make in house was always very good, not sure if they have the bison burgers still, but those were my favorite.   -The bakery was a family favorite, apple pie and cookies were always in our cart every visit.  -The prices are good, not jacked up high like some co-op, farmers markets etc can be. You can do weekly shopping at a great price.  They are one of best options to shop in the area, I would suggest giving them a try if you want to support a great local sourced business."}
{"text":"Great selection of produce.  Realistic looking apples and plums, local produce.  I think the boxed canned stuff is a little pricier than chain grocery stores.  They have lots of local products like honey for example.  The prepared food is good.  I really loved the quinoa salad and the fried chicken.  I don't think I'll routinely get my groceries here because its about twenty minutes away but I would stop by if I was in the area for produce and lunch."}
{"text":"Miles Market is a fresh produce lovers dream!  They have a great variety of fruits  and veggies, along with a fabulous selection of cheeses! The best part about this store is its prices. Right now, for example, I've been able to find not only the cheapest, but the best quality pomegranates, figs, mangos, and persimmons anywhere!  Be warned that it is relatively small, and does get pretty swamped on the weekends!  All in all, this is a great store to do your grocery shopping!"}
{"text":"Excellent produce selection, along with a well- stocked butcher shop and cured meat department. The prepared entrees also seem to be very popular, but we didn't take anything home to sample. The store is super busy and has a bit of an awkward layout, but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I enjoy shopping at Miles Farmers Market. Fresh Coffee is waiting for you upon your entrance. The only downfall is that it's always packed, especially on the weekends.   The produce is fresh and extensive. You can find a lot of specialty sauces, oils, dressings, jams, etc. here. Miles also has a nice variety of beer, wine and cheese. Did I mention their bakery? The homemade pies in particular are some of the best around. Pretty decent meat and seafood counter too. Check the local circular as they have great sales on their meats. The butcher's and bakers I've talked to there are very knowledgeable and are helpful.  Miles Farmers Market get's a solid 4 stars from this foodie...."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the first time ever. I really love this place! The prices seem really great. They have a great selection of meat. Meats I've never had before. A turkey leg? Yes please! We cooked it last night and wow! So delicious! The muffins they sell were actually really pricey but very good. I want more! The bread were a good value. Tasty too. Can you tell I tried everything we bought. I signed up to be a member and they give points. I think the lady said after $500 you get $10 off the next purchase? They never expire. So I'll be back even though it's a bit of a drive for me."}
{"text":"Full discloser this place for me, (CLE Hts) is a total out of the way gem!!! My brother introduced me and I am very happy he did. They have a great selection of cheese dips,(made in house), and a variety of other dips again made in house, that have been a HUGE hit to every party/get together, I have brought them to. They also make a crazy good potato salad. Their produce is fantastically fresh, and classic old school load your groceries in your car for you. You drive up and boom, loaded no charge/tip. They also make fresh food (sandwiches, burgers, etc.) I have not tried yet, but it smells wonderful. If you don't live close I highly recommend you still check them out."}
{"text":"I visited Miles Market for the first and what will be the last time in July 2011.  While shopping, I came across a package of naan (flatbread) that had 2 large (over an inch) white furry spots inside the unopened package.  From a different area, I bought refrigerated fresh tortellini.  I opened it the minute I got home to find a green hairball of mold (again over an inch across) growing in the middle of the pasta package.  This had not been visible in any direction from the outside.  The sell-by date was still a week away, so this wasn't old.  It was clear to me that the products were just not handled appropriately.  I would not return to this market."}
{"text":"This review is for the fried chicken. All I can say is:  BELIEVE THE HYPE.   The fried chicken rocks my world on every front. The best in Cleveland. I am a fried chicken expert."}
{"text":"Fantastic butcher department. All the meat is is fresh and they work with you to make a cut for your needs. I buy my chicken and sirloin steaks here because the product is fresh and reasonably priced. They offer in house made sausages which are wonderful. Nothing like legitimate butcher service.  Nice selection of fruits and vegetables. A really nice spread of produce. Looking for escarole? They have it. The quality and freshness is top notch. Tons of selection.   The prepared foods area is wonderful. General Frank's fried chicken is excellent. Way better than any fast food fried chicken. During clambake season, they offer DIY clambakes or cooked \"ready to go\". You just need to give them some advanced notice so they can prepare them. They have other food packaged and ready to heat and serve. Things like meatloaf, chicken and fish.   My only con. Come here on a busy time of day and navigating around can be a little hectic. The isles are narrow and getting the cart around all the foot traffic can be tough sometimes. Still a great place to shop. Most of the time I'm in here picking up a few items so usually I can get in and out through the express check out lines."}
{"text":"The produce selection is excellent.  A lot of selections. Features local produce in seasonal selection.  Wine selection is great. The wine guy is really helpful to find your favorite selection as well as for beers.   My favorite are the cheese selection, meat counter and the mini food bar. The bakery always smell so good......  The meat is always fresh and usually have some crowd there during after work rush.  I think the food bar have the best fried chicken in Cleveland area. Nice and crunchy breading, not too salty and not too spicy. The potato log are huge. Best fried chicken anywhere.  I moved away too far now from the market. Every now and then, I travel 45 minutes to the store to get my favorite supplies."}
{"text":"won't go back, less than 5 days after my visit the spaghetti squash is completely rotted inside and the peppers are covered with mold,  Looked good when I bought them but obviously are not locally grown or fresh since the ones I bought 3 days before in the local supermarket are still fresh.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I read about this place and thought it might be fun to visit.  It's really like a giant grocery store!  Really busy, lots of people.  Lots of really rude people.  Folks who work in the bakery were arguing with a customer about an order...the guy kept saying \"what do YOU want ME to do about it?\" And the lady who finally came to wait on me said \"what do you want\", I said \"nothing thank you\" and walked away.  The times in their bakery case looked old and very messy.  Chocolate on top of a miniature Boston cream pie was discolored.  It didn't get much better when I went to check out.  Cashiers were rude and looked at me like I was an alien (I'm not, just visiting!!!)  Needless to say, cool grocery store...never going back!"}
{"text":"My favorite local grocery store. The produce is not only the freshest but often has great deals. The bakery department is too notch, the pies are a must try. I love the Italian bread and they have the best ham salad.  They also have a great prepared food department with dinners you just have to pop in the oven."}
{"text":"Saturday 2pm  The whole reason for deciding to go to Miles Market was the search for a particular apple I'd found at the West Side Market - but the vendor there said that type of apple had gotten too expensive to be profitable for him. He suggested Miles. So I called in advance about that apple type and was told they'd have some on the weekend.   If they indeed had them, I must have as Maxwell Smart might have said, \"Missed it by that much!\" because the produce dept. guy said they were all out of that type for the season. However, he showed me several other varieties that compared, and even cut out a nice juicy slice to try.   The bread and pastry case is temptation - and I rightfully gave in! There were Amish treats, cakes, bagels, and more. There's a hot-to-go section with fried chicken, soups, and sandwiches.  Overall, the store had great selection and friendly service. I liked the feature they had where you can leave a cart full of items in the outer part of the store, take a number then drive up to load your groceries. To me it's just as easy to take them to the car, but if I was buying for a big family, that would be a good feature. They also have a little dine-in area where I sat and enjoyed that Amish cinnamon roll - or maybe I was devouring any evidence of cheating on the diet!  The only criticism I had is that the store is a little challenging to navigate. There are in-aisle products and I'd imagine as I went on a weekend, when it's busy and there are lookie-loos like me, then getting in and around can be a bit more challenging. This however is nothing new to me. I live within walking distance to the West Side Market, so I'm used to the touristy kind of shopping atmosphere.   (*looking down* Oh please YELP.... do we have to have a survey question that asks about Pokémon stops?! Is that what it's come to?)"}
{"text":"Miles market is the perfect spot to pick up the freshest fruits, veggies, juices, lunchmeat, and cheeses. This little market is filled with interesting and unique finds. It's quaint and cozy and is true to the name Miles has that charming farmers market feel.   This is an excellent location to pick up produce, deli items, fresh bread, and those unusual items you don't find at just any grocery store but I would recommend (and here's where the four stars instead of five comes into play) shopping elsewhere for your other grocery needs such as prepackaged foods, canned goods, and dairy. Their prices are pretty high and you're almost always guaranteed to find those types of items cheaper elsewhere.   This still is a great place to shop but I sometimes wish it could be a one stop shop instead of breaking up grocery lists between stores. I suppose if you don't mind the upcharges then it's not a big deal but there is fewer selection choices, naturally, than a chain store.   If you're looking for a quick bite to eat this place has an amazing prepared foods section with everything from Mexican to oriental to American to Italian style foods and there's seafood, landfood, and vegetarian options so there's definitely something for everyone! (One of my personal favorites are the coconut shrimp!)   This place is lovely and a bit pricey but worth the extra pennies!"}
{"text":"I think I am in love with the girl at the meat counter. I don't think it would ever work though. She does not eat meat. I tried to make small talk about meat. That usually doesn't work with women too much and this time was no different. There is a huge selection of meat with odd ball types of meat that they can slice up for you. The produce section is pretty nice. They have a lot of nuts also. The ready made subs are great for lunch. The idea of providing free coffee for shoppers is fantastic. My employer has had a few catered events from Miles Market and the food is good."}
{"text":"On a little road trip and stopped into a local grocery store, a lady here was nice enough to point us to Miles Farmers market. Glad we went, we picked up some chesses for the room and also needed lunch. We both went with the fried chicken dinner!  Wow, Amazing and the price could not be beat! We will be back when we are in the area next time just for the chicken dinner.  Crispy, hot, full of flavor, just too bad you can't pick different sides even if there was an upcharge."}
{"text":"They have lots kinds of fresh punch/fruit juice. The meats are well cut, however, not too many options. The wine collections are wonderful and you can find some special desert wine on their shelf. Most of the veges are OK but some of them have been sitting there for a while and dehydrated."}
{"text":"No matter how hard they seem to try on getting friendly help my last visit had an operator who was a snot. In the past, they had employee problems but lately they've improved a great deal. Not today though."}
{"text":"My new favorite grocery store, too bad it's not very close to home for me, but regardless I can definitely see myself making monthly stops here. The grocery store itself is incredibly spacious, much larger that I expected from seeing it from the street. Inside, they have an absolutely fantastic collection of produce, and offer many items that many other specialty grocery stores don't even have, such as root vegetables and Asian fruits. They also have great selection of fish, and a bakery with pretty much everything you could ever want to choose from. The only section I might say was lacking would be the dry goods/ snacks, but they do have enough to pick from, and these items are easy to find elsewhere, so I'm satisfied with the meat and produce selection alone to stop here.  The grocery store itself is also really well maintained- high end without being uppity. They offer fresh coffee at the entrance, and it's very clean and organized inside. Obviously this place is a little pricier than a lower end grocery store, but I was happy to find that a lot of their produce was really fairly priced.  Can't wait to revisit this place, and would definitely recommend to others on the East side!"}
