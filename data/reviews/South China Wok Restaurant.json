{"text":"I ordered a tofu dish for take out. I get home, open the container and there's NO tofu! Not one piece. The vegetables were flavorless and there were little black spots on the bok choy. Gross. That's the last time I'll waste my $ there."}
{"text":"I recently moved to broadview heights and was looking for a good Chinese resturaunt. I just so happened to find this place. I wish I would have read the reviews first on Yelp. I went in to order takeout and the lady was really rude. She was very short like I was bothering her. I ordered wonton soup and chicken fried rice. Both were bland and had no taste. The soup consisted of broth and several noodles, not like what I am used to. It is safe to say I will not be going back. I will take a drive and go to house of pearl in Brunswick"}
{"text":"This place is our go-to for quick and easy take-out. The Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet and Sour Chicken are the kids' favorite. Their Ginger Cilantro fried rice is unusual, but really good. They're consistently fast and we haven't had a bad meal . Not sure why the negative reviews."}
{"text":"Why is this place still open? Gave it another try yesterday( hoping it had gotten better) 6 on a Sat. night and the place is empty. I'm the only customer! Should have been a sign..
 Waitress was nice. Ordered the Singapore noodles. Pointed out to the waitress that there were only 3 tiny shrimp and maybe 4 tiny pieces chicken in the whole dish. For 9.95  a total ripoff! I want this neighborhood place to be good but after so many horrible meals, never again!"}
{"text":"-Missing The Mark-

A few weeks back, I had moved to Broadview Heights and was hungry for Chinese food, so my girlfriend and I ordered from here in order to sooth our cravings. We decided to get take-out from South China Wok. I ordered over the phone and the experience was nice. I then went to go pick it up at the given time and the order was fresh, hot, and ready on arrival. After heading home, my girlfriend and I opened our food.

She got the Orange Chicken and I got the General Tso's Chicken. It was semi-hard to tell them apart, no labeling and it was actually pretty hard to decipher what each one was based on taste. That's a big problem when General Tso's Chicken should be quite spicy and Orange Chicken is very sweet.

Aside from the chicken being slightly under seasoned on both dishes, this place is great. Service is nice, serving sizes are plentiful, there's plenty of sauce to cover each piece of chicken, chicken was perfectly cooked, and the pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Elegant decor, great date night spot due to fact its tucked away in a strip mall near a coffee-pastry shop open late.  The food is traditional style and we never had a bad meal here.  They could advertise more, but lot of people get their take out.  Overall good food, and good service.  We enjoy."}
{"text":"Wanted some cheap run-of-the-mill Chinese takeout so figured this would satisfy. Ordered beef and broccoli combination with the pork fried rice. Beef and broccoli had a slightly sour flavor and was mostly bland and watery. The \"pork\" fried rice contained zero pork. The people working there were nice but unfortunately the food was not."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I ordered today for lunch and the food was very bland and was not enjoyed by everyone. 

For example; 
the egg rolls included in the combo platter only had cabbage in them and were not crispy. same for the Spring rolls which were barely filled with even cabbage 
the chicken and broccoli was very bland and not seasoned 
the portion sizes were less than what we are used to from other Chinese food places 

On a positive side note, the service was polite and friendly. 

(We have been told by coworkers that Frankie's Wok in Brecksville is a good area choice, so we will be trying them next!)"}
{"text":"Food here was only OK ...but to be fair, i only had takeout here once.  The chicken with vegetables was pretty good.  The pork fried rice \"upgrade\" was disappointing and not worth the extra $2.50 over free steamed rice.  The wonton soup was unlike any wonton soup I've ever had...just wide rice noodles in broth.  I could not even eat it."}
{"text":"Very good for a Chinese restaurant.  Many Chinese places tend to be greasy.  The food here was fresh and tasty, without being heavy.   I think that's why some of the reviews aren't as good.  If you would prefer \"typical\" Chinese food, this is a little different.  In a good way!   Our group had: vegetable spring rolls, mushroom egg foo yung, Buddha delight,  Szechuan broccoli, and egg drop soup.  Everyone enjoyed their food."}
