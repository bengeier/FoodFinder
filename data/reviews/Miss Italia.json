{"text":"The pizza is quite good, very tasty. Been twice recently, and will defiantly be back, and try something else.  Nice big place, two floors with a terrace. Good service, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A large pizza with Sausage (more like pepperoni), mushroom and green peppers for 30$????  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"I went here twice. Once about 5 months ago and the other time a week ago. Both times were dine ins.  The wait staff is cordial and the decor is decent for a pizzeria. They have a very nice terrace with a fountain and a decent sized parking lot. Both times, we came pretty late in the evening and there wasn't much of a crowd. Only 1-2 other tables.   We ordered a medium pepperoni/bacon pizza (that's what my date enjoys) and it was delicious. I do admit that when I got to my last slice, the crust started to sag and the oil was to be desired but it was still very yummy. Once it arrives, it's crust is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. They actually use bacon slices and not bacon bits which I applaud them for. That must be part of the reason why it is so oily after a while.. And so yummy.  I'd go back here if I was in the area. Hopefully earlier in the day so I can enjoy their terrace."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat for a family lunch, or dinner.  The good: Food is good. It is a nice pizza/pasta place (and they have other stuff, but I never tried it). Place is usually busy but you have places to sit, normally. Bathrooms are clean.  The bad: Waitresses can be a little too friendly and too personal sometimes. Discussing plans of the restaurant with employees in the restaurant area, in front of costumers, not a good thing. Bathrooms are one room with door. So if it is busy, you will have to wait outside. Old people will look at you while they come in, or sitting down, like you are invading \"their\" space.  I cannot give it four stars. I just cannot. But it is a very strong three as the food is good there."}
