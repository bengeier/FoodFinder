{"text":"I have only eaten lunch here but each time food was good, but the service was on the slow side. The \"big boy\" is good and fries were perfectly cooked every time. The hand cooked meatballs were lacking in taste and texture, and didn't stay together well at all."}
{"text":"Dinner showed up 1:10 minuets after ordering. Band although pretty good blasts us out the restaurant. The bill showed a .50 rocks charge. Ha. Whats this, a rocks tax?? Server says all the restaurants are doing it.         

First one I've seen. We have been to San Fran. Washington D.C. and San Diego, in the last few weeks and this is the first we have seen. A rocks charge with no explanation, I don't think so.

Ah, the food. Fish fry was reasonably good eggplant parm, so so good bread.

Won't go back. This was the third time."}
{"text":"We had lunch here last Staurday (Aug. 16th)  We were suprised by the quality of the food and service.  My wife had the Big Fat Greek berger, I has a Gyro.  Both were wonderful.  We were in town for a Wedding Renewal, and found this place with the help of Yelp.  By the way, Becky came out of the kitchen and asked us how we liked our meals.  Great touch.  If we did not live more than three hours away, we would come back often.  We will return next time we are in town. Next time we will come later and stay for the entertainment."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I came here tonight and had amazing dinners! My husband ordered the chicken Marsala and I ordered the salmon special. The food quality and menu options rival dinners I've us in NY, LA- not sure who the chef is, but definitely worth every penny spent!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Food and the service are good. Never been for the music at night but it looks like they bring in some good bands.  Also (I know this is a weird thing to note) but they have a nice bathroom and I think that reflects positively on the restaurant   

My client usually gets the gyro for lunch and he loves it.  I usually go for the veggie wrap. Always good!"}
{"text":"This place must be going under. We came in for an \"express lunch\" (as advertised in the window) and it was a stale environment. A few people scattered around. Sticky floors, sticky (gross) menus and used ash trays on the \"patio\" (gross).  Prices seemed ridiculously high for lunch. It took so long for the waitress to get our water that we had enough time to contemplate all these things, discuss them, then decide to leave before she came back. Not so express. Skip this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! Warm friendly staff and the owner Becky is always around to make you feel welcome. Excellent food and live music too! Highly recommend ! Enjoy!  Burgers are huge, best Italian wedding soup in town!"}
{"text":"Food was only fair. Our party ordered three veal Marsala.  Serving were inconsistent. One had no sauce, another too much. All veal was tough. Took 45 minutes to get food after placing the order. Second time here and probably the last."}
{"text":"Wow was I blown away tonight! 
The bread was delicious. Ordered the Italian wedding soup and a wedge salad. My bf wasn't thrilled with the soup because it didn't have any of little pasta balls in it like he's used to seeing in the soup. 
He had the chicken Marsala which was amazing and I had the salmon which is photographed on here! Delicious!!!! 
Great food, great service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a lot riding on this restaurant. Myself and 8 coworkers were working out of town in an unfamiliar area. I'm the only yelper in the group. I insisted we pass on fast food and try something local.  A quick yelp search brought us here. I was nervous because if I had made the wrong choice I would never hear the end of it! They're a brutal group. The yelp reviews ranged from two to four stars, so it could go either way. Once we arrived here we were all impressed with the patio but chose to eat inside because it was extremely hot. Considering the size of our group, service was fast with minimal mishaps - a switched bill and a mix up on drinks. Outside of the minor confusion, the food more than made up for it. Large portions, really big gyros and killer veggie sandwiches. Actually, the best veggie sandwich I've ever had! I'd never imagined  sautéed spinach would make a great sandwich.  Prices were reasonable, most lunch specials were $10 and under. Overall a good lunch spot, nice for large groups, decent prices and good atmosphere. Everyone was satisfied, well, except the Debbie downer of the group who is never happy about anything, ever. We agreed, next year this will be our go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Last night I had an expertly prepared and crafted meal at Becky's Bistro. There were three lamb chops with two bones each atop perfectly roasted red potatoes and topped with sautéed spinach with a little tzadziki sauce. The flavors were excellent. It slipped out that I was celebrating my birthday and the lovely server, Ashley, decorated my cannolis. I only ate one and she packed the other one on ice to go. The band City Lite was excellent too.  And Bill Hach from Rebels Without Applause sat in and had the whole place dancing, led by the owner of herself Becky."}
{"text":"Overall had a great dining experience. Gyro burger was good. Pizza was great. Music was fantastic. Will definetly return to Becky's."}
{"text":"Food was good but pricey for what it was. I was charged for refills on my beverage, I wasn't told about the charge until I got the bill and discovered my 4 refills were $2.50 each. When you add an additional 12.50 to the bill it becomes ridiculous really quick. 
Won't be going back."}
{"text":"this is a nice classy restaurant. top notch entertainment, nice large bar, Mediterranean inspired menu, and wonderful employees. always packed on the weekends. not sure if they still have the sunday brunch, but is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. We had a party of 8 and everyones food was great and correct! There was a band there and everyone seemed to enjoy them. It was hard to talk at the table but we will be happy to go back, to enjoy dinner or the band separately next time. The waitress was very friendly and attentive even with the place packed. 
-- this yelp review was courtesy of my parents' visit there."}
{"text":"Becky's Bistro is a hidden gem. I had the gyro platter and a side salad and it was incredible. Fresh food, nice atmosphere and great service! I would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"What a great place! I have been here a few times, the food & atmosphere is a swanky bistro- however the people are salt of the earth. Decent wine list, they could expand on their beer selection, authentic cuisine!! Oh- Did I mention the live music? This place becomes a toe tapping hip joint with 1960's music!"}
{"text":"First time experience tonight. 
Went to hear a band. Had dinner .
The service was friendly & efficient.
However, the food was just so so.
Prices too high, for quality of food."}
{"text":"Ok....I am hoping that Becky's Bistro has finally made the changes it needs to become a staple in Willoughby Hills and in the east burbs of Cleveland.  Becky's (the owner) little restaurant has been having an identity crisis the last couple years trying to figure out menu issues, who to cater to, live music options, and food quality / chefs (cooks) but I think after my most recent visit (4/14) I think its finally hitting its stride.  

Starting last weekend and as advertized in the Friday Magazine in Plain Dealer, Becky's is starting her Sunday Brunch for a reasonable $16 bucks that includes one hell of a spread.  We personally got the run down and say pictures from her first brunch weekend when we visited Becky's yesterday.  I have to say I was impressed.  

Another high note is that Becky's has expanded into the next available slip in her mini mall location.  This means that the bar has been extended and seating is now away from the music so you're not completely overwhelmed by 50's/60's/70's tunes blasting in your ears, clouding any conversation you are trying to have.  Sometimes its fun, other times its just a bit pesky if you know what I mean.  The new seating was pleasant enough that we brought our 1 month old daughter in and she slept through it all!!  

Let me end this update on the food.  As my last updated stated, we were not very impressed with the overall effort the restaurant put in and only hoped that the next visit would be better.....oh...and it was.  We were delightfully impressed by the Romaine Salad with grilled salmon and Caesar dressing, the Stuffed Peppers, and the Italian Wedding soup.  Although the soup was a little salty, it definitely tasted like the Italian Wedding soup that I fell in love with over 3 years ago....bravo.  (Its not on menu so make sure to specifically ask for it....I know, weird but that's Becky!)  Now I've tried the stuffed peppers a couple years ago and I have to tell you that the $8 half order not only was that a lot of food but it was wonderfully plated and delicious, its not stuffed bells, more like banana peppers.  Salmon on the salad was cooked perfectly.  It reminded me of a really good grilled romaine wedge that I had while years ago, although Becky's romaine isn't grilled, its still crisp and tasty.  

Glass of red was only $4.75 and beer was $3.50, cheaper then places that offer Happy Hour wines for $5 a glass.  Our tab before tip after 3 beers and wine was less then $50.  We had a great late night snack and just love the changes (except the removal of the meatball sub).  We can't wait to try out the brunch.  Expect a quick note about the brunch in the coming weeks."}
{"text":"My guest and I just had a great meal at Becky's Bistro. My guest had the teriyaki pork chop.I tasted it and it was great,cooked perfectly. I had their famous beet salad. Never take it off the menu. I also had the muscles in wine sauce with tomatoes and garlic,fabulous. I was always a little hesitant to try this restaurant. I will come back again. Our waitress Ashley was great.I give it five stars."}
{"text":"Went for some after work cocktails grabbed a sausage mushroom pizza. Very delicious and fresh.  I highly recommend it to all !!!"}
{"text":"It was a very nice night out.  First things or areas of improvement.  The wife and I showed up for our reservations at 6 pm I ordered the in bone ribeye and the wife ordered the special of the night which was glazed pork chop.  The waitress came back to inform me that they was out of the steak. (at 6pm??). So I said ok I will have the special as well.  The waitress came back and said they only had the one chop??? (Again 6pm??). So I ordered Salmon I know so close to what I wanted. :)
Now to finish on the positive and the reason for 3 out of 5.
The food was very good see pictures.  The wait staff was great and the dinner music and atmosphere pulled this from a 0 to a hero.  If they would have had the did that was advertised (on menu and what the specials were) this could have been a 5."}
{"text":"The group I went with had a reservation for 17 for several weeks. My table of six was seated by 6:30. The waitress, Samantha, showed up about 7 to take our orders. At 8:00, everyone but me had been served and was part way done eating. When I inquired where my dinner was, since my entire table had been served, I got a lecture about how it wasn't her fault and the kitchen was backed up. There were 4 other people in our group who also hadn't been served yet, despite others at their tables being almost done eating. At 8:15, I left the restaurant, still hungry, and went home and made myself a sandwich. Never again."}
