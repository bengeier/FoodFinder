{"text":"I'm so pleased to say that Dante's Inferno Paninoteca is my new favorite place to eat. I've been living at Ossington and Davenport for over a year now, and my one complaint has always been that there is never anywhere nearby to eat. Dante's Inferno is a breath of fresh air in neighborhood that is lacking in great food and great customer service.

I've been to Dante's Inferno 4 times now, I've had 4 of there sandwiches and a pizza, and they were all AMAZING!!! My favorite sandwich being the Fordius Maximus (Pork Cutlet) but you have to get it with the house made hot pepper spread. It is to DIE FOR!! 

To all you hungry souls living in Davenport Village, you MUST eat here. Everything is made in house, which I really appreciate. There pizza dough and tomato sauce was made from scratch and when I ordered take away, the pizza wasn't soggy when I got home. Kudos to Sergio who is the pizza maker and Co-owner of Dante's with his sister Maria, who is also a gem and she gave me a free espresso last time I came in.

Anyways, I wanted to write this review because I'm so happy that I finally have a great place to eat in Davenport Village.

P.S. I recommend ordering the Estasi pizza, it was sooooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"This pizza was a game changer. The crust/dough was done to perfection and their ingredients were clearly fresh. The owner was there and I could tell he was passionate about his food and business. 

Big highlight was the cleanliness of the store. I was able to see back into the kitchen and behind the counter and everything looked VERY clean! 

Definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"A welcome new neighbourhood joint I plan on going back to over and over again. The pizza was great, and I'd argue the sandwiches were better.

The pizza crust was light and chewy, and solid enough to stand up to the toppings. The sauce was bright and flavourful, just enough cheese, and delicious pepperoni.  Best pizza I've had in a long time.

The sandwiches were on fresh crusty panini, with plenty of saucy toppings - the arugula and mushrooms in the pork belly were the perfect earthy, tangy balance to the sweet fatty pork.

Highly recommended! You want to go to here! Perfect place for dinner takeout on the way home!"}
{"text":"Dante's is my go-to pizza shop in Toronto. The staff are polite and cheery, the decor is clean and crisp, but the pizza...THE PIZZA!               Mama.

The crust is not thin, but no too thick, with a delightfully crunchy bottom that gives way to a satisfying chew mid-crust. Excellent variety of high quality toppings, including an incredibly flavourful made-in-house (I believe) Italian sausage.  

Only drawback is that delivery in the evenings can often take an hour, but the wait is worth it. Just schedule accordingly and order in advance of your ravenous hunger pangs."}
{"text":"An upscale Italian sandwich and pizza spot. 

I sampled the sausage sandwich and the pork belly. Both tasted homemade...by someone who knows what they're doing. Fresh ingredients, lovely mushrooms and arugula - and some of the best sandwich bread you'll have in the city. 

If you want a sloppy, disgusting deep fried \"veal\" sandwich, this is not the spot for you. But if you like to treat your body as a temple (as I do!) and enjoy Italian sandwiches, go check out Dante's Inferno. It's also clean, which is unusual for this type of establishment."}
{"text":"We love this crisp pizza crust, not too thin, but welcoming. You can taste each individual ingredient - pure, simple and authentic.  Highly recommended. Consistent. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's literally the definition of hole in the wall, but the pizza was very good and should not be missed.

Unfortunately the staff was not overly welcoming at first to us--though that  standoffishness was only reserved for Stranger Danger, as a regular was addressed warmly by name right after we came in. The server did warm up to us while we sat at the small counter and demolished our pepperoni slices so maybe we should have introduced ourselves by name with a handshake or a hug to perk up the server's RBF?

Speaking of said pepperoni slices, they were excellent! From topping to crust, the entire meal was flavorful and no crumbs went uneaten.

Automatic loss of one star when you don't accept cards (really, in 2017?) and that always seems shady to me in this day and age."}
{"text":"Dante's Inferno is without question (in my humble opinion), the greatest pizza in the city. Nestled at the corner of Ossington and Davenport, this blink-and-you'll-miss shop makes the absolute best pies I (or my family) have had in Toronto.

The atmosphere inside is welcoming, and the decor very cool.

I highly recommend both the 'fun guys in paradise', as well as the Ciacco. The crust can easily be described as a fusion of thin and thick crust, and has been a highlight each time we have ordered.

The only detractor I would say, is be aware that wait-times can be sporadic due to demand. This is nothing against the restaurant itself, just something to keep in mind if you are quoted 20-30 minutes over the phone, and the pizza comes out after 50 minutes. This is simply a demand constraint, and just stands as a testament to the care taken over each pizza's creation.

If you live in the northwest quadrant of the city, mark this place as a must-try. Order them big, and guarantee yourself leftovers."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza here on a good day. However, they suffer from pretty serious inconsistency, which can be really disappointing. Sometimes the cheese isn't melted. Sometimes there is almost no sauce on the pizza. Sometimes the mushrooms are raw. Sometimes the sauce is seriously under-seasoned. It's a bummer, because when it's good, it's really good."}
{"text":"hands down the best sausage ive ever had. it could have sat on the fresh toasty bread all by itself and it would still be a winner!

i got the barbariccia's salsiccia and my fiancee got the belly of the beast. both were amazing.

we also got the olives and slice of pepperoni pizza. 

you won't regret coming here. great food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"first pizza i requested well done, but got burnt and black. the nice owner gladly replaced it free, but i've had several disappointing meals there. how it get's such a stellar rating is beyond me.

great people, great idea, average food at best."}
{"text":"At my new office there's a few of us foodies. We order in food. Our manager tells us about Dante's last month. Our office is too far for delivery. I had a meeting nearby and suggested I pick up lunch for our little group. He's like: really?! Me: I travel for food! 

He got the Barbacinni sandwich extra spicy. I got the Fordius Maximus and my colleague got the Beatrice. Everything is made in-house. Fresh and delicious! The bread is perfect, you can bite into your sandwich without tiring your jaw out! Absolutely delicious! Our manager got the spicy olives. He devoured them.

We also got the Indulgenza pizza... OMG! It was sooooo good! We stuffed ourselves and shared a couple of slices with others. Now everyone is asking: where did you go for that pizza?! 

We all said we hope one of us has a meeting up in that area again because it is so worth going back to."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh ingredients. Pizza crust is perfection. Thin, crisp and flavourful, not cardboard. Can't wait to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and this will clearly be my go-to for years to come. Pizza is crisp without being \"thin-crust\" and the cheese and toppings are fresh and delightful. Can't wait to try all the sandwiches in the menu!"}
{"text":"I've had better pizza, but I've also had worse. I prefer thin crust pizzas, so if you're like me you may want to try somewhere else. I found the bottom of the crust to have an excessive amount of flour. I ordered extra basil, and they were very generous! Friendly staff, especially Sergio. I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"We frequently order from Dante's when we aren't feeling up to making dinner on a weeknight.

Service has been friendly and our order arrives hot and fresh.

I do wish they offered salads (supposedly they may in the future) as sometimes I need some veggies alongside my pizza, but it's not the end of the world.

Our go to order is the diavola pizza with a side of olives. The pizza can be a bit on the salty side (due to the dried olives and cured meat) but it tastes oh so good.

Until next time Dante's!"}
{"text":"A new addition to the neighbourhood that's already a mainstay.

We've been here a few times, and keep coming back. The pork belly panini (\"Belly of the Beast\" hits the right balance of rich and flavourful. Among my family we've also enjoyed the pork cutlet (\"Fordius Maximus\") and meatball panini (\"Mascheroni's Polpettoni\") - my kid was astounded by the size of the meatballs! Can't stop talking about it. He is also a fan of the pepperoni pizza slice (which is prized similarly to other slice places - $3-something) and we've also enjoyed an off-menu item, pizza with cheese and bacon, which is actually their marinated pork belly from the \"beast\" panini, and is so good. Last night I tried the \"Estasi\" pizza with prosciutto, arugula, and fig, and it was really lovely.

Not much room to eat in, just seats at the counter, but it is a nice atmosphere with cozy lighting, old black-and-white movies on the tv, and posters featuring Marcello Mastroianni. The people are friendly and welcoming, and there's already a fairly steady stream of regular customers. The \"clever\" menu names and \"ten commandments\" are a bit silly, but worth ignoring for delicious food."}
{"text":"We had the pizza here one night, pizza done well , tasty and crispy. Sandwiches look cool too, will have to try them next time.  We were hoping they served rice balls but no luck :("}
{"text":"I came to this place to grab a quick bite to eat. The woman behind the counter was friendly to us and chatted with us as we waited for our food. I ordered a belly of the best sandwich. It was pork belly with arugula and mushrooms. It was super delicious. I ate every last crumb. My friend got a slice of 'za. They usually have some slices ready to go, pepperoni, veggie the usual. They also sells buns and espresso beans and other little what nots. Be warned, the owner really prefers when you pay cash. She even has a cash only sign displayed on the counter. As soon as I mentioned it, she said she did have a machine and would accept debit but she explained that she didn't regularly offer it to customers. She got a bit upset at another customer when he only bought a bun on debit and it was a bit uncomfortable to be around the conversation. Totally understand why she was upset, but it definitely hindered my enjoyment of the atmosphere there. Anyways, they do take away pizzas and I will definitely be trying one soon. I got the impression this was a great neighbourhood place where the owner knows a lot of the locals and they do a lot of business with repeat customers. Just bring cash!!!"}
{"text":"There was five of us and we all got something different so a few pizzas will be covered today.
Let me start by saying that I didn't try everyone's pizza but I got each persons thoughts on how their pie was. 
I went with the Eretica Pizza.
It's prosciutto, mozzarella and arugula. When I see this type of pizza on the menu it's always my go to for testing the waters. The crust was cooked to perfection. It was not super thin but far from thick. Just enough to give you some a firm slice while holding but also having a nice crunch while eating. No saggy slice here. The edge had a nice chew to it as well. The sauce was just right, in the amount and the acidity. The mozzarella had nice flavour and wasn't excessive. The fresh arugula and the prosciutto on top hit the spot. It all went together very well. If I had to change anything on this pizza it would be maybe to add a drizzle of spicy oil on top. I would definitely go for this pizza again.
The second pizza was the Inferno.
The toppings were spicy soppressata, spicy Calabrese sausage, hot peppers, bell peppers, tomato sauce and mozzarella. The comments I got for this pizza was it was great and it was HOT!
The third pizza was the Margherita.
The co-worker who grabbed this pizza couldn't have the cheese and Dante's had no issue accommodating their request. The typical Margherita comes with mozzarella and basil. This one had no cheese but they opted to add hot pepper flakes. Their comments were it was a tad dry but they finished the whole pie.
The fourth pizza was the Maddalena.
This pizza contained tomatoes, capers, anchovies, oven dried black olives, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, basil and mozzarella. The comments were it was ok but all the flavours were very over powering. Also they said it was a touch salty. They probably wouldn't pick this one again.
The last pizza was the Indulgenza.
This pie was topped with soppressata, prosciutto cotto, mushrooms, red peppers, basil and mozzarella. The comments for this one was overall good. They loved their pizza."}
{"text":"I have a very short list of places where I can get a truly exceptional pizza from. Dante's easily made the list. It is pizza perfection in my book."}
{"text":"Delicious single slice of veggie pizza. Crust is thin but not too thin. Fresh ingredients. My favourite part was the choice to have homemade hot sauce on the slide. 

Nice bar seating. You can watch outside and people watch. 

No tables. 

Warm in the summer due to the ovens. 

Delicious local spot I stumbled on.  Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Amazing one of the best pork belly sandwiches I've ever had great atmosphere   really nice place   will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've had. When you take a bite of the pizza and it's like you're in Italy. The smells in the shop are amazing when you walk in and it gets you more excited for the pizza that they serve. The staff is so nice and welcoming. And there's such a homey feeling to this delicious pizzeria. Definitely a spot I would love to come back too!"}
