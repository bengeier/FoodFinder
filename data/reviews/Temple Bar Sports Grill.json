{"text":"New to the area and I really like this place.  Staff is great and the food and drink menu is pretty good as well.  I have been in a handful of times and find the regulars to be quite friendly and sociable.  Overall experience has been great."}
{"text":"ho hum bar with nothing spectacular to give it an edge.  Beer selection is week at best.  Food is so so.  Only reason to go here is the neighborhood,  dont go out of your way."}
{"text":"i moved here pretty recently and my mom came to visit. we had a few things to get at target and what not and on the way home we spotted this joint. we decided to pull over and have a beer. unfortunately, we sat outside on the pation on a semi-busy night and never got served. we were sitting there waiting for someone to come up to us to ask us what we would like to drink but alas, 20 minutes later, we decided to leave and have a beer at home."}
{"text":"Hit this spot on the way home and had a quick cocktail and appetizer.  We were greeted and served cocktails promptly.  My cocktail was well made and my guest's beer was very cold.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla from the happy hour menu and it was delicious - spinach tortilla, thick tender chicken, fresh salsa, and generous guacamole portions on the side.  I highly recommend ordering this starter.    The ambiance was dark and inviting, and especially comfortable on a long, hot day like today.  Looking forward to returning, and very much recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Temple Bar - known for sports - also has tremendously good food. Extremely under rated compared to some of their counter parts. Wings are perfection, hamburger to die for with fresh homemade fries and a plethora of healthy options outside of the normal gastronomic bar food selections. A wacky local crowd of regulars and friendly help - some with curvaceous features - Erin. Don't let the laid back ambience fool you into not picking the Temple for the food.  Its genuine and surprisingly good!!!   Mike aka RylWlff."}
{"text":"Could be, quite possibly, the worst wings I've had. Wait...  Four Peaks...  They are really inconsistent, but never good.  They are either way overdone, to a point where the bone disintegrates.. or the skin is soggy and rubbery. If they are deep fried how does that happen?  I guess it's just bar food but put some love into it please!!  I live around the corner and its so convenient.  Great place to watch a game, but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was in town to visit friends on a weekend when penn state was playing. found this place thru the alumni assc. all I can say is they take care of the alums. great service, great food."}
{"text":"Best place in Scottsdale to watch a game and they have bags on the patio.  I love the Spicy Hangover, whether you are hung over or not it does the trick, and the best thing about it is you can get it with Tater Tots!!!!!! Great food, Great Service, and of course cold beer.  The only thing the place needs is more Bronco memorabilia on the walls."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar. Delicious food and relaxed atmosphere. The tuna is my favorite as well as the chips and homemade salsa."}
{"text":"Food is average to below average. I've tried to enjoy it. Have been there many times. Just can't recommend it to friends, unless the only reason is to drink. Then it's OK."}
{"text":"What an extensive menu!  And it is all sounds so good that we were hard-pressed to make a choice.  Go to the restaurant's website and read the menu ahead of your visit.  Included among the entrees were several Irish dishes.   I chose the Hackett's Shepherds Pie which was advertised as being over Irish stew with vegetables, cheese and puffed pastry on top.  My wife hesitated between that and the Galway Fish & Chips or Blackened Tilapia but did choose the Shepherd's Pie.  When it arrived in quick time, I was happy to see it featured a generous portion of hearty chunks of beef and completely enjoyed it.  She wished she had gone for the fish because her idea of Shepherd's Pie is very English:  minced beef, vegetables and nicely browned mashed potatoes on top.  That was okay because I got to have her beef as well!  The restaurant is huge with very high, black ceilings and many flat-screen TVs overhead;  great place to head this fall for football games.  We had a pleasant, helpful server."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio!!! The food is OK, last time I went I got the hot ham and Swiss... Not easy to mess that up. They serve tater Tots here which I love so overall it was OK.   This is a pretty new spot still so I would imagine they are still working things out but overall I like the bar area and the transition bar that connects the patio to the inside bar.   Good atmosphere, good service, good location... Will update the next time I eat there and will try to order something a bit more adventurous. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Every experience I've had here has been an enjoyable one. It's a local \"neighborhood\" bar and it definitely reflects in the people who come. I've never sat anywhere but the bar, so I can't comment on all of the staff, but Cameron and Erin are the best bar duo I've ever seen. They're attentive and always remember what my husband and I like to drink. As far as some of the comments I've seen about the cleanliness... All I can say is the Nay sayers are crazy, it's always clean and I'm here almost weekly. Keep up the great work Temple, you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Best part of this local spot is the large portion of cheese curds for the price. Ask for the half and half. Pretty much two orders for the price of one. We used to hit this place more often but they removed a couple of faves from the menu like the coconut shrimp and a couple other items. Nice outside area but mainly for smokers (although two tables have a no smoking sign.)"}
{"text":"Temple Bar is AWESOME!   When you say SPORTS - Temple is the place to be.  There are more TVs than I have ever seen at a sports bar.  You will have a clear view in any location inside or out.    Speaking of in and out....  The inside is spectacular and the outside is spacious.  How upscale.  The seats inside and out are so comfy for sitting long term for games or for relaxing on a weekend.    The food is great!  I love the chips and salsa.  Bucho's Mucho Salsa is AWESOME!!!!  The chicken nachos and the smothered tots are also some of my favorites.  Actually it seems everything on the menu is great as I often go with a group of friends and we split/tasted many items.    They have a great wine selection and tasty beverages too!  Overall 5 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went to watch football games today. Games were good, beer was sort of cold, waitress was asleep on her feet and going thru the motions. Food was ok. Should have gone elsewhere! Thought service and food improved since the last time we were there, not!  Too mant other convenient places to go with cold beer and servers that do provide great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is a decent neighborhood bar in an area without a lot of choices.  It has a decent beer selection and it's cold. The food is just average bar food -  a little hit or miss. Good fries and tutor tots, but the chicken ceasar wrap is made with lunch meat.... as an example. The patio is pretty cool.  All in all, a decent place to hang out."}
{"text":"It was our first time to this establishment. Was really looking forward to it. We were seated right away, but after placing our order it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the fried boneless chicken platter. It was nothing but grease. Three large fried chicken breasts that were very thin and very thick with greasy breading. To top it all off the chicken sat on top of very greasy fries. It was just disgusting. The only positive comments I can make, or that our server was friendly and my friends tater tot's were delicious."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and food was even worse!  We had a coupon for $10 off of our bill and when we went to use it we were told it was not valid because it was happy hour even though that was not stated on the coupon. When we complained to the manager, he was extremely rude and said that he was doing us a favor by even offering a coupon and why should he pay for the extra printing cost to state it was not valid during happy hour. Unbelievable! Needless to say, their coupons are no good but neither is their service or food."}
{"text":"Great place to drink and eat! Friendly staff. I highly recommend the smash style  burgers.  Just got the \"Cuban\" it's a bad boy."}
{"text":"ordered fish & chips and fried shrimp, both were pretty bad. fish batter was soggy, coleslaw was very bland and had no flavor and fries were burnt. i will not return."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!! I had the prime rib (yes, at a sports bar) and it was as delicious as Mastro's or Durant's. Well done Temple Bar Sports Grill!! They make awesome drinks as well:)"}
{"text":"This is only a review of the food.  We went if for lunch and wanted to like this place because of the location.  The ambiance for a sports bar was pretty chill and seemed clean (for a bar).  Unfortunately, the food just sucks balls.  I ordered a roast beef with peppers and puked it up within an hour  It seriously must have been a weak old and I would equate it to chewing on some jerky (without the flavor).  The waitress was really nice but the fact that I threw up within an hour of eating means that I won't be back.   **DO NOT ORDER ANY KIND OF ROAST BEEF!!!!****"}
{"text":"I've been going to Temple for about a year now. My boyfriend and I frequent this place about once a week for after work drinks and grub.   If you're a smoker and patio aficionado this place is for you. The patio is large with plenty of seating and even has bags. There are TVs on the patio but you're better off going inside to watch the game since there's a bazillion TVs inside. In the summer they have misters which don't really do much, but they're nice for a quick cool off. In the cooler months they turn on the fire pit. The patio seems to be in some kind of transition right now. Last week there were new round picnic tables intermixed with the old furniture - not pretty but hopefully its temporary.   There's a wide range in the types of people you'll see here - families with kids seated next to Affliction bro types is not unusual. Really, everyone is welcome. They have a moderate crowd on weekdays and a somewhat larger crowd on the weekends. The only times I've seen it busting was on St. Patrick's Day and for UFC fights.  They have good selection of beer and wine (pretty pricey) and can mix up all kinds of cocktails. Happy hour specials are great. When you order shots, be sure to specify if you want it chilled or room temp because they will come chilled. (I like my whiskey warm) Unfortunately, despite specifying I've gotten my shots chilled. Which brings me to service...  The service is spotty, hence the 4 stars. Some nights our drink orders are taken as soon as we sit down, other nights we have to flag someone down. But once you get the server's attention they will continually check up on you and are prompt with the bill. (I HATE sitting around waiting for the bill when I'm ready to leave) With the exception of the shots, they always get your order right.  I've tried a lot of their menu and everything has been good, some things are better than others but I've never had anything inedible.I particularly enjoy the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and French Dip. Their portions are generous (great for splitting!) and they serve tots! Tots people! Crunchy, baby hashbrown, potato goodness!   I'm surprised at the negative reviews since I've always had a pretty good experience there. It's not the be-all, end-all of sports bars but it does the job and get's it done well."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for Sunday football. Just make sure you get there for the early games."}
{"text":"Good food, okay selection of beer, the beer selection used to be a little better previously but there are still options. Corn Hole( bean bag) on the patio."}
{"text":"Our neighbor favorite- whether we are watching sports or just eating on the patio- it's a great casual place to hang out and relax and enjoy some drinks and good American food."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in the Valley, hands down!  Won't be making a trip there again."}
{"text":"During our winter hiatus in Scottsdale we frequented Temple Bar several times, both evening and afternoons.  We always had very good service, ample and tasty portions of meals, great drinks.  The patio area is great and the Bag Toss area is a hoot.  The shuttle is above and beyond making the entire experience safe and sane.  We'll be back for more in Nov"}
{"text":"Food Was Delicious!  Great Outdoor Patio with beautiful view of the McDowell Mountains. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is close to where I used to work, so it was on the list of places to go for lunch or staff happy hour.  For some reason, it always seriously underwhelmed me.  Very dark, like it might be hiding dirt, the food passable and the service spotty."}
{"text":"First few times were great.  Last couple of times were terrible.  The grilled chicken had a terrible taste.  I took it home and my dog wouldn't even eat it.  Beer was flat."}
{"text":"To the locals, Temple is good, but nothing to get excited about.  For someone from a place like Danville, CA, Temple is off the charts!  I would eat at Temple 7 days/week if it were here, but it's not, so all I can do is dream about those tater tots.  Holy crap this place is GOOD!"}
{"text":"It's a great neighborhood pub with an enormous amount of TV's to watch your team play."}
{"text":"I work up in North Scottsdale, and when I heard a quaint Irish type pub opened relatively close by, I was pretty happy.  While I wouldn't call it a honeymoon, the Tempe Sports Bar & Grill has definitely not lived up to my expectations.  First & foremost, if you are going to have Irish shwag (and they have great Irish decorations), learn how to pour a Guinness PROPERLY!  Seriously, it should be like training 101, and while I have not been trained properly at the brewery at St. Jame's Gate, there are a few simple things I know need to happen.  1) Use the proper glass! 2) Pour rougly 2/3-3/4 of the beer & let it rest 3) Then top it off... Don't pour me an over-flowing, sloppy beer...\ 4) For goodness sake, take your time. This is a craft!  Beer rants aside, I've actually eaten here a few times, and the food, albeit bar food, has been their saving grace.  Their portion sizes are good, and the quality is high.  Plus, and this may seem ironic since I care so much about my beer, but they serve tater tots!  Who doesn't love tater tots!??  The service here can be a bit spotty at times, but most of the servers are very friendly.  Finally, they have a great TV set-up to watch all types of sports games, but if you do go, don't forget to people watch during commerical breaks.  There are some fun people who randomly come and go...  This place is a good happy hour joint to grab a quick bite at or eat there before you head out golfing... There are better Irish pubs though..."}
{"text":"As far as sports bars go, this might be my favorite. Fantastic atmosphere, more than enough high-quality screens. Truly not a bad seat in the house. Added benefit is the phenomenal patio -- one of the best bar patios in town for sure. I've been there twice in the past week to watch Suns playoff games. Food is very good for bar food. First night was just 5-6 shared appetizers (wings, potato skins, chicken quesadilla, etc. - you know the stuff for us health nuts). Everything was fantastic. The second night we had the prime rib, mashed potatoes and asparagus dinner. Only $12 and it was great. After we had the skillet cookie which was one of the best things I've ever tasted -- I will get that every time I go no matter what. ;-) The only drawback was the wait staff. Was hard to get a drink a few times. Other than that, fantastic experience and we will be back regularly."}
{"text":"** Update 4/12/08**  The reason I moved my star rating down to 2 is because the food is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! And I left it at a 2 rating because the bar is actually nice for cocktails ONLY!  I took my friends there for some beers and food and thought it would be fun because they are in town from England....Since when are fish and chips that are supposed to be \"beer battered\" cooked with Italian bread crumbs?????  The chips where regular french fries!, not wedges.  The macaroni and cheese was also terrible!  The patio is dog friendly, so if I go back, I absolutely will never order food there!    Attention folks that live in  McDowell Mountain Ranch and DC Ranch...  We finally have a sports pub!!! Temple Bar Sports Grill opened on Friday January 18.  I only had a chance to grab a quick cocktail...but the Temple Bar Sports Grill looks like and has the feel of my new favorite neighborhood pub!  Huge Patio with a soon to be installed fire pit....  Here is what they had to say about themselves, and I must agree! (I have not tried the food yet):  \"What do you want to do tonight?\" That question has finally been answered with the opening of Temple Bar Sports Grill - the newest neighborhood sports lounge in North Scottsdale that has an upscale atmosphere with a laid-back attitude.  We have delicious food, friendly staff, a full bar with 12 beers on tap, 23 HDTV's, and late-night music and dancing on weekends - all with a little Irish flair.  Whether the question is \"Where do you want to eat for lunch?\", \"What's for dinner?\", \"Where should we meet for drinks?\", or \"Where should we watch the game?\" - Temple Bar is the answer. Come hang out with us for lunch, dinner, or happy hour, meet friends and make new ones, or watch the big game on one of our TVs."}
{"text":"I visited Temple Bar Sports Grill with a friend on a whim for NYE 2015. We had been hanging out at home, then decided food was in order. My friend was already familiar with Temple Bar, but this little holiday visit was my first. (And I'm aaaaaaall about those firsts, baby!)  DISCLAIMER  To be brutally honest, I'm not typically a huge fan of the pub experience. In my experience, food tends to be over-portioned and bland and the overall atmosphere can tend to be somewhat noisy and obnoxious.  ABOUT THE VISIT  I am HAPPY to report that such was not at all the case at Temple Bar. My friend and I arrived around 10:00p or so and the place was pretty empty apart from us. We were immediately and cheerfully greeted and welcomed to sit wherever we liked.  Once seated, we were once again greeted and served menus by Brittany (hopefully I'm spelling your name correctly!), a very sweet girl who also happened to be tending bar. Brittany remained very polite and attentive throughout the course of our stay.  We ordered a couple drinks and then both decided on the Hangover Dip hot sandwich to soak up the booze. The food came surprisingly quickly and was WAY more tasty than I could have possibly anticipated! -- I would actually go back just for that sandwich, no lie. --  As the night progressed, more and more people began to show up. The space was plenty large enough to accommodate, though, without getting noisy or claustrophobic, and somehow Brittany still managed to check in with us regularly despite the busier workload.  At one point early on in our stay, my friend wanted the tv channel changed to \"anything but football\". Brittany was very quick to oblige and enlisted the help of a coworker to get the channel changed for us. (They gave us our choice of whatever we wanted to watch.)  CONCLUSION  Overall, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised with the experience at Temple Bar. The mathematics of its spacious interior, the phenomenal service, and the tasty food just added up to a really pleasant dining experience. It was pretty perfect.  If you haven't been to Temple Bar and you find yourself in the area with an empty stomach, I would absolutely recommend that you stop by, ask for Brittany, and order up a Hangover Dip with a side of fries like we did! You won't be let down!  :)  SPECIAL THANKS  Brittany, thank you for being such a wonderful hostess. You got dealt the short stick having to work NYE, and you handled it with a grace and positivity that flowed really beautifully into our night as well. I really appreciated that. Major props to you!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went for a UFC this past weekend. No UFC cover which is always nice. Nice, large outdoor patio with good TV's (sound could've been louder). Good atmosphere with firepit and a giant Jenga game!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this bar I just moved to the  neighborhood an there are not a lot of options an from what I had read seemed pretty cool ! Well wrong couldn't get service if my life depended on it , in fact   the bartender looked at us an turned her back like she was to good to serve us, they weren't very busy or I would understand,we were sitting at the bar might I mention !  ! Her loss an the restaurant I might not look like I have a lot of money but I am a great tipper an patron !  after not getting served a drink or any food we had to leave ...hungry an disappointed not to mention thirsty !!"}
{"text":"This place rocks... it's a Chicago bar, and they also have the cornhole game...I'm kind of a legend when it comes to that game, I won the Best Damn Bags League tourney there a while back.  Great food, good drinks and nice staff.  It also has a huge outdoor patio which is awesome when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I heard that temple bar served tater tots smothered in cheese and bacon.  For this I thought it would be worth it to go to temple.    Well the first time I went there the bartender told me he had sent home the cook.  At the *restaurant* he had sent home the *cook.*  restaurant but no cook?    So we had drinks and I got a vodka cran so red that there's a crayola in the works that will have the words \"temple bar vodka cran red\" emblazoned on its wrapper.    One week later, we show up again to tb (appropriately the same acronym as an infectious disease) and are told that they just changed the schedule and no food is available!  Foiled again!    Well fortunately I had gotten in my order before the bad news came and I had the smothered tots. I was underwhelmed--not enough cheese, bacon that was too sweet... ftr the saying is *under*promise and *over*deliver, not the goddamn reverse, ppl.   And the waitress was very confused as to how to handle a large group, with the check and what not.  Well maybe she should worry about how she'd pay her bills without customers?  Food for thought.    Save your trip.  Go to zipps or wherever, doesn't matter to me."}
{"text":"Temple's 1-year anniversary last Wednesday was great - all the regulars plus a ton of people that come from time to time.  It was a good time, crowded but not too much so (never an issue getting a drink - and those free beers until 8 kindof snuck up on me - dangerous mid-week!)."}
{"text":"Website says 10 dollar bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's and the waitress said she couldn't honor it because it's not a special anymore so she sent her manager over, and he was being condescending saying he doesn't create the website and says it was a special this summer to bring people in and they ended the special when football started (it's week 3), no kidding, that's why we came in because the website still has the special (false advertise much?) He didn't do anything to be accommodating and has an \"answer\" for everything as if he right about everything, very unprofessional. The waitress then was non attentive and slow, very bad experience from what I've experienced in the past. Back to the manager with his power trip and grin he kept flashing off while looking our way, if this is what you call customer service.. Probably won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Busy night, not enough servers, had to ask for water 5 times. Fish and chips greasy with too much batter. Quesadilla with chicken was good. Was hoping for more as it is close to home."}
{"text":"I love this hole in the wall! Great fries, sweet bartenders and family friendly! The patio is great and they are doggie friendly too! Love it here in the fall and winter!"}
{"text":"Ok so you know that feeling of hunger where you're stomach is on the verge of digesting itself? Yea, that's how I was feeling today -- starvin' Marvin status. I drove to a different place before here (that was closed due to scheduling conflicts until 3pm -- great lunch place, right? NOT!)  I was getting quite frustrated as I didn't know where to go... An then as I was about to cry, Temple Bar saved me! Ah, Temple Bar, you've been so good to me in my younger years (and today) when I lived down the street; I've missed you!   I parked and walked in and immediately felt at home, having a lot of great memories flood my mind just being here. I was happily greeted at the bar by Eddie as I sat down and requested a menu to place my to-go order. Eddie gave me a menu and pointed out some items on the menu -- and I chose a super yummy grilled chicken sandwich (sorry, I don't remember the name) with tator tots. Mmm... tator tots!   While my food was being prepared, I chatted with Eddie and told him how I used to love coming to Temple Bar when I lived in the area, and how many great memories I made there. As Eddie was helping other guests that came in after me and their food was coming out of the kitchen, I thought it quite strange that Eddie hadn't dropped my check yet. I waited patiently though.  Then Eddie brought my food -- ah! The glorious moment of having food in hand, fresh out of the kitchen and ready to dig in. I went for my wallet to pay and Eddie just looked at me and told me \"you're good\" -- now, I was confused by this. Huh? I asked for my check, and was told that I was taken care of today... and \"welcome back\". what?! Seriously?! I thanked Eddie from the bottom of my heart and good thing I walked away when I did 'cause tears started welling up in my eyes. I'm still blown away by the kindness, generosity, hospitality, and unexpected wonderful gesture by Eddie.   The food was just as amazing as I expected it to be, btw. The sammy I got was so ooey gooey, and the sauce, chicken, spices were on point! The tator tots -- well, we all know tator tots are amazing so nothing new there. I will absolutely be back to Temple Bar... I'm kind of sad that I let so much time go by without going there."}
{"text":"Whelp. Once was enough for me. The food was fine, nothing to write home about (western burger, sliders, loaded tater tots). I was disappointed with my flat soda ... that came from a can? So it was probably open and sitting on the bar for hours. The service was AWFUL. We obviously offended the bartenders with our faces as soon as only one of us ordered an alcoholic drink but you would have thought the 15 people in the bar AND restaurant areas was actually 150.  I usually feel bad about flagging down bartenders or servers as they walk by me but we had no other option.  We couldn't get them to come over to our corner of the bar at all.  Now, if you're a regular, you're going to keep supremo service because those were the only customers the two bartenders were talking with (you can always tell a regular ...).  It was so frustrating. Example of the bad service?  Bartender took our drink orders and then about 15-20 minutes later we had to flag her down to order food (it was 6:30 pm ... yes, we were there for dinner).  We were all ready to order apps and dinner but she heard my loaded tater tots order, turned and walked away.  What what what??? Hey you, come back! We weren't done!! It wasn't until after the tater tots came out (10-15 min) that we got a chance to order our dinner.  And forget about the empty water glasses sitting on the edge of the bar --- we didn't want refills on those :-\"}
{"text":"In today's day and age, with the popularity of sites like Yelp, you have to feel bad for the sports bar proprietor.  They all seem to follow a standard formula yet at the same time there are so many ways to potentially upset your customers.  \"The game I want to watch isn't on\"....\"the sound of the game I want to hear isn't on\"....\"the big TV is showing the wrong game\".... \"the volume of the game is too loud\"... \"why are you playing music when MY team is playing on TV?\" I could go on and on.   And then you have the food. Charge more than $8 for a quesadilla and you are waaaay over priced. Charge less than $8 and put the food in a plastic basket and your establishment is \"trashy\" or \"cheap\".   You also have all those weekly specials and happy hour deals. More variables that can piss someone off.    Bottom line - for a sports bar, let me repeat that..., for a SPORTS BAR Temple Bar does a pretty good job. 4 stars. The game I wanted to watch was on several of their HD flat screen TV's. One of those TV's was close enough for me to follow the action. The sound was a bit loud but I could still hear my friends talk. The menu featured several decent $5 apps for happy hour. The food was greasy, most likely from pre-packaged frozen supplies and I don't feel very healthy anymore, but it was no worse than any other fried food I have had at a run of the mill sports bar.  Most important of all, my friends and I shared some laughs, had a good time, and I'm definitely full.   Oh - and the bathrooms were clean. Another plus."}
{"text":"First time for wife and I. Thought we'd try it based on previous good Yelp reviews.  I got the burger and fries which was a standard bar burger, not spectacular but typical sports pub burger, that's what i expected, it was ok. Wife got the rubber chicken. Not acceptable.  Silver ware did not appear clean.  Table tops were filmy. Maybe it's just the hardwater around here. Server was responsive, but there's only so much he can do.  Management needs to take responsibility for appearances and food quality. The bar was crowded: maybe the money is made on drinks and food is secondary. On the plus side, good beer and wine selections, surrounded by TVs showing sports."}
{"text":"Great place! Super friendly bar staff.  Food was outstanding and not typical bar food. Front entrance a little goofy to figure out, but other than that would highly recommend."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I was here with a group of friends and we were having 5 star fun that night. So even if we were in a 7-11, I'd rate it 4 stars. That said, Temple Bar is a nice, open sports bar that seems to attract the beautiful people I normally don't see in establishments of this type in my neck of the woods.   For as crowded as it was that night, I think the servers did a good job. The drinks were cold and we got them relatively quickly.   The icing on the cake for us was that we brought a band to party with us (thanks to Ted for arranging this!). They're a cool local band called Safety Orange (check 'em out sometime if you get a chance!). Great fun."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have always had a good experience.  The place was clean with a nice outdoor area.  I was there for football Saturday this past weekend, and the service was very good.  I would give five stars, except that the person with me didn't love their sandwich.  I liked my food though!  I will definitely visit the Tempe Bar again."}
{"text":"Awesome food, their cheese curds are the bomb!!! Great drinks, great food at a decent price. Lots of energy, especially when there is any games being played on their t.v.s  If you want a fun local place to go to, check out Temple!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. My tip for temple bar would be to limit the UFC fights during football games. ASU was about to start and they turned on a couple of TVs. I had to request this at a \"local\" sports bar. No one wants to hear UFC and not hear anything else. You've lost our business. Take notes from Zipps"}
{"text":"My family and I live down the street and come here often, great happy hour items and friendly service!"}
{"text":"A fine establishment I suppose, but the least good for after hockey booze, in my opinion. If you're just a normal not hockey person, and you like neighborhood bars generally, you'll like this place just fine."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch any sport, cool open patio, awesome location. Food was decent had the Cajun Wings and the Coconut Chicken. Worth going to and I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! I called this place to ask if they had TVs on the outside patio, and they said yes. What they failed to mention was that they only have two tvs, and one of them was not working properly. Staff was incredibly rude and not receptive. Horrendous!"}
{"text":"Great large patio, plenty of big screens inside, great \"bar\" food.  Bartenders are decent though the waitresses can be a bit slow if you're at a table.  Okay prices.  Happy a hour isn't anything to brag about.  I have been here several times and they just recently changed a few of their draft beer selections.... No longer have Hoegaarden (my fav) and don't carry a hefeweizen unless you consider Blue Moon a hefeweizen which it is not...  Overall I'd give it a 3.5, but the service knocks it down to three.  My suggestion is to sit at the bar!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Sat. at 1pm, only 3 tables going and I can see why! $11 for a burger, $8 is the opening price for wine \"OUCH\" You can go down T. Peak Pky and find the real deal at ZIPP'S. Pass and spend your $$ wisely somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I originally wrote a review in August, 2010 where I suggested a number of improvements to this business.  I was impressed that management wrote me a message and addressed my concerns.  Since then we have been back to Temple Bar and would provide a higher rating.  They have improved the patio furniture, cleanliness outside, food quality, and service.  We visited Friday night and were very happy with the experience.  And, I am always a fan of the huge selection of draught beer.  It is nice to have a neighborhood restaurant that we will be happy to revisit."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. I've been here a few times and would have to say for every time I enjoy my visit the next couple of times I don't enjoy my visit. Maybe I'm cranky because for the last 3 nights in a row I've been less than happy with my venue choices.  My wife was hungry and wanted to order right away but I insisted that we get our drinks first. It's been my experience that if you order your drinks and meal at the same time, it takes forever to get your drinks. Especially since there were only two servers working during a packed house during Monday night football. Sure enough, it took some time to get our drinks, but at least our server was easy on the eyes and seemed to care about her customers.  The food is sometimes good but it's normally not the greatest. I wanted to try a burger but our server said that they couldn't guarantee medium so I decided to get a Reuben. The Reuben was passable but I forgot to ask them not to put so much freaking thousand island on the sandwich. Don't get their Philly sandwich, the last time I had it, it tasted like it was expired. They at least replaced the Philly sandwich with another item.  I think the best way to enjoy Temple Bar is to only drink the adult beverages while sitting out on the gorgeous patio."}
{"text":"It is a sports bar with reasonable charges for food and drink. The food however is your typical bar food and nothing seems all too fresh. I had the turkey burger and my hubby had a chicken sandwich. Both tasted like they had come from the freezer and thrown on a grill. The tater tots tasted like they had been over fried, refried or the oil needed to be changed. I think the kitchen cuts corners which is a real shame because I like the atmosphere there."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant, I have been coming here for years and I love it. The food is ok, but the staff is excellent, it's a awesome place to hang out, have a drink and enjoy the games.   Thank you guys for fun friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went here to watch UFC one night. The place is nice! Pretty big with outdoor and indoor seating. We got sat right away and the service was great.    I can't say much for the food because we just got drinks there. However, it was a good experience and I have no complaints.  It is a nice place and very clean.  My boyfriend loved trying some of the many beers they have there as well!"}
{"text":"Are you a beer aficionado?  And by beer, I don't mean Michelob Ultra or any of those tasteless, flavorless low-calorie 'beers'. I'm talking about IPA's.  Those extraordinary flavorful, aromatic brews offering double the taste, aroma and  alcohol content of mainstream beers. Well Temple Bar is for you.   Here you'll find a new selection from Lagunitas, a seasonal selection named 'Lagunitas Sucks'. I had three mason jars of this fine spirited brew and got my dick knocked right into the dirt.  SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't suck but it does tend to knock dicks in the dirt.  Temple Bar also features some of the best wings I've ever had, but you won't find them on the menu. You'll need to ask for them by name; JT's Favorites.  Apparently, there's some guy in the kitchen named JT, or maybe Justin Timberlake wandered in one day and ordered his wings grilled, then deep-fried till crispy.  They were magical. I ordered them hot.  Big mistake, go with medium. Aside from being a culinary artist, JT, (if that IS his real name) is also a sadomasochist, taking ghoulish delight in making sure hot truly means hot.  Between the Lagunitas and JT's nuclear wings, my head exploded right on the spot.   This freaked-out other pub-goers and the staff, making an otherwise peaceful evening a dreadful folly.  As I lay there, my head in a million tiny pieces on the floor, I noticed my fellow patrons curiously asking the bartender what of this fatal combination? It wasn't long before heads were exploding all around me. All of us laid-out on the floor, gibbering messes, the lot of us.    Lagunitas Sucks and JT's wings. A fitting end to a fucked-up day at work.  If you like hot wings, good IPA's and free popcorn or, if you don't particularly care if your head explodes, I strongly recommend Temple Bar."}
{"text":"Temple Bar! I have had many late night adventures here, some good, some bad, but i can tell u the bartenders r cool as fuck!! and fuck is pretty cool.lol Pete, Jason, and Ashley r all very nice and hook up the drinks perfectly! the only reason y i give it 4 stars is because when there's no happy hour everything is too pricey and i have also gotten in a lot of trouble after leaving this place. I will say though i have been 86'd out of this place about 9 times and they always welcome me back with funny stories reminding me of how much of a dumb ass this Lil schmuck can be! The UFC fights r always free, which is very hard to find in Scottsdale. The place is never consistent with customers, one day it will look like a fucking Raging club the next night it will look like, the outside of chuckee cheese( 6 pedophiles hiding in the shadows). I do like that they have bags there or poop chute or butt darts and beef swords or whatever u call throwing a bean bag, its a good game to play with a few drinks, reason i say few is because last time i had too many and played, i threw a fucking bean bag at someones table and spilled all there drinks(DUMBASS) all and all it is a pretty chill place to go when they have happy hour but don't expect too much, unless you live by the place"}
{"text":"This is my kind of sport's bar! Good food, good atmosphere, good pricing and plenty of TVs for the sport's fan. There is plenty of seating both inside and outside and it appeared to be much smaller on the outside then it actually is on the inside.   During a recent visit, we started with the hangover hummus which is spicy hummus and then I had the Sonoran burger with avocado. I would say that the food is a couple steps above normal bar food and this is very similar to a Zipps. It's the perfect spot to bring a group and have a casual but entertaining night out. It's also the perfect place to watch a game if you're near the McDowell Mountain Ranch area."}
{"text":"The place is filthy, dirty bar towels on the bar, behind the bar, piled on the beer tap behind the IPA handle, pos screen has beer drippings all over it, refrigerated sliding beer doors are dirty and cracked glass, beer is coming out of taps foaming - which means it's warm, bathroom is a pigsty, I shudder to think of what the kitchen looks like if the public area is so disgusting. Ceiling fans in the restaurant have thick dust on them. Have your staff deep clean the place! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs; the meatballs were cold and tasted frozen and reheated, spaghetti was over cooked. I have to go to the Walgreens to go to the bathroom. The only redeeming quality is there are a lot of TVs all over, smaller screens, but throughout the place."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everytime we go I end up on the huge patio kicking some butt in bean bag toss!!  I've spent many fun nights here with  friends having drinks and sharing delicious dishes.  I highly recommend this bar to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean, fun place to hang for the night.  Did i mention there's a dance floor to get your groove on?"}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch one day since its right up the road from my house and I was starving! I had the Caesar wrap with tater tots and they were both SO good! The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 is because we were the only table outside and there was only 3 tables inside, with that being said - our service was not so good. We will be back though hoping for better service!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  The food is nothing to write home about.  This most recent visit I sat at the bar and had a couple beers and watched the NBA playoffs on TV.  It was a nice place to kick back for a little while."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night for a UFC fight and they had a ton of specials/weekend happy hour.  They had a ton of tv's inside and outside and they have a huge patio.  I ordered the burger and wings which were both delicious.  Our waitress was prompt and kept the beer flowing.  You can't beat free UFC, cheap drinks, good food and good service."}
{"text":"Yay, Temple now bans smoking on the outside patio!! Whoo hoo!! We definitely enjoy coming here much more so now that they've changed this policy! Great work guys! And thank you!!  Food is always good and staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great potato skins and baked cookie dessert.  Lots of TVs.   Great place to watch sports"}
{"text":"Food is average bar food, great wings, and tots. Huge patio, Lots of friendly people! Nice staff!"}
{"text":"I am going to give Temple 3 stars. Why? I have enjoyed the food there and the drink specials on reverse happy hour are great. Now Richard Z didn't enjoy the smothered tots, but I assured him it was an off night. The 3 times I have had them they have been great. Cheddar and bacon, dip them in a little ranch and you have a great late night snack. The chips and salsa are always available. Be prepared as the salsa has what I would call a lasting affect on your mouth, like a day or so. $3 beers on tap, Carlsberg and Stella being a couple of the choices, always puts a smile on my face.   This has become our late night after hockey place. Not sure how I feel about that just yet, but for now it will have to do."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  Love the cheese and bacon tater tots!  Dayamn!  Pairs quite nicely with a Grape press"}
{"text":"I came to Scottsdale on vacation to visit a friend.   A group of us visited this  bar in his neighborhood that he a visited a handful of times.  I found the food to be well above average for bar food.  I loved the sauteed cajun shrimp as a starter with the shrimp being hugh.  The sliders were also delicious.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their sandwiches.    The bar itself has a great outdoor patio where you can play bags and enjoy a view of the mountains.  We only had beers so can't judge the mixed drinks, but found the service to be quick and friendly.  Will be back when I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from the Temple bar... and there are not many other really close options to choose from in regard to a burger/beer joint.  The Temple Bar has really decent Happy Hour specials when if comes to their appetizers. They seem to be the best deals here, as everything else (in my opinion) tends to be a little overpriced.... both for the quantity and quality.   I am a big fan of the steak salad! This was really good... but at $14 for some lettuce and a piece of steak... not to sure it's worth it.  The burgers are usually good.   STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATLOAF! STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATLOAF!   STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATLOAF! STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATLOAF!  Did I make my point clear!!? The meatloaf looked and tasted like dog food! And I felt like crap for two days after eating it.  Overall... it's a good place to have a burger, have a beer and watch a game as they market themselves as a sports bar."}
{"text":"Was incredibly disappointed tonight.  Food was good - service amazing!  However - LOTS of false advertising and bait and switch.  So - I looked on the website for their daily special before going - Listed Thursday night football specials and what they were.  I get it no football now  - but since it was still on their website assumed it was still going.  WRONG.  We had an expired groupon - I know the rules for groupon - we don't get full value - only what we paid.  WELL - Manager tonight didn't like we used during happy hour.  Mind you - our first groupon with them - we used for happy hour - NO ISSUES.  I was told by the waitress (who was great) - every manager is different and he won't budge.  So while he exepted the face value - he then upcharged us everything on happy hour as it *didn't apply*.  I've already sent groupon on email.  Very disappointed!  We hadn't been there is a long time - most likely - won't be there for a while.  Oh ya - tried to charge us for adult drinks for my kids in which drinks are included in the kids meals.  When I questioned this - they did take it off - but said well I gave them the bigger glasses?  That's great - but I didn't ask for that - we clearly ordered the kids meals - and my kids didn't even finish the drinks!  Sigh - Temple - please don't make any assumptions and please honor what you have 1) advertised via your website or b) committed to via groupon.  Very disappointed!  I only gave 2 stars due to food was good and server was great (expect for omission on drink issue)."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with a pal, and the service was horrible!  We walked in and the place was surprisingly busy yet eerily quiet.  The place had this weird muted vibe about it.  We wanted to sit at a booth but the only one open was covered with remnants of a messy family dinner (I guess Tuesday nights are \"kids eat free night\")  We asked the first frazzled server we spotted (turns out there were only 2 for the whole joint) if we could sit there and she gave us a \"half-irritated/half-please-be-nice-to-me-I-hate-my-job-tonight-look.\"  We proceeded to sit at a high-top and waited for the table to be cleared. About 10 minutes later, the server asked us for our drink orders and said she'd be back to wipe down the table.  About that time, a group of four comes in and makes a bee-line for the booth we'd been waiting for!  Luckily, my dining pal is quite confident and quickly put the kibosh on that!   We then decide to stake our claim at the still-unwiped table.  I'm starving at this point, so I head over to the free popcorn machine for a little snack.  Upon my return, I find out my friend has just wiped the table herself with a wet rag!  According to my friend, people who've worked in the service industry before do that type of thing!? At this point, no drinks but at least we're at the cleaned table.  We discuss getting up and leaving and heading over to Zipps.  Alas, our server delivers our drinks and we put in order right away.  Food took awhile to come out, but we had some catching up to do so it wasn't a major issue at that point.   I ordered the baked chicken tenders coated in a corn flake and pecan crust.  They were served with a side of honey mustard.  They were actually pretty darn good!  Four substantially-sized boneless chicken breasts that were baked to perfection!  They didn't come out with a side dish, which I thought was a little weird, since other things on the menu stated there was a choice of a side salad, onion rings, fries, Irish stew (interesting!), etc.  Out of curiosity, I asked the server if my dish was missing anything.  She told me, No, they didn't but offered to bring me a kids' side of fries.  Great, I'll take them!  To my surprise, she brought out 2 kids' sides, fries and some mac & cheese.  I thought that was pretty cool of her, but the fries were mediocre at best (cold and soggy) and the mac & cheese was  straight out of a Kraft box. My friend ordered the steak salad.  I didn't bother to taste it, but she said it wasn't so great.  The menu called it \"sizzling\" steak salad I believe, but nothing on this salad was sizzling or even warm.  Even the \"sauteed\" onions and mushrooms were oddly cold. All in all, Temple Bar scored 2 stars because the baked chicken tenders were actually quite yummy, but otherwise, I will not returning to this place!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, prices were expensive for the amount and quality. Water was never refilled but the server was very nice. My chicken tenders and fries were over cooked but still edible. Tater toys were very oils but ok. Side salad was nice good veggies. I prob would not come back due to the price"}
{"text":"Positives:  Very good food, particularly for a \"bar\" Great beer selection Best onion rings in the state Pretty good service Reasonable prices Don't charge entry fee for UFC  Negatives:  TV setup not optimal, particularly outside where it is pathetic Surging popularity means it's harder to get seats for big events Patio area is always very dirty  Overall, a pretty good place.  Update 8-2011: They upgraded the seating outside and it's much better than it used to be.  However, they also changed the menu and don't have the beers listed anymore so now you have to rely on the waitresses to list them all (which they never do).  One of the best things about this place is the unique beers they have but now I can't see a list.  Not sure why they changed the menu - seems silly to me."}
{"text":"When it comes to meatballs, Nancy's Grandma makes the best. But when you can't get those...  Temple Bar is as close as it gets.  Let's just say those delectable 3 inch spheres of yummy ness are awesome!"}
{"text":"Save yourself, DO NOT go here!  See AMber W. - place is empty, you provide a service that results in tips, it's a recession, be lucky you have a job, how 'bout you be a little nicer?!?!?   Her review was almost a year ago, well they haven't changed!    This is the third time I've been here and each time it's worse!    My boyf enjoys the herb crusted burger, it's not bad.  But, to have to put up with sourpuss jerks, NOPE, not fabulous enough!!!  I had a burger, nothing to write home about...  And, along with very dismal depressing servers & bartenders, it stinks like a night after a chorus of Englishmen singing rugby songs till morn were there (it stinks every time we've been there), and the wonky unstable chairs, and the not so great pricing, please find a reason why you should hurt yourself by going to this awful dwelling!  This is a review from three separate spaced apart visits, one lunch, one an event, one dinner, I've earned the right to give this place negative stars, dammit, I can't...!  Oh, and by the way, the tots are NOT good x 3!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here to get some lunch after waiting over 30 min for just a menu at Eli's. We were here at Temple one other time and had great food and did this time too. Found a table and were waited on right away.  I had to order their Reuben sandwich. It's so good...not too salty like most places and their tots are great tasting too. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Made it over there on Thursday after work for the Grand Opening.  I must say I was impressed with the atmosphere of the place.  Clean and modern but without the overpowering attempt at being trendy that plagues most Scottsdale locales.  Just a nice relaxed bar that happens to have some of my favorite beers on tap.  That fact that these favorites of mine were being given away for free much of the night of the opening was a definite plus.   Unfortunately I did not get the opportunity to try any of their food as they weren't serving anything from their menu for the opening.     Although I live a few blocks south of the Ranch I definitely see myself and friends returning to this place.  I hope it catches on and achieves its goal of becoming a great neighborhood haunt for us Nordale folks."}
{"text":"Tots tots tots what else can you ask for??? Oh yeah best beer selection at this local spot the staff is friendly and the food is delish overall a very satisfied customer!  Somebody beer me!"}
{"text":"Try the baked wings with the oriental seasonings.   Awesome and healthy.  Great tequila selection and friendly service.  Cold beer could be priced better but good."}
{"text":"Came for a beer to watch the cardinals game. Our waitress was really great so must be hit and miss from the other reviews. The other one there didn't look so happy so glad we got the one we did. Think her name was jenny.  She suggested a new beer called 312 and I thought it was a pretty good recommendation. Can't say what the food was like so that will be next time.   I love the fact that they have so many TVs so you've got a great angle anywhere you sit."}
{"text":"For a Sports Bar the food we had was excellent. Can recommend the Meat Loaf and the Beef Hot Sandwich. I also tried a very yummy Pinot Noir from Oregon, however $13.50 did seem a little high for a glass.  The staff were very nice, helpful, fast and friendly. It seemed to be a good place for the regulars who were all sitting around the bar at 4pm on a Tuesday. We had not intended to stop here but had little luck finding lunch at 3pm! A random spy while driving down the road. Glad we did stop though as we enjoyed our meal. The lighting is just a tad too dark though."}
{"text":"Showed up one evening for food to go and there wasn't a single employee in the building. One finally came from the patio and took my order. I asked for extra tzatziki  sauce for my gyro. I was given my food and checked to make sure my extra sauce made it in, there was no sauce at all. Again no employee anywhere... So I went into the kitchen and asked the chef for sauce to go.   Food was ok. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"I happen to go to Temple Bar a lot and i must say this place just keeps getting better and better.  They now have a new menu and the food is delicious, you must try the Cobb Salad for it's to die for.  I love the staff, who, in spite of other reviews, are some of the friendliest servers I have ever met.  And it really has that Cheers Bar type feel.  It gets pretty crowded late night and i have definetly had to wait for a table for the dinner rush can be crazed.  We went for the NHL finals and the place was packed, the patio is also amazing and the views are incredible.  Have Pete make your drink, he's the best bartender in town!"}
{"text":"I've been there in the past and enjoyed but after this past Saturday night, we wont be back.  Service was horrible food was ok."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great personal service. Different soups everyday, all great. I love the chili, not too hot but a ton of flavor. Plus my favorite wings in town, try them Temple Style. Oh, and most important... Ice cold beer! Dutch~"}
{"text":"Two stars for Temple should be extreme flattery.  I just want to remind everyone that as of Tuesday night, we are still in a recession. People are looking for work, companies are going out of business left and right, middle class families are living on the street. What does this mean, you ask?  Well, it means if I come into your eating and drinking establishment with fifteen others, you should be excited that your damn bar is getting business and that you will walk out with some cash in your pocket.  Is that what happened? No  We got terrible service. Our waitress was really snappy and rude, complaining before we even sat down about splitting checks. She took a few orders first and then came back later to take the rest while informing us that they were no longer serving food. If she would have said that in the beginning, maybe everyone would have had a chance to order before the kitchen closed.  The \"smothered\" tater tots were basically just sprinkled with cheese.  This was a huge disappointment because I love cheese.  The only redeeming thing about this place was the fact that they had good reverse happy hour specials.  Temple - if you want repeat customers, treat them a little better. Especially since you are in WAY northeast Scottsdale and people are not just going to accidentally run into you."}
{"text":"It's unfair to rate the service based on one St. Patrick's Day visit, so I won't tell you about how our waitress forgot to bring me water and took 15 minutes to fetch a draught.  That said, the fries were good and my sister-in-law said the sliders were good too (as served with au jus?).  Also, I think the tanktop-clad, eye contact-avoiding DJ from last night is from Jersey Shore. Could be wrong."}
{"text":"Found this place last night on bringfido.com, I was in the area and had my dog with me so needed a place that was pet friendly. The ONLY good thing about this place was the large pet friendly patio area. We sat for a long time before even being acknowledged. In the dozen times a server walked by, not a single \"be right with you\" No drink refills After asking for a box, she began to place other customers dirty plates on top of my boyfriends plate making a comment like \"if you say you didn't like it I can take it off your bill.\" I had to stop her from laying dirty dishes on our food and explained that we would be taking the food home if she brought a box.   I could go on and on but will sum it up like this:   Terrible service, possibly worst ever.  The food was so-so.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection. Lagunitas seems to be a favorite of many, plus it comes in a cool mason jar glass. Bonus!  I have been to \"Temple\" many times and never had any issues with service, outside of the occasional new server.  The staff that has been around for awhile does a great job.  From a food standpoint I tend to stick to the appetizer menu as I'm often just having a beer and lite meal.  The hot pretzel is a good option, but I'm a huge fan of the basic nachos.  Think standard chips and cheese like you would get at the ball park, but a little higher quality.  If you like tater tots don't pass on them here! Excellent.  The have a huge patio which is great when the weather is good, i.e not 100 plus degrees, service is sometimes slower on the patio as well.  They also have a ton of flat screen TVs that allow you to have a decent view from anywhere you sit.  Highly recommended for a good beer and a decent meal."}
{"text":"Temple-style Hot Wings are a must to try.  The burgers are very good, albeit lack a certain 'punch'/'kick' to make them 'oh wow' good.  A nice tall Guinness, sitting on the patio with a clear view to the mountains is wonderful.  Hockey seems to be the big sport at this bar, followed by college football, and pro basketball.  Occasionally we'll join a game of bean bag toss in the courtyard area.  We've returned a couple dozen times in the last year."}
{"text":"Love the Food and the Staff. This place is hands down the best place in N Scottsdale to watch UFC fights ( No Cover ) Plus they have a free shuttle that will pick you up and take you home for a safe night. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great views, great bartenders, good place to get drinks.  Food was ok"}
{"text":"We were looking for a small place close to home to watch the UFC 182 fights.  Their website said they have the fights.  Went there to watch UFC and when we arrive there's a note on the door that due to lack of interest and cost they will not be showing the UFC fight.  Maybe they should be updating their website more often.  Didn't even stay to try the food."}
{"text":"I'm proud to say this is now my favorite neighborhood bar. It is an upscale sports bar with an Irish theme and a huge outdoor patio. I love the shuttle that picks me up and gets me home responsibly.  The atmosphere here is very casual and you are always made to feel welcome.   Last night (Sunday) they offered $3 you-call-it drinks all night (seriously, $3 for premium cocktails!) This is now THE place in north Scottsdale to watch a game and \"toss some bags\".  FYI - Food snobs WILL NOT like this place. They offer reasonably priced good quality bar food - not fancy ass romantic dinners. And as I have mentioned here on Yelp before, save the one-star reviews for Denny's, Jack in the Box, and the iHop in Afghanistan you snotty \"my check was 5-min late\" drama queens!  FREE SHUTTLE RIDES WITHIN A 5-MILE RADIUS!!!"}
{"text":"I have to encourgage everyone who's reviewed this place so far to GO BACK ON SUNDAY NIGHT. We wanted something close to the house and hadn't been here before. To heck with what the other reviewers have said we wanted to experience bad food for ourselves.  Well, it's not THAT bad. On Sunday evening's they have a Prime Rib special for 12 bucks! That's right, a HUGE portion of Prime Rib, Veggies and Mashed Potatoes for 12 bucks! Where else in Scottsdale can you get Prime Rib for 12 bucks? Nowhere I tell you, nowhere!!!  Okay, was it the BEST Prime Rib I've ever had? NO, but how much was it? 12 bucks, did you get that? ONLY 12 bucks.  I think I made my point. Oh and by the way, you better be hungry the portions are HUGE and only....12 bucks!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite patio's for a bar in the valley. Sitting outside at sunset, looking at the McDowell Mtns is a great reminder of  why we live in Arizona.  The food here is really good.  I especially like the Shepherd's Pie. They have a great selection of booze. Nice single malt line-up and Boddington's and Smithwick's on Tap.  They have two sets of Corn-Hole Toss games on the patio.  Really, really fun to play. Watch out for the occasional hustler looking to drink for free off of your lack of corn-hole toss skills.  Soon they are suppose to have a shuttle service to give you a ride home. Once that is in place it will seal the deal as one of my top 3 bars in the valley."}
{"text":"My 2 major factors when looking for a great sports bar (for NFL Sundays specifically) are good TV set up and good food. This place delivered both. I was able to watch every game that was on from my seat at the bar which was very convenient. I started off with a Bloody Mary and I must say, it was the best Bloody Mary that I've had to date at an AZ sports bar. I asked for extra spicy and they actually turned up the heat for reals (most bartenders don't understand extra spicy at least for my taste), yummy. Their menu has a great array of items that I will definitely be returning to try more of, everyone swears by their smothered tater tots. I tried the baked chicken tenders and they were actually very tasty. Baked instead of fried, covered in pecan and corn flakes. They tasted just as good as the real thing and were less greasy. After eating, I stepped outside to their big patio and played some bags. They have a great set up out there and a beautiful mountain backdrop. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here one hot September day. Dogs allowed!! BIG BONUS FOR ME! I have two pitbulls and one mixed saluki breed-- and i brought 2 dogs that day.. everyone loved them..  My friends and i watched the game here with our dogs, friendly staff, friendly patrons. Food looked good (i didnt eat anything) a bit pricey though..  I would come back when i have more money (and i do live pretty far, 40 miles, from here)  oh wellsie.."}
{"text":"This bar is one of my favorite joints. Alex and Brit are stellar and always have a great smile! I'm not a regular but I'm getting there. Food is good, well it's no Ruth Chris but definitely gets the job done!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!  Awesome staff. Great neighborhood hang out.  Food good drinks even better."}
{"text":"Come in expecting bar food and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Awesome fresh tater tots and chicken salad sandwich, although the Chicken noodle soup is a bit salty. $7-10 for most menu items, though the salads step up the price slightly.  Tons of tv's to watch the games and they're all marked with mini pennant magnets so you know who is playing on each. Also, looks like there's a paddy wagon to transport you to and from your house as AZ has a zero tolerance for drinking and driving.  M-W is reverse happy hour from 10 P.M."}
{"text":"Temple bar has great food but the management is a joke and seems to be run very poorly. We go in on occasion for the large patio and good food and would love to go more but do not get a good positive vibe like we experience other places. do like that our dog can sit on patio with us while we dine though!"}
{"text":"Temple Bar is such a great sports bar especially during football season!   We have been coming to Temple for the Penn State watch parties over the years.  This venue, with the help from Phoenix Penn State Alumni Association, gets better and better each year!  The service, the football specials and the crowd is great!  Love their food too! Recommend the gyro sandwich, wings, burgers, and entree salads.  The staff really hustles especially the manager and the bartenders.  Highly recommend this place for watching sports!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant close to my house. In what seems like a very glamorous town temple bar is a great place to just hang out and have good food. I'm sad to see that there moving down the road but still look forward to dropping by often."}
{"text":"I hate to do this as I'm always hopeful this place will pull it together but I have to admit, I've started going to the \"other\" neighborhood pub more and more. Reasons?  *Patio ALWAYS dirty and furniture stained and falling apart. Is it that hard to keep that wonderful patio space comfortable and inviting?  * They changed the menu and not in a good way.  *Apparently the gym next door took over the bags game area and so that fun is no more.  *Bathrooms also dirty and broken all the time and paper towel machine empty.  Unfortunately it seems this place is managed very poorly and/or barely hanging on financially and cannot afford to keep things fresh and presentable. Really too bad as it was a great place for awhile."}
{"text":"Wow, that was pretty awful. The steak salad was just horrendous - full of grizzle & floppy greens. My husband's gyros were mediocre. Good tater tots & service, though."}
{"text":"This place had me at cheese & bacon covered tater tots.  Needing to get the hell out of the office early yesterday, I joined a co-worker for happy hour at the Temple Bar.  It was my first time here, and I guarantee you that it will not be my last.  Great ambiance in the place, with a massive patio that comes complete with plenty of areas to sit, a beanbag toss game and even \"outdoor\" seating at the bar.  You can't beat that.  Plenty of great beers on draft, ranging from your standard macro-brews to some obscure German beers as well.  What will definitely keep me coming back (other than the cute waitresses that were there) are the happy hour specials.  Half-price on pretty much every appetizer that they have, and $3 draft beers.  We inhaled a couple orders of the sliders (which were amazing) and an order of the aforementioned cheese & bacon covered tater tots.  Solid.  I was told that the wings are damn good here as well, and other options on the menu that looked stellar that I will try next time were BBQ ribs and sauteed Cajun shrimp.  If you are in the Northern Scottsdale area and need to get out of the office for happy hour or swing by a place for an after-golf drink, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"nice outdoor patio & band playing."}
{"text":"I lived down the street from this place for almost two years before I even heard about it. I shouldn't have admitted that to you because now my credibility when it comes to knowing the \"it\" places in Scottsdale just went down the tubes. FAIL. But hey, if you are reading this review you probably haven't been there yet either so just shut up and read, ok?   Here is the dilly. I came here NYE. They had a $65 all you can drink special from 9p-2a that night. Nydia A. and I waited until the last minute to make plans and this seemed easy and pretty damn affordable, not to mention close to home. As a NYE venue I wasn't a big fan...but I do know a good (or even great) sports bar when I see one.   What it isn't: Hoppin with booty shakin music (we had to beg the DJ to play what we deemed \"dance worthy\" music), filled with beautiful people, packed to the brim with a thirty minute wait to get in, pretentious, where you should go if you are a Scottsdale DB looking to get laid.   What it is: A place to get good (strong) drinks for a reasonable price, convenient if you live within a five mile radius (they have a paddywagon free of charge), chill, and very conducive to the needs of sports enthusiasts. Oh and somewhere I can go without having to primp and wear six inch ankle breaking heels. (totally wish I got that memo BEFORE I dressed for NYE)   The bottom line: You'll probably see me there during football season proudly sporting a Tebow jersey, yelling at the flat screens, beer in one hand and hot wing in the other."}
{"text":"Temple is a great place to meet with locals and grab a beer during games. The food is reasonably priced and it's really good. The staff is friendly and not overbearing. Other then the few crazy jets fans this place is great!"}
