{"text":"Food was great, service was excellent our waitress was absolutely amazing! SO FRIENDLY! The place is really cute and neat. The bathrooms are nice as well. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Friday after work and the wife and I we're debating where to eat. We let YELP decide. Fish tacos were great and Greek salad was refreshing. Great local environment! The ambiance was modern and comfortable. Nice and cool too. Good, friendly service.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love the Philly w/jalapeños & the staff rocks!  My favorite restaurant in the 'hood."}
{"text":"After moving here from Chicago to Tatum Ranch in Cave Creek, my husband and I stopped in for dinner...so excited to have a restaurant  close ti the house that could become a staple for us as we eat out 2 to 3 times for dinner every week...well, we will not be back - drinks were subpar, service was bad, food was cold...sad really - kick it up a notch of 10 and you could print money!"}
{"text":"We frequent Brisam's all hours, all days of the week and the food is always great! Definitely recommend the philly cheese and the fish tacos. Fish fry on Friday's is a third favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice neighborhood restaurant.  We do not have many in this neck of the woods so we will take anything.  This place is good.  It is upscale and the prices are reasonable for the neighborhood.  However, the best has to be the customer service.  The server and waitress were very friendly and let you know you mattered.    They tend to get busy, which means they have a lot of repeat customers.  That should speak for itself."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and the owner Steve is usually there makingsure everyting is gotng good with your meal and you are enjoying your visit.  They take great pride in knowing folks and are always aiming to bring you back. -  tough menu choices-  Every  sounds and looks great coming out of the kitchen.  Just go!  You will love it!!"}
{"text":"I like this place... Never did eat here, but the bar is loaded with regular ol' local folks who are cool and don't have that \"stay outta my locals only bar\" attitude.... The bartenders and waitresses are very cool and they pour big pours for reasonable money.... Good quiet bar."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and are trying new restaurants.  We called to make sure they were open and saw the menu online and it looked appealing for a casual lunch. Sign said to wait to be seated and no one was around.  We looked at the condition on the uncleared tables and food laying on the floor, looked at each other and walked out.  Maybe the food would have been good but were was the staff and why was the place such a mess?  It was a real turn off."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar. Friendly service, clean, wonderful atmosphere. The fish tacos were phenomenal! I had them blackened and it was just the right amount of heat to let me know  it was there, but not enough to overwhelm the flavor of the fish. Great portion size with beans and rice on the side. If you are looking for somewhere great to unwind for a bit and grab a tasty meal in the Cave Creek area, this is a safe bet!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love stopping in at Brisam's.  Friday night's is one of my favorites as they have the best clam chowder in town, and always great special's.  Neighborhood atmosphere, with casual attire with a good mix menu.  The staff is always friendly and I can say that every visit the service has been outstanding.  I'd list all my favorites but that is list is just tooo long.  Great place to visit with friends over a good meal and drinks. Michele and Greg Clark"}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. Service was excellent and the food good.  We had an occasion to have a meeting with about 10 people outside in the patio. The service was most cordial and checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything.  The place is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. I describe it as \"upscale American with a casual vibe.\" Tables are spaced perfectly for intimate setting (I like privacy) but also, there's a friendly feel where you can talk to anyone.  I have toddlers (who can be super annoying) and a very picky/snobby father (more annoying). Brisam's handles any combination of family seamlessly. Food? You can pick something different every time and it's a good bet. Husband and I have some staples (spicy chicken, chicken piccata, basil/mozzarella salad, Tuscan pasta, etc).  Just go here, you'll be happy ;) Cindy is awesome and there's another waitress with wavy blonde hair that's great too. We're lifers and thankful we have an impressive watering hole so close."}
{"text":"My boyfriend swears that this place was awesome a few years ago. I wish I could say the same for it today. We live really close by and I so wanted this place to be awesome. After trying it on 3 separate occasions, I have just given up. The staff is always dragging around, as if you're a big bother. It seems like they're friendly to the bar patrons but, anyone else is just an irritant. The first time we ate here, they forgot my daughter's meal and when we asked about it she said \"oh, do you still want it?\". I could go on and on about a slew of mini issues that all add up to crappy. You always have to ask for more drinks, even water. They never clear your table when bringing you fresh glasses, just leaving the old ones to clutter. The food is usually kind of gross or at best, completely forgettable. I could almost put up with lame food as long as the staff is friendly, or at least kind of cordial. The cuisine is overpriced for what it is (terrible). I'm serious when I say that the Carls Junior down the street has better service, fresher food and a cheaper menu. Just my $0.02"}
{"text":"Excellent American food and very friendly staff! Delicious thin crust pizza and fish tacos. Yummy fresh spinach dip. Family friendly with a nice patio, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We live very close by and drive by Brisams literally every day to drop of our kids at school. Honestly, with the local penchant for high end, mediocre food, I always thought that Brisams was just another wannabe high end joint. From the outside, who would have thought it was basically a sports bar. I guess that's the problem I have with Brisams. It's deceiving in that it is a sports bar with typical fare, but not quite a sports bar. If this was the original intent when it was built, it misses the mark pretty severely. If it used to be a mediocre high end restaurant turned sports bar, then I suppose they get a little give on the decor. Simply put, the place doesn't fit the usual sports bar feel....something is missing.   The food was good, not great. Atmosphere was lively and plenty of folks dining, even on a Tuesday evening. Clientele seems to be older than we were with a 6 year old."}
{"text":"For a small neighborhood bar /restuarant,  this is as good as it gets.   The food is good and the service is friendly.  Patrons are friendly as well.  I usually get one of their pizzas to eat,  but have eaten numerous other things from the menu and was never disappointed.  The fish tacos have become a favorite of my girlfriend since she tried them a few weeks ago.  One drawback is that they close kind of early. (10pm)  Not a problem for me,  but it might be for others."}
{"text":"On a whim we tried Brisam's last night over Cocomo Joe's strictly based on Yelp reviews.  So glad we did.  It's got a great vibe, great staff and fantastic food.  The clam chowder is probably the best I've ever had in Phoenix.  My fiance had a spicy chicken sandwich that was top notch, I had the killer mac n cheese, and it was as advertised, killer.  Incredibly cheesey and huge portions, I had the rest of it for lunch today.    We split chicken strips as an appetizer, they were the only part of the meal that wasn't amazing, but they were still very good.    Our server was incredibly attentive (glass of water never got close to half empty and the restaurant was hopping) and friendly, and the host (also assuming the owner) dropped by the table a few times and was very personable.    We've lived less than a mile away for nearly a year, and had never even heard of Brisam's, but will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Food was good and our server was as attentive as he could be (it was exceedingly busy that night).  The hostess however left bused tables open and seated a party in front of ours (my guess is they were regulars).  It's frustrating to be waiting for a table and seeing 2 open tables yet to be seated for an unknown reason.  I'd give them another shot though"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The food is pretty good, portions are nice, the servers are pretty attentive, as are the bartenders.  The owner (maybe she is the manager?) is often there and is super nice.  My wife and I usually share a salad and some appetizers... everything we've tried so far has been good.  My only complaint is I wish they had s few more tap lines or filled the tap lines they had with some better craft beer choices.  It would be nice to have some more local options for instance in a local business like this.  Anyhow I highly recommend... best place for a pint and some good food in the area."}
{"text":"Another great meal. Had the infamous MAC and cheese.  The lady had chic Marsala. Both great. Couldn't finish as usual   So it was great for today's lunch for both of us.  Great service.  No place is perfect. But I've never been disappointed.  I haven't been in a few months.  So good"}
{"text":"With Mahi tacos that will blow ur mind! Wonderful servers and amazing drinks, don't forget to check out the creole shrimp!!!"}
{"text":"Been going there for years and I love it! The food is delicious and it's consistent. Love the creole shrimp appetizer, the garlic bread that comes with it is to die for. Love their pizza and my boyfriend loves the Philly cheesesteak. You must try it!"}
{"text":"Great service and a very good hamburger.  Restaurant was too noisy for my taste, with a lot of bar noise throughout.  Seems to be more of a drinking place than a restaurant.  Will pass next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and consistent. Neighborhood feel. Locally owned. Family friendly. Staff is always on it. They do get busy especially on weekends but it's worth it. Dry rub wings are my fav. Wife lives the burgers. Kids love chicken tenders and pizza. Great job Brisam's!  We will continue to come back and grab takeout as regulars...  AND the music is great too!"}
{"text":"love this place, super casual and delicious food, good atmosphere and good service.  they have a vodka penne pasta that is to die for...not the healthiest but there is plenty for leftovers (I've frozen them and saved them for a meal later on and it was still delicious).  Great drinks and the servers really know their stuff about the food and flavors as well as how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Great food all around! Nice place to watch a game , pop a top, and grab a bite.  The spicy chicken sandwich is tremendous , and the southwest pasta with sun dried tomatoes is really delicious. Great service and good value too. It's one of my favorites in the area ."}
{"text":"We'd seen Brisam's pop up on our Yelp listings while looking for places to eat near our home, and hadn't tried it since Lone Mountain Rd just seems so far north to us (even though it's less than 10 minutes away). A few days ago, we happened to wander up in that area for some errands and decided to finally give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is fairly unassuming on the outside but easy to find. Their menu was quite extensive, with lots of options available to choose from. My hubby ordered the Chicken Philly Sandwich and he really enjoyed it. He asked for bell peppers to be added, but didn't realize it was a jalapeno/bell pepper mix, so there was quite a bit of heat to the sandwich. Good thing we both love spicy food. :) As for myself, I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. It was very good as well, and bigger than I was anticipating. The bread tasted fresh, and was nice and soft with a good crust from the grill. The chicken breast was large and juicy, and the \"spicy\" part was a slowly building heat. We both got our sandwiches with side salads, and they were a good size portion. Service was friendly and attentive; no complaints. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and are excited to try some of their other options when we return in the future."}
{"text":"Brisam's is a great local Cave Creek restaurant & bar. We have been going here for years and it's always good food and friendly people. It's a little hidden behind Tudor Time at Lone Mountain & Cave Creek Roads. We recently tried one of the chalkboard specials - Bacon & Jalapeno wrapped shrimp over a spinach salad - Wow, it was really good. We also had a stuffed baked potato. They are always trying something new but also have a regular menu of favorites. Pizza also is great. Thanks Steve and Crew!"}
{"text":"Eat there with sis and bro In law. They got their reg booth. Burger was good but but fell apart some. Fries were good and beer cold. Philly cheese steak sandwich and pizza looked good. They were happy with their choices. If in the area next time I'm in town, I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this friendly hole in the wall place where after awhile of going everyone will know you. My wife calls it her Regal Beagle.  Great food and decent prices. If you are in the cave creek area definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"First time eating here...nothing fancy, smaller then what I expected.   What really made the  lunch experience great was Cindy our server!!!! What a personality...so accommodating and genuinely wanted us happy.  We chose a mixture  of appetizers, Cavecreek egg rolls, onion rings, Cajun shrimp, nachos, and chicken strips, everything was fine, nothing fantastic,  but , definitely edible.   I would go back to try something more on the extensive menu, and hope Cindy is working that day:)"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. Atmosphere is nice sports bar. The pizza we ordered and shared was great and a good size for two people. We had two cocktails that were heavy on alcohol, light on taste/flavor. We didn't enjoy them that much but that might be fine for most folks - it is a sports bar, after all. We really enjoyed the food though!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and server always very pleasant and friendly, without being intrusive.  Love their philly cheesesteak sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is a few minutes from our house so my boyfriend and I tend to come a lot. It has a very \"local\" feel to it which I like. Their \"Cave Creek\" salad is delicious and literally EVERY dish is MASSIVE. Do not come here unless you're starving or else you will bring half of your order home with you.   They're one of the only places that we have found that sell \"two harded ale\" ... A Michigan beer which is my bfs fav. As long as we live near by we will come and come again."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem!  Food is outstanding and service is perfect. We come here often."}
{"text":"What a fun place, great atmosphere, bar tenders are really helpful and fun to talk to. It seems like everyone there is family. Its just a really relaxed place where everyone knows each other.  The food is just great and big portions."}
{"text":"Amazing food, especially the cheesesteak ! Haven't ever been disappointed ever. The service is great and the staff is awesome. If you haven't been before I would encourage anyone to give them a try and you'll know why I gave it five stars"}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying that I don't usually write poor reviews. We dined at Brishams last night and brought friends that had not been there before. It was Friday and a full house-good for them for being busy! We had a party of 4 and waited 30+ minutes to be seated. I'm okay with waiting-my concern is that there was a corner booth open the entire time. After about waiting 20 minutes we inquired if we could be seated at the open booth and were advised that is was for parties of 5 or greater. The booth could sit up to 5-6 people comfortably. The opposing corner had the same both with only 4 people seated in it. I pointed that out to the hostess, she advised us that those patrons were friends of the owners, so it was approved by him. That's just a huge turn off- the open table was not reserved-yet we couldn't be seated. Would Brishams rather seat their customers in a timely manner at a open table and take over a $100 order or have them leave? From my experience and observations, they would rather them leave. I wanted to leave, the others decided we would wait a little longer to see if a table opened up. We finally got seated and enjoyed dinner with friends but this really left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. The food and remainder of our service was good.  ***PS- that corner booth sat empty all night! I think a policy change is in order."}
{"text":"Place is a little cramped, but the food is above what most bars serve very tasty. Servers are nice and even when packed the beer and food come quick"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Sunday. Very quiet until all their regulars showed up. Bar food, but good bar food. The buffalo shrimp are worth going for - yum!! Bartender was very personable. Great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Brisam's is a great place for lunch. Whenever I'm craving the best Philly cheese steak sandwich in town this is where you will find me. I always order my Philly cheese steak with chopped jalapeños and a side of fries."}
{"text":"For the past 10 years this has been my \"go to\" for the best food and drink in Cave Creek, great staff, wonderful ownership and truly my \"home away from home\". From the pasta's to pizza to steak and seafood this restaurant is and always has been at the top of my list !   Love you Brisams !"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's good for a beer and something to eat, watch the game. Wait staff is always top notch. Only thing I would change is the local women. If you are young and mildly attractive, they look at you like you shouldn't be there. Cold as ice! Brrrr!"}
{"text":"Brisam's has excellent food and outstanding service! We've been here several times and the service is consistently awesome! I would recommend everything I've tried so far..fish tacos, Alfredo, burgers, taco salad, baked potato, soup, the list goes on. Whatever you get, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything was good except the loud hard rock music playing, probably  good for the bar patrons but in your face while trying to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Love the bar. Ask for Kevin. He's a hoot. Oh, the beer is always ice cold."}
{"text":"This is a terrific neighborhood restaurant bar where you immediately feel welcome by the staff and the 'regulars'. The philly steak sandwich is incredibly yummy, reasonably priced at under 10 bucks for a very generous portion and the bartendars are quite generous with their pour's. Very casual and a great place to hang out at the end of a long day. I wish they were open later but glad they have such a wonderful staff and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here a lot during lunch time.  The food is great and the service from the wait staff is excellent.  Their southwest salad and nachos are really good and I strongly recommend them."}
{"text":"I recently went here to check out their lunch offerings. According to their website, this place looks fun! A Bar, Grill, Patio, and Restaurant.  Well, it's really just a bar. The eating area is dark (and not the good romantic kind) and the four of us needed our phone flashlights to see the menu...for LUNCH. There is no \"patio\" set up that we could see and most food didn't appear to be offered \"grilled\" - mostly fried. I ordered a baked potato (plain) with a caesar salad and my potato came loaded with cheese, bacon, and sour cream. I ordered the caesar without croutons (gluten free) and it came with them on. Two people ordered a spicy chicken gumbo soup and only one of them had any chicken in it. We were all disappointed. Also, it began to rain as we were leaving and the rain was coming down the inside of the windows. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I was here years ago and it wasn't memorable.  Unfortunately, it's still not terribly memorable.  There's not specifically bad per se but it's just okay."}
{"text":"It's been quite a few years, maybe even several, since I've been here. I remember liking, but not as much as I enjoyed it last night.   Unfortunately they don't take reservations for a party of 5, but many places don't. We hit timing right on the jackpot though. As we walked in, a large booth opened up and we were seated right away.   Our server, I believe her name was Taylor, was on top of her game. She was quick to get our drinks, prompt to take and deliver our orders, had great recommendations, was funny and polite and just took great care of us.   The food was good too. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and said they would be happy to come back. My husband and I both ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which were not super spicy, but had a small kick. I loved that they had a 7 grain bun. So many places only have one option. My mom and grandma thoroughly enjoyed their Creole Shrimp with garlic bread, I can vouch that I was delicious and my stepdad liked his chicken fingers. We also ordered the southwestern eggrolls. These aren't my favorite anywhere, but they did have a nice flavor and had just a skosh of heat.  When we went to leave the owner held the door for us and seemed grateful for his customers.  Overall, if you are looking for good food, service and prices, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was very busy for a Tuesday night in the summer, which is a great sign. Our waitress treated us like FAMILY (in a good way). The Malbec on the list was spectacular for the price. We ordered hamburgers and they were large and delicious. they came with abundant side salads.  We had to eat inside due to the heat, but their patio looked nice. Its in a small strip mall so the outdoor ambiance isn't that great, but this was not important to us. This was perfect for a local place to go when you just don't want to cook at home. There were plenty of TV's for watching sports and there seemed to be a chunk of families there.   We eat out a lot and this experience over-delivered for a neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy moly Philly cheesesteak!! I have never felt so excited and happy to be at a restaurant. Cindy was one of the best servers I've had. First time here and definitely won't be my last!!"}
{"text":"What a nice little neighborhood restaurant. Clean and modern decor, but very casual. All employees were welcoming and helpful. I had the pasta and my partner had pizza; both were excellent. Good beer selection.  Great place for when you just don't feel like cooking or family is in town"}
{"text":"Lots of regulars here. Can make it difficult to find a seat a the bar, but the high tops near the bar area keep you in the loop too. They are very generous with their with their pours so watch out if you order a drink. My boyfriend always gets a steak or hamburger here and has never had a complaint. I love the tuscan chicken pasta dish with sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes. Yum! We always ask for Jen's section. She a cute sassy blonde who knows her stuff."}
{"text":"Great crust in the pizza , the wings were amazing in taste and huge compared to other places. The service was amazing, our server had refills for us before we needed it, they were very speedy. I usually don't trust my husband's food taste, he eats anything but he was right they are amazing. Gray job , cant wait to bring the kids ."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with the hubs and friends last night and had a great time! The service was exceptional and the food was good! We will be back for sure! The owner is very attentive and nice too."}
{"text":"Love Brisams ! Smaller Neighborhood Restaurant with excellent food & Service! Cindy is a server who I highly recommend &  Isaac is the bar tender who is awesome! What's better than the food being great and the staff being excellent !"}
{"text":"Meh! This place was very busy for some reason & we didn't enjoy the food. Fish & Chips are much better at Black Mountain Distillery down the road. My salad was very mediocre but had good salad dressing! Fish tacos were okay but not really what I would call good. We won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!! Love the food.I have tried most everything on their menu.  My favorite is the Chicken Philly. Their pizza's are good as are their burgers. The staff is like family and they pour a great drink. I always recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Tried this place (twice) because it is close to us but the convenience of it is not worth it. The first time we went in we were a little creeped out by the darkness of it and that it was desolate. My husband tried the Mac and cheese and I had the spicy chicken sandwich. Both were bland and unimpressive. The fries were limp and tasteless. We decided to give it a second try because we really wanted it to work. The second time the atmosphere was a bit more lively. The food was no different - bland. My husband gave the Mac and cheese another try, I had the fried chicken, and the kiddos had corn dog bites. My chicken was rock hard, the skin was a strange brown/burnt color and there was also very little meat inside. Needless to say, we will not be back and if we ever come back it will be with great trepidation."}
{"text":"Love their food, definitely hits the spot!!! I recommend the whiskey penne pasta or killer Mac 'n cheese -- and for dessert, the Kahlua ice cream mud pie."}
{"text":"This place offers a really fantastic Sunday afternoon and evening football experience if you want to be surrounded by a variety of fans without any overly aggressive nonsense.  Cindy is amazing, the food and drink is solid and it is just generally a fun, happy place.   I do have to say that if you are a Seahawks fan you will get a healthier pour :-).  Plenty of tvs and they try to cater to all fans which is great! Oh and have to say again how great Cindy is!"}
{"text":"Fist I would like to say that the service was great. The food was though was mediocre at best. I ordered the fish fry. When my plate arrived it looked good, until I tried to cut the fish. It was heavily battered and the fish was rubbery and hard to chew. Cod in my opinion should be flakey. The coleslaw lacked flavor and was dry. The fries were ok. If it wasn't for the nice friendly server, I would give it one star."}
{"text":"Service and staff are great but the food is just average. Restaurant was a little dirty and needs some deep cleaning."}
{"text":"I've had their eggrolls and they are the best I've ever eaten. I also really enjoyed their buffalo wings. They mix a good drink, have friendly and cute waitresses. The food there is fabulous the Decor is just average but boy do they have great food."}
{"text":"Coming from the Chicago area we were looking for a local restaurant for pizza. So far it's the best pizza in the area. Brisams offers a good menu at fair prices and excellent service. Only downside it's too dark. Needs slightly better ambiance and more inviting entry. This us our local go to restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is my family's favorite go to restaurant. Service is always fantastic and super friendly, and the food never disappoints. Some favorites are the blackened chicken Alfredo, fish tacos, and any of the pizzas! There isn't a better neighborhood restaurant as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"I live very close to here so wanted to check it out.  It's tucked back behind another building so not visible from street.... their sign does the trick though.  Ok so hubby had the spicy chicken sandwich and I had the fried chicken.  All was just okay... nothing exciting.  Sandwich was pretty spicy and good but nothing outstanding.  Chicken was crispy and batter was thick and heavy but not a ton of flavor.  Coleslaw came with chicken and was also lacking flavor.  I'm a french fry lover... I'd pass on these and get something else.  They were thin fries that just were mediocre if that.  The service was pretty good but very friendly.  I will agree with other yelpers that their pours are very generous! I wasn't crazy about the food but I will definitely give them one more try at least."}
{"text":"I absolutely Loooove coming to Brisam's for lunch.        The Mahi tacos are my favorite thing off of the menu and if you haven't tried them yet you need to get in here ASAP and give them a try.       If the owner Steve is in on the day you choose to delight your taste buds with his amazing dishes than you are in for another awesome treat!!! Steve was so nice, greeted us, went over the menu with us, and made sure we were okay our entire visit here.        Bottom line is, if you haven't tried out Brisam's yet, add it to your list!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Brisams several times now. We always have good service. Sometimes the place is packed & it takes a little longer, but the wait staff is always very attentive and the food is good. It's great having a restaurant close by."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Brisam's regularly for years with very consistent results. I like consistency when it comes to food quality and service - especially if they are in my neighborhood. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's easy to take Brisam's for granted sometimes. Not sure why, since the restaurant pickins are slim in this general area of Cave Creek/Tatum Ranch.... so we are lucky to have Brisam's!  We have probably eaten here 50 times in the past 5+ years - so perhaps once a month or so. I don't recall even a single time where our order was wrong, slow, or the food less than very good. The service is always very fast and great for weeknights when we don't want to cook but need decent food and a glass of wine and just go home. Our kids (6 and 9) really like the place too, and the staff is always very friendly with them and I appreciate that.  As other reviewers mentioned, it's sort of a cross between a sports bar and a \"normal\" midrange restaurant. Pretty contemporary furnishings and low lighting in the evening. If you want a good meal and fast, consistent service, you can't really go wrong with Brisam's!  Rating it 5 stars because it delivers on good food at an appropriate price point for it's class - with consistently good service!"}
{"text":"We had drove past this for years, and one of my neighbors told me is was really good.  We went the other day and the food was really good, service was OK.  I would recommend going in."}
{"text":"Brisam's is your perfect neighborhood restaurant/bar where everyone knows your name. The food is good and the service is exceptional. I've met so many nice people there. Jen, Denay, and staff treat all people like friends and family. Steve, the owner comes up and asks if he can get you anything else and if your meal is the way that you wanted it. Even my mom didn't do that. At first I felt that they were going out of there way for me, but soon realized that that was how they treat everyone there. Patrons are very relaxed and easy going, so it's not hard to strike up a friendly conversation with almost anyone. There prices are extremely reasonable and as I stated, the service is exceptional. I highly recommend Brisam's to anyone that is looking for a relaxing environment with good food, great service, and a relaxing environment that is family friendly."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT  Commercial space sports bar with lots of TVs and a large bar at the end of the room with better hi-res TVS.  Great service! Our waitress helped us pick the best food and drinks.   MENU  HUGE PORTIONS. Apps, soups and salad, pizzas, sandwiches entrees kids options, descent beer selection and sides.   APPS Creole Shrimp -- So good. The best of the shrimp options on the menu. Comes with amazing toast that you dip in the broth.   Chicken Wings -- Ordered hot with extreme on the side.   ENTREE Mac 'n Cheese -- order if you're hungry. Loaded with tons of cheese."}
{"text":"Perfect little bar and grill. After traveling around Phoenix and Flagstaff for several days we settled into the Boulders Resort nearby and came here for dinner. The place was clean, the service was great and by the time we left there were no tables left.  The food is typical bar and grill fare but with a twist. The Mac and cheese was great and so were the chicken strips (according to the kids). They had a good beer and wine selection to choose from too.  Bottom line is that the food was good, the staff was great and the place was hoping. We had a good time!"}
{"text":"So yummy. Our favorite 1 x a week dinner place. Wish it was more but we eat at home a lot. Always great service. Always great food."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I were looking for a place we hadn't been before and after some extensive searching we found Brisam's. Let me say we could not have chosen better. The food was fantastic - you have to try the dry rub (blackened) chicken wings. They are literally the best wings we've ever had. I had the philly cheese steak and my wife had the spicy chicken sandwich; both were outstanding! Cindy was our server and she was phenomenal! She gave us great suggestions and truly made our evening wonderful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband got the Mac n Cheese (as its known for)... But the cheese was really bland. Unfortunately he said even the \"yellow stuff out of the box\" was better.  I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and they were just ok. The kids chicken looked like pressed, formed, unnatural pieces. Overall we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Neighborhood sure thing!!!  Very accommodating!!!  Always a \"YES, we can do that!!\"  Friendliest staff!!!  Cindy is the BEST!!!  They make you feel like they really WANT and APPRECIATE your business!!!!  Food is always served hot and exactly the way we ordered it!!"}
{"text":"Not bad! was very slow for a Saturday but the food came quick and prices were competetive with everyone else."}
{"text":"Haven't found an item in the menu yet that isn't just plain good, whether you want an appy or a full meal, this place has it all.  Great service and prices too."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. Fast service. Place has survived many years at this location and parking lot is always busy. They must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I had to ask the waitress if she owned the place because she was so attentive and caring. She really understood how important service is. She recommended dishes and helped my associate and I choose. And it was spot on. The burger was fantastic and the Philly cheese steak was really good. We started with the spicy spinach dip, which was better than most Mexican places I have been too. The free wi-fi and power sockets will make this a regular for my workday lunches.   Over all a great place to grab lunch or an after work drink. They have tv's so good for games.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Had to food here a few times and was not disappointed! Great local watering hole!"}
{"text":"Rude hostess. Came in at 5pm with 2 small kids asking for a booth. Refused to sit me in a larger booth of which there were 2 open. Only offered us a table in middle of restaurant. Clearly wouldn't work with children. If you only take walk-ins shouldn't I be able to sit anywhere? Horrible. She wasn't even close to polite about it."}
{"text":"When we first went I was not impressed, but I have become a fan. The food is great, the servers are awesome! A favorite Friday night hangout."}
{"text":"Cindy is amazing. You want exceptional service, can me to Brisams! The food is great! Always  searching for the best thing ranch?!? Stop you've found it! Philly cheese steak is awesome. I cant wait to come back and try their Reuben!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great people. Great atmosphere. Popular Local spot. The pretzel app is great, when on daily special board.  Happy hour 3-6 and the Southwest Eggrolls are delicious."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good stuff--  The ballpark pretzel with spinach dip-- so good. It was on the specials board, so not sure how often it's served. The servings were very generous. Our table had the philly sandwich, loaded baked potato, and the killer Mac n cheese. No complaints here, but nothing crazy good. Definitely a spot for locals. The serving staff knew some patrons by first name, gave hugs at the door, etc; great vibe. Our server (I missed her name) was fabulous. Prompt, accurate, and attentive.   For the not so good-- The hostess was a bit scatter brained. She forgot menus, made seating tough for my dad with a walker, and didn't seem to be enjoying her job. When we finally asked for menus, she delivered them to the table that had just been seated before us, who had been waiting. An order that wasn't ours was brought to our table by the busser. Nothing huge, but just little things that are noticeable as a patron.   The food was nothing to rave about, but good. Front of the house staff just ok, but table service was great.   I do want to note that we went the day after Christmas. After time off, it could take the staff a day to get back in their groove. Just giving them benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Well, I wish I could write a review about the food, drinks, anything, however...we walked in last Friday night close to 7:45pm.    We were told there was one party ahead of us who we could see standing inside the restaurant waiting.  We moved out of the way and sat outside the front door.  My boyfriend took a peek outside on the side patio to see if there was any seating there and he told me it was a smoke fest out there and no way would we want to sit outside and be forced to inhale cigarette smoke at dinner.  The people in front of us were seated at an open table. Then another party of 2 walked in behind us and gave their name.  Then a party of 7 people walked in and were offered a large corner booth which I had no issue with since it would be silly to sit us there with only 2 of us.  We are reasonable people.  Then the people said, well you could put some of us at the large table and put some others at another table.  I thought, no that's not fair, they had a table and it was plenty big.    Then the next thing we see are the 2 people who came in after us walking to a table.  We walked inside for 2 reasons.  One, there was a patron standing right outside the front door who lit up a cigarette and started smoking right at the front door.  Second we wanted to ask the hostess why we weren't seated first.  They did not go outside, they were seated inside.  She darted away from us and there was an older man in a red shirt who worked there and could clearly see we were not pleased and he looked at the floor and would not look either of us in the eye.  We had an issue with that.  We looked at each other and said, you know, there are too many good restaurants in Cave Creek and as a new customer, we don't deserve to be mis-treated even before we could be seated.  We figured this was the beginning of a bad experience at a new place and felt it was going to get worse before it got better.   For those of you who have never been here, it's loud inside, crazy loud.  I got a bad vibe about cleanliness and frankly had no issue leaving this place and will never, ever go back!  We drove to El Encanto up in Cave Creek for some Mexican food, grabbed a drink at the bar, were seated at a beautiful table outside all within 10 minutes of arriving there and they were BUSY!  We had a fantastic evening and I'm glad we blew off Brisams like they blew us off."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about Brisam's is that it is air-conditioned.  No, that was rude.  Actually, the service was pretty good.  It's pretty beat-up inside and we were seated at a table that had been wiped down but still had crumbs on the table-top and seat.  The tables are VERY close together.  It was about 5 pm and Happy Hour was in full-swing.  Almost every table was seated and the acoustics not so great, so even though DH and I sat catty-corner to one another, it was hard to hear each other.  It didn't help that a person of the female persuasion in the bar area was very happy, and for our entire meal made conversation or whinnied laughter at ear-splitting noise level.    The good thing, is that the average age of the clientele in the dining room made DH and I feel young and frisky!  I ordered the fish tacos with a dinner salad.  DH ordered the honey chicken sandwich.  DH got a glass of wine, I got ice tea.  My ice tea tasted like a hint of old pipes, but it was cold and came with a big ol' lemon wedge, and was okay once you got used to the weird flavor.  It would have been nice if server had refilled my glass once, because odd flavor or not, it was really hot and the afternoon sun beats on the front plate glass windows, making it a bit warm in the restaurant, even with the ac at top speed.  DH was happy with his wine---served at proper temp, the glass was clean, price acceptable.  Our salads were not very interesting and they were a weird combo of old and icky and new and crisp.  Half my salad was that big, yucky bitter yellow heart that should be tossed.  The other half was fresh green leaves and then those slimy dark green bits that come from a salad left in a bag or bin too long.  DH's was the same, excepting he didn't have as much lettuce heart in his.  Our salad dressings were good and the amount provided generous.  My fish tacos arrived accompanied by a bowl of black beans and \"mexican\" rice.  I could tell the black beans would have been really tasty if they hadn't been so over-salted I choked on my one and only bite.  DH tried a bite (he loves black beans) and his comment was; \"J***s!\" The rice was not memorable.  The fish tacos were so overcooked---there was nothing succulent or delicious about them, except the blackening seasoning was quite good.  DH said his sandwich was very tasty as far as seasoning and sauces go, but the chicken was overcooked, and this is a man who likes his meat cooked to the point of shoe leather.  He said the bun was very good.  DH's comment as we left was: \"Hey, the food arrived hot\".  And that is a positive point.    It was not an expensive meal.  I think if we want a quick, casual meal and we are in the area, why wouldn't we just drive the extra five minutes and go to Heart & Soul?  But if I was really, really hungry and for some reason not willing to drive up Cave Creek Road a piece, I'd try Brisam's again, because if you aren't concerned about noise-level or flavor, it does provide a goodly amount of food and acceptable pricing with decent service."}
{"text":"This local restaurant really needs a decor update..dark, dank, smelled of fish and stale beer. Food was only so so..burger was VERY overcooked despite ordering it medium. The French fries were tasteless and greasy. Very slow to get drink refills. Will likely not return, would rather eat at home."}
{"text":"We went here because my companion lives in Cave Creek, and I thought we'd try it.   The restaurant and decor reminds me of a small-town kind of place, you know, kind of \"homey.\"  Paige was our server.   I asked her if the bartender could make a french martini.   (Not all places have the ingredients.)   She asked him, and said he could.   Perfecto!   We asked for suggestions as to what was good.   She gave her opinion and we selected the whiskey penne pasta blackened and jambalaya blackened.    YUMMMMM!!   Both were cooked and flavored just the way we liked it with the right mix of ingredients.   We saw a gentleman going from table to table greeting and talking with his guests.    I asked Paige if he was the owner.   Yes, was the response.   When he stopped by our table, I told him  how great the food was.  He sat down and we talked at length.    A very, very friendly person, just what one would expect in a small-town kind of place.   Paige is very efficient and friendly, and we enjoyed having her as our server.   Would I go back?    Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"Went specifically to try their cheesesteak. Definitely tasty and worth a try.  Our server Cindy was awesome. We will definitely be back to this local neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"We got our first takeout tonight.   Pizza for my husband and grilled chicken club salad for me.     First - the food was ready to go in 15 min - had to leave right after ordering.   I was a bit worried that this would mean it was not fresh.  WRONG.   Salad was huge - and very fresh.   The chicken was even warm.   The pizza was terrific as well.    Cannot comment on how it is to dine in but we will be trying it out!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim to grab a quick appetizer and glass of wine. The egg rolls and loaded fries are amazing! Friendly staff and cool atmosphere. I definitely recommend you stop in."}
{"text":"We thought this was a new restaurant and decided to check it out.  Turns out they have been here for  5 years just didn't have a street sign.  Food and service were great.  The Cajun shrimp app was to die for.  The Tuscan pasta and the fish tacos soooo worth another trip."}
{"text":"Mehhhh!! The food was mediocre, the drinks were terrible, and the service was the only good part. Would not go back :("}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. They have awesome pizza which is very reasonably priced and other food items that are equally tasty. It is low key and the locals are mostly families."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant.  While salmon is not on their regular menu it is frequently part of the daily specials.  My family makes fun of me because I often call and ask if salmon is part of the specials.  Yes I'm a salmon stalker....lol.  Well tonight when I called it was winner winner salmon dinner.  It's always consistent and very tasty.  As for the service staff.... the waitresses are extremely friendly, never write you order down and always get it right!!  I will be back again when salmon is one of the daily specials."}
{"text":"We love Brisam's!!!  It is close to where we live so we could almost walk.  The food is so good and the service is awesome!! You may have to wait sometimes but it is well worth it!  They make a great vodka tonic and the spinich artichoke dip is one of my favorite appetizers!  You can't do much better if you want great food and great service and a nice atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Brisam's several times, but I have taken this place for granted and never written a review.    This is a very casual place.  It's kind of a Sports Bar but with better dining.  We have enjoyed many of their sandwiches which are available on a wide variety of buns.  The fish and chips is good, but not awe inspiring.  Last Saturday, I ordered the fried chicken.  Our server was extremely helpful and alerted me that many people like it but it had a heavy batter.  This is how I like fried chicken and it did not disappoint me.  Our service has always been top notch.  This is a smaller place and does get busy so sometimes you need to be patient.  In the summer, it's usually not too bad.  One server ( I think her name is Cindy.) is especially fun.  She takes no notes -- even when we have been with eight people -- and we have never had a mistake in the order.  When the owner is present, he will stop by and ask if all in OK.  It's a great place to visit again, and again."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend, stopped in for a late dinner. Walked in and we're greeted immediately with a smile. Awesome friendly service, very knowledgeable about the menu. Would definitely recommend this place to friends! Also, our servers name was Cindy."}
{"text":"This is a classic date night restaurant. This is me and my guys go to restaurant because whatever we're feeling they definitely have it! Large menu, and the food always comes out extra tasty!! Service is hit or miss but will always be coming back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to think of Brisam's at first. It definitely has a local Cave Creek kind of vibe, laidback and possibly a little hole in the wall.   I'm glad we went. The food was really good! I got the mahi tacos and my boyfriend ordered the sausage garlic pizza, substituting sundried tomatoes for mushrooms. We really enjoyed both, but the best part was the appetizer - Cajun shrimp in a spicy oil. Just excellent. Its probably a good thing, but I wish they had included more bread to dip into the oil :)  The only complaint was that it seemed a little cramped inside (we sat on the patio instead) and their happy hour prices weren't anything outstanding. If I remember, it was $1 off drinks. Overall very pleasant though, and the service was above par. It seemed like our waitress cared about the restaurant and her customers a lot, which is always nice to see."}
{"text":"New owner has vastly improved this business, the food is better, but the service remains very average.  A good place to sit at the h bar and watch a football game."}
{"text":"Decent food. Burger had zero flavor and came out well done vs the requested medium. Spicy Chicken Sand was good. This place needs to change its website as the photos do not match the product, not sure why they serve Kraft mac n' cheese when the website claims that Mac N' Cheese is a specialty. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been out of the area for the past couple of years, and I'm sorry to report after three visits over the last year that Brisam's has gone downhill. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where they lost their way, but somehow the blah interior and mediocre food now seem sub-par instead of \"just right\" for a neighborhood hole-in-the-wall. There is little else in the immediate vicinity, so if you can't tolerate driving even a few minutes away, it's a reasonable choice. Otherwise if you're looking for a small local restaurant I'd head east on Lone Mountain Road to Uncle Louie's (SE corner of LM & Scottsdale Rd). Or, there's always Cave Creek proper (north) or Desert Ridge (south). In the Desert Ridge area I'd suggest Humble Pie if you're looking for a local place with a similar vibe as the Brisam's of yore.  Original review: Brisam's is an unpretentious neighborhood restaurant that delivers consistently on all the things that matter. The food is very good, the service is friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere is comfortable. This is the kind of place where you will find locals returning every week. If you're looking for something healthy and not too heavy, the fish special is always a good bet. The accompanying rice is very tasty, and the vegetables (often asparagus) are well prepared. Other good choices include the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich (surely the best in town) and the Greek salad (which features huge chunks of feta cheese)."}
{"text":"Little neighborhood place with great food and even better service. Can't go wrong here. Best Long Island ice tea in town. Meals served hot and fresh even at the busiest times you are never waiting long."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. Cindy, the server, is quick and efficient. The clam chowder and the fish tacos were exceptional. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Not bad if you get the right waitress.  It's usually a tossup.  Unfortunately they only have one good one and she is not always there.  This time she wasn't.    We were stuck with one who waits on the people who showed up after us and serves their food first.  That pissed us off a little.  When she forgot half of the things we asked for, we got a little more pissed.  When she brought my date's dinner first and mine 20 minutes later, we were ready to strangle her.  When we had to stand up to ask for a check, we said \"let's try another restaurant next time\".  As a followup, the food is good, however, it's very apparent that the staff needs better training."}
{"text":"We went here in the early evening and there was no wait. It seemed like a place that has its regular customers. The waitress was very friendly and recommended food for us. I got a Hawaiian pizza that was very good!! My husband had a burger.  Prices were good and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Such bad service that we walked out  From the reviews, you would think that the service is wonderful.  On the contrary, if tonight is any indication of their service, skip this restaurant.  OK, so we arrived during the NFL wild card game between the Ravens and the Steelers.  Brisams was quite busy, but we decided to wait.  Others came in after us, and they, too, waited in spite of the expected rather long wait.  After about twenty minutes, a table and a booth became available almost simultaneously.  We were seated at the booth, and the other group who came in about ten minutes after us, were seated at the table adjacent to the booth.  First problem, the bus person, who was also seating people, apparently wiped down the booth with a dirty rag.  The smell was horrible.  We hoped that in a few minutes the smell would dissipate.  It didn't.  Next, the waitress came over to the table and took their drink order, arrived with their drinks in about five minutes, then came to our booth and took our drink order.  I told her that we were here before them and she apologized.  Quite frankly, I find this very annoying when a group that comes in several minutes after you are served first.  Meanwhile, we waited another ten minutes and still no drinks.  Just a horrible smell from a dirty rag.  We got up and left."}
{"text":"Great little pub food joint we look forward to trying again. First time was happy with the food and service.   First we tried the pretzel w/ spinach dip which has a slight spice to it. Popping hot and yummy.    For entree's we both had burgers. I had cheeseburger with American cheese and fries and side of ranch.  The fries were crispy and perfectly fried. Buns on the burgers were super soft.  The other one was a blackened burger which has blue cheese on it. It was also cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  They are big so be prepared to take half home.  We will definitely return to try other items on their menu.  Give it shot to see if it hits your palette."}
{"text":"Service is great.  Decor is modern and sober. Food is very good.  Tried the fish tacos and Swai Filet.  Both were delicious. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"The service here is definitely the selling point.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The food was a solid okay and the beer selection was above average.  I really liked the outdoor seating area though it was constantly polluted by cigarette smoke which makes it uncomfortable for nonsmokers to enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather.  I am sure I will be back, but I'll remember my gas mask."}
{"text":"Great meal on a Thursday night (7:30 pm). Roasted garlic tomato soup was really, really good! Both got the loaded baked potato (a change of pace for both of us.) Very good. Server was attentive and pleasant, hostess friendly. Good vibe here, we'll return!"}
{"text":"After living in Cave Creek for 12 years, I'm finally a convert to Brisam's!  We went for lunch a few weeks ago, and sat on the patio.  Our server, can't remember her name, but she was the bouncy brunette who was AMAZING.  We ordered wings for an appetizer and she suggested we try their dry-rub version.  We were skeptical, but she offered to send the order as half and half, and if we didn't like it, she'd send the other half back out as buffalo.  So, no risk, really.    And, we ended up LOVING the dry rub wings.  Holy moly - totally yummy.  We're totally in.  Just great service, decent food, and a really nice experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Scottsdale area and checked yelp for nearby restaurants for lunch.  Brisam's got high marks and we were not disappointed.  It was too windy to sit outside on the lovely patio but the inside was clean and cozy (it was a bit cool outside).  The service (waitress was Cindy) was spectacular.  She was very friendly, made us feel like we were family, was very attentive to drink refills, even bringing us a separate glass of ice for our tea refills.  The food was equally spectacular.  We both had salads, the Southwestern and the Chicken Club, and they were delicious!  Too much for one serving though, so we got dinner as well."}
{"text":"I love the philly there it is in the best in town and the spinach dip is delicious and the prices are fair"}
{"text":"We met a large group there for happy hour and they really took great care of us! They cleared out a section with several tables and booths and rally took great care of everyone. No one waited very long for a drink or food. Every table taste tested something different. Each one was excellent! The Cesar salad was huge! Everyone had a great time. The patio looked like a fun place to have a meal and watch the sunset too. I live nearby and will be back with my family."}
{"text":"Sometimes  the success of a restaurant  has less to do with the food and more to do with the atmosphere. Food was good, reliable, nothing spectacular.  Enjoyable thin crust pizza, very ordinary spinach dip - but what a great vibe. Exceptional, pleasant service, owner walks around greeting patrons, you can tell there are mostly regulars at the table. My partner loved the beer selection. You will not go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar in Phoenix. Great selection of beers. Delicious food. Friendly and efficient waitresses. The best!"}
{"text":"Great food, great bartenders, just an awesome neighborhood place to hang out and watch the game."}
{"text":"Woah. So disappointed. Food delivered after an extremely long wait, cold as ice, so when I mentioned this to waitress (not our usual one), she snatched my plate without a word (i.e. Oh, I'm sorry. Let me heat that up for you.). After a while she returned my plate and it was slightly warmer. Got to the fish taco and it contained one tiny piece of fish about the size of two golf pencils side by side. Wasn't very good, like the old days (last year)."}
{"text":"Moved to a new area and were having some things done to the house and we need to kill an hour or two for lunch. Needless to say we found this by accident(because it was close) and figured it must be good as it was not easily visible from any main streets.  We were not dis appointed!! The staff was friendly, gave us the history of the place as they had been there for like 8 years! If you looking for a Great casual restaurant with a good variety on the menu, this is it!   PS - we YELP'ed it before we walked in and the good reviews were accurate!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! Best employees ! Best food. It's always a pleasant time here. Take out is always easy and quick. Prices are reasonable and their cheesesteaks are awesome!  Best tomato salad in the valley as well. Also most people would never even look but their mud pie desert is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have never eaten / been inside but from the outside it looks somewhat small. I've gotten the spaghetti there and the chicken. Both were amazing and had no regrets. The portion sizes are very good and not too big but not too small. I would definitely go back here and eat inside of the normal take out meals I have gotten."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to go do dinner away from those bustling shopping centers close to our home, like Desert Ridge. I searched Yelp for Cave Creek restaurants and Brisam's fit the bill. The food was outstanding. My husband got the fish and chips; I got the fish tacos. I was trying to eat light in preparation for dessert. We did share the deep fried cookie dough which I have to say, wasn't all that spectacular. I will pass on it next time. Our waitress was very sweet and I appreciated that the owner stopped at our table to check on us.   Our only issue was that the service wasn't great. I kept telling myself that it was busy and our waitress had a lot of tables, but that really wasn't the case. I also noticed other patrons repeatedly asking the waitress about the status of their orders. We live 7 miles from Brisam's but by the time we got home, we'd been away nearly 2 hours and that was the only place we went. That being said, I will go back and give them another shot because the food made it worth the wait."}
{"text":"If the amazing soup is any indication of a wonderful meal, we'll be back.  Ask for Cindy.  She is exceedingly friendly and made wonderful suggestions."}
{"text":"Excellent service and atmosphere. Great for sports lovers as there are plenty of TVs. Kids love the pizza. Nachos and spicy chicken sandwich are top picks!"}
{"text":"Live in area and my wife and I wanted to try a new place. Found Brisam's tucked away not super visible on a Friday night at 7:10pm.  It was super busy people waiting and tables crammed with larger groups. They sat us within 10 minutes. Our waitress Cindy was super friendly, high energy, didn't write anything down and gets it right. Had Nachos with Blackened chicken, wow best Nachos I have had in a long time. Wife had fish tacos, Mahi Mahi, they were also very good. What a great experience and we will be back. Need to check this place out, great service, great food, nice people."}
{"text":"This place is close to our house, so we thought we'd give it a try. WOW?! What great service and great food. Everything was awesome! It has a very local cozy kind of feel.....which we loved. We will absolutely go back again soon."}
{"text":"First off I just wanted to note how picky I am at restaurants. Every restaurant seems to fall short of my expectations, but Brisam.s far exceeding it.   The waitress, Cindy, was an absolute doll. She was great all around, making sure we knew how their menu worked (since it was our firat time there); made excellent recomendations; and was extremely prompt in everything that she did.  Not to mention the manager came by twice to not only make sure we enjoyed our time, but to make sure we felt at home. He communicated that he likes to learn everyones name, so your not a stranger but a friend when you eat there. This restaurant is beyond amazing. Their food was also excellent! Needless to say we will be back whether its fir drinks, food, or a friendly smile!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Love that it isn't too loud here even thought it's a sports bar. Ny husband had blackened burger w salad and i had fish and chips. Yummy. Completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Brisam's. It is an 'at home' feel, where the waitresses know your order before you sit down! Everyone is super friendly and accommodating. HOWEVER, be prepared for longer waits on ORDERING food. Sometimes we eat our appetizer and finish our drinks and are so full before we even get a chance to order our entrees because they are so backed up. But we will box up and take home for lunch the next day, we don't mind. It took us a little bit to realize this, but love the place so much that we will always go back. We frequently get take out too- make sure you get everything in your order, we have come home with wrong items before. They are busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, wanted to grab a quick bite and some drinks. We had Cindy as a server, hands down best service I've ever had! She was super busy running around like crazy and didn't miss a beat. She was amazing, fast service, very accommodating, great personality! Honestly giving this place 5 stars ok service alone. Food and drinks were great as well but the service rocked!!  Also Mac and cheese sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I love the boneless buffalo chicken wings. Wait staff is fast and friendly. The only reason I did 4 stars is because the place is getting a bit dirty and run down. It needs a new coat of paint and some dry wall patching. There are a lot of dirty hand prints around the bathroom walls and where the staff enters orders into the computers. So I hope the kitchen (which we can't see) is cleaner than the dining area...."}
{"text":"I love this place! I don't know why people go to other places. Service is wonderful and  Cindy and her daughter Taylor are two of the most up beat people you could ever meet. It's hard not to smile when you are in the section. I have never had a bad meal here. Best burgers in the valley. And yes they have Bud Light Draft!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! We have never had a bad meal here! Cactus Shadows Pasta is excellent! Cindy is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"We have loved this place for so long great food, amazing service, and comfortable atmosphere. Ask for Cindy"}
{"text":"Adriana Bartlett Gray Hey, Cave Creek friends, just had dinner at Brisams and have to share that it was AWESOME!!! I know its tucked away in a strip mall behind Tutor Time (not the best location). But, I just had the best fish tacos there EVER! And, let me tell you I LOVE fish tacos so order them everywhere. First of all, the fish was not fried (hate that), second it was mahi mahi (good fish in the tacos). For 50 cents more, you can get it blackened (if you like spice) AND is topped with chipotle mayo (which I asked extra for from the beginning because I am a spicy girl). What can I say, these were the best fish tacos in my 42 years and I've eaten fish tacos at at LEAST 30+ places here and nothing came close. To top it off, we had some dessert that included half cooked cookie dough topped with ice cream, hot fudge, etc. That rivals any dessert I have ever had ANYWHERE including the most expensive restaurants anywhwhere in the greater Phoenix area. My husband also had the steak dinner and ate the whole thing which he doesn't even do at the ultra expensive steakhouses here. The kids, of course, had chicken fingers and a cheeseburger and liked them, didn't rave, but what the heck. They're kids! So, if you're in CC, I highly recommend this place. Its hidden and doesn't look like much from outside, but you will be surprised!"}
