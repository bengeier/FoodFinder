{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday evening and there were just a few customers. Service was ok, but only ok. I had the veal which had too much oil left on the plate. More suburban hot table quality as opposed to what you'd expect from this area. Will give it another try someday soon so obviously not totally disenchanted but they should have been better."}
{"text":"We are usually not steered wrong when a restaurant has an average 4 star rating. But we were sorely disappointed. The small restaurant was quite full and busy (although we began at 8 pm so most dinners were on dessert/ coffee), and we had the last available table. There was only one server for all, and one person in the kitchen. We found the server curt and abrupt. The cold avocado-cucumber-mint soup was underwhelming; my wife found some piece of organic, inedible, wood-like material (the stem, perhaps). The poached pear salad would have been nice: but came with a very disappointing amount of goat cheese. The menu described our main \"with greens\". I assumed that meant cooked rapini, broccolini or Swiss chard, but instead was simply romaine lettuce and arugula. We left without dessert."}
{"text":"After a rather disappointing excursion to a nearby restaurant, my friend and I decided to explore the street for an alternative to our lunch.

Lo and behold, a very warm and modern eatery within our sights.

We were seated promptly and given extremely friendly service.

I ordered the veal sandwich with fries while my friend devoured (there was no sauce left at the end of meal due to meticulous consumption) the gnocchi. Tables around us were enamored with varieties of poached eggs, a delight that I will most certainly try next time. 

I have to say, the price to quality ratio surprised me, especially in an area as Rosedale. Plus, despite the handsome decor, there was never a feeling of pretentiousness from the staff. 

Avant Gout, thank you for salvaging my afternoon."}
{"text":"This small and inviting restaurant has become our favorite spot to have a great meal at a fair price. A very nice menu with popular daily specials.
My wife loves the steak and frites and I have tried almost everything on the menu and several specials, with very few disappointments.
The wine list is good and the wait staff very efficient and friendly.
We never have desert but I have seen other enjoying same."}
{"text":"It's Sunday in Toronto.  You want to meet a friend for brunch and chat. And you want a place where you aren't warehoused in and out the door in less than 45 minutes, while screaming your tonsils raw over ear-splitting music.
 
Not a dream. It's Avant Gout, by night a French-cum-Moroccan bistro with delectable menu. And by day - weekends only - it's arguably the most brunch-friendly eatery in the city. The classic Eggs Benny comes done to taste with rich Hollandaise and juicy rounds of peameal bacon served with a tender (no iceberg) salad, or cajun fries.  For sheer indulgence, it's the toothsome popping-fresh blueberry pancakes that melt under a drizzle of maple syrup. All served with brio and Ã©lan - and some of the city's best coffee, latte or espresso.
 
Another plus: breaking Toronto's rule of extortionate prices for pleasant food and surroundings, Avant Gout is surprisingly reasonable.  Best of all, you leave with a smile, not a day-long headache.

{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal. The grilled squid was heavenly and the Moroccan lamb shank was also exceptional. The atmosphere was also very good"}
{"text":"I stopped in at Avant Gout for brunch this morning. The staff were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was nice, lots of locals coming in for brunch, greeting the staff by name. Coffee arrived quickly and was delicious.

The brunch menu had a good number of items on it, lots of variety. I chose the Avant Gout omelette, with spinach, red onion, mushrooms, and goat cheese. It was served with home fries, and I had salad and fruit instead of a piece of toast. 

There was a nice selection of fruit, but the salad didn't taste like much and the home fries, while nicely seasoned, were under-cooked. My omelette was alright, lots of veggies but the smearing of goat cheese on the top made it seem like a stingy afterthought.

Unlikely to be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went for our traditional Saturday morning brunch last weekend and wanted to embark on a new brunch spot.

After brainstorming, one of my best friends recommended Avant Gout. She had a great dinner experience there recently and thought it would be great for brunch.

She was definitely correct on her prediction!

The three of us ventured to Avant Gout in a gorgeous Rosedale area for a yummy brunch, complete with great service and a table overlooking busy and vibrant Yonge street.

However, do not let the beautiful and rich atmosphere fool you about the pricing. The prices here are NOT EXPENSIVE, which is great because you can have your meal in a beautiful and classy setting without the crazy hole in your pocket.

For brunch, I ordered the pancakes, which came with Canadian maple syrup and seasonal fruit. The portion includes 3 HUGE PANCAKES and a pile of fruit. The pancakes were sweet and buttery and melted in my mouth with a covering of the maple syrup. The fruit was fresh and juicy.

To wash it down, I ordered a latte as well, which was a medium-sized drink.

The pancakes were only $8.49 and the latte was only $4. 

My friends ordered the \"Everything Omelette\" and the \"Mediterranean Platter\", which I personally sampled myself.

The Everything Omelette is HUGE, only $10.99 and is a mixture of eggs, smoked salmon, cheddar cheese, onions, tomatoes and mushrooms.

The Mediterranean Platter is large as well, $10.95 and is a unique mixture of pita bread, hummus, grilled eggplant, hard boiled eggs, cucumber, tomatoes, olives and feta cheese.

My brunch experience was fabulous, so I would recommend Avant Gout to anyone. I look forward to my future visits for lunch and dinner at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  We enjoyed our dining experience from Cesar salads to recommended entrees with wine and desserts with cordials.  We were not rushed bit we're attended to very nicely.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing service and attention given to guests. The owner offered to open the restaurant 15 minutes early as my girlfriend and I had to catch a play at 7 PM. Food is decent and well done. Nothing spectacular though."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were out for a birthday celebration and Avant Gout took us all by surprise. The food and the service is excellent. The decor is warm and cozy and the food is delicious. I had the roasted beet salad. The beets were sliced like carpacico and a mound of mixed greens on top with shaved parmesan cheese. The dressing was light and didn't weigh down the salad. For my main I had the beef short ribs and frites and the short ribs were deliciously moist and melted in your mouth. We had a great time and thorougly enjoyed our food and the atmosphere. The prices for the quality of food cannot be beat. I will definitely go back. It's a little gem in the Rosedale neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed with this place. I took a stroll down Yonge Street from Summerhill to Rosedale and had a glance at their brunch menu last week and thought I'd give it a try today for brunch since the prices seemed reasonable for such a place.

E g g s   N a t a s h a  (smoked salmon)
- Egg poached perfectly
- only one piece of salmon per egg
- salmon was way too salty
- came with only salad + fruit (not much though)

Overall: Won't be comin' back. There are better places to go."}
{"text":"Great little french restaurant in Rosedale. Try the steak frites! The service was quick and friendly."}
