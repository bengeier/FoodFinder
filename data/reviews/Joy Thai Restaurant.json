{"text":"I found this place to be awesome. Spring rolls for a starter were fresh, Pad Thai very tasty an the Creamy Red Beef Curry out of this world.  This uptown spot is a real gem. We've lived in the neighbourhood two years and were embarrassed it was our first time there. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I often stop in for lunch. The food is always fresh and hot and comes quickly. The menu is small for lunch and I really wish it had more selection for lunch specials. That said everything I've tasted has been of good quality and delicious."}
{"text":"The cooks are amazing , especially the short thai lady she is always smiling the food is awesome   The server with the gray hat is rude if you don't tip him - he will question you if the service was bad ?"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, good portion sizes, and reasonable prices. Three of us had main dishes and starters for around $60 total. I don't know what previous reviews are referring to when they say they had bad service. We had a great experience and the server was knowledgable about the menu. He knew which items were gluten free and which items could be modified to be made gluten free, which eased my mind. The restaurant is small and isn't glamorous or anything, but the decor is simple and it's clean. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here on a whim based on Yelp recommendations. The food was delicious and the price is right. It is a.family owned restaurant and the service is genuine. The restaurant could improve on their ambiance but the bathrooms are spotless."}
{"text":"Service excellent. Food is always good and consistent. Ambience is kind of cheap with mint walls and diner chairs.   Red curry beef/chicken ($11) is awesome.   I think they recently raised the prices though after they upgraded their menus. Edging towards all the rest of the expensier Lawrence restaurants which sucks.   Go for the food not the ambience."}
{"text":"Came here a few times since I recently moved into the neighbourhood. It's a very simple restaurant that has a small town feel to it. It's good for casual, no frills dining.  I've ordered the pad thai (a bit too salty for my taste, but extremely flavourful) and green and yellow curry dishes here. The curries were very good - good cuts of chunky chicken and enough sauce for three bowls of rice. I wish the dishes came with rice though cause their sauce is so good.   I've never seen this place full since the decor is not that inviting and it is rather dim in there, but I'm glad I walked in and tried it. We never had to wait in line and it's good value for the food, especially in this area!"}
{"text":"Room temp water. I special request a glass full of ice to accompany my ordered beverage. I get 1/2 full glass of Freezer burned ice cubes. Delicious shrimp and scallop app with amazing peanut sauce. Then: Undercooked and Under seasoned beef that went cold really quickly. No knife. over salted shrimp fried rice. \"Green Salad\" that came with the beef was just shreds of iceberg lettuce and a few slivers of red pepper and carrot and a tiny circle of cucumber with delicious dressing.  Small portions for price. Smelly spray used by waitress to clean table right next to us while we're still eating. 30 minutes later, I'm sick ass."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places. Spicy noodles are amazing. As is the green and yellow curries. Cold spring rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Very nice family restaurant, place is not as modern as the upscale glitzy joints but food is delish! Will add to our rotation of takeouts."}
{"text":"This is my default Thai Take-Out restaurant. The food is tasty and inexpensive.  I don't think I would ever choose to eat-in here as there isn't much of an atmosphere and the times I have been there has been only a couple diners in the entire establishment but I have never been by on a Friday or Saturday night so don't trust my opinion on this too much.   What you should trust though is that their Green Thai Curry and Basil Chicken are delicious, as is any other food I've tried from there.   My friends all agree, this place is an understated gem."}
{"text":"Best Thai takeout in Toronto!  Highly recommend the Pad Thai, Beef Satay, and Green Curry Chicken"}
{"text":"Best shrimp chips ive ever had!! The yellow curry is amazing I had it almost every day as I worked in the area. Its a cute little family run joint, the food is fresh, authentic and delicious, highly recommend it. Its a hidden little neighboorhood jem."}
{"text":"Hum.  Well, it's inexpensive.  I went for the chicken satay and pad thai, and both were fine; not horribly authentic, but tasty.  The staff seemed knowledgeable about which items on their menu were gluten-free, which was good for my friend.  The service was just fine, and the food arrived hot.    Unfortunately, the restaurant itself left something to be desired.  It was a bit dreary - more dingy and bleak than one generally finds in this neighbourhood - but it was also downright chilly.  Now, it was a cold night, but inadequate insulation and a broken interior door also contributed to keeping us uncomfortably cool. In their favour, the bathroom was spotless.  I can see ordering in from this place or maybe having a quick lunch, but it's not much fun for a catch-up session with an old friend."}
{"text":"Caught up with some friends over dinner on a Wednesday around 6:00 pm. There is parking both along Yonge St and the side streets nearby so it is not a big problem (and close to Lawrence Station). Didn't know what to expect as I was the latest one (out of 6 people) to arrive. The restaurant had one or two other tables occupied during our time there.   The appearance of the restaurant is a bit dated, but gets the job done - you can tell it is a small family type restaurant right away. Ordered the Pad Thai, and I liked the chewiness of the noodles, but the toppings were not that great. The chicken tasted bland and was a bit too chewy. The service was not the quickest but it was friendly at the same time.       For $11, the portion was a pretty good size and everyone else in my group seemed decently full as well. However I'm usually not around this area often, so I would probably want to see how restaurants nearby compare first before considering coming back."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and great food. Take out Thai is awesome. Give yourself 25 minutes and call ahead.  I also like to go sit down and is usually space without waiting. Joy Thai is an enjoyable small family run restaurant. Suitable for kids and small parties."}
{"text":"Best thai food I have ever had. Has the best pad thai and basil chicken out there. Restaurant has a great vibe in it, service is great and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for take out. Was glad we were taking it out. The dining room was clean and bright,  but sparse and empty. Not much for ambience. I must admit my expectations were pretty low for Thai in North Toronto. In that sense it exceeded expectations. It's the best takeout Thai that I've had in North Toronto. The phad thai was OK. It tasted like phad thai. The shrimp curry did contain a lot of shrimp."}
{"text":"Saw online that it was overall rated a 4.5 so we went in. After visiting I wouldn't rate it as highly. Very good service, the server was attentive and friendly but the food was just average thai food. We ate the vegetable spring rolls which were very bland, 2 orders of pad thai (very minimal toppings and also bland tasting) and 2 thai vegetable soups (also mediocre but the best part of the meal). Wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Over rated. Went there because I happened to be working in the area, ordered a padthai, taste is very plain and blend, thai express has better padthai. Asked for spicy and it's not spicy at all. It supposedly comes with shrimp and chicken, $11, it has only 2 pieces of shrimp.   Service, the lady is rude.  Uber eats has better options."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Saw the 4 star review, we were looking for a place to grab some lunch.  For atmosphere they get one star.  For service they get a 4 star, quick, polite, attentive but not over bearing.  Food we ordered   Thai ice tea - standard nothing special Mango salad - slightly over seasoned but the mango and the shrimps were delicious and perfect  Lunch red curry chicken with Tom yum soup - tasty Pad Thai with spring roll - the noodles were great but disappointing tofu (tasted a little sour like they are starting to spoil)  Overall, clean and quick friendly service.  Probably will give one more try to see if deserve 4 star but for now just three stars."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I appreciated the good service I received here, but the lunch I had was not 4-star calibre.  Searching for the best Thai restaurants north of Eglinton, this one came up out of the ones I haven't been to yet. I decided to take the trip here for a Wednesday lunch, arriving at exactly noon. Originally the restaurant wasn't busy, but the place was full by the time I left 45 minutes later.  I ordered the chicken pad thai with tom yum chicken soup. Both dishes came at the same time, even though I expected the soup to arrive first. The tom yum chicken soup tasted quite good; not overpowerly spicy at all. However, I was not impressed with the pad thai here. The chicken was good, but the noodles themselves were way too chewy. Now normally I like chewy, but not to the point it takes a significant effort to chew it. The salad had no sauce, so it felt like eating lettuce, carrot, and red peppers straight from a bag.  If I were in the area I would probably stick to Sorn Thai down the street. I personally liked that place more, especially the pad thai there."}
{"text":"Joy Thai is a great neighbourhood spot and I've been going there for years.  What it lacks in ambience, it makes up in flavour.  The walls and decor are barren and the restaurant is not often full, however I think they do a decent take-out business. I'm rating it a 4 purely based on food and service but the overall dining experience leaves a lot to be desired.   Whether I'm dining in or taking it with me, the service has always been typically Thai: friendly.  Their prices are reasonable and in-line with the other standard Thai joints I've been to and so I find it a good value.  You can expect all of your Thai standards here. There's no stand-out dish but everything I've tried has been good, even if expected.  I certainly recommend this place for take out or for a quick bite however I don't suggest it for a special meal out or even one where you plan on doing a lot of intimate talking as this place is bare and QUIET: no background music or anything and if there's another table seated in the restaurant, you can usually eavesdrop on their conversation. The place is small and in the winter, if you're seated near the door you'll often feel a cold gust of air every time the door opens, even with the new entryway they installed.  Anyway, I posted photos of the menu and the last meal I brought home."}
{"text":"I came to Joy Thai restaurant for Thursday lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The service was very friendly and the food came quickly. Joy Thai restaurant prices were affordable. The restaurant was not crowded when I arrived, but became busy afterward.  I ordered the shrimp chips and the chicken pad thai. The shrimp chips was good, but not very hot. The pad thai was delicious and not overcooked.  Would I come back? Yes, since the food was good and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Love the Thai Iced tea!  We love this thai restaurant.  Great lunch special too."}
{"text":"What a lovely family run restaurant!  It is unassuming with décor.  Basic simple friendly!  GREAT food!  I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for almost 10 years. Family-run, it is small and efficient.  We usually have the stir-fried tofu, the hot and sour soup.   The decor of the place is a bit dated since it has not been renovated all these years.   The service is quick on most days, but Friday evenings can be a challenge with a large takeout order list."}
