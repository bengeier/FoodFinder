{"text":"Warm atmosphere, smiling faces and cold beer!  Oh and a great menu with excellent food. Try the meatballs and the mignulata. Very delicious. Pizza choices include tasty standards like sausage (from local favorite DeFalco's) and more trendy tastes like fig and goat cheese. I wish it was closer to home. We would have our own permanent table!"}
{"text":"So I call to order a Salad and some Meatballs for take out.   Well for more than 45min I try to call, and at first no answer what so ever, just rings and rings, then it just starts going to voicemail immediately. I call and I call and I call. Nothing no one answer but voicemail  I mean WT@, what kind of restaurant does not answer their phone during business hours.   The ironic and even sadder thing is that on their voicemail they tell you if your calling for takeout don't leave a message, call back and talk to someone to place your order.   lol  Are you kidding me!   Talk to someone???   Maybe I would if someone would answer the phone.   Obviously they know this is an issue otherwise why leave that message about take out.  I guess they just don't care  So I call my wife to tell her that I have been unable to get through, as she is already on her way  there because she naturally thought the order would have been placed by now, she tells me she will just place the order when she gets there.   Well guess what?  She gets there to place the order and they tell her that it will be more than an hour wait.  An hour wait for Salad and Meatball's?   What a JOKE!   Tell me how does it take an hour to make salad and stick some already cooked meatballs in a to-go container with some sauce and get you on your way???  I WILL NEVER SPEND ANOTHER DIME IN THIS PLACE EVER.   HAVE A NICE DAY! Lamp Pizzeria"}
{"text":"LAMP was very good. The staff was friendly and service was great. We got antipasta, a grape and gorgonzola salad and the Gem pizza for three of us to share. The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted good. It is a bit pricey but not unusual for the area it is located. The main reason for the four stars (rather than five) is I didn't like the food quite as much as some comparable places in No Scottsdale. I would definitely go again though."}
{"text":"Love the salads and great bread!  I WILL get in the car for GREAT BREAD!  Not bad pricing for such a pricy neighborhood.  Next time I will have to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Delicious grapes and gorgonzola salad, arugula pizza and toasted marshmallow shakes for dessert."}
{"text":"Delicious. Up from downtown Phoenix where there are many yummy pies. Family was starving after a event up north. The Lamp fit the bill. The salads we loves by the kids and the adults. The pizzas were amazing!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is by far our favorite. We've tasted pizza all over the world and Lamp Pizza is the best. Matt the owner makes it perfect every time. Brooke, Sam, Jesse and the rest of the gang always make you feel right at home. Everything on the menu is delicious. If you want great pizza THIS IS THE PLACE."}
{"text":"OK, here's the funny part - Lamp is located about 5 or so storefronts from a Pizza Hut. OK, I found that funny.  On to my review.  This place is pretty awesome. The interior is long, narrow, and dark.  The kitchen, along with the gigantic wood oven, takes up one half of the space with tables taking up the other half.  I've been here a few times and the service has always been excellent.  You'll find a number of starters including soup and salads. I go for the Mignulata (a stuffed bread) which is delicious. They offer a variety of red and white pizzas but you can add ingredients if you have some favorite toppings.  They also have an OK wine list; it's not extensive but you'll no doubt find something you like.  Here's the dilemma. The pizzas are 12 inches cut into 6 slices.  If I have an appetizer there's no way I can finish a 12 inch pizza so the leftovers go home. My experience has been that leftover pizza doesn't taste near as good when reheated. This is especially true for thin crust pizzas - the crust gets overcooked.   Even if I don't have an appetizer, that's a lot of pizza.  My solution is to share an appetizer and a pizza.  As long as neither of you are big eaters this should work for you. If you're still hungry, they have a nice dessert menu or you can stop by the Pizza Hut (j/k)."}
{"text":"Needs to work out some kinks . .  We were very excited to try the Lamp as it is just around the corner from us.  Came on a Friday night with four people and waited about 15 minutes.  No problem as there were seats for us at the front bar.  Decent wine selection, I ordered white, which was not quite chilled enough.  We asked about draft beer and was told that \"people in North Scottsdale don't like draft beer--they'd close us if we had it.\"  Pretty ridiculous comment as we all know plenty of places this far north (and further north) that have draft beer.  All he had to say was no -- we were just asking.    When we got to the table, service was a little slow, the waiter brought over a little appetizer for us (bread with sausage inside), which was nice.  We each ordered our own pizza, but that's really not necessary.  Each pizza could definitely feed two people.  The pizza toppings were good, very fresh, great cheese, and not underdone. The crust of the pizza was fine on the ends but thin and soggy in the middle.  Fixing this make for a much better pizza.  But for a really great pizza, I'll still go to Oreganos.  The Lamp has the potential to be as good as Humble Pie, but hasn't quite reached it yet.  The people who worked there were very nice, though, and we'll probably give it another try."}
{"text":"First timers and loved it antipasto app and white pizza with garlic, mushrooms and prosciutto were delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"Good food! The pizza was awesome! Loved the marshmallow milkshake,it's as a good dessert! Will come a again."}
{"text":"Food was so good! Got the caprese salad, with the most delicious variety of tomatoes and sweet delicious balsamic and basil. The white Little Yorks pizza was so yummy too! Lots of delicious Italian meats. Wine selection was great, we got the red blend. Enjoy! This is get you in the Italian country side mood food! The only regret you'll have will be that your next stop isn't Tuscany!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, are go to stop. Expensive though as two pies are $30+, too bad there weren't more beers on tap. 3 stars/would be four/possibly 4 1/2 if they dropped there prices."}
{"text":"I've been here three times with my parents and it's turned into one of our new favorite restaurants! I've tried three of the salads, the grapes and gorgonzola and the antipasto were my favorites however, I wasn't really a fan of the grilled vegetable salad. My parents always get a pizza and I'm not sure which ones they have gotten but they're always really good! I've also gotten the meatballs as an appetizer and they were good but not anything too special. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, they brought my salad just as I had asked for it. Overall, I haven't had a bad experience at this restaurant and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am from New York and always asked where do I get best pizza? Hands down Lamps Pizzeria is the BEST!!!!!!  Always fresh ingredients and friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"Our goal was to go to the home and garden show but due to circumstances beyond our control, we decided to go to lunch instead. While looking for a place to go to lunch, we stopped in this strip mall. The consensus was pizza, so we went to Lamp Pizzeria. We were greeted warmly and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside and to go ahead and pick a table and she would follow us with the menus. The patio is perfect and they are very dog friendly. Lots of choices of regular pizzas and some white pizzas. Since we had three people in our party, we ordered the Gem and the Kensington with anchovies on the side. We also ordered an assortment of olives  and some artisan bread. OMG - WOW cannot even begin to describe how much we enjoyed everything! The service was wonderful, the selection is unbelievable (and hard to make a decision too) and the food - excellent! This is our new favorite pizza place. If you like figs and white pizza, definitely try the Kensington!  It was not super sweet, the figs and cheese together brought a whole new dimension to a white pizza. The Gem was perfect too and we would be hard pressed to decide on only one pizza. We were glad we didn't order a salad on top of everything too. The size of the pizzas are about 12\" and the salads at the neighboring tables looked more than enough for two people. We ended up taking home about half a pizza but we managed to eat the whole loaf of bread and 90% of the olives. We will even order a pizza to go in the future, since we don't live too far from this great pizza place! We also intend to go next door and try the Lamp Cafe - which is mainly sandwiches. Great job guys! Oh as an added plus, we warmed up leftovers today and they were just as yummy. GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"It's certainly bomb. The pizza of course and antipasto are a must try on your first visit. They also make a killer mushroom soup on occasion. It's even a good spot for a quick to-go order. A terrific asset to the North Scottsdale area. I do wish they served frosted mugs with the cold beer."}
{"text":"service was quite friendly and attentive, and the food was great.  the fig/goat cheese/mint bruschetta doused lightly with fig sambuca was delicious, though its relative heaviness and sweetness reminded me more of dessert rather than appetizer.   roasted vegetable salad could be a meal by itself....very satisfying because it is not by any means a small serving and includes rich goat cheese and is served with wood fired bread on the side.  nothing better than wood-fired pizza (and bread)! the pizza with artichoke, red peppers, and mushrooms was phenomenal. the rappini pizza i sampled was good, but missing something....more garlic and onion perhaps?  the bread here was heavenly (as good or better than bianco), as was the pizza dough on both pizzas i tried. crispy on the outside without being fossilized or burnt, and chewy on the inside. lamp definitely has a handle on the bread/dough aspect.  i didn't try dessert, but the ones listed on the menu read highly tasty and unique in print...."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The service is always great.  The pizza and salads are incredible.  It's nice to have a gourmet, wood fired pizza place close to home."}
{"text":"We wanted to be in the area for the beautiful weather and sunset and found this place. Samantha was our fantastic server - truly some of the best service in recent memory and we eat out at least twice a week.    Had try white bean and arugula salad which was light and delicious. Big enough for up to three but the two of us finished it because it was too good to waste. We shared the Gem and boy is it. Rich topping and a crunchy crust. Well seasoned with fresh oregano.   It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We are HUGE fans of LAMP! Not since Italy have we had a more delicious wood-fired pizza! The salads, sangria, and meatballs are scrumptious, as well."}
{"text":"We tried almost all the pizza places in Arizona. We have been here several times and tried some of the pizzas. We would rate the place 4 for the quality of pizza. The crust is well done. Their nutella pizza is so yummy. The kicker, Margherita pizzas are really good.  The service is so slow and it is disappointing to sit with empty glasses and the waiters not paying attention. The place deserves 4 stars but with that service, I would give it only 3."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious.   Great salads and daily homemade soup, You will not be disappointed with the food, but it can get a little loud but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Simply....... This place is divine, and very authentic. Make the trip and have the Marinara pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in years! Gets busy early so be prepared to wait but it's well worth it. Upscale."}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients here is excellent and well researched.  Nice Italian style pepperoni not the usual cheap greasy stuff, delicious moist white anchovies.  Inspired menu.  Fresh crunchy salad, decent size for the price.  Great thin crust Neapolitan style pizza. Live locally and have eaten here several times, a couple of minor complaints; occasional inconsistency in the pizza dough, sometimes can be a little heavy & extra toppings pricey.  Busy, rustic, nice atmosphere, friendly staff! Wouldn't hesitate to return again & again."}
{"text":"I heard about this new restaurant and decided to try it out this evening. I have to say that I can't wait to go back. The arugula and white bean salad with red wine vinaigrette was one of the best salads I've had. I added chicken to it and it's large enough to be a meal. It's served with 2 pieces of crostini that is made from the bread that they make fresh daily. Too bad they don't sell the bread separately. But you need to leave some room for the pizza. It's made in an authentic wood burning oven and the red sauce and cheese they use are incredibly good and fresh. I just had a piece of the Margherita pizza that my friend ordered and I was convinced they knew how to make pizza here. The owner takes pride in everything that gets served and has been known to toss out anything he feels is not perfect and start all over. I can't wait to go back and try the different pizzas and salads. This is a great local restaurant located at the northeast corner pf Pinnacle Peak and Pima Rd and I recommend it very highly."}
{"text":"Overall good place. Pizza was good and a great selection. The service however was really slow and non-attentive. Took 30 minutes after being seated to have wine and sodas at the table. Cute place, but the acoustics need some help, very noisy. Would go back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went to Lamp last night with a girlfriend.  We ordered the antepasto salad and it ws delicious especially the accompanying bread.  We ordered a pizza with sausage and pepperoni and it was delicious.  The only negative was the crust got soggy.  The ingrediants are delcious--the service is excellent.  One downside is that there were a couple of screaming babies at 7:30."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  New York pizza in Scottsdale. 6 people in party and EVERYONE loved it. Olives antipasto zucchini patties meatballs. Ceasar salad. Tomato fresh mozzarella salad.  Sausage Pizza, ask for calabria hot oil on side. Also Calabria Pepper pizza was excellent. Gelato was great as well. Service is excellent ask for Samantha. We had alot of....extra this, none of that, substitute this and everything came out as ordered. Thanks Samantha"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and the rest of the menu is fantastic as well. What a great experience! Nothing not to love about this place!"}
{"text":"We did enjoy our starting garlic shrimp appetizer and the Spicy Vodka hot condiment was a plus point. But pizza connoisseurs like us have tasted the finest Napoli treats and I'm sad to say that although topping wise Lamp does a truly good job to source excellent product, the one singular ingredient to create remarkable pizza missed the mark and that my friends is the pizza dough itself.  Whether it likely a poor imported flour ratio or over rested dough, but whatever the case it makes for tough and hard as cardboard texture. Sorry to say we'll likely not return for this reason as well as DC Ranch pricepoints. We'll stick with our other Scottsdale fave for now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Try the meatball appetizer but save room for the best wood-oven pizza in AZ!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Always a great meal. Everything from salads to pizzas to milkshakes are delicious!!"}
{"text":"\"I love Lamp\" -Brick Tamland  All kidding aside this place can hold it's own with some of the top pizza powers in Phoenix. (eg. Bianco, Cibo).  Very Impressed!"}
{"text":"We have been here so many times we feel like family :)  My daughter loves the Simple salad with sauteed chicken and the Toasted Marshmallow milkshake.  My favorite is the Grapes and Gorgonzola salad with grilled chicken and the Pepperoni pizza with Piquante peppers (I can't get enough!)  The service is always great and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is FABULOUS in every way! Clean & spacious.  GREAT staff.    Fig-Sambuca Bruschetta appetizer is one of the best things I've ever eaten.  My gosh, what a perfect combination of ingredients on perfectly toasted bread.  Big chunks of soft figs in their own sauce - kind of like a compote.  Smears of goat cheese.  All sprinkled with fresh mint.  Yes, mint!  WONDERFUL!  Neapolitan style pizza - perfectly baked in a wood fired oven.  I ordered a Geppetto, which they were super nice about customizing.  I subbed mushrooms for the sausage.  It's a white pizza which comes with Gorgonzola and Carmelized Onion Marmalade.  I added Sicilian Cured Black Olives.  Absolutely delicious.  Dessert - tried the caramelized banana Nutella pizza.  I've had many, many versions of Nutella pizza, and this one was distinct in that they applied the Nutella prior to baking which gave a toasty crunchiness that I really enjoyed.  It comes with a side of orange honey Ricotta cream, which it absolutely does not need.  If you use it, the dessert takes on a cheesecake flavor.  I found it was perfect on its own.  An outstanding meal, thank you!!"}
{"text":"So from the start we had high hopes for this restaurant based of a positive recommendation from a friend.   Once we had been seated it was a good 12 min before someone even offered us water and a drink order. When we placed our drink order we also placed our food order.  At the 45 min mark our salads arrived, well one arrived and we where told the other was in the way and a few minutes later it came. The salads, a simple and a Caesar both where both amazing.   From this point things turned south. When the pizzas arrived, now at the one hour mark, the waiter Cole grabbed my salad plate from me while I was still eating the last few bites. It was very rude and unapologetic about it.   One of the pizzas was not the one we ordered but the waiter told us that it's simply the way they do it and offered to pick the basil off like that is something we want.   The pizzas are just ok. Nothing worth the wait and bad service.   All in all we won't be back. The service and wait times are some of the worst we have ever had and to make matters worse it was a Tuesday so it wasn't like it was a busy night. No manager to be found and very unorganized.  Food would come out in partial orders with just the three of us.   Save your money and time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in the valley. Along with superb appetizers and soups, Lamp has become a weekly visit.  The owners and staff are friendly and pleasant.  The service is always top notch, unlike other pizza establishments we have visited.  The best true Napolitano pizza in AZ.  Be sure to try the milkshakes. The kids love them."}
{"text":"Best wood oven pizza I have had in Phoenix. The kicker is delicious with a ton of flavor. Make sure to have water by you because it is spicy!! Great job LAMP!  I will be back. I ate to much so I couldn't get dessert but will try the Nutella Milkshake next time!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by letting you know grimaldis is my favorite pizzeria so you know that you can trust my review, obviously that's the best pizza in the world. Lamp isn't a Barros, this is pizza that's fit for more than a middle school cafeteria. The restaurant is a cute little place with a tiny brick oven, seems like a poor business decision but they got our pizza out fast enough and it was delivious. They have a nice variety of house pizzas and also the option to build whatever you like. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Try \"the Simple\" and add the prosciutto.  Earthy, salty with a touch of sweet.  For dessert, don't miss the Nutella milkshake.  Yes. Nutella."}
{"text":"There is a lot of competition in Phoenix for wood fired pizza. Out of your options of Bianco/Grimaldi's/La Grande Orange/CPK, the pizza in itself here ranks in the middle. Given how busy the other places get, if you are located in the area, I highly recommend this little place.   They have wine and some bottled beer, the salads are quality and fresh, but I wouldn't go there just for a salad. For the pizza selection you have fairly standard gourmet options, ingredients are top notch, and the crust is made fresh daily. The pizza is mouth watering when you see it and is equally satisfying when the warm crust hits your mouth.  This place opened up recently and I see myself there quite a bit."}
{"text":"Fantastic and cool pizza spot in Scottsdale mall. We had a big family lunch over Christmas week. Great, friendly service and awesome food  I'm not sure I can identify the pizza style -- not deep dish or thin enough to call thin-crust. The crust is pretty bread-y here.  My favorite was the white mushroom pizza, several kinds of mushroom and rich and flavorful. The Gem was a crowd favorite -- sausage, pepperoni, ricotta and oregano I think. The Kicker was a spicy version of the Gem and quite good - not too spicy btw. I think everything had garlic, which obviously made it even more delicious  We also had a number of the salads and apps to start. Meatballs were delicious. Big enough to split meatballs in half and still have a decent bite. I really liked the antipasto salad, which is peppers, artichoke, cheese on lettuce. Also good was white bean and arugula salad, a bit more 'meaty'.  I was starving when we arrived and ordered an Amaretti Cookie milkshake, which was AMAZEBALLS. This might be top few milkshakes of my life -- cookies, salted caramel gelato and toasted marshmallow. We actually had them split it in two glasses and it was the perfect amount (wanted more but would have felt awful afterwards). I love that they have the option to make their shakes \"adult\" by adding Frangelico and other alcoholic deliciousness."}
{"text":"We finally decided to give Lamp a try and we were glad we did. It's a great little gourmet pizza place with a nice vibe to it. The service was excellent and the speed of the food coming out was perfect. We shared the spinach salad and Gem pizza - both we're great and we left very full.   My only request is to add a happy hour menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Scottsdale, and probably best pizza in Arizona! The vegetables taste fresh and atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. We waited for our pizza at the bar and the bartender, James was very nice and assisting us while we waited for our pizza. Will be recommending this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"We go to lamp pizza all the time, I can't figure out why I'm just getting around to writing a review....  The stuffed bread is so delicious, I could easily just have it as my meal.  The olives are really good too. I've tried the arugula and white bean salad and the tomato and mozz salad, the ingredients are incredibly fresh and the portions are generous.  We've tried a bunch of different pizzas margherita, grandma, simple, gem and they have all been great but the simple might be my favorite - you really can't go wrong no matter what you pick.  The location is convenient and there is plenty of parking.  They get really busy, even for take out so be prepared to wait.  The pizza is very thin so it has been cold when getting take out a couple of times but that doesn't bother me.  Their artisan bread is off the hook but they charge you for it if it doesn't come with what you order - that bugs me but not enough to take away a star."}
{"text":"We DO like their pizza but we have to save up for it ... yes, it's a pricey piece of dough. Eating inside can be a little loud. The decor is nice, but they could use a larger space where the bathroom door isn't right next to the tables. There is the option to eat outside, which we prefer. One time we got the pizzas to go and ate it in the park behind the restaurant. Of course, if you do that, you can't have alcohol and their sangrias are pretty good. Our favorite pizza is the Scientist. Best employee there is the bartender. Make sure you say hello."}
{"text":"I love this place and can't wait to go back in the beautiful warm weather to sit on their patio and languish over another delicious pizza!  We have tried all the newer pizza places that have sprung up in North Scottsdale, but none have come close to LAMP's fresh ingredients and perfectly done thin crust. I had a hard time making up my mind on which ingredients to add to my pizza. (There is usually something I want on all the different pizzas, and because I'm not a meat person, I make my own combo.)  This night it was onion, mushroom and ricotta. The wood roasted crimini mushrooms were so tasty I could have eaten them all by themselves, and the onion, which was described as a caramelized onion marmalade, was amazing. I think I picked a winner!   My husband had \"The Scientist\" which was topped with different kinds of salami and green olives. He devoured every bite in record time. Our friend had the Grilled Vegetable version and she, too, ate it all, except a few pieces of crust! We all agreed that we would definitely go back!  At LAMP, they don't over-sauce the red pizzas so you get to taste all the flavors of the toppings. If you make your own, they advise not picking more than four toppings so that the pizza slice will still be manageable to eat . . . .as it should be. (I try to stay away from knife and fork pizzas!)  A friend of mine was there a couple weeks ago and raved about the Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake . . . I begged my husband to order one so I could taste it, but he said we'd save it for another time when he remembers to leave a couple pieces of his pie to take home. He was just too full!  Our server was friendly and attentive, and gave us plenty of time to make up our minds. He was efficient, but not intrusive.  The restaurant itself is pretty funky, but comfortable. The red tile LAMP oven is one of the centerpieces of the room. I loved the mixed up chair designs. The space is comfortable. By 6:30 pm, the place was packed with couples, families and groups of friends. I can see LAMP having great success as it is unpretentious but serves up some great food.    In the immortal words of Arnold . . . \"I'll be back . . . \""}
{"text":"This literally the best pizza I've ever had.  I did not know pizza could have such complex flavors. It was our Anniversary and our server was Cole and he was awesome.  Keep in mind it is real wood oven pizza so they can only cook 3 at a time so the foid does take a while to come iut but more then worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing!! We ablsolutley love it there! Me and the family go there almost nightly and in fact tonight we're ordering take out! We've never experienced any cons about it there. Amazing food and great service."}
{"text":"Had an issue a few weeks ago but the owner did reach out to us to make up for the problem that we had.  Enjoyed the pizza's second time around and will be back.  Thank you"}
{"text":"FIRST TIME IN and I live close by.  Arrived about about 645 pm and the place was full but not packed.  Hostess was super friendly and the server was great.  Food was fantastic.  Highly recommend .  In fact I will return and I'm treating all my clients from Arizona Real Estate Connection to dinner....We will be back"}
{"text":"great service, incredibly fresh ingredients. will definitely be back next time I hit up Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, fun staff, wonderful service. I can't picture a better pizza place. Neapolitan style pizza. Be sure to try the grape and Gorgonzola salad.  Perfectly good wine selection.  We go almost weekly."}
{"text":"Consistently the best pizza, wine selection and salads in the Valley. I've been a regular customer for about 2 years now. Never disappointed and always amazed at the selections, service and special care taken to provide fresh products. The breads and pizza crust should be patented they are so remarkable!"}
{"text":"Very nice wood oven pizza.  Crispy thin crust!  Quaint, clean, cute restaurant.  Overall yummy pizza that I will return to!"}
{"text":"The best salads up in North Scottsdale area! Absolutely delicious & big portions. Their pizzas are amazing as well. Only complaint is that their prices are a little high... I suppose that is what you get when you go to a place who has to pay North Scottsdale's outrageous rent prices..."}
{"text":"Lamp pizza is great!  We went last night.   Our server,  Brooke, was so kind, clever,  knowledgeable and attentive!  The other servers and staff were very friendly as well.   We ordered white sangrias,  salads,  a recommended vegetarian pizza to split ( portabella mushroom, red sauce), and the salted caramel gelato... yum to all!  Sure we took most of the pizza home...but even delicious today.   This Chicago girl really recommends this pizza place."}
{"text":"Antipasto salad was delicious , GEM pizza was mediocre & service was very, very slow, if you're hungry, skip this place."}
{"text":"I went here earlier in the week for lunch and had a fantastic pizza- \"The Scientist\".  First off, the crust was excellent- no soggy middle like the ones they serve at Pomo.  The toppings- dry cured capocollo, sopressata Salami, and one other type of meat, along with green olives really made his pizza special.  The staff was great as well.  Just from talking to them, they obviously take a lot of pride in their pizza.    I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town hands down!  We start with the Union or Caesar salads,  which are fresh and excellent. (Homemade Caesar dressing... Yum! ) Everything is made in house, including the mouth watering meatballs! I order the Grandma pizza & my husband the Scientist.... Both of which are beyond delicious! Fresh ingredients, best crust ever & served piping hot. The staff is very friendly & attentive. Cleanliness is a definite priority, as are the ingredients & overall experience. Matt is truly the best pizzaiolo in the country!!! A must try!"}
{"text":"Have gone to LAMP Pizzeria now three times and each time have been just as satisfied as the last. They use quality ingredients, deliver a consistent service, very friendly staff and owner, and the atmosphere is very nice. Overall a very nice place with great quality pizza that tastes delicious.  My wife has enjoyed the salads, I have tasted several of their homemade soups and they are great, and we all love the pizza without question. The one thing which was strange to me was the addition of pecorino cheese to the traditional mozzarella cheese on the pizzas. The first time I had it their way and it was good, but since then we ask them to hold the pecorino for the kids as they prefer the more simple flavors as I think I do as well.  Either way it is a great place to go and you will not be disappointed. For us it will become a frequent stop when in the mood for a great pizza, true Neapolitan style."}
{"text":"Super Super food. Salad's were awesome ordered two and shared the Simple Salad and Tomato/Mozz.  Dinner had the Margherita Pizza and side of meat balls.  Both were super.  Too Bad the service was lacking on Friday 10/25 and it was not busy.  Server had to be reminded to fill water glasses, clear the table, and take drink order.  The manager in the red top was none better.  If you are a manager in the highly competitive area do you think she would go table to table to ask about the service....NO...It seemed that the regulars were her main focus.  Jetting around to get to her regulars.  It was her same MO with all of the other customers.  Reminded me of AppleBee's trying to turn tables..with no customers waiting..??  There are a lot of Italian places to eat off Pinnacle Peak and Pima...Nick's Pane E Vino next door.....also Pizza Hut, Little Caesers LOL. I would not recommend Lamp go to Nick's or Pane E Vino for the combo FOOD and SERVICE.  Too bad good food does not keep a place open. We will see in 8 months who will be in that location...Maybe Restaurant Rescue can give them a hand...I will not be back nor will I recommend it to anyone...and I know people..."}
{"text":"Lamp is one of my FAVORITE places to eat. Everything I have ever ordered on the menu was 10/10. Service is always great and the atmosphere is wonderful. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great pizza, apps and wine! The desserts are pretty great too ;)"}
{"text":"We are staying at hotel nearby with two young children, walked in on a Wednesday at 6:30 with no wait.  Immediately greeted and drink order taken, as well as appetizers and kids pizza.  Appetizers and kid's pizza came out within 10 minutes.  Once we finished appetizers, our pizzas came out, nicely timed so that my husband and I could enjoy our meal once our kids started eating.  The baby enjoyed the appetizer meatball, and our 3 yr old had a pepperoni pizza.  I had the delicious Kensington, and the hubby had the kicker. We sat outside as the weather was beautiful and it was quieter than inside, but interior was beautiful and I probably would have sat inside had I been with an adult only group.  We would definitely return next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is creative and stunning.  If you have one chance to impress and you know your party is a \"foody\"... this is a sure win.  The atmosphere is just about perfect.  Enjoy... and if you like it \"spicy\" ... get the Kicker."}
{"text":"Good pizza. They charge for bread!  Pedestrian, fast food decor. Horrendously noisy when full.."}
{"text":"This place really has some interesting appetizers and outstanding pizza also with amazing taste combos not commenly found on your traditional pie.  I agree with Kristin the Fig-Sambucca is simply outstanding.  The price, decor and layout of the restaurant is ok which holds them back from a 5 star however if you are looking for great pizza experience in North Scottsdale give this place a try you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great great pizza!  Love this place, eat here at least once a week. The crust is to die for, the toppings super interesting, great salads and appetizers.  Really everything is top notch."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Pizza in town. I tired a lot of them and have never been disappointed. The soup is one of my favorites especially in the winter. But hands down my favorite thing on the menu is the meatballs. Great place for a date night or bring the whole family."}
{"text":"This place is good, and for the North Scottsdale area a welcome higher end normal place to eat. It is no Pizzeria Bianco, but given the choices out here, I get the 5 star ratings. Being surrounded by either expensive or bad places (and sometimes both) raises your boat, sorta like being the smartest kid in special ed class. Don't get me wrong, good food, passable service, in a pleasant dining room at a cost that, while not a bargain, is not a rip off either."}
{"text":"Great staff and ambiance. Gorgonzola salad was delicious.  Grilled veggie pizza could have had a little more flavor.  Simple but good.  The scientist pizza was fabulous !!!  Update - We went back for more and thoroughly enjoyed the The Simple Margherita Finished with Wild Arugula and Shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Consistently great!"}
{"text":"I will go back for sure. The Pizza is amazing and I love the patio but....the service last night was beyond AWFUL. I will give it one more time or use their take out"}
{"text":"Nice concept.  They have an extensive menu of red and white pizzas and you can add toppings to either to create your own.  In addition, there's a lunch menu that also offers salads, meatballs, etc. The pizza is good and, because of their cooking method, it comes out quickly.  The crust is crispy but doughy underneath. Not too thin, not too thick.  OK spot. My only complaint is the price. $15 - $16 for a 10 to 12 inch pizza seems a bit steep but it is very good."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! It's become our favorite neighborhood place, and top choice to take out-of-town guests for casual chow. LAMP is also the only place this far north that's on par with California restaurants."}
{"text":"I am in love! In love with Lamp Pizzeria! Seriously! Not only is this the best restaurant in the area, it is the best pizza in AZ! The owner/chef is a genius when it comes to the art of making pizza! Everything here is delicious, from the soup, to salads and the appetizers. My favorite pizza is ever changing, but my two go to's are the kicker Jr. and the scientist. So damn good! Don't get pissy if there is a wait here during peak season. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"So went there with my better half to get some dinner on a Thursday night at 5pm and sat at a hi-top table by the bar. it was not busy only maybe five or six tables and two guys sitting at the bar.   The hostess told us that our server would be right with us. 5 Min later we were told the same thing again. When the server finally did come over it turned out that it was the bartender that was six feet in front of us the entire time. lol  He came over and he took our order and they guy had an attitude like the whole world revolved around him. What an jacka$%. We gave him our order and then we looked at each other and got up and left.  The thought of having to tip this guy for his crappy superior attitude was just not going to happen.   Hey Lamp, when I told others about what happened they knew exactly who I was talking about. One person even told me that they used to go to your cafe just so they would not have to have to deal with him.   So I guess then you must be ok with his sunny disposition.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"While it did take awhile before someone came to our table, once they did it was fantastic!  Great vareity of wood fired pizza, fresh salads and good wine selection.  Wish i could save room for toasted marshmallow  shake!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Love it from the moment you walk in. Decor is great and employees are super friendly. Our pizza was freshly made in about 5-10 minutes. Perfect for hungry boys at lunch! I got the \"Gem\" pizza. Very tasty. And we indulged in Toasted Marshmallow Milkshakes.....SO good!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas and salads. Friendly service. Great wine list for the price and value. Love this place"}
{"text":"New favorite spot for pizza in Troon. We used to frequent Rare Earth pizza but the crust at LAMP is definitely superior which is saying a lot. It has that slightly charred flavor that is so hard to find. Our server was James and he was awesome."}
{"text":"I am 1 for 2 at Lamp. The first time I went, I sat at the counter had quick service and great food. So, I decided to bring my wife and daughter with me and the encounter was less than memorable. Yes, the food was good, but the service was... really awful. It was 7:30 pm on a weekday night and a light crowd (save for a table of six nearby whose noise was deafening). With many empty tables, we were seated in the corner next to the restrooms and the rather loud diners who lingered long after the bill came. But, hey, that's their prerogative. The food was good but we were greeted by two servers--one plus a trainee. There were long gaps in service during which our apathetic servers vanished or chatted with other diners. Our salad order was delivered incorrectly and all of our food pretty much came at once. And then our service pair vanished again. My wife had to go to the front of the house to get a box and our bill as to not prolong our stay. Lamp is in a spot that has had quite a bit of turnover in a shopping center that resembles a modern day ghost town. I was pleased after my first visit to see a new, exciting dining establishment come to our neighborhood. They best fix their service issues or be the next in line to come and go from North Pima Road."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  I tried the Gem and the Gordon.  Both were really good.  I would recommend the Gem.  Its a red pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ricotta, oregano, and garlic.  Plenty of toppings and cooked with wood in a brick oven.  The crust was good but it was a bit burnt in spots.  I like crust to be made this way but this was a little more burnt than what I have been used to.    The only other issue was 16 for such a small pizza seemed a bit high.  But thats probably the reason they are in far No Scottsdale and Im not.    Other than that this is a very solid pizzeria to add to AZs amazing pizza list.  I swear you can get better pizza in this town than Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place blows Pizzeria Bianco away!!!! This is my favorite pizza, hands down!  The \"Grandma\" pizza is simple with provolone cheese and red onion, but is full of flavor and packed with just the right amount of spicy kick!  It will be your favorite too!  The salads are amazing!  Huge portions!  The eggplant appetizer is a must try as are the meatballs!   Please give this place a try, you will be thrilled you did!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a while, and that is saying a lot!  I picked up 3 pizzas to go and we loved them all - The Gem, the Simple and the Gepetto.  All unique tastes beautifully complemented each other.  While I didn't dine in, the atmosphere looked fun and upscale.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight.  The restaurant was full.  The atmosphere was inviting and warm.  The wait staff was very good and attentive.  The GEM pizza was excellent.  There were two problems. The beer glasses are never chilled there. The beer was cold but could have been colder.  The other problem was the spinach salad was room temperature, it was tasty but would have been better cool.,  I mentioned it to the waitress.  The two problems are why I gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Kensington pizza was very good, one of the better tasting pizzas I've had.  Coupled with a grape and gorgonzola salad and we walked out stuffed.  Will certainly be going back to try their other pies...!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite pizza place in the valley. The cap rear salad is different that any place and is the best cap rear that you can get. Can't go wrong with the scientist pizza. I wish they would open a second location near PV. Also since my wife is gluten free, would love if they added a gluten free crust option. Can't go wrong here though."}
{"text":"Ive owned a Pizzeria on Chicago's North Side for 16 years. When you make pie for a living, you dont pass out compliments to other people's pizza easily.  That said, LAMP Pizzeria is the real deal. Ive never been huge fan of Neapolitan but their crust was best ive ever had in this genre. Crispy with a crunch and chew. Tomato sauce could have used a little more zest but still good. Fresh mozz and meats were top notch.  Goat cheese and Fig bruschetta with almonds was money. As was the Arugula and White Bean Salad. Marinated Olives werent salty because they were top quality.  Hazelnut and Salted Caramel Gelato were 10 out of 10. The almond cookie with them is too sweet.  Nice comfortable space. Excellent service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I honestly would love to give this place 5 stars for their pizza, it's great, the rest of the experience however is not. I've eaten here on 4 different occasions, 3 carry out and 1 dine in. Dine in is terrible, takes forever to get food and drinks, and it's so loud that it gave me a headache. I have ordered carry out from then on simply because their food is good, unfortunately this experience isn't much better.   It takes HOURS to get your carryout order. The first time I ordered carryout I actually forgot what time it was and went about 20 minutes after I called only to be informed it would be another hour before my pizza was ready. Another time I went before the rush, as soon as they were open, that took 30 minutes. I called again today to try and order carryout only to be informed it would be 2 hours and 15 minutes before I could pick up, INSANE!"}
{"text":"Place is above average for an Italian joint.  It's kind of a Pizza Bianco knockoff with nice ambiance. They don't have any beers on draft, but the selection of bottled beer is good.  The wine selection is average, a notch up from what you would buy at Walgreens when the in-laws come to town.  The Antipasto Plate was tasty, however, the eggplant appetizer is small.  I haven't tried the pizza, but they have tons of toppings. The football game is usually on and they let me have the clicker to switch around to different games.  It's a good place to get drunk while my girlfriend gets her hair highlighted at the salon next door."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Gordon\" pizza.  Simply the best!  I love this pizza and will be going back again soon!  I ate the entire pizza.  Shhhh don't tell."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Scottsdale!  Prices are reasonable and the service is always fast.  It fills up quickly, but take-out is always a great option."}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob; I have probably been to 1000+ different pizza places throughout the US. For reasons unknown, the Phoenix Metro Area has a glut of phenomenal neopolitan-inspired wood fired pizzerias; of these, LAMP is my favorite. I may have been there in the right mood every time, but this pizza repeatedly exceeds my expectations. The quality is right on par with Phoenix's better known Pizzeria Bianco, and superior to anything I've had in California or New York."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! BEST PIZZA PLACE EVER!! Ordered take out last night and ate the leftovers for breakfast! The rough chop pesto that is part of the antipasto plate is AMAZING!! We tried the The Gem and it's now our favorite! Also tried the cream of broccoli, It was outstanding!!! The soup is always a must!!! Every time we eat here we have new favorites! This is the only pizza place we will eat at, period! Once again, my compliments to the chef, he is a culinary genius!"}
{"text":"So we come here and always sit at the bar every chance we get. James is a handful and usually very busy but one of the best parts of this wonderful restaurant. The pizza is great the wine good and again the take out server is amazing - so very lucky to have him - complicated and crazy but goes like a bat out of hell and does his job well. Some might hear him as short like Some I read - but they are STUPID and obviously not Owners that should know you can't make EVERYONE HAPPY. most of us are though."}
{"text":"If there was an option for 0 stars that would be the ranking. This was a disaster from the beginning. Walk in and there is a 15 minute wait. Ok, no prob. Well another party walks in 5 minutes after we do and they get seated in front of us. Wait, what? We ask about that and we get a \"oh, they called ahead to get seated'. Huh? Then we check and they don't have call ahead seating. Should have left right then but oh well we were already there. Strike one.   Service just down right sucked. The guy who was our waiter comes and says \"what do you want\". No Hi, no kind of acknowledgement. He was foreign so maybe bad service is typical in his country. Asked for refills several times and guess what, never got a one until we asked another waitress. Sad thing is that when looking around, all of the staff seemed to have a bad attitude. WTF? Don't they realize this is a tip kind of job?? Strike two.   Pizza was just down right bad. Soggy in the middle, burnt crust and basically no flavor. I have had better pizza at Pizza Hut, and that's bad. Whomever thinks that this is wonderful pizza really haven't had good pizza before or they are some of those terrible employees writing the reviews. Either way, pizza was terrible. Strike three.   This is the type of place you walk into in a good mood but you walk out pissed off. Believe me, that was reflected in the tip. Who decides this place is in the top 5 of North Scottsdale? They had to be smoking crack. There are many options in North Scottsdale but this will never be one for me. I don't know how they are still in business. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"We have ordered the pizza for take-out several times but will never go back after tonight.  The pizza is very nice but for carryout you have to deal with the barman who has the crappiest approach to customers!  He has a really surly and unpleasant attitude.  I have overlooked it in the past but tonight he had it dialed right up to full-on obnoxious.  Clearly he feels that his evening would be a lot more enjoyable if only the customers would go away. I'm happy to help with that.  Goodbye!"}
{"text":"Great little place for date night! LAMP Pizzeria definitely has the nicest \"fancy\" pizza in the Cave Creek/North Scottsdale area. It's wood fired and they use quality ingredients. Is it the best pizza I've every had, or even in the Top 5? No, but for the area, it's a fantastic choice and I definitely will be bringing family who visit here and going back for dinners with my husband.   The white wine sangria was fun and came full of fruit (grapes & oranges). I really liked the Grape & Gorgonzola salad because it was big, fresh, and filling. My husband and I split The Simple pizza and really liked it - good crust, good sauce, good cheese, good olive oil. Two drinks each, a salad, and a pizza runs about $50.  The place is cute. We sat outside, and though it's in a strip mall, the patio is in a courtyard setting with big string lights above. Wish they could get misters out there for the summer, but they have heat lamps for cooler nights. The courtyard faces west so you can see the sky change colors as the sun sets. The only bummer is that they don't have cocktails, but there is a place right next door that serves those."}
{"text":"Excellent wood fired pizza spot. I was in town for one day, this was a great choice. The Gem pizza is very very good.   Crust is very good, not as light and airy as I would like, a bit denser but delicious. Hot Calabrian oil on the side is a 10 though."}
{"text":"Something for everyone here!   Pizza lovers will enjoy the dozen red and white pizza selections.   Healthy eaters will love the white bean arugula and red onion salad and the mushroom soup, a flavorful broth with mushrooms and carrots.   And the desserts! Amaretto milkshake (to go they can't put in booze) and a at least 5 gelato choices.   The wine list is great and most comes by the glass.   AND the prices! So low!   Two can split a pizza for 15-16. The soup comes with two small pieces of their specialty flatbread and just 4 dollars.   Ricotta cheescake 7.   Everything here is cheaper than the SB equivalent, Olio Pizzeria, though to be fair, Olio Pizzeria (the bistro version of the fancy Olio e Limone, Julia Child's favorite Italian restaurant in SB) has more composed and sophisticated appetizers and also charcuterie.   But this is a GEM. Spectacular food, affordable good wine (you can pay 12/glass but most is in the 7 to 9 range and they have two choices for 6/glass), cute decor.   It's slow at night but I went at lunch this time on Black Friday. They do a big lunch business but the businesses were closed and everyone shopping so it was deserted.   If you live in Scottsdale, this should be on your list!"}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful. So cheerful and so so friendly.   We ordered the union salad and I was impressed with the freshness of the salad ingredients   The pizza was amazing. I loved The crispness of the crust. If you a deep dish pizza lover this is not the place for you"}
{"text":"Very nice place, quite modern.  Salads looked terrific.  I had the margarita pizza which was nice though not as great as Crust or Bianco, but better than Cibo.  And 10x closer than those.  The place just opened so give them time.  Dylan thought it was terrific.  Nice wine list.  Service was pretty good though it did take a while to get our order (again, it just opened so they're doing well considering)."}
{"text":"This place if very friendly and the pizza is amazing! Pizzeria Bianco look out!"}
{"text":"One of our local FAVES! My mom and her friend had a weekly standing date here to enjoy LAMP's pizza. I love their olive oil and bread and also the roasted vegetable salad is very filling and delicious"}
{"text":"Unique small great pizzeria . Excellent wood fired pizza . Very tasty and flavorful . Service is great. Love it. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"On a Friday night with nothing else going on, we decided to try a new place in our quest to find the best pizza in Phoenix.  LAMP is a little out of the way in North Scottsdale, but it looked good.  It was a little more crowded than I expected, and after 15 minutes or so, we were able to get a table.  LAMP is a mid sized venue with an upscale feel (the area is fairly insulated from any normal working class neighborhoods), with a very open food preparation area, as wood-fired pizza restaurants tend to be.  I went with the Gem (red pizza with sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, garlic, and oregano), and my friend had the Geppetto (white pizza with sausage, gorgonzola, and caramelized onion marmelade).  According to the menu, all of their sausage comes from the fantastic De Falco's Italian Deli in south Scottsdale.  The crust was excellent, and I really liked my pie.  Often when I get pepperoni on a pizza, the flavor overwhelms all the other ingredients and completely ruins it (I'm reminded of the terrible pie I had at LGO).  On this one, it was just right.  The sauce was delicious as well.  I tried the white pie, and I didn't like it as much.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't seem that special.  Also tried the ricotta cheesecake for dessert, and it was delectable.  I think I really like this concept of using ricotta instead of cream cheese.  Don't get me wrong, I like a good chunky New York cheesecake, but I guess the Italians do it better.  My biggest complaint about LAMP is the dining experience - the place does feel a bit cold and pretentious.  It probably goes with the North Scottsdale territory, but it lacks the welcoming air that Phoenix's smaller pizza restaurants enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is really close to our home.  We come here when we don't want to cook at home and don't want to drive far.  I had a couple of their pizzas and they are good, however, not enough that I would crave it.  I also like the Grape and Gorgonzola salad when I don't want to overload on carbs.  Sometimes service is a little slow, with twins I get a little nervous,  I try not to annoy other patrons, so sometimes I have my hubby order the food and I keep the twins in the car watching a movie for a little bit until it is almost time to have the food at the table,  this seems to be working for us, specially if the restaurant and the parking situation are close."}
{"text":"This place is a must!!! We have never tried anything we didn't like.   Say hello to James behind the bar, great customer service."}
{"text":"We tried two pizzas (the Gem and wood roasted mushroom) and felt that they were ok. We have been to numerous wood oven pizzerias as of late and this one was our least favorite. The pizza just tasted burnt and neither my husband nor I could overcome that.   We wanted to like this place because it is closer to us (compared to other options) but alas it was not to be. The other issue was the price which was a bit too steep considering that we didn't really love how it tasted.   Perhaps we will wait a bit and try it again but we are not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"We went on date night last night and it was amazing! He had the gem, I had the Kensington with no goat cheese. We are ever slice. I couldn't move all night after, but it was just that good. Food & drinks came out fast. You made this pregnant lady very happy!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Scottsdale. As good as pizzeria Bianco with parking.  I grew up in an Italian kitchen with grandparents that came off the boat from Italy-  this was the best meatball I've ever had. Sorry nana. I will absolutely be a regular at LAMP."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in town. Locally owned and operated. Great food, ambiance and service. Not to mention, the pizza could be and very well might be the best in town!  Stop in and see for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  Some of the best pizza in the Valley.  I am originally from NY and easily place Lamp aside some of the best Pizza places from the Northeast.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Walked in when they were crazy busy, sat at the bar and placed our order with the veteran bartender. Before I had finished my PBR they were boxing up our two pies. I think the secret to the fast and tasty pizza is their kick ass brick oven. I have to agree with the girl sitting at the bar, best pizza in Scottsdale period. The staff is soo friendly, even the dude making the pizzas screamed good bye to us as we left."}
{"text":"If you can get past the arrogant unprofessional unfriendly staff ...the pizza is very very good...the rest won't disappoint you"}
{"text":"This place has a great feel to it...comfortable and rustic.  The wood fired oven is quite a showpiece in red tile.  The pizza was delicious...we tried the Gem with sausage and pepperoni from DeFalco's, ricotta cheese and garlic - yummy!  The service was good too."}
{"text":"Great pizza  Very Very Busy but worth the wait  Wish they hadn't opened the lamp cafe next door I would prefer to see them have pizza at both places.   Yes the pizza is that good oh and the meatballs. Yummy"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!    We have had Meatballs, Mignulata (not to be missed), Three Crustini, Eggplant Parmigiana, Arugula and White Bean Salad, Margarita Pizza, Grilled Vegetable Pizza, Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake.    The one thing we did not like very much was the Ricotta Cheesecake.  It tasted like it was bought and spent too much time in the refrigerator.    My 7 and 5 year old loves the food and the old fashioned root beer (and the toasted marshmallow milkshake, of course).   I love the Simply Naked Unoaked Chardonnay, not too cold, perfect temperature.    My husband like a very cold Sierra Nevada.   We are here every other weekend.  I tend to over order so I can have lunch the next day.  Cold meatball sandwiches!  It's small, with miss matched chairs and beautiful warm lighting.  It's a great place for families.  I'm glad LAMP is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"First trip to LAMP Pizzeria this past Saturday night. My wife and I are big fans of gourmet pizza, and we had been hearing about LAMP in North Scottsdale. We managed to get a sitter, and make the trip from North Central Phoenix. We heard that LAMP was in the same center as Mastro's, and we were expecting it to be upscale,and maybe a little stuffy. We were pleasantly surprised to find a warm, friendly space, with a casually hip feel. We got a table by the patio, with a great view of the open kitchen area. We were greeted by a pleasant server who recommended a couple of excellent glasses of red wine. The menu was diverse, with some nice salads, and an intriguing selection of pizzas.. It had all the things we look for in a pizza, and we were especially pleased with the multiple choices of white pizzas. We ordered the grilled vegatable salad. It was a simple salad, with big chunks of grilled vegetables, and a good quality goat cheese. The dressing was a tangy vinigerette, that complimented the perfectly grilled veggies. We could have selected several of the pizzas, but we couldn't pass up the Wood Roasted Mushroom pizza. It was a beautiful white pizza, with large pieces of earthy, wild mushrooms. Garlic was the strongest flavor, but the cheeses held up nicely, and the overall flavor was terrific. The crust was just the way we like- thin, crispy and chewy, with slighly burnt edges.  I love eating left-over pizza the next day, and that is usually a good indicator of how good the pizza was. The pizza from LAMP was just as good the next day. We didn't get a chance to have a Nutella milk-shake with Frangelico, but we will the next time we are there. LAMP is a nice, casual-but-elegant spot, with terrific wood-fired pizzas. It's a long drive for us, but we'll go back."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place...never had a bad meal here. The salads are fabulous as well."}
{"text":"We took out of town family to this restaurant after reading grand reviews from Phoenix Magazine.  We waited 30 minutes for a table which can be understood because we didn't have reservations.  After being seated we waited another 30 minutes before they took our order.  After another 30 minutes we called our waiter over and asked the status of the food.  He assured us it wouldn't be more than another 10 minutes.  It was at least that.  We ordered a salad and 3 pizzas for 4 people.  The white pizza crust was so soggy, it was like eating raw dough so that went uneaten.  The other two were edible but still soggy crust-no crunch at all.  To top it all off, the hostess and the bartender were less than welcoming.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and if you do take out they put plastic webbing on the bottom of the pie to help keep it dry and not get soggy.  Perfectly cooked pies.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Came on wed at around 5:30pm. Place was pretty empty which I like. My lovely wife is out of town so I am solo tonight. Decided to try lamp pizza again since I have not been here for a long time and it is so close to where we live.   Wow. It has gotten even better. The appetizer were always the low point for me as I thought that there just were not enough with a variety of flavor. No more.  They have expanded the menu since I was last here. The variety is much better and the flavors are outstanding.  To start I had the:  Zucchini fritters.  Wow so amazing. Thin crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The light creamy dressing drizzled I've them was just the right contrast. The fritters themselves very deeply flavored and not one dimensional at all. So good.   Mulatala: just ok for me. The dough was thin and crispy but lacked seasoning. It is a bit bland. Even the sausage was under seasoned. I also think the portion is too big. I feel the Mulatala could be smaller and maybe more of then. The the sausage would it be lost in all the dough. The cauliflower is a much. Touch but why. It season the cauliflower first. It really didn't add anything to the dish.    I also had the olives. Spot on. Well seasoned and marinated.   I also had a pizza. Come on it's a pizza place. :) I had the:  L.P:  amazing. The crust was simply perfect. The right balance of char and crispy edges with a nice Neapolitan feel toward the center of the pie. The toppings for this were briny and delicious. I also asked for the piquant papers. Be sure to do this is you would like a mild sweet contract for this pizza. It is on the side so you add it as you like on top. Wow. Really provided a different taste for the pizza so goood.   I also recommend he Gepetto. To be honest, after 5+ more trips here recently, My wife and I far prefer the Gepetto. :)  For dessert the wonderful waiter I had, convinced me to try the toasted marshmallow milkshake. Boy I am glad he convinced me. Delicious. Deeply flavored with toasted marshmallow with litter chewy bits of marshmallow thought out. And the perfect size. I finished it all and did not feel over full after all The over food I had sampled.  Service has also improved. It was always good but not it is excellent. 5/5. Food 5/5. Overall 5/5. I can't wait for my beautiful partner of life to return so we can go together."}
{"text":"I went to LAMP tonight with a group of seven people for our last night in Scottsdale. We wanted something local and good and LAMP had great Yelp reviews.  We wavered between four and five stars but ultimately the service brought it down to four.  Our waitress really didn't check in with us regularly (my water was empty for a good 20 minutes and was only filled up when we called her over to ask).  That being said, the food was great.  We had the Zucchini Cakes as an appetizer and everyone at the table loved them.    We also ordered four pizzas to share:  the Gem, the Rasta, the Gordon and Stacey's Mom.  Each pizza has six pieces but some of those pieces are really big so it could feed more than six people.  The pizzas were well cooked and offered a nice variety. Two were red pies; two were white.  They had varying levels of spice and flavor but we really enjoyed them all.   Th restaurant is good for groups and is kid-friendly. We also really liked the pizza oven....it was covered in glossy red tile with white tiles spelling out the name of the restaurant.    Overall, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for pizza in Arizona and we have tried them all!  In addition to thin crust, wood-fired pizza, the salads, sauces and bread are outstanding. The owner mans the pizza oven and the wait staff is as top notch as the food."}
{"text":"Lamp Pizzeria serves wood fired pizzas, really nice salads, Sicilian Stuffed Bread and more. They have indoor seating and a small patio with umbrellas that's dog friendly.   We started by sharing the Union Salad. We received a very large salad with fresh romaine, sweet tomatoes, white beans, provolone cheese, toasted pine nuts and really delicious charred crusty bread.   Soon our pizza arrives. We tried the Grandma Pizza. It was a very thin but flavorful pizza that was charred just right. It was made with tomato, provolone cheese, onion, garlic and crushed chile. The crust was crispy and it got softer towards the center but not too wet. I liked that the pizza was flavorful, very light and didn't weigh me down.  One of the things that stood out to me was the perfection and technique of the char of the bread and the pizza. A another second or two I would have tasted burnt but the char I tasted was absolutely delicious!  Everything was very good. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Fast service. Wonderful pizza that you can tell they really care about what they serve you"}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza, good wines. I have to say this is now one of my top pizza places in Arizona, outstanding."}
{"text":"You gotta go! The pizza is delicious and the service is quick and easy. I have gone twice and gushed over my experience both times. I always recommend this spot! Go go go!"}
{"text":"It's a funny name for a pizzeria, but it's delicious!  Have been there a few times and ordered take out.  Service was good.  They have  Lamp cafe next door, both locations have a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Love this place, it is our new favorite pizza place. We have been 3 times in the last month. We get the zucchini cakes, the gem pizza and the antipasto salad. Kids get a white pizza and if they have been good the Smores shake. This is a family favorite where everyone leaves happy. One tip is the bar can be slow so if you plan on orderi g a second sangria, order it when they deliver your first. Love the red sangria."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday! Cute little place. Great pizza and good Italian wine selection. Would have been more enjoyable if we were not stuffed into a wall next to a party of 20 with screaming kids. Every time someone got up they ran into us. Service was pretty terrible and slow. Might have been due to being super busy. got a white pizza and a red. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and salad. Great for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"Good gourmet pizza for the area, but super busy!  I know that's a good sign, but the acoustics are so bad that it's like talking in a wind tunnel or something.  I wish they had a full bar :("}
{"text":"Excellent wood fired pizza! Although a little pricey (comes with the location, I'm sure), I am extremely pleased with the pizza. We got the Gem pizza; with spicy sausage, creamy ricotta and juicy pepperoni, I am not sure there's anything else on the menu that can beat it. The sangria is good and strong."}
{"text":"I almost hate to tell anyone about this because I want it all to myself.  The owner is a food artist.  The ingredients are of the utmost quality and the way they are paired is totally elegant.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  Try the Kensington pizza.  A white pizza with goat cheese, figs,arugula - add prosciutto - and you have it all.  Sweet, spicy, creamy, salty, bitter, chewy - really phenomenal.  They have Zucchini Cakes!  They have adult milkshakes!  They have great service!  They have a cool interior!  Better than Pizzeria Bianco.  There I said it."}
{"text":"A very solid pizzeria.  My patronage would be a lot more consistent if the Valley Neapolitan Pizza scene wasn't already firmly dominated by first movers, Pizzeria Bianco and Pomo.   Still, this place offers some subtle variations from the two that are worth trying...specifically the banana/nutella pizza."}
{"text":"Spinach salad was amazing full of flavor.  Had the gem pizza sausage very tasty. Every bite dance in my mouth."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, lived in Italy, and my family is originally from Brooklyn.  I feel that I've had some of the best pizza in the world.  My friend suggested LAMP.  I must say that most restaurants in AZ do not compare to those in Chicago, and certainly NYC, however, LAMP is an exception.  The crust is very good, the toppings are exceptional.  My favorite was the L.P., and instead of anchovies we opted for their Calabrese hot peppers.  I prefer not to eat pepperoni on pizza since most use the standard commercial sliced pepperoni stick, but this place uses a true southern pepperoni, which had a nice spice to it.  We also had the meatball appetizer, and my feedback to my friend was that the owner's recipe does not compare to my family's, and my family's recipe does not compare to the owner's - to each his own right.  We also had a fig & goat cheese bruschetta that was good, pretty rich in taste.  Order it if you really like goat cheese.  I will certainly suggest this locale to my parent's and will return upon my next visit to Scottsdale.  Buon Natale..."}
{"text":"We've been in the area for a few years now, and keep hearing about LAMP, how it is so good, and we've got to go, yada yada.  Not being big pizza people, (ok, do love it in Rome and at Punch in the Twin Cities) it took us years to get here.  Wow, everyone is right! DEE- LISH!!  Shared the zucchini cakes, union salad, and wood roasted mushroom pizza with the Mr Amy K. and we agreed that this was some kinda divine.   Still thinking about that mushroom pizza, will go back soon when it gets nice and hot and the crowds have diminished. Worth the long lines, though."}
{"text":"What a great spot!  I felt like I was driving to Canada, but that's only because LAMP is outside my usual 10 mile radius from Old Town.  Shannon M hooked us on to the zucchini cakes with basil aioli.  My husband didn't care for them, but he obviously has no sense because these were fantastic!  We chose the three crostini (white bean & roasted red pepper, ricotta, and pesto).  None stood out, and the flat bread was so chewy, it was hard to appreciate any of them.  We also ordered 2 pizzas because we have no concept of portion control.  My husband favored the Gem with both sausage and pepperoni and ricotta.  Too much meat for me.  I preferred the Gordon with capocollo, goat cheese, mushrooms, lots of garlic, and provolone.  Too much food to fit in a milkshake, but they have some very tempting options!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm and the noise was deafening. If you have hearing problems, it's not worth. Who wants to shout through your meal? The sound problem needs to be addressed. We enjoyed the  delicious spinach salad and our pizza was great.  Our waiter Jesse was very attentive and on top of things. We appreciated the flexibility to substitute ingredients on our pizza. We vowed to return only when going early, or if we can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Went for first time today..had lunch and it was great. I had some kind of white bean / sausage soup and it was pretty good..My girlfriend had some huge salad that she liked and the Red Pizza was better than I expected..actually, really fu**ing good! They were playing some good blues tunes that I liked..all in all a pretty good experience..I'll be back. Wait staff very good..don't want to forget them..very organized!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this zero stars, I would. We used to love this place but had the worst experience imaginable this weekend. I ordered pizza at 6:30 pm and he told me 25 minutes until it was ready to which I thought \"wow, that's quicker than usual\" and got there 35 minutes later and thought we were a little late. We got there to pick up and the bartender turned and said the pizza won't be ready until 8:30. We told him that he actually told us 25 minutes to which he said \"no, I didn't. 8:30.\" And turned the other way. We haven't ever seen such arrogant service. It would have been 100% okay to let us know it was going to be later than he thought. But to blatantly lie is another thing. We then spoke to the \"manager\" who was cooking in the back and couldn't be bothered with us. He said \"sorry call me tomorrow and I'll arrange something\" which was missing the point entirely. I don't want anything free, I want good service. I could pay triple for the price and not mind if the service was good. You don't ask for a manager and talk to them and leave with an even worse taste in your mouth than originally. All I wanted was for someone to say \"I'm sorry, we may have told you the wrong time. Is 8:30 ok?\" And I would have said yes in a heartbeat. I'm not an avid yelper or someone who complains but for a place my family and I used to love, it's disappointing."}
{"text":"After obsessively comparing reviews of Phoenix pizza restaurants, my husband and I decided to go to Lamp.  Great Decision!  The service was exceptional-our waiter was helpful without being overbearing.  I had the Geppetto pizza which was heavenly.  Carmelized onion marmelade?  Yum!  We're only in town for a week but will be visiting Lamp again before we leave!"}
{"text":"The competition for good pizza in the greater Phoenix area is pretty intense so one has to be on their game. We found Lamp to be lacking compared to the other numerous options available. Upon entering, we noticed the bar area is very small. So not a place for many to have a drink and pizza. When we ordered our pizza, our server informed us that it would be a bit longer than normal because they were busy and their pizza oven can only accommodate three pizzas! As a result, we waited about 45 mins for our order. The pizza was ok, but not worth that kinda wait."}
{"text":"Simply put... Amazing brick oven pizza. The sauce , the crust, everything. The gepetto with grilled onions, Gorgonzola and sausage is probably the one of the best pizzas I've had. It's rich and all the flavors are amazing. Get the marshmallow milkshake too!"}
{"text":"I've never written 1 review in my life. I go to Lamp a few times a month. The place is fantastic. Go early or go late it's very busy. If you go at 6 be prepared to wait and don't whine about the wait or the super busy staff."}
{"text":"We always LOVE eating at LAMP!! This restaurant really knows what they're doing, and I don't think we could ever get tired of their menu. The owners are so kind, and you can tell this is an excellently run family business. We love shopping & eating local, and this place makes it almost impossible to go anywhere else for pizza or salads!!"}
{"text":"although I haven't reviewed in quite a while, LAMP deserves some honor.  My wife and I were in Scottsdale for a concert and found this little wood fired pizza place, while looking for somewhere else. Man, an I glad that we couldn't find the other restaurant, because LAMP was great.  Its a pretty small place with the large pizza oven in the center.  It is a pretty amazing piece of equipment.  We chose to sat on the patio, which was also small, but very nice.  The place is super clean, the staff was great, and although busy, our server was quick and on top of it.  after looking over the menu, where everything sounded fantastic, we chose to go with zucchini cakes as an app and the Gordon as our pizza.  The zucchini cakes were delicious.  fried crispy on the edges and drizzled with an herby aioli.  the pizza was a white pizza, which had olive oil and garlic as the sauce, with a cured salami, goat cheese, provolone, spinach, and mushrooms.  It was, seriously, one of the best pizzas I have ever had...seriously.  I love the way the wood fired oven cooks the pizza, it was chewy and crispy at the same time.  It had some char from the high heat oven and everything was cooked perfectly.  I will def. go to LAMP again if ever in the area...heck, I might just make the drive from Northern AZ down, just for a slice of their pie again."}
{"text":"Just got back from Lamp. First time going there. The place is great. Clean, people that work there are nice and the food? Oh the food is wonderful. Grew up in Jersey and have lived in AZ 21 years. By far this is one of the best places I have ever been to eat. Had the Anti Pasta plate and the house Sangria to start. Both out of this world good. Ordered the Geppettos white pizza with black olives. Out of this world. Both of us could not finish everything and we brought home a large box. Have already recommended the place on my drive home. Most certainly going back many many times. Love it. You can't go wrong at Lamp wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"The ownership is top notch first rate - responded to an earlier review promptly and professionally. They listened and corrected the issue. Had a pizza party recently and was excellent!!! Get the shake."}
{"text":"We were expecting more. The pizza is good, but not great. The crust tastes more like New York style than Neapolitan style but the ingredients are more of the Classic Italian style.   The salad was enough to share easily.   Awesome gelato.   If it weren't for other outstanding options for Neapolitan in Phoenix this would suffice."}
{"text":"It was date night Wednesday...  Hubby and I wanted pizza, as usual I check my Yelp family to give me some ideas of the best places in my neighborhood.   Lamp had great reviews and it was down the block from our house so it was an ideal choice.    As we walked in an adorable hostess greeted us to let us know that we had a 25 minute wait, not bad for a busy Wednesday night.   As we sat on the wooden bench outside of Lamp enjoying the amazing night air...we heard our names being called....  Super excited I ran to the next available table. The menu was short and sweet with options for all pizza lovers.    Walking towards us was a gorgeous blond name Brooke with s smile of a 100 watt light bulb... She rattled off the specials and then gave us some great suggestion for our taste buds.    Listen I'm from NYC so you know I know PIZZA..... So this BETTER BE GOOD!!!   We ordered and the waiting began... waiting and waiting......  Okay so here is the deal if your starving this isn't the place for you. Each pizza is prepared from scratch and the oven only takes three pies at a time. So it took about 20-25 mins for the pizza to come out....but BOY it was worth it.   The crust was so crispy and light. I had spinach and my hubby had tomato basil....These pizza gave NYC PIZZA a run for its money!! It's difficult to say this but it's true.  This pizza pop and boom in my mouth....  We finished the night with a cup of super charged coffee. It was delicious and so smooth.   My Yelp family this place is a true gem.  I'm going to keep it real I have been looking for this kind of pizza since we moved out here and now it's just around the corner from me.....   They may need a restraining order to keep me away..!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend, otherwise I would have never thought to check it out. It's truly a hidden gem!!! Best pizza I've had in AZ and I'm a native! Plus, the patio is dog friendly!!"}
{"text":"The meatballs were great but the pizza was amazing!  It's one of my top 5 favorite pizza places in Arizona!  We want to try the soup next time.  The bread is delicious!  We had great service, too!  We will return!  Highly recommend this cute place!"}
{"text":"Wanted to get something close by after house hunting for the day and Yelp Near by and found this little gem!  Quiet, cozy and the wood burning pizza oven smelt devine.  Had a big salad and half and half pizza.  LOVED the thin wood fired crust!!!!  salad was  big and fresh.  Will defintely going back on our next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Love the pizza, milk shakes and salads.  I plan to dine at Lamp on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Was mostly disappointed here.  Had heard good things, but the pizza was mostly uninspiring.  The crust was bland... and too dense/hard/chewy.  I appreciate light and airy crusts and that was what I was expecting, but really nothing like it came through.  The fig appetizer was delicious, but otherwise not really worth the $$ I spent."}
{"text":"Uuummmmmm..........I've had some of the best pizza in the state of AZ!  THIS PLACE JUST TRUMPED THEM ALL!!!!!!!  So fresh, so high quality and cooked to perfection. I've only tried The Geppetto and it was MIND BLOWING. Soooooooo Goooood!  A toasted marshmallow milkshake for dessert is REQUIRED!  Class dismissed!"}
{"text":"i enjoyed the pizza here.  Wood burning stove. They need to add grilled chicken to the menu though. The waiter attemptes to get us chicken from the salad side but I think he forgot."}
{"text":"What a gem! I wanted delivery and they didn't offer it. I saw the five star rating and thought what the heck lets go see what this is all about. The service was off the chart in excellence. The food was even better.A very pleasant surprise across the board. Don't miss the experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place and would agree with other reviewers that it is solid wood fired pizza. Enjoyed the zucchini cakes and the gem pizza. Lots of delicious sounding options on the menu (hard to decide!) and my husband approved of the beer list. Very friendly service from both the hostess and waiter."}
{"text":"Came here after a Frank Lloyd Wright Taliesin West tour because it was kind of close. Thrillest Phoenix had this place on their \"Top 10 Pizza Places in Phoenix\" so I figured it'd be good.  AND IT WAS. I'm pretty sure our waiter's name was Cole and he was really awesome. Brought out an extra plate because I had mentioned wanting to split the pizza with my dad. Also gave recommendations to my mom who wasn't sure what to order. He even offered to split the check (I was with extended family members).  Short version: Great Neapolitan style pizza!"}
{"text":"Baller Pizza. Don't let them sit you in the corner though."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the pizza here. Definitely one of the best brick oven pizzas I've had in Scottsdale! Even though it was very crowded when we dined there, the staff was as helpful as possible. Had the Wood Roasted Vegetable and the Scientist and both were outstanding, I could not stop eating them. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Apps were good.  Pizza was just so so.  A little bland .. :("}
{"text":"Same good pizza, love the gem!! I think the guy that works the bar has a few himself. but really, good food good service and if you don't want anyone to see you, you can call your order in and they are pretty fast"}
{"text":"Tried to call in a carry out order many times here and it is a total joke. The phone goes into a recording, and when someone does answer, you get cut off. Too bad because the pizza is good.  When we eat in, service is hit or miss. The only time that they can give you good service is when the place is empty. This place is completely unorganized. I have to say that is is the worst operated pizza place I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Excellent pizzan and salads!!! So fresh and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality :)  great crust!"}
{"text":"Don't go if you are hungry because they are so slow you will be starving by the time you get your food. 45 minutes from order to delivery of our pizza to our table.  I think it was good pizza but we were so hungry we were ready to eat the napkins. Anything would have tasted good."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Tuscany / Lazio pizzas, and this place comes pretty close to recreating it. If you eat dominos or barros, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The pictures on the website for the \"Gem pizza\" are quite deceiving. Our pizza had less than half the toppings than the pictures show.  The crust might as well have been a flatbread as it was hard and tough to chew through. All this for $17.00 WOW!!!  My husband ordered a glass of wine which came in a small 'juice' glass....really? They only charged $10.00 for that!!! At these prices I would think that they could afford wine glasses? I saw they had champagne glasses at another table :(   If you really want good food I would look elsewhere.) Last time to go here. Cannot recommend. Diogorno Tastes better with more toppings!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Dear lord! So our company had its Christmas luncheon here last Friday, So glad I got to have this pizza again!   The restaurant itself is small and narrow but very cute and was able to accommodate our group of 12.   For a starter I got the meatballs, and had offered to share them with the people sitting around me. I wish I hadn't, they were Soho tasty!   For a pizza I ordered the Gem and had them add some green olives to it. AMAZING!   MY bosses wife ordered the Kensington and offered to let me try it. I normally don't like white pizza, but it looked interesting with the arugula piled high on it. But ones I bit into it I had a food gasam in my mouth! Under the arugula was FIGS!!! Seriously people, who puts figs on a pizza???? Lamp does, and thank god they do because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I took the last bite! I will FOR SURE be making the 40+ drive up to this place from my house and dragging my husband along as he HAS to try this pizza!!! Just amazing!"}
{"text":"Friend been telling me about this place for a while up where he lives says its like Bianco.  Like Bianco you know I have to try this place. Had the Kicker Pizza he liked it so much we ordered two.  Let me tell you it was GREAT. The chilies were the perfect heat with all the other flavors going on.  The Beer Prices are very good to.   Already been back before I wrote this review."}
{"text":"This place is consistent with food & always excellent service. My newest fav pizza is the geppetto. I still always get the eggplant as a starter, I am obsessed. This place is great, go early because it's small & the wait can be rough when busy."}
{"text":"I love Lamp.  I'm thrilled that it's in my neck of the woods too!  This is such a great place for 'upscale pizza.'  It's delicious, the service is super friendly and warm, and it's always high on my list of weekly places to spend our dining out dollars.  We love to dine-in, enjoy a bottle of wine and wait for our wood-fired pizza!  We love Lamp!"}
{"text":"Ok we loved it.  Upsides: Chewy crust. The white sausage pizza had Carmelized onion relish....perfectly sweet balance. (and I dislike sausage pizza). The white mushroom was also great...lots of fresh mushrooms! Zucchini cakes TO DIE FOR. Also, fig and goat cheese with mint bruschetta was fab. We also LOVED the white beam arugula salad. Frankly, there was nothing we didn't really enjoy. Great pizza for those of us too far north to drive to Bianco.  Also, we had great service.   Downsides: it's loud in there. They tried to seat us back by bathroom, it was too loud so we moved up front for a slightly better sound situation.  Rugs or some sort of sound barrier would help a lot. Also, we were one of a few tables but waited a long time. So long they brought an extra bruschetta (very nice of them!)."}
{"text":"I'm from the East coast and it's hard to get a good pizza in AZ.  The pizzas at Lamp have fresh ingredients (basil, vegetables, meat, ricotta or mozzarella cheese) and the crust was thin.  Service was great and waitress was friendly and attentive.  Loved the pizza we had for late lunch and would go back for the dinner menu.  Have been to the Lamp Cafe next door and LOVE their salads!"}
{"text":"ORDER: Mignulata for an appetizer (Sicilian Stuffed Bread) AND Geppetto (White pizza with sausage, gorgonzola & caramelized onion marmalade! Oh Em Gee! We substituted the cheese on the geppetto for ricotta and it was great! These two items on the menu are phenomenal! I won't branch out and try anything else! I had the ricotta cheesecake. It needed more citrus to cut the thickness of the cake. Next time I'll ask for more oranges. Go here, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We love LAMP Pizzeria -  What a little gem in North Scottsdale.  We started with Italian glass of wine, ordered white bean and arugula salad (added some Proscuitto to the salad) and had side of their appetizer meatballs.  I'm Italian girl making meatballs the old fashion way for 30 years - OK...they were just like mine - Perfect.  The pizzia has the best crust and toppings - We have been back several times and are very happy every visit.  The wait staff is very friendly, but the best was the Owner, Lindsay took the time to talk to us and now knows us - so it is our new and most favorite place to go for salad, appetizers, and of course their amazing Pizza.  Lindsay's husband Matt makes the incredible Pizza.  Try it and you will be back."}
{"text":"When eating pizza, my girlfriend and I see absolutely no location as being off limits. I recently reviewed a nearby pizzeria and harshly criticized its pizza quality, declaring it as nothing more than a neighborhood restaurant whose praise stems mostly from the fact that there are no other options available in the area to compare it against.  In some ways, I expected similar things from Lamp Pizzeria. It's located off the beaten path, with a clientele that most likely consists of neighborhood locals. When I research pizza in Phoenix, Lamp is rarely mentioned or brought up as one of the premier \"hot spots\" for good pies. And honestly, I consider the term \"hidden gem\" to be one of the most overused terms in Yelp reviews. But this is one instance where I feel it just fits perfectly.  Lamp is a wood-fired pizzeria, very similar to the variety of well-known spots you'd find further south. And someway, somehow, Lamp manages to do things just as good, and even in some instances, actually better than some of these places.  My girlfriend and I have visited Lamp a handful of times over the last several years and have always been incredibly pleased with the results. Unlike one reviewer, who criticizes the \"nook\" table that's next to the restroom, we actually requested it during our most recent outing. I love the seclusion and privacy it provides. No, you can't see or hear anything that's happening in the restroom. In fact, I posted a picture of a seating area that I feel would be much, much more offensive to people that are picky about \"restroom distance.\"  For starters, they offer a great fig and goat cheese bruchetta, as well as some decent zucchini cakes. The cakes have a crispy texture, very similar to what you'd find in a farinata. Additionally, their traditional bread offers up some surprisingly great flavor, making it an essential starter. Six dollars for olives is a bit silly, however, especially since they're complimentary at many other places. The ideal starter, however, is their mignulata, which is Sicilian bread stuffed with cauliflower, pecorino, and sausage.   One Yelp reviewer mentioned that they allow you to mix and match your pizzas. Keep in mind, this is only true in certain cases. Your reds will allow you a bit more flexibility in this area, whereas a white pizza like the Kensington requires you to order it whole due to the ingredients used. In fact, the Kensington is probably the best out of all of their creations, provided you're willing to pay for the prosciutto up-charge.   There's also an excellent Calabrian oil that you can order as a side. Be warned, however, that the spice in this is definitely not subtle. It hits your palette like a heel wrestler's chair-shot to the head. Pow! It works well on red pizzas, but again, up-charging for oil in a restaurant is the equivalent of charging for ketchup. But whatever.  Sticking with the positives, as I've said many times, it doesn't matter what you put on the pizza. If your crust sucks - your pizza sucks. And thankfully, Lamp knows what it's doing in this regard. Slightly charred with our preferred crunchy shell and moist interior, there's plenty of flavor packed in here. The Bianco influence is obvious.  For desserts, Lamp offers up a so-so ricotta cheesecake, some excellent shakes, and spectacular gelato - with their sea salt being our personal favorite. Their moist amaretti cookies (included with gelato) are so good that they can easily stand on their own as a respectable dessert.  Overall, this is probably one of the best examples of how a neighborhood pizzeria should operate. With great pizza, respectable starters, and some wonderfully simplistic dessert choices, you really can't go wrong.  It's a good 30-40 minute drive from my house - but as long as they keep doing things the way they're doing, we'll gladly make the occasional trip to Lamp to enjoy their delicious offerings.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful place for Pizza, fantastic salads, wine, beer.... the best pizza in Scottsdale by far.  Had to give it 4 stars because we went with a group and the waiter didn't tell us the tip was included so they walked away with a 44% tip... we should have known to look for this, however the Waiter knew as they had to add it on and should have said the tip is included....  The kicker and the Gem are our favorites and the Milkshakes are awesome (they even have adult milkshakes!)....  I am hopeful they fix the tipping issue as it is customary to tell the party that you have tacked on the tip!"}
{"text":"My friend and I found this little gem on yelp! East coasters rejoice! Finally a pizza place that reminds us of home. We started our meal, the grape and Gorgonzola salad, it was crisp and fresh. Totally delicious. Ironically enough we got \"The Gem\" which has fresh ricotta, sausage and pepperoni! This pizza was perfect! I couldn't find any reason not to give this place five stars. Side note they accommodated us so we could watch the NBA finals!"}
{"text":"LAMP is great restaurant all around.  The food is awesome, the atmosphere is lively and the wine is fantastic.  The pizza is some of the best pizza we have had.  It is very comparable to the pizza we get while visiting family in Italy."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. The pizza oven as the feature of the restaurant is very cool. But it all went downhill from there.  The staff were too busy shinning glasses to bother serving us and when they did finally get around to us they weren't all that helpful.   We ordered 3 different pizzas, we all liked the style but the flavor just wasn't there. They were sloppy and just blah.   Wine list was shocking also, so bad we didn't even order any and just stuck with water."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best brick oven pizza's in Phoenix & it has the taste of  love all through it. The drive is a hike for me to get there (35 miles each way) however worth the time.  The bartender was fantastic!  Knows his stuff, every bite he recommended was on point and we never had to ask for a thing. And he was hammered with to go orders, bar customers, and the whole house of drink orders from the wait staff.  Truly a guy that knows how to run a bar!  Hard to find an over the top pizza and good service packaged so perfect. Top 2-3 Place in town!  I'm a pizza foodie and will be back. . . Even with the long drive I will become a regular!  This place has it all in Point!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times, the red sangria is awesome.  The spinach salad was perfect, and their pizza's are great.  Will definitely be back again.  The service is fast and very friendly staff.  They really seem to care about the customer."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and salad. Pizza was crispy with fresh ingredients. Salad was large and had big chunks of shaved cheese. Good prices. Sangria was also very good. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in town! Salads are good too. Very busy so call early for take-out."}
{"text":"I love Lamp Pizza. You cannot get a wood fired pizza like this in town. The \"marginara\" pizza we get is off the charts delicious. Their sauce and mozzarella is always fresh, and all of their employees are nice. The salads are also good, but a bit on the pricey side as well as the pizzas. My favorite pizza place in all of AZ by far! YUM"}
{"text":"What happened to LAMP? Our recent visit was for a takeout salad and pizza.  The salad (arugula & bean) was good as usual, but the pizza (picked up on time and taken right home) was ice cold and the center of the crust was very soggy, yuck.  I tried to revive it in the oven but the outer crust had already been charred too much so it really didn't work out.   Also, my wife has complained of their roasted veg salad being way overcooked the last few times and now she has stopped ordering it. Lastly, did their pizzas get smaller?  Ever since they changed their pizza offerings, it seems they are now slightly smaller.  Hmmm. Too bad as we used to really like this place, having been there a couple of dozen times.  We will look for something else for a while and hope they get back on track."}
{"text":"It is always a pleasure to find a nice new restaurant up near Pinnacle Peak. We tried LAMP, and we were thoroughly satisfied!  The margherita with crimini mushrooms and sausage was excellent, and the grape/gorgonzola/pine nut salad was generous with a very tasty vinaigrette.  The staff were very attentive and it's obvious they care about their customers, their product and presentation. We're going back soon!  Give it a try. This is a tough area to make a small restaurant profitable, and we want to see this one stay a while!"}
{"text":"Good experience, good food, good crowd on a Tuesday night. This is the place where locals go! James provided great service and great recommendations. Enjoyed the white pizza with sausage and a nice glass of red blend wine from Australia. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"My finance and I are pizza obsessed and have tried nearly every place around. This is probably our new favorite !!! We can't wait to coke again. Simply amazing"}
{"text":"OK this is a pizza place and a welcome addition to the North North Scottsdale culinary scene.  The salads are huge.... and tasty - perfectly dressed. The pizzas are terrific - the Gem and the Sargent are great. We tried the Gepetto the first time we were here...normally, I'm not a fan of white pizza, but it was excellent. Servers are a bit funky...the first night we were here, our server (who also works at X-Tapa Joes) was awesome. Last night, our server was just a little odd...but I couldn't fault the timely service and attention. Overall, a stellar experience.... Note that they only take reservations if your party has more than 6 in it."}
{"text":"Come on! This place is ridiculous!  I used to work at a country club right down the street and spent many an exhausted all-too-short break at the nearby Starbucks. I always thought Lamp's signage was cute and put it on my mental list of places to try.  Last night we decided to try some place new for our *1**year**anniversary* (Aw, a year ago we went on our first date and he thought I hated him the whole time) and Lamp was it. The menu looked tasty...but nothing could prepare me for the ...  CROSTINI. You must get this. You must. Toasty bread (next time I'll ask for a bit more char...I love grill marks on my bread! More flavah!) and onion/cheese-adorned flatbread wedges served along a trio of dips: Herbed Ricotta, White Bean/Roasted Red Pepper and (be still my heart) Rough Chop Pesto. The RCP was a flavor explosion of whole toasted pinenuts, fresh basil (in December? I like AZ), garlic, parm and magic. The herbed ricotta (It looked like a lil scoop of vanilla ice cream!) was a bit bland BUT, when combined with the RCP, it popped! The white bean/roasted red pep stood on it's own as well. This is one of my favorite appetizers of all time, hands down.  But what about the main event, the pizza? Two words: HOLY SAUCE. Both our pies were red sauced (Need to try the white pizza next time!) and it was pretty much a religious experience for me. Sauce was lightly done, as to not overpower anything, but it was SO fresh and homemade tasting. The Grandma had red chiles, onion and provolone (to die) and The Simple was a margherita topped with MOUNDS of arugula and fresh parm shavings with a sprinkling of extra virgin. They were both EXCELLENT.  Our server was sweet and kind of spastic, as we saw her run into about 3-4 tables, chairs, diners, etc. It was kind of funny.   Lamp is absolutely a new go-to! I LOVE LAMP! (Several years late, really cool reference points for me)"}
{"text":"Love the wood fired pies here. They have a lovely selection of regular and white pizza. The salads are very nice as well. The atmosphere is nice with the pizza oven as the center piece. Try the kicker, vegtable and white pizze. The wine selection is nice. Ricotta cheesecake is  light and flavorful.  There are many pizzarias in the valley. This is right up there for quality."}
{"text":"Best pizza North of Cactus.  I can truly say that after eating more pizza than anyone over the last 50 years.  Meat balls are excellent too.  If you order food to be taken out on Friday.at 5pm expect to wait 1 hour 45 minutes so call early."}
{"text":"First time. Went for lunch. Very clean. Friendly host. Friendly server, Brook. I had the grape & Gorgonzola salad. It was delish! Fresh. Huge. Rich in flavor and texture. It comes w bread that was AMAZING. I only had a couple bites because I wanted to try the pizza. The crust was chewy in the best way possible. The pie itself could have used a pop of garlic or basil flavor to make it stand out. The service was awesome. Bathrooms very clean. Cool atmosphere. I bought a gift certificate for a friend. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"What can I say I'm a fan for good pizza.  I've been here twice now and both times I've been sat next to the restroom.  I don't usually mind it, but this place is small and the table setup isn't that spacious.  Sitting next within 5 feet of the restroom door you'll get a nice odor of urinal cake as a reminder.    Service was great though.  The sangria was tasting, but the caesar salad had too much anchovies in the dressing.  Still editable, but not your regular caesar.  The pizza!  We ordered the pepperoni and the kicker.  Both excellent choices, but one with a kick!  As you guessed the kicker had a nice spicy flavor.  Spicy Calabrian Peppers & Hot Calabrese Salami.    For dessert we order a Nutella Milkshake and a Amaretti Cookie Milkshake,  Both excellant!  For the price I think it's ok, but try not to get seated near the restroom."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town and the best food north of Bell road.  Everything is sooo yummy; no bad choices.  I moved back to AZ from LA a few months ago and my family is so grateful to have found Lamp. In addition to the food, the service is great. The staff get to know you and treat you like old friends. If you come here you will not be disappointed.  Also don't be turned off by the timing. Everything is worth it. Whatever time they quote you is 100% accurate; they have it down to a science.  Again, everything is worth it."}
{"text":"Good pizza, similar to pizzeria Bianco. Turns out my crust was a bit too gluteny chewy. Otherwise, delicious wood fired pizza"}
{"text":"Check out this popular Pizzaria. Lamp is popular for a reason and one  of many is the spectacular thick deep mushroom pizza, and others! It's small and busy! It's our favorite since leaving Chicago to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place is by far, the BEST pizza I've ever had! It gets crowded but the service is great and they own the restaurant right next door (more of a Happy Hour Pizza Place) where you can hang out until they call your cell and tell you that your table is ready. Salads are BIG and delicious too. I had the Caesar Salad. We also had Pepperoni Pizza and a Veggie Pizza. Yum, yum yum!!!!!! Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite pizza spot in the valley. I've been coming here over the past 4 years and each time, without fail, is the best pizza I've had. Matt and his staff know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. I've tried many items on the menu, including apps, pizza, salads and desserts. They are all fantastic. This is the best pizza in town hands down!! Pizzeria Bianco who?"}
{"text":"This is wood oven fired pizza at it's BEST!  The dough was thin, crispy and yet obtained a slight doughy chew, with a bubbly, gorgeous crust. The dough, in an of itself, was the perfect combination of textures and taste. The toppings on the pizza were flavorful and unique. We ordered the \"Sidekick\" pizza and Spinach salad. The Salad was super fresh with a high quality extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinagrette, which could stand alone on their own merit.  Adding extra levels of deliciousness, the salad also included fresh orange slices, pine nuts and goat cheese, as well as two fresh pieces of italian bread. My husband, who is not a salad fan, said he would gladly eat salad every day if it tasted this good. Every aspect of our meal was composed of fresh, high quality ingredients that were perfectly balanced together!  We can not wait to come back and try more dishes!  Our waiter was very friendly, professional and attentive, also.  Across the courtyard from LAMP Pizzeria, is LAMP CAFE, which we can not wait to try.  The menu and decor there, looked very appealing, as well."}
{"text":"Have gone several times for pick up and have decided not to go back. Food is delicious but the wait times are just ridiculous, maybe invest in another pizza oven? Making your customer wait 2 hours and then telling them it's going to be an additional 30 minutes when they go pick it up is just crazy. The staff aren't friendly, particularly the bar tender. Won't be back, plenty of good pizza around here without dealing with this crap."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Love every bit of it. The soup is a great appetizer, as well as the Cesar salad. We got 4 pizzas, the Gem, the scientist, the Marghinara and a Margherita pizza. All were delicious. Would recommend this pizza place over any other in Arizona. The wood baked oven for all to see while eating is also really cool."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and salads here! My 10 year old is a big fan too - the style of pizza, variety of ingredients and toppings, quality and taste - all get two thumbs up! The guy behind the bar that also helps with takeout orders is awesome - super friendly and helpful. Try to avoid the peak dinner times and be prepared for a bit of a wait when all the snowbirds are in town. Snowbirds... lol. They love this place."}
{"text":"The menu looks appealing. Getting \"The Gem\" red pizza today. Looks like there are14 reds and 7 or 8 white pizzas. The restaurant is small and the staff is very friendly. They have a wood fired stove that the owner works and really do a great pizza."}
{"text":"A friend of the family recommended this place so we decided to check it out.   When the 7 of us arrived the restaurant was almost entirely full (it's not very large in there; I would suggest making reservations for larger groups). They apologized and said they didn't have the space and there would be a wait.  Luckily, a table had just stood up to leave and they were able to push a couple tables together to accommodate us.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered five different kinds of pizza. Three of which I tried; \"The Scientist\", \"Geppetto\" and \"Wood Roasted Mushroom\". By far the Geppetto was my favorite. I also enjoyed the large fresh mushrooms on the Wood Roasted Mushroom Pizza. The crust was a little too burnt for my taste (I pulled the crust off to get ready for swim suit season anyway!) but otherwise the pizza was delicious. We had assumed we would take some left overs home but it was so good we ate everything that came of out their wood fire (which you can see from almost anywhere in the restaurant).  Overall it was very good and I think I will go back with just my husband to have an easy date night!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Lamp at 7:30,  we ordered at 7:40,  our pizza's arrived at  8:45.  Who goes to a pizza joint to wait over an hour for food?  As usual fairly brusk service and no reason for the wait.  If you want to wait over an hour for an expensive pizza, less than average service and the smallest wine pour in Scottsdale go to Lamp.  Two pizzas, and a few drinks at over $85 is not my idea of a pizza night out.  Go at your own risk and time."}
{"text":"A very solid pizza and salad joint with good service and a nice ambiance.  Check it out, your will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Lamp Pizzeria for the first time this week and can't wait to go back. Had the meatballs to start and was blown away. They were incredible!  The pizza too, was awesome. Everything is fresh and even their Sicilian sausage was homemade!  The crust is perfect as only a wood fired crust can be. The salads are large and couldn't be fresher. So many to choose from too. Matt, the owner and pizza maker is right on with one. His hard work and research on each meal he puts out really shows. Our waiter, Zack truly made our experience at Lamp a great one. He answered our questions, made suggestions and had a great personality. There are so many items on the menu that I want to try that, as I said, I can't wait to go back and bring family and friends too. Keep up the good work. This is a winner!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and was visiting my family. This place is now my favorite over anything I've tried back home. Bravo~"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Great option for lunch and dinner. Appetizers are unique and quite tasty. Same simple salad from next door. Sea Salt and Carmel gelato is a must. Lamp pizza and Lamp cafe are as close to Italy as you're going to get without crossing the pond. A++"}
{"text":"By far the coziest restaurant in North Scottsdale, with food and service to match. The owner and staff are little gems. I have tried many of their pizzas and all of them beyond satisfied my taste buds.  I am very impressed by Lamp Pizzeria and have no doubt that they will be very successful. It is the personality of the owner that shines through the great flavorful food.  Yes, I am somewhat addicted to this place but it's easy to understand why and I am confident that it will become one of your favorite restaurants to savor a delicious artisan pizza.  You also must try the mignulata. one of the best appetizers I have ever had. I will not describe it here, just go and have some!"}
{"text":"Wood fired pizza with meats from Defalcos, what more could you possibly want?   With my ancestors from Calabria, my heart, along with my taste buds, were warmed by the Kicker, which features Calabrian salami and hot oil. The Nutella shake as a desert was also a nice European-styled touch! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pom Pom....very good.  Crust was perfect on the outside but a little soggy in the center of the pie...not too bad though.  My favorite part was the salad...the basic salad...can't remember the name.  It reminded me of the homemade salad you would get in South Philly.  Service was excellent....our server Nick was very nice and attentive.  And kudos to LAMP for offering GOOD (Clausthaler) non-alcoholic beer.  It is nice to have that choice when you want to have beer with your pizza but you have to drive home.  My only negatives are the the noise level and the LOUD bartender.  Hard to have a conversation with your companions.  Will I be back?  Of course!  I need more of that salad!"}
{"text":"If, for some reason, you'd like to order a pizza with figs on it, but find yourself deathly afraid to take the leap, I recommend the Kensington.  Let's just say I've had a few billion variations of fig pizza in my day (I'll explain later/never.) Anyway, LAMP's Kensington was like fig 'n' goat cheese for  newbs - mostly mozzarella, blessed with a couple speckles of weak goat cheese and bits of fig. The crust was decent, but not memorable. Aside from arugula, I was yearning for more flavor than I got.   It think there's a lot of potential, but 'm not rushing back any time soon unless I can get about 5x the toppings and flavor, squared."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Gem! Don't eat pizza very often but when we do we come to  Lamp pizzeria!!! Excellent salads and pizza from the wood-burning oven's.  Fresh, fresh, fresh!! Always busy !! Usually sit in the bar area with James the bartender who is  always entertaining.   However a full  restaurant last night we were dining at the bar area. We would have stayed longer for another glass of wine  but with the sweat dripping down our backs ...we had to go. Can someone please turn the AC up in there?!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm going to say this. I think the salami and olive pizza I just ate might be the best ever. Wow!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Most of the time my husband and I grab food for take out after work and they are awesome. Love their pizza and salad selection. Tried different types and they are all good. Glad they are located by our house."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  A little bigger than a personal pizza but definitely not a medium sized pizza.  Price being $12 to $16 for 2 or 3 ingredients.  Wood oven, everything fresh and tasty, just a little pricey, but it's Scottsdale, in the same shopping center as Mastro's.  There is a zucchini cake appetizer that is a must have. It is three zucchini cakes that are similar to crab cakes.  The flavors and textures are perfect. We had a large Caesar salad which was easily large enough to split. Excellent service. Didn't give it five stars because it is a tad pricey for the pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My friend Bill told me they had the best pizza and he was right.  Wow - I don't know what it is - their oven or the ingredients, but I've tried almost all their pizzas now and each one is just ridiculously good!  I can't comment on the other food....since I can't get past their pizza and a glass or two of wine to go with it.  The people are friendly and it's really nice looking inside.  A good date spot I think, and cool for families too.  I don't want to overstate it, but their pizza is so good - if you eat pizza somewhere else you feel guilty.  Thanks LAMP Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Yum yum! What else is their to say that everyone else hasnt said about this place. I'm probably the biggest pizza fanatic in phoenix - it's literally all I eat, every meal.   Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Molto Bene!  My hubby and I enjoyed lunch at this fun find over the holidays.  I was surprised at how packed this place was considering obligations of the holidays.  We fell for the reviews and supped on the Gem-topped with the perfect amount of ingredients so as to keep it light and crispy-and the Grape and Gorgonzola Salad-a refreshing pairing.  The only downside was the gorgonzola was very mild-almost seeming like a goat cheese.  I love a strong, creamy gorg-and this was not the case. Oh well-everything else was just what my appetite desired."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.. it just I waited for another 15 to mins because they mess up my pizza. The waitress said they made a whole on my pizza...  I still want to give them 5 stars because of the owners. They responded to me right away when they learned about the issue. I have to give them credit for the excellent care and attention they give to their  customers. Thank you!.."}
{"text":"Decent pizzeria nearby.  It won't necessarily be in high rotation, but the atmosphere was nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today and liked it pretty well. The pizza was very good. We also had a toasted marshmallow milkshake and a tomato basil mozzarella salad. The Salad was not what I was expecting, but I liked it a lot. We customized our pizza order and they did half and half for us, which was nice. the crust was delicious. They could have been more generous with the mushrooms and olives but I could tell the ingredients were high quality. The toasted marshmallow milkshake was decent. I could not decide between 3 and 4 stars, but the service was very good so I went with 4. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have been to Lamp twice now. Both experiences were great and here's why:  First trip we sat in the bar area and the bartender, James, waited on us. Very nice guy, easy to talk to, knew the menu well and gave us plenty of attention when the food arrived and drinks needed some refills.  I hate to say it but both trips to Lamp we ordered the same exact thing. Margherita Pizza and the Grape and gorgonzola Salad (i think that's what it's called). We had to get them again because they are so so good. The salad isn't covered in dressing and comes with the appropriate amount of grapes, gorgonzola and other toppings. Oh! It also comes with some bread, delicious.  The pizza is also very good. Crust is thin and delicious, great ratio of cheese/sauce and it's the perfect size to split between two people.  This is a great local sit down and order some good pizza kinda place. We will definitely be back and maybe this time try something new."}
{"text":"The place was very good! Yummy salad, bread (plain and sausage), and pizza. The atmosphere is super dark and trendy; perfect for a date. Grimaldi's is my place to go for pizza which I would go to if I had a bigger party due to the option to have a bigger pizza. I would go to LAMP on a date night. Nothing wrong with the food, very delicious all around. The reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because our meal was very rushed. 3 separate courses yet we were in and out within an hour which took away from a great restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and fast take out, if it isn't during the busy hours! Wood fired crust, quality cheese. Very tasty! The larges are smallish. Big enough for 1-2 people. Excellent and the service was great! Fast, when I walked in 10 min after ordering, our pizzas were hot and ready along with the check. We will be back."}
{"text":"LAMP, the pizza place with a strange name and amazing pizza. The freshness of the ingredients and the creativity of the combinations of toppings leave no need to \"create your own\". Tonight was my second visit for dinner, and it doesn't much get better than sitting on the patio sipping a fruit-filled white sangria while splitting a grape and gorgonzola salad, and a Gem pizza (sausage, pepperoni, basil, and ricotta). Plenty of food for two average people, and delicious doesn't cover it.   Our server was always attentive even though we were the only ones seated outside, and our four-top lingered long after the check just talking and sipping waters.   The inside of the restaurant is cozy with romantic vibe of low lighting. The smells that comes from that kitchen are as amazing as the perfect pizza. I definitely recommend this to anyone craving a well-crafted meal!"}
{"text":"Got the Gordon pizza which was delicious with perfect texture and crispy crust! The veggie red sauce pizza was good but soggy. The atmosphere is nice but really loud. I would definitely come here again and before the busy crowd hours if I wanted to hear the conversation."}
{"text":"I'm a crazy enough pizza fan to have built my own wood burning oven in the backyard. Suffice it to say, it is a lot of work making your own pies. I've been wanting to try Lamp out for awhile. We had the tessoro pie and thought it was delicious. I'm all about flavor in the dough, and I got hints of the delicious dough about every other bite. The most flavorful part for me was just before you hit the crust, the flavor of the dough pops in your mouth. And the sauce is nice and bright. The salted carmel gelato was great as well, along with the cookies that accompany it.  Best of all, the owner Matt, is super friendly, loves to make pizza and it shows. We had great conversation about pizza, toppings, sauces, dough, etc all while he kept cranking out the pies. Many of the pizza shops in town, the owner isn't around or not working the oven. If one opens a pizza shop cause they love pizza, I expect that owner to be making the pies, since I believe it's most critical. You can't hand over the reins to the dough, pizza, oven to some employee who doesn' thave the feel of the dough, or understand how to cook the pizzas properly."}
{"text":"As an Italian from New Jersey with multiple restaurant chefs in the family I don't know what others are eating here that has given this place such rave reviews. We started with the Fig-Sambuca Bruschetta which the presentation was great and it was very tasty but spreading out the cheese over the figs really improved the flavor since the way it is served you get a bite of cheese and then the second bite is fig no cheese. The combination of fig with cheese is much better. We then had the Margarita pizza which was bland, bland crust just pretty much tasteless, nothing memorable. Doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"The husband and I picked up a pizza and salad from here for dinner the other week. Both were outstanding. And we eat a lot of pizza and a lot of salads. Neapolitan isn't our favorite style but this was excellent. The salad was really simple and high quality. Even though it's outside of our 10 minute drive bubble, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is terrific!  Great service, fun, both red & white pizza's were delicious!  Truly recommend."}
