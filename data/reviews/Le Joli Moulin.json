{"text":"Tucked away in a cozy corner of Outremont, Le Joli Moulin can be easily missed amongst the many other french style bistros in the area. But you'd be missing out on the warm service and welcoming atmosphere that if you keep on walking.  We stumbled in here at around 10pm at night when the place was dying down, but the owners took care of us and made sure to let us know that we were in no rush. While their vegetarian selections were somewhat limited, they had the kitchen cook up something quick and delicious for my wife. I had the duck pate and a cheval blanc.  There was something magical about sitting out in the middle of street, our faces lit by the streetlight, enjoying a good conversation, while hearing the old proprietor sit behind you sipping his soup."}
{"text":"On our second visit to this restaurant we were not disappointed. The owner was kind enough to allow two of our party to order something from the lunch menu, lamb shanks, and they both licked their plates. The cream of zucchini was delicious, the salad pleasant, and my roast beef was perfection. The dessert was not quite \"there\", but nice. The service was perfect, we were allowed our space to dine and talk. I should mention the bread, artisan and crunchy, very tasty. All in all, we WILL be back. Truly."}
{"text":"I went here for lunches on special occasions twice, and it was delicious both times.  The service is friendly and knowledgeable. The place is certainly not packed at lunch time during the week, so you get a lot of attention.  And the food is French cuisine at its finest - I recommend the petoncles.   It might be a little out of the way, but this place is definitely worth a detour!"}
