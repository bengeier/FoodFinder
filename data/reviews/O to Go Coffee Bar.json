{"text":"Travelled from DC for a conference and wanted a good coffee shop and restaurant not around the convention center.   \"O to Go\" was a great find! I had dinner the evening before at Ocotillo (also fantastic!) and thought I'd check out the coffee bar in the morning. Extremely friendly staff, great coffee, and fantastic quiche! The inside is small (just the counter and bar seating along the wall), but the outside patio space is beautiful. If it had been a little warmer I probably would have hung around a little longer.   Will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I just got back from two weeks in France and Italy and drank a lot of cappuccino. What you guys make is as good or better than anything I had in Europe."}
{"text":"Not great. Not even good. Went in for coffee and got the worst service coupled with terrible coffee. The barista left my husband and my cups waiting while he flirted with a customer. Finally when he finished flirting and started playing on the cash register, I asked him about our \"drinks\" and he said they were almost ready and we both turned  and looked at the empty cups waiting. He did a few more things on the register and then proceeded to make our drinks. They were both finished within 2 minutes, so easily could've been done earlier. Mine was the cold brew coffee which obviously wasn't cold enough because 1/2 of the cup (no exaggeration) was ice. My cold brew was sour and disgusting. My husband and I may not be the hipsters we once were but we still deserve good service. Will never return."}
{"text":"My go to place for great drinks and great food.  Everyone is a pleasure to chat with and they take their time to make your drink just right every time. Kelly, Jessica, Lydon and Melissa are always there with a smile and make my day every time I visit."}
{"text":"I love the O to Go Coffee Bar! Kelly, Melissa, and Lydon are not only fabulous baristas, but they are amazing human beings who are caring, passionate, and super humorous! I drink fresh creative coffee drinks there everyday, and enjoy the fresh house-made pastries and treats. There is not a specialty coffee bar in town with such a huge list of food options. I also love that they vintage records all day. What a cool vibe"}
{"text":"Delicious cold brew and friendly baristas! I will be back. The cold brew was delicious and tasty."}
{"text":"Probably the best cold brew I've ever had and such a cute atmosphere. Will definitely be returning!"}
