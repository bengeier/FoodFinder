{"text":"Ordered two sheet pizzas for a party and they were perfect! Got lots of compliments and people asking where we ordered from."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza I love this Mom and Pop place. I wish we had more of these places and less franchise restaurants."}
{"text":"Monday night I ordered spaghetti  with 2 meatballs 2 sausages small antipasto with extra grated cheese and extra Sauce. They told me how long it would t√†ke  and it was ready on time. The pasta was al dente for me, just right, the sauce was just the right balance of acid and sweet and thickness. Coated the noodles just beautifully. Those light, pillow, flavorful meatballs that are a meal themselves. Just the right amount of Oregano, Basil, Garlic and other family secrets compliment this great addition.    I had the Sausage that comes out being a fresh baked hand shaped patty then finished , slowly in a pot of their freshly made tomato sauce, where it will cool in the same container to absorb more flavors.    The Antipasto was just the right size and quantity and quality of ingredients. The greens were crisp and dry, cherry tomatoes could have been cut behalf , eggs were freshly quartered, a couple more olives would have been nice, my favorite the peperonci had just the right bite and spice sprinkled with the mozzarella cheese and 2 cups House Dressing with a toasted garlic roll I used wipe up any remaining tomato sauce.    I learned back from the table and loosened my belt buckle and unbuttoned the top button on my pants like it was Thanksgiving or Christmas."}
{"text":"Do not believe any of the positive reviews.  Just moved into the area. Ordered the deluxe \"large\" and vegi \"large\" pizzas for my wife and two out of town friends for delivery.  None of us are food snobs but everyone was disappointed and still talking about it the next day.  Poor quality toppings, stale cheese, tasteless sauce cardboard for crust. Put simply... the pizzas tasted bad. Both pies were abysmally small  ... measured in at 11.75 inches in diameter.  I basically just spent $35 + tip on two Totinos frozen boxed pizzas. Will never order again."}
{"text":"Family owned and original old-fashioned pizza. When I'm not making my own pizza, this is one of my FAVS for sausage pizza. I'm not a sausage pizza person, but seems everyone I know is and this is where I order for gatherings. (familiar with for over 20 years)  Worthy of a Yelp!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, crispy and chewy crust, unique and flavorful sauce, and excellent cheese and toppings. Really a nice hearty pizza. And the subs are great too, with homemade bread and the right amount of sauce and cheese. We've loved this family-owned and operated pizza joint for almost 20 years."}
{"text":"Excellent, well priced, home made taste, courteous and prideful deliver man, and pleased the whole group of 13! Only thing that kept me from five stars was the boneless wings (a bit mushy on the breading, but hey, it was delivered) and the rolls needed some garlic or garlic salt for flavor. Pizzas were amazing. All 5 of them!"}
{"text":"We got some takeout here earlier this week.  We had chicken parmigiana, spaghetti and meatballs, stuffed pepper parmigiana, white spaghetti, meatball sandwich, and a cheese pizza.  I LOVED the sauce and meatballs.  One of the best tasting sauces I've ever had at a restaurant, and the meatballs were as close to my grandma's (perfection, to me) as I've ever had in a restaurant too.  The stuffed peppers were delicious, as well as the Italian salad dressing.  I think that most of the food was a good value too, especially the featured spaghetti and meatball special.  It was a ton of food for $5.95.  Adding spaghetti for $1 to the dinner entrees seems well worth the price too.  The one thing I didn't care for was the pizza.  The sauce wasn't very good, and it was really greasy.  And wayyyy too much cheese.  It was this thick leathery slab of cheese, and you couldn't take one bite without the whole thing coming off bc you just couldn't even bite through it.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Ohio period.   Homemade sauce is the difference.  An old Italian woman makes it, so it doesn't get more authentic.  It's a medium crust pizza. In between NY and Chicago style, I call it Cleveland style. I have eaten pizza from over 100 restaurants. Hands down this is the best pizza.   Tip: order it we'll done but not burnt."}
{"text":"Great pizza...thin crust with pepperoni is a favorite! Meatball sandwich is tasty. Overall, one of the best pizzas in Cleveland! Only problem for me is the hours! Sometimes I like to get Italian for lunch ...they don't open until 3 or 4 pm! Give us lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Place Has Gone Downhill  I have been ordering from Rosa's since I moved here, over 20 years now.  For the past couple of years I have noticed the quality of the service, and to some extent the quality of the food, has deteriorated.     Today was the final straw.  Placed an order and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes.  From past experience I know that they almost never have things ready in 25 minutes.  So I arrived 30 minutes after placing my order.  When I arrived there were 2 customers waiting for their orders.   It took the lady making the pizzas almost 2 minutes to even acknowledge my arrival.  Then all she said was that someone would be with me 'shortly'.  For the next 8 minutes I watched several employees scurrying around as though they had lost their way.  And no one came to the front counter during this period.    Finally a young man came to the counter and asked the other two customers what their orders were and then he asked me.  He said they were really slammed and there was no apparent reason.  Never apologized.  Then he left.  I waited almost 20 minutes for my order after I arrived.  So this was 45 minutes from the time I had placed the order even though I was told it would be 'about' 25 minutes.  If they were behind, why would they promise a 25 minute turnaround when they knew they were behind.  And to make matters worse, it appeared only one lady was making pizzas.    To top it off, the food wasn't particularly good.  So after 20+ years I am sad to say that I have crossed Rosa's off my list of places that I will order from in the future.  Some things improve with time.  This place isn't one of those."}
{"text":"We love the pizza and the pasta here. Their meatballs are just like my husband's Italian grandfather uses to make. They double grind the meat, so the meatballs are so tender that they practically melt in your mouth. They're so friendly - we feel lucky this is right around the corner from our house!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try local so we got a large pizza with wings and bosco sticks. ...And then we ended up with food poisoning. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"First off GO BLUE!!!!!   In town for work and was hoping to find some good pizza. Well I was disappointed. Pizza was overpriced. I order a large and my pizza looked like a medium. $17.95 for a large (medium) pizza. Wow! I asked for flavored crust and they don't do that. I asked for breadsticks and the lady said we just have rolls and garlic bread. Lol. Maybe flavored crust and breadsticks is a Michigan only thing. Lady working register was rude and short with me. Believe she was manager or owner. I would've been happier with Pizza Hut. Especially for the money I spent there. So thumbs down Rosa's."}
{"text":"I honestly don't recognize the place some of you are reviewing.  I just left there and here was my experience from start to finish.    1.  Called in and told the lady a coworker had referred me and wanted to give it a try.  She proceeded to laugh in a way that said, \"how dorky\".  It's the best way I can describe it.  I was annoyed.  Said pizza would be done in 25 mins.   2.  Show up and they process my order.  As I'm looking around I notice how disgusting the back was where they make the pizza.  Food on the ground.  Counters messy.  And then I look to my left in what is considered a cooler (the kind you see sodas in at the gas station..sliding glass doors) and what do I see?  Scattered pizza trays stacked on each other (yes...on top of each other) with the dough already made.  I used to work in a pizzeria and the dough was never made or left that way.  It looked like it had been there all day.  Not to mention how messy it was in there.  I proceeded to look further down the place behind their counter and I saw even more filth on the floor...counters...etc.  They were fairly nice...athough not very engaging.  It was like I was intruding.  Not a good feeling to give a customer.  .   3.  Get home and start to eat pizza.  The first thing I notice is how spicy the pizza was and greasy.  It was as if they put peppers in it or something.  Very atypical for a pizza.  Then I bite into the crust which was terrible.  Extremely hard...no flavor.  And this is coming from a \"crust-guy\".  I typically love the stuff.  The whole family gave the pizza at best a C- grade.    I understand the charm of it being a \"family\" owned place...but that does not always translate into being very good.  Just watch an episode of \"Restaurant Impossible\" and you'll see most small business ARE \"family\" owned.  Being \"family\" owned doesn't really mean anything concrete...in fact that can be a problem if family is working there and there is tension to get things done.  The result?  The place slowly falls apart.  What I saw today suggested this was the case at Rosas.      CONCLUSION:  The uncleanliness of the place told me one thing - - this \"family\" really doesn't care.  If they did, the cooking area would be clean as a whistle.  If they cared they would make the pizza fresh to order like a normal place does.  And if by some chance ours was fresh made, their crust and sauce was horrible tasting.  Lastly, if they really cared they would know how to treate a customer on the phone and in person.  Very strange experience overall and not a good one at that.    SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE:  Clean, clean, clean.  When I walk into a place I want to have confidence in the food I am eating.  If the floors, counters, fridge, etc. are filthy how do I know what I'm putting in my mouth isn't as well?  Secondly, put your pizza in a serious Cleveland contest and see how it does.  If it doesn't place highly, you would be well served to draw up another method of making it.  Because the one I had was really bad.  Lastly, the owners need to really train their staff on how to answer the phone and take orders.  Laughing at customers is a quick way to tick them off...especially after having a hard day's work and wanting to simply get some food for their families.....as was my case today.  I'm guessing this was a younger family member who doesn't quite \"get it\".  Another case where having a \"family\" business isn't always great if everyone isn't on board.  Especially if it is a generational issue.    TO THE OWNERS:  I hope you take this in the spirit it was intended - - constructive criticism.  You want to draw in as many people as you can...and I care about businesses.  Good luck on your journey."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is great old school pizza like I ate growing up from a mom & pop type place. Always delicious!  If you want mass produced pizza go to a mass produce pizza place. If you want good authentic pizza, come here."}
{"text":"Ordered a New York white pizza. I did not know there were two styles for white pizza. New York white is made with ricotta and mozzarella or provolone (can't remember which) with no sauce. It was so yummy! I liked the pizza a lot. The sausage they used had lots of flavor. Definitely will try them again!"}
{"text":"I got catering here and the pan of meatballs and sausages were amazing.  Best I ever had.  Better than little Italy!!!!!  The sausages were \"patty-like\" and huge. So flavorful and delicious. The meatballs were big too. Great sauce. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and a pizza.  The wings I got hot teriyaki, which were good.  Not so hot.  I would have liked a little more spicy.  But everything else about them was fine.  The pizza was good too.  One of those pepperoni under the cheese types.  The crust wasn't amazing, and I wouldn't mind more sauce, but it was unique in flavor to the other pizzas I've had so far in town."}
{"text":"Ordered at this place for the first time on Mother's Day with about 6 people to feed.  I've never needed more than 2 large Papa Johns to feed the same people. Pizza was ok, but the 2 large pizzas I got were the size of mediums . Had to order at Gioninos which is a little bit farther away, but same quality,  same price, and bigger pizzas. My family had to wait an extra 30 mins for food."}
{"text":"hands down the worst service EVER .. went inside & saw there are a few booths so I figured you could eat in .. no way .. what I assumed was the owner yelled at us when we sat down saying they do take out only & that she \"does not like\" to serve food for eat in patrons .. so she got ZERO of our business .. take out or otherwise .. take out the booths if you do not want people to assume you can eat in .. or how about being more polite about it .. we will NEVER return"}
{"text":"We tried Rosa's for the first time last night and were very happy with our pizza. It was made as we asked - no burns anywhere. Flavorful and not overly sweet as some pizzas have become. The kitchen had 3 Italian grandma's in it speaking Italian to each other. I don't think you can get more authentic than that! We will be back and look forward not only to pizza but some of the other menu offerings. Oh - this really would be best as a carry out place. They do have two small booths in the front but it would be pretty functional to eat in. They also offer home delivery but since we are close by we probably will pick it up ourselves."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza we've had since we moved to the West Side. The delivery kid is always polite and takes a moment to pet my dog. The price and service are very good also."}
{"text":"EXACTLY what you want in a corner pizza joint.  Rosa's has the best pepperoni pizza going.  The side salads are delicious as well.    There's not a whole lot else to be said; if you're in Parma/Broadview Heights and want a killer, reasonably-priced pizza, head to Rosa's."}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from here many times.  The crust is always perfect and crisp.  The sauce is good and the toppings are quality.  It is a small shop in a corner plaza, hidden from the main streets, but it is the best pizza around here.    I only ever eat the pizza and garlic bread, and none of the newer pizzerias is anywhere near as good.  If you want pizza, eat here."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times and never stopped.  Part of the reason is because I work out and stopping to get pizza on the way home is MAYBE not a good idea....  So that's why I ordered a chicken sandwich.  No, I didn't order the pizza....didn't you see the work-out reference earlier?  Anyway, it was a frozen chicken patty on an italian roll.  It was okay.  I don't believe they put on any sauce (no mayo/mustard/etc) so it was pretty bland.  Also, did I mention it was previously frozen?  It's not hard to tell...  So in short.  Eh.  Then again, I didn't order the pizza (which did look really good)"}
{"text":"Ordered sheet pizza for my kids bday party. Price reasonable and accommodated my request to have half pepperoni/half sausage and half cheese. Lady who took my call had an Italian accent and was very friendly and patient as I shouted over my kids to give the order and gain consensus. So far so good.  The sheet pizza tasted great, fresh, authentic, and there was enough for my whole party.  I will be ordering from this place again."}
