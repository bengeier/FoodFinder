{"text":"Great Food, Service, Prices and Restaurant. That's why I'm give Viva a five star! Eat out on a beautiful sun day!
I'll be back again and again!! 
I'll have to tell my friends that live in the area of Huntersville."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Wish we had one home, in Central NY.  Had the 1/4 chicken, fantastic!"}
{"text":"I saw this place being built so definitely wanted to try it out when it opened. I had the half chicken with brown rice and fries. I had the herbal lemonade for a drink. All of this for $16 which was a bit overpriced for the money. The chicken had a nice flavor but was a little slimy which rotisserie chicken can be. The brown rice was good, but the fries were mediocre at best. I saw a write-up where they were mentioned as 'best fries in town' and that is certainly NOT true. They tasted very much like the greasy fry-daddy taste with either too much oil or the oil needed to be changed. Plus you didn't get that many and the brown rice came in a pretty small cup. The herbal lemonade tasted weird and not refreshing. The whole time I kept thinking 'what's in this?' and not in a good way. This place is in the same plaza as Whole Foods so you are better off getting something similar at the hot bar there instead."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is always good. It's always fresh and hot. The staff keeps the tables clean and the floors swept. I love consistency and this place has it. Their sauces are wonderful too. There is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We came here once before a soccer game and it was brand new I honestly did not know what to expect... But I walked in, it was so clean and nice, and the smell was amazing!

 Well we ordered our drinks first and I think it was a half sweet and half unsweet tea, and it tasted awesome! Not to sweet but not to \"unsweet\" the tables were really clean, and the service was extremely nice, and willing to help. 

When I got the food, I ordered something pretty casual, I thought it was going to be really greasy (witch I did not hope it would be) but it came out and tasted fresh and definitely clean. I loved this place when I went and I strongly recommend this place... This is all why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it really was not THE BEST thing in the whole world but I bet it beats some greasy fast food... It was not very fancy (I am fine with) but it sure was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place has really good chicken.  Their fried plantains are also great! (I'm a sucker for fried plantains, so I always eat too many.)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We shared a half chicken, and it exceptionally small for the price. As a result the breast portion was dry. The specs seemed fine, but the staff was reluctant to share any ingredients so we could determine whether they would trigger my wife's allergies. My French fries were very good, but my wife thought the salad dressing was terrible. Fortunately, it was served on the side. We will not return."}
{"text":"I love the Viva chicken in Charlotte. I was thrilled to see one in Huntersville! But dang it they have some things to work on! First off, the building looks amazing. The atmosphere is great too. Service has always been quick and friendly.

I always order the Viva Tacu bowl and the beans are drenched into the rice which made the rice all soggy. Rice soaked in bean juice isn't too tasty. The other location always has nice, fluffy rice at the bottom. Strain the beans please! Me and my fiancé also had tons of gristle in our bowls that we kept having to spit out... not fun! I also found a chicken bone in one bite. It made the entire meal hard to eat as we had to be cautious with each bite. I love you guys, I really do but this location needs some fine tuning."}
{"text":"This is the tastiest food near Davidson NC. Totally fresh and fast service. Sauces Arron the side serve yourself. Wait staff is friendly and accommodating. Try it and you'll be addicted!!"}
{"text":"Great takeout--order online to skip ahead."}
{"text":"Incredible!!! The food is some of the best in the Huntersville/Charlotte area and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Don't let the lunch rush hour discourage you, the wait is worth it. Every time I'm in Huntersville now, stopping here is a must! Thanks to my sister-in-law for getting me hooked on the FULL order of the quinoa stuffed avocado! Pairs nicely with the herbal limeade as well. Thanks for never disappointing."}
{"text":"Oh man! Get in the car and drive here NOW! I took two bites and was already planning to come again! If you like rotisserie chicken, you will die for this chicken. Most flavor you can get! I also got sweet potato fries and fruit and they were super good! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner on the way to Charlotte. Was a delightful surprise that makes me wish we had one back home. Chicken falls off the bone and the Peruvian flavors are wonderful.  Plenty of healthy choices that don't make you feel like your missing out on food fun.  Had the 1/4chicken with green beans and fries. Delicious, and filling without making me feel uncomfortable. A must try if your in the area and want a quick eat in without full table service."}
{"text":"Such good food!  I love viva chicken.  It's quality relatively-fast-food. Service is fine. It's pretty basic, order at the counter and they bring it to your table. If you have three or more people, highly recommend getting the whole chicken with sides.  It's a good deal."}
{"text":"First time to Viva Chicken. Recommended by almost everyone I know. Service was quick as the food was brought to our table. My wife had the quarter chicken, excellent flavor. She used one of the staple doing sauces to give a little bit of heat. I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich. Nicely done. Would order both again. My favorite was the chicken soup made with super fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"OMG this place is always fantastic! Keep wanting to try everything else on the menu but can't get past the Arroz Chaufa fried rice."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  Very simple. My favorite part is the different sauces they have at the condiment bar."}
{"text":"Trendy \"faster\" food place with a modern atmosphere. Food was decent but not overly exciting. Better than a fast food burger but not a place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is fresh Peruvian, rotisserie chicken served with great sides. We highly recommend ordering a full chicken (you will have leftovers) and then you get 3 sides to enjoy. The fried yucca is great dipped in the green dipping sauce from the free sauce bar. The white cilantro rice is my favorite side. It's a large portion to share. Finally, I enjoy a cup of their chicken soup as a side. Mmm... It's delicious and homemade. I would also recommend the passion fruit juice to go with your meal. It's very fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always awesome. The spicy sauce is amazing on everything too. I will say I always call ahead of order online, as the line to order is always out the door. The reason for this long line though is the food just amazing! My favorite dish is the Arroz Chaufa with all white chicken added and 3 servings of the spicy sauce mixed in. The great wrap is my second favorite."}
{"text":"Oh my AMAZZZZING food! I have not found one food item I don't just absolutely love! But my absolute mouth waters at the thought....I will smack you if reach for it .... Don't make act out...is the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado with chicken... The whole one is plentiful ... and you will get full.... and ... Still mad at my son for eating my left over .... Arroz Chaufa with chicken of course... Tummy doing back flips of happiness right now just thinking about it...  

Also the prices are reasonable, the staff very nice and there something for the kiddies too! Wooohooo! It's a win win win! 

Great place! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Food is great.  Service is awesome.  Congrats on the 99 health rating."}
{"text":"Yum. Wildly popular, so it can get crowded.

The sauces are tasty, my fave is the green. Chicken is delicious and moist.

Had their taco bowl with steak recently and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is amazing! My go-to is the arroz chaufa with chicken and a side of the quinoa stuffed avocado. Also, load up on lots of green sauce."}
{"text":"Love the fast casual format. One of the best Peruvian chicken I ever had. The chicken was flavorful and moist. Yuca fries and plantain were both good. My only complaints are that the food is a bit pricy, the rice was blend, and the passion fruit juice was too sweet."}
{"text":"Went about two weeks after it opened and it was too noisy, crowded and it's a no table service restaurant  you line up and order like fast food. Paper and plastic dining tools and a drink station. Food is pricey and smallish portions. They were out of bread and my chicken was barely done . Bojangles next door Hello!"}
{"text":"I had the stuffed avocado with quinoa and it was excellent.  Also had yucca fries and some canary beans and I can say they were delicious. I will definitely come again with my family that is not Vegan but I have options to eat here with them. The staff was very friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"I originally went to the location in Charlotte across from Presbyterian Hospital, where I fell in love with their food. The Huntersville location is just as awesome. I am a huge fan of their chicken, however , if you a prefer a wrap, the Inca wrap is my favorite. You may want to get it light in the onions though if you want to go back to work or kiss anybody later lol. My family members also like the chicken Caesar Salad. Try ALL the sauces to find your favorite. They are excellent. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Viva chicken is my go to spot for two amazing dishes.  Th e and in a quinoa salad and the Arroz chaufa.  Service is always grat.  Restaurant really nice and comfortable.  The staff is always really great as well.  Parking is rely good too."}
{"text":"Placed my fiance on hold for for 10 minutes and so we couldn't place to go order. Then after waiting 15 minutes and three customers after me I finally get my food.  Unlikely to patron this establishment again

Well, my daughter insisted on trying again.  Guess what...same problem.  Waited nearly 10 mins on hold and then 15mins at the restaurant waiting for food.  

Happens once...shame on them...happens again, shame on me.  There will not be a third time.  They suck"}
{"text":"Really good and different! The sauces alone were worth trying this place.  Its was also modesty priced."}
{"text":"Love this place. High quality food and always very good. My only complaint is that occasionally the chicken isn't picked well enough and there will be fat or something on it but that has only happened to be twice. People are nice, pretty quick and very good. Love the quinoa salad with chicken, the fried rice, the avacado with chicken, and the chicken with 2 sides- sweet pot fries are great. My favorite thing by far are the amazing sauces! The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the soup because it's not really soup there is hardly any broth in it- but I've only had it once so maybe it was an off day. I've had 2 of the wraps as well but from the location in Charlotte (this location in huntersville is much better)."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! Viva has some of the best rotisserie chicken you will have for a good price. I most recently visited the Huntersville location on Wednesday March 29th around 12:15pm. I've heard it's usually extremely busy around lunch time, but I had no issues and received my food very quickly. If you are worried Viva being too busy, you can call ahead or order online. They have a separate pick-up line in which you can get your food within a couple minutes. 

I normally eat a lot, so I usually order a 1/2 chicken, which comes with two sides. Today my two sides were green beans and rice. This is a hefty portion and is enough for two meals for most people. The sauce is AMAZING. There are 3 options - mild, medium, and hot, but I always go with the mild (Aji Amarillo). The sauce goes really well with the chicken but I think it goes best on the rice! 

I have never had an issue with the service at Viva - the people are always friendly!! I love the food and I'm sure I will be back soon - maybe even this week!  I just wish a Viva would open a little closer to where I live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love viva chicken! I've had several of the sandwiches and salads and haven't had one I don't like.  Avocado with quinoa is really good."}
{"text":"Cilantro flavored rice is flavored perfectly and fluffy grain soak up the three sauce choices. The soup is a huge bowl filled with chicken and filling. Shame on me for not recalling the Peruvian names for our dishes and each time I visit I am overwhelmed by choices, nothing ordered ever disappoints.  The will help you, but you order at the counter and I just ordered something new and look at it like a delicious delightful new discovery.  Chicken  done right!!  Alfajores are cookies with dolce de leche filled with power sugar tops, yummy.  No room after eating, so those are served tonight with coffee."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  You really cant go wrong with anything! Make sure you get the half avocado and add chicken!!"}
{"text":"I believe I've found my new foodie stop for my out of town guest who want to try something different. My husband and I went on a Saturday evening and it was busy. Busy but the service was swift. We both ordered the 1/4 chicken with two sides. My chicken was flavored well and we tried all of the sauces.my favorite was the spicy and green cilantro. My canary beans were seasoned nicely and complimented my cilantro rice well. My husband said his string beans we flavored well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a 1/2 chicken with 2 sides. They let you pick from dark vs. white meat, which is awesome for a Peruvian style rotisserie cooked chicken. With a hint of spice and the robust herb based sauces to select from, the chicken tastes remarkable. Great healthy way to eat with some ice sides like quinoa. What I loved further was their commitment to sustainability by using plant recycled cutlery, sugarcane composted plates. Nice to see a for profit model work with making these environment friendly simple alternatives economically viable."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is a reliable go to for me. I love ordering online and just picking it up. Everything on their menu is delicious and their sauces are amazing. The quality of meat is good. The chicken stuffed avocado is a favorite, but their plantain fries are pretty high up there too! This time around, I went with the tacu bowl with steak. I love the way they flavor the steak and how everything comes together really well. You get a fairly large sized portion, which I can usually split into two meals. You could try something different each time you come here and not be disappointed. Their salads are good too."}
{"text":"So happy this location has added steak like the original location on Elizabeth Ave.  All items are delicious.  Best Peruvian food ever!  Don't  forget to try the sauces too."}
{"text":"This one fast became my favorite restaurant after moving here a year ago. We've never had anything bad, it's so simply delicious. We have tried the wraps and the quarter chicken. I tried the chicken soup last night as a side item, and it was absolutely TO DIE  for!!  It's all healthy and cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly every time! You must try the yellow dipping sauce if you get the roasted chicken, I could drink it, it is so good!"}
{"text":"Shout out from Dallas, Texas!!! All I can say is....Amazing!!!!! This place is fantastic. Tasty, fresh, quantity, quality, authentic, and absolutely fantastic staff , Over-all seems very healthy!! sauces are yummmy!!

They have a very good thing going here and if they can just keep up with their popularity they will do well! I highly recommend this place and.......

I'll definitely be back on my next trip to North Carolina!!"}
{"text":"1. Chicken soup is excellent. The only thing I would change if I ordered it again is to have rice on the side instead of putting it in my soup. It was too much rice for me.
2.  Their beans are delicious 
3.  Stuffed avocado is very fresh"}
{"text":"My family and I visited the other locations and we're happy this one is open because it's closer.  The cashiers were pleasant and eficient, plus  and I could hear them explaining menu items to newcomers. The layout is similar to the Ballantyne location. The wait from ordering to getting our food was beyond normal/ A table next to us had been waiting for an appetizer, so long that it arrived after the entrees. It appeared the to-go orders was taking precedent over those families patiently waiting. you have to find a balance,. I guess they figure we we would be more flexible dining, not we are used to fast casual dining.  Food was tasty;however, the cilantro rice was a little salty on this visit. Strange to us. We loved that they had the sauces in large disenspers similar to the ketchup at Wendy's. Beats asking those upfront for another sauce. Attendants walked around a la Chick-Fil-A and asked if we needed refills or anything else. That's a nice touch provided they don't began to hover. Also employees stayed tidying this up which is good.  Another note, they don't have the rewards available at this location yet.  Cashier asked us to keep receipts for the other location to add.  They have ony been open two weeks, so we will see how they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Great, outstanding roasted chicken, fries and their sauces are an excellent addition to the meal.   The whole family enjoyed the meal.  We'll be back to enjoy again!"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy and flavor packed food. The huacatay sauce is the perfect amount of kick!"}
{"text":"One of the worst services and expetiemce Ive had ever! I order take out, a basic Viva salad with added the chicken. Twenty minutes later, yes 20 minutes of waiting for a frozen salad. Cucumbers, lettuce and what should have been tomatoes were all ice cold next to frozen. (Mgr Christopher did compensate me for the wait. In fact my meal was free)I tried to eat around the veggies and eat the chicken and avocado as I was so hungry and disappointed that I ordered a to-go meal and fortunately for me tossing a free meal in the trash wasnt so painful. Will i return? No!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  Stopped by after church.  Great looking setup.  Service was good.  Very clean.  Staff was very helpful and made sure we had what we needed from start to finish.  Will return."}
{"text":"I love rotisserie chicken. Latin countries have really great rotisserie but nothing like Peruvian chicken. This is a genius chain. My husband and I both got the half chicken with 2 sides. I got the cilantro rice and plantains and he got yuan and plantains. The rice was decent and the Yuca was pretty yummy. We were dessappointed that almost everyone at the table had under cooked plantains. My mom actually said something and they brought her new ones and they were still a little undercooked. Maybe someone that has never cooked or eat plantains regularly wouldn't know the difference but we do. Either way the chicken was DELICIOUS. Thry have several sauces to pair with the chicken and sides bit I'm not a sauce perso. the decor gives me a bit of Chipotle vibes, very rustic, industrial kinda decor. They have Pepsi products FYI. I would highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We are in from out of town and decided to stop on in. We got a whole chicken and that was enough for my wife, my 4 yo and myself.  It had amazing flavor and was very juicy.  For our sides we chose green beans (which I think were my favorite green beans ever), sweet potato fries and rice.  Everything was delicious and great service."}
{"text":"Ordered online and arrived 15 minutes after assigned pickup time. They gave me a pager!
May want to work on that! But the food makes it worth the hassle I guess!"}
{"text":"This has been our go to  lunch place! Best chicken Caesar salad. Till today when I ordered one. I was told chicken was extra charge. When my salad arrived I got lots of chicken, steamy hot piled on my dressed salad greens. They became soggy right away. Not appetizing... I mentioned this to a staff member who checked on me. She blew it off, saying sorry the chicken was just shredded still hot doesn't happen usually. Meanwhile a salad was being served nearby, steaming hot smashing the greens into mush. And they took the bacon off the Caesar. Really? Still love herbal lemonade. But will be getting dressing, chicken, and a little bacon on the side for possible future lunches."}
{"text":"So happy I finally got to try this place. Kept seeing these wonderful pictures and they didn't disappoint. Their stuffed avocado is to die for. And their sauces make everything that much better. Nothing bad to say. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I stopped in here while shopping because so many in my book club had been raving about it.  I was curious to try it being from CA where El Pollo Loco has a solid following due to their flame broiled chicken and reasonable prices.  Viva Chicken is MUCH more expensive but is still  tasty chicken.  I ordered 2 pieces of white meat chicken, cilantro rice and an iced tea.....the bill was north of $12.  The rice was okay but nothing exceptional.  I like the fact that they are offering a healthier option  here rather than the usual \"fried food frenzy\" usually offered here in NC.  I just wish it was a more affordable option."}
{"text":"HATED IT! I did not enjoy the food at Viva Chicken.
Only giving it a 5 star rating because I met some of my favorite people while suffering through a meal at this restaurant. I will only ever return to this establishment for the fellowship never the food and I will go kicking and screaming every single time. I think it is also important to mention that I am an extremely picky eater and I don't really like many types of food so please don't take my review too seriously. I have heard nothing but great things from normal eaters."}
{"text":"The chicken is incredibly delicious! Although, the side portions of yuca and plantains aren't enough for what you paid for. I got the family deal ($23) and  wasn't too content with the portions. It's kinda pricey but might just be worth it. This is a place I'd visit at least twice a month. Overall staff was very pleasant and the restaurant was kept nice and clean!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to Huntersville although I miss Dairy Queen :(. Anyway. I do enjoy their rotisserie chicken wrap and their fries are tasty. My grandmother gets the chicken fried rice dish and it's enough for 2 adult servings. She loves it and it tickles her fancy to have leftovers!"}
{"text":"After hearing all of the hype of Viva Chicken I finally got around to trying it. Now I see what all of the hype is about, this place is amazing! For my meal I ordered the 1/4 chicken with the side salad and the chicken soup. Everything was absolutely delicious. The chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned, the salad was served with a tangy balsamic dressing, and the soup was both fresh and soul comforting. I normally opt for water with my meal but the herbal lemonade was the perfect complement to my meal. I really hope that they sell the lemonade by the gallon because when I come back I would love to bring some home."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better Viva Chickens in the area.  It's in the shopping center with Whole Foods.

Rotisserie chicken, Peruvian flavors (fried Yuca, etc.) are delicious.  The place routinely delivers quality food and the prices are reasonable.  Compared to the other local options, you could do a lot worse health-wise.  

Pro tip:  Call ahead or order online.  They have a separate pickup line for takeout orders and you can usually get in and out in about 2 minutes.

Food is good, but not stellar.  Otherwise would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've eaten way too many Tacu Bowls in the past year. Always fast and fresh food, friendly and quick service. We go here almost once a week! The food is super flavorful and satisfying. Good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken. Pleasant service. Tasty sauces.  Healthy choices. Biodegradable plates and utensils. What's not to like? Superb."}
{"text":"Their chicken dishes are phenomenal, however no steak at this location. Been crowded since it opened so they must be doing something right. Portions are great and I love the wraps. It is order yourself and sit down, so don't expect more. Food is fresh and delicious. Will be making it a regular! Glad they expanded north"}
{"text":"A little pricey but fresh and tasty. I'm glad they finally put one on this side of town. Right now it stays packed because it's new but I will have this spot in heavy rotation."}
{"text":"Love you viva chicken.  What awesome pollo a la brasa and you have a freaking pump station for you Aji!!!!!  My god this is the greatest thing I have ever seen and need to start bring buckets to fill up with.  You lose 1 star for not having  Papa a la Huancaína at this location.  This is more of a peruvian fusion restaurant and that is ok with what they have going on."}
{"text":"Great food each and every time we visit. It's always fresh, staff is always nice. Sweet potato fries here are some of the best ever as they are done just right. Love to see they keep expanding and looking forward to having one closer to eat at more often."}
{"text":"Not just for carnivores! I've been to the Charlotte location a few years ago and was not too impressed by limited veggie options (quinoa stuffed avocado, sides and salads). When I found out HVille was opening a location I didn't really care until I heard from a few folks they have a lot more veggie options now. So I am a little late in reviewing but I am a big fan! You walk in and fall in line to order. They give you a # and you find an open table and wait patiently for your meal to come to you. Most of their menu is basically set up as a vegetarian based and you add the meat topping as a $ option (chicken or steak). I went with the Inca wrap. Delicious and stuffed with the right amount of ingredients. Not too over or underwhelming. I was incredibly surprised. Add a bit of their mild in-house sauce and plaintains and we have a winner. I also ordered their Herbal tea. A little on the sweet side but the basil and rosemary tone it down. I could barely taste the lemon."}
{"text":"Takes Chipotle to the next level.  Broad selection and similar approach as Piata (Peruvian vs Italian)."}
{"text":"My wife and I love eating from this place.  This place has great gluten free options for those that need it.  

The roasted chicken is cooked and seasoned well.  The quinoa stuffed avocados are excellent.  I like just getting a side of rice and mixing it with there yellow or orange sauce.

Make sure you get there sauces for the food as they are excellent.  The yellow sauce has the least amount of heat.  The orange and green sauce are both a bit spicierz"}
{"text":"Rainy day and have been wanting to try this place out for some time now. Considering it was raining, so did everyone else. Very crowded and noise level was very high.

Walked in a got in line to place our order at the counter.  My wife ordered The Great which is a Sun Dried Tomato Wrap while I went with the Naked Peruvian on Ciabatta Bread and upscaled and added Chicken since that is their specialty to the sandwich. Beverage list is a bit strange with nothing that looked familiar so ended up with Herbal (Basil) Lemonage.

Something must have gotten lost in the kitchen because my Naked Peruvian was totally devoid of the Chicken I had paid extra to get.  The fried Yuca I ordered as side was very good.

All in all, not a bad organic sandwich which would have been better if the Chicken I ordered was there.  Wife did enjoy her wrap however.

Staff is very efficient and kept the tables cleaned and turned over rapidly which is a good sign.  Otherwise, noisy crowded and probably not at the head of my list for a revisit."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  I had 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice and plantains. Everything was awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. The cashier Mathew was very rude and nasty. The food was okay, however it's not worth the poor customer service that I experienced from Mathew today"}
{"text":"This was a soft opening so the menu was limited. I had the 1/4 chicken with a side salad and yuca fries. The chicken was very flavorful and tender, great job! They had 3 different sauces to choose from, I really liked the mild (green) sauce. 
My friends ordered the roasted chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and the fries were really crunchy. 
This place is going to be a hit in this area."}
{"text":"I had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with cilantro white rice and the fries. The chicken was good, but the white portions, although not dry, were dryer than I would have liked. The rice was good, healthy, but a bit bland. The fries were good. I also tried the Lomo Saltado (Steak with fries) and although chewy, was decent. 

The star of the show was the aji (chili) sauce. They have 3 options and all are great and make every dish excellent. The Peruvian soda, Inca Cola, is the only soda I thoroughly enjoy drinking, give it a shot!

I love the layout, the eco friendly plates, silverware, etc, and the staff was friendly. They also sell beer! (Modelo Negro, Corona). 

Overall I like this place, would go back, and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"If your latin or mediter   ....perfect place.   I cant figure out what I am eating here."}
{"text":"I dropped by this place today with high hopes of a great take home meal. Having visited NYC several times, I'm pretty familiar with the wonderful Peruvian chicken found there; however, this was not the same. I got a half chicken, chaufa rice with beans and plantains. I have to say the chicken was dry and parts were down right over cooked. The saving grace was the sauce... Very tasty and surely helped with the dryness. The rice was pretty good but the beans had way too much pepper and the plantains were ok. I will say that the young lady that waited on me was fabulous. It was my first time there and she took the time to answer all my questions very patiently... Her name was Tatyana. Was it worth the $20 something dollars I spent? Not a chance"}
{"text":"Family friendly sums this place up. If you're a foodie snob like me, you'll probably just rate this place as \"good.\" Maybe a step above that. I liked my food, which was an inca wrap with extra bits added to it for a price (cheese, bacon, etc).  

Not too much to say other than if you have a family and you want a better alternative to fast food, this is the way to go. Not too expensive, fairly priced, and depending on what you get, especially from a kid's perspective, you'll certainly have leftovers (if you get the rotisserie chicken basically) for someone young or with a small appetite. 

Worth a visit. The sauces are great and add a nice kick to the food. I thought the medium spice level was solid. The high spice level... I've had spicier things in life, don't get me wrong, I just felt it took away from the meal. 

Enjoy, at least once! Best for lunch. 

Parking is easy. Service is incredibly friendly. I saw more than once staff helping first-timers order or explain the menu."}
{"text":"After moving to north Charlotte, I had to verify that I loved every single Viva Chicken location that I've been to. I added this one to the list. Ever delicious. Only problem was that the sauce pump I was using was empty. I alerted a staff member only to find out that the pump was full, but jammed. Someone unclogged it, but it clogged right back again.

Whatever, I got enough sauce and Viva Chicken is delicious. Go there now."}
{"text":"Food is great. Atmosphere is good, but a bit noisy.  The lines look a little overwhelming at lunch time but they move pretty quickly.  If you're looking for a good (and healthy if you choose) alternative to fast food, Viva Chicken is for you!"}
{"text":"This is only a review for Huntersville.  I went 8/14 and the menu still seemed to be about half of the Elizabeth location.  I asked for the classic saltado (the best item hands down) and the cashier even knew to say, \"Sorry, this location doesn't have steak.\"  What?  I suspect they hiding some of the sandwiches also.  I ended up with the arroz chaufa with chicken, which is just chicken fried rice with red onion added.  It's very good, and not salty at all like the chinese version always ends up.  I see another reviewer said the portion sizes are small.  They would only be small if you plan on putting 100 lbs very quickly because this dish is just a pile of food.
  My wife got something with chicken, avocado, and lime soaked red onion.  I'd look up the name but I'm still mad about the steak thing.  Anyway, it was the better choice. 
  I was so excited that they were building a franchise up on the nice side of town.  The Elizabeth area is so shady.  Indeed, it was packed.  However, now I'm just left dreaming of classic saltado."}
{"text":"Had an issue with an order, manager stepped right in to make it right. Now that's customer service. Mess ups will happen, after all we are human but how we handle it is up in the air. Viva you get 5-stars for amazing customer care!"}
{"text":"The food is really fantastic. The Amarillo sauce is great too. This would be 4 stars but every time I order from here they manage to screw something up. If you order to go make sure to check your bag before you leave. Open up the boxes to double check. Every time I call in an order they manage to miss something, which results in a second order which I have to wait around for while the first order gets cold."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Viva and decided to stop in and try it out since we were in the area. The layout reminded me of City BBQ because you stand in line  and order your food then they will bring it to you if you're dining in. Customer service is the best. I ordered the Sopa de Pollo, once I received it it was like a chicken soup hints? *Sopa* lol didn't realize but I had something totally different pictured in my head when I ordered it. Definitely not disappointed because it was good."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Everything here is delicious. The rotisserie chicken is awesome, the cilantro rice - wow. The tostones and yuca - yum. And the sauces !! They have little pumps with a few sauces you can use with your meal or take them to go. They're spectacular. The workers are super friendly and nice.  We've been here only two times - first time the chicken was a bit better as the second time it was a little burnt. Overall still great.  You can sit down or get things to go. The Inca soda is also really good. A bit pricey but unique and delicious. The tacu bowl I got last time and that was good. I saw a lot of people with some kind of huge rice plate that had lots of veggies and it looked awesome. Next time I'll probably try that.  I'd say the best deal is a rotisserie chicken meal with multiple sides.  It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the Charlotte area"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Viva again for the first time in a while. Much better. No bones in my wrap and everything was fantastic. Love the sauces and the passion fruit drink is tasty."}
{"text":"Might as well round out my reviews of Viva Chicken. I have reviewed the other two but have not touched this one. Until now.

Went with a friend on a cold January afternoon. The Great Sandwich warmed me right up. Fresh chicken, onion, a special mayo, avocado, bacon...delicious. Then throw in the sauces and you have yourself quite the meal. Yucca fries are always a good option on the side and they work well with the dipping sauces.

Not much more to say. Look at the reviews of any Viva Chicken and you have your answer on whether it's good or not (hint: it is)."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times and it's always busy. Food is extremely tasteful, seems fresh and clean. The amount of food you get for your money is spot on the staff is respectful and the decor is upscale. Overall a great place with a very distinctive taste."}
{"text":"Always a busy place at lunch but their food is consistently good and the basil limeade is so addictive."}
{"text":"We love Viva Chicken! My husband and I eat here every week! The chicken is tasty and the arroz chaufa is fabulous but my favorite is the quinoa stuffed avocado! It is to die for!  Love this place!  Don't forget to order plantains! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"If you have never eaten authentic Peruvian food and have no concept of Peruvian food you'll LOVE this place! However if you're familiar with authentic Peruvian food you'll be very disappointed. 

To start Peruvian dishes are served with a variety of delicious sauces and juices so serving food on PAPER PLATES is a horrible idea as the plate absorbs everything! Whomever the brainchild was behind that idea should be fired! 

Moving along to their food, it's the equivalent of a \"POLLO TROPICAL\" a fast food chicken spot but they claim to be Peruvian. Their chicken has good flavor and that's where it ends. Everything else is subpar beginning with their extremely tough Lomo Saltado. Their prices are too expensive for the low quality of food they serve. And my search for REAL Peruvian food continues. 

If anyone knows of an Authentic Peruvian restaurant please let me know."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat! We love Viva and go all the time! I could eat the chicken soup everyday!"}
{"text":"The manager Christian is awesome. The food is awesome. Sometimes the lines stink, but there's plenty of employees there. They FINALLY got the steak products. The best! They were slow to open and were running or of product at the beginning, but they're all good and seem to be running smoothly now. Very good food."}
{"text":"I have always loved VIVA but after going dairy free I like it even more!! So many options for dairy free and my son Loves it!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine. This place is clean and always busy. We ordered the fried rice with chicken, a side order of plantains, and water. The rice is so good and the chicken is moist. The serving size is large and was enough for me to have left overs. It was good with all three sauces. The plantains were sweet and cooked well. I didn't try the passion fruit juice but I will the next time. I love coming to this place."}
{"text":"A delightful carbon-copy of the original location. And with the new menu that offers four insanely-delicious salads, it makes me question why I go anywhere else for lunch during the week. Or on the weekend. Or for breakfast. Damn! They're not open for breakfast. Minus three stars."}
{"text":"Mmmm....so tasty. I've gotten several things on the menu and they have all been so good. The Arroz Chaufa is my favorite, but be prepared to glutton yourself, or take part of it home, because it is a big meal. Also, if you're hungry plan to call ahead and pick up (even if you are going to eat there) - every time I've gone the line has been long and since the food is freshly made it takes a while to get your meal after you order."}
{"text":"Just ok. Rushed you through the order process. Dark place at night. Had to find the condiment station and drink fountain. 

Ordered 1/4 Chicken and was great. Sauces were great. But the 2 sides I ordered were horrible. Green Beans were lukewarm and sweet potato fries were cold. 

All the sauces were in a pump canister, why not the ketchup? 

Next time I'll ask for fresh cooked fries when I order. But you shouldn't have to in the first place."}
{"text":"From Elizabeth to Northcross, Viva chicken is always legit. As they have been branching out to new places, one thing I've noticed is the product is always good. 

The Northcross location is larger than the other three locations. Not much more to say, it's just becoming a multiple chain restaurant that's a little outside of the ordinary with good food. 

Still my all-time favorite is their chicken soup. Light and full of flavor... the only thing that I'm disappointed about is the fact that they made the bowl smaller for the same price."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  I am so glad they opened up at the lake.  Arroz Chaufa is the way to go.  Plantains are really good."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT HEALTHY CHOICE. The sauces, seasoning, and creativity are a refreshing change. I usually like to order something more \"fun\" when I eat out, but the salads here are amazing. (ALWAYS add chicken!) Sauces and dressings are homemade. The herbal limeade is also incredible (basil and limeade is an amazing combination). A 1/4 chicken is usually the perfect \"female\" portion, and with 2 sides its plenty of food. Prices are extremely affordable considering how fresh the food is."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken has taken over Charlotte, and that's not a bad thing.  First time to the Huntersville location where people were almost flowing out the front door as they waited to order their succulent Peruvian chicken.  My friend Allen was working in this area today and got me to make the long trek up here from South Charlotte.  When I got to the counter and ordered the Serrano Cobb salad, Olga took my order.  She is the most effervescent cashier I have ever met.  After two minutes of talking with her, I felt like I had a new best friend. If I were managing this restaurant, I would put her in a position of broader responsibility.  That Colombian lady has outstanding relational skills and Viva Chicken is lucky to have her.  If any Viva manager is reading this, please give that lady a fist bump or a pat on the back.  Another great Viva experience and I will return!"}
{"text":"I love the food at viva chicken. I always get the viva salad or 1/4 chicken with sides. The stuffed avocado is delicious too. I am giving 3 stars because it is impossible to get nutritional information. I think this is unacceptable. I hope they figure that out soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new restaurant. The food is fresh and delicious. They have a knack for putting together incredible flavors of \"good for you ingredients\" (aka REAL food): quinoa, avocado, chicken, etc. their sauces are a wonderful compliment to their dishes."}
{"text":"This is a great new option for quick, but not fast food. Menu is a little confusing and its a tad expensive, I spent $36 on lunch for three, but the quality is worth it and the dipping sauces are outstanding. This is also the first place I like the regular fries better than the sweet potato fries. The regular fries are crunchy without being burnt, not sure how they do it. 

The ambiance is very nice, reminds me of some of the trendy places I've been in Denver, CO. There is an outdoor area that is covered and warm in the winter. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our party tried a few different items on the menu.  No one liked their food, and we all agreed that the chicken was DRY!  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"We ordered the whole chicken with 3 sides. Every was fresh delicious and tons of flavor. The rice, sweet potatoes fried and cilantro rice. We came in on a BUSY Sunday and we had our food in 5 minutes. It was hot and fresh. The atmosphere is very casual and very clean. You can eat her with jeans on or on a date. The staff is very polite and the keep the tables and floor clean. It's located near Whole Foods grocery in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I am getting addicted to this place. My husband and I absolutely love it. My favorite is the Tacu bowl. I am not vegetarian but sometimes prefer to eat that way and I love that the chicken is optional on many dishes. I have eaten here several times and the service is always great and the food so flavorful and healthy."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Just ate here for my first time and already planning when I'll be able to come back!!! I have three children under the age of 12 that are picky and they all loved it too!!!! I had the fried rice dish- will order again. The sauce was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"not gunna lie, a little pricey for a rotisserie chicken.... but IT IS SO WORTH EVERY PENNY. It's so nice, clean, and environmental! The staff is GREAT. The food is what takes the real trophy though. I'm as frugal as it gets, and I'll say this place is so worth. 

Their sauces are undeniably amazing. I like to mix them all, but their spicy is the best. It has a the perfect spice level but with a lot of flavor instead of just spice like tobasco and others. 
The green sauce is the perfect corriander chutney (Very Indian, but no spices - and the flavors can tell it appreciates it's original ingredients) 

Once I got there at 10:45 and we were waiting for it to open in the car. We lost track of time and went in at 11:08 and we had 6 people in front of us."}
{"text":"Viva-Viva Chicken! 

Where I do begin?! This place is oh so good.  I no longer eat chicken but when I did-I ate here a lot. During my dietary transition I stopped eating here because I couldn't risk the temptation of that super juicy roasted chicken. I've since rekindled my flame for Viva Chicken by exploring other menu items that are vegetarian friendly. My favorite is the Tacu Bowl w/ cilantro lime rice, seasoned canary beans,  pickled onions, carrots, peas, and a generous portion of fresh sliced avocado. **You can't see me but I'm drooling right now** 
Although \"Chicken\" is featured in their name, don't be fooled, there are vegetarian options! In addition to the Tacu bowl, Viva Chicken also features a variety of salads (skip the chicken) and a wrap called the Inca wrap (its like the Tacu bowl but in a tortilla) Another fav is the quinoa stuffed avocado. Which is essentially an avocado cut in half stuffed with quinoa, red peppers, and topped with a tangy sauce. Very, very filling. I can't forget to give a shout out to the fried yuca, plantains, and fries. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Love Viva! Great customer service  My favorite is The Great on a sun-dried tomato wrap."}
{"text":"Yummy! I love Peruvian food and it hard to find. Viva Chicken is fast, fresh and quite tasty. It definitely breaks the mold from traditional Peruvian restaurants because things like wraps, quinoa and avacados. There are plenty of healthy options available. I decided on a sundried tomato wrap that included cilantro rice, beans, chicken, onions, avacado, cheese, and lettuce. Due to size of the wrap, I was only able to eat half of it. I did finish my side order of fried yucca that I dipped into two different sauces. My mom got a side order of fries, which she enjoyed. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Outside Tabletops have a funky feel to them. I thought it was just not cleaned properly but it seems that the varnish just gets sticky from being outside. As far as the chicken goes, it has a nice flavor to it. I ordered a 1/2 chicken. The breast meat was a little on the dry side. My sweet potato fries looked like they were laying around for a while. Maybe my expectations are a little too high?"}
{"text":"I tried this on my lunch break the other day and was impressed by the service and the food. I ordered the 1/4-chicken which comes with two sides. I chose the green beans, which were fantastic. They were the skinny kind with a slight blackening to them (like they were grilled perhaps) and topped with chopped tomatoes. I also got the side salad which had the most amazing creamy balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The chicken itself was extremely small but very tender and flavorful. There are three dipping sauces you can choose from if you wish; I tried the Aji Amarillo sauce because it was the most mild and it was delicious...I could drink it by the gallon! 

The atmosphere is nice and comfortable, and I enjoyed their music selections. The women's bathroom is one of the nicest I've ever seen. This is a nice option for healthier eating in the Lake Norman area, BUT the prices are a little high for me to go there very often. My meal plus a drink was almost $13 and there really wasn't a lot of food for the money. I would've given this a 5-star review had the portions been better for that kind of price."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Authentic cuisine and great service. If you leave hungry, that's your fault."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while since I've heard about the amazing sauces and their homemade juices!! It was amazing. I had the half order of quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken & side of yucca fries! More than enough food with the purple juice( forget the name) 
Husband got the steak sandwich & fries with a NODA Jam session. Both our entrees came w. Drinks came to $25 bucks! Fresh flavor & great prices. 

Will definitely be back to try other amazing food!!! Oh! And the customer service great, no complaints and very clean!!!"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying, I understand door dash is a separate ordering process from Viva Chicken. But it's absolutely ridiculous when we call Viva before our order leaves to ask for some sauce that we can't get it. Mind you, the sauce is FREE and i didn't think it would be a problem if I called to add some because I didn't see the option for it online. My Inca wrap was very dry & bland without the sauce(also forgot the avocado on my wrap). I had a few bites and in the trash it went. When you can't even call to add FREE sauce to your order its ridiculous! Management handled it poorly and I will spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is so inviting, the only thing I would change is the menus on the wall the orange background and white writing makes it a little hard to read. The food here is always amazing and comes out fresh hot and super fast! The food is also on the healthier side, so that is refreshing. This is definitely a place to try!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Great food.  Nice quick serve atmosphere.  Everything we tried was delicious. Flavor were different than what I am used to in a very good way.  We will be back again soon.   I had the arroz chaufa with chicken.  My wife had the avocado salad and 1/2 chicken with plantains and green beans.  I loved the green sauce that is like a jalapeño cilantro love child. I also tried the passion fruit juice.  Ya buddy!  I give this new chicken joint two thumbs up!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch today and MAN that was a fantastic meal. I had the Great wrap and she had the Andina Quinoa Salad (her salad was HUGE!!!). If you love chicken, this is your place."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying their chicken is just like the rotisserie chicken you can get at Harris Teeter, except that you'll have to pay more at Viva Chicken.  Besides a subtle hint of some spices and a bit of smokiness, it's pretty comparable, and way overpriced for what it is.  My friend who lives near here even says he orders their sides, gets the sauces, and then goes and buys a rotisserie chicken from Harris Teeter and feels better about the money he saved.

The sides here are pretty solid.  I enjoy the green beans and cilantro rice.  Both have good flavor and were cooked well.  The green beans still maintain a little crunch, which I appreciate.

The sauces are what makes the chicken good.  I liked both the green cilantro sauce and the red spicier sauce.  I still can't get over how underwhelming the chicken is, though.  At other Peruvian chicken places I've been to, the chicken is so tender, juicy, and flavorful that you don't need the sauce to make the chicken taste good - it's already delicious.  The sauce just adds another dimension.  At Viva Chicken, you need the sauce to make the meat taste good - there's no getting around it.

The service was friendly, and the space is nice and clean.  It's a fast-casual restaurant, and we actually called our order in ahead of time to save having to wait for our food."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  The yuca and fresh green beans are yummy.  Go early because it can get very busy.  The atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I work right next to Viva Chicken, and everyone has told me that it was amazing, so I went to try it out.

Love the atmosphere. Very warm, inviting, can be a great place to hang out. The service was also great and timely! I got my order probably 5-8 minutes after I ordered it (and this was with a crowd!). However the food was very underwhelming.

I got the fried rice bowl with chicken (I can't remember the name of it) and although it was good, I feel like it was seriously just fried rice thrown together with chicken. And the chicken was a little on the dry side, so eating this meal without water was painful. I added some of their yellow mild sauce on it though and it gave it some more flavor. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing, but I feel the meal was underwhelming, especially for almost $10."}
{"text":"Tried it for first time. Chicken too salty, sweet potato fries a bit tough, plantains good. Not excited about this place but may try it one more time and get something different. If not more impressed I'm done!"}
{"text":"extremely popular for the lunch crowd. my friend and I had to wait a few minutes for a table, but the turn over was quick so we got out food quickly too. the food was so fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"There are few authentic Peruvian spots in the area, and although I wouldn't say this is one of them, it's fairly close, at least for a chain. I got the half chicken with fried yuca and sweet plantains. The flavor of the chicken was fine enough. It was juicy and tender and I can't say I didn't enjoy it. The yuca was exquisite: well-fried and crispy enough for even my tastes. 

The sweet plantains however are the reason for the 4 star rating: they were an enormous letdown. The first batch I received was criminally undercooked. After complaining, the next batch I received (no doubt in response to the undercooking) was burnt. I imagine the fast-foodism of the restaurant didn't allow the plantains to be cooked properly; plantains have to be prepared slowly, otherwise they end up either undercooked or overcooked. 

If that is the only concern, then you know a restaurant is doing pretty well. One thing I'd like to toss in -- the sweet tea was very satisfying. Sounds silly, I know, but most places absolutely butcher sweet tea. And since that's my drug of choice, I remember the restaurants that do it well. Viva Chicken did it well. Kudos.

If you visit Viva Chicken, you'll like it, almost guaranteed. It isn't your Peruvian neighbor's grandma's cooking, but for an American chain, it's good enough."}
{"text":"Peruvian chicken finally found in Lake Norman...HERE!  It is a hot spot in Charlotte and so glad they decided to make a spot in LKN.  We love them, yes we do!

Fan favorites...quinoa stuffed avocado with the chicken is my absolute fave.  Hubs digs the arroz chaufa (think fried rice with roasted chicken, enough for two people) & they have their own sauces that he likes to mix in.    Plantains are a must & the herbal lemonade is a great choice.  Sandwiches/wraps & the 1/4 chicken options are all good, as well.  I'm well on my way to having tried the entire menu...if I can just stop ordering the avocado to get something else :|

They also serve beer & have some local pics.  The outdoor patio is a great extension to seating & is heated in the colder months.  Great location & a fairly quick meal.  Great to-go containers, so call ahead & pick-up, for a quick yummy meal!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quality of food is amazing.  Chicken is the thing to get.  All the sauces are excellent.  Yuca is like a sweeter version of a steak fry.  The corn salad is amazing. The price for the quality is good value.  You can order and pay online and pick up.  Only thing that could be better is the addition of curb side service since parking can be tight.  I would go more often if curb side pickup was offered."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a delicious price :) The service is phenomenal, and be prepared for leftovers because the portions are VERY generous!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Paleo option to take home (or dine in), there's a limit to what is available. Viva Chicken's Stuffed Avocado is a great option, and it's meant for a hearty appetite! Absolutely delicious. 
I've loved everything I've ordered. Chicken's done well, rice is a nice alternative to the usual mexican rice offered most elsewhere, and they're herbal limeade is kickin'.
I wish they had nutritional info on their site. That's why I'm holding out for the other star. I know it's a bit picky, but the squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Oh, and their Alfajores?! Expensive, only get two, but I splurge and share with my husband. Divine."}
{"text":"Delicious. The chicken is excellent and the seasonings are very authentic. One of my best friends is Peruvian and a talented cook. I am going to bring him here because I know he will enjoy it!

The sangria was also very good."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorites. Amazing flavor and plenty of food. We live an hour away and crave Viva chicken regularly. There just isn't anything quite like it."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place I was ready for a fantastic meal. My daughter and wife frequent this place on a regular basis. I decided to give it a try tonight for the first time. I  ordered one of the chicken wraps. Unfortunately the chicken was extremely dry. If it were not for the delicious sauces, I probably would not have eaten the wrap. The sweet potato fries were nothing special. After all of the hype, my overall experience was just OK. It's not the worst food I've ever eaten, nor is it the best. I will give it a try another day and just chalk it up to  one bad night."}
{"text":"Great new options for the Huntersville area, the chicken stuffed avocado is off the chain good.  I especially like the green herbal lemonade as well."}
{"text":"A good place to grab a meal then head to Whole Foods to shop sensibly. It was very busy on a weeknight around 730p. I had the quarter chicken meal with a sangria. The chicken choice is either white or dark. I tried the white and I got a whole breast and wing. It was delicious! Moist, tender and well seasoned. To some people, I can see the chicken being too salty. I liked it and I would definitely order it again. The meal comes with two sides - I had the fries (the battered kind so I know they're bought) and green beans (soy and ginger maybe?) Overall, the meal got expensive with the sangria but it was large and strong enough to be worth it. Give them a chance!"}
{"text":"I love trying different kinds of fare and this Peruvian chicken joint did not disappoint. It was amazing! The sides are the real winners, whereas the chicken is just alright. They offer three different gourmet sauces to accompany your dishes and I think all three are quite delicious. I recommend the Tuca bowl. They serve large portions! The combinations of flavors in the bowl were magnificent and hit the spot just right. Their plantains are very sweet but scrumptious. I recommend trying this place if you have never had Peruvian food before. My husband had a rotisserie chicken ciabatta sandwich and it was very delicious. I would definitely come back here but I wouldn't be a regular, if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"Great Americanized Peruvian place! Their chicken is always delicious and they are always consistent with that. French fried and awesome and their stuffed avocados, wow!! Don't care too much for their classic beef saltado in comparison to other VC locations. This location's beef is too chewy, not the best. Other than that, I don't mind paying too much for a bottle of their Peruvian soft drink \" Inca-Kola\" food just tastes better with it."}
{"text":"Viva la Pollo (Chicken) forever. I've had peruvian chicken from a variety of places and most are flavorful but also heavily brined/salty. Not the case here. This was probably the most fresh peruvian chicken I've had and even better there is an endless supply of green, yellow and red pepper sauce. I ordered a 1/4 chicken with the fried yucca and organic canary bean (I could even tasted the organic!!). There wasn't as much yucca as I expected but it was good. I added a blend of the green and red pepper sauce to spice it up a little. Colonel who? I wish there was a Viva chicken in Maryland. The customer service I got was only okay, the cashier seemed a little blah but no big deal."}
{"text":"Something magical exists in the quinoa this place makes!  The menu always seemed confusing to us for some reason and it kept us from visiting for far too long.  Once we got some recommendations from acquaintances on how to order plant based here, we dove in and were very pleased! The quinoa stuffed avocado was a standout to us, we also enjoyed our power salad - splitting the two dishes between the two of us worked well as the lettuce around the stuffed avocado was a little sparse for our veggie lover needs.  The restaurant was nicely decorated and clean, and overall we really enjoyed our meal.  (Seriously though, how do y'all do that quinoa?!)"}
{"text":"The best chicken dining experience that I've ever had!!! I ordered the naked Peruvian sandwich in a sundried tomato wrap (added rotisserie chicken) and chose the quinoa as the side. HUGE PORTIONS! Added a fountain drink... all of this for $13 and some change! So fresh! Everyone working was very helpful and knowledgeable of the products being served. Took a few bites of the tres leches cake that my mom ordered. I was super disappointed that I didn't order one for myself! Do yourself a flavor and eat here!! You won't regret it!! Can't wait for the Concord location to open!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is great choice for a healthier meal and delicious food. The chicken is very flavorful and then whole chicken, with two sides (cilantro rice/soltarito) is great for a family of 3! They also have a delicious chicken soup that is sooo good. I love to get the soup, when it is cold or if you are not feeling well."}
{"text":"Healthy quick food, not fast food, with very tasty sauces you must try...spicy & flavorful, not to burn your mouth. My favorite is the quinoa stuffed avocado on a salad. They kind of skimped on the salad my last visit but the chicken wraps were delicious. And you must try one of their unique, refreshing drinks like the mango fruit juice or my favorite, the basil/mint \"tea\". They're super sweet so I water them down. Nice patio area in season too. Great value & quick enough for lunch."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat!!!! The food is so delicious. Everything I try is so stinking fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is one of our FAVORITE places to eat in Charlotte. With a family of 4 on a budget we can get healthy, delicious food that we can afford. I came to the Huntersville location for dinner with a friend last night and we had the very best service. We met the lovely Tatyana, who inadvertently introduced us to the table next to us while she was talking about the sopa de pollo and we spent the rest of the evening making new friends!! Everyone we interacted with were fantastic- cheerful, friendly, engaging, and professional. Highly recommend this location and any of their locations in charlotte! -Katie A"}
{"text":"This franchise has been rapidly expanding throughout Charlotte over the past few years, and for good reason. I have enjoyed every visit and have yet to try a menu item I didn't like. Great for carry-out on busy nights as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both of their Charlotte/LKN locations and the food is delicious. I get the Naked Peruvian wrap (it's vegetarian) and it's awesome. Their sauces are amazing too, I dream about this food, seriously. I go with plenty of meat eaters and they all seem to love what they get as well. Lots of people have said the quinoa stuffed avocado is good too."}
{"text":"A solid 4 for this location because it's new and always so dang crowded. Hard to compare to other sites still because they are still getting their act together. Had Chifa and it was good. I got the Great which was tasty and big but they had run out of yucca fries. No Soltado .. Overly overly crowded with a long wait .. Experience was ok overall if you didn't mind all the kids running around"}
{"text":"Went to visit this place for the very first time and I was surprisingly happy with the great customer service I was provided. I can't remember his name but I told him it was my first time visiting and that I did not eat chicken but I noticed the steak options. He didn't criticize me or say anything about me coming to a place that was mainly a chicken place and not eating chicken, he was very polite. He made a few suggestions and recommendations for me and had some good ideas. He was just really nice. Then he offers me some samples of the juice on display which was very tasty. My first experience was very good and I know this will not be my last visit since the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in huntersville I love the chicken, the sauces, the sides this location has better service and food than the one in near uptown"}
{"text":"The food is so damn good and the service is friendly. Inca wrap with or without chicken, tacu bowl, salads.... Green beans, yucca, plantains.... Herbal lemonade... The sauces.... All of it is so scrumptious!"}
{"text":"So much good food every single time. Never disappointed. One order of rice and chicken leaves plenty of tasty leftovers for the next day, although our son always tries to beat us to it! A forever regular at our house. It's on the menu for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Very good! We are on a road trip and found this place on Yelp. We have spent time in Peru and while most of the things we tried didn't taste like what we ate in Peru, it was delicious. We had the Inca wrap with chicken and plantains on the side. We also shared an order of the Quinoa stuffed avocado which was amazing. My daughter had The Great wrap and she said it lives up to its name. The sauces were great and we tried them all. We also ordered maracuya juice and if anything we had in Peru, this was authentic. The Herbal lime juice was also a blast of flavor."}
{"text":"Customer service was wonderful! Food portions kind of small but everything seemed fresh and healthy. The purple juice is amazing. Hard to manuver through since they were so crowded and no recommended for families with children that have strollers."}
{"text":"Wow! The food here is excellent! I had the Peruvian Chicken, plantains, and solterito (this salad is a must try!!). The chicken was hot and had heat flavor. The plantains were sweet and cooked well. The solterito was flavor-packed and do delicious. I felt like I had wait service, their employee Maria was so kind and she went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed. Their collection of sauces was excellent, but the chicken was also good on its own. The decor was clean, stylish, and inviting. They have an environmentally friendly mission, which is a +++. I was so happy with my visit. I'm hooked. I wish there were even more locations. I'll be back soon. Do yourself a favor, ditch traditional wait service and enjoy this delicious counter to table flavor-packed eatery."}
{"text":"I would like to first disclaim that I am not huge on pulled chicken...  
That said, the quinoa stuffed avocado is AMAZING (and a half of one is super filling!), as are their sauce options!  My husband loves their wraps.  I find the food a bit pricey but I guess for fresh food, one should not expect things to be much cheaper.  I like the inside of Viva chicken as its your typical fast casual restaurant and they have a nice outdoor seating area.
Like I said.... I'm not huge on their chicken, but I can get down with some of their other options!"}
{"text":"What a treat this place is!  I have never had a bad meal here and their sauces are amazing.  My favorite side is the avocado w/ quinoa.  So much to chose from on this menu.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"After my second visit, it remains at 4 stars. This trip was far from a home run, though. It began with my son waiting five minutes for the bathroom, only to watch a female employee exit the Men's room. Then it took 19 minutes for us to get our food (we timed it). And my food was barely warm. On top of that, the fruit salad is 85% apples; don't expect grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew. It looks like they're more focuses on margins than customer satisfaction in regards to the fruit salad. 

You might be wondering why the 4 stars. It's simply because the food was good. However, it's still a generous rating. I got the quarter-dark chicken. Since it's free-range chicken, the serving size is small. That's fine, but not when the price is so high. On the positive side, they replaced my barely-warm chicken without me asking (they overheard me). And the restaurant is spacious and comfortable. There is also outside dining. 

I think the timing was just a little off here because the food is  very good. Hence the 4 stars. Will update again next time."}
{"text":"I moved here from the West Coast where we do not have a Viva chicken. I can't believe I have missed so many years of my life without trying this food! They have really mastered salads and being able to add complex and flavorful taste to their salads. They are extremely filling and you will not be disappointed. I usually get the Cobb salad with chicken. It's so good! I have ordered it multiple times and it's always tasted the same if not better each time. Also, their chicken soup is absolutely delicious. It taste homemade and it's packed with a lot of flavor. If you still have room to eat after the salad you should definitely get the plantains. They are delicious and can act as a side or small dessert after! This place always has me coming back! I love it here!"}
{"text":"Had the 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice and green beans. Very good! The service is amazing! My pickup order was fast. Ordered and received food in like 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to find a restaurant with amazing good and healthy food. Very fast and convenient. I love this place! Great quality food."}
{"text":"This Viva has a cool vibe though I'm clearly too old for the music. Place is clean with attentive staff, especially Ali at the cash register."}
{"text":"Okay. Let me start by saying, I love Pio Pio in Dilworth. I have some friends who have had bad experiences there with service but I never have (it's worth noting that no one I know has had bad experiences with their food but I will save that for a review of Pio Pio). 

Now, I first went to the Viva Chicken near CPCC with some friends. I wasn't wowed by it but didn't hate it. I just felt like I got better food at Pio Pio. 

My boyfriend and I went to the Huntersville location recently for him to try (as he is also a Pio Pio fan). I ordered the Great Wrap, which was bland without the sauces. I had sweet potato fries and liked them a lot. 

My boyfriend had the 1/2 chicken with rice and beans. His rice was undercooked and hard but he liked the beans. As for the chicken, he liked the seasoning on it a lot. 

For dessert, we shared a churro. He loved it. I thought it was just okay. But that makes sense because he typically likes sweeter things than me. 

In comparison with Pio Pio- we think Pio Pio has better chicken and felt like we got more value for our money considering the sides that come with a meal at Pio Pio. We think that Viva Chicken is winning in the decor area, as well as the self serve sauces. 

In conclusion, we still prefer Pio Pio but are not opposed to coming back to Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"Best Chicken you can get in the area.  Amazing Sauces! Wonderful Sides! Some of the best sweet potato fries I have had ever. White or Dark meat you cannot go wrong here and they even do To Go."}
{"text":"Thank you!! Just want to shout out to the staff and manager for taking care of business tonight with poise, kindness, and politeness. Part of my order was left out of my take-out order and they made up for everything 100% despite  a packed house. And to top it all off, our meal was incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Two words: Arroz Chaufa. The Peruvian Fried Rice with chicken is the BEST fried rice I've ever had! It's cooked perfectly every time and pairs perfectly with the Aji Amarillo sauce. It's also a hefty portion, which means I always have enough for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Wish we had discovered Viva Chicken sooner than we did.
Wife and I love Peruvian chicken and Viva Chicken did not disappoint!
Wife got the 1/4 dark and I the 1/4 white. Now I have never been to Peru so I can't say if its \"authentic\" Peruvian chicken but I can tell you it's damn good chicken!! I mean clean the bone and leave no scrap of meat behind good! Moist, tender and very flavorful and we love the Peruvian spices.
Sides were good as well. I got the canary beans and plantains, wife the sweet potato fries and fruit cup.
Wife skipped the sauces, but I tried all three.The yellowish one had a honey mustard flavor that I was not a fan of, the green one was heavy on the cilantro with a little heat and the \"Gringo Killer\" was not as hot as I expected, but both were a nice compliment to the chicken.
Mostly self-service but we were checked on during our meal to make sure everything was ok.
Got out for a very reasonable $21 and change.
Plates and silverware are all eco friendly and compostable which is a big thumbs up with my wife and I and I can't believe someone actually gave this place a bad review because of that!
I see many more visits to Viva Chicken in our future."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the staffs are all friendly. Come early cause it fills up quick especially during lunch time and the line can get extremely long. It's not only delicious especially their sauces but it's healthy and supports local farms. Every item on the menu is good and the green cilantro sauce is my fav. It's great on everything."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, healthy food FAST! Viva Chicken is great. My favorite thing to get is the quinoa stuffed avocado. Amazing!

The last time we came here, a lazy employee said they didn't have an allergen list or way to know their ingredients. Ugh! But... today we came back and asked a manager and they DO have one. I'm posting the photo of the menu here.

The food is fast, fresh and so tasty! And, they CAN accommodate allergies. No matter what your diet restrictions are, they can make you a delicious meal for dine in or to go."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy! Man, I love this place because you can eat healthy and unhealthy at the SAME time! Nice polite staff and great food. I got the 1/2 chicken and sweet potato fries and green beans. All very juicy and tasty. 

The sauces were alright- wish I had tried the hottest one. The green medium sauce was really good! Will totally come back here every month or so, not sure if I'd make it a regular stop. But other options looked delicious too. 

They had sangria and I really wanted some. Their juices looked good too. 

Loved the club music they were playing. Like a family place with a hip spin on it!"}
{"text":"Place was very very clean! Service was as expected. Food to me is not to die for. I have visited several locations in Charlotte, the very first time I tried it my co-worker wife brought some to the job and I tried it and it was good. Second time I tried it was okay and this was the third time and it was worse. Each location I have visited was jam packed so I am sure it's just my taste buds cause I am a very picky eater LoL. With that being said it's worth trying for yourself however if you go especially during lunch be prepared for the crowd. After my experience someone sent me a message stating they where going to mail me coupons to come eat free to give the restaurant another shot. The message was sent in here (Yelp), I never got the coupons after sending the person my address. I messaged them back twice telling them I never received the coupons and now they won't respond. 

Update: After I updated my review in regards to the message I received about the coupon to eat free that I never got I was contacted by the Marketing Manager (Brenda) she apologized that I never received the coupon to eat free which I was promised. I then went back to my messages and discovered that the original message promising the free food was sent by one of the owners (Randy G). Brenda promised she would send me a gift card and to my surprise she followed through on her word. The gift card arrived in the mail for $5. The $5 kinda took me by surprise because last I checked free meant free not to mention they have nothing on their menu for $5. Not only that but as far as I am concerned from a customer service stand point when you try get a customer to give you a second chance you don't do it by paying for some of the meal and asking the customer to give you more money! So I decided to send Brenda a message and her response was they wanted to give me a gift, whatever that means. Never the less I decided to give the restaurant a second chance. I went around 2pm today 8/24/17, the restaurant was not crowed however I ordered mines to go. It took about ten to fifteen minutes to receive my food. Durning that time about 4 employees walked past and not 1 of them smiled or said hi to me or the other customers waiting beside me. I would say they definitely have some work to do on the customer service side.  Once home I dug into the food, and OMG let me tell you it was GOOD! It was 200% better than the last time, so for that I will say thank you! In conclusion let me say next time be of your word and do as you promised when you promise, work on the friendliness and customer service of your staff, the speediness of your service and keep up the good work in the kitchen! The chicken and chicken soup are both to die for! Again please allow me to say thank you! 

Update: So after my last visit everything was great except for the customer service. After I posted a review Brenda (there marketing representative) reached out to me yet again and asked me to give it another try. She stated she would send me another gift card this time enough to get a meal without having to add any of my own money LoL. First let me say Brenda did just that, she is by far a person of her word! I will say this time the food was amazing as last time only this time the service was better. In fact so much better I went to a different location in the same week. I will say Viva Chicken is definitely making there mark with food because I have never been to any of there restaurants and it was empty. While like all other places they are not perfect and still have some work to do, they are on the right track. Not to forget they not only want to earn your business but also keep it. Often times when customers are not given the service we might think we should be given we sit quietly. I encourage everyone to speak up and let your voice be heard, because often times managers/ owners don't even know if you don't tell them. It's only fair you say something and give them a chance to make it right that being said you can count on Viva Chicken making it right. Yes I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great chicken great prices.  Fast causal, like a chipotle of great Peruvian rotisserie chicken. Lots of sides that are really good as well. Most importantly some great Peruvian flavors.  Be sure to get their sauces and put them on  the rotisserie chicken.... super good!"}
{"text":"The Peruvian Chicken is excellent BUT you must add the 
Aji sauce.  Peruvian Chicken without Aji Amarillo sauce is a crime against humanity.  When you walk in the door, the secret of this restaurant is just to the left in those little magical dispensers of saucy baaaaboom - e -ness with their home made Aji, and Ricotto sauces.   You must, not do what one of the previous reviewers said that the \"chicken needed more spices\".  The poor woman came here for the first time and did not have someone to show her the way.   Put the Aji Amirillo on your Chicken.  Put it on your Rice.  Put it on your stuffed Avacado (their top seller).  Heck, ask for a cup for water and drink the stuff.  But do not think it is just the place to get just your forks.  It is an altar to the Incan's and their cooking mastery.  

Try the sweet potato fries (Peru is where god invented the potato and they have over 1000 varieties, you should go there and just eat as it is some of the best food in the world.....)

Bring an empty bottle and squirt some in there and stuff it in your pockets - The Aji Sauce.  Bring it home and put it on your eggs in the morning or on a sandwich.  It is made from Aji peppers, 2% condensed milk, a few saltines, and some salt."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken. Which they had more side optiosn but love teh taste of the chicken."}
{"text":"My second time at Viva Chicken.  I'm constantly struggling to find decent quick food that is on the healthier side, but notice my area has its fill of burger, pizza, and fried chicken places.   Trying to find a place with a little variety other than the usual options is a nice change.
My sister introduced me to this place, so I could stop cramming my face hole with pizza and burgers.  I am glad that she did because this has been a great place.  Frankly, all the usual chain places have worn thin.
I like the freshness of this place.  For this meal, I had \"The Great\" and added avocado.  Along with the wrap, you get a side, and I chose sweet potato fries.  All this for under 9 bucks plus tax.  It's the same price as getting a greasy burger and fries at other restaurants.
My meal was really good.  I found my way to the sauces and made a nice mixture of the yellow and green sauces.  This made a nice amount of extra zingy tang.  The sweet potato fries were not over salted, which is good for my ticker, and by the time I finished everything, I was comfortably full.
I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I've always seen this place poppin' so I had to check it out when me and coworker were in the area. We came in the awkward after lunch but before dinner time and it was still pretty crowded. 

My coworker ordered the 1/4 chicken with rice and salad. I ordered the Sopa de Pollo. I had no idea that I essentially ordered chicken rice soup. I guess that's what I get for taking French in high school and not Spanish. Regardless, it was good. And when I say good, I mean I ate it all. Won't write home about it but I'm not even mad. My coworker enjoyed her meal.

The only issue with me and its personal preference is that the chicken either isn't seasoned at all or is lightly seasoned. I needed more flavor. I needed a Pop, some Shazam, something and I didn't get that.

Price points are solid for the high quality. It's good, clean food. Not heavy or greasy but overall filling. 

Staff is super nice. If you dine in, they bring you your food. I also got a drink re-fill from staff. Utensils, sauces, and napkins are self-serve so don't forget those. 

The eating area is huge and they have an adjacent patio outside. The bathroom, while it being an individual bathroom, is beautiful and clean."}
{"text":"This place is great. I ordered online and my order was ready when I walked in. The cashier confirmed that everything was in the bag and I was in the store for no more than 30 seconds. The chicken was great as were the sides."}
{"text":"I really liked the yucca fries and green beans. I'll be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is the place to go for a quick, healthy, and satisfying meal. I have been there for lunch several times and I've always had a good experience. I usually get the Tacu bowl and add their rotisserie chicken. Their rotisserie chicken is moist and very flavorful. The Tacu bowl also includes rice, beans, and pickled onions, so there are a lot of flavors going on. They offer 3 different sauces so that you can customize your meal and make it more spicy, more herbaceous, or more mild.
I am obsessed with their herbal limeade. If the meal gets too spicy, the herbal limeade has your back to cool it down. As far as fast casual restaurants go, Viva Chicken is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Tried Viva for the first time today. I ordered a 1/4 white with the green beans, cilantro rice, and iced tea. The first question I had to ask myself when the young lady delivered the plate and I saw the cute little breast with the wing attached was - is that from a 'bantam chicken' or a 'cornish game hen'?! Good Lord what a small chicken that must have been!

The flavor of all three items was very good. The sauteed green beans were not over cooked but still slightly crunchy - excellent. The cilantro rice was well cooked and not soggy, again - very good. The chicken had a nice rotisserie moist flavor but like I said it was VERY small! TOO SMALL! But the size of the sides made up for that and I left satisfied.

Was it worth the $12.75 price tag including the $.75 all-white up-charge and iced tea? For me, after looking around at what people were eating at the other tables the arroz chaufa will be my next selection.

The tiny little piece of chicken cost them a star. The high price another. If it wasn't for that I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food!
Salads were fresh. The chicha great! I have peruvian friends and this place is authentic flavors. Dip the fries in the green and yellow sauce."}
{"text":"After moving to Davidson a year ago, there are a few places that have become staples for us. Viva Chicken is one of those places. We try to find restaurants that provide both healthy options, and convenience, and Viva provides both. It's always packed, but you get through the line quickly, and get your food quickly.

My favorites are the 1/4 Chicken Meal, the Andina Power Salad, or the Great Wrap with avocado. All of these are healthy options that taste great.

The staff has always been great, and the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious it is beyond description.  Loved the chicken and the plantains. So very fresh not at all greasy. Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great \"healthy\" food option for someone watching what they eat. I always get the 1/2 chicken 2 sides. I have yet to find a side that I didn't like. They have a few beers to choose from along with wine. Their homemade sauces are amazing. Try mixing the red and yellow together."}
{"text":"What can I say about viva chicken that is already not said! Amazing food, quick and the chicken is a must try. 

Quick service and all around good place to be."}
{"text":"Chicken is great! Some of the sides are kinda weird and taste weird. But I do love the cilantro rice. I wish they had more of a vegetable option for a side like just a normal one besides green beans. Please bring back the Asian chicken salad!"}
{"text":"The LKN version of Viva Chicken was long awaited and it felt like it took forever from the time we saw construction start to when it finally opened. Worth the wait?  You bet!

Chicken marinated in Peruvian spices and rotisserie grilled over charcoal to juicy perfection is a damn good start and there are plenty of tasty sides to boot. The thing that totally pushes it over the top are the sauces from which you can choose. There are degrees of difference in flavor and heat level but I think all of them are delicious and I tend to bring extra home to use as a dip for things we have in our fridge. 

It's nice to have Viva so close for quick and pretty healthy dinners when no one at home feels like cooking and their online ordering feature works well, making things even easier."}
