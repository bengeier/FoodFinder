{"text":"I wanted to check this place out after reading all the great reviews. I didn't know if this was the best choice seeing all the other sandwiches but my mouth was watering thinking of the shrimp po boy I had last summer in Florida. Glad I took a chance it was awesome! Great tasting shrimp, breading was light, the bread was soft & delicious. Onion rings were great as well. Can't wait to order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp basket and it was a huge disappointment. Beyond salty and slightly burned shrimps with soggy and flavorless fries."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich we've had.   Great service and very reasonable pricing....plan for leftovers."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, the food takes a little while so I recommend ordering in advance."}
{"text":"New sandwich shop in town!  Seriously good eats...tasty, reasonable prices, friendly proprietor...support local!   Only thing missing was a soda fountain...but for the food I'll deal!"}
{"text":"Very good music... extremely generous portion!!! Ordered the Cobb salad and had enough for dinner!will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So happy me and a couple of friends found this place yesterday! truly bomb food with a lot of options and really gives off the New York vibe. They had amazing customer service, especially those two kids in the front who always made sure everything was going good and are always trying to take care of you. 10/10 definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Just got off plane we were hungry & found Outta Bronx was close by to Sky Harbor Parking lot. They just opened. Lots of different sandwiches & sides choices. We ordered The Cowboy hot sandwich & the Corner Beef Reuben hot sandwich, BG (butter garlic) fries & fried pickles. Quick service & food was fresh & hot, especially the fries - we hate cold fries! Sandwiches were really good so were fries & pickles. Lot of food. Only negatives was Reuben bread fell apart & it was a little warm in there (but they had just opened) other than that it was worth the stop. Will do it again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We've had the a few different sandwiches as well as wings and BG fries. I do think the wings are great and the BG fries are amazing the chopped cheese is good. The Empire steak was amazing. The only thing is I think the hot sandwiches are better than the cold ones I had the Bronx club and that was alright but no wow factor like with some of the other sandwiches. I do like how accommodating they are when Kids are concerned; I was able to ask for one of our buffalo wings with no sauce for the little one no issue."}
{"text":"Want real east coast food then this is the spot for you... Great service very clean and the staff rocks  Best New York style sandwiches hands down!!! Great work outta Bronx you nailed it... Keep serving up those delicious dishes"}
{"text":"I went here after landing in the Phoenix airport.  I have missed hot sandwiches since leaving the east coast, but this place was spot on.  I ordered the Cali Chick and fries.  The tender chicken was cooked right on with onions, and the baguette offered great texture to the melty cheese.  The fries were almost shoestring and nicely salted.  I will definitely go back as they had a ton of both hot and cold options.  I also noticed there were also several large salads on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here and I wasn't disappointed. Yelp said to try it out and they were spot on. They told me I just missed the rush so food came in 5 minutes. Guy taking order at the front was very friendly.  I ordered the Empire Steak and it was awesome! Very reasonable pricing too. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.  There is a big lot in the back that could be parking and just walk around to the front. 7 tables to eat at but people were coming in for to go orders while I was eating you might consider that."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and friendly owner. Good place to go for lunch, I recommend the empire stake sandwich."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some friends. The menu looked good with a huge variety. 

Went there, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall. The interior is clean. The staff was very nice and attentive. The portions were good sized. We ordered wings, pastrami fries, Reuben and a Cobb salad. Will definitely return. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Service takes way too long. Food was good and a bit overpriced for its location. It is a let down that they only sell can sodas. This is just an okay place to eat. Just eat Del Taco instead if your in the area."}
{"text":"Co-worker told me about this place so decided to try it. I'm so glad I did. It is so delicious. I got the pastrami fries and the chopped cheese sandwich AMAZING!!! I literally feel so full as of right now but I will be back soon for sure! The staff was super friendly and loved the decor! Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"This was a really nice place to eat with great hospitality from the owner!! I forgot what I ate, because it was several months ago, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"After moving from New York/ New Jersey last year, i struggled to find food that i enjoyed and reminded me of home. This place opened up, and i immediately told Hubby that we must go. We had \"The Cowboy\" and \"Chopped Cheese\" and all i can say is \"AMAZING\". we also had Philly Cheese Steak fries which were great as well. Definitely will be coming back. & they also have great customer service which is big for me."}
{"text":"Shroomy Swiss. Brisket is perfect. Get your fix homies. People are chill and they got bangers playing on the speakers."}
{"text":"Healthy eating be damned. This place is fantastic. The best (probably only) chopped cheese in town. The pastrami fries are awesome as well. The owner is really nice and made sure my picky 4 year old got something he liked. Absolutely worth the drive down from Arrowhead."}
{"text":"They might have been KICKED OUTTA the Bronx!  6 small over seasoned frozen prepared shrimp for around $10 on top of bland unseasoned as in not even salt french fries..? Then their chopped cheese which they promoted as one of their best sandwiches was soggy bread from the tomatoes and again no flavor or season to the sandwich.  A little salt could have been the start.  Not even having a soda fountain machine?  Very disappointed in this place!!  I'm an East Coast native who ate many a delicious meal in the Bronx and other suburbs... I hope this place gets its act together and figures out their food recipes or they won't last... Phoenix does not need another bland wannabe but seriously falls short NY Style by name aline eatery!  I will be back at least once as I hope the food was a fluke one time major faux pas!!"}
{"text":"My family & I had dinner at this place on Friday night & IT WAS AMAZING!!!  Service was incredible!  They are very nice & the cook even asked if everything was good.  We had their Baja fries and chili fries, delicious and their portions were big.  I had their shrimp po boy, shrimps were big.  Their food was hot and tasted so fresh.  Don't matter where you live in the Valley - we drove from the East Valley, take a drive to OUTTA BRONX, it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I started coming here a little over a week ago. The Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich is delicious and should be named the Colossal Shrimp Po'Boy Sandwich. The onion rings and fries are excellent as well. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and professional. I've already recommended this spot to my friends for the excellent food and service. 

Kevin"}
{"text":"We ordered the fish and chips and a chicken Caesar salad. Luckily the salad was huge and standard because the fish and chips were terrible. 2 dense soggy pieces of fish atop soggy fries. May go back to try a sandwich because the bread that came with the salad was the best part."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had in my life! I got the empire steak - it was so good I couldn't stop eating it when I got full. The sandwiches are quite large, very filling, and soooo tasty! 
I was staying at an airport hotel when I stumbled on this place while looking for places that offer pick-up service. If I'm ever in Phoenix again, I'll make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"I had the fatstack sandwich. It was huge! It was also one of the tastiest sandwiches I have ever had! I was talking to the owner while waiting for my order when he told me that their bread is made on premises. At first I thought he might be just blowing smoke, but when I started eating the sandwich, it was clear that the bread was super fresh and full of flavor. Like it was freshly baked. I was very impressed!
One tip, the portions of fries are huge!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? First off the food is amazing, I had the shrimp po boy which was odd the charts. The service is great I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. I have had the chopped cheese and Long Island sandwiches thus far. Both of them had fresh bread and delicious contents. The wings are very good as well and I consider myself to be a wing snob! I am lucky I no longer dabble in the devils lettuce or I would be here every day. Don't let the location fool you it is top notch."}
{"text":"Update: have been back a couple times as this is right in my neighborhood, and they are really starting to get into a groove. Balance in the sandwiches was much better, and the service has settled in to being darn good. 

Definitely worth trying if you like East Coast style sandwiches. 



Will give this place another try, but wasn't terribly impressed. 

Went a few weeks after it opened, and they were clearly still working on the details. No soda fountain, and the drinks they had in a cooler were room temp. Cooler won't ever really work in this joint - too busy. Ordering took a while, lid behind the counter was alone and being asked to handle too much at once. Couldn't find any ketchup for fries. Or napkins. Eventually got the latter, not the former. 

Food prep was quick - a plus. 

Food was ok, not great. I expect these types of sandwiches to be heavy, but mine was totally overloaded w mayo - flavor drowning amounts. The meat seemed to be good quality, just got slathered to death."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. This place is amazing. They didnt have an item I had been wanting to try on the menu that day but the manager allowed the cook to make it for me...great customer service,great food, an everyone is friendly an down to earth. Plus they play good music. No one would understand a place like this if they weren't down to earth themselves. Love this place an will be back more than often."}
{"text":"Ordered food via Grubhub. Got the shrimp poboy and the shroomy beef sandwich. Both were delicious.  The fried pickles were so so;  overall, I had a great dinner and enough for leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"I had the Philly cheese steak sandwich which was excellent. The meat and vegetables were not too large, they were nice size pieces so every bite had something in it. The bread was very good too. Parking lot was small, but that can't be helped. Service was very friendly"}
{"text":"This place was very good. The people working were super nice and bi-lingual. Good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"There are precious few places in the Phoenix area to get a truly LUSCIOUS GRILLED sandwich. Outta Bronx will satisfy that craving for a  Philly Cheese Steak, Italian Beef or Reuben or Chicken Parm with meat piled high and cheese and sauce oozing out of the sides and down your forearms!!! Mountains of French Fries drenched in cheese and chili like you only see at a state fair! THE BEST place to go if you have the munchies! I can't believe someone here wrote a review with the word \"ambience\" in it. LOL! The place itself is like a spartan pizzeria with about 10 tables but CLEAN. Very depressed neighborhood and not the most upscale clientele, but seems to be safe (No one bothered my car). As noted elsewhere, the owner is very sweet, proud of his shop and will do his best to please you. If you understand there is authenticity and joy in some greasy foods, this is the ultimate expression of that guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"I found this little gem while looking for a new restaurant on yelp and voila--Outta Bronx, came up! I scrolled through the pictures and looked at the menu and I was in! It's located in a busy, small strip mall with very limited parking. The guy that took our order was friendly and helpful. My boyfriend ordered the Hot Beef and I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and a basket of the garlic Parmesan fries. Its a small restaurant with two cooks on the grill, so our order of two sandwiches and fries took a little over 30 minutes. But it was worth the wait! The Shrimp Po' Boy was the best Shrimp sandwich I've ever had! My boyfriend also loved his Hot Beef. The fries were ok. I didn't care for the garlic oil because it completely soaked the fries, making them soggy; not crispy. However, we came back the next day and ordered the same sandwiches with their regular fries and they were perfection! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband has been bugging me to try this place. Today, we finally did. Location: The restaurant front shines like a new penny in the dingy and dilapidated surrounding, complete with alcoholic wanderers.

Despite the shady surroundings and the empty interior, we went in. No one was at the counter and it was hot as hell inside. Once we finally ordered, he an Empire Steak, I a Reuben and an order of Big Tex fries to share they tell me they are out of marble rye for the Reuben, wow. So I get it with the French baguette. 

They don't have fountain drinks,  despite a fountain machine behind the counter, so we get 2 cans of Pepsi at $1 each. 

We sit down, sweating to death as we wait for our meal. She brings out the fries, and my husband has one, I stick my fork in and she comes to grab our plate and states, \"this isn't your order\". Apparently,  it belonged to a person waiting for a to go order. Jesus. 

The fries were ok,  the sandwhiches were ok,  nothing to rave about.

Certainly nothing to sweat to death for."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow!  The food was frickin phenomenal. We were there early on a Sunday morning so the place was almost empty. The owner Aziz took the time to get to know us and after he found that we had driven up from Florence to check out his deli and couldn't make up our minds he offered plenty of suggestions, and when we still couldn't decide said not to worry, he'd do half samples of orders so we could check things out.

The pizza fries were pretty good but the Big Tex fries were amazing.  The entire time we ate the owner kept checking back to see how we were doing, and he was a great guy to talk to.  But again ... the food was AMAZING!!!  

I told him I'd be back to try more as it's a good day trip up on my motorcycle and my wife punched me for suggesting I'd go without her."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place through yelp. The portions are huge and the food was great. Also, the customer service was awesome. We'll definitely be back to try the rest of of the menu."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint!  Flying in from out of town I decided that I needed a good hearty lunch.  A quick google search led me to this small restaurant.   I ordered the Fatstack sandwich which is thinly sliced beef, all beef hot link, melted American, Swiss, and pepper jack cheese, crispy fries, coleslaw, and spicy mayo on a buttery French baguette.  For a little extra I got on order of the Baja Fries which is grilled chicken, melted jalapenos, jack cheese, grilled bell peppers, onions, and jalapenos with spicy aioli over crispy fries.  Both entrees were amazing.  The pictures do not do this food justice, the taste is much better that the look.  Which to me is the most important thing anyway.  Although this place is a 30 minute drive from where I live I would definitely make the trip just to eat there.  This place did not disappoint, great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Super good po' boy. The fired pickles and fries are good too. Place is a bit huddle but well worth it. Staff are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First time here-- heard about it from my Phoenix jeweler who is from the Bronx.  
Ordered 2 Fatstack's on a baguette which comes with the works.  Lots of meat and cheese in, a hot link, and even French fries inside the sandwich.  At 9.50 I thought it was a bit high but after seeing the sandwich, I would understand why.  I also ordered a $4 side of fries which was a waste.  Very barely fried (pale) and the seasoning that was supposed to be on it was barely there.  I kicked myself for ordering them.  If the sandwiches already come with fries inside, why the extra fries?  But those are my sons, always wanting extra stuff when momma is paying.  

The place was spit-shine clean (pardon the Bronx words) with classic white subway tiles.  The guy taking my order was friendly and gave me a cup of ice water on a hot day.  

The neighborhood is a little rough especially with the large liquor store a few doors down.  When I came out, two men were near my car and when I approached, they asked me where my battery was located (it is a foreign car).  I asked them why they needed to know that.  They claimed that there was a woman in the liquor store who had the same car but didn't know where her battery was located.  (Yeah, right).  I quickly scooted out of there with my two delicious sandwiches and mediocre french fries."}
{"text":"This place is great! East coast grub at its finest! The baja chicken chicken is melt in your mouth! George was phenomenal and his basketball knowledge was on point as well haha. Highly recommend this place if you like good sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Ordered via Grub Hub... came early, still hot! We had the wings, a pastrami Reuben and the fried chicken sandwich. All were great! Our new favorite GH sandwich place!"}
{"text":"I went here earlier today for the first time. I asked the girl at the register if they had any burgers. I had been sick with the flu and haven't been able to eat any real food lately... And really had a taste for a burger. A burger. She named off three things that were most closest to a Burger which were the pizza burger, the Cowboy and the chopped cheese, I really had my mouth set for a burger so I ordered the chopped cheese and just added Mayo thinking I would be getting myself a nice hamburger. Anyway I get home and find out it's sort of like a sub sandwich and the meat is actually chopped up. I know it says chopped cheese but I had no idea would actually be chopped up in minced pieces. It tasted okay, not really cup of tea... so I gave it away and went to Wendy's instead . You guys should really make your cashier's are familiar with what's on the menu and to also listen to the customers and what they're asking for. That would really help out a lot for first -timers! I will be returning but I will be sure to bring my glasses so that I can read the menu clearly and make sure to get what I want, LOL. The fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I got extra fresh jalapeños on my grilled chicken sandwich! They have perfectly sautéed \"shoe string\" onions in some of their sandwiches, The food came out quick! The place was very clean (which seemed slightly out of character for that neck of the woods). Def recommend this joint"}
{"text":"I ordered the Rachel W/1000 island.
OMG!!!!
Without a doubt,one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten!!!
This place ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Found the location very easily, great marketing, fantastic cashier, ask for AZIZ custom butter garlic fries. We ordered: Spicy Chicken Sando with Avacado, empire steak without cheese,cilantro lime salad. No fountain drinks, No bathrooms, could use 3 more people helping out would help with getting the food out. A lot of people were served without the full order being brought out and looked annoyed. BUT the food is Amazing and the garlic fries I would recommend absolutely"}
{"text":"THANK YOU YELP for helping me find this place. Staff is super nice and food is delicious. I recommend any style of fries, anything with chicken, wings or a steak and cheese sandwich. I've read some negative reviews and the only thing I can say is that some foods won't travel well if ordered to go, regardless of where they are ordered from. Find this little updated gem, located in a older strip mall. You won't be sorry. :)"}
{"text":"I want to try every sandwich on the menu. 

This is one of my go to spots if I want something quick, tasty, and nearby.

The fat stack is is a solid 15/10 definitely would get again

Nestled inside the French roll is a hot link, beef brisket, cole slaw, French fries, and a sauce that I cannot seem to remember. What a great combination of flavors and textures. 

Don't come here if you're looking for a healthy and light meal! This is grade A coma inducing food and I love it! 

I want to try out their fries next time and the rest of the sandwiches. Definitely gonna keep this place in my arsenal of lunch spots! 

Clean interior, staff is friendly and the food is fresh. Don't understand why people are complaining about the location and it's surroundings? It doesn't affect the food quality and if you're really worried about the area, don't be. Just eat the food."}
{"text":"Newer place to open up. Clean decor and open kitchen concept. Staff super nice and attentive driving a pleasurable experience. Digital menu board and list of ingredients for each item made the order process smooth for our picky eaters (no onions). The food options were awesome as they range from hot/cold sandwiches and salads. So that made this a place to make multiple palates happy. The food, great, delicious and generous portions. A bit off the beaten path, but sometimes it's worth finding a gem."}
{"text":"I had there Philly cheese steak. Minus the peppers, the gentleman at the counter was very polite and friendly. Cheesesteake was very hot and tasted delicious, appropriate meat and vegetable amounts on a delicious bun. 1 star was taken away because I do believe the owner is the one who handed me my sandwich , packed to go in a bag with NO NAPKIN, don't bother to give me a bag if there's nothing in it besides one item. Thankfully I pack extra napkins in my vehicle because I am offen on the road when I take my lunch. 
Hopefully the owners read these reviews and learn from their mistakes. 
I will return to this location when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night with my boyfriend. We ordered the Bronx Club, Shrimp Po' Boy and Sonoran Dog. 
Both sandwiches were good, but the Sonoran Dog was not my favorite. The aesthetics of it when we opened the box were appealing, but the flavor just wasn't there. I love Sonoran Dogs usually and I don't think this particular dog does them justice. 
That dish aside, my Po' Boy surpassed my expectations with quality and flavor. This place is definitely an excellent find, will be returning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a New York native and since
I've never been to the East Coast I live vicariously through his foodie stories. Occasionally we find an authentic spot and I get a glimpse into what his normal food adventures used to be. When we found Outta Bronx and saw that it was rated nearly 5 stars we were really pumped to try it out. 

We ordered a hot chick sandwich, a small macaroni salad and the cowboy sandwich to go. We decided to keep our orders simple, because we were expecting some massive NY style sandwiches and didn't want to overdo it. What we received was mediocre at best. The hot chick was alright, but the chicken had a fishy taste. I'm assuming that is due to using the same frying oil for their shrimp. The cowboy tasted more like a Philly cheesesteak with BBQ sauce and some bacon. I didn't end up getting the macaroni salad, but rather they gave me a potato salad which was good... nothing too spectacular and not what I ordered. All in all, we didn't get the authentic NY style sandwiches we were anticipating. 

Maybe we went in with our expectations set too high, but either way we were left with something to be desired. In short the sandwiches were alright, but nothing to write home about. Honestly, the sandwiches were something I could see Subway, Quiznos or Togos putting out. The prices were a little high for what we received and I don't foresee us going out of our way again to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"What can I say there's lots of flavor in New York food. One of the things I enjoy the most was the ambience I felt a lot like home. I love what they did with the place and really stands out in the plaza. I noticed the establishment was pretty clean. It was like being in a shiny silver time machine going back to New York. This food was worth it for my cheat day. I had the string fries covered barbecue brisket grilled onions and American cheese. And boy does your eyes dance. 
Thank you for being so accommodating and I appreciate your hospitality I would definitely come back again for another enjoyable cheat day."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after reading reviews on Yelp.  The place was new and clean.   We had wings which were crispy outside and and well seasoned.  Several different sandwiches for the table.  Chopped Cheese was a hit.  The Cowboy was also good.  The owner was friendly.

More targeted towards take out, but probably 18 seats.

I will definitely be back to try some street fries.  Sandwiches filled us up on this trip."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza fries for pick up. Got there about 15 mins after i order, the guy told me to excuse the way the box looks and that food was fresh. I didnt think anything about it since i was running a lil late for work. When i opened the box i notice some of it had holes on it from what it looked like melting. Definetly looked and tasted like my food was REHEATED and not fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great quality and friendly service. The bread was sooo delicious! Must try the chopped cheese and garlic fries! Good thing I don't live close by because I'd be there everyday! Will be back whenever I get the next opportunity."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Ordered lunch for the office, so bought a bit of everything. everyone was raving! Great sandwich shop.

And a shout out to George who handled the order. He was awesome on the phone, he had the entire order correct and helped carry it out to the car. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Solid steak sandwich and awesome onion rings!! Really nice looking place as well! I think I'll be back to try some of the fries!"}
{"text":"Waited a little longer, but the sandwich was bomb! Have to give it 5 starts! I've been told to try the fries, next time I go I'll update the review on fries as well!"}
{"text":"Instead of going to one of our usual spots for lunch today, we decided to try something new. I came across this place in one of the Yelp emails about hot & new places. I checked out some pictures and decided I needed to try this place. 

I was a little weary of trying this place for one reason: my boyfriend. He's from Philly and always criticizes all of the sandwiches/hoagies here in Arizona. I was definitely worried he would be upset that we drove almost 30 minutes for a sandwich. 

We drove past it on the way there. It's located in a small strip mall next to a Water N' Ice store. There aren't many parking spots so once people realize how much of a gem of a place this is, that may be an issue. Apparently, they opened only 2 and a half weeks ago. I can tell you right now that we wish there was a location closer to us. (If you decide to open up another one, maybe Old Town Scottsdale or North Scottsdale please!) 

I ordered the Chopped Cheese and Brian got the Empire Steak (I may have the name wrong for his). We also got fried pickles and French fries. We didn't care for the fries... there was nothing special about them - if they would like some feedback, we would recommend a thicker cut French fry. Maybe it was our fault for ordering a plain order of fries instead of one of the crafty ones on the menu. 

The sandwiches were cut in half so we were able to share and try each other's. Mine was the winner! Brian and I both enjoyed it very much and would definitely get the Chopped Cheese again. He enjoyed his Empire sandwich but liked mine more. The bread that is used seems fresh and perfect. Ahhh, I'm dreaming about it already. Good bread for sandwiches is hard to come by on the West Coast. 

The fried pickles - get them and get a side of ranch. They are perfectly crisp and flavored. I am picky when it comes to fried pickles and only like pickle slices not wedges. Definitely would order these pickles again!

Looking forward to coming here again - even if it means a 30 minute drive (without traffic). Hopefully we will see another location nearby in the future. Best of luck and can't wait to try some other sandwiches soon!"}
{"text":"Baja Fries are my favorite, the service here is like no other. Called to place a pretty complicated order and the gentleman on the phone was patient and nice. My coworkers and I love this place and we are so happy they are just down the street! My coworker tried the Sonoran Hot Dog and it looked like a million bucks!"}
{"text":"Really liked it here. The people were really friendly. Always checking and making sure you're doing well. The food was good as well. 

Defiantly going back."}
{"text":"Aziz is wicked friendly and it's sincere. I'm not a big fan of sandwiches full of corned beef or pastrami, so I was glad to see my companions scarf down a Reuben and a Rachel so I could get the feedback. They were apparently fabulous, the Boar's Head meats really shining. The rye bread looked good and I did have a bite of sauerkraut, which had knockout flavor and texture. We shared a side of garlic butter fries and all three of us together couldn't finish it.

My meal was cheese steak fries and they were as savory and intense as the best chili cheese fries when you're really in the mood for something like that. I couldn't quite finish that, either, which is rare for me.

We were musing about different ways to order the sandwiches next time (e.g., swap the Reuben sauerkraut for some Rachel slaw) and Aziz overheard us and offered to make it over, even though it had been perfectly prepared. We declined and kept eating like sled dogs.

The inside decor is almost nonexistent, so it feels like a utilitarian kind of place, but most of the diners stayed rather than getting carryout, and the atmosphere was chill and cozy.

The air conditioning leaves something to be desired. But I did find that once I was sitting down eating, I didn't really think about it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Had the east coast pastrami....yummy!!!!!!!
It's nice to have a good sandwich place in the neighborhood that isn't a chain!
Everyone here is super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for the weekend, debating on where to go, we chose OUTTA BRONX for their great overall reviews. 
Had the Baja chicken, empire steak, corned beef on Reuben, and chicken wings. 
Everything was AMAZING. Lots of flavor and plenty of food. You definitely get your money's worth. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Mannnnnnnnn. Outta Bronx ain't NEVER did me wrong. I swear to god that food is so damn good. These good people are saving us moneyyy by not having to fly all the way to NYC to get a bomb chopped cheese from the bodega. Shout out to y'all. I've literally never had a bad meal from them and I get something different each time. Dead a**. I just ordered a cowboy sandwich, a hot chicken sandwich, and a shrimp po' boy all for my damn self smh. As soon as this grubhub dude gets here I'm tearing this uppp. OUTTA BRONX = A1 (that means really good)"}
{"text":"So GOOD. Went in not knowing what to get Dean recommended the Long Island! YAS!! Don't forget the chili cheese pastrami fries. They cook it right when you order. Everything this was fresh and hot. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat this place and their fry menu. I like the Baja Fries. Def a little slice of NY! Great owner, clean place, priced fair."}
{"text":"Split an Empire Steak sandwich with small fry with my wife! Awesome food. Good service. A little more expensive than I expected but good value."}
{"text":"We tried the Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings (delish), the Buffalo Wings and the fish and chips. All were great. Employees were nice. They were doing a good take out business."}
{"text":"This New York transplant is always on the lookout for NY style eateries so I came here as soon as I found out about it (through yelp, of course). It was a week before grand opening so finishing touches were still being added to the place but they had already been open for business for a few days. On that first visit I ordered the shrimp basket - six big, plump nicely battered and well seasoned shrimp on a bed of fries; it was a delicious, filling lunch. On the second visit I got the chopped cheese, the most modestly priced of their hot sandwiches and an iconic New York comestible (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/nyregion/chopped-cheese-sandwich-harlem.html?_r=0). It features ground Angus beef with melted American and provolone cheeses with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles; great combination of ingredients, so scrumptious I finished the whole thing even though I had intended to bring half of it home for later snacking. The onion rings I ordered on the side were so good I skipped the ketchup I normally have with onion rings.The place is simple and cozy, the crew is very friendly, and prices are very good."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about this place that's the sandwiches were hands down the bomb and the Baja fries were something out of this world and the wings were amazing and so crispy ordered lemon pepper and an order of hot with jalapeño slices these wings are hands down top 5 in the valley and just maybe the number one contender and in route to take the best for the best wings in the valley only down fall place is kinda small parking lot kinda small but the food speaks for its self I'll be returning to this place thank I'll for the great hospitality and the amazing food"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. I've driven past a lot and decided to stop. Not too busy when I got there. Service was great. Nice clean place. I ordered the Empire sandwich, good amount of filling great flavor bread roll was fantastic. I also ordered half dozen wings butter garlic style. Meh!  Sadly the skin was okay as far as seasoning but the meat had absolutely no flavor. Maybe the pre boil them. Next time I'll try a different flavor."}
{"text":"I had the Empire steak sandwich which was absolutely delicious. This is my 2nd time back with more visits to come. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp! The food is delicious and they have a great menu selection. I had the empire sandwich and it was so Good. Lots of meat and cheese and peppers and onions."}
{"text":"Cant even rate the food.  Wanted to give it a shot and drove all the way across town to try it and by the time we got there everyone has to use the restroom.  So I ask where it is and the kid behind the counter tells me they don't have a restroom.  So I ask him where he goes & he looks around and was like \"uh you could use the liquor store next door\".  Rude.  Yeah no thanks.  Ill pass.  We left without ordering."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates ordered shrimp with fries when it came it was a big plate of flavorless fries with 5 burnt shrimp what a waste for 13 dollars come on now"}
{"text":"Outta Bronx just opened two weeks ago and it's already one of my favourite places in the valley! It's almost an hour round-trip for me from home, but when you have a craving... it's worth the drive (luckily they are much closer to my office). Bringing their unique sandwich recipes straight from New York, this place is the epitome of local greazy-spoon take out. This isn't some generic \"not-from-Philly Philly cheesesteak\" place, this is a unique and very NY take on classic street-style sandwiches and heroes/subs.

Customer service: top notch, which is obvious since they just opened and make an effort to connect with the neighbourhood and their customers. Definitely has a family-vibe to the staff, giving the impression that a family just moved their entire local Bronx restaurant to Phoenix, as is. They have also been doing a great job on social media trying to connect - I already know that one of the main guys (owner probably) is Aziz and he loves to interact with the customers. Aziz may have no clue who I am, but when a place just opens and you already know some of the names - that shows how they are putting themselves out there for the guests. 

Location: located in a strip-mall at 40th & McDowell, with bright red paint outside - not the best neighbourhood so just be aware of your surroundings when parking and walking around outside. There are about 6-7 tables for dining-in, so if it's gets busy (and it does during peak hours) it can be hard to find a place to sit; be prepared to make it a take-out order. The interior is nice and very clean, with minimal decor. As of March 1st, they still haven't had a soda fountain installed - it's that new! 

Food: the most important part by far...  The menu is pretty simply, but has lots of options:  signature hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, wings, and a whole section dedicated to french fries - but not sides, these are entree servings. They have a bunch of different french fry recipes that involve meats and toppings and tons of gooey melted cheese. It's a big order, I could not finish one on my own and that says a lot. The sandwiches are mostly made on french baguette hero rolls, and they are really excellent. The meats and toppings are fresh & ample, and overflow from the heavy-duty size they serve. 

I have been twice now and each time got their famous signature Bronx item: the chopped cheese. I'm hooked! I never knew these existed, but apparently its a really popular item in the Bronx and Harlem - like NY's version of the Chicago hot dog or the Philly cheesesteak. And it lives up to its reputation - it's amazing. You'll just have to try it for yourself. But be prepared: be hungry and don't be on a diet lol. 
So the first time I went, I had the chopped cheese and didn't have to think twice about going back. The 2nd time was last night and I got the same thing again, and also got a Hot Beef for my wife. It's described as \"thin sliced\" but I guess thin is a relative term - the beef was pretty thick, and it was tasty (of course I had to have a bite to try it), my wife really liked it. We also wanted a side, and I decided to ask for just cheese fries. Served in an entree dish, they baked a mix of cheeses over the crispy fries - it wasn't just a cheese sauce poured over it, it was actual baked melted cheese. Very yummy and satisfying! These people know how to make the food that perfectly comforts me. 

I will definitely be frequenting this place as much as my budget and diet allows; I kind of want to try every item on their menu - they all sound so good! But it's going to be hard to not want a chopped cheese every time....
I think I have found my new favourite sandwich joint. Outta Bronx is badass and totally unique to Arizona. I wish they had a location in North Scottsdale - they would kill it there.

I look forward to Outta Bronx being a new tradition in the valley. They have the perfect combination of comfort NY food and great family hospitality. Totally feels like a local Bronx joint and looks like they could be a staple for Phoenicians. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the owner is always willing to make sure you are happy with your food.  He even allowed me to order something off the menu that reminded me of the Midwest.  Good old romanburger!! Been there several times for their subs and this place rocks!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent; they have something for everyone. I've now tried the chicken wings, Cobb salad, and the Cali Chick Sandwich, all of them, were delicious.

I've never been to the Bronx, but if the food tastes anything like 'Outta Bronx' I might just have to visit. 

Also, everyone is super friendly, and they've always accommodated my friend's food restrictions."}
{"text":"Great crispy wings; amazing hot beef sandwich and the friendliest staff !!!

sandwiches were great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is always good. And the service is amazing. Every time I go here the people that work there are always nice and very accommodating. Will continue to go back."}
{"text":"It's so hot and good!  The bread they came on was good, the fries were good, and the pricing's pretty good too!

We got the Empire Steak which is basically like a Philly cheese steak sandwich and the chopped cheese sandwich, which is like a loose meat cheeseburger on a baguette.  

I'd recommend both of these highly!"}
{"text":"Food and staff is on point. Got a half chop and half cheese steak with garlic butter fries..... amazing. Would have gotten 5 stars but it's as hot as a bums taint inside. Sweating while eating a cheesesteak wasn't on my bucket list but I'll check it off anyway."}
{"text":"This place just opened a few weeks ago and be warned, they are still getting things 'together' if you know what I mean. Because of the other reviews, I ran over there.

The positives are that there seem to be some nice people running the place, but there are some downsides they need to work on.

1) The menu board goes blank every five minutes. 2) I ordered a sandwich that had bacon on it. After waiting almost 15 minutes (and it wasn't busy in there), they tell me that they are out of bacon. I was willing to just go with my huge, expensive order of pizza fries, but instead of refunding me they insist on giving me a different sandwich. I say ok, but I really would have rather had just the fries.  In the end, the sandwiches are huge but I don't really like the bread.  I paid about $15 and ended up eating less than half of everything and threw the rest away as it is not something you can eat as leftovers.  3) I was not a fan of the area. Right near a liquor store in a questionable part of town. I was very uncomfortable coming/going as they were some people just hanging out in front of the liquor store looking like trouble.

I personally won't go back, but I think once they are in business longer they might be a good place for those 'in the area'"}
{"text":"Yehya was friendly upon entrance!! I had the pastrami fries and they were exceptional and way more than I expected!! I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, awesome food coming from a fellow New Yorker, and quick and easy. I had the Baja Chick and my boyfriend had the Hot Chick-delish!"}
{"text":"The Asian wings are just fricken delicious. Service was wonderful. We ended up ordering wings, 2 sandwiches, and fries and everything was wonderful. Good music playlist too while we were waiting. I gotta get more info about this secret menu cuz this place is legit. If you're still going to Quiznos, eggees, subway, or any other mediocre sandwich spot you should be ashamed. This place is 1000x better. Inexpensive too. The wings price is basically happy hour price at any bar."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, wonderful service! Worth the drive from Mesa! This was my first time after hearing all good things from a friend! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome array of reasonably priced sandwiches. Staff super friendly and it seems like you can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Two of my coworkers and I had lunch at Outta Bronx today. We've wanted to try it for ages after seeing pictures of their food on social media, and boy, did it live up to our expectations. The prices were reasonable, the portions were huge, the food was delicious, and the staff was friendly. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried the Baja Chick. It wasn't on the yelp menu but it's basically a chicken cheese steak with avocado and a Baja mayo.  Really good sandwich and I loved the bread.  Good onion rings too! The portions were good sized, I saved half for later.  I'll include a shot of my left overs since I forgot to get a before pic.    I'm definately going back because there was a bunch more stuff that I wanted to try and it's close to work."}
{"text":"Simply Fantastic! Went here on my lunch break & ordered the pastrami fries. The service was excellent & food was ready in about 10 minutes. The portion was the perfect size for an individual meal or to share. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Study the menu before you decide, because otherwise you'll be up at the counter for ten minutes trying to choose! So many good options, and for my first time i went with the BBQ Beef (as recommended by the cashier), and it was delicious. A bit fatty for my liking, but the flavor was outstanding! Just had a basic side of fries with it, which were nice and soggy how I like them. Decently priced, and I'm definitely coming back to try one of their other creations."}
{"text":"Just what this town needed! Another sandwich shop!!!

Well when you are the best of a mighty big field all I have to say is welcome!!!

The menu was designed using a deft hand with the condiments , yet the flavors soared. Crispy fries seasoned to perfection set the tone for a great list of crafted sandwiches.

My Pastrami sandwich was supurb, Im a pastrami guy and I have only tasted 1 better, and that was Little Miss, Better here because there isn't a hour wait. Attention to details start with the great pickles, and paper lined platters.

The dining room is tidy and organized, subway tiles, brick walls and high definition menu boards are a sign the owner is taking care of business.

Skip the rest and try the best, its worth the extra buck."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and had it bookmarked for a year but never found the opportunity to try it, until today.

This place is bomb! Parking is limited just as a heads up and it's in a very assuming part of town. Walking in there's about 10-12 seats total but the place is super clean with nice decor. 

I ordered the Empire Steak and my friend ordered the Long Island, we also had the pizza fries. The Empire Steak is essentially a philly, it's very very good. The best part is the baguette, that's amazing baguette. My friend enjoyed his sandwich as well. The pizza fries are crazy good, they taste like cheesy garlic bread + plus pizza.

I can't wait to try other other things on the menu, this is a very good spot."}
{"text":"It was Yumm! The cashier/cook lady was great !! Great service !!! Definitely coming back and tying another one of their sandwiches!! Pizza Fries hit the spot"}
{"text":"This place is so close yet so far. Their sandwiches are on a heavier side so it might not be a bad idea to share them. There aren't many restaurants in South Arcadia. If you're craving a greasy sandwich, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Here's a first! My foodie colleague and I found a place that neither of us had heard of or tried before. Outta Bronx has been tucked away on the south side of McDowell Road at 41st Street for the last four months or so. And we found it after a Google search and the strength of its Yelp! reviews.

I'm glad we found Outta Bronx because it's very close to work, the place is super clean, the guys who own and run this sandwich shop are really friendly, and the food is really generous and delicious! 'Nuff said.

But I'll digress. Our cashier recommended their most popular sandwich, the Empire State Sandwich, their take on a Philly cheesesteak. It's huge. It's really good. And it's worth every penny. But this isn't just a sandwich shop. There are specialty hot dogs, salads, several variety of topped and loaded fries, and more.

There are so many options on the menu, it's gonna be hard to resist coming back to try more. And with the happy faces behind the counter and manning the grill, it will be damn near impossible. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Empire steak was a good cheese steak. Cheese was nicely melted, veggies were good, only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is beef was a little tougher than I like but I'll be back."}
{"text":"What. The. What. Did I just eat.

We pull up and my coworkers are looking at me like where the F are we?!? Inside the place was packed with a line out the door but the beats were bumpin' so we didn't mind. We got the Reuben, Hot Chick, and Pizza Fries and everything was amazing! I CANNOT wait to try some of the other fry combinations. Also, the staff is adorable and friendly. 

Tip: For the specialty fries order them crispy..."}
{"text":"Man this place has unbelievable sandwiches that's replicate the East coast very well. They only.use the freshest ingredients (it even says so in their mission statement). I recommend the Empire State or the Fatstack. I came here for a music festival in Phoenix and I ended up coming here 3 times. Wasn't let down once. The food is a big portion too. Half the time I had to take the other half of the sandwich back to our Air BnB. Their fries were good to and their variety of cold subs, salads, hot subs, and fries makes this place a great place for lunch. Hope they stay in buisness so I can come back in the future."}
{"text":"I had my friend pick up some grub here...
We ordered Pops Chili Cheese Dog, Cali Dog, Fried Pickles, and Onion Rings. The hotdogs were extremely salty and I would recommend them if you're looking for something to eat after a night binge drinking on Mill or have played too many games of beer pong. Do not order from here if you're sober or watching your cholesterol. 
The onion rings were super good! A little to crunchy but hey, after a eating less than a quarter of my Chili Cheese Dog, I needed something else to appease my appetite. 
I didn't try my friends fried pickles but she said they weren't very good."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and husband after arriving into Phoenix for the first time! We're starving and stopped here before heading to the hotel. The employees were extremely helpful and knowledgeable on the popular dishes . I recently got diagnosed with a wheat allergy and they were able to make my sandwich into a salad , I ordered the Bronx and the turkey bacon and avocado was delicious! My husband ordered the shroomy Swiss, mother ordered the empire steak and my dad ordered the hot beef. They said there sandwiches were outa this world and a perfect place to stop after a long day of traveling!! Thank you for such a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Straight up NYC.   Got the Fatstack.  Holy **** great sandwich.  Also the pastrami chili cheese fries.  Thank God my nephew showed up just a pile of awesome deli decadence.  Really great service.  Damn on to my food coma.  This place is perfect for football season."}
{"text":"I would give this place another try, but the sandwich I chose tonight wasn't my favorite. I ordered the Shroomy Swiss sandwich. The meat was a great quality & all ingredients seemed fresh, but it just didn't have much seasoning/flavor. The bread was super delicious though. My husband had the Big Tex fries and he liked it, just said it was more sauce than he likes and would order it on the side next time"}
{"text":"A taste of the Bronx in Phoenix Arizona

My friends always tease me when we are searching for a good sandwich shop.  I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little  \"Joey\"  like from the show  \"Friends\" when it comes to my sandwiches. 

Today, we went to \"Outta Bronx\" for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the crew at \"Outta Bronx\" are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; \"Outta Bronx\" is here to stay.

It was hard to decide what entrees to choose after viewing the menu, everything smelled and looked delicious. After a few minutes our decision was made, we went with the \"Sonoran Dog\" and the \"Hot Shroomy Swiss Sandwich \" and both were delicious. 

The Shroomy Swiss Sandwich at \"Outta Bronx\" is  the perfect brisket sandwich, loaded with thin slices of cooked-to-order brisket, sauteed garlic herb mushrooms, melted swiss cheese, fresh tomatoes and lettuce all on a lightly toasted French Baguette Roll. This sandwich might be big enough for two, but I decided to eat the whole sandwich after my very first bite. I was so full after eating my sandwich I didn't have any room to try my friends Sonoran dog. However, my  lunch companion said her \"Sonoran Dog\" was the best she's ever had.

The staff at \"Outta Bronx\" are very accomdating, friendly, and personable.  I will definitely be back in the near future for the food and music that brings me back to growing up in the Bronx."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here it's a must! Amazing food and service. The owner is very approachable and they bake their own bread! My friend who is from Queens loved it! He said it was like having a little bit of NY here locally. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great sandwiches and great staff. Food is delicious and fresh always. An unreal menu with many lunch choices. I continue to work through the menu and try something different every time and never disappointed.
Salads are great! Cilantro-Lime is a go to! My favorite sandwiches are the Chopped Cheese and when you are really hungry look toward the Fatstack. Great people who work here and atmosphere! Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches for a good price. Got the shrimp po boy which had humungous shrimp on it well cooked and not greasy and my friend got the hot chick which looked really good. The ingredients seem fresh here and I would go back for a sandwich craving."}
{"text":"I had the steak sandwich and it was really good. You wouldn't think the restaurant is much from the size and from outside but it's always those kind of places that rock! I look forward to trying other things."}
{"text":"Heading to a show on the east side of Phoenix and looked for a place to grab a sandwich. A quick search on Yelp led us to Outta Bronx.

Hubby ordered the Empire Steak, which he proclaimed as \"really good\" and onion rings. I enjoyed the Cal Chic but opted for fried instead grilled. So much food! But really good food! Next time we will share one sandwich.

The ingredients were fresh and not prepackaged, prebreaded, etc. The bun was fresh and just the right texture. The onion rings had a good taste. And the staff was very friendly.

Our tab for two sandwiches, onion rings and two canned drinks came to $25.50, plus a few dollars in the tip jar."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots to eat when I'm in this part of the city.  Def worth checking out.  So many options for fries...my favorite is the garlic butter fries.  I've tried a few of the sandwiches which have all been great."}
{"text":"Pretty g
Good u had a cilantro salad was great my co-worker was also really happy with his meal only draw back we went on a really hot and humid day and as small as his place was the a.c. couldn't jeep up with the ovens.. guy behind the counter was really cool tho and made apologies rite away about the heat .."}
{"text":"Their food is so bomb. Great costumer service. I saw on an old menu and the prices have raised by at least two dollars on some of the items which bums me out but hey whatcha gunna do? Let us know if you have coupons at least! I recommend the philly cheese fries"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are not only delicious but huge. Owner super friendly. Place is small, but has plenty of tables. The shrimp po boy was exceptional."}
{"text":"My boyfriend picked this up for lunch one day and I am so excited to go back and try more!!!

From what I tried, the food is freshly made with high quality ingredients. We got a bacon, turkey, avocado sub and it was delicious! The bread they serve it on is nice and crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside.

My favorite though was BBQ Brisket French fries. They were French fries with BBQ brisket, melted cheese, and perfectly sweet onions.

Can't wait to go in and order more!"}
{"text":"We were staying by the airport for a few days of warm weather in Dec and tried this place on a whim; soooo glad we did. After much deliberation, I got the Hot Chick and hubby had the Pizza Burger; both were HUGE and delicious. The chicken was tender and crispy not terribly spicy but good heat. Burger was tender and flavorful. Both were served on a perfectly soft, crusty French baguette with fresh produce. We also got the fries which were sprinkled generously with paprika (and maybe a tad too much salt) but hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall, VERY good and we'll def be back to try some of the other fab choices."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  The bread was perfect. Soft fluffy perfect amount of meat veggies and cheese.  
The Empire was awesome. 

Will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. More than enough food and options to continually choose from. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is 

Service was good. It's a small spot but they are serving up some good shit!"}
{"text":"Great taste and representation of da Bronx right here in Phoenix!  Any choice is awesome.  I had the Bronx club and it was delicious.  I also sampled the pastrami and it was very yummy!  I had it just as its own entity and it was properly served with mustard!  

Great little store to eat at."}
{"text":"When I found this place it was like finding a pot of gold! This place here is badass! There is nothing in all of AZ like this place! Its a place where you know you can get some tasty real food! Not like all those boring chain restaurants in AZ

I had the:
Lemon pepper  wings- Ohhh lord they were soo good. Crispy Crispy Crispy

Onion Rings- Batter was so tasty and big portion!

Shrimp basket- Pic attached (Ahhhh-maaaa-zing)

Empire State- man oh man

Everything is sooo good we can't wait to go down the entire menu! 

Thank you sooo much outta Bronx for bringing some life to AZ"}
{"text":"I was a little worried about the location when we arrived at the strip mall in a run down part of town, but the food outweighed the concern. The sandwiches are generously loaded, and while the pizza fries weren't amazing there were other options to try in the future. Also, great people watching."}
{"text":"On my surprise trip to Arizona, we decided to stop by and try the food after seeing it on yelp. Now I was super sad not to see the kool aid bar, that's why we had initially even came. We took a brief look at the menus before choosing a bbq beef sandwich & the Baja chick sandwich. Heads up there is NO restroom, after the long drive from Cali I was quite frustrated with this also. After the long trip and finally checking in we dig in. The Baja chick is gross, the sauce is too much and overkill's the food. You are paying for bell peppers and sauce. There was barley any chicken on the sandwich, it was a sauce and bell pepper onion mix on a hard French baguette. Never again! I had a bite of his bbq beef sandwich and it was really good, that one I would definitely recommend to try. A waste of money but hey it's the life of a foodie."}
{"text":"Went there tonight to try something new in the area. Food and service both spectacular and the cole slaw is amazing. 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff! Had to grab a quick lunch and discovered this gem! Empire steak for me and my dad grabbed a NY dog. Both were delicious and freshly made."}
{"text":"Tried Outta Bronx when they first opened, at the time I lived in the apartments around the corner. I was craving a shrimp po' boy and when I yelped it this restaurant came up. It was delicious!!!!! I actually went back the next day! Everything about the sandwich was tasty. And they put a nice amount of shrimp on there. I also found it faster to call in your order ahead of time"}
{"text":"Great Customer service... my order took a lil longer then normal, do they have me an order of seasoned fries while I waited.

And the wings are bomb,  definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem ... now don't let the location fool you into driving by. This place is beyond Amazing! 

Let's start with the interior. Eventhough this is a small space, it is a Modern total remodel that is clean and well done. Definitely gives you that New York Bronx feel. 5stars

Customer Service - 5 stars
Was greeted immediately and given recommendations.  The owner was very friendly and went the extra mile. 

Food - off the charts
We ordered 2 of the hot sandwiches as well as the Baja fries. Tons of melted goodness. They were outstanding. Worth every penny!! Large portions too! I'm actually glad we are not any closer.. my waistline would definitely suffer from multiple visits weekly ...lol

Glad we found another place to add to our must haves. It is worth the drive and $$. I would recommend this one to everyone"}
{"text":"The reviews speak for themselves. They got great food at this joint. Each time I go in I order something different and always leave happy with what I had. The employees at Outta Bronx were friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place! WOW! Delicious sandwiches. French fry plates that stand alone as a meal. Fried pickles that were lightly breaded, huge portions. I also asked for extra cheese on my chopped cheese and guess what? They gave me extra cheese!!!!! Yes!! they have gained my love for that act alone!! Mohammad (uncle is Aziz the owner) is absolutely awesome, sweet, funny. We had a great conversation about travel. I cannot wait to go back and try other items. Please check this place out. Support local. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Go see Aziz and his crew for some good, home cooked food. Very pleasant staff, eager to please!

The beautiful golden fried shrimps are friggin delicious. Pastrami is Boars Head, sandwich was great. 

Nice setup, interesting menu, fresh ingredients.  Salads are coming soon, Aziz said. Go here and he'll make sure you're happy."}
{"text":"I ordered their cold sandwich with salami and all those other yummy meats (Southside i think it was called) which their employee recommended to me and I must say I loved it! At first I was a bit turned off at the price of $9 for a sandwich, but then I ate it and couldn't finish it all in one sitting so I saved the rest for a pre gym snack and after getting essentially two meals out of it I was happier with my purchase. The taste was delicious, it was super refreshing, the toppings went all the way to the end of the bread (Most sub places think we want a bite with just bread at the end of our sandwiches, or they are lazy)! In all, I live right by here and I am happy I do because I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Nice little gem in the ghetto between a liquor store and a water and ice. You can get drunk, eat some good ass food then hit the water and ice for some dessert. A buddy of mine took me here as he goes frequently and I gotta say, food was really good. I had the Empire Steak, sliced beef was flavorful, veg was cooked really well and the bread....the bread set it off. It was soft and salted with a slight crunch. The onion rings we're beer battered and fried well. When you take a bite, the onion doesn't slide out of the ring(I hate that with a passion). Overall had a good time and good food. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Food amazing! Service was better! If your ever in the Phoenix area check this gem out! Huge portions and quality ingredients! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at the Outta Bronx. Great sandwich . Had the empire , the baguette was fresh. Service was great thanks Aziz. Definetly be back ."}
{"text":"Was not expecting much but food was great and owner who rang me up was very friendly. I m bummed they are not open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Came in around six in the afternoon the place was fairly lonely though there was about two other people there sitting down and eating I ordered the empire sandwich along with the pizza fries I had a very high expectations for the pizza fries but they were tasteless and tasted like cafeteria fries nothing was happening with the cheese the cheese was pretty hard. I was imagining that it would be melted and gooey and just nice and warm but it was pretty cold the cheese was pretty hard so it was not gooey to dip your fries in but the fries were lacking taste.  I also kind of found it  disappointing that they don't have fountain drinks it's more like a canned soda that kind of sucks because I would rather keep refilling if it's heavy food like subs and fries"}
{"text":"Amazing Philly cheese steak.  

Garlic fries were soggy though...

Will come back for the cheese steak."}
{"text":"First time eating here yesterday! This place was so fast and delicious! Will be here a lot more."}
{"text":"This is our new go to spot!

One night while looking for dinner we found this place on Yelp & were very pleased. Since we've found this place we've been back twice in one week ? but it's that good!!!

The sizes are great as they aren't too small to where you aren't full. Depending on the sand which you can have leftovers!

They also have wings (very yummy) & a great shrimp basket- the shrimp are fried to perfection.

We are definitely repeat customers."}
{"text":"The service inside the well thought out decor is fast and very friendly. And the cheesesteak...one of the best I have had in town! Melty cheese, tender steak, and just the right amount of peppers, shrooms and onions. Did I mention one of the most crucial components of a good cheesesteak...the roll!!!  The roll has the perfect texture and holds the ingredients together really well without getting soggy. Well done O.B."}
{"text":"While heading in from the East side we decided to try this sandwich shop.  Friendly little place with extensive menu for sandwiches. Freshly made and brought out  to you if you eat in. Had the pastrami over fries with onions and cheese. Delicious to me and enough to share or take home. My friends had the brisket and pastrami sandwiches. The one who had the brisket kept saying how good the bread was. I said it better be its a sandwich shop. Uggggh
Average prices $9-$12.00"}
{"text":"I just had a sandwich here. We'll, I had half a sandwich....I couldn't eat the whole thing! Try the Long Island. If you don't like it, let me know...I'll eat yours. 
Fries were crispy, not greasy. People were friendly. Try this. You'll like it. I'm"}
{"text":"We go there almost everyday. The owner is awesome and the food is amazing! Our goal is to get everything from the menu cuz nothing has disappointed us yet!"}
{"text":"I cant remember the name of the sandwich I ordered but it had Turkey and beef and cheesy goodness in the absolutely perfect baguette. I ordered via postmates and had delivered to my hotel. OMG, even after delivery there was a perfect crunch as you bite in and the fillings were delicious and hot. I hate sandwiches that are all bread and no filling, and this met all my requirements for the perfect indulgence. I will order again!!"}
{"text":"After being contacted by the owner and an over the top offering for resolution, I'm back to bump my review from 3 to 5 stars. Attention to the small details is what will keep an entrepreneur successful. I wish them he best of success moving forward and am exciting to eat this place again and again!"}
{"text":"We ordered \"The Fatstack\" & Pastrami Fries they were delicious  loved the sandwich !!
owner was very friendly will definitely be coming back !!"}
{"text":"This place is really good 
I have been looking for a good pastrami sandwich and this place nailed it 
If u get a chance I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I got the butter garlic parmesan wings. They were meaty and delicious, and perfectly crispy. But the flavoring was not so good, with all the grease of butter without any of the fragrance. The garlic and parmesan was also clumpy and barely adhering to the wings. I ended up getting bottled BBQ sauce from my fridge and adding them to the wings. My s/o loved his BBQ wings. 

The Baja fries were a little soggy by the time we got them home (20 min drive, maybe) but they had a good kick, with a great toppings-to-fries ratio. 

Parking was easy, because it was in a strip mall. Would go again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Other things need work. Menu price probably wouldn't bring me back, and shouldn't be advertised as cheap on here. And access to a bathroom was tough. As for good eats on that side of town I would suggest it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and ordered the Green Goddess.  The amount of food you get for the price is awesome.  The restaurant is very clean and nice looking.  The only thing I would change about the Green Goddess, is I feel like it missing a vinaigrette touch.  Other than that, everything about this place was awesome!  Fast and very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich. Bread is soft but doesn't get mushy. Great meat. We had the Fatstack and the Long Island. 
Try it you'll love it."}
{"text":"No ice-no air conditioning-$17 for a basic sandwich fries and a CAN of Diet Coke...again w no ice.  Ghetto location with lots of beggars around.  Drive a couple miles further towards Indian school rd...much better options"}

{"text":"So my family and I stayed at a hotel in Tempe and we are from out of town. When it came to deciding where to eat I used Yelp and just found something nearby and with good reviews. This place had excellent reviews and was 5 minutes away. The location isn't bad, it's not a full size restaurant which is great for on the go or lunch. And parking was easy. When we arrived the place was clean, the guys at the front were friendly and understood it was our first time there. So I asked what was good and recommendations and they told me the Empire Steak I believe it was called. They were both very knowledgable about the ingredients and customer inputs which made the decision easier. What I liked the most is everything was made fresh and on the spot. When the food was ready they brought it to our table and let me tell you, presentation is everything and the food was making our mouths water once on our table. In no way did anything look small, in fact we ordered a thing of fries thinking we would need it and ended up being stuffed by the end! By the time we all finished we were pleased and happy and the gentleman came and grabbed our plates to throw away for us. I will highly recommend this place and come again when in town! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to lunch at Outta Bronx. While the location was nothing special and there was limited parking which could pose a problem, once you are inside the restaurant the atmosphere and staff are friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I went with my mom and son. My mom and I split the Long Island and my son had Pizza fries. Food was good and we'll be back. Place has little seating and we came in right before the afternoon rush. Staff are really nice and friendly.  4 stars for it being a bit pricey for just a sandwich."}
{"text":"I deliver Outta Bronx food to customers all the time, and I just had to taste it for myself. Well I'm so glad I did! This is my new favorite spot on cheat day. With sandwiches like the Shroomy Swiss and Philly Cheese Fries seasoned to perfection and dripping with juicy goodness, it will be yours too! It definitely had me reminiscing about my college days on the East Coast. The warm greeting when you walk  in has you feeling welcomed and at home whether it's your first visit or 30th visit. I imagine they get lots of regular customers, and I'll be one of them!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Met the owner and he was very accommodating and polite. The food was amazing and hopefully I see this place on TV!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mediterranean Salad through Grubhub while at work. Delivery was on time with no issues.

When I opened the salad, I noticed multiple pieces of fabric/hair on the salad in various spots. Not small pieces, rather large and very very noticeable. At this point, the salad was deemed inedible. I could practically wear there salad to an ugly sweater party with the unwanted toppings of \"delectable\" fur.  

The other ingredients seemed to appear fresh; But I can't speak to the taste as the salad is currently taking permanent residence in the garbage bin.

A refund was issued from Grubhub. I'll keep my clothes shopping and lunch endeavors separate in the future while I order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just had this for dinner tonight was really excited to taste after I seen the ad on Facebook it lived up to the expectations very flavorful  and fresh awesome customer service  clean place.  But most of all food. Great can't wait to go back and try other things !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. The Nogales street dog was unbelievable, and I'm picky.  No ambiance, great great small place with awesome personality.  Get their food.  Incredible dog."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and found OUTTA BRONX on yelp. I had a craving for wings and fried pickles, so that's what I ordered. 

The Asian wings and fried pickles were delivered promptly. However, the two sides of ranch dressing were not delivered. It's kinda hard for me to eat pickles with no ranch dressing and wings without ranch (or blue cheese dressing). So I knocked off a star. I must say the cook on the wings was perfect (crispy), and they were freshly prepared (still hot when I got them). I would have liked the wings to have more sauce bc I could barely taste the Asian sauce on them. The pickles were also good, but really salty. I probably would have been able to escape some of the salt with the ranch dressing I ordered (hint, hint, that's why I asked for it). 

If I return to the area I may try a sandwich option and some fries. Please note, I will ask for ranch dressing just because I feel it is owed to me.Lol!"}
{"text":"Another great meal, I just love this place. The service is always awesome, you can tell the owner really cares about his product and his customer. I ordered the black and white turkey sandwich, which was delicious and the turkey was not over processed like so many other places. The bread was fresh and the portions were huge! My husband ordered the Big Tex fries (brisket) and he really enjoyed his as well. The restaurant was clean, prices are very reasonable, and we are always treated like special guests. I highly recommend Outta Bronx to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I must say just had the Empire State sandwich and oh man was it incredible!! Place is super clean and the staff and owner are extremely friendly! Will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Well my first time going to this place and let's just say it wasn't a very good impression. The food I ate was very good especially the cheesesteak sandwich. Really enjoyed it. The fries taste like the oil was a little old. But the worst part of this was the service. My co worker and I ordered at 11:02am and didn't get our order until 11:35. People who came in after us received their order before us. Mind you my co worker got only 6 wings. Seems like they only had one person cooking at a lunch time which is concerning. Then they try to give my food to someone else because they didn't know who it belonged to. We had to end up taking it to go as it took 30 minutes to receive a cheesesteak sandwich 3 wings and an order of fries. Really enjoyed the taste of the meal besides the fries but will be hard to go back since it takes entirely too long to get our food. Oh and my co worker enjoyed her 6 wings. FYI prices are a little steep."}
{"text":"I love this place it's super clean and they have the cutest lady working up front!! I had the empire (her recommendation)  and my boyfriend had the hot chick and both are SO GOOOOOD lol 
Great place 100% would recommend"}
{"text":"Best ever!! I had the pastrami fries they were the best!! The owner azis is very nice. I will definitely come back to this place !!"}
{"text":"Read great reviews on here and couldn't wait to try it out!! YUM. YUM. YUM. I had the Cali Chick. It was phenomenal.  Flavor was amazing. Also had the Empire Steak...WOW!! Great customer service as my daughter wasn't feeling well and wasn't hungry and the owner came out with a grilled cheese (on the house) for her and said,\" this ALWAYS makes me feel better!!\" She ate it and loved it! Can't wait to go back. This will definitely be my new #1 spot when I'm craving a sub or even a hot dog!! Thank you Outta Bronx for coming to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place, you would not expect such a great lunch spot in such a shoddy neighborhood.  I have been here now a half dozen times and tried several of their hot sandwiches and a couple of salads.  All have been very good.  Great quality, large portions (the salads are surprisingly large and filling).  One of my go-to lunch spots at work now."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Amazing fries. Hissy fit fries and fat stack is what I ordered."}
{"text":"Food's dope. Staff was super nice. Portions are generous. I ordered the Baja fries and the po'boy sandwich, both were delicious. The shrimp was much bigger than I expected and cooked well."}
{"text":"After hearing about a new little sandwich joint that had just opened up, I jumped into Outta Bronx yesterday after work. Wasn't thinking ahead when I subjected myself to weekday 4:30pm traffic to 40th and McDowell from Uptown/Central Phoenix but by the time I thought about it, I was already en route. So very glad I trudged on...

Walking in, there isn't much that jumps out at you but give it time. They're still green. I have a feeling that we are going to see many more of these pop up as word gets out. But I'll get to that in a minute. Either way, there were maybe 5 or 6 small tables inside so you can eat there if you like and the ambiance was good enough to allow for it. Think of a small gyro shop or take-out place. Kinda like that.

The service from the kid behind the counter was exemplary. You could tell he was proud of the product and a fan, too. He made some solid recommendations on his favorites and had a smile the whole time. I ordered the Chopped Cheese sandwich and my buddy got the Shrimp Po' Boy. We also split some of the Baja Fries. Price was very reasonable. Around $7.50 for my sandwich and a can of soda for a buck. 

While we were waiting for our food, I saw some of the other menu items being prepared and served. The Chili Fries looked awesome and their hot dogs are freakin' HUGE!

We got the food relatively quickly (as quick as you would expect anywhere else) and took it back to my place to chow it down. My sandwich was 100% exactly what I was looking for when I ordered it. Beefy, cheesy, gooey yumness and the bread was good quality, too.
I tried one of the shrimp from the Po' Boy and will DEFINITELY be ordering that very soon. There were 8 very large fried shrimp and the sauce was perfect.

The Baja Fries came in a large to-go container and the thing was filled with 'em. Fries with cheese, jalapeno's, chicken, peppers, onions, covered in a spicy aioli sauce... so good. But don't expect to knock down a sandwich and a large order of their street fries on your own.
NO, this isn't me challenging you, it's just a suggestion! Hell, I could do it if I wanted to... and if I didn't want to accomplish anything for the rest of my day... Hahaha

If you're ever in the area (or even if you're not) and you want a good, comfort-food style sandwich, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. 
There isn't another menu in town like it and the quality of the food will bring you back for more."}
{"text":"I had an awesome sandwich here! Also the staff was incredible. They were so friendly and wanted to add a personal touch to their service. We went here when my flight was delayed at the airport. It was a great stop. I recommend the spicy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been to so many places in Phoenix and nothing has topped this place. Great people great music and man great food. I've never had a bad experience here! Best service I've ever had. The family is awesome and welcoming. And the food! Delicious! So many selections of fries. If you thought carne Asada fries were good MAN are you missing out! The sandwiches literally make you feel like you're back home!"}
{"text":"Attended their grand opening yesterday and got a free Chopped Cheese sandwich.  It was full sized and DELICIOUS.  Chopped Angus beef, hot and tender, with a real beefy taste.  Melted cheese, all gooey and sticky.... wow.  Loved it, and the regular price is just $6.50.  Totally worth it!

I live nearby, so Outta Bronx is gonna get their investment in me back 1000%.   It smells like heaven inside, and I can't wait to try their other items!  

I will re-review after I make a few more trips.  We'll see if they can score 5 stars...."}
{"text":"Great Outta NY Deli. Great place recommend it's good friendly Brother from NY NY..............."}
{"text":"I gotta head back to this place like Michael Phelps in the second quarter of his I.M.

great, great, great wings. perfect crispiness to it, while still maintain the exquisite juiciness of a good piece of chicken. I split the flavors- buffalo and Asian Invasion. Buffalo brought the flavor; no nonsense, just greatness. Asian Invasion really wowed me tho. To be honest, i would have liked the flavor no matter bc of the name, but I got invaded and it was awesome. Most wing places swing and miss on Asian-y flavored wings (whether its Teriyaki, Korean BBQ, Sweet Chili, Sriracha, etc.) No missin here tho. Go get it."}
{"text":"Had the Baja fries and I was very impressed!!  Lots of flavor and ingredients. I'm a pretty big eater and it was plenty of food too.  Owner was attentive, friendly and professional and very positive.  Great experience, must try..."}
{"text":"So came here to try out after seeing it on FB and man they did not disappoint!!! It's a small place but it's welcoming and friendly! Cashier was polite and showed us the whole menu... we ordered the Empire State hot sandwich and we ate it so quick and it was so  good; didn't get any pictures of it... we also got the pizza fries and they were also great, pic included. I also ordered 2 different types of wings and they were crispy and moist inside, with lots of flavors we got Asian and garlic parm..... we only waited 6 minutes for it all.... only one complaint.... no ranch for my wings lol but it's okay it was all worth it..."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever for New York food. The empire steak sandwich is so delicious, including  cheese, meat, onion and etc. The service is what make this place my Favorite place for lunch. The owner aziz is an amazing person to know and meet. The menu is even outstanding mark in the restaurant to see, as keeping looking at it with so many various types of sandwiches, never gets your eyes distracted from it. Defiantly I'll come back ."}
{"text":"Had the Southside sandwich for lunch. Served up fast and friendly! Will be back, soon!"}
{"text":"Good lunch place with great staff. I had a grilled
chicken sandwich (cali chick) and was really happy. Very clean."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  Big inventive food.  Great friendly service. Just five minutes north of sky harbor north entrance. If you have the time stop here."}
{"text":"Service was out standing everyone was nice. Offered to move some tables around since they don't have a big table. Place was clean and very modern like. Food was okay. Pastrami fries with bacon: pastrami was really good and fresh. Fries was soggy. Wings (garlic parm and Asian ) wings was cooked well and juicy. Sauce was kind of bland. Onion rings: 5star perfect. Perfect crispyness and not too much batter. Not very greasy either. My favorite out of everything we ordered."}
{"text":"This place was great!!  The sandwiches are HUGE!! The owner Aziz was so kind and gracious. Not only was the food good but the service was also fast and friendly. We will be back the next time we are in town for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Friendly service. Everytime I've gone I've tried something new. The staff is always helpful with trying new things. I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Tried the corned beef sandwich. Tasty and lots of meat. My bf had the philly steak. Both delish. The area is a little neighborhood sketchy but that makes it even better.  Can't wait to try again!"}
{"text":"Great little place hidden on the South side of McDowell.  

I had the Fatstack.  Very original with fries in the sandwich, hot link, great sliced beef, and coleslaw.  

The bread is great. The owner worjs up front.  He is a super friendly nice guy. I will be back to try other sandwiches.

They open at 10am.  Beat the crowd. Parking is limited."}
{"text":"Had a long lay over in Phoenix and went to yelp for some help to find a good place to eat! Stumbled across \"outta Bronx\" and oh man !! I was beyond pleased! Ordered the cowboy and it was a really good size with great flavor and jalapeños! But what really made this restraunt was the service! The owner was super nice and helpful when asking for recommendations and will definitely come back if I happen to be in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was out of this world! Highly recommend! You must stop by and visit the friendly staff and taste this food"}
{"text":"This is like hitting the ball out of the ballpark!  It's like slam dunk!!
We ordered the empire sandwich, the corned beef on rye (possibly our favorite), the coyboy, the cali chicken, along with regular fries, garlic fries, and onion rings (these were great too!).  Everything was wonderful!  The bread was outstanding, meat and fixin's were hot and generous.  Axis, the guy behind the counter, was super-helpful and friendly and funny -\"yeah, you can use the bathroom but no tagging!\"
Most of us carried out about half a sandwich , so portions were generous as well.
Definitely come here!!!"}
{"text":"I was born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn.  This place was great!  Worth the drive from GIlbert.  Felt at home since I could tell that many other diners were also from the East Coast.  The food was very good.  I had the Empire Steak sandwich, wife had a fish sandwich and our daughter had a pizza burger.  We all shared fries and onion rings.   I love everything about this place except that they have limited seating.  They are going to do extremely well and I won't be surprised if they start franchising."}
{"text":"Live in the general area and I've been here twice since they opened this month. Don't let the location or the small parking lot keep you away. 

Spotless, small interior; welcoming and open staff! The guy who gave a 1-star for no bathroom, idkwtf he was thinking. It's a compact eatery, you'll see what I mean when you go in. I mean, they do take to-go orders.

First visit, I ordered the Fatstack and a side order of Philly Steak Fries. Phenomenal! Definite recommend, very tasty and large portions (The fries could be their own mean, I took them to work for lunch the next day.)

Second visit, I got the Long Island and a side of fried pickles. Amazing sandwich, and the seasoning used for the fried pickles has an awesome spicy kick. 

Great food, good prices, just go."}
{"text":"Recently the sandwich shop near my clinic closed in the Chinese Cultural Center. So my co-workers and I started the search for a new local place. We found this place on my iPhone food maps so we thought we would give it a try. The owner was behind the counter and greeted us when we went in. Aziz was very personable and had us laughing. He suggested some food and we took his recommendations. The sandwiches were good but the BBQ Texas fries were amazing!  We can't wait to go back and try some other items on his menu. It was close to our clinic and he said to call ahead and order so all we had to do was pick up. Which is very convenient when you are on a schedule. Thank you Aziz for the special attention that you give to your menu items. We will be back!  I would highly recommend this place if you want a good sandwich with real ingredients."}
{"text":"I had the Empire Steak sandwich and my friend had the fish and chips. Both awesome. Their coleslaw is by far the best I've had. Great friendly staff. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better. Don't be scared away by the location, the interior was very clean and the food came out hot and delicious. The fried pickles were amazing. Our sandwiches were plenty of food. I hope I am able to get back, there were so many things on the menu that I want to try."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bread (buttery baguette) is amazing and so soft. I ordered the chop cheese, south side, and fried pickles. The chop cheese was like a cheeseburger crafted into a heavenly sandwich. All of the meat was thinly sliced and there was no awkward pulling-the-whole-piece-of-salami-out-all-at-once issue. The customer service was fantastic, to top it all off. I had asked for water and I was offered a free bottled water since there was no soda machine. This customer service and amazing food makes for a great place to stop and eat! My only suggestion would be to extend the evening hours for those late night munchie cravings!"}
{"text":"We used Grubhub to place a delivery order a few days ago. This was the only place where we placed on order on Grubhub that was accurate. We ordered 1 Chopped Cheese Sandwich ($7.00), 1 Long Island Sandwich ($9.00) , 1 order of Onion Rings ($4.00), and 1 order of Pastrami Fries ($9.00). The food arrived hot and fresh and tasted amazing. I originally thought $9 was very expensive for an order of french fries but these things were amazing and piled high with toppings. Two of us could not finish them. I love their food and plan to visit the actual location in the future."}
{"text":"Great subs, good music and greeting employees. What more can you ask for. Come check them out if your on this side of town."}
{"text":"Let's start with the negatives. First the ambiance is blah and in need of cleaning. Expediting is way off; my onion rings came out very late. Third, the menu is not particularly East Coast although they do have pastrami and corned beef. They also offer a take on shaved beef that approximates pot roast. Now the positives. The food is pretty darn good. I had the fish sandwich and my wife ate a combo of the really spicy hot links and that shaved beef. The only part of either dish that didn't measure up was the French fries; blah. Oh, those late appearing onion rings. Next time I'll pass; too greasy, but decent flavor."}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches here and the guy who runs it Aziz was super friendly. I would definitely eat here again next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot if you're looking for a hardy New York style grub. From the sandwiches to the wing, everything we ordered was  on point. The food came out hot and fresh, the wings still crisp tossed in preferred sauce. We will be back again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, friendly, accommodating. Went with my parents after picking them up from the airport. We arrived 10 minutes before closing time. The lady at the counter was gracious, warm, and welcoming. I realized that they were about to close and was going to get my food to go, but was assured that we were no trouble and were welcome to eat there. Portions were generous, food was full of flavor. Able to see kitchen vents from the counter, they were spotless. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great new place.  Food was really good and service was top notch.  If you are in the area, you should check it out before it gets too popular and the lines get long."}
{"text":"Good is always spot on but this time we used Yelp's ordering service they said to get here at 740pm the Resturant's saying 810pm, too long to make someone wait on takeout with 2 kids in the car upset. No offer of any compensation."}
{"text":"Fast, easy and delicious. 
Very accommodating- made subs to order. Ingredients were fresh, behind the grill looked immaculate. Sausage sub was filled with hot cheesy goodness and my hubs ate his steak sub too quick for me to get a bite!
Fries were freshly put down, salt and light paprika on the plain. There are so many options for loaded French fries, i stuck with old reliable but I can't wait to try a more adventurous selection.
Overall, Looks like they really take pride in running the real-deal NY sub shop. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"This place is amazing The menu is easy to read We ordered the shroomy swiss and it was AMAZING! Fresh bread and ingredients. We also got the Baja fries and they were PERFECTION again everything was fresh The establishment was clean and they were friendly We are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Wide variety of sandwiches, unique fries & the onion rigs are the bomb!! I had the \"Empire Steak\" it was delicious, hot & juicy. Family had The Fatstack, Hot Chick, Cali Club & a Pops Chili Dog everyone loved their food!"}
{"text":"Sweetest people run this restaurant! The food was amazing and the service was phenomenal! I will be back."}
{"text":"Mmm, this place is fantastic! I came here with my girlfriend and the owner is friendly and pleasant. Inside looks great, brand new (opened just two weeks ago), the area and strip mall are a bit unsettling though. After a nice conversation with the owner we got The Cowboy, The Long Island, and Baja Fries. We loved all of it! The Baja Fries has a nice kick with the jalapeños. We'll be back again"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Haven't had a sandwich that good in a loooong time! Staff was very friendly and place was super clean. Definitely a new regular spot 
Thanks Bronx"}
{"text":"The best steak sandwich you can get in town! We come here every Thursday for the past year and it never gets old! The quality is unmatched! Very fresh ingredients And the bread is baked fresh daily! You have to come here and try the empire steak l!"}
{"text":"We went to Outta Bronx on a lark, taking our daughter and son-in-law to the airport.  We had the EMPIRE (Phiily) Cheese Steak, Chicken loaded french fries, spicy chicken sandwich and Fish and Chips."}
{"text":"I got a chopped cheese sandwich and a side of fries and boyyyyy was it good! 10/10 the meat was cooked perfectly and the cheese just made It all worth It. Definitely would come back and the workers were really kind and held conversations with everyone there and made sure we really enjoyed It. Really awesome environment."}
{"text":"Very small portioned meals. Otherwise the quality is excellent. Had there no jumbo wings and fries"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars hands down but service needs some improvement.

Placed an online order with coworkers for lunch.  We did not receive one of the items ordered, our sandwiches were mislabeled, and my Chopped Cheese Sandwich had mayo on it even though mayo was not in the description (another similar sandwich comes with mayo).   Nothing major but definitely a bummer when you get back to work and find things aren't correct."}
{"text":"I came here after I got an alert from Yelp. I initially passed the place because it is in a little shopping complex you wouldn't think to look. I ordered a three items for take out to share with a couple of friends for lunch and overall pleased.  I don't see how one person could eat any one of the items I ordered alone. The one thing you can say about this place is that they don't short change on the portions. The first item I ordered was the Shrimp Basket and I was very impressed with the size of the Shrimp and the fact that there is no tails on them. The second item I ordered was the NY Dog and it was really good overall. I was not a fan of the crushed tomato. There was an overwhelming amount of onions but just pulled them off. I was fascinated with the cuts they have on the hot dog. Something I have never seen before. The third item I ordered was loaded fries that had tons of stuff on it. 

PROS:
1. Food was fresh and tasted great
2. Place was very clean
3. Staff was really nice and welcoming
4. A lot of food for the money

CONS:
1. No tartar sauce or ketchup provided with Shrimp Basket
2. The hot dog bun was really soggy at the bottom. Two of us ate it with knife and fork. No way to pick it up and eat.

Overall, really nice place and will continue going back."}
{"text":"Hungry? You better be hungry for delicious food. Had the Chopped Cheese and my mouth was happy. The French baguette was soft and soaked up the juicy love of the meat. Sweetie had the Southside. It looks as good as it tasted. We started with the Hissy Fit Fries. So much food!  This place hasn't been open long but they have the recipe right. Make the effort to try this place and enjoy the friendly service."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Philly Cheesesteak for some time.  Outta Bronx showed up on my yelp.  Had the Empire Steak which was delicious.  The roll was nice and soft, generous portion, great tasting.  The place is clean too."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. They were super fast ..even though her app wasnt working right when I pre ordered it they still made my food fast.
I drove from 7th street Greenway just to eat here. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible, we got fried pickles and a meatball sub. I'm from CT and growing up in the northeast we had amazing, amazing Italian food. I found it gimmicky, not at all like something you'd eat in the Bronx. I'm biased, having high standards for subs. But, it just wasn't that great in my opinion."}
{"text":"The cilantro lime salad was fantastic. I think I will have to come back, with friends and family, and try some of their sandwiches, and Street fries. The people working there are very nice and helpful. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a decent cheesesteak sandwich in Phoenix since I got here last year. I FINALLY FOUND IT! The Empire Steak sandwich was ahhhhh-mazing! The fries were good too and hey have spicy ketchup :). They use boars head meats so I don't doubt that every sandwich is fire. This is my new cheat day spot. Every time."}
{"text":"Pizza fries, chopped cheese sub, pastrami sub, pizza sub...all was delicious, my boys gave it two thumbs up. The coleslaw very delicious. Will be back to try the po boy and the philly and philly fries and wings. Great service, fast and very very friendly! Door dash, Uber eats and grub hub were in and out as well."}
{"text":"Fabulous concept, menu, food and attitude by the owner. I love it when small businesses bring it all together to provide the customer a great overall experience"}
{"text":"Baguette was very good.  Steak sandwich was ok, but green peppers overpowered any other flavor.  Ruben was good but could have used more thousand."}
{"text":"The owner is a gem. I had no idea they were related to my other favorite NY deli over on the west side by my school district. I was in the area so had to check it out.  I went with the cheese, cheese that was so highly recommended.Normally I would never get anything like this and it had mustard on a meat sandwich. Wow, that is usually a big no no in Ny and for Mary. However, the sandwich was delicious. 

The place is small, the menu is limited and they do not have a bathroom but the food is good. If I lived close by I would be in there a lot."}
{"text":"Was just driving by and was intrigued by this \"New York Kitchen\". I walked in and was immediately greeted by the owner. There is a lot on their menu and it all sounds great, the owner was happy to help me decide and after talking with him I decided on their signature sandwich, the fat stack; brisket, hot links, fries and coleslaw. The bread was fluffy, the fries were crisp, everything came together perfectly; but warning: this is a very messy sandwich. Overall, very glad I stopped in and will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Huge portions. Will be back when back in the area! Had the chopped cheese sandwich and fried pickles. Yummy!"}
