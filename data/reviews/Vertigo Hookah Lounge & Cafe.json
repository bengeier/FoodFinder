{"text":"Went there with some coworkers unplanned and based solely on Yelp recommendations. Everything was great! The staff was helpful and accommodating. The owner was very friendly and hands on. The hookah was very nice, Turkish coffee was fantastic and we tried uma Ali for the first time ( I don't know how to spell it, but that was how it sounded to me)... great! There is no alcohol there so if you cannot live without it go to a bar, but you'll be missing out. If instead you like great, friendly service in a warm inviting environment then this is where you belong."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Moe our server/ host was extremely nice and gave us great recommendations. The strawberry/mango/ banana cocktails here is good& we didn't try out the food yet because we are earlier. Try the panty dropper& also the \"make it rain\" mix hookah! He is also introduced himself as the owner of Vertigo. We stayed in here for 3 hours and half & there's also a patio outside with pretty lights hanging over you. The venue is huge. They have different events on some nights. Great for private parties. In addition to that, there's a \"couple\" special where you can bring in your boo for a romantic chill date here. They can put white cloth and candles for you on a table to make it a great experience lol. We got stamp cards too woooo! :) will be coming back again to do some karaoke this time!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great people. Their patio seatings are cosy and nice, its THE place to go to in winter. I wouldn't mind going 7 days a week. needless to say I enjoy their chicken shwarmas and the Kabab sandwich as well.   I definitely recommend trying out their fruit bowl hookahs!"}
{"text":"The place is wonderful. There hookah are amazing fan of double apple than it's the place you looking for. The food is delicious and serviced until late night. Service is fabulous. If you want to hangout with friends, it's a most. I just love going there every time. We had a birthday there it was awesome they take care of everything. I would really recommend the place you won't forget the experience."}
{"text":"The place is very nice and clean. There were not many people and it was a little quite, but i assume it will be busier in weekends (i was there wednes night)"}
{"text":"Great place, very attentive staff. Smooth flavors and great music! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday on a first date. For my first time here I was really nervous that my date or me wouldn't like it but we ended up having a great time. I definitely recommend this place for couples it's very cozy and intimate and the music wasn't too loud. A plus was the great play list. I enjoyed the hookah we got free coal refills the guy that work there was really nice and the atmosphere and decore we're really nice as well. We got the raspberry grape and loved it. It's a great low key place I would go again."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! The owners treat everyone like family and they do an excellent job of creating a genuine environment to hang out, meet new people, and enjoy awesome food. The events with live music and dancing is a must! If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Great place!  Really clean, good hookah and overall great environment.  I told the server that my birthday is coming up and he told me they'll have a birthday cake and hookah service FOR FREE for the night.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just had the greatest night here! Mo was super attentive and made us a delicious hookah... I believe it was called the \"panty dropper\"? It was delicious and very smooth.   We were lucky enough that some of the regulars and workers had a jam session while we were there, and they made some really beautiful music. Eventually they started doing karaoke, and after a night of hookah, dancing, and singing, I already feel like a regular after my first visit! Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night. It was nice, quiet, and relaxing. We all very much enjoyed the experience. The service was wonderful and the staff was very attentive to us. We met the owner and he explained some of the great events coming up on the weekends! they have a lot to offer:) We also had some DELICIOUS desserts and tea along with the hookah. They have very fair pricing and their happy hour is great! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place offers great service. You can sit outside or inside. The owners are good people and always welcoming. The hookah there is amazing and has different flavors. It's a great place."}
{"text":"First time to Vertigo and I'm from California with a ton of different lounges. This by far my favorite. The owner is a well established man, who keeps his customers happy. I would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Started our Halloween festivities with a visit to Vertigo.  It was perfect!  Super chill...great music and vibe, and great hookah flavors.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and helpful with suggestions for unique hookah flavors to try.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!! Great service, great price, clean and delicious hookah. ~yelp wants more wants more words so um im putting more words"}
{"text":"Best place to hang out with friends. ... cool, nice and fun place. .. it's great place for late nights ... they have nice offer from time to time.. love it"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner and then enjoyed the lounge for a while where we ate a middle eastern desert and a tea.  The dinner was tremendous and we received an explanation on what to order and the way to eat.  This we assume is really traditional middle eastern food.  It was tasty and we ended up taking a bunch home.  The service was friendly and the pace of the meal was relaxed.  The lounge was not crowded but we were early and really went for the food first and foremost.  If you want good middle eastern food in the southeast valley this is an excellent place.  You will find the lounge comfortable and probably very active with some of the events they hold."}
{"text":"This is a great hookah lounge! With a wide open room and patio open to use, you have a lot of options. The owner helps attend customers and all employees are polite and helpful!  The smoothies are delicious and we asked for the orange fruit bowl with \"make it rain\", and it was delicious and smooth!  If you need any siggestions, definitely ask! We didn't have food, but it smelled amazing and is offered late into the night. The one negative that I would mention is the couches are so low that it makes it somewhat uncomfortable to sit in. If there were better couches, I'd give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a couple a buddies of mine, definitely worth coming back to. Loved the atmosphere and the people working here! Decent prices too. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a chill hookah bar to chill at."}
{"text":"The best hookah I've ever had in the U.S, they really know how to make good hookahs. liked the atmosphere and the music, they shifted between live Arabic music and pop music which was really cool. The owners were very friendly and attentive. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We wanted to finish a night with friends at a fun place and looked for the best reviewed hooka bar, so we found this place.  The service was not the 5 star standard we were expecting, it was not attentive per the previous comments. It is a good place for regulars, but for newcomers we would not recommend it. The ratings shown do not accurately depict the experience you will have upon your visit.   Hadeel was our very uninviting server for the night. Forgetting our order, and leaving our group unattended for the majority of our stay. When I asked about their listed coupon for 10% off our order, as they had listed; she had explained how the restaurant didn't open at 6pm that day (?) and the owners were out to vacation (?), and she was that the only person working for the time while they were away which meant she could not honor the coupon (?). Just we had a better interaction.  We won't be going be back. The 5-star ratings exaggerate the experience."}
{"text":"Extremely good customer service!! The owner Mo was so friendly and helpful. He came up and introduced himself and talked to me and my friend for a while, letting us know about the events and specials. We were very surprised when he threw in a free dessert at the end (which was delicious by the way). I am 100% going to come back soon and I would highly recommend going here!!!"}
{"text":"The owner is so attentive and welcoming! The hookah was amazing, and he gave us Om Ali on the house-which is the most delicious dessert I've had!   It has great aesthetic and the regulars there are very kind!  Hookah flavors are fresh and they will assist you with any issues!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with couple friends cause we were looking for an outdoor hookah place in the area and found this on yelp! The place is so chill and have both outdoor and indoor area. Even though they were playing some musics, but it wasn't really loud so you could totally just chill&smoke. We ordered blue mist on orange bowl and the owner recommended us to get the panty-dropper on an orange bowl. I'm not a big fan of hookah myself, but those two are UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! And they're really cheap compared to other hookah bars I've been, so another thumb up for Vertigo! The owner was extremely friendly and he told us a lot about the events they have on both weekdays&weekends and got us the punch card to get a free hookah for every 5 hookahs! Definitely looking forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The owner and employees are amazing. Great vibe. The hookah and music is good! They are very attentive! The Om Ali is amazing. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, or may I say beyond excellent! The owners themselves came to introduce their selves to me and my husband. The waiters and the owner kept checking to make sure every thing was going perfectly well. They ensured our evening was going smoothly and we were having a good time the whole time. During our night there, the owner offered us a table on the patio since the weather was great and it was an excellent choice to move there. The music was nice and the whole atmosphere was beautiful. I  so glad we went there last night. The hookah is great, probably the best I've had in Arizona so far. I had the Umm Ali for dessert and it tasted really good. All in all, I love the place and would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I love this place !!! The owner is so nice and sweet and makes you feel like family! The atmosphere is very homy, the food is amazing. I usually order the cocktail which is a layer of mango strawberry and banana milk. The shawarma is AH MA ZING!!! Taste just like shawarma from back home!! And don't get me started on the Kunafa!! Taste just like my aunts Kunafa... YUMMMM!! I love their vertigo special hookah it's very pure and strong and gives u a good buzz lol"}
{"text":"Vertigo aptly named after Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 thriller is a great place! Terrific atmosphere, friendly, fast welcoming service. Food so good, you can't stop eating even when you full and hookahs so relaxing you won't want to leave.   Try the \"Special Vertigo\" Shisha :)   I highly recommend grabbing a few friends or even a quiet date and enjoying all Vertigo has to offer!"}
{"text":"Amazing vibes in the lounge, perfect place to go relax and smoke a nice bowl of hookah. Music is always satisfying as well as the food they offer. It stays open pretty late so it's a good place to go hang out with friends for sure. The owner is so welcoming and warmhearted. If the amazing hookah and environment doesn't make you want to come back the people who work there definitely will. One of my favorite chill spots for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been there in this place lots of time, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was really enjoyable, and the music was definitely wonderful, waiters were friendly. Highly recommended you guys to try this place. Middle East food from the partner restaurant was delicious. Hookah there is the best hookah ever."}
{"text":"For those of you that are lucky enough to know Kazi H. from Yelp Phoenix, you will know that she is the malekeh of all things hookah.  After hanging out at an outdoor festival, grabbing a bite, and knocking back some brews, we decided to take the one hookah-virgin in our group out for some shisha!  A quick Yelp search later and here we are.  We got to Vertigo at 6PM on the dot which happens to be their opening time.  The doors were locked, a huge group of guys sat inside smoking, and it was awkward after making some eye contact with them.  They still weren't getting up.  After standing around for another minute, one of the guys finally came over and opened the door.  \"Um, are you guys open?\" I asked tentatively.  \"I don't know.  I don't work here.\"  Okaaaaay... so we looked at each other for a few seconds, muttering softly to each other about going to another place down the street when a friendly lady comes to the door and welcomes us in.  She was apparently a bit confused at the time and didn't even know they were suppose to be opened!  We were told to sit anywhere so we grabbed some couch off to the side where the group of guys stared at us.  After browsing the menu, we decided on strawberry and a few minutes later, the lady comes over with our hookah and \"starts\" it for us, sans tip.  Internal screaming of why this lady had her lips all over our hookah was quickly shushed as the hookah-virgin showed enthusiasm to try it despite the stranger's spittle.  I'm down.  We later saw with another group that came in that this establishment apparently likes to start the hookah for their customers although the younger gents used a tip to do so.  So what can be said about this place?  It's small, sparsely decorated, played some great music, had televisions playing sports, and the prices are decent.  I think it was $12 for our hookah.  They also serve food and are affiliated with the restaurant next door.  In fact, if you have to use the restroom, you walk through a door that leads you to the restaurant.  Would I be back?  Well...  All in all, I think I've been spoiled by the place my Kazi goes to --- that place has glass hookah which makes things sooo smooth and clean.  I will never cheat on Kazi or her Dukedom again."}
{"text":"We went for opening.  Nice service but place was very slow.  Food options were prefect for late night snack w some tea.  I did not try the hookah this time."}
