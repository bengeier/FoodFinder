{"text":"The restaurant has over 70 types of pizzas to choose from! Have you ever had that many choices before?

The restaurant has enough tables for everyone, with some booths, and a large brick oven at the very back.

The size of the pizzas are all one size - roughly a medium size. It is enough for one person (I think). It wasn't too small, since we were both full by the end of our meal.

My pizza was GREAT. All the ingredients were fresh, and the dough was so chewy! I'm not a fan of pizza crusts, but I loved finishing them as well. Halfway through, I didn't eat the crusts, solely because I wouldn't have had enough space for the rest of my pizza. I'm not sure if I'll order the same one again next time I'm in Il Focolaio, but that's not because I didn't like the pizza! There are just too many that I want to try. Next up on my list is their arugula pizza.

If you're looking for some new styles of pizzas to try, this would be the right place! Having been in the business since 1984, they really know what they're doing! They also deliver, so if you're not in the mood to go out in the cold, give them a call."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. We are from Toronto and went here based on reviews. Great toppings. We liked the \"carre Phillips \" pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place, it's my go-to take-out/delivery/dine-in pizza joint. 

As previously mentioned, there are over 70 different items to try, and I'm on a mission to try them all! The ingredients are always really fresh and the crust is thin and wood-oven baked to perfection. So far, the stand-out pizza I've had is the smoked salmon pizza: sauce, capers, red onions, mozzarella, and fresh smoked salmon. I've only tried one of their calzones (the broccoli and blue cheese one), which was good, but not amazing- stick to the pizzas. 

Prices are reasonable and with such a diverse menu, you'll definitely want to keep going for more!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was awesome! From the moment my friend went in to reserve a table just as rush hour was ending, staff weren't overwhelmed, they were extremely welcoming! Two gentleman held both doors open and made way for us considering a had my stroller. They sat us down, made things really comfortable, offered my daughter a high chair. Service was excellent! The atmosphere is perfect for great lunch experience. I needed to change my daughter, one of the lovely lady receptionists came down stairs to the washroom and made sure I had space to change my daughter considering the restaurant has no baby diaper changing table. I was actually quite worried when I looked this place up to visit when in Montreal, but the staff really made it easy. Pizza was delicious, enough for two to share, if getting a salad too! Dough doesn't leave you bloated, and the pizza sauce didn't cause heartburn, so authentic!"}
{"text":"Fine pizzas and LOTS of them to choose from. Super friendly for kids and great, attentive service. Wonderful pizza joint with a nice, crowded patio. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Lots of great vegetarian options, amazing salad & great pizzas. They also have a really nice patio overlooking the square for a nice day, although the tables on the patio are very close together (we actually ended up having conversations with the tables on either side of us).

Anyways, had a great meal and would definitely recommend. Right in the center of Montreal with lots of shopping and touring to do around it. 

It has a big yellow awning that honestly doesn't look very promising from afar, but once you get closer, it has a lovely interior and atmosphere to eat in, so don't be surprised!"}
{"text":"HUGE selection of pizzas, and some other Italian options. It might be because it was the lunch rush (at 1:30PM?), but the staff wasn't particularly friendly. My friend also ordered a salad, but had to ask for the bread that was supposed to come with it - and ended up getting cold, pizza crust with sauce instead of the expected garlic bread. Otherwise, food was delicious, and I might come back."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Great prices for portions and great sangria. Great service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Not what I expected based on the rating. Admittedly we had dinner salads but mine was the signature option and had only a hint of any dressing. Our waiter did not deliver our plates (which initially went to the wrong table much to the confusion of the folks who got them) and never once checked on us despite a light crowd for early dinner. My wife enjoyed her choice quite a bit more. Though she found the restrooms a bit of a challenge to locate in the basement. 2-1/2 at best for us combined, 1-1/2 for me."}
{"text":"I read the reviews, went and sure enough it was very good. The place was crowded at lunch time, but I didn't have to wait long for a table for one. I had a hard time choosing. I wish they had 5 specials to chose from. This kind of generic italian pizza menu kills me. I had #23, which was excellent. Nice crust, tasty sauce, just a little spicy. I'm sure they're all good. I think I'll read the menu on line before I go next time. The waiters could have been a bit more attentive, refilled my water glass, offered me condiments. And the place was really loud. Wow. But I'll be back to try some of the other pizzas."}
{"text":"Cannot comment on the ambience, since we ordered in.  It was a Monday night, and apparently many restaurants in the downtown area are closed on Monday's, so we yelped and found this resto who would deliver to the hotel, even though it was about 15 minutes to closing time.  (That was very nice of them!)

We ordered the portobello and olive pizzas.  They arrived quickly and piping hot.  They are not stingy with toppings, which is awesome.  Our only complaint (if I can call it a complaint), is that it was too cheesy.  But that was our fault.  We made the mistake of ordering it with extra cheese, thinking that it would be like extra cheese from the chains.  Definitely not!  

And to help digest, we did go for a walk in the neighborhood, and happened to stumble on the restaurant itself, and it was crowded even though it was after it was closed.  Always a good sign :)"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The best I've had in a while. Haven't had pizza like this since my NY days. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews but, my pizza came out missing an ingredient. I didn't notice but the waiter did and brought me a new replacement pizza. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Ordered the eggplant, zucchini, etc., slice. It was great! All the vegetables were grilled nicely. The pizza crust itself was a bit soggy but what could you expect with all those wonderful veggies. The pepperoni slice wasn't soggy and tasted great (maybe ask for extra sauce). 

Also, if you order delivery, just know the size is a personal pizza size."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to pizza country (Italy) and this pizza here (pizzaresto II Focolaio) is #2 of all the pizza we had In Italy. We had lots of pizza and this place has amazing pizza (only thing better was in Capri). Excellent food, great service (Rafael was the best server ever)! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a delivery from them,  got a pizza and almond cake. Almond cake was great ( a bit too sweet ) ; pizza was a bit too cold. Quite tasty. May be it's a better option to eat inside. 
The delivery man was extremely nice and delivery took a good 40-50 min."}
{"text":"what you need to know about the atmosphere, service, and food :O)

Atmosphere: Go, with God's Speed, and even with you eyes closed - this place is an institution!  Il Focolaio is always lively, always bustling, and a place were you look around and see people enjoying being there.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill pizzeria ~ this is a place we're you'll feel (even for a little while) that you're somewhere other than where you've come from.  Il Focolaio is usually very very busy at lunch time (it is near the heart of Montreal's business district), as such seating is hard to come by.  Unfortunately, the place (understandably) does not take reservations.  If this is your first time going, make sure to pass by at dinner time or a little later - say 6:30-9:00. 

Service:  The service at Il Focalaio is always (always) courteous, and quick - but equally down to a point.  SInce the place isn't very big (relatively), and its often at or near capacity, the waiters (mostly young), must do their jobs quickly and efficiently.  They're great at what they do.

Food: Go! You will walk out giddy and satiated ... not unlike a successful first date! Be prepared to sit down at Focolaio and spend time agonizing over which of the 75 different kinds of pizza pies you would like (even those who've become regulars - still ponder the choices!).  Cooked on a stone hearth with fresh ingredients that are as diverse are they are plenty, pizzas come to your table pipping hot on a thin crust.  Beer is on tap, and wines are also available.  The menu does contain some other no-pizza choices like salads, pastas, and lasagna - but let's not kid ourselves - the pizza is why you want to be there! 

Not a place to grab a slice and go - you'll want the whole pie!"}
{"text":"Nice pizza
Excellent crust

They have almost 100 variations of toppings

You can also get organic lactose free cheese, abd omega 3 crust

I ordered one with Rocca
I loved it

They also have a terrace

Very friendly waiters"}
{"text":"The pizza and the ambience here were so good that we ate here just about every night while we were in Montreal!  Waiters were fantastic and efficient, pizza menu had just about every combination you could imagine - i think 80 or so - and then some (some unique ones for sure!).  A night or two my teen and I shared a small pizza, and there were just fine with that though I felt a little embarrassed as our bill was kind of low (gave a big tip to the server to make up for it!).  

The outdoor seating made me feel like we were in Europe.  Reasonable priced, fast, and really tasty!"}
{"text":"This place probably comes up the most when search for pizza in Montreal so I had to come. Came on labor day, around 7pm, and there was a huge line up out the door. Normally I don't like lines, but in this case it means the food is probably amazing!

Got seated pretty quickly only a 20 min wait, and even when I was seated that line up was still there with more and more people adding too it, which got me even more excited to try their pizza.

Their selection is HUGE, I loved that a lot. I got a la bomba and 4 cheese pizza. Very tasty, PERFECT amount of cheese, great toppings, awesome flavor. Staff way very nice too despite being busy as all hell.

Would come back."}
{"text":"We're both from New York so we're probably going to be some of the toughest critics for pizza but my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our mushroom and prosciutto pizzas. Friendly service and we got to watch the world cup match to boot. This place will make you forget you're having lots of carbs!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!  I decided to check it out while staying in Montreal recently because it had positive reviews and was also right around the corner from my hotel.  Their delicious, thin-crust pizzas are probably about 10 inches in diameter.  Each one is the perfect size for one person.  Service was very friendly and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is lively--it reminded me of a European cafe.  

Also, Il Focolaio has the distinction of actually being open for dinner on Sundays, which is slightly uncommon in Montreal.  (Many restaurants close around 4 pm on Sunday.)  So, after wandering around the city for about an hour on a Sunday at 6 pm, not able to find any place to eat, I ended up coming back here for the second night in the row.  Luckily the food is so good that I didn't mind!

Be aware that they have a TON of different pizzas--something like 85 different varieties.  (Most of them are just different combinations of the same toppings, but still.)  The first night I had the Romana (tomatoes, mozzarella, parmesan, basil, oregano, garlic, olive oil), which was great.  The second night I had the Fa Bene (mushrooms, black olives, spinach, mozzarella) which was also good.  I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here, so pick your favorite toppings and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Came on a Saturday night, there was a line up. We knew we had to come back. Went the next day for lunch and food was fantastic!!! Had Fa Bene pizza. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious but the reason I am highly highly recommending this restaurant is the wait staff.  We went last night with a large group including my two and six year old sons who were impatient and tired after a long day of sightseeing.  The restaurant was very busy with Friday night customers.  A constant stream of pizzas and people seemed to be moving through the large and packed dining room that was buzzing with noise.  My older son was fascinated watching all the activity around the pizza oven and decided to take it upon himself to go to one of the managers and ask if he could work as a waiter since he was \"faster than a cheetah\" and could really help out.  He was so crestfallen when he was told that he was too young that he came back to our table and sobbed.  A short time later the manager came by with a waiter's shirt and gave it to my son telling him that he was welcome to join the team next year when he was a little older.  This wasn't some old tshirt but a brand new high quality polo shirt.  My son was so happy it made his night.  I was really so touched that during their Friday night crush when the restaurant was literally rushing dozens of pizzas out of the oven every few minutes - that the manager would take time out of the swirling craziness around him to make a disappointed little boy feel better.  All of the other waiters were so kind as well.  Really they could have just treated my son with annoyance - a little kid bothering them when they were so busy - but they were so understanding and encouraging when they didn't have to be at all.  The pizza is delicious, I had a vegetarian pizza with a crust that was charred perfectly.  But I am giving this restaurant 5 stars because their staff went above and beyond last night and treated my son with such kindness it really touched me.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Coming here for lunch during the week (especially a Friday) is not a good idea because it gets super packed.  When you do get a seat it also feels like you are crammed like sardines.  

However, the pizza is decent but a bit overpriced for what you get at 14 dollars on average.  It is very oily so if you are a bit of a health freak then i would recommend you dab your pizza with your napkin first before eating it."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be avoided. They refuse everyone service. Took them 2 hours to \"prepare\" my iced tea, and in the end they said that they ran out."}
{"text":"I ordered #68. A La Griglia which is a vegetarian choice. The crust was great and the pizza was full of vegetable which was delicious but I think it could be a bit more tasty. The atmosphere was fine, nothing very fancy."}
{"text":"Good pizza - had the one w sausage, green peppers, mushroom - but was expecting better given all the raving reviews. Sausage was not sliced thin enough. Just an average pizza. Not a bad experience but would not trip over myself to go back. You could probably find better/more authentic pizza places around MTL"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!  The servers were especially gracious and attentive.  We sat on the patio overlooking a city square.  The best, most authentic Italian wood fired pizza that we've had in Montreal. Every bite of the pizza was heavenly.  We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.   Over 70 choices.  Both my daughter and I loved it.  Service was fast and they have an outdoor sidewalk patio looking onto a nice plaza."}
{"text":"It's summer so perhaps it's not the best time for pizza... Oh who am I kidding, it's always pizza-time! And this place knows how to do it right. 

I was impressed by not only the range of pizzas, but food came out at lightning speed, the service was top-notch, there's a lovely terrace, and you can get a 1/2 litre of good sangria for $13. 

My friend and I ordered two pizzas (planning to share them) and they were brought out \"pre-split\" so that we each had 1/2 of each pizza on our own plates already, which we really appreciated. I'm looking forward to coming back with the husband so that I can explore more of their very extensive menu!"}
{"text":"I love the location, right beside the beautiful Square Phillips. Service is fast. Pizza tastes amazing, depending on the one you choose. The 4 cheese is really good!"}
{"text":"Good delicious pizzas. So many good choice of different ingredients to top on that nice hot thin crust. Then top with their home made hot pepper oil. My favourite is number 8 St Daniel :-)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken pesto pizza and it has got to be one of the best in-restaurants I've ever had. The pizza was packed with ingredients. It is a bit pricey for a pizza but since it's so filling, you can probably split it with a friend if you're not trying to keep some for a midnight snack to go with that Netflix movie ;)

Oh, and did I mention friendly staff? Tight in spacing and the place is almost always packed."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza encore une fois! Juste un peu trop bruyant."}
{"text":"Can be hard to grab a table on a busy night--huge selection of pizzas.  Crust is tasty, crispy, and on the thinner side.  Salads are good--not great and come with some small slices of tomato pie on the side.  Not fancy, but it's always nice to relax and enjoy a meal outside."}
{"text":"Visited last night, which was a Monday and the place was busy with a mix of families, dates and students. A good sign!

The waiter I had was very smiley which is always nice! I ordered n. 40 while my partner ordered n. 27 minus the green peppers. If you like pizza with lots of cheese and generous toppings than you need to come here!  I love prosciutto and there was plenty of it on my pizza! 

My partner's n. 27 was a little off and we concluded it was because WE made an adjustment. We think we would have liked the pizza as stated on the menu. Having said that, I'd suggest not making tweaks to your order. There are so many options to choose from on the menu! You're bound to find something you like!

One thing to note is that the tomato sauce was very scarce and bland tasting on the pizzas. If the presence of tomato sauce on your pizza is important to you than you may be disappointed by the pizza here, but only slightly. There's just so much good going on otherwise. Ultimately, that is why I am giving this place 4 stars, and also because the menu lacks appetizer options. 

All in all, this is a pizza spot that is a favourite among many people I know and I can understand why! It's definitely in my top 5!"}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza often but this wood burning stove Italian style pizza was awesome extremely fresh and the dough was delish"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here and I wasn't impressed. My gf likes this place and recommended we order from here, so we did. We picked up the pizzas and my first impression was that they looked small. They indeed were a little too small for the $15/each that we paid. The pizzas were alright but nothing special at all. I had bigger and better pizzas elsewhere. My gf said that when you eat at the restaurant,  the pizzas seem bigger which I found strange. She's eaten there before and said that they definitely were bigger and better at the restaurant. I guess if you're thinking of trying this pizza, it would be best to eat at the restaurant vs take-out."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza!!!! Looked up best pizza in downtown Montreal and here it was. Extensive selection and when I asked for the most popular pizza there was no hesitation. I was asked do you like meat or veggies or both and spicy or not and then were provided with three selections. We chose #62 and it was fantastic!! Thin crispy crust and lots of toppings - served piping hot!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for fast delivery to our hotel over Easter weekend and Pizza Il Focolaio was amazing. It was tough to decide from the lengthy list of interesting choices, but we ended up ordering 3 and getting 1 free. The wood-fired oven makes for a fantastic crust and we enjoyed our selections. Plus, the delivery -- which was supposed to be 45 minutes -- turned out to be way faster, even though they just started our order when we called. Deliveryman (Pete? Paul?) was incredibly friendly and gracious. All around a great eat-in dinner choice for our weekend trip."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza at a busy spot in downtown Montreal. Fresh ingredients and fast service despite how busy the place was for lunch! The pizza was wood-fired. I would definitely recommend this place for its great patio, relaxed atmosphere, and fast service! I had the Senza Salsa which was a great indulgence. Paired with the great wheat beer on tap - comfort food perfection! Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have had a few bad experiences with this place, but the good definitely outweighs the bad! The pizzas are diverse and delicious, and the place is nice. A must-try if you have money to spend!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is just WOW...love love love this restaurant...I had the salmon pizza and it was delicious...the crust is perfectly cooked in a brick oven...service is fast our waiter was very friendly, helpful and attentive...highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great tasting, reasonably priced food ready only minutes after we ordered. When we arrived there was a standing line and the joint was packed so it's apparently no secret how good this place is. We decided we would rather order takeout and eat back at our hotel than wait for a table so we took a look at the menu while waiting in line, ordered at the bar, and were on our way only minutes later. If you like Italian style pizza cooked in a tradition pizza oven give this place a try."}
{"text":"Wow! This was some of the best pizza that I have had in my life. Seriously.

I am so sad that we discovered this place on the last night of our 2 week trip to Montreal. I would have ordered many more times. We ordered two pizzas for delivery to our hotel and it arrived very quickly and was piping hot. The wood fired oven certainly makes the difference between this pizza and other places. Perfect crust, just the right amount of crispyness and actual bread. 

The only thing I wish I would have paid more attention to in the yelp reviews was the size of the pizzas. They are fairly close to a personal size pizza. Between my husband and 2 kids we were fighting over who got the last slices. We definitely could have ordered one more between all of us."}
{"text":"La meilleur pizza du centre ville de Montréal."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for a night and found this place and did it hit the spot. The restaurant is small and busy but the food is amazing. We ordered three pizza, as they are 10\" pies. The food took just over 15 minutes to come to the table. The first bite was just as great as the last bite. There was no wait at the door and we showed up at 7:45 on a Saturday night. There is outdoor seating but we chose to eat inside. I highly suggest you try this place if you are in the mood for great pizza"}
{"text":"Really good Pizza and a nice atmosphere on the patio. We went on a Friday evening around 7pm and got a table on the patio within 10 mins. Server was nice and attentive even with a busy patio. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"On vacation and was thrilled to know my family of 5 could get a reservation with only a few hours' notice. With 3 picky eaters under 10 years old I needed a family-friendly atmosphere within walking distance of our hotel with a good menu but also a nice wine selection and atmosphere. Not only did we get it all, but our sweetheart waiter, who knew we couldn't even try to order in French, suggested a dulce de leche cheese cake that rivals any dessert I've ever had. 

Only drawback is that we're only in town for 1 more night and my kids are desperate to go back but I want variety! I see a tough decision coming tomorrow between great food and mom's desire to explore the city more."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Best pizza in Montreal in my opinion. I go for the brick oven kind... Where you can even taste a little charcoal on the dough! One pizza is perfect for one person with a good appetite. Service is very friendly, which is so important especially when you are so busy. And they also deliver which is a big plus. I also like that you can see the chefs cooking the pizzas. 

THE BAD: The restaurant space is not impressive. Tables are close together. Little older look. No real \"nice decor\". They have TV's but it plays some DVD loop of scenic landscape. I would go here twice as often if they were airing sports games! Second negative is I think they are overpriced. Definitely not order-every-Friday-night-pizza... But I would if it was more affordable! If you order the salads, ask for dressing on the side. My Caesar is usually pretty loaded with dressing which I don't prefer. 

Overall - if you're craving delicious fresh pizza, go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and a couple of friends were walking in the cold and we saw the restaurant and decided to try is and we took a chicken salad with the pizza and it was amazing the crust was perfect the salad was excellent and to top it off the service was great will go back for sure !"}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood for pizza so when my sister asked me if I wanted to come meet her and a co-worker for lunch, I said sure. It was a scorching hot day and I have to admit pizza was a little heavy for that type of weather but that did not stop me from indulging in a now, new favorite spot.

I already knew parking would be difficult but I was lucky enough to find a choice spot that was seconds away from the front door, which made me very happy:) 

I met my sister and her friend  on the  terrasse, it was packed and there was nice canopy on top of it to shade you from the sun which was certainly needed.
.

I quickly browsed a long list of pizza choices but I wasn't in an adventurous mood and ordered a tried and true favorite, a Margherita pizza.

We sipped our iced teas and enjoyed the beautiful day and scenery. There was a row of Bixi bikes across the street and a guy hopped on a bike (parked in the row) and started frantically pedaling. Guess he was getting some exercise in because he stayed on it for awhile:)

It is a lively place and there was soon a lineup of people waiting for a table outside so it was good that we got there before the rush.

Our pizzas soon arrived and they looked very cheesy and smelled amazing. My first bite sealed the deal, mmmm,  delicious!  Thin, crispy crust, very very cheesy with fresh  tomatoes and basil. I had 2 pieces and brought the rest home to enjoy for supper but that was not to be because I devoured them like a piggy, on my drive home! That's always a great sign:)


In a nutshell, a clean, casual place with with pizza that satisfied my craving perfectly, a new favorite!"}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza à Montréal, la pâte sur feu de bois excellente !!!!!! près du centre des spectacles."}
{"text":"I was already sold when I saw the paper menu listing over 70 pizza choices with varied toppings and saw the tasty looking pizzas waft by on the packed terrace! 

Pizza was delicious with a great light crust. I had the Renaissance; spinach, mozzarella, tomato sauce and crispy spicy pancetta. The pancetta was fresh, tasty and plentiful and I devoured the entire thing! 

Wine menu had standard bottles at very reasonable prices.

I can't wait to eat my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Had a pizza and salad in in 2 separate visits.  The food was good.  Value was fair given it is a tourist area.  Indoor-outdoor seating.  The staff over all was nice but the first time we we were they they would not serve just a beer even though we were going to came back later for dinner.  Said that was the law but not so sure about that.  Still wound up going for dinner and the pizza was pretty good.  Next night got the salad.  It was pretty good also.  I give high marks for fast carry out."}
{"text":"Good but not great... Ordered the margarita with eggplant and the eggplant seemed raw. The Hawaiian was better. Seats are uncomfortable but the service was nice... Ok but don't think I will make it back..."}
{"text":"Really great pizza with delicious crust and lots of cheese and toppings. Very fast delivery to our hotel. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A lot of options, great ambiance, friendly staff, delicious pizza! Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find good pizza in Montreal. It's either too greasy, to doughy, there's not enough cheese, or some other reason. Trust me when I say that this pizza place delivers (haha get it?). I've only been to the actual location once, but it was beautiful, with outdoor and indoor seating. Their delivery boxes have this awesome logo on them and both the delivery and eat in pizza are amazing. It's even good to eat the next day (just not cold, you sickos)."}
{"text":"Pollo Nostro and Primavera pizzas were delicious! Add some hot sauce (olive oil with dissolved green peppers) to the pizza and have at it! The waiters are very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Montreal for 15$. I've been here a few times and it never seizes to amaze me how incredible wood oven pizza can be. I've never been much of a fan but I started working across the street from this place and everyone kept telling me it was the best pizza in Montreal so I finally gave it a shot and never looked back!"}
{"text":"Ce soir c'était pizza, et le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que c'est l'endroit pour!! Une quantité impressionnante de pizza proposée et y'en a pour tout les goûts!!

Personnellement j'ai pris la quatre fromages avec supplément de saucisses italiennes. La pizza est vraiment de bonne taille et très bonne, de plus le supplément est vraiment en quantité! 

Pas d'attente pour moi, et un service très bien! 
Par contre seulement 4 étoiles parce que 20$ sans les frais je trouve cela un peu chère malgré les points positifs! 
J'y retournerais très certainement!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing breakfast at Mike's, lunch at il focolaio saved my taste buds. I had the volcano calzone, wife and kids had various pizzas.....it was amazing. Ate so much I skipped dinner."}
{"text":"There is an incredible variety of pizza to choose from - something like 80 options if I'm not mistaken, covering a wide variety of ingredients and toppings. The location also merits a mention, during the summer months, this area of town is buzzing with activity as there's always some sort of festival going on. There's also a park just in front. A warm summer's day, the smell of pizza wafting through the square, watching locals and tourists walking by, you could well imagine yourself in Rome. 

I should mention that I consider this place slightly pricey given the quantity of pizza served. Depending on your budget, you may or may not agree. However, I definitely think this place is worth a visit at least once, preferably in the summer, if only just for the experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to this restaurant on a Friday night. The weather was beautiful so we decided to sit outside. The outside area was a little crowded. You can tell they try to fit as many tables and people in their patio as they can but it didn't bother us at all.  They also have an English menu which what was good, since we don't know any French. 

This restaurant has a huge selection of different pizzas. They also have a huge selection of toppings. It can be a little overwhelming when deciding what to order. It took us a while to decide what we wanted. 

So we finally decided and we ordered our pizza. We sat and talk for a while and enjoyed the nice weather. The pizza arrived pretty quickly and it was great. The crust was perfect. We had so many toppings on our pizza that we had to eat it with a fork and knife. I would've gave this restaurant 5 stars, but it only gets 4 because the service could have been better. I had to flag the waiter down on numerous occasion just to get more water. With that said, I definitely would go back to this place the next time i'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pizza was way too salty and covered with that good old tasteless industrial mozzarella. Service was not even on par with most cheap pizza spot."}
{"text":"The best place for pizza i've been ever. I wonder why I havent gone recently?
Excellent service; the staff is polite and smiling, and very fast.
They have an incredible selection of pizzas, something like 75, wich is a ridiculous big  selection. I had a seafood pizza and it was mouth watering.... Also the prices are lower than i would expect for this level of food and service. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Fully deserves the rave reviews I had heard about this place. Will definitely go back. Packed with people who enjoy great food. Service is friendly. Had trouble selecting from the 75 choices available. Opted for the 5 cheese pizza - flavorful and generous. A rewarding meal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you have ever liked Pizza(even once), then they have something you would love. They have over 75 different Pizzas to choose from and you can't go wrong with any one of them. 
Great Pizza, freshest ingredients, great vibe, friendly wait staff..what else do you need?
This is my favourite Pizza place in all of Montreal and I have tried lots from Amelio's to Pendeli's and from Bottega to Napoletana.

The crust is thin and well done, the vegetables are nicely baked but not burnt, the tomato sauce is fresh and not canned, decent wines to pair with..you're in for a foodgasm my friend. Head over when you get a chance. I have moved over to Toronto few months ago, but always make a plan to visit here whenever I find myself in Montreal."}
{"text":"Wow! Can I just have a review that says wow? No, I have to qualify that wow. We looked for something to eat in Apple maps, and Il Focolaio showed up. The reviews were good and the photos looked better.
It's a busy restaurant, but there is seating inside and out, so chances are there is a seat waiting for you. The tables are close together, but I didn't really notice - except when it came to admiring other people's' dinners. 
I ordered a beer and a Ratatouille pizza. I never liked eggplant, but I liked everything else, so what the heck. My daughter ordered a calzone (can't remember which one). Again she didn't like blue cheese, but thought she would give it a try. 
My pizza was amazing!! Lots of vegetables and slathered in yummy cheese. The crust was fantastic - tasted home made. 
My daughter's calzone was bigger than her head, and she went silent as she enjoyed her calzone.
And? Yes - both my daughter and I both learned to love our food adversaries- eggplant has found a place in my heart, and my daughter will let blue cheese into her diet.
Definitely a must. And definitely a WOW!"}
{"text":"We ate here our first night in Montreal. Our waiter was very helpful and the food was good (although my husband's Caesar salad had too much dressing). I only gave it 3 stars because I feel the the price was a little high for what we got."}
{"text":"tasty pizza and relatively fast delivery. 4 stars and not 5 because of the girl that answered the phone and took the wrong phone number and address which had us waiting for over an hour for two pizzas but when we called back the manager was very helpful and took the right info, remade the pizzas and delivered them in a timely manner. And no, there were no discounts or anything given for the mishap, but the awesome pizza makes up for it!! :)"}
{"text":"Délicieuses pizza et Calzone cuit au four à bois. Très achalandé, prix raisonnable. Je ne suis pas très pizza mais quand j'en ai envie, ça a intérêt à être délicieux et c'est le meilleur endroit pour ça."}
{"text":"The three of us went there on a Friday night at 7:00.  It was pretty crowded but we got a seat right away.  The tables are very close together and it is noisy and hot.  We ordered two pizzas and a Caesar salad and it was enough for three gals.  There were flies and at least one bee buzzing around due to the open window.  The bathroom was sketchy but service was good as was the food.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered the Marguerita and Arugula.  The pizza sizes are personal (which I didn't know it would be but I didn't particularly research it so...).  But they were delicious and well-made.  The dough was lightly fire-roasted.  The balsamic on the Arugula was very tasty.  They are very generous on the cheese.

What made it delightful was the speedy delivery... like 10 min. and we are near palais de congres.  And Peter, the pizza guy was the nicest pizza guy I have ever met.  (In the US, you can be assured that pizza delivery is the lowest paying job out there, and it's done by ppl who suffer from gawd-knows-what-baggage that they bring to the job.... and it's usually an unpleasant experience).  Could it be that pizza delivery is a living wage here?  Or maybe they sent out creme de la crème due to an earlier bad review.  Either way, to send out a real sweetheart like that was a delight.  

Thank you!  The husband and kids are now happy and fed, and it was a great and delicious experience."}
{"text":"Good service, very good pizza with over 50 different choices baked in a brick oven. Love this place, so close to Le square Phillips hotel. Perfect.  The two of us shared a salad which came with a slice of focaccia bread for each of us. The salad was really fresh with a very nice light dressing."}
{"text":"Always a favorite and consistent. Easy with friends and kids. It gets very busy at lunch but good turnover so be patient if you need to wait.  Service can be spotty."}
{"text":"The pizzawas great a little soggy perhaps but otherwise delicious. The restaurant and its service was friendly and warming. The only complaint where is the AC in mid summer? Either way I am coming back for more."}
{"text":"First thing that truly stuck out to me was the service! Our waiter was incredibly attentive and kind to us. We went for the first time Saturday, then again Sunday and we had the same waiter during both visits. Now for the pizza, YUM! They have so many options and you can customize them however you would like. I enjoyed the classic margherita, while my boyfriend tried their seafood pizza. I took a bite and couldn't believe how delicious his was. The pizza crust was my favorite, so good! I will absolutely return when I go back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"There are 77 pizza tastes!!! Actually, one of the best pizzas in the city. Prices on wine are very affordable - the cheapest in Montreal for a bottle. Personnel is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Le lieu parfait pour un petit verre et une bonne pizza avec une amie! J'ai aimé la pizza au prociutto. La pâte est plus épaisse que les pizzas que je prends d'habitude mais elle n'est pas trop dure. Cette pizza fond littéralement dans la bouche, alors accompagnée d'un verre de vin blanc à l'italienne. Cela se déguste tout seul. Je trouve que cette pizzéria est aussi super bien située juste à côté du square philipps donc très facile d'accès."}
{"text":"Folks, save your hard earned cash.  If you're looking for an American style pizza with lots of noise and no substance then you'll love it.  However, refined, delicious good quality this is not.  Montreal has great pizzerias, why go here?  Had the arugula pizza and my date had the rapini and sausage pizza. Horrendous stuff.  Way too much cheese, the rapini tasted old, the arugula was topped with too much over powering cheap balsamic vinegar and with the too much low end cheese it was just not good.  The sausage was also low end."}
{"text":"La pizza est délicieuse, surtout avec la petite huile épicée. Les midis de semaine c'est très rempli, il faut réserver ou ne pas arriver trop tard"}
{"text":"bonne pizza. Il y a environ 75 pizzas. Il y a peut-être trop d'ingrédients sur une pizza, ce qui fait que j'hésitais entre 3 et 4 étoiles, mais bonnes pizzas au four. Sangria en format généreux. Petite terrasse sympathique.

Service rapide et courtois.

Bon repas abordable au centre ville. Ils font aussi de la livraison.

Je mange beaucoup de pizzas et préfère les pizzas napolitaines qui sont un peu moins garnis en fromages. 

Je ne crois pas que c'est la meilleure à Montréal, mais c'est un choix où on ne se trompe pas. Toujours bien rempli de gens."}
{"text":"What a disaster. We ordered two Margherita pizzas to go, paid, and were told it would take 15 minutes. We waited outside the restaurant for more than 15 minutes. Each time we stepped inside to check on our order, we were dismissed with the simple message, \"not yet.\" Finally, after waiting 30 minutes (twice as long as quoted), we asked for our money back, at which time they told us (with attitude) that our two pizzas had just gone into the oven. 

We finally received our two pizzas, which were disappointing. The pizza base was soggy, there was too much cheese, there wasn't enough sauce, and $15 is too much for a 10-inch Margherita pizza with this kind of service. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

Customer service was bad and the pizza was sad. I don't have any plans to return."}
{"text":"Finally found a pizza place in Montreal that I love. Wood oven baked Italian pizzas with good combination of ingredients. Great flavours. Noisy and casual ambience which is a positive thing for me but might be annoying to some.

I had a Italian Hawaiian pizza (#35) which was blue cheese and pineapple and God was it amazing. Can't remember the last time I had a pizza so good.

Also tried the seafood pizza (#20), crust was delicious and so was the topping. Shrimp and calamari was fresh.

They have 75 pizza options so choosing the right kind of pizza can make this a good or bad experience. My friends took eggplant one which didn't work out.  I'd suggest sticking to simple ingredients. The only downside was that they had only six olive oil and chilli flakes bottle so we had to share with other tables. Six is too less for a restaurant that can easily host 150 people at the same time. The place was packed so the servers were also rushing us. Other than that, great pizzas and I can't wait to come back again (hopefully during a less busy time)"}
{"text":"J'adoreee leur menu ! J'y suis allé quelques fois avec ma mère, une amie et mon copain, ils ont tous adoré ! Pour ma part, je prend souvent la pizza épicée avec les olives noires, quel délice ! Je recommande à tout le monde ! L'été avec la terrasse c'est encore mieux. Par contre, préparez-vous à faire la file toutes les saisons, il y a toujours beaucoup de monde ! Le service est agréable !"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and decided to order in food to our hotel and found the selection and combinations for the pizzas to be very impressive.   We ordered #24 and #60 along with S1 Salad.   The order arrived promptly (approx 40 min) to our hotel door.  First thing I noticed was that the pizza was still hot.  We opened up the lids of the pizza and were very very impressed.   The ingredients were all so fresh and the cheese was incredible.   The salad was perfectly dressed and lettuce crispy and fresh.   All of the vegetables were crisp and snappy.   The bread which accompanied the salad was so soft, so simple and so tasty.  

Overall the experience was 10/10."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the #32 Danisi .
Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, capicollo, basil, oregano, parmigiano-reggiano, 
It was very good. Nice flat pizza that was delicious and everything was fresh. Delicious tasting sauce served on the side was jalapeño oil and red pepper flakes.
The garage style window was open and let fresh air in. Plenty of choices of drinks. They serve water with your meal. Waiter was friendly and pleasant! Merci!"}
{"text":"C'est un des meilleurs endroit pour manger une excellent pizza cuite sur le charbon de bois. Plus de 70 variétés de pizza sur le menu et quelques Calzoni (de l'autre côté du menu!). 

Très bonne croute et les aliments sembles très frais.

Si vous voulez essayer autre chose que les pizzerias comerciales comme Donnini etc.. Essayer ce resto ! J'ai commandé la pizza #21 avec brocolli et olives et c'était excellent ! Ça va vous coutez environ 15$ par pizza.

L'endroit est cependant très petit et attendez-vous à un restaurant très simple.


English : One of the best Pizzeria in Montreal with pizza cooked on charcoal. More than 70 choices of pizza and a few calzoni(on the other side of the menu !).
Very good crust and the food seems very fresh (have to check that freshness in winter!) .

If you want to try something else than Donnini etc... 

It's the best place to eat a very good pizza cooked on charcoal in Montreal. I ate the #21 with broccoli and olives and it was delicious ! It cost around 15$ per pizza.

The place is small and very simple so don't ask for a fancy pizzeria.

I come back to this restaurant and it was a good as it's really a must in Montreal and my girlfriend tried the calzoni and it was excellent  !"}
{"text":"Best Fresh pizza ever, Italian map dew in colorful chalk reflects Mediterranean origin. Nice place to visit after shopping ."}
{"text":"I feel that one of the most important factors in an Italian-style pizza is getting the thin crust absolutely right, and this place doesn't quite do that.  There were certain parts of the pizza where it felt a bit too thick.  The pizza toppings themselves were quite good though and the service was reasonable (we went during crowded lunch hour).   
Also, the menu is unnecessarily intimidating, with over 70 pizza choices (and yet, no prosciutto and arugula).  Could have been made simpler with just a few base choices and allowing substitutions."}
{"text":"Some of the best food we had in Montreal, and we tried a whole slew of places for our week visiting the town. Everyone loved their pizzas. The volcano calzones were outrageous, both in flavor and size. The only reason I can't give it five stars is that the crust was a bit too thin in the middle for my taste. I had to eat portions of the pizza with a fork; it's personal preference, but I like my crust to be crispy/thick enough to support the ingredients on top of it."}
{"text":"they got sooooo many options for pizza. I asked the server for popular pizzas. great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place in Montreal. I had the seafood pizza which tasted great"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Montreal. Excellent salad, excellent focaccia. The momma (meatball) and Philip square pizzas are favourites but any are good. Service is warm and friendly and ambiance is nice and clean. All in all, must visit in town."}
{"text":"I know this is quite a common thing to say but: I love pizza. So much so that If I to build a bunker for the impending Oops-We-Ran-Out-Of-Space-Mayan-Calendar-Apocalypse it would definitely have a pizza oven in it. Maybe two.

So how does Il Focolaio fare against its competitors in Montreal? I'd have to say it more than holds its own. It's hard to say it's the very best because I haven't tried them all, but it is definitely in the top 3.

What I like about the pizza they serve is that it's not pretentious. It's not overpriced. It's a good pie with a good amount of food to stuff in your mouth. It's fresh. The dough is not too thick, not too thin and it's not mushy. These are important points some of the \"famous\" pizza joints fail on to some degree. Here you'll get your money's worth and I appreciate it when a restaurant doesn't pretend to be what it's not.

Variety is the spice of life and in this case, they brought the whole rack to their menu. If you don't find at least 3 different pizzas I would be surprised. As a vegetarian I found plenty of delicious looking options but I finally settled on La Bomba. Partly because of the name but mostly because of the chilli peppers. (It wasn't spicy enough anyway but you can never forget chilli oil on your pizza!)

Service was adequate. The place was jam packed and we never felt like anything was missing or not on time.

Ambiance is just like the pie and the front of their restaurant: it is what it is. Simple, honest, friendly, warm. There were lots of families eating with their kids. I like that. At some high-end pizza places I always feel like some of the spirit of grubbing out is lost amongst the sea of jackets, hugo boss shoes and pizzas with 2 little pieces of cheese on it for $20. Not here. Just come with a good appetite and enjoy some really good pizza.

Vegetarian food: 4.5 out of 5
Service: 4.5 out of 5
Value: 4.25 out of 5"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city for pizza! There are a lot of different types of pizza to choose from and its almost a guarantee that it will be delicious.
If you are planning on going for dinner, come before 5 otherwise it might be packed or a wait!"}
{"text":"Good crowd and this says something about the food...highly enjoyable.  The pizza menu is immense but sorted in a way that makes it easy to find just the pizza you have been craving.  Staff was attentive and nice.  Pizza was tasty but as others have said, each pizza is really for one adult.  Veggies were cut really thin and this really was very enjoyable on the pizza."}
{"text":"I fancy my self as a good judge of foods. This place did not disappoint. Excellent Neapolitan thin crust pizza with so many choices that ordering is the can test the indecisive"}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice location downtown, certainly worthy of the high reviews received. We were a party of 7 that they easily accommodated. Service was prompt and very friendly, pizzas were very tasty and didn't even take that long to come out. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times. The pizza is always good, and the service is pleasant and fast; the restaurant also has a patio open in the summertime. Montreal isn't renowned for its pizza---you won't find anything here that will rival Lombardi's in NYC, but Il Focolaio's pizza is fresh and the crust comes crisp and nicely charred. The meatball pizza is excellent, as is the pepperoni mushroom (not a combo I usually go for, but it's so good here). They don't overdo it on the toppings, which I like. In addition, their salads are simple, tasty and fresh (and big enough to share). The restaurant also delivers, and the pizza always arrives piping hot (sometimes, the delivery guy is an adorable, charming old man on a scooter. Total bonus)."}
{"text":"Great place to gather with friends -- inside or outside -- for authentic wood oven pizza.

Select from 70+ kinds of pizza or select your own toppings, for your very own personal pizza.

Made fresh with quality ingredients at a price that doesn't break the bank. 

My personal favourite is #69, the \"Lumache\" w/ sauce, escargot, garlic, mozzarella, parmesan


Hands down the best pizza in Montréal!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Portion size was perfect. I got the anchovie pizza tasted very good. My only complaint is there was a little too much toppings on the pizza. Would have been 5 stars if they weren't so heavy handed with the toppings"}
{"text":"A bit overrated I find this place. The pizza is good, but not great. There was a lot of dough and the toppings. I prefer something that is less dough-y. The toppings and service was great though."}
{"text":"LA pizza de Montreal, petit resto ou manger de superbe pizza au feu du bois bien arrosée avec un pichet de rousse

Une carte avec plus de 50 pizza a choisir, la mienne un veggie avec courgette, champignones, tomate et oignons mmmmmm trop bonne!! et avec un prix plus que raisonnable"}
{"text":"Love love love. Their pizza is amazing, they deliver fast, theres a deal that if you order 3 pizzas, the 4th is free! Additionally, their lactose-free cheese & gluten-free crust tastes the exact same as a regular would. Their sangria + patio is definitely a must as well!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in Montreal. Done to perfection everyone. and they do a killer Italian salad with just a bit of everything. This our go to place for amazing pizza when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Je sais pas si je n'ai pas eu de chance cette fois -ci mais ma pizza était pas mal brûlée en dessous! Les ingrédients étaient frais et bons...mais malheureusement ce goût de sûr-cuisson était vraiment trop présent! 
Sinon, vous trouverez un très large choix de pizzas, ainsi que la possibilité d'ajouter en plus des ingrédients!
Je tiens à mettre en avant l'exceptionnelle gentillesse des serveurs qui sont vraiment très prévenants et aux petits soins avec leur client!
Le restaurant est toujours bondé, mais ca paraît normal vu sa localisation très centrale!"}
{"text":"Yes. Cheesy delicious thin crust pizza. All I need in this life of sin is cheesy pizza. I went simple and got the margherita, which was oh so good. Ya can't go wrong with margherita ever but they do have a very extensive menu. They were packed on a Monday night around 9pm but didn't have to wait more than 5mins for a table outside. Hit the spot after hours of walking around the city. Lovely ambiance (outside) + delicious pizzas. Do it."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and great choices.  Reasonable prices.  Italian salad was very good also."}
{"text":"Don't understand why the reviews are so good. This place isn't good at all. Brigade is better (but still not that great). Perhaps I have picky taste when it comes to pizza, or the pizza in Montreal is very mediocre. But I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. It's overcrowded and not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Very tasty meal, excellent reception and service. So may choices you will find something for everyone, from simple to complex tastes. Cannot wait to go back and sit on the terrace. Thank you, it was a special dinner with my out of town guests. 

In the past we also tried take out and it's worth the trip downtown."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with wood-fired pizza overlooking Square Philips. 

Get ready to be right next to your new best friends at this delicious pizza restaurant.  The tables are packed in right but don't let that deter you from eating here.  If there happens to be a line (and there should be, it's fabulous), the pizza comes fast and you will be seated quickly.  We had great service and great pizza. Menu is in French but you can figure it out easily.  I did find there to be more cheese than I had expected for a truly Italian type pizza but it was still a very good pizza. Kids will love it!

Delicious pizza in a great location with attentive service."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay, I personally don't think it's as good as people make it out to be.
It's wood oven, so yes that's usually a great start, I just find its a little bland. Don't really taste the sauce and the cheese is nothing special. The pizza dough is rather sweet. The toppings are fresh for sure because they have a big turnover. 
I would suggest going somewhere else for a wood oven pizza, but this spot is decent if you're in the area. Nice patio"}
{"text":"Il Focolaio is a personal favourite of mine; if you're looking for the perfect thin crusted wood-burning oven pizza with fresh ingredients in a rustic-vibe restaurant, look no further! 

Too soggy, burnt, too thick, too thin--the crust of the pizza is often overlooked. Not here. Il Focolaio has nailed their crusts.

I absolutely love their \"Volcano\" calzone, and it keeps me coming back time and time again. As much as I want to explore their other options, it's VERY DIFFICULT to resist the Volcano. They offer impressive menu of pizzas, so there is surely something for everyone. They have vegetarian options, if that's something you're interested in.

The service has always been stellar; the staff is fast and attentive, and has never missed the opportunity to fill our glasses. 

Pro Tip: If you're looking to get your coffee fix in the form of a delicious, sweet ice cream dessert, you should get their Il Focolaio Dessert. It is Tartufo with a shot of their espresso blend, topped with whipped cream and chocolate powder. TO DIE FOR.

My only concern is that some of the tables are very close together, so it might get cramped during busy service. Take this with a dash of chocolate powder, because I've never personally experienced any such problems.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"There's a pizza they have with shrimp (Gambaretti).  You have to get it.  It's so good that it is making me salivate as I type, and I don't normally feel that strongly about pizza.  

We knew there was something about Il Focolaio Pizza Resto when we drove by and saw that it was one of 5-6 restaurants in the area that were absolutely packed full of people.  When we get curious, we simply have to see for ourselves.  I'm so glad for this curiosity because my girls and I were blessed with a most wonderful meal.  Every single table was packed over there, everyone was deep in conversation with someone else from their table and everyone was smiling as they took each additional bite of pizza.  

One of the best things - they accept US cash!  Although it seems to me their preference is still Canadian currency.  We saw our server hesitate when we asked him, but they still accepted when we paid the bill."}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome pizzas and great selection. Always crowded but never disappoints."}
{"text":"My fave pizza place! The wood burning oven makes all the difference and when you can order your pizza 75 different ways, there were combinations I'd never even thought of! The service is great and the food came out quickly even though the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"Worst pizza.  Not only is there an abundance of selections where you wind up not even knowing where to begin to choose from, their pizza gave me the runs.  Not pleasant.  Not pleasant at all.

The pizza itself was just alright anyways.  The best thing is probably that the place is big and can accommodate large groups.  The price is about less than $15 per person so your average fair on lunch."}
{"text":"Location: Square Phillips, not far from The Bay

Pizza: Amazing! Wood oven, thin crust, and about 30 different varieties to choose from. You seriously can't go wrong no matter which option you choose at this place. They only have one size (small) so if you go in with half an appetite then you're definitely taking half your pizza home with you. Their version of 'small' is actually pretty big - for me, anyway. 

Space: Pretty cramped and you'll almost definitely have your neighbors inspecting your order, and in some cases, strike up random conversations with you. If you're feeling antisocial, you might want to go elsewhere. 

Service: Leaves to be desired. Every time I go, I end up in the same section, with the same waiter who always looks like someone just killed his dog. The staff is not overly friendly and service is very, very slow. You can easily wait 30+ minutes to get your order so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. True, I always go at lunch when it's packed, but in my opinion, they should staff the place accordingly to speed things up. It's a popular place so they know lunch packs it in. 

They have a small terrace out front but you better get there early if you want to sit outside."}
{"text":"Somehow I always come here rather late in the evening - after a movie or sth, and it's usually still quite busy. The menu is overwhelming but seems any randomly pick is a good one. What I particularly like is that there are pretty distinct differences across the options so if you are a group and ordered a few different options you get to enjoy the variety. The highlights that I remembered: #66 smoked salmon, #20 shrimp, and sangria."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. It gets the 5 stars because it isn't pretentious. I love the #58 Kalena - artichoke and spicy pancetta. The blue cheese and pineapple is pretty awesome as well, if you like that kind of thing. I've been going here for years and the quality has always been top notch. Service is always good as well. They have a outdoor patio on the street in the summer which can be nice."}
{"text":"I have been to Montreal at least eight times and have never eaten at this jewel  It is close to Le Phillips Square Hotel.  The food was amazing , the staff was wonderful, and the atmosphere was relaxed.

I was getting homesick for good Italian food so I stopped in for dinner.  Love, Love, Love this place.  I no longer felt homesick.  There are so many different types of pizzas to choose from. The food is prepared fresh and smells delicious.  I ordered a spinach and artichoke calzone.  Sooooo good, I'm going back tonight."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the pepperoni pizza, Caesar salad and tiramisu.  Everything was wonderful.

Go early as it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Loved it and will definitely come back! We ordered the margherita and added our own toppings. Friendly service and cute place for couples and families. The pizza was great and crispy and fresh. Definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Came here to get some really good pizza and to get away from the cold! Haha. Had 2 glasses of wine, shared a #60 with a salad and it was plenty of food for 2. This is a must in Montréal. They have 75 pizzas to choose from."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Lunchtime will have a huge lineup.
Don't get lost in the menu, don't go crazy thinking some random combo of vegetables and meats will be good in pizza for some reason. Pick a simple pizza that makes sense and it will be a friggin good pizza."}
{"text":"Very busy place if you go at the wrong time, very noisy and crowded but MANY options for pizza. I love the thin crust done in the wood burning stove and this was delicious. A little pricey, and we ended up ordering \"to go\" because it was pretty packed in the small restaurant. The waiter was very nice but he said our food would be 15 min and ended up being more like 25 min. Next time I'd probably phone ahead and pick up later."}
{"text":"Loved it.
Ambience: Trattoria style dining with seating inside and on the street. Very busy and somewhat noisy but when any place is that packed what can you expect?
Service: Very friendly and helpful - even more so when you consider how busy it was. Wait staff were just as happy to speak French or English and were not in the least judgmental about their customer's language of choice (which is fairly rare in Montreal).
Food: Wonderful Neapolitan style pizza. Very \"Italian\" but seemed to have made something of a convert in a born-and-raised New Yorker in our group. Fresh ingredients and pretty much if you can conceive of it, you can have it.
Price: Pretty much about right.
I may go back before I leave here..."}

Service: 2/5 je ne peux vanter les serveurs pour leur sourire ni pour leur entregent. Le service est minimal!

{"text":"Service et aliments de qualités. Par contre, ils vont trop vite et les pizza ne sont pas cuites (moi vraiment froide et celle de ma copine a peine tiède). Lorsque j'ai retourné ma pizza en cuisine, elle est revenu brûlée. De plus, mon verre d'eau n'était pas propre et pour le prix $$$ je m'attendais à mieux."}
{"text":"Conveniently in the heart of downtown, I decided to try this pizza place out.

At first glace of the menu, there were over 50 different pizza options, including vegetarian. I had the Four Cheese pizza which was topped with mozzarella, parmesan, swiss and blue cheese. The blue cheese was a fantastic touch and was just the right amount. However it was too salty near the center of the pizza. Perhaps too much parmesan or something. Other than that, it was pretty tasty pizza!

The service was extremely friendly and fast upon request. However there were a few flaws. When I asked for my pizza to go, it was packed for me in a box but no bag. I had to ask for one. When I ordered a Bloody Caesar, my straw was 3/4 the size of the cup so I had to dig my fingers in and look for the straw every time I wanted a sip. 

Overall, a pretty good first experience. Would probably revisit and try other toppings!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and nice place! I was delighted with the smoked meat pizza they have an amazing selection for all tastes. That being said I would not claim it is the best pizza I ever had."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest but the best pizza I have had in Mtl. Simply the best. Been here twice with a group of friends - the ambiance is good, and it's not too loud for conversation. Huge selection of pizzas, with a large variety for both meat lovers, pescaterians,  and vegetarians.  Their system to mark this on the menu is helpful (but there may be a few too many categories?).
Definitely a place to go back to!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a wooden fire pizza in the city. The menu is very (so) vast that it takes a while to make a choice, but really you can barely go wrong with your choice here! One negative point is the wait to get our order (30 mns) but it might have been an exception, not sure."}
{"text":"We came here and had lunch after shopping on Saturday. There was crowded. We ordered the S3 super huge and strong flavor salad and the No.27 pizza topped with ham , sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, a ton of cheese and took a hearty meal. It's my first time to eat artichoke hearts. Pretty refreshing."}
{"text":"I remember walking past by this place once during lunch time and saw this place jam packed. That obviously stirred up my curiosity and I eventually found out the name of this place through Google Maps (Thank you street view)! 

I had a hard time deciding where to sit because the view of Phillips Square is actually pretty darn sweet during the time of sunset. I ended up sitting by the window near the patio. 

I ordered a Pizza Pazza and my friend got a prosciutto pizza of some sort. We had a pretty good time devouring those pizzas. 

One thing to note was that our waiter was super nice. He came over to warn me that the ink on the menu (printed on newsprint) might smudge off and get onto our clothes (I was wearing white). That was the sweetest thing ever."}
{"text":"Had pizza here 5 years ago and I've been dreaming about it ever since, it was like being back in Italy with their delicious wood fire oven pizza; unfortunately this time around the pizza was tasteless as if they didn't cook it enough in the wood fire oven for it to get a good crunchy crust and delicious taste. Plus, I had the misfortune of finding an elastic in my pizza. Yes an actual elastic. The sever was very nice and offered another one, but I won't be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. There were line on Friday night. Staff is really Friend. We were looking for a place to eat and we saw a lot of people waiting and gave it a try. Glad we did."}
{"text":"This is a tourist trap.  Do not eat here. Both meals that we ordered were absolutely disgusting.  The calzone was totally undercooked.  I honestly don't know how they have so many high review scores but trust me when I say that the food here is awful."}
{"text":"Firstly, go early cause this place gets packed. The choices are unlimited for pizza...pick one \"by number\"...or add/subtract. large one -size fits all ($13-16 range).
good wine list, 3/4 draft beers, several bottle beer.
Pizza is wood fired and delicious and if you sit where you can see where they are prepared, the efficiency is amazing, how they can serve so many people so quickly. Servers were also very good. Definitely would go back....great place. happy trails"}
{"text":"If you want to know what pizza taste like in Italy then this is your place! The place is super casual & busy! I wanted to sit on the patio but Montreal still allows smokers to smoke on the patios- I'm allergic so we dined inside-I could still smell the smoke because the \"garage window\" was open. So I ordered a bottle of wine (going to get a headache my way). Waiter we had was friendly, service was great! We ordered 2 pizzas & a full salad. We had #28 - basic pepperoni pizza $14.25 & #? It had black olives, artichokes,ham and #s1 salad. All EXCELLENT! I almost felt like I was in the Mediterranean. The pizza dough is a delisioso thin crust with hint of salt & flavour.  I'm going to go back before I leave Montreal and gain a few more worth it pounds. They offer takeout as well."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Patio was a little overfilled, but service was quick and attentive. I would return."}
{"text":"Maybe its just that I'm from New York, but I was complete unimpressed! 

This place has a huge menu of pizza options which was a great appeal. I ordered the Renaissance: Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, olives, mozzarella, spicy pancetta. With all of those toppings I expected deliciousness, but it was completely devoid of all flavor. The pizza size is a little more than what one person can eat in a sitting, so I had some leftover, but for once in my life, declined to take it home.

Husband kept things simple with the Peperonata: Sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella. The pepperoni had been placed between the sauce and cheese leaving it soggy and unappetizing. He also declined to take home his leftovers.

All in all, if you are in Montreal and craving pizza, just say no. There are so many delicious things to be eaten in this city. Do not waste your $$ or the room in your tummy!"}
{"text":"I've bee countless times. Great every time. The calzones are terrific as well. Just flip the placemat over."}
{"text":"Pretty good oven fired pizza. They have a vast selection but you can narrow down a choice by looking at their categories on the menu placemat. It's a bit crowded in the winter with the large coats hanging off the chairs but I can imagine that it's pretty sweet spot to eat and it's got almost the touristy feel of an Italian ristorante in the summer. I ate half of my pizza and it was pretty good the next day toasted up."}
{"text":"First off, there are so many choices to chose from and the most important point is that they all look good!! The pizza is really filling (i was full after 3 slices). The staffs are friendly, and the decor is nice. I'll have to say that it is kinda expensive (compared to those 3$ pizza slices in food courts) but of course the quality is great. The pizza tasted good but didn't amaze me, but I'll still come back and taste more pizza from their menu. Anyways, never thought pizza could be this fancy (people were eating it with forks and knives lol)"}
{"text":"#74 is one of the best pizza's I've had in Montreal. Truffles mixed with anchovies (for salt - you don't taste fish) garlic, parsley, wine & corn oil. Cherry tomatoes, oregano, basil, olive oil, mozzarella and goat cheese. Top it with some spicy oil and you're in heaven.  The cannoli is nothing special. Lacks depth.  Top 5 pizza places in the city."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go to Italy to sample a pizza, and if it's half as good there as it is at Il Focolaio then I need to book a ticket asap. Actually, scratch that I'll just keep coming to Montreal.

The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and the staff are helpful and friendly. I was seated immediately and served really fast.

I ordered the Hawaiian pizza which comes loaded with ham and black olives as well, of course, as a generous helping of pineapple. The pizza was cooked to absolute perfection and I was more than impressed. 

I opted for a cappuccino after dinner (which tasted fantastic) instead of dessert but was definitely tempted by the fare on offer. 

If you are in the area you definitely need to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Marguerita and Italiano salad brought to the table already split for us! Delish and waiter was very friendly. Had to sit inside due to rain but sat at a table at edge of the inside patio. No wait to be seated and super quick service."}
{"text":"I went today with my family and took #23&27 as meat pizza and two more pizza  one with cheese and the other with sea food... Overall the pizza and the service  are amazing.. really great place and food .. totally recommended"}
{"text":"I noticed this place after walking by it on the way to old montreal, and decided to stop back the next day. While it was a little pricy, the service was incredible, and the food came in HUGE portions. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, and my girlfriend ordered a meatball parm, which was gigantic. 

We got lucky in that the restaurant was dead when we stopped in, but regardless got great service from the waitress."}
{"text":"Had a great experience ordering delivery from here. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 pizzas with an estimated delivery time of 45 min, but ended up only taking around 25 on a Saturday night which was great. The pizza was delicious as well. There are so many different options, it's hard to make a choice!"}
{"text":"This is officially the best wood fire pizza I've ever had in Montreal. Love the atmosphere and the service is quick and efficient. I had the margarita pizza and it was the best! This is my favourite new pizza place in Montreal."}
{"text":"Never thought I would enjoy a pizza place so much but this is by far the BEST PIZZA I've had. The place is crowed and It had that elbow to elbow feeling that I didn't enjoy but it is worth coming back. My husband had a Pizza with ingredients that I didn't like and when he gave me a bite of his pizza I was surprise because it tasted great anyway. Would recommend to anyone. The price is fair for what you get. A must try!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Loved it. 70 choices. I'm a Montrealer. Can't believe I never heard of this amazing place. Will definitely be going back ."}
{"text":"I am not a pizza connoisseur but I know what is good. Very delicious! The crust is perfectly crisp and chewy along with that wood fire taste.  Plus, the place was bursting at the seams. Tells you everything you want to know."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza place! Been there several times and the pizza is great each time. Should probably go back soon to try a new selection on the very long and detailed pizza menu! Great location too and homey atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Husband picked us up pizza from here a few days ago and it was pretty good. 
He got Pollo Nostro #65. It had tomatoes, pesto, hot peppers, grilled chicken and mozzarella. 
The crust was thicker then I expected it to be but it tasted good regardless. It's cooked in a wood oven so has a delicious smoky scent. 
I have had pizza in Naples, Italy where it was originated and this tasted extremely legit. Excited to try more of their 75 different kinds of pizza toppings."}
{"text":"Il Focolaio is one of the best thing about living in Montreal. 

And, the desserts are absolutely fantastic. 

I love you, Il Focolaio. I wish you were my lover. 

We'd do everything together, but I'm afraid I couldn't help myself and I'd eventually eat you."}
{"text":"Great pizza and surprisingly fast service. The pizzas came within 10 min of ordering."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great family run spot (and location). 

We ordered a Margherita pie to go. It was made fast, exceedingly fresh, and it tasted absolutely delish!!! 

Crazy thing is, we're from NY where they're known for pizza, and this place exceeded our expectations. Definitely a must if you're craving good quality and yummmmmmy pizza. 

Next time, we will eat-in and try some more exotic flavored pizzas. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was in Italy last month and this pizza was pretty much just as great. The crust is really the most important part, not too thick, not too burnt, not too soggy. I was skeptical when a fork and knife were offered to eat pizza with, and I was the only one in the party that insisted to pick my slices up. Their menu is extremely expansive, where you can end up with TONS of toppings on your pizza. It's great, but the only setback is you might have trouble keeping the toppings on when you pick up the slices. I got la Milanese pizza, and I saw how they put the driest topping (Italian ham) on the bottom, so the crust wouldn't get too wet. There were some previous reviews about too little tomato sauce but you honestly don't need too much! 

Our party also ordered meatballs, a dessert calzoni, and pitchers of sangria to share. All the food there is reasonably priced in terms of Montréal restaurant standards. The dessert calzone was also amazing, thin dough filled with Nutella and what I think was canolli filling. Definitely share it with at least 5 people! 

We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed! I think you need to get a reservation whenever you want to go because this place is always filled. 
The atmosphere was welcoming, but loud and hot. I couldn't hear what the people on the other side of the table were saying. I was sweating a lot at the table near the oven. 
Anyways, worth going if you like a classic Italian pizza. The pizza gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love love love!!!!!! Best pizza in town and I love how they have options for everybody! (Lactose intolerant, vegetarians etc)"}
{"text":"Cesar salad for the table was excellent! A ton of options for personal pizzas ( which are actually really really big, def for 2 people) and alot of calzones options! Very flavorful and authentic. Would recommend for Italian food options. Casual vibes, 15$ and up for each item. Good service! Wish it was less pricy, didnt love our calzone."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. The terrace was pretty packed but we managed to get a table immediately. I had the worst seat of all: right next to the entrance. The terrace was also quite loud, but not intolerable.  

Il Focolaio has a large variety of pizzas. Also, the fuss about this place is the crust, which is oven-cooked. I chose the St-Denis: sausages, capicollo, mushrooms, mozzarella and I replaced the green bell peppers with onions. 

I don't think I ever got my food in a restaurant so quickly. I think we waited for about 15 minutes and yet the place was full. That was impressive. 

The pizza was a reasonable size (more or less 12 inches). The crust was really good. When you go, ask for the pepper and the spicy oil. It really adds a little something to your pizza. Otherwise, my pizza tasted a little bland.  

The prices are reasonable. They go from $11 to $15. 

Conclusion: If you want a good pizza that isn't worth $1 per slice, this is a good option. But I wouldn't say this is THE best pizzeria in Montreal."}
{"text":"So, being from Connecticut and the home of New Haven-style pizza, I have high expectations for a pizza place.

This places comes closer than a bunch. The amount of pizza combos is terrific, if a little overwhelming. But with an English menu, the servers were friendly and efficient.

Indeed, our pizzas came out super quick! 

We tried one with prosciuto and another one with zucchini. Both were much more filling than you would think. Two pizzas is probably enough for three people to share as a guide. 

As you might expect from a pizza cooked quickly, the middles of the pizza were a little sloppy and cheese tends to congregate there in a bit of a goopy mess. The sauce was fine but I did enjoy the crust.

Overall, it was a great little stop right near our hotel and all in need for some good pizza.  Not touristy at all. 

Just don't compare it to the pizza we have back home.  Because it's not as good. :)"}
{"text":"Great traditional Italian pizzeria. The food was delicious and the service was great. You can eat inside or outside on the patio. The pizzas are the size of one dinner plate so it is a little bit pricey for the size but it is a touristy area."}
{"text":"An amazing, authentic local favourite. This was my first time here but it was highly recommended by a friend who has been dining here for years and swears by its real, Italian goodness. We ordered 4 different pizzas and they were all unique and delicious. Ingredients were very fresh and pizzas offered just the right balance of sauce and cheese and toppings. Price is very reasonable and the portions are generous... the only problem you're likely to encounter here is being overwhelmed by the 75+ options of pizzas available. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place used to be A LOT better in 2016.  Not sure if it's under different management now or what but, man has it ever gone downhill.  Went there a couple nights ago and we had to seat ourselves, the table right beside us was clearly much better taken care of.  Within 30 seconds of sitting down they had water.  Within a minute they had their wine.  Keep in mind they seated 5-10 mins AFTER us.  I'm guessing they got better service because, they were dressed nicer -  not sure...  Our server never actually introduced himself.  We had to keep calling other servers over, just to ask for drinks and to place our order!  Ridiculous!  I ordered bread with my salad, which he forgot.  The pizza itself had also gone downhill.  Way too much cheese, as soon as I picked it up it all just fell off.  Extra cheese is great but, it's easy to go overboard and they went way overboard.  Way too gooey.  The bottom of my cousin's pizza was burnt.  Service was horrible.  We weren't even offered dessert, so if the business is reading this not only did you loose a sale of the dessert but, you lost future sales.  We used to tell everyone about this place and bring people here all the time, we used to come here several times while visiting Montreal but, we will never be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Easily the best one I know downtown. The selection is humongous and a little overwhelming. But just pick one and you shouldn't be disappointed. The service could be just a little friendlier, but every time I go it's lunch time and they looked stressed trying to keep up with the crowd."}
{"text":"I had the marinara pizza and it was pretty good, they put a lot of cheese and toppings on their pizzas! We splitted the pizza between us 2 and I was full with only half of it, we even had trouble finishing it cause were both really full.
It's also really cool that they serve the pizza in two plates when you share one.
The Sangria was cheap but tasted so-so.
The staff is really efficient and polite.
I think the only negative point is that the bathrooms are dark and creepy haha
Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This may be the best pizza I've ever eaten! I ordered the Portobello pizza, which was amazing. I wish the service had been a little better (my server forgot to bring me silverware and brought me my bill without asking if I was interested in seeing a dessert menu), but I can't totally blame them since the place was packed. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for pizza in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome, but save room for the cheesecake!  The local pale draft was very good."}
{"text":"I was on the search for an authentic Italian pizza place with a terrasse. Yelp recommended this one so one sunny Friday evening, we decided to check it out!
It was completely packed so we had to line up for a few minutes but luckily got a cute little spot outside quite quickly. I loved the minimal decor and pretty lighting that created a very european feel. For a moment, it really felt as if I was dining outside in the narrow & cobbled streets of Italia!

Now on to the menu... A ginormous selection of pizzas, over 70 delicious combinations to choose from! If you are quite an indecisive person like me, then expect to take at least 10 minutes to decide what you want to order. I have never seen so many vegetarian options of pizza! At most places you only get the usual Margherita and vegetarian choice but here there was a big variety. 
I opted for #38 Ratatouille - a vegetarian pizza consisting of green peppers, eggplant, zucchini, spanish onions, garlic etc whilst my husband went for a submarine. 
The pizza was absolutely gorgeous and divine! An explosion of flavours, the vegetables just right not overdone... The pizza dough stone baked to perfection ahh! The submarine also looked delicious and unique as the pizza dough was used as the bread... Very different! My husband devoured it in a flash and then attacked my pizza! 

Looks like we will be coming here again! 
Great service, ambiance, flavours... (For that, I can ignore the lack of ketchup!) 5 big fat stars!!"}
{"text":"We ordering delivery from this place.  I would say it one of the best pizza.  This restaurant has over 70 pizzas choices.  Very fast delivery.  Very recommending.  If you like spicy make sure you pick spicy sausages."}
{"text":"Solid, non-pretentious food near downtown. Definitely among some of the best pizza we've had in a long time. The portions were right and the atmosphere was great. Our server, Vito, made The experience even more enjoyable. You got to try the Cannoli at the end of the meal.  If time would help permitted, we would have went back again (visiting from Boston, MA)."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here in the last three weeks. The first time I was drawn by the Yelp reviews and the second time I was hoping to have a repeat experience of my first visit. There are no less than 75 pizzas to choose from which could be overwhelming but the legend in the top left corner of their menu make it easy to group and narrow your choices - veg, seafood, meat and tofu pizzas are all labelled. Last time I had the pizza primavera which was excellent and this time I tried the smoked salmon with capers. I loved the primavera pizza that first time and I liked the smoked salmon this time. Needless to say on my third visit I'll have the primavera again. Although the salmon pizza was pretty good, the primavera was an absolute delight. Fresh, large (but not too large) chunks of broccoli, olives, mushrooms on a perfectly thin crust pizza, that's not so thin that you can't hold the pizza in one hand and eat it without folding it over in two. Last time I sat inside, service was incredibly fast and I had a nice Argentinian Malbec that I barely sipped before my pizza arrived. This time I sat on the patio. It was about equally busy as the last time (which is pretty busy) but service was slower. I didn't really mind as it gave me a chance to enjoy my 1/2 pitcher of sangria while people watching in the bustling St Philips Square area. I will be returning  again."}
{"text":"Il Focolaio is known as the best pizza in Montreal and I have to say I agree.
The service manages to be decent despite it usually being almost full most nights.
I had a sangria with my spinach and sausage pizza, both of which were good!
The cheese on my pizza especially was nothing like I had before; super cheesy and stringy! I'd return but not a place I'd frequent because it's pretty loud. I'd opt for delivery if you wanted a quieter night in."}
{"text":"This restaurant is over the moon wonderful. It was so busy last night that I only ordered a cannoli to go but came back today for lunch. Pizza is amazing accompanied by sangria and I topped it off with another delicious freshly piped cannoli. The service was friendly and attentive! Beautiful!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous!  Had the margherita pizza and a bit of my husband's that had a mix of veggies and meat. Both were delicious!  Caesar salad was HUGE and also had a great taste with the dressing. Outdoor seating is a perfect touch especially on a beautiful night. Only thing I took two stars away for the service. Our waiter #444 Vito was horrid!  Bad mood, not friendly, didn't clear dishes when finished, and never checked up on us. Sadly all the other waiters looked to be friendly and efficient, wish we had better luck. If you go there, ask to not have Vito or his sour expression!"}
{"text":"Ordered #68 for delivery to my hotel and they made it here quicker than expected. The pizza was great! Fresh ingredients, still hot out of the oven, and hit the spot! I recommend this place when you get a pizza craving."}
{"text":"I ordered Said , #62, it had all the ingredients I was looking for! Very, very tasty and fresh ingredients really came through. I added some of the \"spicy oil\" and it WAY better than pepper flakes generally offered with pizza. a bit noisy but gave us an opportunity to visit with our neighbors was welcomed. Friendly and efficient wait staff. Will be back !!"}
{"text":"One hundred percent would recommend. Fantastic pizza, sangria that I would sell my firstborn for, and fast and friendly service. This is a MUST when visiting Montreal. One recommendation: its busy! Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Really good Pizza place in Montreal. Pizza price around 14$ which is enough to fill someone.
Highly recommended to take clients to lunch there."}
{"text":"I went here because I've heard it was delicious. It was packed. I got the 32 (Danisi), but it was hard to choose! I really liked the base, sauce, and cheese. The sauce wasn't super acidic or anything and the cheese was generously put on and gooey. Really good. The only thing that irked me was that the capicollo wasn't really spicy (I thought it would be because I think the menu said it was, but to be far I don't have a whole lot of experience with capicollo) and seemed more like regular cooked deli ham. This was a bit of a bummer, but they were generous with the toppings. I'll still go back when I've got a hankering for pizza.  Also, huge menu too. There's something for everyone. They have specialty options for vegetarians and those who are gluten-free and so many flavor combinations.

J'ai visité Pizza Il Focolaio parce que mon amie m'a dit que c'est délicieux. Il y'a beaucoup de gens dans ce restaurant. J'ai choisi le 32 (Danisi), mais c'était difficile choisir! J'ai aimé le pain, le sauce, et le fromage. Il n y'a pas le gout d'acide dans le sauce et il y'a beaucoup de fromage sur le pizza. Le seule chose que je n'ai pas aimé était le capicollo. C'était pas épicé, et il avait le gout de jambon régulier. Il y'a beaucoup de dessus sur le pizza et beaucoup de type de pizza ( végetarian....)"}
{"text":"I read many reviews for this place and decided to check it out considering how highly praised it was. The restaurant is pretty small when you take away the patio but we didn't have a problem getting in without a reservation (it was just before 6). I got the margherita pizza and my fiancée got the romano. Both of these pizzas were AMAZING! I will definitely be visiting this place again on my next visit to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Good, not great, pizza. Excellent service. Lots of pizza choices. One is enough for two people if you are heading out to dinner later in the evening. Guys with big appetites, you will definitely want one to yourself. Probably 3 pizzas for four people is the best way to go."}
{"text":"There are many choices to choose from in this area but, this is one you should deathly try out. 

So glad that I did not see Yelp before I came here.

The muscles and fries special was excellent, service is great, prices are very reasonable, and other food quality was spot on!"}
{"text":"Euh, wow?
Une pizza au top de la pyramide de la bonne pizza?
Un service rapide et courtois?
Une grande sélection de vins provenant de toutes les régions d'Italie? 

Avec les images qui roulent en boucle sur les écrans, j'ai même réussi à m'ennuyer de mon ex, à cette époque où je faisais Montréal-Bologne aux 6 mois. Mais ça, c'est un secret, ok?

On s'en sort à bon prix... et si vous y allez à deux avec un appétit standard, vous pouvez partager une pizza sans problème: c'est immense. Quoique j'ai réussi à tout manger moi-même. MAIS C'ÉTAIT SI BON! 

Vive le four à bois, vive l'Italie, vive Il Focolaio!"}
{"text":"Place is very small. But food is excellent and cheap. They have 73 different pizzas. And I already tested 5 of them. They are DELICIOUS. I will definitely go back any day!"}
{"text":"Update: visited in July 2017. Decided to guarantee better food by advising the server about the two previous poor experiences with pizza that was cold in the middle. Pizza arrived hot all the way through, but crust too well done and very brown compared to my friend's. New gluten-free pizza dough they were trying at the time (July) results in a much smaller personal pizza than the regular dough, to the point where my friend felt bad in comparison to her larger one. Increased my review by one star, and only one because this is still a _tweaking phase_ instead of a well-tested and worthy option for gluten-free. Rather surprising that a restaurant this well-established still hasn't got this right. I could only recommend this place to people who don't need to eat gluten-free. If I ever try it again and it's still this disappointing, it's time to remove stars!


-------
Original review:

If only the pizza had not been cold in the middle on _two_ occasions (visits in September and November 2016) I would give this place 5 stars. As mentioned in every review it has an extensive and delicious menu including gluten- and lactose-free options and relatively friendly service. It's been packed each evening I've been. Sadly, the first time, all three of us had to send our pizzas back because they were cold in the middle. They were also too brown (overdone). Staff apologized and had the pizzas taken back to the kitchen, warmed some more and then brought back to us. Of course you think that for some reason that it's just a bad night. The second time was at the end of November, and 1 of the 2 pizzas was again cold in the middle and had to be sent back... but still... why is this happening at all? What is wrong with either the wood burning oven or the staffing? I am considering whether to try it again, but right now I would not feel comfortable inviting friends. What a shame."}
{"text":"This place easily makes one of the best pizzas in Montreal. They make their own pizza sauce and likely also the crust. Both were delicious. One pizza is too much for one person. My friend and I shared a pizza and a salad and were both full. Great location too. They have a patio. Reasonable prices considering they're in a touristy location just off of St. Catherine Street."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza....every combination you can imagine on the menu, plus you can add just about anything you can think of. 69 named variations!!! Pizzas are plate size, perfect for one hungry person. Go early...we had a short wait at 6 pm, but a big line at 7:30. Crowded, but very good service. Apparently a student favorite. Not a place for quiet conversations! Lively and fun! Not a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Good place. Get whole wheat crust & no cheese if you want vegan. They don't have vegan cheese, but tasty anyway. 

Italian salad was very tasty too.

House red wine also good."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with a really cool restaurant inside. A very interesting man from greece giving us life lessons as we bite in one of their 75 pizza selections. Very cool and trendy. The servers are nice and help you out to navigate through the menu. They have a small bar and some old school liquor posters from back in the days, if you're into that kinda thing. 

Must recommend if you're pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Fun pizza joint with a wood fired oven.  An extensive pizza menu means everyone should be able to find something to eat.  Included are 2 tofu options plus a whole wheat Omega 3 crust option.

The room is overall lighter in colour with Italian themed art and posters which makes it feel a bit light hearted and airy.  The garage door style front opens to let the nice weather in.

Staff are polite and focused.  It's a busy environment.

My pizza (Rennaissance) was delicious.

Would I return? Yes
Would I recommend? Yes"}
{"text":"Chose this place at random when looking for Italian food! Turned out great - very quick service! I"}
{"text":"75 pizzas to choose from it's like taking forever, any way we finally ordered. But my expectations were away higher for such a busy place with lots of positive reviews. The most important element of pizza is it's dough and their dough was doughy not crispy at all! And pizzas we ordered were heavy with oily artichokes on top. Won't try this place again"}
{"text":"Parts of dough were burnt, parts were raw, under sauced but we'll garnished pizza. Priced right and served right by efficient waiters. I will give it another try someday. 75 pizza choices can take you 15.minutes to decide. Very tight seating specially around bar, avoid that area. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Went to Il Focolaio two days back and had the best restaurant experience in Montreal. 50% of that credit goes to our beyond amazing waiter- RACHID E. and rest would be the pizza of course. 
I ordered the number 72 and my husband got the number 63, the meat and the cheese were extremely fresh. I was stuffed after my third slice but I felt not finishing would be a crime and kept going. I can't wait to visit there next. 

I highly recommend this place and also make sure you get served by Rachid, he is so joyful and made our evening special."}
{"text":"Si vous recherchez un pizzeria - ou juste un bon resto - à bon marché dans le coin du centre-ville, je vous conseille. Une place qui fait ses preuves depuis 1984, Il Focolaio offre un menu avec plus de 75 pizzas différentes! 

Il y a meilleure pizza en ville, mais jusqu'à date, j'ai apprécié chaque visite au restaurant et les repas ont été bien dégustés. Cependant, en été, je vous averti tout de suite: alerte aux abeilles en sur la terrasse et les tables sont extrêmements rapprochés! Cet été, mon amie et moi avons eu droit à une crise d'apiphobe à la table d'à côté. Pas comique. 

Mais bon, la prochaine fois que vous êtes dans le coin et que vous êtes à la recherche d'un restaurant abordable, laissez faire les \"fast foods\" et optez pour la pizzeria du Square-Phillips!"}
{"text":"They have many kinds of pizza, it is very thin and fresh, our school always chooses as first choice to order as seminar food."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I have ever had and the service was so prompt, friendly and helpful. I normally write an extensive review, but just go here. Enough said!"}
{"text":"#1: Napoletana: Sauce tomate, mozzarella, anchois, olives kalamata, câpres
SUPER salée!!! Je ne sais pas à quoi je m'attendais, considérant les olives, câpres et anchois, mais j'ai eu l'impression que c'était littéralement souproudré de sel!  

Pour la première pizza sur le menu (chut, ne dite à personne à quel point j'ai eu du mal à faire mon choix compte tenu des 75 choix et que finalement j'ai pris par défaut la numéro 1 en pensant qu'elle serait surement leur pizza signature) je m'attendais à vraiment mieux. La croûte était parfaite par contre!

#40: Al Prosciutto: Sauce tomate, prosciutto, mozzarella, champignons 
Super bonne! La croûte semblait différente, peut-être plus épaisse pour supporter la plus grosse quantité de légumes qui laisse beaucoup d'eau à la cuisson. 

Malgré leur petit coût, qui est un excellent rapport-qualité prix, ne vous laissez pas berner! Les portions sont gigantesques alors en groupe, peut-être mieux de commander plusieurs pizzas pour partager et non une chaque!

Dommage qu'il y a toujours une longue file le midi, sinon je viendrais plus souvent."}
{"text":"Man, I just love the crust of their pizzas!  If I could just eat their crust with a nice glass of wine...it would be alright by me.  ;)  But, I would love to recommend this place to anybody that loves good food that isn't overly done with spices like some pizza joints I have gone to in the U.S.  The food here is more about the natural flavors of every ingredient you may order on your pizza.

Note:  Please don't come to this place expecting the flavor of a New York or Chicago style pizzas.  They're awesome pizzas...but, this place is more of suttle flavors that need to be complimented with a bottle of wine or beer."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The pizza is amazing, especially when you drizzle their spicy oil on top. The ingredients are of top notch quality. Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting was also delicious. At first it was hard to choose a restaurant from yelp because it seems that all restaurants in the area have 4 or more stars. There was no way to distinguish restaurants from each other because they all had the same rating! I figured maybe it's because Canadians are just too nice. But growing up in Chicago and Cali, I can still vouch for this place. Try it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Small joint, but the food is well worth it. We got the margarita and the testarossa, both were unique and delicious. Negroni was great also!"}
{"text":"Great pizza spot in Montreal! 5 star pizza minus 1/2 (rounding up due to circumstances) star for logistics of our experience. 

We arrived just after it had rained, so things were a bit chaotic. The outside staff said no one was being seated there in case of future rain, but people kept being seated there. The inside person running the line didn't seem like she had a good handle on who was next (maybe she did and that was my perception.) One person (maybe just a patron) told us we needed to be in line, which didn't make any sense since we were on the list. We certainly understand the challenge of trying to find indoor spots for people who were seated in the rainy area.

We did end up outside and had a very nice experience. The pizza was very fresh - amazing crust, and we took cannolis to go - also very fresh tasting. We had pizzas 40 and 47 - which were pesto and prosciutto. Only wish is that the olives on the pesto were kalamata instead of black. However, both great pizzas. Hopefully our next visit will be sunny and beautiful!"}
{"text":"VERY impressed!  Our first night in Montreal, we decided to stick with something we knew (and not really being fans of French food) and came here, which was right in Phillips Square, and about 3 doors down from our hotel.  It had been raining, so it wasn't very crowded, but this place gets extremely crowded.

We all four ordered our own pizzas.  They had a menu in English, which we had to ask for, but thankfully had the translations for all of the items.  I had an excellent beer on tap, very cold, excellent!

The pizzas were fantastic.  All four of us had different pizzas.  Since I can't find the english menu online, I'll just say I had a pepperoni and mushroom which I found to be fantastic.  My wife had a pesto pizza, which she said was perfectly prepared.  The kids had standard cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza.   All of it was very very good.  

The kids had Tartufo, which they never had had.  This was a store bought Tartufo, but excellent nonetheless.

I have to say we were pleasantly impressed and satisfied at the end of our meal.  Service was extremely friendly, eager to please, and rapid."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic and SO delicious! And vegetarian friendly too! 

The ambience is awesome, its a great place sit outside on the patio. Although the place is really crowded, the service is excellent. The food arrives in time, and the waiters are really really friendly and accommodating. 

Try the veggie pizza with the peppers on it, that was our personal fav, we ended up ordering another one. 

If you're in the mood for real authentic pizza, the type that doesn't make you feel bad when you're done, go for it!"}
{"text":"My husband has a tendency to eat pizza in every place we visit. In Montreal, Il Focolaio was the pizza of choice. 

The patio area was lovely, though quite crowded, with folks enjoying the plentiful sunshine and breeze. We were seated promptly, and the staff was courteous and prompt.

The menu is a little intimidating, with 75 different types of pizza to choose from, but there's a code on it that allows you to focus on certains items that may be \"meaty,\" \"have lots of veggies,\" etc. This simplifies what might otherwise be a daunting task.

The Quatro Stagioni and Said were ordered, and were very much enjoyed. My one negative comment about the pizza is something I find frequently--the center of the pizza was a little soggy (but I ate the whole thing so apparently it wasn't too bad). 

I didn't eat any other pizza in Montreal, but I can't imagine it could have been much better."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've ever had but its pretty good! Nice place to get a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Nice crust. Not too thin, not heavy. A paper placemat menu with 70 pizza options (somehow this already makes me love you). All the ones I've tried are fresh and the combinations tasty. Sort of an old Italian Quebecois family diner vibe with big pitchers, dignified but not fancy. They'll treat you right and fill you up and possibly pass on some life advice with the take-out menu. Come as you are.

If the weather is fair and you sit in the patio you'll have one of the homiest views of downtown Montreal, looking out on Phillips Square, just off the press of St Catherine's. A lovely mellow old school place for pizza pie."}
{"text":"First pizza in Montreal, well recommended and no kidding good pizza with many many choices for topping combos, we even did dessert and everyone (8 people) was happy sharing.  The salad was huge, the sizes for pie are two people size, excellent  crust. Came to table very fast"}
{"text":"Meh. There's better pizza in Montreal.

I personally believe that a restaurant should specialize and be the best at just a few things. The menu at Il Focolaio is overwhelming and lists upwards of 70+ pizzas. There was no \"Wow\" factor, just OK pizza. The service was slow and forgetful, but at least it's affordable."}
{"text":"We ordered 10 pizzas from them for delivery for a group dinner.  The delivery guy was awesome, he made it a few minutes earlier than expected.  We had Carre Phillips, Messicana, Campagnola, Italian Hawaiian, Arugula, Marinara.  The Italian salads were large portions so we ordered one too many but they're a really good complement for the pizza so I'd recommend ordering it as a side.  Service over the phone was great and the food was good.  Pizza's are cut in 4 slices and either 2-3 slices per person is good enough as we still had a few slices left over.  They're individual sized pizzas but don't be fooled by their small diameter, they're quite filling because the toppings are quite rich!  Their pizzas are wood oven-cooked so some crusts are darker around the edges which some people like but others don't.  Crusts are medium-thin and has a good chew to it. We enjoyed all the flavor choices we made."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Montreal!! I went here with my friends on a Tuesday night and there wasn't too much of a crowd. The ambience is very nice and the service is great as well. My friends and I each ordered a pizza for ourselves and got a pitcher of sangria which paired very nicely with the food. For dessert we got the Nutella calzone which was as good as it sounds and made all of us sleepy and ready for a nap. I highly recommend this place for a good night out with friends or a date."}
{"text":"Mon chum avait été manger à ce resto lors d'un de ses passages à Montréal. Il tenait absolument à m'y emmener lors de notre récent sejour dans la Métropole.

Nous étions à proximité vers 11h30 pour attendre un ami. Nous avons pu constater que le restaurant se remplissait à une vitesse folle, alors nous avons été nous asseoir pour être sûrs d'avoir une table.

Et heureusement, car le restaurant etait PLEIN seulement 30 minutes après l'ouverture!

Nous avons eu du temps pour faire notre choix parmis les quelques 70 pizze proposées. Quel enfer, autant de choix possible, très dur de se decider quand on veut toutes les goûter! Nous avons finalement arrêté notre choix sur la Campagnola (#23).

Notre ami nous a rejoint et nous avons passé notre commande. 30 minutes d'attente nous a t-on dit avant d'être servis (délai très raisonnable compte tenu de l'achalandage).

Nous étions situés juste à côté du four. On voyait donc les cuisiniers s'affairer comme des fourmis pour préparer les nombreuses pizze commandées.

Notre commande est arrivée plus vite que prévu je pense car je n'ai pas vu le temps passer.

C'est à mon sens la meilleure expérience en matière de pizza depuis notre arrivée au Québec il y a plus de 7 ans. Une vraie merveille! La pâte est fine et cuite à la perfection. Les ingredients sont frais et goûteux, du bonheur à chaque bouchée!

Le service est très efficace aussi. Notre ami et nous avons commandé à quelques minutes d'intervalle mais nous avons tous les 3 été servis en même temps. On nous a débarrassé rapidement et nous avons pu régler très rapidement aussi.

Alors oui la place est très bruyante et on est un peu les uns sur les autres, mais si vous pouvez faire abstraction, vous dégusterez assurément une des meilleures pizze en ville!"}
{"text":"Still the best pizza joint in Montreal

I have been eating at Il Focolaio for the past 20 years and am still amazed at how consistently good the service and quality are. They offer over 70 combinations of pizzas an offer a number of items made with either dough or salad. The pizza is made in a wood burning oven.

This places get very busy at noon and people start showing up at 11:45am. By 12:30pm, its difficult to get a seat. They also have a patio in front during the summer. During lunch they also allow a pizza/salad combination to share for two people.

While I still think they need to spend some resources on cleaning up the bathroom it seems that people get in and out quickly and many will never see the bathroom."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite pizza places. The pizza is masterfully cooked in a wood burning oven. The wine selection is very reasonable. The outdoor terrace in the summer adds that lovely Montreal quality I am sure all restaurant owners dream to have. Oh and the service is wonderful!  I believe this place is a Montreal staple. The ambience of the restaurant is a mix of Montreal and Italy and all the customers in the restaurant tend to have smiles on their faces!"}
{"text":"Must eat here... All the solid reviews are bang on. The Italian salad was amazing!  Super fresh ingredients.  They take Amex! Yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good for being in Canada. The delivery man Peter was very friendly and delivered faster then the predicted time."}
{"text":"While on a five day trip to Montreal, my husband and I ate here twice!  The food was excellent quality.  The restaurant focuses on pizza, not a lot of side dishes, so we decided to order three personal pizzas since we normally would order two and a side dish.  We found out that if you buy three, the fourth is free, so we ended up getting to try four varieties.  Each one was awesome and the crust was addictingly good (I am a self-professed hater of crust so this was big!).  We decided to go again our last night, and we ended up getting the same four pizza deal so we could try more.  With over 70 varieties of pizza, there is something for everyone.  Since our hotel was next door, we ordered takeout, but I would say get there early if you want to eat there since it gets very crowded. Obviously it must be a testament to how good it is!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious.  With plenty of options to choose from, you can literally come here weekly to enjoy a different pizza every time for over a year."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to a hotel. Minimum order of $20.00
Lady said it'll come in 45mins I came in less then 30 mins. Ordered #70 portobello omg it was so good. It's thin crust and later of extra cheesy goodness is so delicious. Only thing is it's a bit salty. The almond cake was also a surprise. It's very fresh and tastes amazing. Would try going in next time."}
{"text":"Very cool pizza place.  Their menu is dozens and dozens of combinations, plus you can make up your own.  I made changes and it was no problem.  The pizza was good...but I can't say great.  It's certainly a good sized personal pizza and there are lots of topping options.  I ordered mine with goat cheese instead of mozz.  It came out totally covered in goat cheese, which overpowered the toppings.  Plus, the sauce on mine was too watery.  The crust was very good.  I wanted to like it much more.  That said, I'll give it another shot when I return to Montreal and be very specific about the cheese amount and sauce, if that's possible to change."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and we got seated outdoors promptly around 2pm.   I was very excited to try this place after reading all the great reviews.

They have over 75+ pizzas to choose from....great selection.   We got the grilled chicken pizza and the Italian Salad.  Both were ok, but we've had better.    

The toppings on the pizza tasted fresh, but the chicken was a bit dry and bland.   The crust was not really thin but it was crispy.  I'm glad we tried it, but not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One star because the guy behind the register/bar is an asshole. I called in my order from my hotel because there was a long line outside. I was surprised when he told me it would take only ten minutes. When I expressed my amazement they could turnover an order that quick, he said 10-15 minutes. So I waited 15 minutes and then took the elevator down from the 9th floor and walked over. I paid and waited and waited. It is hot as blazes in there with the wood brick oven. So I asked someone to check on my order and when they asked the guy behind the counter when my order would be ready, he responded, \"when it's ready.\" Asshole. When someone actually went to the kitchen to check, my pizza had \"just gone in.\" I don't care how busy you are, but you should at least be apologetic if your timing is off. Three other waitstaff checked on me and offered freebies which I declined. One of them should be behind the counter rather than the guy there now. They at least knew something about customer service. And if that jerk is not the owner, I want the owner to know this happened on Tuesday, August 9th. I placed my order at 8:06pm and received it at 8:36pm which I would have been fine with if I had been told it would take 30 minutes which is what I normally expect.

As for the pizza itself, crust is not thin as another Yelper reviewed. It seems like regular crust. Thick and chewy. They got a good char on the edges from the oven, but the center was cold. Cheese not melted, meats were cold. Hot sausage tasted old. Beef salami was interesting, but it might have tasted better if it had actually been cooked through and crisped up a bit. I guess that's what happens when they \"rush\" an order."}
{"text":"I've passed by here nearly every day for the past two years, but never thought to go because it looks so unassuming from the outside. The other day for my birthday I really wanted to go to a pizzeria, and my boyfriend found this place online. It had great reviews, so we decided to give it a shot. Oh. My. Goodness. Both of us agreed that it is our favourite restaurant in Montreal, and it's right across the street from our place! There's so many different types of pizza, it's amazing. We both loved that they are personal sized, because since I'm vegetarian and he isn't it can be tricky to order one together. The portions were big enough that I boxed up the rest and had it for lunch the next day. The staff were super friendly, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. It's a cozy little space that's a little dated, but I loved it. The food came very quickly, and it was amazing. I asked for extra cheese, but I didn't need to because they put on enough. Best pizza I've had in a long time. Definitely going to be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Sei italiano? Lascia perdere. Are you north American? You will like it.
Una via di mezzo tra la pizza napoletana e quella romana, ma solo in termini di altezza. Quello che c'è poi sopra è messo li in modo molto americano, con tanto formaggio. Si sente l'aglio.
The dough is good, but the amount of cheese and ingredients reminds the typical north-american pizza."}
{"text":"Went here again and it was just as good as the first time. Definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever had. A lot of choices and the wood burning oven really makes a difference. Everything about this place including the location is pretty good and I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"A group of us met here to have some pizza. Each pizza is approximately 10 inches and personalized based on your number selection. The eight of us each ordered a different one. We all finished each pie as they were so good. You can tell they use fresh ingredients. Gluten free crust is also an option. We washed down the pizza with a house red and white. So good, can't wait to go again next time we visit."}
{"text":"Great salad and Forno fire pizza. Casual and straight forward. Good prices for mid centre of Montreal"}
{"text":"75 choices of pizza...seriously?!?

Although I was skeptical, the pizzas were really good! This place has been in business since 1984."}
{"text":"Un service excellent avec un soucis du détail élevé ! Pizzas délicieuses et une très belle terrasse ! Je conseille vivement !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far in my time in Montreal. It's definitely a friends and family pizza place where you can order just about any variety or kind of pizza. It's usually quite crowded so that means it must be good. My folks and I usually wind up having long discussions over what toppings to get! It's a nice place for family and the pizza goes down well with a bottle of wine :) The crust is thin, the cheese isn't plastic and it has an authentic flair to it."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome - we got the number 8 and number 28 and 2 glasses of sangria.  All came out fast and delicious.  I can see why the line was down the block - well worth it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite food to eat is pizza.  I mean who doesn't love pizza??? I usually go to little Italy but I wanted to try a new place, so came here. It was a Friday night around 9pm, the place was packed, but they managed to find a spot for two. We ordered a parisienne pizza (mushroom, basil, cheese) and a four cheese pizza. We also git a house salad to start off. 

First of all the salad portion was huge, it had everything in it, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, radish, all types of lettuce, and the sauce was excellent, light, refreshing and tasty. If a simple salad can be so good just imagine their pizza. Soon after our pizzas came and boy or boy did it smell good. I dived  right into it and it was so goood. The dough was delicious, crunchy and smell woody, the cheese is so cheeesyy and elastic. The mushroom were really fresh, I truly loved their food. I was really full and the end but could not pass on coffee and fresh cannoli.

At the end of the night I was full and happy."}
{"text":"This is the first pizza place where I've seen so many vegetarian options and they all looked amazing. We settled on the grilled veggie pizza and the house salad. They brought out two plates, both with one half the pizza and half the salad. I love that they went through the effort of separating the food rather than just putting it on the table and letting us struggle with dividing it. 

We were too full for dessert but we would've definitely had some if we had room!"}
{"text":"Best pizza downtown Montreal and one of the best in the city, where pizza competition is tough. 

The crust is not extremely thin, but yet thin enough for me. There are over 70 types of pizza and all I have tried are really good, fresh salads on the menu too. You can add extra ingredients to your pizza, but I would not recommend it, the pizza masters have balanced the toppings perfectly so the pizza would't become soggy. I did the mistake to add more truffles to the Tartufo pizza, it was still yummy, but the truffle taste became overwhelming. Just stick to the menu and there will be no mistake, the wood fired oven helps to perfect the pizza. 

The drinks list is kind of standard, but is perfect for the food prepared in the restaurant, classical selection of Italian wines and house wine offered in different sizes, some local beers on tap.

The location of the pizza restaurant is golden, perfect for all the crazy shoppers who are hungry after tiring stroll on Saint Catherine street. The place is always kind of busy around dinner time. However, the restaurant space is well utilized, service is nice and pizza comes fast, you would not wait too long to get a table. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best pizzas in Montreal! Too Italian! Freshly hand stretched pizzas with so aromatic, flavourful toppings. 

They do around 75 pizza and some sides & salads. Crisp and delicious pizza for everyone! they have categorised each of their pizza into 5 categories- tofu(vegan), vegetarian, cheese, seafood and meat. Very easy to choose from. I go with my non-vegetarian partner and friends, we still end up having vegetarian pizzas all the time, I guess their vegetarian pizzas are the best :P
They have a decent selection of wine. 

We always to a walk-in and although they are full all the time, still we manage to get a seat within 5-10 mins. The seating is very congested, and the place is loud, but I still enjoy it a lot! You feel like Europe! Plus points for Anglophones they speak both French and English, and the service is very Italian - charming and friendly servers! :)

The parking can be a tiny bit tricky, but most of the time We find parking with 50 meters of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great wood oven pizza. Always fresh. Huge selection! Very experienced and fast service."}
{"text":"Love this place
fantastic pizza and fast service
must get a spot on the patio if it's warm outside

Great for an office lunch or a dinner with a big group. Some of the best pizza downtown"}
{"text":"Went in there because of the excellent review status from Yelp. However its very basic pizza quality despite the 75 different pizza options. The middle of the pie was rather mushy. The place has a great ambiance and very family oriented despite being smack dab in the middle of Downtown Montreal.  The service is good, the food good and the restaurant is nice and clean. Just not a mind-blowing pizza experience found at Santa Lucia or Pizza Napolitan. But suitable for a lunch break from work. I just wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"77 different pizza menu items, plus salads and calzones. Really good wood-fired pizzas most were $15 to $16. Noisy, busy and warm at 6:30 on a cold Sunday evening but we were seated immediately and our pizzas were delivered within 10 minutes after we ordered. Definitely worth a visit. I also had a mixed drink from the short drink menu that was well worth the $7 price. 7 items on the dessert menu that were probably wonderful but we've been eating too many desserts so we had to skip, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  We sat outside in cute little square. They have 75 different pizzas. My Hubby had #12 sausage mushrooms etc. the cheese and crust were excellent. I had the grilled veggie salad. It was huge...good for sharing and oddly fabulous. Wait staff was good...I would come back definitely."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had. There are some 75 pizza choices and that doesn't count the calzones and other items. I must admit that I wasn't sure about the place to begin with, but the pizza was great. One thing that is stopping a full five stars is the washrooms. The women in the group did not enjoy going in the dark and not properly maintained (broken tiles) basement to go to the washroom."}
{"text":"I had supper tonight at Pizza Il Focolaio.  I'd eaten here in September and for the most part liked it.  I love love love pizza and that's what I wanted for supper.

I got there just after 6pm and it was jammed.

I ordered the same thing I got the last time ... #28 Peperonato pizza.  They cook the pizzas in a wood oven for about four minutes.  My pizza was delicious!  It was really cheesy and there was lots of pepperoni.  The dough was tasty.  It was a bit burnt on one corner (under the crust) but I ate that side last when I was too full to fuss about it and didn't mind leaving a bit behind.

Dennis was my server.  He was friendly and took good care of me.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews about this place I was pretty excited to try, since I wanted a really good pizza.

Well I still want one because mine (and my girlfriend's) weren't that good.

the toppings were a bit tasteless so even if the crust was great, that's clearly not enough to make a good pizza.
Girlfriend had a pretty bad stomach ache this night and next day, so I can't tell if it's from that or something else but overall well.. The pizza was not what I expected.

Dessert plate was sad and empty too. But cakes ok overall.
Quick service"}
{"text":"3.5

Straddling the line between good old pizza and gourmet. If they're trying for the latter, they'll need a few refinements. The crust is superb. Good use of the wood-fired oven. The next step would be a drier pizza (less oil). And I somehow expected a better cheese. People will pay for fresh whole-milk mozzarella. 

At the price, we'll need a higher quality salad, too. In the matter of salad, quality is more important than quantity.

Still, I'd pretty happily go back."}
{"text":"I expected much more relying on the reviews but I was somewhat disappointed! The pizza I had was really nice and that's the reason for the 2 stars. White sangria was also great and the service was good too, therefore 3 stars.
The salad that I ordered but was not good at all. I expected nice fresh greens with in-house roasted veggies when I ordered this $15 salad with no meat or no exotic topping! It was however a cheap soggy cesare salad topped with not so tasty grilled vegetables. That salad should be priced at $4-5 max.
This place is good if you are going to have only pizza!"}
{"text":"We've ordered for takeout. Pizza was tasty, but really small unfortunately - so I would suggest ordering one per person at least."}
{"text":"I know that this place is overwhelmingly popular and many people are fans of this staple Montréal pizza joint. However, the pizza is mediocre and quite average to be honest. The crust can't really decide whether it wants to be thick or thin so it's at a strange place between. We ordered the Arugula, Carré and the Tartufo. The Arugula one was overly cheesy and the balsamic is overly sweet. The Tartufo (black truffles) was not bad and I did quite enjoy this one.

They have an almost overwhelming amount of options. Although, this means that they will pretty much have something for everyone. This also means that they don't really have a specialty and none of their pizzas really stand out in terms of quality. I would have to say though the service is extremely friendly and efficient. I'd say Focolaio is a slight upgrade from your average pizza lunch but I wouldn't give into the hype that this place receives."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful pizza that I'm still thinking about three days later - easily the best I've eaten outside of Italy. The sauce is simple and bursting with flavor, and the cheese and toppings were best quality. The crust is substantial enough to carry everything but light and crisp enough to showcase the other ingredients. The pesto was outstanding, and the house red delicious. This meal was a highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"De bonnes pizzas !

Je recherchais désespérément une pizzeria italienne dans le centre-ville, et les avis Yelp m'ont menés à Il Focolaio. La devanture du restaurant ne paye VRAIMENT pas de mine, mais contre toute attente les pizzas y sont plutôt bonnes !

Pour ma part, j'ai goûté à la 4 fromages et à la Funginata (avec des pleurotes). Elles ont du goût ! Le bleu de la pizza 4 fromages était bien présent, et les piments de la Funginata donnaient un bon goût relevé et sucré à la fois. En revanche, pour une pizzeria Italienne, je m'attendais à trouver une pâte plus fine...

Niveau prix, c'est très abordable (entre 12$ et 15$). Les pizzas sont néanmoins assez petites, si vous avez un gros appétit, n'hésitez pas à prendre une petite salade ou un dessert à côté !"}
{"text":"After a long week of work it was time to treat my better half and myself for a nice friday night dinner ! Finally the sun was out and so we both felt like beeing on a terasse ! Yelp helped us find this authentic classic wood oven thin crust pizza :)!! Beeing 2 we had a table pretty quickly ! The menu is a simple but the choices are no ending !!! I really appreciated the fact that each type of pizza indicated if it was vegetarian, sea food, cheese, tofu, etc ! It made it very easy to filter it down ! After going thru the over 70 type of pizza i realise there was a continuation on the other side ! My wife and I really didnt know what to choose ! But i felt like this restaurants really helps you to discover yourself because you really have to make up you down so you can narrow down your selection of pizza ! Looking at the back side of the menu even tho they are known for their pizza i got convinced that a veggy submarine is what ill eat ! (When i saw the size of the pizza i knew my wife couldnt finish that on her own and that ill still get some pizza even if i ordered a sub :)!!! The waiter was really nice very caring even tho the terasse was pacted at full capacity the service was beyong my expectations ! We got plenty of time between the time we ordered our pizza and we received so really didnt feel pressured or rushed,even if the waiting line was getting longer ! I had no idea what the submarine could look like but OMG ! Thats exactly what i said when i saw it ! The bread was made of pizza dought cooked in the wood oven ! Great cheese and fancy selection of vegetables ! We were also offered some spicy oil and cayenne pepper flake ! The submarine couldve easily been eaten as a sandwich with your hands but it was also very easy to use a fork and knife to cut it down into smaller pieces ! I got to taste my wifes pizza and again i can say the selection of their veggies is of high quality and fresh ! I will definately go back this summer ! + the absence of ketchup prooved to me how much of a legit italian restaurant it is :)!! I recommend allll the way !"}
{"text":"One of Montreal first & best wood burning pizza! I have the Arugula no.71 and add prosciutto...yum"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and FANTASTIC service!
They pack the tables close together on the outdoor patio but the service was the best we ever experienced. This restaurant is very popular and always busy."}
{"text":"Am staying at a hotel right next door and read great reviews about this place so decided to give them a call and place an order for pick up to take back to the hotel and get some work done. 

Based on the reviews I went with the Tartufo (number 74): mozzarella, goat cheese, black truffles (mixed with anchovies, olives, garlic, parsley, wine, corn oil), cherry tomatoes (with fresh garlic, oregano, basil and olive oil). This was $14.75 plus tax. 

They were very pleasant on the phone (even when I attempted to order in French,  he gently asked if I would prefer to order in English...gosh I guess it has been a while since I used my French!). He said it would be ready in 5 to 10 minutes which was surprising but it was only 5pm on a Sunday so perhaps not their busiest time. 

The pizza itself had a very nice flavour. It is a thin crust pizza and like some thin crusts, I found it just a touch on the oily side in the middle. I was able to eat the whole thing (not the crusts which were slightly black which I know some people like) but depending on your appetite you could split one with 2 people if you had a salad to share too. They are about 10 inch in diameter. 

All in all a pleasant meal, great location (right off Saint Catherine) and friendly service!"}
{"text":"This place really deserves all the good reviews. The sheer variety of pizza is stunning, and the crust--thin, crisp, slightly charred--is terrific! I had a pie with spinach, artichokes, and olives that was the winner of the whole table. The ratatouille pizza was also very good, as was the pie with shrimp. 

Service was prompt and friendly, the location was perfect-- a little bit of a walk from Vieux Montreal, nicely situated for people-watching!"}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza I've had in a while!  Delivery was prompt to our hotel and the delivery guy was great. When the hungry kids are happy, the parents are happy!"}
{"text":"Let me explain. This place is 5 stars for people watching, 3.5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the service. 

We opted to sit outside on a beautiful evening. Outdoor real estate is hard to find in any big city and here you get crammed into a sardine-box of outdoor seating. The table is bolted to the floor and there was a pregnant woman sitting behind me so I couldn't exactly ask her to scoot her chair in. The night we were here there was also an epidemic of bees and rather than target one of the floral frocks around us the bee stung my husband.

We kept it simple. Italian salad and a sausage, mushroom and green pepper pizza. Kudos to them for spitting both and bringing them on separate plates sparing us the hassle.   

The salad was plain, but tasty in its own simple way. The pizza crust was thin, but the toppings a little heavy making it almost necessary to use a fork and knife. Also simple and good.  

Service was slow. I like cozy but this was a little too cozy. Especially when people treated it like an international airport bringing all their luggage in tow causing a spectacle as they try to drag their backpacks, huge purses, and shopping bags in and out.

People watching was excellent and because we were so close we also had the treat of the audio to go along with it."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pizzas! They were delicious and cooked in a traditional oven. The portions were very generous and the service was quick and adequate for the place. I would recommend for anyone who is downtown and needs a quick pizza fix (but not too quick). There were 75 pizzas to choose from so I will certainly be back to try some more."}
{"text":"The place isn't bad. We were in the mood to eat pizza. It's a little congested and the pizza was a lil too cheesy. Still tasted good."}
{"text":"So good, so damn good! Went during lunch and while it was packed, the pizzas came out fast. Great pizza. Tried the pepperoni and also the Hawaiian, both were excellent."}
{"text":"Quality pizza + sangria. Terrace. Great service, yet unpretentious. Felt like I was back in Europe. The ultimate pizza experience in MTL. And all that - downtown. Yum."}
{"text":"Francais après

This is my favorite pizza in Montreal. This place is great for a lot of reason:
1) There's ridiculous amount of different topping, like Rick V says in previous review: like 70 pizza.
2) You can get out of there, tip included for 20$ 
3) The place is always packed and the service is still fast. on lunch hour if you actually have 45-60 minutes lunch and work within 5 minutes walk, you'll make it!
4) Wooden-burning oven. 

First time I went there was with a group of collegue of 15-20 persons and within 75 minutes, we were all done! Pizza is the most delicious fast food on Planet Earth, I could die eating pizza 2-3 times a day for the rest of my live. Topping definition is infinite and therefore, we can make everything in a pizza and this place is a commitment to prove it! 

The Calzonne are super great too

C'est ma pizza favorite à Montréal. Cet endroit est superbe pour plusieurs raisons
1) C'est qu'ils ont un nombre ridicule de garniture. Comme le review précédent le mentionne, plus de 70! 
2) Tu peux quitter le resto le ventre plein pour 20$ après tip.
3) Ce resto est toujours remplis et malgré tout, le service est rapide. Durant l'heure du lunch, si vous avez 45-60 minutes et que vous êtes à 5 minutes du resto a pied, vous pouvez diner là sans revenir en retard au boulot.
4) 3 mots: Four à bois. 

La première fois que je suis allé là, nous étions un groupe de 15-20 collègues et en moins de 75 minutes, tout le monde était servis, avait mangé et payé. La rapidité et la qualité vont de paire pour moi. Ils ont définitivement une recette gagnante.  La pizza c'est, à mon avis, le meilleur fast food au monde. Je pourrais en manger 2-3 fois par jour jusqu'à la fin de mes jours juste à cause de l'infinis possibilité de garniture. Sans compté que ça peut contenir tous les groupes alimentaires en une bouchée! 

Ah et ils ont des Calzone ridiculement bons!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with pizza from this place ! wood oven baked with fresh and tasty ingredients and a wide variety of pizzas and calzones to choose from all at a very reasonable price. The atmosphere is very casual and laid back. The only issue is it does get very full, very fast, so you wanna show up early and seating is a little bit tight inside.That being said the delicious pizza will make the lineup and tight seating quarters a non issue because it will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"Most everyone loves great pizza but can't always agree what that is.  Il Focolaio meets most of my basic pizza must haves.

Crust that leans to the thin side but retains some thickness and texture.
Quality ingredients and a balance of sauce. 
Over 50 choices from anchovies to escargot 
Crisp, fresh and lightly dressed salads large enough for two as an accompaniment
Quickly cooked in a wood fired oven. 
A wine list that is fairly priced by the glass or bottle

In addition Il Focolaio has waiters that know what they are doing and are eager to accommodate their customers.

It can get a little to noisy inside but when everyone is talking about the great food - that's to be expected."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

This place boasts an very extensive menu with every type of pizza you could imagine. 

Came here on a Sunday evening and luckily I made reservations as the place was packed. It was a nice evening so opted for the patio seating. The seating is a little cramped outside, but still it was nice and not too squishy. The calm spring evening also made this experience enjoyable. 

The menu is huge and literally has every pizza you could possible imagine. There's so many choices, truly a destination if you have a party with many preferences. 

The prices are reasonable, and the service is friendly and efficient.

I decided on the classic margherita and I was satisfied. This is less of an authentic Italian margherita pizza, but it was still fresh and tasted great! The cheese was perfectly melted, and the crust was perfectly crisp! 

In all a solid spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas and salads using fresh tasty ingredients. Small place with great staff. The best review I can give it is this, we are from out of town and try not to eat at the same place twice and this place I think I just about have the menu memorized."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch on a Thursday and it was decently crowded, but we only needed to wait about 5 minutes to get seated.

Honestly, it's a bit more expensive than I would've liked for the amount of pizza you get (it's all quite thin and \"gourmet\"), but it tasted quite good. They have a LOT of variety, I noticed roughly 60 different pizzas to choose from, and each pizza is priced at around $15. You can substitute the ingredients on your pizza for alternatives if you like, some of them without paying extra which is nice.

The service was fine, not super courteous but we were all students so maybe that played into it. Our waiter was sometimes slow on filling our water, but the restaurant was quite busy.

The atmosphere is great and the restaurant is nicely decorated.

Overall, I'd recommend this place for anyone craving some pizza with lots of different variety."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever tasted including pizzas in Florence, Roma, and Sorrento.  I believe mine was called the Campagnola.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience ordering out and amazing gluten free crust! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and the pizza is so good. Definitely the best gluten free crust I've ever had. I did takeout, which was fast and easy, but it looked cute inside to sit down as well. Centrally located in downtown, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The restaurant was bi-lingual, super fast delivery and a buy 3 get 1 free.  We all chose margarita pizza.  They were hot and DELICIOUS. We used a credit card to pay and there was no reason to give our information over the phone, the driver had a hand held card reader.  The service was fast.  Was told pizza would be there in 45 mins or less and I was stunned when they knocked on our door.  I'd highly recommend this business."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to grab a pizza to go. I ordered number 18 without the garlic. I love how many vegetarian options they have for pizza. It was hard to pick just one! The service was very friendly. The waitress brought me a glass of water while I waited for my pizza. Only took about ten minutes. This is definitely a gourmet pizza restaurant. The ingredients were fresh, the pizza was thin crust and it was baked perfectly. Absolutely loved it. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Every now and then it happens, you find a place that everyone raves about and it disappoints. This unfortunately was the case with Pizza Focaccia.

The restaurant offers dozens (literally) of personal pizza options with almost any combination of toppings you can think of. I went with the standard Margherita pizza. It was, quite average if I'm
being honest. There was a surprisingly little amount of sauce and the pizza in general seemed to be overcooked as the cheese wasn't runny at all. The taste overall just wasn't great. I also had a salad to start which was just ok.

The restaurant itself is clearly popular with locals as it was jam packed for lunch on a weekday. There are lots of tables and they seem to turn over at a fairly decent pace. 

Definitely was disappointed in this experience. I love pizza, so the reviews suggest that either I just got made a one off bad pizza, or it just isn't as good as everyone has expressed."}
{"text":"Large variété de pizzas cuites au feu de bois.  Pizza un peu petite mais correcte. Possibilité d'emporter."}
{"text":"I had organized a dinner meeting at Il Focolaio with some friends, and I can say, we'll definitely be coming back! Great selection of pizzas, and I love the way you can also customize your own. Their toppings are diverse - from goat cheese, to fig, to truffle oil, you name it! Fresh ingredients, homemade pizzas at inexpensive prices... Who can beat that?!
On the other side, their dessert such as their Tiramisu is not as exciting as their pizzas, it's okay. 
Be prepared when you do plan to come since they can be somewhat crowded and busy. 

Overall, very satisfied of our visit, and cannot wait to come back! I would suggest Pizza #74 (Tartufo) - simply impeccable!"}
{"text":"my fav place for pizza in montreal. their deliveries are good and spicy oil is too good!"}
{"text":"Really good toppings.  Crust was just ok.  Awesome variety and a good price.  And very good service."}
{"text":"We went to this place to have dinner tonight. We were very excited about it after reading all the reviews. It was a big disappointment. We got there and even though they had several tables of four available, they indicated we had to seat in a table of two right in the middle and no more than an inch away from another table of two that was, of course, occupied. We tried to explain the lady that we wanted to have some privacy. We are visiting Montreal. This is our first trip as s couple. She told us that she can't seat us in a table of four because they needed to save those tables \"just in case a party of four shows\". Honestly, this doesn't make any sense. Really?? Just in case? It might be that we are not from here, but in our country, as a client, I have the right to seat where I want to seat, as long as it is my turn and the table I'm requesting is available. Of course we left without having dinner and will never be back to this place or recommend it to someone. Very rude this lady and never showed she cares about our request or us leaving."}
{"text":"Plus de 70 choix de pizza. Delicieux! Place qui n'a l'air de rien de l'extérieur mais c'est à si méprendre. Je vais y retourner, c'est sûr."}
{"text":"We had just arrived in Montreal and needed somewhere to eat to get out of the cold and rain.  We lucked into this place, which at the time was pretty empty. 

We were greeted by a friendly server who promptly took our order.  We got two pizzas which were more than enough for two.  One had peppers and onions and the other had sausage, artichokes and peppers.  Both were very delicious.  

We walked by this place a few times later on and it was always packed.  

I'd describe this place as no-frills decor + excellent pizza  with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my boyfriend. We were seated right away but i found it to be very cramped. I ordered the margherita pizza which I found to be lacking in taste. The crust was excellent though. My boyfriend had the meatball pizza which tasted like spaghetti&meatballs which was cool. Overall I would have to go back to try another kind of pizza! If you're a fan of just cheese pizzas perhaps try the 4-cheese."}
{"text":"short review , the best ,there is absolutely no better pizza in Montreal , don't misunderstand me there is a lot of places in montreal serve great pizza , but this guys are something else."}
{"text":"One of the better pizza joints in Montreal. I had lunch here last week and the place was jam-packed. With a menu which has nearly 90 different pizzas, you're bound to find one you like. Plus it's all made in a  wood-burning oven in the back, rendering the crusts, to be super thin, crispy, and yet substantial enough to hold all toppings. Plus the dough doesn't fill you up to much and to quickly preventing you from enjoying your toppings.
From what I understand, this is pretty close to Neapolitan standards of pizza (Naples is the real home of pizza in Italy) and pretty much all the toppings are those you'd find in Italy but there were a few toppings which I do wished were offered even if they aren't Italian. I love Mexicana pizza so unfortunately there were no hot peppers or ground beef. I was also surprised that there was no granita or tiramisu for dessert, but that's just being nitpicky.
You really cannot go wrong coming here for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed by the pizza here.... especially after reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews. While the service was fine, the food was pretty sub par. The waiter recommended a specialty pizza. It was obviously pre made earlier in the day and served cold. Save your money. You can get a better pizza at the nearby underground mall."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza. Crust just cooked perfectly. Very light. Had the #27 Carré Phillips. Sauce, capicollo, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, ham, mushroom, mozzarella, green pepper. Yummy. Chased down with pint of amber beer."}
{"text":"I've had lots of wood-oven pizza which is always good but this is above-average.  I don't think it was so much the wood oven as it was the sauce that was outstanding.

Having been spoiled by all the great Italian food in St. Louis I wasn't sure what to expect as we found this on the fly while exploring Montreal.  The super-busy atmosphere and super-efficient and friendly service tipped me off that we made a good choice, the food confirmed it.  Had the Margherita pizza and it was outstanding.  Also had a glass of the house red and it was very good.  Ordered the A La Griglin pizza as Vegan (no cheese, gluten-free crust) and it was very good.  

Well worth a visit if you are in the Downtown area of Montreal."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés en groupe pour le lunch. La place est quand meme très bruyante ! Mais les pizzas sont très bonnes ! Ni trop grosses ni trop petites, bien garnies. Je me suis régalée. Vous trouverez sans aucun doute votre bonheur parmi les 75 possibilités :) et tout ça pour un prix très raisonnable (environ 14dollars)."}
{"text":"It's the best experience on a hot summer day to sit out on their patio area and have a pitcher of their sangria and relax. Their pizza has so much filling toppings that you have to eat it with a knife and a fork.
The only negative thing I can say about this place is it is very very busy. The tables outside are tightly packed so I wouldn't recommend going there after a day of shopping because there's no where to put your bags."}
{"text":"Close to our hotel so we tried it out on our first night here. Pizza and calzone were ample, fresh and delicious. Service was fast, friendly and excellent overall. Pricing was just right. We'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, vegetarian gluten free and vegan crust options. I got number 21 vegetarian pizza with broccoli, black olives, spinach and mushrooms and it was so delicious! Service was fast and ambience was great."}
{"text":"Really, really enjoyed this renowned pizza place in the heart of Phillips Square in downtown Montreal.   Over 70 individual sized pies with mixed toppings to choose from, and they all looked great.  Sensational crust, cooked just well enough to be charred but still really chewy, and fresh ingredients really hit the mark. Place was packed on a Saturday afternoon at 2:30 and for good reason.  Ordered the eggplant, garlic, and olive pie and can't say enough about how tasty it was and how much I like olives on pizza.  My wife had the vegetable pie, packed high with mushrooms, artichoke hearts, garlic, tomatoes, and more.  Exceptionally fresh and delicious.   After a week of eating awesome French meals, breakfast through dinner, I was dying for pizza, and this place lived up to its billing.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the pesto chicken pizza and it was really good. You could just tell that the ingredients were fresh unlike the cheap 10 dollar large pizzas you would normally order. The cheese was really soft and stringy, the tomato sauce was real and the chicken was tender as well! If you want some authentic italian pizza with good ingredients order here! It's slightly more pricey but its worth it if you're tired of normal fast food pizzas. They also have a lot of variety to choose from and deliver super fast!"}
{"text":"67 Canadian dollars for 3 personal size pizzas, one beer and 2 cokes?! Though the pizza was decent, the price point is crazy. I'd think again."}
{"text":"I was scanning Yelp! for a dinner place for me and one of my team members from work. We are staying in the Marriott Courtyard Hotel on René Levesque in downtown Montreal. It was raining and I didn't want to walk too far so this place looked like a good opportunity. Wow, what a find!

We got a pitcher of blind ale on tap to start with, then went for entrees. Since it has a rep as having the \"best pizza in Montreal\" I thought I'd get a #32 - cheese, tomato, ham, and some other stuff. Thin-crusted, crispy greatness! My partner got a \"Volcano\" calzone which has some meats and a bit of spice to it. He said it was not quite as spicy as he had thought from the description, but it was still delicious anyways. Beer was great, too. 

Service was fast and friendly. They picked up that we are not French speakers before we had a chance to speak. Our orders cooked up quickly - almost surprisingly so- despite the full house. Tables are set tightly, as you'd find in Europe. Lots of local folks, I think, which is one of the reasons I had good vibes when we walked in. There is a lot of great food in Montreal, and the scene is competitive. 

We didn't try the veggie options, but they have some. Not vegan, but meat free. We are gonna tell our Indian folks on the team about it.

We have a few days here for a conference. I could come here again."}
{"text":"If you have eaten here you got a taste of The Italian hospitality !
More than you expect  in a large dish full of
Lots of Cheese & more Cheese & all the 
Other decorations that comes with it toped 
With great service.
We were greeted by the owners himself And was pleased with the taste of Italia :))
I am for sure going back there again for a 
Bite of the famous La Pizza.

Gratsia."}
{"text":"This  is my second time here and it was great like I remembered Service was fast friendly . Great Montreal lunch cold beer and yummy pizza , Very busy but worth the wait slightly less people if you go after busy lunch hour ."}
{"text":"If there is a better pizza place than this place, please let me know. As a former student that survived solely on pizza I know a good pizza. This place takes what your senses expect to be just another Italian pizza place with traditional pizza and then it goes over and beyond any conceivable concept of the word scrumptious. Absolutely scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Maple burning oven - thin crust pizza - varied and well done menu - great Sangria at a reasonable price - wonderful setting - super friendly staff - very affordable.  That says it all!  If you love PIZZA - this is the best I've found in a city full of pizzerias."}
{"text":"LOVED THEIR PIZZA. 

I'd say is comparable to pizza in Italy. The menu is almost endless. Any kind of pizza you want.

We ended up at this place on a whim because it was near our hotel and i was really impressed. The following day when i got on yelp to look for restaurants I was not surprised to see this restaurant at the top of the list.  

The meats are perfect. The veggies are fresh and they give you oil and pepper flakes. 

BF had a calzone and said it was great. 

Canolis were good too."}
{"text":"Had a margherita pizza (my belief is if you can't do that well, don't bother with the other types of pizza) and it was AWESOME. Right balance of cheese, sauce, and basil. The crust was the perfect thickness while the pizza was thin. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pizza is a deeply personal thing. While most of us can tell what is a good pizza and what is a bad pizza, it is the differentiation between good pizzas where people argue. Details like the tang of the tomato sauce, the amount of each ingredient present, thin crust vs. thick crust.... all of these lead to many discussions about which pizza is \"best\". Here in Montreal, we are spoiled with many great options. Personally, I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza and a certain place in Little Italy right now that I won't mention here to avoid direct comparison through this post. I took my girlfriend there and while she enjoyed it, she told me that she preferred her personal spot. And thus, we had no choice but to go to Il Focolaio right by Phillips Square to see how it would rank for me.

Open since 1984, Il Focolaio does thin crust pizza in a maple wood burning oven. The crazy part about their menu is that they have 75 different pizzas! That is an insane number and frankly one that made me a little scared.... when a menu gets that big, I wonder how many can be truly great. I still kept an open mind and plus it was a beautiful night so we sat on the terrasse with a beer ready to enjoy some pizzas.

Given we had an friend with us on this Friday night, we tried three pizzas. First up was La Milanese - tomato sauce, artichoke hearts, capicollo, mushrooms, black olives and mozzarella. A nice crispy crust on the underside - the pizza held up to grabbing with one hand. On the flip side, I found the top of the crust to be a little burnt in spots and a little too flaky to my liking. In an ideal world, I want crunch but still chewy once I bit in. All three pizzas were the same so they are consistent with the cooking in the oven. In this instance, I suppose it is more a matter of personal taste. Each pizza is about 12 inches so a solid size as a personal pizza. Plenty of ingredients as well which cover the entirety of the pizza. This particular mix of ingredients wasn't my favourite - I liked the fatty capicollo and the mozzarella but I've never found artichokes and mushrooms very enjoyable on a pizza especially if they are rough cut as they were. I also hate olives - I guess you can tell by now this wasn't my choice - which didn't help.

Our second pizza was the Spinarto - Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, artichokes, mozzarella and olives. This one - again not my choice... darn olives! - was more enjoyable to me. The garlic and spinach worked well and somehow helped to make the artichokes less noticeable to me.

Finally we get to my choice, the Renaissance - Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, olives, mozzarella and spicy pancetta... without the olives of course! The extra kick of the pancetta gave this pizza more bite compared to the more vegetarian pizzas we had before. Also the cheese was a little bit more golden on the top than the previous ones which provided a little different flavour and texture. Pretty enjoyable to me.

Lastly, while Il Focolaio doesn't have many things on the menu other than pizzas, they do have Sicilian cannolis which I can never say no to! Solid crunchy shell with a nice creamy filling, these were a solid way to finish off the meal.

In the end, I enjoyed Il Focolaio but its pizza didn't blow me away. It's definitely the best one in the downtown core I've tried so but left me firmly believing in my own personal favourite at the moment. My girlfriend didn't succeed in swaying me which means that pizza will remain a point of contention between the two of us. Guess we will just have to alternate between spots for a while if we want harmony to remain!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night and the place was packed! The service of the cleaning waiter was amazing but the person who actually took our order was not the friendliest. We got #40 and the pizza was pretty good actually but not big enough for 2 they are all individual pizzas. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Came in around noon on a i day with my boyfriend. It was empty, so we picked a seat by the window. 

It's quite a charming place. The waiters are very sweet. They checked on us after we got our food and came to fill our water whenever we were running low. 

They have such a huge menu! Luckily for me, my boyfriend already came and he recommended the volcano calzone, so I didn't have to waste time figuring out what I want and we just split a volcano. 

It came quite quickly, but again, it wasn't a busy morning, so I'm not sure what the service is usually like. They even cut it in half for us and brought it over on two plates. I thought that was a very nice touch. Usually, restaurants bring the food on a plate and bring an empty plate to let us split it ourselves. The portion was quite large! I was definitely full after my half of the calzone. 

The calzone itself tasted quite good! The crust was the best I've ever had. It was thin and crunchy without being hard and destroying your palate. It was just... perfect!! The put spicy oil and pepper flakes on the side so that you can put however much you want. 

I'm not a huge fan of pizza/calzones, but this is definitely where I want to go if I ever have a craving. I wasn't as mind blown by the food as yummy boyfriend, but that might just be because Im not a big pizza fan to begin with. 

Overall, friendly and efficient service, good food, nice atmosphere!

The only little thing I don't like is that the tables are quite close together. I had my backpack on and I had to take it off in order to navigate my way to the exit. I imagine it must be a little stuffy when it's busy, but I haven't experienced it"}
{"text":"Un choix assez incroyable de pizza au four à bois.  Bon service et rapport qualité prix.
Seul bémol, c'est un resto très bruyant à l'heure du lunch."}
{"text":"Tres bonne pizza , bon service , bcp de tables. Je trouve juste qu'ils devraient se forcer sur la propeté .. le couloir vers la salle de bain .. etc"}
{"text":"We found this cool place on yelp. Decided we wanted some Pizza and it was convenient from our hotel. 

They pack an amazing number of tables into the place but it works. We were quickly seated and our waitress was super attentive. 

The menu - they have like 75 pizzas. Lots of different options. Almost overwhelming but once you figure it out it's ok. If you can't find a pizza you love here, you're not trying. 

The food was delicious. The chicken pesto pizza was amazing.  My wife's pizza was also very good.  Food was out quickly after ordering. 

Both the experience and food were really good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious. Period. Poor wine selection & extremely casual, but the pizza is so good you want to linger on tthe street patio all night just to keep smelling it after you gorge yourself"}
{"text":"A completely forgettable meal. Best part was the Canada Dry Ginger ale. Italian salad had tasteless dressing, pizza has virtually no sauce and taste, even though it was ordered with garlic. Spinach on pizza tasted like it was frozen. Very noisy and crowded tables. Not sure why the high reviews."}
{"text":"Wow, sérieusement, Wow. Je n'avais pas une très grande idée de selon j'allais trouver. Un restaurant italien, pas très grand, qui sert plus de 50 sortes de pizza, quelque sous marin, pas de pâte (Mais c'est italien?). Surprise, c'est plus que excellent.

La pizza est d'une taille un peu plus grande que small. La pâte est faite maison à partir d'ingrédients de qualité, Et ça se goûte. La pâte peut être sans gluten et le fromage sans lactose végétalien! Pour les allergies multiples, simplement avertir et les précautions seront alors prises. Ils indiquent aussi quel mets peut contenir des allergies populaire comme les noix (Oui des pizza avec des noix!).

J'ai essayé la pizza carré Philips. Sauce, capicolo, sauce italienne épicé, fromage, champignon, poivron et jambon. Une pizza de se genre est normalement grasse et lourde. Mais non, elle est légère. Oui, une pizza légère! Vous serez tout de même plein lorsque vous allez la terminé. Tout les ingrédient de la pizza était aussi frais et de qualité que ceux utilisé dans la pâte.

Il s'agit de pizza cuit dans un four à bois d'érable avec des pizza pâte pas trop mince (pas mince mais pas grosse).

Prochaine fois, Je crois que je vais essayer les sous marin (quelques choix, pas la spécialité mais je suis curieux)

Certes, si vous êtes adepte de pizza grasse et lourde des pizzeria à grande chaîne comme dominos, pizza Hut ou les 2 pour 1, vous serez déçu. Mais si vous avez l'esprit ouvert ou rechercher de la vrai pizza maison de qualité à bon prix, cette place vaut le détour."}
{"text":"I had to check out this place when I heard there were over 80 options! I went with the margherita though because I think it is the best pizza to judge a pizza place on for the first try. The crust was good enough, a little difficult to chew/cut but tasty nonetheless. The cheese was not my favorite and quite greasy. I wish that the basil tasted a bit more fresh but it still hit the spot. (Doesn't all pizza?) I would love to try more flavors to be able to more fairly judge the place. It seemed like a very popular spot. I went around lunch time with a friend and found that it was jam packed with businessmen in suits and felt a little underdressed. I'm not sure if this is how it is always or if it was just the time of day when business people come in. The waiter was friendly and it was a pleasant place with a great location downtown! I hope to be back soon to try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm. Food was more memorable than the service but no complaints. Not a very big place and it gets REALLY packed but the pizza makes up for it."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and it was fantastic!  Service and quality were excellent.  They were happy to accommodate our special request to leave certain items off. 

There are about 70 options for pizza and we can't wait to try more!"}
