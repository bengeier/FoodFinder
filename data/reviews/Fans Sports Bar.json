{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to gamble and chill. They have the bowling cafeteria next to them. Try their burgers and chilli fries. You wont be dissaponted. Ask for Paulie, he is a really kind and funny bartender."}
{"text":"Wanted a good burger and fries...burger was ok, fries were hot but mushy.  Could not get them replaced because after I got my meal, neither of the 2 bartenders walked over to ask how my meals was, they were to busy pushing beers on the regulars and talking 'brackets\" to take care of other patrons. When I finally got their attention to have my water re-filled..I got attitude by the 7 foot bartender.  Local, going to Suncoast for years...stay away unless you like \"attitude\" and poor service."}
{"text":"Came to Suncoast for the first time, gambled a little and then stopped here for a drink and quick bite. The menu isn't good for Vegans/Vegetarians but the service was great and my buddy liked the wings and chili fries that he ordered. I won't eat there, but it's a great spot for a drink."}
