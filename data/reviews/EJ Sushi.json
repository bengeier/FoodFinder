{"text":"Sushi tasted fresh and the rolls were good sized.  Small shop, limited seating.  The owners were very nice.  Everything was a la carte, no fountain drinks."}
{"text":"For a small little place, I didn't expect much for sushi. I got the dynamite roll special and it blew me away! It's family run and very white inside. 

Back to the rolls: got take out and the rolls wasn't covered in rice. It had speckled of rice (great for my lo carb diet) but it looks pretty against the seaweed. 
The shrimp was crispy and delicious, and it comes w a soup. Everything I needed for $7. 

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick fix. The fish to rice ratio for their sushi is perfect (little rice, lots of fish). Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't let the aesthetics fool you- this place is great. It's in a rougher part of town and the inside isn't \"nice\", but the food is great and reasonably priced. 

The salmon here is always fresh and pinkish vs. the light orange that you get in less-than-fresh sushi joints. The rolls are filled with lots of stuff on the inside with a thin layer of rice- just the way rolls should be. 

The service has always been friendly. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far the best Sushi in the Cityplace area!
This family run business stays true to the quality and freshness of their ingredients!
The result is consistency and deliciousness.
Very affordable lunch specials"}
{"text":"As someone who loves sushi, this place is appalling and part of the general category of \"garbage sushi\". The fish is precut and minuscule. The rice is dry and crumbly and the quality is as low as it can be without being a risk to your health. The avocado salad had only white iceberg lettuce and the miso soup was so thin it was like water. The tamago was frozen and cut into triangles. For $36 it was a colossal rip off compared to even the other bad all you can eat places. To cap it off, the decor is so empty and bland it reminded me of an unfinished old folks home lobby."}
{"text":"The rolls here are very very small but I don't question the quality and freshness of their ingredients.  Good place to get your sushi/maki fix if you're in the area.  Seems to be strictly take-out."}
{"text":"Tried this place for takeout -  was not impressed. Ordered SPICY tuna rolls and yam rolls. 

These were the smallest rolls I've ever seen. They seaweed wasn't even covered with rice. Barely any rice. 

For 11$ at a budget sushi place you should be at least satisfied and I was still hungry :(

Also, there was a grey hair in my sushi. Which is definitely mine. 

MiNe sushi is waaaaaay Better for a few dollars more."}
{"text":"Brand new sushi shop that just opened up in the Corktown neighborhood. They still have yet to get their liquor license, but that shouldn't stop you from trying their tasty sushi pizza (just the way I like it with lots of toppings and a thin layer of rice). Had the avocado salad as well, and was quite pleased with the amount of avocado given.  The spicy salmon had a fun crisscross mayo design on top, and the flavour didn't disappoint.  Definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"$1.99 miso soup that tasted like hot water with salt and three tiny pieces of tofu added.  It should have been complimentary. 

My gf and I shared a Toronto roll and an avocado roll. Both were quite flavorless even though the Toronto roll was described as being spicy. 

This truly was one of the worst sushi experiences we have ever had. 

I've been to Japan several times and lived in Asia for a while. So I know good sushi."}
{"text":"Hey folks. If you are looking for nice fancy place that's not for you but if you are looking for fresh fish an tasty food you definitely should check it. This place is mostly for pickup and if you decide to visit don't be surprised of two tables inside other than that as I mention quality food was one of the best in downtown. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am shocked that this restaurant has a 4 star rating. This is now officially the worst sushi place I have ever been to in my life, so I guess that's a milestone. Where to begin, ordered 40 dollars worth of food. Miso soup was basically hot water, the shrimp tempura was pure batter and basically no shrimp, now the worst part, there was basically no rice on the maki!!! It was basically a seaweed roll with bits of rice. The roles were tiny as well. So I walked in to pick it up and the place looked horrible. Basically one table to eat and smelt horrible. Worst than all you can eat food with a la Cart prices."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to understand why this place has a 4 star rating. I ordered the lunch special and they were the saddest rolls I have ever laid eyes on. I regret not walking down the street to the dozens of other sushi places in the area. 

The use of rice is so sparing it hardly envelopes the seaweed. The potion size is so small. Sure the taste isn't bad but as a take out sushi joint with the smallest portions I have ever seen and above average prices, I don't see why I would ever go back again."}
{"text":"Located in Front St. Ej sushi is a great place for some quick fresh sushi. I enjoy there Salmons lovers roll the most and I like how they don't over load the sushi rolls with rice. The owners are very kind too! I would recommend to check it out and stop buying your sushi from rabba next door."}
{"text":"A bit embarrassed I used my limited dining quota here. The rolls were made to order but weren't all that special. If you're super hungry and in the neighborhood it'll suffice."}
{"text":"I work nearby, and I just found this gem via yelp. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews, the food is extremely fresh and delicious and prices are super reasonable!

They have all-day specials from $11-14, and they come with a miso soup and salad as well. It's definitely my go-to lunch spot from now on (soooo much better than the other take-out sushi place in the area I won't name). Their cuts are super generous, and the fish are sooooo fresh!

It's a mom and pop shop, run by an older Korean couple. They are so cute and so nice! They remember me the second time I went, and always has a smile on their faces.

I've only had their sushi so far, but I'm going to try their bento boxes next time :)"}
{"text":"I love their crunch roll with a side of spicy mayo. Like their lunch specials too, wouldn't mind have a little more rice that what they add normally."}
{"text":"This is a local mom-and-pop sushi spot that's been around for a little over a year. Yes it's next to a boxing gym but that's Toronto for you but who cares? The sushi and sashimi is super fresh, made with care, and the owner is the sweetest! Wasabi is strong and on-point also. I usually get the 32 piece combo and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their Sushi Roll Combo, which was all day deal for $13. Miso soup and mini salad come along with the combo, and both were very decent. The avocado in California Roll was the biggest I've ever seen. Only thing I wanna note is their tuna. It wasn't the worst, but I could feel a bit of fishy taste that I hate about mediocre sushi. Overall, it was good. The lady in the restaurant was really nice that I wanna go back just because of her!"}
{"text":"Family owned sushi place conveniently located in the hood!!

Decent for a quick fix. Support small businesses and check them out. Don't expect to be blown away but appreciate"}
