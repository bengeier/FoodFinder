{"text":"We made our reservation last minute and to our surprise, it was some of the best sushi we've had in Montreal in a long time. Though a little more expensive than other sushi joints, Kyo Bar Japonais is the place to come if you want a romantic sushi dinner with your beau. They have a great selection of cocktails, wines, and sakes as well and I'm definitely going back in the near future to enjoy more of their sushi! We had friendly service, though the service was a little slow in my opinion, compared to the number of customers in the restaurant (about 1/4 full), but there was only one waitress that was taking all the orders, checking up on the customers, and serving the food, so it was understandable. Everything was clean and presentable, and most of all, the quality of the sashimi & sushi was very fresh and not frozen!"}
{"text":"music waaaaay too loud, strange song selection/genre confusion and sound system is not the greatest, perhaps poorly configured...idk, but it sucked to yell across the table all night that we just gave up on conversation, ate and left.  the sushi rice missing that touch of sweet so a little on the bland side, but otherwise fresh and served quickly. service a little uptight.  I expected more overall considering the reviews..."}
{"text":"I had my eye on this dish since the moment I saw it on the menu. Hamachi dol sot bi bim bap - A Korean influenced dish. A screaming hot stone bowl filled with seasoned rice, shimieji mushrooms, homemade kim chi, cucumber, slices of yellowtail tuna and topped with a raw egg yolk.  Served with a side of sweet and spicy sauce, we were instructed to pour it over top and mix up the bowl; the umami was off the charts. The sweetness from the sauce, tartness from the kimchi, savoriness from the mushrooms, bitterness from the charred rice on the inside of the bowl was all brought together by the broken yolk that made each bite creamy and delicious. My olfactory senses were being seduced with this Hamachi bi bim bap. This dish slid up, offered a drink then took my palate out back and had its way with it."}
{"text":"We went at about 9:30 on A Saturday night in early December. Good vibe, all around busy spot with good energy. The red wine was excellent, as was the unfiltered sake (they have a large sake selection). We didn't order too much sushi so I can't say much about how it compares - but what we did get was definitely fine (and reasonably priced). The music at a good volume without being too loud to talk, and the service was excellent. Very nice start for a night out in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent food/service. A little pricey but worth it!! Seaweed salad is nice and fresh.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Given its price, this suchi bar is really mediocre for its taste. The quantity is really small so be cautious that what you ordered might not be enough. Remember to listen to the waiter's recommendation for the number of courses."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! My parents and I ate at Kyo Bar Japonaise while on vacation in old Montreal on a Fri night and loved it so much we went back the next night. Very friendly and attentive staff and manager. Try the following and you won't be disappointed: scallops, braised pork belly, beef tongue, short ribs, chicken wings, Unagi, Kyo and Rainbow roll. And save room for desert - you do not want to miss the Donuts or the Bread Pudding! So many more items to try, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Went here based on a friend's recommendation for sushi and just had an excellent meal. All the rolls and sashimi were so fresh. Our waitress recommended the bread pudding for dessert and that was a good call by her. Classy interior and nice service. The menu can be a bit pricey to some but to me it was worth it. I would definitely dine here again next time I come to Montreal."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est beau et l'ambiance est agréable.   Par contre, la nourriture, du moins ce qu'on a mangé, était assez ordinaire pour le prix chargé. Mentionnons que le service était excellent.  Conseils:  - Ne prenez pas la crêpe japonaise aux fruits de mer! C'est mauvais, pleins de mayonnaise et trop lourd! - Essayez un sake, ils sauront vous conseiller. - Les moules japonaises sont excellentes.  Heureux d'avoir essayé mais je ne recommande pas cet endroit."}
{"text":"Best sashimi in Montréal (to me least) + good service"}
{"text":"I like the place itself  The service is very good  The food is super   Snake Rainbow Eel  Sashimi  All good"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est tranquille et moderne. Les nourritures sont délicieux et typiquement fait pour les locaux. Dans le quartier du Vieux-port, c'est conseillé d'y aller!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  The atmosphere is nice but service is pretty bad.  Ordered several sushi rolls, a side of kimchi, miso soup and edamame for starters.  The edamame took almost an hour to come out which is strange because you would think they have that just sitting in the back ready to go.  Then our rolls started coming out.  We inquired about the miso soup but were told that the regular chefs area was backed up while the sushi station was running on normal speed and that it would be out shortly.  This didn't make any sense because again, you would think they have miso soup sitting in the back ready to go.  Anyways we get everything except for the miso soup and a side of kimchi and the waiter brings us the bill with everything on it!  When we told him that we had never received the miso soup or the side of kimchi and he said he would bring it out right away since they have it sitting in the back ready to go.  Either our waitress who brought out our food lied to us or our waiter was lying to us.  Either way, we declined and asked them to just remove the items from our bill.  After waiting another 10 minutes for the new bill with no apology we paid and promptly left.  All in all, service was really slow and lacking.  We were there for about 2 hours and the restaurant wasn't exactly busy.  Sushi wasn't anything special....about the same as any other sushi place and it would have been much cheaper to have had dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh, simple, and tasty. Amazing service. Music was good and not too loud. Try their steamed spinach salad and the salmon tartar."}
{"text":"We found this delightful restaurant near our hotel in October and were very pleased. The food was delicious and we especially loved the tapas style menu. Sophie and Guillaume were gracious and attentive servers. If we are ever in Montreal again we will definitely return and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. Location, decor and ambience were also great!"}
{"text":"The worst japanese food I have had in years, it is so bad for its price. I really wished it was possible to give a zero star. Their spinach salad's sesame sauce was so thick and so greasy, their tempura was really greasy that I wanted to puke it out after two pieces, their chicken wings were soaked in soy sauce and super salty and their cocktail has no taste of alcohol what so ever. Everything there seem to have so much salt and grease it was almost like if a fast food chain did it. And all this at their high price? You can find way better and more authentic izakaya food anywhere else at that price."}
{"text":"I am not by no means a japanese food specialist, but the food was really good. We tried an assortment of different things, sashimi, makis, the beef and salmon that is seared on the sides, it was very tasty, both me and my friend felt the same thing. Atmosphere is really nice, I love the design of the place, simple yet nice. There was live music and dj was spinning great music tbh. The staff were very friendly, perticularly the bartender. I would recommend this place to anyone, and especially to couples. Price-wise i think it was fine, looking at the experience and food quality it wasnt bad, i think our bill was about 130$ tax and tips included for 2 people with one drink each, and we were i would say full."}
{"text":"Un véritable coup de coeur pour leurs lunchs.   Leur menu midi entre 14 et 20$ comprend une entrée, un plat et un thé. C'est pas cher, c'est ultra savoureux et l'ambiance est bien calme le midi.   En entrée, je vous suggère la salade de laitue ice burg et d'algues qui est tellement bonne que j'ai eu du mal à partager avec mon ami, mais je dois avouer que sa soupe miso était tout aussi délicieuse.   Comme plat principal, le porc frit coupé en lanière recouvert de sauce sucrée et accompagné de riz et de salade de chou est une bonne option, mais selon moi, la boite bento est ce qui vaut le plus le détour. La boîte contient 4 compartiments contenant des échantillons de différents plats: salade de nouilles soba, 6 makis, crevettes tempura et une protéine de votre choix (poulet, boeuf ou saumon mariné).   Pour ceux qui voudraient en apprendre un peu plus sur les différents types de sakés, vous êtes au bon endroit! La carte des alcool en offre une belle sélection et il est également possible d'obtenir une dégustation de 4 sakés différents pour 20$. Très bonne idée pour les comparer et se situer un peu plus par rapport à nos goûts. Le soir, l'endroit offre également une carte de cocktails maisons (dont plusieurs à base de saké) qui ont l'air délicieux!   Vraiment, j'ai adoré."}
{"text":"Had dinner.  The shogun roll was excellent. I also enjoyed the spinach salad.  The atmosphere was also very nice.  Defiantly come again."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the amazing meal my husband and I had with our 4 kids (who are complete sushi snobs from NYC). Pascal, our server, was incredible. Good food, good service and ambience, not sure what else one would want.... must try the donuts for dessert too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. Fun atmosphere! Did I mention the food?  So good!  Try a Kamikaze roll!"}
{"text":"We were in town for race weekend and were excited for fresh sushi. Unfortunately we encountered the worst service I've experienced in years AND the food was mediocre. We had made a reservation and were seated when we walked in however we then waited about 20 minutes before we had water or were acknowledged. We would have left but it was late and we were hungry. The waitress finally came to the table (which was strange as we didn't think it was her that would be serving us since she had probably passed by the table a dozen times) and took our drink and appetizer order. The cold sake we ordered was good but wasn't cold and it took quite a while for the waitress to finally come back with the ice bucket. Meanwhile she was at the table behind us drinking with those customers. The bad service continued, we rarely saw her. Had to ask to place our dinner order and for the appetizer to be cleared away after it had been sitting for a good 20-25 min (she had been walking past this whole time) and our menus were at our table the entire time we were there. The sushi was just OK, nothing I would recommend but maybe because it had been sitting waiting to make it to our table. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place when there are so many options in Montreal, we were there for hours and it was not worth it! The tables that were seated behind us seemed to face to same issues as we heard them complaining as well, not sure if it was because we all spoke English but as a tourist I would avoid!"}
{"text":"I'd pass.  This is a restaurant confused about its identity.  There is no confusion, however, about its food - not very good.  Food first.  We ordered the agedashi tofu, the grilled beef tongue, a rainbow maki and salmon sashimi.  We also tried to order the grilled beef tenderloin.  However, on a Saturday night at 9, they had already run out.  How do you run out of an izakaya staple like that on Saturday night?!?  That should've been a hint right there.  The agedashi tofu had a nice warm exterior with a hint of a crunch.  Good so far.  However, the inside was still ice cold.  Fine, not everyone makes their own fresh tofu, and Kyo certainly doesn't aspire to that level of Japanese authenticity, but, at the very least, let your tofu rest to room temperature fully.  All four portions were like this.  And that is not how it should be.  The beef tongue should have a sear on it.  It's a very quick cook.  Instead, it was more like a braised tongue.  No sear.  A grey soggy mess.  More like a braise or a boiled tongue...  No complaints about the salmon sashimi, but one of the fishes in the rainbow roll had a slight off taste to it.  My own fault for ordering sushi at an izakaya...  Kyo is in an upscale boutique hotel.  All the guests were very nicely dressed.  Upscale, adult venue one would think.  So, I was a bit surprised and un-nerved when the waitresses started shouting sake bomb verses at the top of their lungs.  Ummmm, not very classy.  This behavior makes sense and belongs at Imadake and even Kinka near Concordia.  Here, not so much.  You've got a high price point, well dressed clientele and you want your waitresses to be acting like they're at a frat party???  Oh, and the waitstaff is slow, too.  It took 15 minutes before the waitress came back to take our dinner order.  And at the end, 10 minutes before we got our check, after flagging the waitress back.  The only good thing about Kyo was the aforementioned well-heeled guests.  A plethora of eye candy.  Of course, the girl chose this spot.  Unfortunately, with the girl, I couldn't ogle the other beautiful guests as much as I would've liked.  Oh well.  =)  Altogether a frustrating experience.  I'll just stick with Imadake (for a rowdy time) or Kinka (for a more measured tone) next time."}
{"text":"Went to Kyo with 3 other business colleagues during our trip from Chicago. We ended up sitting at the bar and the service and food was amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal as we had a wonderful experience. Thanks for a memorable outing!"}
{"text":"Went here on busy Saturday night since place looked happening.  Started off great getting seats at sushi bar.  The two shrimp tacos app was okay.  Then we ordered 3 maki rolls and nigiri sampler. Two of the maki rolls were a \"special order\" of just cucumber and crab. We were charged for the most expensive maki roll on the menu for the two rolls. None of the orders came out together. One of the specially made rolls came out made incorrectly. It took 45 minutes for the order to be corrected and an additional 15 minutes for the third maki roll to be made. We also ordered a drink and saw it sitting on the bar across from us for over 10 minutes. One of us left for a few minutes and the manager tried to take their seat away.  We spent over 2 hours and 120$ and still left hungry."}
{"text":"So here goes.. Nigiri maguro, sashimi hamashi, rainbow, gaijin, California maki and kamikaze ... simply amazing ! Do not miss eating there if you're anywhere near the old port."}
{"text":"Great food, prompt and friendly service, pleasant atmosphere.   I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"KYO is a fabulous Japanese fusion restaurant! I've had their delicious sushi and many other plates that were delicious. The hidden jem of this place is their dessert; a donut dipped in a sort of white sauce. No words can describe how amazing it tastes."}
{"text":"I recently visited Kyo Bar during Le Happening Gourmand, and they were offering a set menu for $26. As a starter, my gf and I split beef sashimi, and tuna tataki, both of which were absolutely delicious. The sashimi was especially delicious, garnished with a lovely sweet sauce and crispy slices of thin garlic. Our mains were Udon noodles and a type of BBQ chicken, both SO GOOD. The chicken was juicy, tender, and beautifully marked by the grill. For dessert we had a soft cake with matcha powder on top, berries on the side with a cheesecake type sauce. The combo was lovely. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is very busy, but chill and sleek. I would highly recommend visiting here, especially on a date!"}
{"text":"Je recommande definitivement cet endroit pour une date! Nous avions une reservation pour deux un vendredi soir (je conseil de prendre une reservation les soir de fin de semaine) la nourriture etait delicieuse et abordable! Très bon service et l'ambiance est superbe!  J'y retournerai sans hesitation!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Food was extraordinary. Great balance in almost all dishes. The seafood crepe although it has good flavor was overpowered with spicy mayo. The sashimi and sushi were really fresh. The service was adequate. Atmosphere is great. Totally recommend it. Ah! Don't forget to ask for the beignets for dessert they were of the charts."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Japanese cuisine and working in Japanese restaurants, I decided to have my birthday dinner here with my boyfriend. Made reservations via open table a week in advance as it was Igloo festival and Happening Gourmand weekend. I added a comment it was my birthday. Upon arrival my reservations were not in the system. I showed the gentleman at the front my email confirmation on my smartphone. He said it was no problem and he would find us a seat. We were seated at the round table by the window which seats 4 so it was spacious but a bit cold. The man came back to the table and said he found my reservation in the system. Overall the food for me was average. The menu is limited to a few dishes only, for $25 no alcohol.   My dishes were the sunomono salad to start  ( Harusame noodles, cucumber, coriander, wakame, kani crab). I liked it as it was light with flavor. I tried the spicy salmon maki but found it lacked being spicey. My main dish was the chicken yaki (mirin marinated chicken thigh with rice). I was not impressed with it as it lacked flavor and was not very warm as it was served. I enjoy sauce with my chicken and it was missing from this dish. I had the pinky ginger cocktail which was an extra $11. It was tasty with ginger, lychee and raspberry purée. I finished with dessert the Yuzu donuts with condensed milk and black sesame. Good portion size as it comes with 3 donuts. I took mine off the chopstick and soaked it in the milk. This was my 2nd visit here, it was more memorable the last time. The service was average nothing over the top. There was different waitresses coming to the table. The ambiance and decor is good, the music was good as they played R&B from the 90s. My boyfriend said it was way too loud for his taste. For my birthday there was no extra dessert brought out, perhaps we had to mention it."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some rolls so I came to the closest place to my hotel.  The facade doesn't stand out as it is nestled underneath a hotel.  Nonetheless when entering, the place is modern and has a great atmosphere.    The staff is extremely attentive. The music was a bit eclectic and loud, but I was alone and so I didn't need to worry about holding a conversation.  I ordered the miso soup and a rainbow roll.  Both were good and worth the money.  I gave Kyo only four stars because the seating was cramped."}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive for what it is. I took a chirashi for $19 (plus taxes, came out to about $21), and it was 2 small pieces of tuna, salmon, whitefish, egg, and fake crab and lots of rice and julienned vegetables.  The miso soup was good.. but overall I was kind of disappointed. The atmosphere is nice, the service is great, and if you want sushi that is \"OK\" by Toronto / Vancouver standards, and are OK with paying $19 for some chirashi, then this is a good place to come. to eat.  Personally, I think the quality is on par with those cheap sushi shops. I'm going to buy a box tomorrow for $12.95 and see how it compares."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. We were seated right away. Upscale place. Food ok. They served us spoiled tofu-agedashi tofu. When we alerted the server, he brought it to the chef and they came back to us saying that chef tasted it, and it tasted ok. Now we have eaten tofu for 40 plus years all over the world. I don't think it is supposed to taste sour. I don't think it is right. The reason for reasonable stars is that they did offer to replace with another dish. But just own up to it, save others a bad experience."}
{"text":"Le Kyo nous a reçu pour un événement Élite ce mardi. Nous avons été impressionnés d'abord par la beauté de l'endroit :  bois brut et brique font bon ménage, surtout dans de grands espaces aérés. Bien situé au coin de la rue St-Antoine et de la côte place d'Armes, le Kyo se spécialise en saké, vin de prune, et bouchées d'inspiration japonaises. Les différentes bouchées servies durant l'événement étaient toutes plus délicieuses les unes que les autres.  la morue noire marinée au Miso fut mon coup de cur. Nous avons ensuite décidé de poursuivre notre repas au bar : les sushis étaient excellents et nous avons même eu un petit refill de saké gracieuseté de notre hôtesse ( qui était une serveuse exemplaire soit dit en passant très sympathique). En somme, pour une soirée bien arrosée, remplie d'amour, ambiance loungy et des amuses-gueules délicieux, choisissez le Kyo !  Saké Saké 5$ !"}
{"text":"Very bad experience. I eat there on Monday March 13, 2017 for dinner and developed an allergic reaction. I am just in business trip to Montreal and it really sucks to get sickongoing to the doctor today."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, creative drinks and chic atmosphere make this a must visit! I've visited this restaurant multiple times when in Montreal and it has yet to disappoint. Nice balance of both common and creative dishes. Servers are very helpful and informed when it comes to deciding on what to order and you can't go wrong with the selection of authentic Japanese cuisine and great sushi selection. Don't be afraid to get creative when ordering, you won't regret it. Highly recommend the Hamachi Bibimbap!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food at fair prices. I came here for a quiet dinner as a walk in  with no expectations, and was delighted. I could imagine this place being great for large parties with its fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to this place with friends during the Happening Gourmand. I would recommend the salad for the appetizer. Sushi was of average quality. The crispy rice pudding for dessert was great, but the donut was too sweet."}
{"text":"Great location on old Montreal.  Good drink recs- Best sake I've ever tried  Server was proactive in suggesting vegan alternatives to me Even the miso was great. Ambiance is appropriate for a nice night out/date, Make sure to get reservations in advance"}
{"text":"Service tres long et peu agréable. Les plats sont ok. Le mieux c'est l'emplacement et l'agencement."}
{"text":"one of the worst service in my life.  I applied yelp to write this. i can handle the loud noise and over salty food but the service i got was beyond awful.  didn't even give us a chance to order drinks."}
{"text":"Super friendly maitre-d and waitstaff. Enjoyed the pork belly in lettuce wraps appetizer special, California rolls, chicken skewer, yaki udon with chicken and kimchi. The gaigin and kamikaze rolls were both very good as well. They were very accommodating to my son who only wanted avocado and cucumber rolls that aren't on their regular menu. Two thumbs up! Thanks Yelpers (and the Intercontinental concierge who confirmed for me) that this is the place to go for sushi while in Montreal!"}
{"text":"j'adore ce petit restaurant, il est vraiment très proche de l'endroit ou je travaille. Ils servent les meilleurs sushis dans le Vieux-Port ! De plus, ils ont un service de boite bento qui serve des crevettes tempuras, des légumes panés et des makis . C'est excellent !  Le fait que le restaurant Kyo se situe dans le vieux port est très bien aussi. C'est le genre de restaurant parfait pour aller manger avec des amis avant d'aller prendre un vers dans un des excellents bars du vieux port.  Petite astuce: la suite 701 se trouve dans le même immeuble que ce restaurant. Quoi de mieux en hivers que ne pas devoirs marcher 15 minutes dehors pour se déplacer au bar le plus près."}
{"text":"Certes c'est un peu plus dispendieux que d'autres restaurants à sushis mais ça vaut tout à fait le détour. J'y ai dégusté de délicieux sashimis de pétoncle, saumon bio et soupe miso maison un soir (je conseille de goûter autre chose que les sushis (makis, californiens, il y a meilleur autre part, par contre le reste est très original!).  Je me suis laissé tenté par un chirachi un midi et ai été surpris par la quantité et la qualité du poisson frais servis sur un lit de riz et de crudités fraiches!  Je pense que ça vaut le prix."}
{"text":"We saw all the signs in the metro station and then happened upon this place walking around Montréal. We came back for dinner. This is a very posh restaurant with an extremely welcoming and fun staff! All of the food, sushi, and drinks were out of this world good. The prices were also amazing for the style of dining. I have paid over $200 for two people at a similar style restaurant in NYC this was $160 with a 20% tip included with MORE than enough food to feel like you fed a small country.  I highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Kyo Bar is a very loud bar/drinks place. The drinks selection is extensive. It is a reasonable place to go for after work drinks with a corporate business partner but the sushi is very poor and the prices are quite high. You're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service! The food is very fresh and the menu is varied. We had the two specials and they were both fantastic. Lovely atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Nice trendy decor. Pretty good sushi. I had the rainbow 8 piece roll and the shrimp app. I enjoyed both. Was seated right away and the service was good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Good stuff. service was great. when they are busy they are a bit slow but nothing a bottle of Sake can't compensate for"}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant - I suggest having a reservation. The hostess fit us in and we didn't have a long wait. The concept is tapas and then sushi. You are encouraged to order 2-4 tapas-style items and then order sushi. We ended up getting dumplings, miso soup and edamame. Very good soup. They have several cocktails. I didn't like the Bruce Li but did like my friend's drink with cranberry and wine. The sushi was really good. So fresh tasting. I liked how they used cucumber instead of rice to hold it together. We ended up splitting a bread pudding with a matcha sauce for dessert. So good. Our waiter was nice. Service was a bit slow but it was crowded in there. A little hard to hear due to all the noise from other diners and the music blaring. Prices were in line with most restaurants in the area. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great fun ambiance with live DJ. Awesome appetizers personally I think are better than the other popular izakaya like Kinka or Imadake."}
{"text":"Love that place. Went twice and would go back any time. Very good Sake selection, the Snake sushis and spinach salad are delicious. We also had fried chicken and sashimis. It's not the usual Izakaya, think more classy a bit. With less noise."}
{"text":"Decent service. Good atmosphere. We are from Vancouver and sushi is big there, so comparing to the value and quality of sushi/sashimi in Vancouver, this place is WAY over priced! Not going back unless we don't find another place with the same quality at a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is never too busy so you get seated right away! The food tastes great! It's clean! And their staffs are nice. This is Japanese restaurant but run by all Caucasians. So it's kind of awkward to see the waiters or waitresses having trouble reading the menu when it's Japanese. The foods they serve is sushi but it's not that nice compare to other Japanese restaurants in mtl. One time the smell is sashimi was too strong (not good fish). But then it's hard to find good Japanese restaurants in mtl so this place is not that bad. Their hot plates are typical dishes served in most of all Japanese restaurants. One bad experience I have every single time is... the drink I order is always out of stock.. so I always pick two drinks as my back up. Overall, I give 5 bc no waiting time, not too expensive and still get to eat Japanese food."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic lunch! We had the bento box with a side of maki. Sushi was great but the real show stoppers were the salad and the teriyaki which is a tough meal to distinguish greatness. The pièce de résistance was the surprise donuts dessert with condensed milk and raspberries. Overall a truly fabulous meal. Cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"Incredible staff. Thoughtful decor. Soft floor. Best cod and tuna in Montreal. Buttery fresh sashimi. For non fish, strongly recommend the karagge chicken."}
{"text":"Mediocre experience. Food was good and average Hot dishes were not hot... Gyoza was cold. Service was attentive and yet not that effective- food came before our first cocktail even though we ordered drinks earlier in the evening. This place has potential but needs to work on timing how and when food is served."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for Taste Mtl and at first I got a good impression because the ambiance was very fun. There was upbeat music (from my middle/high school years), and we were seated in front of the bar which was a great view. I liked the lighting, the furniture etc. But then when it came to ordering food, the service was really slow and inconsistent. My 3 friends got their soy glazed maple chicken appetizer but the rest of us had to wait another 10-15 minutes for our appetizer, which was tataki. I thought that was not well planned, giving some our friends food while the rest of us had to wait. It's just not a good \"flow\" of service I guess. Same with the dessert. I got my dessert first and then the rest had to wait for their yuzu donuts.  I have to say the main dish was mediocre, but the appetizers and dessert were pretty solid, The chicken wings, man, delicious! The salmon tataki was yummy and juicy as well. But the main dish, hmm...nothing special? The dessert was a wow! I had chocolate green tea bread pudding...it was something I never tasted before in my life. The waiter drizzled green tea sauce all over it. I wish I could have finished it, but alas I was so full I gave it to my boyfriend to finish. It kind of looked like salad from afar, but it's a very unique dessert I have to say.   I give this place 3 stars because the service was not consistent in terms of pacing and also the main dish was not up to par with the appetizers and dessert. I wouldn't mind visiting again for drinks and a small bite though."}
{"text":"only went here because i was pressed for time and it was closed to home. beef kalbi was too salty, chicken yakitori was too fatty and tasted like too much ginger, pork belly was bland and flavorless and the roll i had had too much rice. won't be going back here again. also, service was slow. came here at 5pm when they just opened and took us 20 minutes to get served when there were only two tables."}
{"text":"Just walking distance to the palais des congrès. I went there to get some good Japanese food. I expected excellent sashimi and sushi.   I ordered the spinach salad as the entree and the chef sashimi California roll platter for dinner.   It was good but only good. With the price, I was expecting something more thoughtru.   I am sorry I personally will not go again because too overpriced for an ''OK'' sashimi.     They are better places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I visited Kyo on my first trip to Montreal a couple weekends ago. In a city where I expected to enjoy French and Canadian food the most, Kyo stood out among all the restaurants we tried during our visit.  The service was great and so was the ambiance. I loved everything we tried, even the dishes we ordered that I was initially on the fence about but tried on a whim. The Kyo maki roll for example, which has strawberry and lychee along with crab and tuna, turned out to be my absolute favorite. We almost ordered another despite being stuffed. Finished off the night with fresh donuts paired with yuzu sauce. I would go back just for that roll and that dessert!"}
{"text":"The decor is very nice and the service was good. The sushi combination lunch special is a good value for the quality. The sushi rice was good and the fish is very fresh. The maki was a rainbow type roll which was nicely done. They also have a nice menu of other items."}
{"text":"J'avais probablement beaucoup trop d'attente sur ce restaurant, mais j'ai trouvé mon repas bon, mais sans plus. J'y suis allée pour souper dans le cadre de Montréal à table, je vais probablement devoir y retourner pour me faire une meilleure idée.  Mon highlight de la soirée a été mon drink et le beignet au citron que mon conjoint a pris comme dessert. Mon conjoint a particulièrement apprécié l'habillement des serveuses ;)"}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I have gone to this restaurant on a number of different occasions. It's become our restaurant of choice when we have something to celebrate. The ambiance is inviting - modern, cozy and low lit.   Japanese food happens to be my favourite type of cuisine and this place does not disappoint. We always order the Grilled black cod marinated in white miso and sake every time we go. It's perfectly crispy on the outside and the white fish is soft and buttery inside.   I would avoid the oysters. I think they are fresh but they are served with some bubbly sauce on top and I did not like that.   The sushi makis are very fresh and inspired. If you want vegetarian makis it's not on the menu but the chef will make something special for you upon request.   This place is popular. The last time we went they were fully booked so we sat at the bar and realized it's a great spot to be if you're two. The bar stools were comfortable and we had plenty of counter space for all our various plates."}
{"text":"The udon kimchi bowl may be able to conquer small villages on its own. Amazing. Great service. Always a must when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I saw lots of good comments of this restaurant so when i am around I decide to try this one.   2 stars are for the environment. 0 for food and service.  The menu is so simply,  you can not find too much options to order, other Japanese restaurants have much more foods. :)  So let's talk about the food. The salad was very small and only have very few sashimi in it, totally overpriced. The maki is ok. But just ok and no more. The yaki udon is a big disaster! Too salty and sour even cannot find any sashimi in it maybe they are tooooo small for me to find?   We waited for an hour for 2 yaki udons at 8 pm which means not too much people in the restaurant so I cannot figure out why it takes too long to make 2 noodles.   To sum up. I will never go to this place again. And if you wanna enjoy real and delicious Japanese food, DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"We had the mixed sashimi platter it was very good. But the salmon sashimi  la carte was amazing. $6 for three huge pieces of salmon slices was the best salmon I ever ate. My family all agreed. We don't get this quality salmon in NY(almost as good). If you ever tried Toro and compare it to Maguro, then you now what I'm talking about.The salmon here tastyed like Fatty tuna but as a salmon. You can actually see the fatty lines in the salmon that you normally don't see elsewhere.It melted in my mouth so we ended up ordering 7 more orders of this salmon. Is it this restaurant or is it the canadian salmon? I was told that canadian salmon was very good compared to the one from the states but I can't be sure.How can salmon taste so good, so fatty, so melt in your mouth good!!! I gave this restaurant 4 stars but the salmon put it over into stratosphere 5 stars. For a place designed as a Japanes style drinking joint, this place has great decor and modern ambiance. The food is surprisingly excellent. Salmon is a must eat item here."}
{"text":"I visited Kyo for Happening Gourmand for their 3 course dinner for $25. I had the Beef Sashimi to start, sashimi bowl, and donut! The food was great for the price! The plating, and presentation of the food was beautiful. The taste is ok! (It's hard to give Japanese food a high rating after living in Vancouver!!) I would definitely return to try their regular menu sometime!  Food -  Good Service - Ok Ambiance - Dark / Romantic / Quiet Worth the money - Yes!"}
{"text":"Began with accommodating service - arrived w/o reservations; fabulous cocktails followed by plate after delicious plate, tapas style for our party of four: shrimp tempura, jumbo shrimp with wasabi mayo, rainbow roll and more. So. Very. Delicious. We loved Eder (our wonderful server)!"}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance, attentive service, delicious food. The music is great and Clara at the bar can make a fun spin on the Old Fashion. A must-do if you're looking for quality Japanese at a good price. Large tables and great energy."}
{"text":"Really good. The sercice; food quality, ambience... everything was ."}
{"text":"The Jumbo shrimp dish was amaaaaaazing. Kamikaze rolls too... I really loved everything we ordered, and we ordered a lot.  Service was quick and attentive too - great drinks. Didn't love the communal table (I take issue with these) but it was fine.  We got 10% off since we were staying at the hotel, and any percent off makes me happy.   Will definitely return on my next trip to MTL."}
{"text":"I ordered 10 pc of sashimi for 23$. It was ok overall. Definitely not as good as the ones I tasted in Japan. The waiter was also pretty slow to take the bill and fill out empty water cups.   My friend ordered the table d'hôte with salmon. It was ok but the portion was small. We ended up going to Chinatown after dinner to grab some snacks.   We felt Kyo is not up to my expectations to match its price. I prefer Nozy if I wanna some good quality sashimi. Probably won't come back for a second time."}
{"text":"We had a nice meal at Kyo.  All of the food was tasty, though I might avoid the incredibly chewy beef tongue next time.  The good certainly outweighed the bad, but it's worth describing the entire experience.  The first bad thing would be the chairs.  My chair was filthy and they replaced it with a stained chair.  Seriously, someone turn on the lights and look at the chairs.  But once we got past that, things improved.  The wine selection is expensive, we got one that I'd never tried before and while neither of us loved it, it wasn't bad.  Next time I might stick with something I knew better.  The food is basically tapas so we tried different things.  The beef tongue was chewy but the taste was nice.  The pork belly was really good.  The portions of omakase sashimi were small but the fish was very fresh.  The rainbow roll was nice but there was a sauce inside that was better off hidden behind wasabi & soy.  The gyoza were very good, as were the tempura.  And the negihama roll was exactly what I expected but it was small.  We had a good filling meal that improved as the night went on and for the two of us it was $150 plus tip.  Service was terrific.  Our server Guillaume successfully managed to be both professional and warm at the same time, and I'm glad he was our server.  For me, Kyo tries a little too hard to be hip and trendy but it's probably something that works well for them.  And let's face it, the young who seem to gravitate toward the kind of music played there and the dim lighting probably spend more money in restaurants than I do.  But the bottom line is that we left with full stomachs and big smiles.  I'd go back, I'd go when I could sit by a window before dark to have a little more light, and I'd look at those chairs before I sat in one!"}
{"text":"Patrick was a wonderful host steering us to all the right menu items, both food and beverage. He really opened our eyes to sake. We tried three different varieties and really appreciate his guidance.  The rooms were great too. Their signature Kyo roll was great. The kamikaze, and snake were great too.   Back for lunch and tried the bibimbop. That was awesome too with a generous portion of butterfish."}
{"text":"Staying at the hotel, figured my wife and I would get a quick drink before heading out to dinner, we ate here on a previous trip and enjoyed it.    We arrived just after opening so were the first folks there, sat at the bar.  The bartender was great (sorry, forgot your name...remember you were the local artist who also draws the chalkboard each night), we had her recommend drinks and she didn't disappoint.   My wife had this raspberry drink that was very yummy, I had the Ninja, (two actually), based on her request.  It was excellent, and I had her made the second one more spicy then the first but it tastes almost like watermelon but with a nice spicy kick at the end.  Yum!   We'll stop in and have dinner next time we are in town"}
{"text":"All of the food was really great. Surprisingly, the chicken wings were one of my favorites. Sushi was nothing to brag anout but there other dishes were all very good. Sake sampler was good and dessert donuts were great!"}
{"text":"Back again for the 5th time and service and food are great ! Eisa rocks the bar and the sake is amazing !! As are the spicy scallops !!  I'll be back ! Again"}
{"text":"If you are a young scrappy student like me, let me tell you: this place is expensive. But if you want to impress a date, and like extremely good food, this is the place to go. Music is good, sushi are made by God's son himself, presentation is nice, I literately cannot complain. Have some fun."}
{"text":"Lovely place, fabulous sushi and great service.  We went with a group of coworkers and the place was very enjoyable. We ordered many different rolls to share and in addition to all the classic options they had a really nice selection of interesting rolls. Some wrapped in cucumber, and eel one that was delicious and I think it was called dragon the other one I loved. All came with interesting sauces and were nicely prepared and had the right ratio of fish to veggies and rice.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I arrived early (around 5:10 pm) on a Thursday and sat at the bar. The bartender/server was great. Very friendly and helpful.   The major negative was seeing the supervisor/manager calling out the bus-boy for not having glasses set up properly on the pre-set tables. If you're going to grill your staff, at least do it in privacy and not in front of customers.   The udon was good - not great - a little on the bland side. The nigiri was quite good, though. Overall a little overpriced - but it is located in tourist-trap-central.   Overall - not a great experience.  Service: 5 stars Food I had: 3 stars Atmosphere: 0 stars"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my dining experience at Kyo. After reading the other reviews on yelp, I has expected really great sashimi but what we got was less than fresh, especially considering we ordered the omakase.  The fish was mushy and not what I had seen in previous pictures.    The rest of the meal was just okay.  We ordered the tuna sashimi appetizer and the tuna was overcooked, the beef skewers were acceptable, and the signature beef roll was not bad but none of which you would be heartbroken to miss.  That being said, our server was super nice and the overall service was good. The ambience was also cute.  I say....skip it!"}
{"text":"I had the shogun maki rolls! Best sushi I've had in a really long time! What amazing customer service! We're staying at the hotel and I'm coming back every night lol"}
{"text":"Had the jumbo shrimp dish, which was AMAZING! Then I also had the snake-roll, which was delicious. My overall impression is great, and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"We went there for the TasteMtl event, as a good opportunity to try out a different japanese restaurant in our neighborhood.  Okonomiyaki: a must! I completely fell in love with this dish, as it is a delicious version of the ones I tried in Japan a month ago. Nice not too battery filled with seafood!  Other than that, it is expensive for what got, if it wasn't for the special event prices. Seems that the restaurant special rolls might have worth the trip, as the ordinary one like Kamikaze and Hamachi was pretty ordinary rolls (almost like what you can find in all-you can eat sushi) for 7$ each!  The restaurant was good, but nothing outstanding from other sushi restaurants that will make me come back again except for that Okonomiyaki."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers, believe the hype, Japanese food is not at its best at Kyo (which in English means today). Not only the food was a meh, the staff was also inattentive- I had to stop a waiter for water after sitting down for quite some time.  Opted for the bibimbap with marinated hamachi fish, egg and kimchi (the menu read \"vegetables\"). It came only tepid. I wouldn't mind if there's not a raw yolk in the center.. Haru sushi, a combination roll of tuna, salmon, albacore, kanikama (imitation crab stick), tobiko, rolled with cucumber, was flooded in sauce. But hey in the restaurant's justice, who cares whether the sashimi was fishy and the sauce was way salty after wolfing down much alcohol. It's a bar after all.   The service was very slow - considering the bar was only half full, can you imagine waiting 20 plus mins for your one starter and 55 mins for your entree? And the waitress (aka. bartender) was very impatient when I asked her to check on my entree and that showed on her face. Viola... Another 20 minutes flipped by after she told me that my dish \"was on the way.\" haha, I blamed myself for not trusting more the previous Yelp ranking. :("}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant ! If you love sushi and your in old Montreal make sure to stop by and get a bite. Nice elegant atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal from San Francisco and found this place near my hotel. I wasn't sure what to think of sushi in Montreal but this place did not disappoint. I ordered the Kyo roll that came with crab, avocado, takuan, lychee, tuna, spicy mayo, and strawberry.   When the waitress suggested this I was like \"what the hell?\"  Never heard of strawberry in a roll before. However I decided to give it a try. I was glad I did, every bite was an explosion of flavor. One minute I felt the crunch of the radish, then the softness of the crab, then all the sudden you bite into the lychee and you get a splash of juice. It was quite an experience.   The waitress was also very sweet and thoughtful. She gave suggestions on places to see and go. Also talked for a bit about the food culture in Montreal. I was very impressed with how educated she was about the food scene in Montreal. Great spot for a foodie, also the donut dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"Before we were seated, I was thinking about how I'd have to dock stars from their rating due to our experience. We got there at 9PM on a Saturday night without a reservation, so we were kind of asking for it - but, the hostess & manager were not exactly attentive (or kind) we had to remind them 3 times that we were a group of 3 and no one approached us yet. Finally, after 25 minutes of standing by the door, the manager said there'd be a 45 minute wait for us to even sit at the bar. Luckily, there was a bar upstairs so we killed some time there. However, we still weren't sat until about 11PM...so much for 45 minutes, right?   Aaaaanyway...the experience flipped around once we were finally seated. Our waiter Patrick was awesome. He took our order immediately and our drinks came shortly after.   The food took a while, so Patrick came by with cherry sake bombs as a token of appreciation for our patience. They were really fun to do & tasted delicious! Thank you Patrick!   We ordered the beef tartare as an appetizer and it was mouthwatering. The sushi and sashimi was also to die for; it may be among the top 3 sushi places I've ever been to.   The night ended with Patrick giving us a list of local bar/club recommendations since he knew we were tourists. :)   TL/DR: don't come without a reservation if you don't want to wait forever. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"Kyo sets you up for a thrill with a sexy decor and a formidable menu but it was bit of a let down. The food was at about the same level your average neiborhood Sushi restaurant. Everything we ate was mostly just ok. One really good offering though was the fried skate wing ;quite crispy, lighly battered and succulent when dipped in ponzu. There were lots of interesting cocktails offered but  two we picked were like the food just ok. A big turn off was the service...too many people running orders from the sushi bar and kitchen acting like waiters. We had at least five different people bring food out to the table and  then asking for additional orders.  They were all nice and well intentioned, but ,made the dining experience seem quite chaotic, Kyo has  a tempting desert menu and like eveything else it was just ok. So unless the've made some big changes in last few weeks I recommend that  you spend your more than 100 bucks per person elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place for a date night.  Ordered sashimi salad, beef carpaccio, tempura & Hamachi bibimbap.  Waiter was friendly, great fusion food and chic decor.  Friday night DJ played nice chill out music.    Mostly couples or ladies night, not suitable for family with young kids."}
{"text":"Vegetarian friendly even though the online menu suggests otherwise. The miso soup and salad were great. I had the avocado roll, the vegan roll, and a third one (also vegetarian... can't remember).  Service was great. My only issue was that it was a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Un premier rendez vous en tête  dans ce resto  et  jai toute suite adoré  le personel  et l'ambiance.  Jai eu la chance de goûter  à la morue  qui fond litéralement dans la bouche . Les dumpling de porc sont grillés à point avec une petite sauce qui est divine . Le tataki de thon  ses piments forts  et oignons un succès  dans la bouche et que dire des sashimi de boeuf avec ses gousses d'ail frit un mélange qui ne peut pas être un succès . Pour termimer les  ailes de poulet sont originals et sucrés  à point ."}
{"text":"Super chill and trendy vibe. Great date night spot.   We came for the sushi and ordered the Chefs choice nigiri as well as some rolls. I really enjoyed the different types of fish that came with the Chefs choice. It is definitely not what I usually order but was a nice change. The options for sushi seemed like less than usual, but I think it's just the way they do things. The menu is really meant to be shared.   Also liked the Suika pop drink. Ice popsicle in prosecco, yes please!-- but a bit pricey at $18. Is this NYC?   I would probably come back, my friend wasn't as into it as I was though."}
{"text":"A great place for Japanese food. As good, if not better, than any we've tasted elsewhere. Seaweed and eggplant salads were delicious. The sushi special was spicy scallop and vegetables wrapped in soya leaf - it was delicious. Service was friendly. A wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the tables are very close to each other so it's not very private. Food was good. Tapas-style Japanese/Korean plates were good. Somewhat limited selection sushi selection. Fun, loud atmosphere. The short ribs were delicious. The pinky ginger cocktail was tasty but a little weak. Straight liquor was a pretty short pour."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the food here. I had the tuna takiti (I believe is the name) and the snake sushi roll. I loved both. Both felt fresh. The tuna takiti's marinade was excellent and refreshing. We also had the endamame which had large chunks of sea salt on it which was perfect. To end I had the donut dessert served with condensed milk and sesame seeds. The taste was citrusy and original. Over all good food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tellement une belle découverte! Je suis enchantée et je suis seulement allée pour dîner, imagine l'expérience du souper !! Il y a un menu varié qui offre la possibilité de commander soit des sushis à l'unité, des boîtes bento (le boeuf, MIAM) qui contiennent sushis, viande au choix, crevettes tempura, légumes tempura et petites salades, des assiettes tempura, des salades diverses, et tous les plats viennent avec soupe ou salade (la soupe miso est délicieuse!!) ! Et le prix est vraiment intéressant pour la qualité des plats ! Une place que je vous conseille grandement si vous trippez style Isakaya !! En plus, à l'intérieur, c'est vraiment beau !!!"}
{"text":"This certainly is one of the talks of town. It's always busy. I had great sushi rolls. Service was really nice. I certainly will be back for more. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a great atmosphere, service and of course good sushi."}
{"text":"I came to Kyo bar with a friend last week for the happening gourmand table d'hote. I wasn't impressed with the food but I have to say the service was excellent.  We started with the beef sashimi which was pretty disappointing. The meat was a bit chewy and not as tender as I like my sashimi to be. The agadeshi tofu was okay but it came with a sauce that was ridiculously salty.  Thankfully the main meal was much better than the appetizers. The chirashizushy was  interesting, it was like eating a huge bowl of sushis. Although the mix of  rice, sashimi and veggies was good at first I got tired of it towards the middle and couldn't finish it. I think it would have been better as an appetizer.   For the desert, we had the yuzu donuts with  condensed milk. My donuts were cold which kind of spoiled the desert to me. I really liked the taste of yuzu though.   Overall, it was okay I would maybe come back to try some other items in the menu. Maybe the regular menu is better than the happening gourmand one."}
{"text":"I had two of the daily specials: shima aju (stripe jack) and uchiwahagi (file fish). I also had maguro (tuna) and a California roll. All the fish tasted average, but I really do like this place experimenting with types of fish that are not commonly available outside of Japan."}
{"text":"Très bon, très cher ! Et le meilleur pour la fin, plutôt original. Du rôti de buf dans un sushi, ça change et ça régale les papilles.  Par contre, les nigri à la pièce sont trop dispendieux, il faut prendre une sélection du chef mais sans pouvoir choisir ce qu'on met dedans, c'est dommage. Bonus : pas trop de bruit de fond  Bémol : les desserts n'étaient pas du tout inspirants ..."}
{"text":"I happened on this restaurant during Happening Gourmand and it was a true find. Attached to Hotel Place d'Armes and fantastic sushi and izakaya cuisine. Our server Vivienne was phenomenal and we tried the Kyo roll which was to die for. Location, food, service- I thought  5 stars all around. The donuts also don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very nice. I tried the kyro roll which was fresh. The service left much to be desired though. I felt a bit rushed even though the place was half empty on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Upscale Japanese joint in the old Montreal sounds already attractive, but Happening Gourmand is what brought me there in the end.    The restaurant was bustling with clients, service was yet prompt and polite. The food from the table d'hôte menu was fine, but nothing special. I expected bigger pieces of fish in my scattered sushi dish, catching the small cuts of food with chop sticks is somehow fun, but a lot of work too. The sushi rice was sweeter then what I would prefer. The sushi rolls were also just Ok. I really enjoyed the yuzu donuts desert. Most of everything I liked the sake tasting flight that consists of four different types of sake, nicely presented and explained by our host (wish I could remember the details). I would definitely return to Kyo for a drink or two, as the name suggests this is a Japanese bar that has nice food for snack with your cocktail."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was amazing. Jean-Francois was great and provided us with a recommendation to go with a chef created menu and we had a really good time trying out all the dishes"}
{"text":"Two stars only for their service, not the food. I went there with my boyfriend, for celebrating his birthday. We ordered chef's choice sushi, sashimi, and tempura mixed. The fish just tastes meh... and the tempura OMG...they put too much tempura flour on the shrimps, and the shrimps are really small.   Unfortunately, I won't go there again, and will not recommend to any of my friends. But the service is really good, high-class, 5-star service."}
{"text":"This was quite a strange experience and calling it \"Japanese\" is more than a stretch.  Its a cross between an Asian place pretending to be Japanese and a nightclub (and the music doesnt match what you would expect to hear at a sushi place....even if it was more night-clubby).   The food was subpar as well, including the freshness of the sashimi and sushi which is REALLY IMPORTANT.  Now, this isnt nearly as bad as the \"Japanese\" place that is located around a 3 minute walk from this place (...people can guess where that is) but having two lame Japanese places so close to each other-- thats just not right."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance in here even though my young friend had to use their lantern to help her see the menu a bit better. the bartender created a drink just for her because she was feeling like lychee and so she got a delicious lychee lemonade with vodka to make it non-virgin. the apps we got were delicious too. we got chicken wings that were flavorful. the beef tataki was done well with crispy fried onions to add texture. the tuna tataki had a nice flavor and quite good. the sushi rolls were creative, we wish there were more options but we were very happy with the three rolls we got. there was a naruto roll with three types of fish in it that i loved loved love! it was also a walk from our hotel and we went to suite 701 for more drinks after which was very good and within the same building!"}
{"text":"I am visiting my sister in Montreal and we decided to eat at Kyo tonight as we are both big sushi fans.  The restaurant was in a great location and the decor and music created a cool vibe.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  I was feeling rather hungry so we ordered a lot: miso soup, gyoza dumplings, agedashi tofu, moriawase tempura, nagoya chicken wings, and the eight piece nagiri. We also ordered three maki rolls: Califonia, Kamikaze, and Kyo.  Highlights of the meal were the maki rolls and the chicken wings.  The Kyo roll was especially interesting - it included lychee and strawberry - neither of which I had never had in a roll before. The flavors worked well though, with the strawberry providing a sweet taste and the lychee giving it a unique texture.  The nagoya chicken wings were also delicious - tender meat covered in a tasty sweet sauce. I would definitely recommend both dishes.  Unfortunately, some dishes were disappointing.  The gyoza dumplings were nothing special and the agedashi tofu was rather bland - neither the tofu cube or the hot tenstuyu broth offered much flavor.  All in all though, the meal was enjoyable and the restaurant/service were great.  I would recommend Kyo if you are in Montreal and looking for a good sushi experience."}
{"text":"The fish/food we got was very good.  It was fresh and tasted good.  The portion size was okay and the prices were decent, although a tad on the high side.  We had yellowtail, salmon, unagi, a mushroom skewer appetizer, cucumber salad, and 3 specialty rolls which were all pretty unique and delicious.  It's always so sad to me to have to rate a restaurant with low stars when the food is good.  But I guess service is really an integral part of the overall dining experience and staff can really make or break a review.  Our waitress was off-putting from the moment she sat us. She had quite an attitude and told us that we were not allowed to talk to the sushi chef which is a bit weird when you are sitting at the sushi bar.  She also took our menus after we placed our initial order even though we told her that we would be ordering more and then gave us a huge sigh and huffed off to get the menu again when we told her we wanted to order more, but needed to look at the menu again.  Sorry...we didn't study and memorize it for your convenience.  Geeze.  And even though we were dining early and the restaurant was not very busy, she was more interested in talking to her co-worker than in coming by to check to see if we needed anything.    The sushi chef ended up striking up a convo with us and even though he had very broken English, he was a delightful person and made us feel at home.   Had it not been for him and his assistant, who made every plate we were served a beautiful piece of art, the overall stars would have been even lower.  So, to sum up: Food - solid 4 stars Service (with the exception of the sushi chef and his asst) - 1 star, maybe"}
{"text":"Dé-li-cieux ! Je recommande vivement, la qualité du poisson est exceptionnelle et le rapport qualité-prix est très correct. Toujours bien accueilli et servi, une très bonne adresse."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday evening. The environment is low key chill, with a trendy vibe. We had many different dishes and each one was excellent. The dish that sticks out the most was the Haru. Sushi wrapped in cucumber. Loved it and will want to try this type of roll again. Will definitely come back when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"There are lots of places you can go in the old city for French or Canadian food but you can only have so much steak fritter. But eventually a lighter fare seems appealing and what better than sushi and other Japanese bites. Kyo serves up Japanese with a gourmet touch. The room is inviting with the opportunity to eat inside or al fresco. The service was great and we enjoyed learning a bit about life in Montreal from our server. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great decor, ambiance, and service!  The food was excellent, but the portions were way too small for the price. $13 gets you a 5 piece sushi roll instead of the standard 8-9, and these weren't 5 large pieces either.  We ordered 3 rolls whose names escape me, but all 3 were scrumptious. There was a strawberry and lychee roll that was particularly savory.  If I wanted a VERY light meal and some drinks with girlfriends, I would return. But for dinner? Probably not."}
{"text":"Was there with my wife and a friend, we were there for dinner and a some drink. We had some great fresh sashimi, sushi and their hot dish are stunning!  There are many sushi place out there but this place turns your sushi into art. It's so beautiful that makes you want to look it a longer period before tasting it. See pictures yourself!"}
{"text":"Stoped here while strolling by Norte Dame de Montreal. Great service and delicious food! So glad we came here for dinner. We had a snake roll and a sashimi salad. All fish was grease and delicious, and did I mention that the service was great?! Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Expensive restaurant   I ordered Bibimbap with one Pinte of Sapporo. The price I paid for the size is not worth unfortunately. It's very good environment. If you want to get full, you have to spend close to 80$ per person.   The size of their Bibimbap is close to the bowl size of a soup you get in chinese restaurant.   Overall I give 2 stars just for the environment."}
{"text":"Nous nous y sommes rendus avec des amis dans le cadre de Montréal à table. J'avais probablement trop d'attentes sur ce restaurant vu les avis. En tout cas j'espère que les propositions du chef y sont différentes en temps normal car nous avons été déçu et restons sur une mauvaise impression. Les plats manquent de saveurs, peu voire pas de goût. Aucune surprise. Les cocktails si, eux, étaient bons et surprenants. Bref, le prix, élevé, n'est par conséquent pas justifié! J'y retournerai quand même une fois en dehors de cet évènement pour confirmer ou non ma première impression."}
{"text":"There for lunch.  Not bad.  Not brilliant.  Sushi average.  Salmon in bento was a bit dry, and tea oddly not hot.    A lot of potential.  Would try again, but only if super convenient."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here. We had to dine early in order to catch a walking tour afterwards so started at 6pm. Our server was lovely and guided my less sushi loving colleagues to dishes they could handle. I filled my belly with the snake roll, salmon sashimi and the sake flight. The fish was very fresh. We also had the fried shrimp and an order of edamame. Delicious! Everyone left full and happy."}
{"text":"I had a sampling at Kyo Bar Japonais tonight and everything was fantastic!!!  YOU HAVE TO TRY THE SHRIMP. Holy Sake, you have to try it. ;-) You get 5 for $14, but do not underestimate the shear size of these shrimp. They are meaty!!!   The Cod was amazing, warmed up to perfection. The doughnut was so good!   I don't know what they call it, but I tried these chicken pieces on a skewer. They were glazed with a tasty sauce and topped with sesame seeds = AMAZZZING.   I then tried sushi with crab inside and a sweet slice of strawberry-love on top. It too was heavenly.   I intend to go back soon with my Fiance who no doubt will love it. The decor is truly Japanese and it a lovely restaurant. Very romantic, not too big, but also not too small.   I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal, and certainly my favourite sushi restaurant (I've been here 4-5 times). It's in a quaint corner spot in Old Montreal, and service is always friendly, fast, and helpful. The sushi is of the modern style, so don't expect much in the way of classics (although they do that the standard california roll, spicy tuna, etc.). They also have interesting choices like the Snake (not made with real snake), and the beef sashimi (made with real raw beef). They also have an outstanding choice of sake, and a sake tasting menu as well. Great food, great service, great place!"}
{"text":"Simply the largest Sake selection in town. The service is really professional and it is a pleasure to be able to discover this universe here in MTL.  The food is good and the place cosy. The decoration and/or the music could had been more original.  I definitely recommend the place for any curious."}
{"text":"Such charming and attentive service. Light, bright tastes (spinach in sesame broth, Temptation roll, sashimi salad, dumplings, spicy chicken)... fantastic local wines and cocktails. Right across from the Notre Dame Basilic. Convenient and a new favorite."}
{"text":"Best salmon sashimi I ever had, I reccomend the Kamikazi Rolls as well, very niiice I actually ordered another roll of it when Iwas done with my food (sushi sometimes just isnt filling enough) to fill two good eaters it costed just under 100 dollars (including drinks)  Waitstaff was VERY helpful. I ordered a Suzuki Sling and my waitress showed me the proper way to serve the drink (a mix it your self hot sake drink.) She was so nice and was totally okay with getting USD tips (all we had in cash)   The sashimi plate (10 pieces) was said to also be very good.   Bathrooms were clean and being downstairs was nice to get away from all the noise for a moment.  Sushi bar was pleasant (the place gets really packed, get a reservation just in case, we lucked out this time) the place is a bit small and has outdoor seating, the small space is fine when your sitting down but trying to leave is a puzzle.   Took a bit to get our check but like I said, the place was packed to capacity and then some. Multitasking was an understatement for our waitress.  I would 100% go back, and would be dissapointed if I missed the chance to go back to this resturant next time I visit Montreal.  Food 10/10 Waitstaff 8.5/10 Atmosphere 8/10 (dark, loud and cramped.... cute though) Price yikes"}
{"text":"Good location close to Chinatown, Old Port and Palais des Congrès. A few minutes walk from the Champ-de-Mars Metro Station.  Barman and barmaid are friendly. We enjoyed the special cocktail drinks. I had the Ninja cocktail which has a spicy kick : you should order that one.  The appetizers were average, but the ambiance is good. It has a good vibe."}
{"text":"good place good atmosphere and creative menu it is trendy but wish the food was more authentic you see all white people so in order to get that sophisticated asian crowd need to work harder"}
{"text":"Great restaurant food and service top notch. Our waiter Guilliame very attentive. Recommended if your are in the area"}
{"text":"Love this place. Had my birthday dinner there and would back there for a date night.   Great design. Friendly staff. Great tunes on Saturdays at least.   Food was great and the drinks as well."}
{"text":"First, the good things: the service was great even if I was getting the Happening Gourmand special to go, the atmosphere/decor was nice enough that I noticed it, and the dessert was good.  I had the tonkatsu with salad. The salad was mostly iceberg with a tiny bit of wakame, which for a $15 (+tax +tip) lunch is ridiculous. The sesame dressing was good.  The tonkatsu was oily, to the point where I couldn't finish it and that was despite being starving and wanting tonkatsu really badly. They didn't give me any rice and the \"Japanese coleslaw\" listed on the menu was two slices of pickled daikon with a tiny mound of grated cabbage.  I've had better tonkatsu in a convenience store. (In Tokyo, yes, but still.)  I didn't try any sushi, but based on this experience, I'm not going to go back unless it's for a drink."}
{"text":"Kyo introduces Montreal to the Izakaya Bar style of Japanese food - which consists of a variety of small dishes and snacks served with interesting cocktails.   They have sushi option, but don't come here thinking it's a specialize sushi restaurant. Kyo focuses on small Japanese tapas style food. Everything on the menu is very good, including the desserts. The location is also very hip. Nevertheless, Kyo is lacking in service as their inexperienced waiting does not meet expectations."}
{"text":"Service was excellent: My server Camille was very pleasant and patient explaining the menu and making recommendations.  Items are served tapas style to share. The pork belly was very flavorful, and the drinks were good. As I mentioned the portion size is tapas style so at $12-$15 a small plate does add up. I would come here for drinks as the atmosphere is nice, and maybe a small plate but not for dinner. It was very pricey for what it was.  Server Camille was so nice! I asked her for a recommendation for a cafe and she wrote down some of her favorite cafes. Thank you Camille!"}
{"text":"Tres beaux local et jolie decoration tamisée, cachet et tout mais les saveurs des nos assietes standard pas de surprise ... pas bon marché non plus."}
{"text":"We happened to notice Kyo while driving by on a recent trip to Montreal. Holy Moly are we glad we did... The restaurant had only been open a few days, but you wouldn't have known it. Rare indeed for a \"soft\" opening...  The wait staff were awesome, especially Genevieve. She suggested we simply relax and order a chef's choice sampler, which consisted of assorted apps and entrees: Japanese noodle favorites, Asian shortribs, sauteed veggies, and some really awesome sushi, both rolls and sashimi. Who would have thought you could get great sushi in Montreal?? Oh yes, you can  The fish was extremely fresh, very flavorful, and had some nice chef-style touches added. I especially liked how they used tobiko and roe... yummy  Prices are a bit high (blame us tourists) but the place is new, tastefully designed, and top notch  Go here... vien ici!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab drinks and sushi before a night out! I went with a group of five and we were promptly seated (I'd suggest making a reservation as they were quite busy Saturday night). As it was a birthday dinner, we ordered sushi for the table and each of us had one or two cocktails.  The Ninja Cocktail was spicy and unique in taste, which is something I appreciate in cocktails. I would highly suggest picking a cocktail to compliment your sushi order. The cocktails were priced $10-16CAN which, for a traveling American, was a great price for such a quality cocktail. The sushi itself was also well priced and we all left extremely happy! I would definitely recommend Kyo Bar if you're looking for an intimate yet trendy ambiance and if you're in the mood to be adventurous with drinks and sushi!"}
{"text":"Great location so I guess that explains the prices. Service was good and the ambiance is dark and comfortable. We arrived at 6:00 as we were going to Aura at 8:00. It got lively quickly. We had various 5 and 8 piece rolls which were good- not great. We also ordered edamame, wings and dumplings. Very small portions -and then when you get the bill- wow!  No one left full or even close to a feeling like we had eaten.  Prices are just over the top for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and actual japanese sushi chefs. My buddy and I walked in on a saturday night and we were lucky enough to snag one of the last seats in the place.   We ordered a very tasty okinomiyaki (fish pancake), gyoza, tasty unagi (eel) rolls and more! Our waitress recommended an excellent   moderately priced sake. The tuna was fresh and tasty! The waitress was attentive and responsive despite a crowded house.  The head sushi chef was incredibly friendly and nice. We had a great chat with my limited japanese. Sit at the sushi bar for good conversations."}
