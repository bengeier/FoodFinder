{"text":"This Bakery(??) got some Amazing Wife cake(???). I think it was famous since long time in Toronto area.  I saw 3 stores they are having right now. MUST TRY them all! My mom call them for order. And they call do order from the phone and pick up later. So nice people!"}

{"text":"Tried the Wife Cake and it's definitely the best I can remember tasting. 

Actually it's really quite a pleasant surprise to be able to find traditional Chinese or Hong Kong treats in Toronto that's so outstanding that I would say it's better than a lot of average shops in the streets of Hong Kong (from experience of living in HK).

Crust was thin and soft and the wintermelon filling was plentiful and soft as well.

Not sure what else this place do well with, but there wasn't much other products to offer at this location.

Heard they have a Scarborough location with a much bigger selection.

However, if all you are looking for is a good, fresh and soft Wife Cake, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Small bakery so not much variety, but I found what I was looking for! They sold five types of mochi and I decided to buy the custard mochi, black sesame red bean mochi and the black sesame mochi with black sesame filling. $1.80 for two black sesame mochi and $0.90 for one custard mochi. It was delicious! Will be back next time I'm in the area looking for baked goods. There are three bakeries in the mall very close to one another, so there is quite some competition."}
{"text":"This place offers traditional Chinese pastry for Chinese wedding like the melon paste \"wife\" cake, preserved egg or salty egg tart, sponge cake, etc. They have nice packages as gifts for the bride family from groom side as a Chinese custom.

I especially love the melon paste \"Wife\" cake because it is always fresh and soft, not overly sweeten."}
{"text":"Aroma Bakery has opened up another location up at New Kennedy Square Mall.

The set up here is more spacious than the other locations. However, it just lacked that \"oh! Something smell so so good\" vibe.

Of course they have their famous Wife (wintermelon) cake which is always a must when I visit one of the Aroma Bakeries..."}
{"text":"I do enjoy simpler things in life. With this newer trend of fancy bakery shops popping up all over Toronto and GTA, I starting to value some traditional Chinese pastry. They are not photo worthy or can attract all these LIKES, but food is more than just worth posting online.

Sweetheart Cake ??? or Wife's Cake is one of those classic examples. There are a few folklore of who and why this was named. But I do love the chewiness and the QQ texture as glutinous rice flour is used to mix in with candied wintermelon.

One of the best Chinese bakery to get one of these is at Aroma Bakery. They baked all their pastries on site and you can just smell how good they are even before stepping in."}
