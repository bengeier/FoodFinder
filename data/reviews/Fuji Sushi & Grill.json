{"text":"Service was quick but the portions are not small for sushi. My maki roll was more rice then the small piece of tuna. The sashimi pieces we're about 1&1/2 inch square verse other sushi places with longer pieces. I'm disappointed"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi I've had in pittsburgh (at least to my tastes because I'm used to the style sushi they made closer to DC). Everyone who works there if friendly, and the man behind the sushi bar has a great personality. Strike up a conversation when you go! If it's your first time with sushi, try the \"o\" roll!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Sushi and after reading bad reviews about Saga in the new Settlers Ridge area of Robinson, I googled and found Fuji Sushi. ( I have been to Saga before and do agree, the service sucked and the food didn't make up for it) To my delight, Fuji Sushi is very good! I would recommend the \"O\" Roll. It was buy one specialty roll, get second half off that night... but it seemed to me that was a typical thing. The address on yelp and on other websites seems to be wrong.... I had to call to find out it was located in the shopping area with the Downy House on 60 (steubenville pike) in Robinson next to Fox's pizza. Its BYOB with no cork fee. The decor is a bit misleading when you walk in, seeming more like a quick lunch type of place, but the sushi is very very good. The waiter was nice and everything was fast. I live in the outer Robinson area and I plan to start recommending this place to others and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I wassuper hungry and was exicted to eat but food was very underwhelming. I ordered dragon roll which just tasted like thick teriyaki sauce and ordered rainbow roll which tasted like mayonnaise. They put way too much sauce and that is all u taste. Also very thin cuts of fish and heavy on rice and sauce.  Will never return. I mean u can just buy some rice and sauce at home and eat it and it would taste the same. My mouth and stomach just feel like it is full of MSG.  I am gonna just go get some chick fil a ice cream. I have had a lot of sushi in my life and this isnt good at all."}
{"text":"Bad customer service trumps good food

I've been to this place at least 5 times prior and now I'm not going back. Apparently the customer isn't right here. I ordered a salmon hand roll (marked on the paper with HR) but got a maki roll. I voiced this to the server, also pointing out the HR on the sheet, who addressed it with the sushi chef (who may also be the owner) and the response was \"I prepared it as it said on the paper!!!\" The server was even trying to tell the sushi chef that it's supposed to be a hand roll but to no avail (the restaurant is small enough to hear everything). I then went to the sushi chef and received the same annoyed response. 

The food isn't worth the bad service."}
{"text":"Sushi rice was seasoned well but was mushy. Did not finish meal because of this.  Fish and presentation was ok.  Prices were a little above average.  Special roll pieces too big to eat.   Chef was nice and welcoming but seemed to treat waitress as a spouse (slightly disrespectful) in front of me.  Made me a little uncomfortable.  Did not care for extra sauces but at least they were on the side.  Atmosphere is what you would expect for this strip mall.  Not fancy but clean.  I prefer market district sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh. Love how the owner makes the spicy tuna rolls with a chunk of tuna instead of minced scraps like most sushi places to. Don't let the exterior scare you away. Good stuff and always fresh."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice, but not the most personable I've ever had. She gave us menus and an order sheet (like the ones in the back of catalogs). All of their special rolls are bogo 1/2 off.  The sushi was really good, but as another reviewer said, there was a lot of sauce on the rolls. Since we sat at the bar, we struck up a conversation with Tommy, the owner and maker of the sushi. He's a really good guy, and definitely made the experience memorable. 

This is a great neighborhood spot. The sushi is great, and the menu is so big that you will never run out of options. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst place!  Sushi is not fresh, coke does not taste like coke and the waitress is extremely rude.  Never will return here!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi here. Always great, and affordable. Friendly atmosphere. I always stop when I'm on this side of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"They advertise Beer , however this is a BYOB place. The hostess is the waitress. Not polite, They make you check your order off of a menu with a pencil, but this doesn't matter because they can't read. It. We received different items then what we ordered. Not a warm atmosphere. The egg rolls tasted frozen and warmed up not fresh. I've had much better Sushi. This should be a Fun warm inviting atmosphere but even the kitchen is sketchy. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good. Sushi...not so much. Shrimp and crab were imitation meat. Rolls were very heavy on rice...more than should be in a roll. Every roll was absolutely drenched in some sort of sauce, probably to cover the fakeness of what was inside. It's a shame because I've had really good sushi before and had high expectations of this place based on other reviews."}
{"text":"Nice smaller setting, but very comfortable. Family run business who you can tell cares, it shows in the food. The sushi was VERY fresh and the cuts were thick. Wonderful flavor, great presentation. I well be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi!!! This is the place, I do recommend and will be returning myself upon my next visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I will begin my review with the reminder that this is the western suburbs of Pittsburgh.  Not much should really be expected concerning sushi.  But I have had great sushi in landlocked regions before so here goes it. 
For starters, they decor is old and dirty looking. Actually it is dirty when you sit at the bar and get a closer look. But they do store the vacuum on the restaurant floor right next to me at the bar, so some cleaning must take place . It's after 5 o'clock on a Thursday and one couple are the only patrons besides me. Very quiet as there is no music, tv or background sound. From other reviews I gather Tommy is the chef. Nice enough. The only other employee may be his wife. Not nice enough.  I ask for help ordering and she tells me to look at the pictures in the menu. Poor pics btw. 
House Salad w/Ginger Dressing...something is off. Tastes closer to Creamy French. 
My Edame appy shows up with the salad. 
My sushi special is handed over the bar food case by Tommy just as she walks away from dropping the salad and edamame. Guess it's going to be buffet night for me. The TNT roll is fresh but one of the fishes is chewy on some bites. Gack! The sauce is too much mayo and not enough Siracha. Although I was not looking for spicy, less sauce would be less mayo overload. 
I came here because the nearby place had really poor ratings. This place gets 3 stars for a relative comparison taking in the area expectations. 

Ps. The phone never rang the entire time I was there up to 6pm...odd considering the massive commuter rush hour that takes place at this time in Pittsburgh. Take out anyone?  I guess not here.
Pss. No Amex taken here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've had. I wish we lived closer so we could get it more often. If your in the area you definitely have to try this place! You won't regret it. Don't let the strip mall or store front stop you. It's well worth a visit. Tommy, the owner and chef, is awesome. Very friendly and definitely makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim. The sushi was not good at all, it tasted old and rubbery."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the servers are so friendly. However there are only two people ever working at a time. Be prepared to wait at least an hour and a half. It's worth it though!!"}
{"text":"I have traveled from the east to the west and as an avid fan of sushi, I would  rank Fuji Sushi as one of the best. The prices are very fair and the specials make it even better. It is a BYOB place and I find that kinda appealing. From the outside looking in you may want to pass this place up, if you do, you will miss out on a great experience.

Hands down, one of the greatest!"}
{"text":"I walked in during a bad snow storm on my commute home. I was the only patron in the establishment at the time. One of my biggest peeves about sushi places are ones the call time rolls \"spicy\" because they drown it in a sauce. They just put regular, unseasoned tuna in a roll and pour sauce on it. This is what is going on here. I think this is a ploy to cover up low grade sushi. Overall, I thought it was lower quality than other establishments in the area and quite expensive. I'd recommend skipping and patronizing slippery mermaid in sewickley or ichiban in Robinson."}
{"text":"Tried their sushi to go the other day - got two specialty rolls, best sushi ever!  Large, tasty, reasonably priced.  Glanced over the menu and can't wait to bring the family here for a dinner as they had a menu similar to a Benihana but very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not only was Sushi Chef Tommy cracking everyone up, the sushi was fantastic.  They have all of the standards, plus pages of special rolls that they have invented.  It was also reasonably priced.  So BYOB and avoid the chain restaurants in Robinson (technically McKees Rocks) and go to Fuji Sushi :)"}
{"text":"Passing through and saw the menu and decided to pick some up, what a great find!  The seafood and steak, UNO and the Maui roll were amazing -- some of the best I have ever had.  Super friendly and fast!  A must if in the area."}
{"text":"Our experience was okay.  The owner was awesome but all the sushi was drenched in way too much mayo and Eel sauce.  It was not the best we've had."}
{"text":"So the sushi is by far superior compared to the options in the area. My fiancé and I have gone twice now and we've been really happy with our sushi both times. AND it's BYOB so you save a lot bringing your own wine or what have you. The only negatives (hence the 3 stars) is that the service is crazyyyy slow and the atmosphere is very awkward. To the point where we've really wanted sushi and wanted Fuji but chosen elsewhere because we want to have fun and enjoy each other's company, too. The first time we went there was one other couple and no music or anything in a brightly lit dining area. The problem=you don't want to talk at all. You feel as though you have to whisper and it's just really uncomfortable. The second time we went it was the same stuff just with more people dining. They really have something going right here with the food, but just putting on some music and getting an extra server would greatly improve the dining experience. Also, you can order food to-go (which we attempted to do for our first dining experience) but they won't tell you what's in a roll on the phone when ordering because people 'steal' his recipes. He will tell you to come in and look at the menu then order which defeats the purpose of ordering carry out. Again, awesome food just flawed in execution."}
{"text":"From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the sushi is definitely in my top 5 in Pittsburgh. My friend always talks about this place and we finally stopped in for lunch over the weekend. I have had sushi from a lot of different places. Places that you would think the sushi would be fresh, but the rice leaves you feeling differently. Fuji sushi was extremely fresh and the rice was not dry at all! 

I ordered the ebi maki roll and the piano roll. The ebi maki was definitely one of the larger rolls and it came with asparagus, shrimp tempura, blue crab and the white yum yum sauce was drizzled on top. Topped with thinly sliced shrimp. The piano roll was your basic sushi roll size and came topped with thinly sliced avocado and wasabi drizzle on top. Pretty sure there was cucumber in this one with shrimp tempura. 

Both of these rolls were delicious and presented so beautifully! You can't beat the buy 1 get 1 half off. It's so worth it. Do yourself a favor and get yourself some sushi from Fuji."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it never gets old. Tommy, the one and only chef, is always welcoming and friendly to his patrons. Since we moved away, it has been a year since I have been to this place and I am happy to report, the OMG roll (that is set ablaze table side) is still an explosion to my senses. They have also many other unique special rolls to try! If sushi isn't your thing, you can order some warm dishes too."}
{"text":"Great sushi for amazing prices! One guy runs it and rarely has help, so it's not super speedy, but sushi can take a while no matter where you go. They're closed on Sundays, but give it a try if you haven't been there yet and like sushi."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant in a little strip. The sushi prices are spot on and it doesn't hurt that it's BYOB. Rated it four stars bc of the prices but they are a little heavy on the rice."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars for this place. I had read where some other yelpers had commented on the over whelming sauce.  My husband and I actually ended up here on accident, either way it was a very expensive accident lol. 43.00$ for lunch eek! 

We were told to seat ourselves and did so. What I really did like was the pictures they had of most of the rolls! This was very helpful. There was only one waitress and she did a great job of keeping our water filled and getting us our food as quickly as she could. The Gyoza was great!! In fact I would go back for that. However not the sushi...it was mediocre.

There was wayyyy to much sauce on the entire plate that was touching other sushi I am sure it was not meant for. The size of the rolls was great! I was happy that they gave us a big portion and I was full rather quickly but I was not impressed with the sushi itself. The rice was way more sticky than I have ever see and the actually sushi didn't have much actual food inside of it. It seemed amateur, yes like a amateur sushi for lunch.

If I am ever in the area I would try them again and maybe the sushi chef will be having a better day."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently moved to this area of Pittsburgh. We found Fuji and have been regulars since. Probably go at least once a week. Tommy and his wife run this place themselves. To me the restaurant is what I expect from a small mom and pop place in Pittsburgh. It's old but has charm. The food is good I always get rolls. My fiancé will get the sushi and he's definitely one to comment about food and he is always happy with it. Also try the egg rolls they're amazing. If you have the pleasure of dining here understand its run by 2 people and you might have to wait but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Tommy (the owner) is a great guy, but he's definitely having trouble keeping up with the business, and, as such, quality has suffered. 

The OMG roll is still a great presentation and the slightly seared edges are great after unwrapping the foil from the roll. 

Unfortunately though, the rice was rather heavily vinegared, and thus sour, and not all the product in the case looked as fresh as it could have been. 

I tipped well and wish him and the business the best, but probably won't check back in for a while. 

I hope Fuji can recover to its former level soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in Pittsburgh. Very fresh and reasonable. The rolls are amazing and the presentation is impressive. I hate chain restaurants so I'm thrilled I found this little treasure. BYOB is always a plus."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. The interior is nothing too fancy just simple. We went here instead of heading downtown for some sushi and so glad we found this place. We had the eggroll which was so good. Then multiple sushi and the price was so reasonable. Def recommend this place"}
{"text":"Delicious and beyond reasonably priced.  The owner and chef, Tommy, is an all around awesome person who gives the restaurant a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.

Recommended are his Piano, Philadelphia, and Spicy Tuna Crunch Rolls. All will leave you more than satisfied, and won't murder your wallet. 

Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"This review is only based off of customer service rather than food quality or in-restaurant experience because the woman who answered the phone was so rude that I took my business elsewhere. My boyfriend and I are new to the area and have been trying out local places to eat and have been very happy with the food options around Oakdale. When I ran into this place I noticed the majority of people gave it a thumbs up (with the exception of others also experiencing poor customer service)so we figured we would order takeout and give it a try. I called and asked about their vegetarian sushi menu because I have a shellfish allergy and steer clear of any seafood based sushi. The woman who I spoke to was very rude and basically told me she had no idea of what I was asking her and I would have to drive there simply to see what options they had available because she had no answer to give me... when she had no idea what a shellfish allergy was and if any of the rolls they make contain it, I second guessed if I even called the right phone number. Maybe down the road we will try this place again, but for now I will steer clear of the rude customer service."}
{"text":"A guy I was seeing was looking for a sushi place to take me on our second date and found Fuji. I was a little hesitant at first but the saying \"Never judge a book by it's cover\" holds very true about Fuji. 

It's a small little place but the sushi is by far the best I've ever had! It quickly became our favorite spot and everyone I've taken there has loved it as well. Never have I tasted sushi that was so good it didn't even need soy sauce. Their rice has a vinegary taste to it and is not bland like most sushi I've tasted."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place. After moving to pittsburgh recently, I found it on a whim. I am impressed by their quality of rolls (especially considering the price). The buy one get one 1/2 off offer still stands for all of their special rolls. 

The rainbow roll that I ordered had sauce on top, which was kind of weird - but the fish itself was fantastic. They also seem to have high quality sticky rice that is properly seasoned with vinegar. 

Today I had a sashimi lunch with a california roll & miso soup. It was all delicious but the salmon especially was to-die-for! Tommy was quite quiet, but it was business as usual, so it wasn't my concern. I took it to go, so I was eager to be in and out - which I was!

I am definitely going to head there for lunch more often!"}
{"text":"This place has very good sushi at a reasonable price. The restaurant is cute and cozy and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"First up this is a 3.5 star place.

We went there for lunch at around 1215 on a Wed.

We walked in and there was only one other patron who at first we didn't see so we wondered if it was not open yet, then a waitress said go ahead and pick a seat. 

Cons
-they put WAY TOO much sauce on the rolls

-the sushi rolls themselves were okay 3 stars, the flavor wasn't all that great, not bad but not good

-the rolls themselves had a lot of rice, not enough filling

Pros
-bento box for $15 was pretty good, I especially liked the tempura and the variety  (more than other bento boxes I have had )

-fried gyoza was good

-lunch specials are a decent value, but whenever my wife and I eat sushi we, especially me get selfish and order a bunch. The bento box would have been fine, but I also ordered a special roll and had 2 of her gyoza.

-service was friendly 

Our tab before tip was $43
Bento box
Gyoza
California roll
2 x special rolls"}
{"text":"Fantastic little joint. Unassuming, but really fresh food. I appreciate the minimal, yet welcoming decor. Try the OMG roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Fantastic. I've never had sushi served on fire! While the food is a touch pricey, it is certainly worth it. Great place for a sushi date!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi I ever ate! The prices are too high we waited for the 3 sushi rolls more than a half an hour and nobody was inside just us, the rice was sticky and we had stomachache after we ate the sushi! Don't go there anymore :("}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday (Friday), arriving at about 4:30 pm. When we arrived we were the only customers, but we thought it was early so we stayed. When we left about about 5:45, there was one customer who had takeout, and one solo customer. The rest of the restaurant was empty. The remainder of the review might give you a hint of why.

We ordered an order of pork dumplings to share, and we each ordered two special rolls. The pork dumplings tasted like raw onion powder. The sushi had its own issues. It arrived smothered with sauce; I used my chopsticks to scrape some of it off. I'm used to having sushi with a little drizzle of sauce. Also, thinking back on it, the proportion of rice to other ingredients seemed to be too much. The diameter of the sushi pieces was extremely large. Each piece was so unwieldy to pick up, let alone shove the whole thing in your mouth without having it break into pieces. At least the sushi was edible, once the sauce was removed.

When the server took our plates away and asked us how everything was, I said that the taste was there, but the pieces were hard to handle because they were too big. She told me that's because they were special rolls. I literally had to bite my tongue, because I have had special rolls many times at other restaurants, and they never looked like sushi on steroids. Right after my husband and I walked out the door, we both said that we didn't need to return."}
{"text":"Fuji Sushi & Grill was where we decided to find sustenance prior to our lackluster night at Grim's Roadhouse late last week. Japanese fare is always a safe wager when it comes to Lady K, and for the most part, we were rewarded. 

We walked in and were told \"Anywhere's fine,\" by a young man wearing a Japanese Happi coat! How Iron Chef is that?

Considering our plans for musical entertainment later in the evening, we got the Hard Rock Rolls as a starter. Unfortunately, I can't find a menu online and didn't think to snap a photo of the menu (I gotta start doin' that!), so therefore I can't recall what exactly was in it, but it was a crispy, squishy, sticky delight that I do seem to remember involving crab, tempura (I think it was flash-fried), avocado, and cream cheese. Yes, sushi is the Far East equivalent of the cupcake; trendy, stylish, attention-seeking. Personally, I still like sashimi more, but it just tastes the same no matter where I sample it. Anyway, the Hard Rock Rolls...well, rock-and-roll like it's been a long time, been a long time, 
been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

The Spicy Seafood entree was my main course. Shrimp, calamari, and scallops wallowed in an auburn mire of a sauce that was delightfully peppery, but just like the best Indian dishes (and this definitely came off as Indian), the spiciness was just teetering on the edge if you will. It was at that bewitching spot right before your threshold of discomfort, where your tongue is still barely welcoming the pins/needles sensation. And of course the calamari had that snap upon incision, the shrimp being a little more submissive to the teeth, and the scallops even more so--impeccably prepared seafood. 

The fried rice I ordered as a side was sublimity as well, its rich flavor and fluffy texture causing me to wolf it down with no quarter given.

I cannot remember what Kay had, and was so engrossed in my own meal that I never even asked her for a bite. 

I suppose I should knock off one star for the obligatory and mediocre miso soup and ginger salad. I really didn't need it, but it came with the meal, so...

It's in a strip mall, which in Pittsburgh is not a surprise to me anymore."}
{"text":"Sushi is made the \"lazy\" way. Instead of cutting the cucumbers into small strips for the rolls, it is just one big chunk, which makes it crunchy.  Some people may like it that way, but I don't.  I also ordered the Toro (fatty tuna) and got regular old tuna, but charged almost $10 for it.  I hate liars who false advertise on the menu.  The salmon was good, though."}
{"text":"I've tried a number of different sushi places, both expensive and cheap, and Fuji Sushi is an expensive experience for a cheap price. The best of both worlds. Everything I'd tried is superb, flavor and textures are great. Rolls are large, plating is impressive, and prices are stellar. For a work lunch, this is the best option bar none. I highly recommend trying something with grilled eel, it was like a piece of \"fish filet mignon\", really a great flavor.

I will be back, and will bring others."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. Tommy is excellent, and always prepared to tell stories! While I sushi is amazing, be prepared to wait a little. I just know to not be in a hurry when I stop by, definitely worth it for sushi in the Robinson area."}
{"text":"There is zero reason why this place gets anything less than 5 stars.  It may take awhile sometimes (due to lack of manpower) but sometimes you wait for high quality.  And it's BYOB! So sit back, have a beer, and enjoy easily the best sushi in and around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Sushi is just ok now.  too many tempura, shrimp and crab options on the specialty menu.  Our waitress seemed to be drugged or sleepwalking, not sure which.  She gave a lackluster apology after we waited for an hour and a half for only 3 rolls.  It was pathetic.  I have never waited that long for any food in my life, and it would have had to knock me out to be worth it.  I expect to have something comped after an hour and a half wait.  We should have left, but after you wait so long you just assume it has to be coming out soon.  I won't be back, and this place was one of my faves a few years ago."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for years but never wanted to try sushi until recently. 
Fuji is amazing! It's a very small place in a strip mall. The menu is great, especially for sushi beginners because it has descriptions and pictures as well as clear prices. We ordered three of the regular rolls (Philly, Crab and Tuna/Avocado) and two specialty (Hard Rock and Lobster) and we each got a coke and our bill was just over $35 which was not bad for as much food as we got. The rolls tasted so fresh and were delicious.
There were two people working, which is common from what I understand, and they were fairly busy when we were there at dinnertime on a Friday during lent, and we still got our food very quickly. 
We were very happy with our meal and I cannot wait to go back! I picked up a menu which allows you to fax it in and they have some great lunch specials, I'm definitely going to give them a try for lunch."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant lunch here one afternoon. I was waited on immediately and sat at the sushi bar. 
I ordered the sashimi lunch, which came with 9 pieces of sashimi (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and octopus) and 8 pieces of California roll. 
The fish was fresh and well-plated. The California roll reminded me why having sushi at a restaurant is so much better than say, picking up sushi at the market district; it's the temperature! The rice tasted like it was just made, and it warms the Cali roll to room temperature so that you can taste the flavors! Excellent!"}
