{"text":"Amazing sushi, I love going here because it's decent price for good sushi.   What I don't like is the servers, they never smile, can't seem to figure out how to take care of there tables. I am a regular here, I go about once a weekend and the servers are still rude. Never expect a drink refill or for them to talk to you after you get your food."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi junkie. I've hit up almost every sushi joint that I've been able to find in Phoenix including the places that identified merely with a yellow sign outside that says...\"SUSHI\"!   That's why I was so excited to try out Yen. I loved the place the second I walked in. The atmosphere was great, the people were friendly, and the location for me is excellent. Unfortunately for this sushi joint...I really only care about the sushi. That's why one of my favorite places in town is a hole in wall over on Dunlap and 19th Ave. I was so disappointed with the quality of the fish and the actual rolls. We ordered about eight rolls and only finished two of them. You basically have your choice of eel or fried and these are tempura battered rolls I'm talking about. I enjoy light sushi which is the way sushi is supposed to be. A fried tuna roll that weighs over a pound is just too heavy. I'll give it another shot for sure because I really do think it's a nice place but I was shocked that it's Yelp score was as high as it was."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their Sushi. Went here last weekend and got Sushi to-go. I like the décor of the restaurant, it's dark and is actually updated and looks modern.  I had a California roll, crunch roll, & a Rock N Roll. (I'm no sushi expert, I just like the simple sushi rolls)They were really good no complaints there. Good service from the hostess and didn't take long at all. My only complaint is that the rolls seemed a little overpriced, but I wasn't there during Happy Hour time so maybe they are cheaper then."}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest place to get good quality  sushi and sashimi in town. Strongly recommend this place if you like Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, very innovative with use of ingredients. Tomato, jalapeño, etc. May not be traditional, however well executed. The Ono Sashimi shows great respect for fish, just garlicky soy sauce, radish. Quite good. Service is good, Paul is a great chef. Sit at counter, enjoy the show."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at a reasonable price! Clean restaurant with speedy, friendly service. Best rainbow roll my husband and I had ever had. Will definitely be returning to this gem."}
{"text":"This place is traditional with it's japanese heritage looks, yet not with there traditional sushi bar openings. Most sushi bars are NOT open on Sundays, yet this one is! It's amazing. I love it. Especially there happy hour days are to die for! 3-5 & 8-close! 5 dollar expensive sushi rolls! I am a california roll fan, and they have this 'crazy boy roll' with is tempura california roll, MMMMMazing! Only one dislike...they serve soda out of cans. boo=["}
{"text":"Wow. Just Wow.   Took advantage of happy hour tonight and I'm impressed. $5 Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna Tempura rolls. The Spicy Tuna roll is hands down my favorite from anywhere so far.  The Spicy Tataki and Heart Attack rolls had the heat I was wanting, however the heat from the Tataki Roll came out of nowhere and bowled me over with spice.  The wonderful rolls with 2 BIG bottles of Saporo for $3 a pop and out the door for under $50 really made our night.   We'll definitely be back.    My only issue has nothing to do with the restaurant. The domain listed on their take home menu isn't owned by anyone at the moment. Picky I know, but a massive pet peeve of mine. If you are restaurant, have a website and one that is mobile accessible. I was going to knock off half a star for this, but I then realized it's part of a chain in California and they don't have any control over it. So 5 stars it stays."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and customer service was great. They have a really good Happy Hour; $5 sushi rolls. We ordered 3 rolls which filled us up. It's a cute little place and although it's kind of hidden, it seems to be getting a lot of attention!"}
{"text":"Came and visited for my first time while on my business trip from California. Let me warn YOU! Garbage tasting food, garbage ass sushi.. and I'm being nice right now..... should have known, can't expect authentic sushi in middle of the desert. Shaking my head. Stomach hurting so much now, about to throw up!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi bars I have been to...  And I am not just saying this b/c I live on the same street as yen sushi.... however the service is HORRIBLE!  Waitress didnt ever come to check on me in a 45 minute period (after me asking one of the sushi chefs to have them get me more water).  My first roll came out 20 min before my other 2  and on top of that, in the hour i was there,  when i ordered something to go after my meal it wasnt even what i ordered (well not completely).    Here is what happened with what i ordered.  I ordered a spicy octopus roll to go (one of my favorites)  all that was in my to go box was some white rice with some sesame seeds on it!!!   wtf?!?!?!  and i didnt notice this until well after i got home (after they were closed)  b/c it was a snack for later!   so my suggestion is that you ONLY GO THERE WHEN GARY IS WORKING AS THE SUSHI CHEF!  all the other chefs suck balls!    i also saw the other two chefs screw up other peoples orders twice while i was there.  both couples sent their food back!  This is not the first time i have seen cooks, other than Gary, screw up peoples stuff.  I have seen it on a good handful of occations (usually at night).  so go for lunch or before the main crowd.  this all goes to show that even the best place some times hires a shitty Chef... make sure you know your sushi chefs b/c that is the key in having good sushi.   and all other cooks other than gary suck balls at that place.  so be careful and dont go eat there if you dont see Gary behind the sushi line.  i use to give them a full 5 stars but i had to redo my review after a lot of visits there.  However i will for sure still go there when Gary is working ... he really truly is a GREAT sushi chef!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly and service is prompt.  I can't wait to come again to have yummy sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here was good. Wish they had more rolls on the happy hour menu. I really liked how small this place was. The sushi was awesome and the happy hour rolls were reasonably priced.  This is a popular spot so get there early to avoid the lines..."}
{"text":"Always fresh. The happy hour is great with a decent selection off apps, rolls, beer, and sake all around $5. I usually get a roll or 2 on HH but then have to always get some ala carte nigiri. The halibut, salmon, and yellowtail belly are all great. Being just down the street for me it's a no brainier."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, hands down... The baked lobster roll, and heart attack roll are both incredible..."}
{"text":"Was greeted with smiles, everyone was cool with the fact I was on a date with myself. The food was good and it was affordable. Smiles all around :-)"}
{"text":"Their sushi is amazing BUT the chefs are ridiculously rude for no apparent reason...and I tip them every time I sit @ the counter...I don't even get a I Nishi Wah it's all good--cause they their sushi is"}
{"text":"Note: I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars, but since they only allow full star ratings, i'm leaning towards the 5.   This place is right around the corner from my house, has really high quality sushi, a great happy hour, and good prices. It's my new favorite sushi place!  Service: We went during happy hour, so the place was packed. The food came out in an acceptable time considering the number of people. The staff was attentive and told us when the happy hour pricing changed so we would be aware on the bill. Knowing they were on top of it, made me not worry about anything and just relax. Our cups were refilled in a timely manner, and we were offered our choice of seating. So, no complaints on service.   Food: No complaints on the sushi either. The texture and flavors of the fish were exactly what i like in my sushi.  The chili crab roll on the happy hour menu will keep us coming back for a long time. We look forward to trying new rolls each time as well!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restraunt in AZ. You know a good restraunt when the food  quality is consistent. Great fresh sushi. I usualy order the lunch special yellow tail scallion roll with salmon, tuna,and shrimp sushi. I think it's around $8 dollars. I've been going to this spot for about 3 years and I will continue to go. Wait staff is friendly and the owners are great. Thanks Yen for your amazing food!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi place I have ever been to (have never lived near the ocean). Everything was fresh. The king crab and asparagus roll was the best sushi roll I have ever had...the asparagus was cooked to perfection and cooled to the perfect temperature, the king crab melt-in-your mouth goodness, and the plate was dotted with a delicious spicy red chili sauce that complemented it all perfectly! The tuna and scallion roll was fabulous...the tuna was very fresh and clean tasting. Our friends had the baked scallop roll and boy was that decadent! Yum! It was a California roll topped with scallops in a rich cream-based sauce, broiled beautifully. The plain California roll was also excellent. The king crab roll was very good...a pocket of nori stuffed with a wonderful shredded king crab salad. I don't know how any other sushi place in Phoenix is going to compare to this."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Delightful staff!    We love this place.  You always feel welcomed any time or day of the week. The atmosphere is intimate, and the staff are always smiling and quick with service.  I give the 4 out of 5 stars only due to the fumes of the nail salon next door. I don't know if Yens can do anything to prevent it,  but sometimes it's overbearing.   Great job Yens staff!"}
{"text":"What a dump!! The waitress forgot my wife's order, brought the beer with the glass stuck in the top of the bottle. No traditional Japanese greeting when entering and I don't think they cared if I left or not- I hate places that you have to hunt down the waitress to find your order, then hunt the ass again so you can have another beer. Really if you're that lazy-- just stay home like the rest of the people who don't want a job. Never again after living in Japan for 5 years with good sushi every wear these people need some serious training- YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food.  3 stars for the service.  The sushi is among the best in town.  I have never had a bad experience with the food.  The service seems to be getting better.  I stopped going here for a few months due to bad service but the thought of the food drew me back.  I have not found better Ono anywhere in town.  The Forever Young roll combines the Ono with REAL king crab - I dream about eating it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They make delicious sushi and are pretty quick at doing it even when it's SUPER busy. Expect to be waiting a bit for reverse happy hour on the weekends. Staff is super friendly and helpful. There's only one girl that seems like she hates her job every time we go in there but for the most part everyone is super great! We've ventured to other sushi places since eating here and they just do not compete!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend who raves about it. the food was good. Nice selection of rolls and the sashmi was very fresh and good. I ordered the peach sohcu to drink...Not sure what it was suppopsed to taste like but it basicially was semi chilled peach schnapps in a martini glass. My only suggestion for the place would be to clean it up just a little. There were  some old dirty napkins under the table to stop it from wiggling and the childrens changing table in the womens bathroom was dirty. But over all great location and good food."}
{"text":"Best in town and i've eaten at a lot of different sushi bars.  This one takes the cake well beyond even some more expensive Scottsdale locations.  Sushi is fresh and tasty.  The arrangements are very nice, not over the top so you still know what you're about to eat.  Happy hour menu contains lots of $5 choices, including large sake bombers!    If you're vegan or veg, this place has lots of options for you.  Get the Veggie Gyoza appetizer, you will not regret it.  Staff is extremely friendly, seating is unique with a long cushioned bench along one side.  Perfect for groups of up to 8-10.  To the regulars: please stop bringing your babies.  I know happy hour is worthy of daily visits, but your kids are crying because they don't want to be there."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaraunt in Phoenix. We go here as often as we can and they never dissapoint.   Happy hour is wonderful."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice quiet corner place for the entire family, this is the place, don't let the location fool you.  We love it..good price and great happy hour.  taking the kid tonight...btw."}
{"text":"If you are seriously sashimi lover,go for somewhere else.They served smelly fish and I couldn't believe they put sesame oil on hamachi!"}
{"text":"What more can I say that everyone else hasn't said? I found this place through this website so I decided to go with my mom for my birthday for the 8 to close happy hour. We walk in and are immediately greeted by the owner. The waitress was so friendly and helpful. We got the smoked salmon sushi (avocado, smoked salmon, with lemon wedges), Spicy tuna tempura rolls, fresh salmon sashimi, salmon roll ( salmon, crab, avocado, cucumber and deep fried) with $3 large bottle Kirin and $5 watermelon martini. All I can say is WOW!!! Last time had such great sushi was in Maui. The salmon sashimi was like butter in my mouth. This beats the other sushi bars that are in Scottsdale and Tempe. Even with out the happy hour prices it is so very cheap for the quality of sushi. We are going back tomorrow with others so they can experience this amazing jewel in the desert."}
{"text":"I went there with four of my friends. expecting good price and good shuhi. After paying over $130 but feel still hungry -- speciality was not that special to me. only over-priced. also waiting for 20 ,min to get seated. Sporry I won't gp back"}
{"text":"Met my family for Happy Hour for the first time and I was greatly impressed.  Happy Hour Sushi is delicious.  I would come back just for the Crazy Boy.  It is a small intimate place yet very family friendly.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yen and Wild Tuna seem to be the two best Sushi bars I've eaten at in Phoenix.  Still moving down the list - may have some revising to do. Nothing outstanding, just decent.  I have to admit my coastal bias, having come from the Bay Area.  The stars I give in AZ for sushi are like kindergarten teachers' gold ones - trumped up to encourage further accomplishments by the sushi tykes."}
{"text":"This was our second time at this place . The sushi is very good but, the servers are not aware of customer needs. We asked for Sapporo beer and the server needed us to repeat our request 3 times in order to understand. The servers seemed disorganized. One African American server seemed lazy and not very interested in the customers. She needed encouragement and direction. Almost like she didn't want to be their. Servers are the backbone of a good restaurant. I assumed the owner was one of the sushi chefs. I also heard a conversation on the phone from an unsatisfied customer. My girlfriend is korean and interpreted the conversation. Not good customer relations. If I was the owner, I would care more about customer relations and good staff than overall profit. Owner needs to wake up."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time this weekend. We loved it! Best sushi I've had in a while. The prices are comparable to other sushi restaurants but I think the quality and flavors are better. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Paul is the man.  I accidentally stumbled upon this place one day with coworkers for dinner.  We sat at the bar where Paul, the owner and head sushi chef, promptly struck up a great conversation with us.  Ever since, this is a weekly visit for me.    Paul always is honest with his fish, tells me what is fresh and what isn't.  For newcomers, I definitely would recommend sitting at the bar and getting to know the fish.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tonight, I cheated on this place by trying another sushi spot. Huge mistake, There is not a better sushi spot in Phoenix then Yen sushi. Tucked away in a shopping center, looks are deceiving. The food is always fresh and delicious and has yet to disappoint. I am a fan of the nigiri style of sushi, and do not do California rolls. This place is heaven for people who like REAL sushi. I have been a loyal customer to this place since I discovered them a year and a half ago. People who say they can't find good sushi in Arizona have not tried Yen!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local sushi spot! Always tastes super fresh & the service is solid even when they're busy! Try the sunset roll - simple, but so yummy!! Good happy hour selections too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's always busy for their awesome happy hour but the service never suffers!  I've been coming here for years and happy to see that they've expanded."}
{"text":"Food is garbage. Service is worse.  $6 happy hour rolls aren't worth $2..."}
{"text":"We had heard some good things about Yen Sushi so we decided to try it on a Sunday evening during happy hour. I ordered sushi off the happy hour menu and my companion ordered hamachi kama, which is her favorite Japanese dish. The sushi was good and priced at only $5 a roll. However, when the kama arrived it was not only smallest kama we had ever seen but it was so grotesquely over cooked that it was inedible. When we informed the server she immediately removed it from our bill."}
{"text":"Service is always great here. Sushi is amazing.  I too wish they would expand the happy hour menu but as for the rolls on there....AMAZING. I'm hooked"}
{"text":"Thanks to all the positive reviews on Yelp, my girl Danielle & I tried this place out last night.  For a Wednesday night this place was packed! There were 2 parties ahead of us waiting for a table so we opted to sit at the bar.  We started off with sake bombers. Only $5 each! I think we got a good 4-5 shots from it, so good!! I don't have too much experience with sushi so I let D order everything. From the happy hour menu she ordered the crazy boy roll & the philly roll, both only $5 each. From the regular menu she ordered the dragon roll & the yellowtail. These were all a 1st for me. The crazy boy was so yummy, I like it better than crunchy rolls which I used to always get. The philly roll was delicious, all the flavors went together perfectly! I didn't really care for the dragon roll, the eel on top was not appealing to me at all & I spilled some sake on it lol. The yellowtail was by far my favorite, even though it looked really scary when they 1st brought it out! I can't believe how good it was, so simple yet so amazing! I am definitely getting more than 1 order of it next visit.   Our total came out to $42 & some change, what a deal! We will definitely be back, during happy hour of course!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Phoenix.  Always delicious.  Happy hours are great."}
{"text":"I thought that the sushi was just ok. There are other options within several miles that are much better. One of the most impressive things about the food, was the truly lovely presentation. The servers were skilled and the happy hour was a very good deal so coming to here certainly isn't a waste, however there is tastier sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time.   We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!  My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona a year ago with my boyfriend. We love small sushi places and couldn't find one until we ate here. If you go during happy hour it is really cheap and delicous!! We go all the time now and are never unhappy! :)"}
{"text":"The sushi here is always fresh and taste great. Service is always good and fast. Happy hour is one of the best around! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I am not a sushi eater but all my friends were meeting here, so I thought, I'm in the mood for teryaki chicken so I'll try it out!    I ended up ordering the teryaki chicken roll which had crab it in. Let me tell you, I really enjoyed the mix of something familiar (teryaki chicken) with something new, crab.   The servers were very friendly and funny. They have a good happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Ive tried plenty of different sushi places and this is absolutely my favorite. I have never been dissapointed. I have taken many of my friends and family here, and they have all loved it. :)"}
{"text":"2nd experience was just awful. Now I went there before with a couple of friends. The experience was awesome and the waiter was always there. He was just great. That was in April 2013. Later on August 2013 I went there with a friend, the service was REALLY bad. This middle age waitress & younger waiter were either afraid of us or didn't want to bother with Black ppl. When I tell you our service felt like a distance. It REALLY did. The waitress was lost in translation half of the time,( ex. \" do you have unsweetened tea?\" No, we have sweet tea\" my friend wanted sweet tea. \" oh I want some sweet tea.\" \"No we only have unsweetened tea.\" ( didn't I just ask if she had unsweetened tea?)  we had to keep flagging them down for assistance...and she couldn't even split the bill right. The guy waiter was a nervous wreck and wouldn't look at us either... We left feeling unsatisfied & still hungry. So we got a nice meal at Chills for 25$"}
{"text":"We love Yen's the food is always good and the service is EXCELLENT!  Even when it is crazy busy they are always very attentive!  Everyone is SO friendly! The happy hour menu is a good deal and the house cold sake is YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a recommendation from my nephew.  The sushi was excellent!  We've been to quite a few sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, NY and elsewhere and this was was up there with the quality.  Very relaxed but nice atmosphere as well.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Me and my brother regularly prefer this place over any other sushi place on the west side. The sunset roll when they will make it is our favorite! Have tried most every sashimi and roll on the menu and i really enjoy the non sushi such as the udon noodle with curry. Great service and great atmosphere really a chill spot to enjoy great food."}
{"text":"This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars."}
{"text":"I read great things about Yen and checked it out today for a business lunch. The service was amazing, it's easy to have a quick lunch there, and they have cheap sushi lunch specials, but I was there for a business lunch, and we stayed for 2+ hours. The service was above and beyond excellent. The two ladies serving us were always on standby for whatever we needed, right down to spotting my friend drop his napkin and bringing him a new one before he even realized he dropped it.  The food was incredible. I had read about a scallop appetizer and meant to order that, but instead ordered the Mussels with Dynamite Sauce. What a wonderful mistake it turned out to be. There were six large mussels on the half shell, served hot with a savory Dynamite sauce, scallions and fish eggs. They were excellent. We decided to order several rolls, including the Hot Night roll, the Spicy Tuna Tempura (amazing tempura sweet potato comes with this), and several others, as well as a few pieces of sushi, including the Yellowtail belly, which was delicious and super fresh.   Since our eyes were way bigger than our stomachs, we had our server box up the remaining food and she was kind enough to put the box on ice for me to keep the fish cold! Without asking!!!! In hindsight, I wish I had asked her name so I could put it in this review and give her props. Highly recommended and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I can not stand this place during their reverse happy hour, 8-close. They are completely incapable of handling the large amount of customers that come in for this time. I have tried three times now, to visit Yen during this time, and have walked out after waiting 10-20 minutes to be spoken to, or seated. Try Fresh Wasabi 2 miles down the street, much better service, better happy hour, and better selection of fish (including yellow tail)."}
{"text":"I have been here perhaps 10 times in the last year and have had varying experiences. The first time I must say was great but several of my experiences thereafter were mediocre. Tonight the food was phenominal! Service was kind of what i expect at any sushi place, friendly but not over the top. I do believe sitting at the sushi bar is the way to go. The chef is awesome and i love the fact he put a couple of kids in their place when they hit the bar for their \"sake bombs\"! Hands down the best sushi in the area. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have found our sushi joint. Sapporo, Ah-So and all those crappy wannabe Japanese places in Scottsdale has NOTHING on this place. This is a hidden gem.   My husband and I came here on our anniversary which happened to be on Easter.  We came during dinner time and thought it was going to be a full house. It was busy, but not full. Lucky us!   We were seated promptly by our female server. She was very nice and helpful! I was very indecisive because almost everything on the menu sounded delicious! Anyway, we started off with Hana Sake raspberry flavor. It was definitely delicious. My appetizer came first and it was quick! I ordered the octopus salad and husband had the baked mussels. I LOVED both appetizers. I'm very picky about tako salads too! Portion was great and they were each both under $10! I requested my salad to be spicy and the chef made the spiciness up to my level. Bravo!   We shared sushi roll plate. It was the crunchy scallop roll with 2 spicy octopus sushi. Both were delicious as well. With the crunchy scallop, you get extra scallops on the side! Idk what sauce they used but it was godsend. Seriously. My taste buds level went over 9000. Hubby actually wanted to order the sea urchin sushi but they ran out that night. No biggie, we were full as heck anyway. Especially with that chocolate pyramid mousse with caramel.   While we were dining, one of the servers dropped a plate by the customer. Hey, things happen. It's life ya know? What surprises me is that the owner (I believe) immediately cleaned up and was very apologetic. They handled it well, unlike many places I go to. The atmosphere was VERY clean to a T. When you enter it's a bit cramped but the seating isn't.   We also tipped the sushi chefs on top of our server despite not sitting at the sushi bar. They worked hard and we were more than pleased with our food. Thank you guys! We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Been to many of the valleys \"fancy\" sushi spots- the w, pure, etc- this bar far has the freshest fish around.   Shockingly located in a strip mall off bell and the avenues this is a must come too place if you want anything fresh in phoenix! Do not let the curb appeal turn you away!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, and the customer service is awesome! You may not be used to the way things work though,  because most of the time you have to wave to them and let them know you are ready.  I like that because it gives me time to decide without someone checking on me every two minutes. I LOVE IT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried many sushi places in Arizona and every time I regret that I did not just come to Yen.   They have the best happy hour.  Beautiful interior, wonderful warm atmosphere with that pleasant noisy burble you want from a sushi place.   They somewhat recently added an addition to make it larger. Awesome and it is still always packed.   The fish is the best quality I've  found so far. Nice pink salmon, deeply pink-red tuna. Rice is perfect. Lots of selection and always excellent service.    This is the place to go.  Love love LOVE Yen."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I went today and sat outside, I went for happy hour and it was delicious... the happy hour menu it's freaking good. As I was done my baby woke up and she was hungry too, I asked for a side of the tempura veggies and they told me they only have the appetizer, later I found out they did a side just for me :)  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in Phoenix metro area and I've tried A LOT of them. Their Crazy Boy Roll is to die for. They are reasonably priced compared to some sushi places and have SO much to choose from. My 7 year old daughter even likes this place and she's super picky. My wife really really enjoys their curry bowls as well. Overall, the place is clean, friendly and never disappoints. 5+ STARS!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place right after we moved into the area and it's amazing! Everything we have tried is delicious. Staff is friendly and very prompt. It can be busy because of the happy hour but you'r never left feeling forgotten. Great atmosphere and just over all great restaurant. My husband and I will definitely continue going to rid restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This place was close to home so I would be here every other week or so. Good rolls and the staff was great!! Not much of a  selection for happy hour but the regular menu offers a variety of flavors."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for dinner and I gotta say this is probably the best sushi I've had in a long while. We ordered the fried gyoza for an appetizer, very delicious,   and then we ordered a rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a fried calamari tempura roll. What was really neat about the two tempura rolls was that it came out on the same plate and it also came with zucchini, sweet potato, and shrimp fried in tempura that was covered in a delicious sweet sauce. I've never received extra at other sushi restaurants like that and it definitely made for a great meal. I will definitely make more trips back to this location in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is nice and the service is great. The food is amazing and reasonably priced. I think this place is great if you love sushi but don't want to spend a fortune. Also they make good drinks, my gf especially loves the watermelon martini! So yeah, I definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and amazing service. My sushi is always delicious and they have good portions for fair prices.I haghky recommend their happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices! Better service could've given it 5 stars. Because I had a party of 6, it seemed that they relied solely on the courtesy 18% gratuity:( In fact, they we would've tipped much better had they tried harder (they completely forgot I ordered an app, maybe 1 round of refills on water and tea, not once did they ask how the food was). I've worked in the industry for many years in the past and always acknowledge good service and tip very generously when it's even \"normal\". Sad to see so many people doing less than minimum, thus I also have to acknowledge that too. Industry workers reading this: just try.... I promise it will not go unnoticed."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 0 if I could.    The service was awful and the food was worse.  Do not come here if you are looking for traditional sushi."}
{"text":"Best place in the Valley! Sunday happy hour is the best. Rolls are delicious and fun. great atmosphere. wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food here! The sushi is some of the best that I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have to admit that this was my favorite sushi restaurant in the Glendale area. Within the past two years, the service was always great. The food is good but on the very expensive side, in my opinion. I came today and the service was horrible. They wanted to charge me extra $5.00 just to switch out a different type of fish on their small trio-sashimi plate that's already $27. The waitress was rude and brought the check while we were still eating. Then another waiter just came straight to our table and grabbed our signed tip receipts while we were still there. I thought that was so rude of them to do that while the customers are still at the table. Have some respect and learn some American manners....please!!!! My other friends were there with me and they will definitely write many more bad reviews for this place!"}
{"text":"It was okay sushi but not great (but it's the only place I've tried in Phoenix.  Restaurant was nice inside (four stars there) and everyone was friendly, par for the course at a sushi place.  If the sushi was a little better it'd get an extra star from me."}
{"text":"I go to school right by this place and saw it on yelp a few times but I never got around to going. The other night after picking my girl up at the airport we were aimlessly driving around looking for food after what seemed like hours we settled on sushi and I decided to try Yen. Omg, I had no clue what I was missing! The food here is amazing! My girl ordered the cucumber salad and she said it was just ok. We got 4 rolls; a crunchy roll, 2 California rolls, and a Philly roll. They were all amazing! Before finding Yen we had been to Ra, Zen 32, and Koi but this place is by far the best! My only complaint is that it's too small and too many people know about it so be prepared to wait a while but it is definitely worth it!  Been back a few more times and my opinion has not changed; this place is amazing. without a doubt the best sushi bar in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!!! Service was speedy! Quite a few unique rolls to try here! Get here early on the weekends and it got quite busy for the dinner rush! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars from me as far as food concern. It's a little small though and these place is always busy especially if you go around lunch/dinner time. If you live in the West Side and looking for a good restaurant, check this place out. I usually get simple sashimi when I go to sushi restaurant like salmon sashimi and Yen have good salmon sashimi. The tempura rolls and Las Vegas rolls are good as well. For those who don't eat sushi but somehow get dragged to this restaurant, don't worry you have options. I recommend the Korean BBQ ribs. They are tasty and you get a lot of meat too.  **note review is based on my visits prior to my plant based diet**"}
{"text":"Prior to last night, I tried Uni (Sea Urchin) once before at a different Sushi place in California and it was terrible. Last night, I decided to give it one more chance @ our favorite sushi spot because I keep hearing how delicious good fresh and ice cold Uni can be. All I can say is holy moly! Yen Sushi & Sake Bar really knows what they are doing. The Uni was by far one of the best bites of sushi I have ever had. Great work Paul!!!! Any time we want sushi, we go to Yen!!!"}
{"text":"ALL TIME BEST \"Hole in the Wall\" Restaurant you'll ever find!!  I've been going here for a few years now and have never been disappointed.  We recently moved to the other side of town so don't get to dine here that often anymore, and I couldn't be more sad about it.    The prices are always good, but during happy hour they are phenomenal!  They do a reverse happy hour also from 8pm-close which is convenient for those of us who work during typical happy hour times.  The sushi chefs are authentic and you can watch them make all the food too.  The only cons about this place are: 1) It can get very busy during happy hour times and on weekends and the wait time can be pretty long.  2)  The location is pretty small/cramped and does not have much room for many people with limited tables, which causes the long wait times.  NOT a good place for groups over 4 people as there is just not enough room for it.  I'd love to see them grow and get a larger space to accommodate more patrons.  I have recommended many people here and have heard nothing but positive things from each of them.  FYI - the Philadelphia Roll here is perfection!"}
{"text":"been going there for years EXCELLENT sushi, always served very fast, people are friendly, excellent happy hours, its a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place but now im pissed horrible service! Just tried to call in an order a whole hour before they closed on a Friday by the way you should expect it to be busy dumb asses! We called for 30 minutes straight and they kept hanging up and not answering on purpose! We had a small order and like I said a whole hour are you kidding me thats ridiculous! Cant believe they would turn down business because they are too lazy to do their job also 10 is too early on a friday night anyway you guys have a bar for crying out loud!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with anything I have had here and probably will not return. The sushi rolls were small and left a sort of weird aftertaste in my mouth. Everything was just okay."}
{"text":"I've been going to yen for 5 years now. Best place in town for sushi! I have literally eaten everything on the menu and it is all great. Our personal favorites though are the sunset roll, the heart attack as an appetizer, the don't cry roll (spicy), and the rock and roll. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Really fresh sushi. Service can be hit or miss. Last time I went we had to ask twice for silverware and I actually had to get up and get my own napkins. They also brought us the wrong dessert. So you can't go wrong with the food, but you may go wrong with the service."}
{"text":"Yummy and Very Creative Menu ... Beautiful presentation..... Love this place!"}
{"text":"A bit small but a good place for a date. It was very clean ...might want to call before showing up on the count of how small it is. My mom dropped a cup and the whole restaurant went silent .If your looking for private and romantic  this isn't the place. A good place to have with friends the location is a bit under the radar but very close to ASU west. Decent price point (during happy hour) and you get a lot in my opinion compared to other places."}
{"text":"My friends and I usually come here for happy hour, which I think they are pretty much famous for.  Food are good, especially the crazy boy rolls.  I am not too much of an alcoholic, but I would recommend the sake bomber since you get more bang for your buck.  Another good thing about their happy hour menu is the cost.  You pay $5 for 1 roll.  Where else can you get a regular sized roll for only $5. I believe they have 2 times each day for their happy hours: 3-5p and 8-close."}
{"text":"It's just very average. If you are craving sushi and nearby it is worth going.   Pros: 1. Sushi is pretty tasty 2. Cute mom and pop (non-chain) restaurant  Cons: 1. The rolls and the sashimi are teeny tiny. Never had such small pieces. Felt ripped off for what I paid.  2. The waitress was miserable and obviously not happy to be there. Makes for a bad dining experience. It was like I was bothering her because I came in to order sushi.  3. Lots of tempura based rolls which could be a pro if you like fried rolls.   I will try others in the area before heading back here. Not bad but nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been driving by for a few months now after moving here thinking this was a tiny little take out sushi place.  After reading the awesome reviews on yelp and not having had sushi in a very long time I figured it was worth a shot. As soon as we walked through the door my husband said \"wow\".  A full service restaurant with a great atmosphere and decor surrounded us. The service was very attentive and thorough. The food was perfect in every way possible.  Beautiful presentation.  Exceptional flavors and textures.   We ordered the calamari crunch and fresh tuna with ponzura sauce as appetizers and then the fire cracker roll.  I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The sushi is actually some of the better we have ever had. In fact, most of their food is actually really tasty. The customer service has been atrocious and on two different occasions. The first time I stopped in here, I was sick and looking to get soup for my family. When inquired if they had any I could buy to go, the manager or owner (not sure) shouted at me in front of customers that I couldn't just order soup and it was a waste of time. I didn't go back for a year. My husband and I just recently went here. We arrived right before happy hour was ending and asked the waitress a question regarding the special. She had to ask someone else about the dish and left us at the table for 15 mins. When she finally came back and we placed our order, we were told we missed the happy hour special bc it was past the time (even tho she was the reason we couldn't order) and they couldn't help us out."}
{"text":"Quality sushi, friendly staff and took advantage with their happy hour specials.  Very happy about a full belly!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Great happy hour too. 3-6 and 8-close they have $5 rolls and cheap drinks. They have some unique sushi. My favorite is the heart attack! The environment is really nice too. You won't be disappointed by trying this one!!!"}
{"text":"Love there HH but so does everyone else so, it gets pretty packed. I have been on the look out for a good crunchy roll & the crazy boy roll is top of the top right now $5 at HH"}
{"text":"Yum. This place has amazing food. Eat here today. Leave now, you won't be disappointed. I came at the recommendation of several of my friends. I was not disappointed. But, I am mad at myself for not coming here sooner."}
{"text":"We tried them for the first time on Christmas Eve and enjoyed the food very much!  Awesome Vegas, Philadelphia, Spider Roll with California's on the side..."}
{"text":"Is it possible? Another 5 star review for a Sushi joint? Yes! Yes it is.   I was going to have dinner with my BFAM, Kevin and decided to look up Sushi. I chose Yen due to the great reviews and BOY was I glad that I did.  We were greeted and chose to sit at the sushi bar. I suggested to Kev that we go Chef's choice all the way. Of course my brother said \"Hell yeah\" to that! The Chef was mildly surprised at the request but quickly warmed up to the idea. If he was aiming to blow our socks off, he was dead on.  There is something about simply made, FRESH food that tends to wow me. He started us off with a sashimi plate to die for. It included salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and octopus. Amazing. Every slice was fresh, not even a hint of being old. The best way to describe the after taste is \"Clean\", no fishiness or weird after taste. The chef then presented us with thinly sliced striped bass with fresh wasabe. Amazing... amazing! The slices of bass were so thin, you could see the plate underneath. The next thing we ordered was eel. Now, I'm usually not a fan of eel because it seems gritty or greasy to me. When we were served the eel, I was surprised to find nothing of the sort on my plate. It was delicious! The eel was crisp and flaky from the broiling.   The entire meal was great from start to finish. I can't wait to visit Yen again."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place, the service was great, the sushi was fantastic, and paul at the sushi bar was very friendly.  If you're looking for a new sushi place, this is it..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and myself are regular comers to Yen and have never had a bad experience. We are always greeted with welcoming service and sat almost immediately. Tonight we came in and there was a wait of 30 minutes, according to the hostess, which seemed normal due to 4 groups ahead of us. She then sat us down within less then 10 minutes making it seem like our seating and dinner was important. The food ordered was beyond exceptional, environment enjoyable, but the service was just okay. Our server was nice at first when we gave our order, but didn't seem to come back to our table often leading me to ask the worker cleaning the table next to us for extra napkins instead, and multiple refills. However the workers almost always give much recognition and respect to the customers and make sure unnecessary plates are taken. This place takes their cuisine serious and try to make sure all customers feel appreciated and luxuriate in their meal. Would highly recommend Yen Sushi to anyone who adores sushi, for a deal of a price."}
{"text":"If you want sushi this is the place. Hands down the best mom and pop shop for sushi. You have to try the crazy boy roll it's my all time favorite roll. Staff is friendly and just a great vibe from the moment you walk through the door. Try this place you will not be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch stop for us, as we work for a company in the immediate vicinity. I was originally excited to see a sushi bar this close in our area. Over the course of a half dozen visits,  I've quickly come to realize the same issues as the recent posts I've seen below.  The service is certainly lacking. We are always waiting, missing items, incorrect orders, inconsistent cuts of sushi... Lunch is basically a grab bag of \"What's going to happen today?\".  Now, if you want to roll in and just get a bento box and roll out satisfied, this may be your place. Just don't go in with high expectations."}
{"text":"Since moving from NY I have hunted for a place that make great teriyaki chicken and sushi. This place fits the bill!!  We were in town visiting and we had to have eaten there a half a dozen times..."}
{"text":"We were extremely impressed with both the price and the quality offered here. The salmon and spicy tuna rolls were superb. Eel roll was good, the salmon skin rolls were amazing. The Rock & Roll was good, but pretty overpriced as you only get 5 pieces for $10.50  Excellent service, nice decor, and a lovely place to go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food is really good- the customer relations stink. We've been many times and always enjoyed the food, but the loud dance music, which is played even at lunch time, is clearly for the enjoyment of the employees. The last time we ate here, we asked to be seated away from the overhead speakers. Still, it was so loud we couldn't hear each other, so I eventually asked the waitress to turn the music down. She did, but right away one of the sushi chefs confronted her and angrily turned it back up! Won't ever be back. I'm really tired of restaurants playing music or t.v.s. Some of us actually talk over a meal."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say I'll be back.  We came in at 11:30 and right after we walked in two large groups arrived. So it seems to be a favorite lunch place for groups. The acoustics must be fantastic because with those groups it was still very quiet.  The lunch combo roll is a pretty good deal at $8.99.  This includes miso soup which is light and a nice bringing to the meal. Choice of California roll, spicy tuna or nigiri (1 each salmon, shrimp, tuna). I got the nigiri and all three pieces were delicious. All were fresh with no odd smell or texture. Then you also get another roll with about 6 choices of which I ordered the Alaska roll. Again it was delicious and fresh. The sauce (not sure what it's called) on the side of the plate was slightly sweet with a bit of spice.  So it's a pretty good deal for lunch.  Service was friendly and they weren't pushy or slow even with the three larger groups.  We plan on returning for happy hour at some point."}
{"text":"Yen is the go-to place for Sushi in Arizona. Having been to quite a few places and also living on the coast, I can say their fish is quality. The wait staff can vary, sometimes it's excellent, other times it's not. I enjoy their Albacore and Red Snapper sashimi and their off-the-menu King Crab hand roll (real crab, woot!). If you enjoy quality sashimi, this is an excellent place. If you're into all the fancy mayonnaise-based sushi rolls, you probably won't notice a difference."}
{"text":"Finally found a sushi place that's pushing the limits.  Great stuff going on here."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi! Happy hour is the best time to go. The service could be a little better."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are not a sushi fans, so you may think it is odd for us to go to a place like this; however, we have freinds who are fans so we had to find a place that balanced out well for both of us. AND LET ME TELL YOU, this place is amazing. They loved the sushi, my mouth waters whenever I think of the teriyaki and my hubby is always willing to go back and try something g else from them."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and salmon sashimi, very impressed. Try the Fresh salmon on Spicy Scallop Roll."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. The servers used to all know me. It's been awhile since I have been here (the extra space added is nice!) but service has gone down hill! I went for happy hour/lunch so it wasn't very busy. I had to ask two different waitresses twice each for my drink. My waitress seemed more annoyed than anything that I was there and wanting service, and it's not even like I asked for much. The food was ok, but that's the usual they've never been the best. It just used to be a nice place to go especially for their reverse happy hour. With service like that I don't know. We'll give it another try I guess since they used to be decent, hopefully just an off day for her."}
{"text":"Ive been trying a couple different sushi places and i think for the price and taste this is the best ive had thus far.  if you go during happy hour you wont regret it.  me my brother and my 2 cuzns pig out here and i mean pig out for about 60 bucks."}
{"text":"I had the udon and a Phoenix roll.   My Phoenix roll wasn't bad.. but not anything I'd ever get again.  This place was sub par.   Udon was okay. For some reason the broth was a little sweet?   Everyone at the table couldn't understand how this place had a 4 star rating when it should be more like a 2.5  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some sushi on our way back to Tucson. We chose this place because it was one of the only sushi places with a patio that allowed dogs. Service was ok. There were a few points when I wished they would refill drinks. I think it may have been different if we had been sitting inside.  Food was great! We had a group of 5 and we all order sushi and shared. The spicy rolls actually had a good kick to them. The rolls all tasted fresh. Of all of them my favorite was the spicy scallop roll. I would definitely come back if I was in the area again!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and happy hour, favorite rolls are the baked scallop and the Philadelphia roll! Atmosphere awesome and staff is too legit to quit!"}
{"text":"This place kicks! Have never had a bad meal here or bad service. Sushi rolls are always fresh. The best is they have reverse happy hour from 8PM to Close with a nice selection of discounted rolls and beers."}
{"text":"Their sushi is really good.  We got the Hawaiian roll with the seered albacore tuna.  The flavor was really good and held up to the wasabi.  The warm baked salmon roll with sour cream was even better.  Teriyaki roll was just okay.  The service was just plain bad.  When you only order 3 dishes and all you have to do is take an order and deliver one dish for each person.  What do you do on your free time?  Surely not forget my miso soup and forget to give me my wasabi.  There were a total of 4 tables to attend to for 2 waitresses.  I had to tell the waitress about refilling my tea and bringing my wasabi midway through my dish when I could not stand being thirsty.  The older lady got sounded agitated when I asked her about the soy paper for some strange reason and said it was an extra dollar.  I told her I was just wondering...jeez!  Nevertheless, they did not deserve any tip, but we did tip around 7%.  We are ordering take out from now on.  They have good food and this latest visit was just bad compared to other previous mediocre visits."}
{"text":"My friend had taken me here, i have been to plenty of sushi bars and restaurants, but this one is special, this one is the best.   First off, the prices. They are unreal fair. When i looked at the tab, I actually said, that's not bad at all.   But more than that, the sushi is simply amazing, my unagi plate presentation was crazy, served on a sizzling plate, it defiantly had the whole restaurant staring. The crunchy tuna roll was fantastic along with the sashimi.  If you have friends that don't like sushi and have never tried it, take them here, it will make them think twice!"}
{"text":"Yen is a fantastic choice for anyone needing their sushi fix. That's the best thing going for them, their food. Hands down the best eel I've ever had in town and close to the best oyster shooters I've taken. The green muscles are hands down the best appetizer I've had in any sushi joint. The chefs behind the bar are also very friendly and don't mind drunken people talking their ear off while working. The only problem with yen is that its really only worthwhile during the happy hour's they have and at that time it's almost impossible to get a seat without waiting and don't even try to get to the bar during those times. So your forced to sit at a table and be waited on by sub-par waitresses. Out of the 20 or so times I've been there I've had great service maybe 3 times at a table. Slow on refills and even refusing to split a check for my party on numerous occasions. But you take the good with the bad and I would recommend this place over any huge sushi restaurant with flash any day."}
{"text":"Ok.  So you had a rough week.  It's Friday night.  You are in the mood for some great sushi, but not looking forward to hurting the pocket.  And BOOM!  You hear Yen Sushi & Sake Bar has an AMAZING happy hour deal after 8 pm.  I mean cheap appetizers, about half off on sushi, and great prices on drinks.  All I am going to say is for a party of 4, we had:  2 appetizers 6 rolls of sushi 2 specialty drinks for the ladies 2 sake and beers for the dudes  Total amount came to $62!  Ok, with your mouth dropping, and thinking, \"the food probably wasn't that good, right?\"  Well, you have to be wrong, my fellow yelper.  The appetizer tempura was not overly breaded, and you can really taste the vegetables with the light crunch from the tempura.  The gyoza had some rough texture on some, but when bitten it was tender and flavorful.  Now to the sushi.  For the price, it was above average.  Well organized and presented.  Tasted fresh, therefore, it was some quality sushi.  As a result, great deal for happy hour, which I will definitely come back to.  It is a small environment in not the best looking shopping center.  However, the service was good even though it was definitely busy.  I would strongly recommend coming 10-15 minutes before happy hour to beat the line.  Excellent DEAL, and looking forward to another evening at Yen Sushi & Sake Bar!"}
{"text":"Another Sushi bar run by friendly Koreans. This one though, is a step above the others.  The chef (and owner I think) Paul, was incredibly friendly and explained how he uses only quality ingredients - especially in the reasonably priced and delicious small sashimi platter ($27). You can tell that quality is important to Chef Paul.  The Happy Hour specials (every day 3-5pm) keep bringing us back for the $5 rolls - Salmon and Shrimp rolls and $3 large Sapporo are our favorites.  We also tried the baked scallop cheese appetizer ($8)and it was simply sinful."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in town. They have a awesome happy hour too. I try to eat here 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"Sushi that leaves an impression and that's what's getting 5 stars. It's just good and the staff is nice.  Prices are reasonable for happy hour and the space is decent. Usually the main room is filled and often it spills over into their additional space. So don't be discouraged by the groups of people entering in front of you. It's a tight squeeze but there's always a table somewhere."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite sushi bar in Phoenix. I've lived all most Asian countries including Japan so I believe I have a well rounded insight into quality Japanese cuisine.   This place has really gone downhill in the last few months. The servers and the sushi chef must have had a horrible day because I was largely ignored by the waitress and the sushi chef cut the sashimi portions in half. I was a regular there and at each visit, the size of sashimi slices kept getting smaller and smaller. During my last visit, the fish slices were wafer thin. To make matters worse since I was ignored by the waitress, I confronted the sushi chef and showed him how he used to prepare my sashimi deluxe platter and what he actually made me. The sashimi was literally dumped on my plate and was lacking the usual beautiful presentation. His response was that he was busy and that we had a large table. I told him this was unacceptable and he proceeded to give me this idiotic \"Alfred E Neuman\" look.   The server never gave me my sake without me chasing her down and she also forgot to give me my side order of rice. This server never smiled once.   I will never, EVER go back to his place. It doesn't matter if you're a regular, they'll still treat you like crap!  And by the way, if you're in a group, be wary of the 20% gratuity that is added to your check. Most ppl don't notice this. My service was so bad that I asked for my 20% back and told them to shove it and left."}
{"text":"Crunchy Spicy Tuna!!! Oh so Delicious!  I underestimated Arizona....This place was just awesome!  They have the best happy hour I have seen even in LA. $5.00 beers and $5.00 sushi 8pm-close. Yup we closed the place.   It a small little whole in the wall restaurant that is located in a shopping center next to a subway.  We arrived here after our 7 hour Drive from LA to AZ. The place closed at 10...i think, but we arrived at 11:15 and they still let us order food and beer! YAY Even after we were done....they let us order dessert! Excellent Service and Awesome Staff.   Oh Yen Sushi...You had me at Hello...."}
{"text":"Great lunch sushi special: Two rolls (spicy tuna + one from a separate list) + miso soup for $9.  I came here with my brother and sister for lunch after we had gone carting nearby. The service was excellent and we all ordered the lunch sushi special. Spicy tuna roll was sooo good. Fortunately, my brother couldn't finish his, and I obviously couldn't let it go to waste! lol! ;P  I also had the yellowtail/scallion roll which was fresh and delicious as well. For appetizers, we got the cucumber salad and squid salad. Both huge portions (especially the squid salad) and tasty!  They had a pretty extensive menu with lots of other rolls. Mmm...will have to come back here next time I'm in PHX."}
{"text":"Great food, but, there is always a butt... Service was strangely strange.. Servers were friendly enough, but, inconsistent."}
{"text":"Hella good! The happy hour prices are great and the rolls aren't skimpy! The service is pretty good too. I enjoyed this better than Fresh Wasabi."}
{"text":"Although my local Yen Sushi is now long gone out in Los Angeles, I was happy to see Yen in Phoenix while I was visiting. I popped in around 3:30 in the afternoon, hoping their happy hour was in effect, and it definitely was. The happy hour sushi menu is a little more spartan than the one I remember from Los Angeles, but the good stuff was on here and I was happy. At $5 a roll, you can't really go wrong... and I was starving. I snagged a crispy tuna, tempura shrimp, and a chili crab roll. Everything was fantastic, and prepared well.   The chili crab was the star of the show. It came out piled high with lightly tempura battered jalapeno slices. The entire plate was a mound of crunchy, tasty little jalapenos with a crab roll underneath. I sat and ate the whole plate of chillies one by one when the rest of my meal was done. They were delicious. Sure, that might seem sadistic to some, but they were pretty tame on the heat, and really over the top with flavor.   Great meal. Just what I was looking for, and perfect to combat an entire day of driving through the desert. Oh, and the waitstaff was on point. Very attentive, very friendly, and made sure I was well taken care of. Thanks, Yen."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  I would write a longer review, but I'm busy having the best sushi in the valley. This place had good reviews, so we tried it. I'm so glad we did!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place! Been here over 25 times and it always satisfies. Favorite waitress Yuri is always providing excellent service! Happy hour is the time to go 3-5 and 8-close, believe me your bill will be half the price of what it would normally be.   5 star all day! New waitresses are a little bitchy but the food is so good I guess I'll deal with the occasional eye roll when I ask for a refill. I need to figure out Yuri's schedule because she never fails to provide outstanding service!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and have had great food AND great service both times.  Have not been during happy hour, but left around when it was starting and there was a line out the door.  It's a very small but clean and nicely decorated sushi bar.  Not a big fan of the raw stuff, but have tried some of their specialty baked rolls and they are delicious.  My favorite is the Teriyaki chicken roll and the heart attack.  They only serve soda in a can, which is the only negative I found in this small little strip mall Sushi bar!  So go try it!"}
{"text":"Great service. Thank you Jasmine. You made our night! Thank you!    Yet another night here and the fabulous Jasmine and baby boy, sorry don't know his name.  Love this place.  Love the Jasmin  Another great night.  Got our favorite server Jasmine. Happy hour rocks too. Sorry Jas I can't figure out how to post our picture!"}
{"text":"Yet another disappointing sushi restaurant in the desert. My date and I went here for their late happy hour on a Friday night. I noticed it was hard for larger parties to get a table. There isn't much space between tables. I played it safe and ordered a plate of salmon nigiri. I noticed there wasn't a large selection of raw fish. We ordered the peach soju and the spicy tuna tempura off the happy hour menu. I thought I would be getting a peach soju that's of a thicker substance, but it ended up being soju mixed with some peach sweetener that killed the alcohol. Maybe it was my mistake of ordering soju at a sushi joint. The spicy tuna tempura was a spicy tempura roll deep fried in tempura batter and then sauces drizzled all over each piece that was cut. I couldn't taste any kind of kick from the roll. STAY AWAY from the happy hour rolls.   What i think might be helpful is describing what's in each roll, rather than listing all the rolls on a sheet of paper for you to choose and its quantity. I'm so used to going to sushi restaurants that give you free miso soup, salad, and gyoza. These tend to be the cheapest items on the menu to prepare. Giving these out might keep customers coming back.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"I am giving this a review keeping in mind what this place is: a charming little sushi restaurant wedged into a strip mall in an older Phoenix neighborhood.  I have tried to come here and been dissuaded by a wait for seating in the past. This place is smaller - in a cozy way - and there is a reason it is full.  Reverse happy hour specials, great service, generous portions, and high quality rolls make it a place worth visiting again!  You will forget that you are in a strip mall once you are seated. Our server was attentive to the happy hour sake bombs and wine, and the guests (lots of younger people) were definitely happy to take advantage of this.  Much of the happy hour rolls consisted of tempura rolls - not my favorite - but the price was good and everything was fresh. We ordered a Phoenix roll (written on a board as a \"special\") and that, along with the quail eggs, were the highlight of the meal.  Don't be afraid to venture off the happy hour menu and try some amazing work-of-art rolls!  I can see coming here again - happy hour or not - and venturing outside my box. There was not a single thing we ordered that wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Ambiance and layout of restaurant is small and pretty chill. Happy hour goes from 8pm to close which means sake bombers for 5 bucks, philli and a couple other rolls for 5 bucks, and some other specials for good pricing. Again, four stars because of a lack of that \"blow my socks off\" x factor"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty decent for what you pay for (given that it's no high end sushi like Roka Akor) but then I always believed you usually get what you pay for. The line however is ridiculous, especially if you are trying to catch their \"happy hour\" special. For me, the menu items were better than the happy hour if you are willing to pay just a little bit more. Service is also a little lacking. But having been in AZ for the past couple months, I've grown to loosen up my Los Angeles standards."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for work lunch and must say, the first impression was not bad.   I am glad that there is a decent sushi place by my work.   Service was really good, food was good, and I am planning to go back for sure. I ordered their bento box and I was impressed as it does come with a lot of food. Besides sushi, my favorite item out of the box was their tempura vegetables.   One ting I did not like is how cold it was in there. I was shivering the entire time. When I go back, I will bring a blanket :-)"}
{"text":"I went there during happy hour, and tried all kinds of things off the menu, they were all good , and the service was good as well. Nice place to go for sushi."}
{"text":"This place is kind of dark, but I think that's what makes it a good place to get sake (convenient if you get asian glow). We didn't get any sake on this visit, but it says $5 sake bombs during happy hour. Therefore, I would definitely come back during happy hour because the rolls can get pretty expensive here. I got the Spicy Scallop & Salmon Roll ($11.95). The salmon was fresh and the roll was good, it was just so darn expensive! I wanted to try the seaweed salad as well, but as I was ordering I realized it was $8 so hastily changed to edamame for $3. All in all, a good place to come to happy hour with friends. Lots of tables (with cushions) and seats at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"2nd favorite sushi spot on the north side.  Yen is on the NE corner of 43rd Ave and Bell.  It is in a strip mall (what else in AZ).  The inside is pretty small.  Maybe sits 8 at the sushi bar and another 25 inside.  There are a few tables on the \"patio\" as well.  It's not much of a patio.  A barred off small section right out front.  The inside is quaint and nice.  There are a few TVs and a wall of bottles behind the sushi chefs.  It can get rather loud with conversation inside but it reminds me of a crowded local spot in NY more than a typical sad empty AZ restaurant.  We were seated very quickly after they cleaned a table off.  One of the worst ways to welcome a customer is with a wet table.  I am glad you cleaned the table from the previous guest but I am not happy to put my hands and arms on a wet table that was cleaned with a rag that may have been dropped on the floor or used on 20 other tables.  That is just disgusting to me and inexcusable to do.  Take the extra 30 seconds and a clean dry towel and clean it off properly before you seat a customer.  I used a napkin and requested another.  Very poor form.  We first ordered drinks.  I'm a big beer connoisseur and was a little disappointed in their Japanese beer selection.  The usual suspects were on the menu: Sapporo, Ashahi, Kirin Ichiban.  Basically the Bud Light of Japan.  I was hoping for some Koshihikari Echigo or Orion but beggars cant be choosers on the NW of PHX.    We ordered a couple of apps: Edamame and Tofu with Yuzu sauce.  The edamame was a bit cold and not very fresh.  The tofu with Yuzu sauce was pretty tasty.  The tofu was covered in bonito flake which I love and sprinkled with green onion.  The sauce was delicious.  I would have liked an extra pour all over it.  The tofu was good but would have been better if it was a little softer.  It would have soaked up the sauce more if it had been.  Next we ordered tuna sashimi, a phili roll, a dragon roll, and a teriyaki chicken bowl.  The tuna was very fresh and absolutely delicious.  Melted on your tongue and was pure as tuna Ive had in this town.  The phili roll was a bit much for me.  All I could taste was cream cheese but in fairness I am not a fan of phili rolls in general.  The dragon roll was out of this world.  It was about 2 inches thick in diameter.  The eel was the larges slice of eel I have ever been served on a roll before.  The crunchy shrimp inside with the sweetness of the eel sauce around was amazing.  Definitely the highlight of my meal.  The teriyaki chicken was also very good.  Tender flavorful and fresh.  Loved it.  The waitress would disappear for a bit but you can tell she was very busy.  The place was packed and there were only two of them and they were busting their backs pretty well.  I would definitely come back here again thanks to the yuzu sauce with bonito flakes, dragon roll, tuna, and teriyaki chicken.    It would make them pretty close to a 5 in my book if they didnt seat you at a wet table, added a couple gems to their beer selection, and made the tofu a tad bit creamier.  Looking forward to trying out other items.  If you are nearby and looking for sushi look no further!"}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to try new Sushi restaurants, but because this was right by the house I used to live in at the time, I decided to check it out.  First, their to go menu is like a CD booklet.  Full pictures, full color, fully AMAZING.  I don't know if they still give these out, but if so, grab one.  Second, sit at the bar.  Don't eff around and sit at a table hidden in the back.  You lack the action of the frontal plain and you miss out on the opportunity to meet new people and possibly get the hook up on free samples.  Third, Paul, the main chef, is awesome!  He is always very friendly, very personable, and has many interesting stories.  One time I went in here for lunch and he helped me learn to use chops sticks (I know, this is SO embarrassing and pathetic on my behalf, especially considering the amount of sushi I eat, but somehow I blame it on being a lefty).  Although I was not able to master the technique he provided, I will never forget the personal attention he gave to us.  Fourth, the food.  Well, it's obviously delicious otherwise I wouldn't have rated it as such.  I know that certain fish cuts are seasonal, but I seem to be slightly disappointed when Toro is not available, and it is rarely available here.  Their Yellowtail Sashimi is wonderful.  I guess I can't really pick a favorite, but they do have a large selection of rolls available.  Fifth, ambiance.  Dark, quaint, I love the wall paper behind the bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The Palm Spring roll and Calamari Tempura roll are my favorites. The ambiance is nice to. They have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Love this place! Will drive out of my way, personally best sushi place I've been too. Been coming for years, happy they expanded their dining room.  Smells a little weird, service is whatever, but food is SO worth it. Pretty sure owner is actually Japanese."}
{"text":"Holy Mackeral. Dare I say this is the best sushi place that I've tried so far...even though I'm from the Bay area, even though this is Glendale? Yes!  I'm going to make a list so it's an easier break-down:  1. Instant I come in I get greeted by Japanese (yes, Japanese speaking sushi chefs from behind the sushi bar). (GASP!).. Rarely seen, I know. You know the fish and sushi is fresh and authentic when you have native tongue working here. Big thumbs up for the fresh fish is displayed behind the counter in glass, showing the chefs making it in front of you (which I miss!) Very authentic Japanese dishware and furniture throughout.  2. Very attentive, non-obtrusive waitresses and hostess. Paid attention to the amount of food I was ordering (apparently way too much), and suggested appropriately.  3. Bento box (salmon, rice, tempura, miso soup,california rolls) for only $7.99? I remember the last time I ordered this is Cali, it was $10+. This must be wrong...can it  possibly be this cheap AND good? It was ridiculous delicious. The sweet, flakey salmon that melted in my mouth paired so well with the rice, with bits of sesame. I'm in heaven. Only thing I would change is just to make the porportions a tad bigger..  3. Ambiance has modern music, to a low level, not disturbing or loud. Fresh and clean scent throughout the place, didn't reek or raw tuna or over-powering teryaki sauce. Great AC when it starts getting warm outside.  4. For dessert: Green tea icecream for just $3? Great!! Oishii..  They actually said good-bye to me AND smiled? Wow, reminds me of San Jose, CA. Left here with a full stomach, wallet, and a great friday to look forward to."}
{"text":"It wasn't that good.  The fish didn't at all seem fresh.  I think it was frozen and subsequently thawed.  Hmmm.  Maybe just a bad visit.  But I'm surprised at all the positive reviews."}
{"text":"I want to say this is probably the greatest sushi spot I've ever had. The staff is fantastic always coming to you asking if you need anything. The sushi was fantastic the flavors. The worker helped me out choosing what to get. Whoever wants a good sushi spot I recommend this place over any other place. Also happy hour 3-5 is amazing."}
{"text":"Looks like I have to agree with my friend Deb L.  I too wanted to like Yen since it's pretty close and I really got excited about all the positive reviews.  Though, sorry Deb-I don't mind cans of pop :) So, I have their spicy pork bento box and my buddy had a couple rolls.  The rolls were a disappointment I could tell, just not quite what she's used to.  She also complained about an immediate potty trip upon arriving home, despite my explaining it's impossible for food to travel through your digestive system in a half hour.... I had the spicy pork bento, I don't think I left quite as disappointed but I'd call the pork oily before I called it spicy.  The usual accompaniments (miso, salad, etc.) were pretty blah I thought.  And I do agree it's pricey especially considering the mostly abandoned strip mall location across from a Whataburger..."}
{"text":"Dishes ordered were worth the price. Restaurant is clean and inviting. Service is just okay."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. The sushi was ok nothing great. The waitress barely spoke a word to us. Came with our check after we only ordered 3 rolls to split and didn't even ask us if we were done. We weren't. But we are now."}
{"text":"Yen is a place of quality for me when it comes to sushi. I am never disappointed by the freshness and quality of the sashimi. Also when I do go for the sushi rolls, I get their crazy boy roll which is a tempura California roll amazing!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been here twice, and loved both trips. The food, prices and service are consistently good."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in Arizona! Happy hour at 8 pm every day! $5 sushi rolls!!!! Count me in!"}
{"text":"A cozy little gem of sushi restaurant in a strip mall. Felt comfy from the moment my hubby and I walked through the door and sat at table on a Monday night. Nice selection of sushi named in the menu, reasonable prices, very fresh fish, great quality, quick and attentive service and super tasty! Just had the basic scallop sashimi, volcano roll and shrimp with crab in soy paper roll. We enjoyed our meal immensely. Great selection of sake available as well. We will be back and be sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Good food.. Lunch special till 3 happy hour 3-6.. Gyoza were excellent, teriyaki beef good,  sushi was to spicy for my sons liking but became a prefect take hm for family.. No free refills on soda..they don't tell you that. Clean modern  will try again. The waitress was not friendly but wasn't rude either.  I'll update if we end up going back."}
{"text":"Udon noodles soup is great on a cold day. Sushi is pretty good. Rice could have used a few more minutes cooking but good over all.  Nice place for a fast lunch with excellent and prompt service."}
{"text":"Yen Sushi offers great bento boxes for lunch at $8.99. Choose from beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, Korean Kalbi ribs and a couple of other choices. They even offer a sushi roll bento.  We ordered a beef teriyaki bento, salmon teriyaki bento and a sushi roll deal.   Beef teriyaki: Miso soup with a good amount of tofu, ginger salad with a large wedge of tomato, carrot and zuchini tempura with sauce (no shredded radish), 4 pieces of California roll, rice and bulgogi marinated beef with a dash of teriyaki.  Salmon teriyaki: Same fixings as above. They portion of salmon was on the larger side. Nice grill, but chef was a little heavy handed on the soya sauce which took away from the teriyak marinate.  Sushi roll meal: No ginger salad. I chose 3 pieces of nigiri instead of the california roll or spicy tuna roll. For my specialty roll, I chose yellowtail tuna with scallions. The rolls was fresh and delicious.  My favorite part of the meal was the soft shell crab roll for $9.95. It was pretty, crunchy and tasty. The finishing sauce was a perfect amount.  Our server was friendly, and we enjoyed the meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Went here today; service was  all over the place. We got our sushi first, miso soup second and appetizers last. Be cautious; spicy tuna is my staple but they use bone scrape tuna and that is low grade, gross tuna flake meat scrubbed of the bones. The king crab came out half filled with rice and it was $6.50. Don't cut corners and jip customers. We won't be back, there are better quality places around the valley."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. The sushi is always fresh and presented nicely. You must try the grilled bbq shorts ribs, so delicious. We also love the flavored soju."}
{"text":"Yen is amazing! Great happy hour, great service and great quality of food compared to any sushi place I've been and for such a cheap price! Recommend this place to anyone who wants sushi! None compare!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Food was wonderful!!! Half ass service acted liked she was annoyed taking orders. Walked away halfway between our drink orders. Had to re order drinks for half our party. Told her we were ordering more food, she still brought the receipt. Got mad and wadded the receipt up when we ordered more food. Great food but terrible, terrible service... Straight up amateur hour service!!! Next time I'll go where they appreciate us as customers!!! Food was amazing so they get a 3!!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for my lunch break. They have awesome customer service! The girls already recognize me because I'm always there! Their crazy boy roll is amazing! As well as their veggie roll. They are fast even during lunch hour where it gets pretty packed. They've never messed up on an order and they are checking occasionally to see if you need anything else. It's a must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I think this place is way overrated for the food and service. The best thing I had was the stir-fried curry udon noodles. The dishes I had with fish were nothing special. Sashimi pieces were cut very small and were a little fishy. Only a few items are on the happy hour menu, and they're probably not the good ones you'd want to try anyways."}
{"text":"My very last supper in Phoenix was at Yen Sushi & Sake, omakase all the way. The experience at Yen is top-notch and the staff is on point. Typically if everyone is doing chef's choice, you share all the plates, but in an inspired twist, Chef presented us with individual plates of sashimi. Filled.to.the.brim. Holy cow, this could have been a meal in and of itself, loaded down with octopus, ahi tuna, albacore, salmon so fresh and fatty it melted like butter in my mouth, and two other cuts I can't remember. SO MUCH SASHIMI! Then our table was hit with five more plates of rolls, one right after the other, including the cucumber lollipops, the heart attack, a little tempura, etc. We chowed on all of it, audibly moaning and pointing at things while trying to wrap our mouths around gigantic roll slices.  Best sushi in the Valley, what more could I possibly say?"}
{"text":"Professional and customer service oriented. This is one of our favorite places to eat. The food is excellent and the chefs are top notch!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and I dont just mean saki bombs!....no really!..this is real authentic sushi .. I will most certainly return here especially during happy hour"}
{"text":"I was referred by a friend! Sushi was clean and decent. Our server was a bit absent, also seemed only interested in us if we were ordering more food. Solid happy hour, but everything on happy hour (90%) is fried. It was average. Not bad."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend recently, and cannot wait to go back!  For a nondescript storefront in a forgettable plaza, Yen Sushi & Sake Bar is both charming and memorable.  This is a small location--no more than two dozen tables, plus additional seating at the sushi bar, but it is beautifully decorated and well-staffed.  The menu is a small book!  It took my dining companion and I more than a few minutes to decide on our rolls for the evening.  Based on our experiences with other sushi bars, we each ordered two rolls--he the chicken teriyaki roll and one more 'traditional' roll that I cannot remember, me the veggie roll and the veggie tempura roll.  Soda was served by the can, but was well-chilled and served with a glass of ice.  We were each brought a cup of miso soup to start.  The rolls were well-timed, arriving just as we finished our soup.  There was a LOT of food!  The traditional rolls were large enough, but the chicken teriyaki and veggie tempura rolls each came with a side of what they were made with!  Those rolls alone would have made for a meal.  Quality of the food was excellent.  The veggie tempura roll was warm, all of the ingredients were fresh, and there was no discernible \"fishy\" flavor that sometimes plagues the seaweed at other restaurants.    The extensive selection of speciality rolls are really where Yen Sushi & Sake Bar shines, and we can't wait to go back and sample some more.  Prices are reasonable; roughly in line what one would expect to pay for sushi outside of Scottsdale.  A must-visit for any sushi fan!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay (on happy hour), this place is amazing! I've never eaten so much Sushi/Tempura with $20. Their happy hour is top notch.  Service is good, and the ambiance is great. I made it my new years resolution to come here once a month. So far, unlike my workout resolution, I've been sticking to it."}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have found a pretty good sushi restaurant that is somewhat close to our neighborhood!  We were welcomed and seated promptly!  Waters were brought very quickly, along with a Kirin and Sochu!  Even the sushi was pretty fast.  The first thing that came out was our salmon sashimi!  I looked great, the slices were of good size, and was super fresh!  Great start!  Then we received our order of Heart Attack.  Tempura fried fresh jalapeno stuffed with crab, spicy tuna and cream cheese.  Again, another winner!  The next thing to come out was the Philly roll.  I must say that this is a different version than I'm used to, so was a little curious about if I'd like it or not.  Both my husband and I agreed that we liked it better than the standard traditional Philly roll.  The inside is cream cheese, cucumber and asparagus with the salmon on the outside.  Not only do you get more cream cheese this way, but also more salmon!  Definitely one we'd re-order again.  This was followed by the Spicy Tuna Crunchy roll.  Again, a different take on the typical spicy tuna roll.  This one didn't so much pay off.  Both my husband and I agreed that we like the traditional version, and would try to order it without the \"crunchy\" in the future.  While it wasn't bad by any means, it left a lot to be desired in terms of the freshness and spice you get from a traditional Spicy Tuna.  And we rounded out our sushi experience with the baked Scallop Roll.  Scallops and crab on top of a Cali roll, that it baked with some tasty sauces drizzled on top.  Reminds me of one of my favorite rolls that I always used to get before moving to Arizona, and have never found it anywhere since.  I must say that while it wasn't a duplicate of my favorite, it was pretty close and definitely tasty!  We will definitely be making Yen a repeat when we are wanting sushi!"}
{"text":"A weekly tradition.  We come here almost every week for the $5 Sake bombers and stay for the sushi. We're the loud people next to you banging the table to get the shotglass to drop into the beer.  The place is small but does have a patio, the food is always great but the service has been mixed. We've had everything from amazing service to almost none at all, but it can be forgiven because of the food and cheap bombers after 8pm  I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had Tuna Sashimi and Cali Roll for my basic measure of quality for sushi restaurants, because if ya can't pass on the basic roll then it's no good. Yen definitely passed my Cali Roll test, both items were delish. Atmosphere is calm, light music in background. Also tried the peach sparkling saki and it was refreshing. Staff was attentive but our waitress didn't stop by much, the other staff assisted us. Overall, the price was right, the food is great and I will definitely become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My friend and I travel quite a bit and we are reliant on Yelp for good restaurants. We are very particular about Sushi restaurants especially in AZ or anywhere there is no ocean border. So we need a restaurant that is at least 4 Stars and 100+ reviews.  OKAY, the neighborhood is not where I would just walk into a sushi spot, so thank you Yelp! It was very clean inside and the sushi chef welcomed us right away. Our service was GREAT. There were 3 servers and they all helped us and made sure we had what we needed. We ordered 4 types of rolls and they were all great and the food came out fast. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Quality at its best.  I suggest starting off with what I have featured, Tuna Tataki, Salmon, Spicey Tuna Handroll and a Large Asahi."}
{"text":"The food is great, happy hour is amazing! I just wish it was bigger as sometimes it fills up super quick."}
{"text":"The staff denied me seating because I had my service dog with me.  I tried to explain that he was a service animal and that the law prohibited service denial or discrimination, but they insisted they would only serve us on the patio.  This is the first time I have experienced this, and it was disappointing and embarrassing.   I will say that our waitress was apologetic about the situation and seemed to understand that it wasn't okay.  She ran back and forth a bunch of times making sure we had what we needed outside and I appreciated that.  Additionally, the food  was pretty good (sushi was fresh and my nephew liked his beef teriyaki bowl), so my stars would have been much higher had it not been for our initial \"welcome\" and seating experience."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi spots in the north west valley. The quality and taste are consistent along with the service. I love the green tea and recommend the tempura salmon roll, spicy tuna, and Vegas roll...just a couple of my favorites"}
{"text":"We LOVE coming here for the happy hour...amazing 5$ rolls! We always ask for Jasmine....she's so sweet and she ALWAYS provides great and personable service!"}
{"text":"7 years ago my husband took me on our first date here! Since it has expanded a bit, but has managed to keep it's small business charm. Always dimly lit with the cute Japanese news paper looking wallpaper. Always expect a wait for their 8-10pm happy hour Monday - Friday. And you can always expect good service and food. Yup... not much has changed. I would say they have become a little less popular with more and more decent sushi options popping up near by. But we always seem to find our way back to the good 'ol Happy Hour at Yen. You can not go wrong with the Crazy Boy Roll: A Deep Fried Jalapeno, stuffed with Crab Meat, and Drizzled with Eel Sauce. And of course everyone's simple go-to Roll, the Philadelphia Roll. And I think it goes with out saying that you have to get your $5 Saki Bomb and call it a night. That's how we do it anyway. We are lucky enough that this little is in Longboarding distance from our house. So sometimes I call it a night after 2 Saki Bombs... shhh..;)"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars for the sushi chefs at the sushi bar, they are really fast and the rolls are perfect! I do love the food here as well but the service needs a little work perhaps an attitude check with our first waitress we had.  We had a few others helping us who were somewhat pleasant. My friend just turned 21 and we wanted sake bombs and our first waitress was just plain out rude and unhelpful to us. We just wanted to have a nice dinner without having to feel like we were bothering anyone."}
{"text":"Yen has been my go to sushi spot for years now. The Happy Hour hours, although not convenient for everyone; works really well for many. They are in a great location just north of Bell, and the parking lot is tight, but there is plenty of space inside the restaurant since its expansion.  Their Philadelphia Roll is hands down the best in town. Don't be impatient when it comes to waiting for a table; it has exploded in popularity because of how delicious it is. Because it has gotten so big they do have new staff many of whom are younger, so be courteous and understanding if they aren't waiting in your beck and call. I will never stop going here."}
{"text":"Best place to get sushi in phoenix! They will have a half hour wait on the weekend but trust me- it is worth it! They usually have some exotic special of the day and it is always pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Spicy Pork and the Gyoza I had, but the rest of my party said the sushi they got was average at best.  This coupled with the empty drinks we had made us disappointed given the rating here on Yelp."}
{"text":"**This place is actually on 43rd Avenue just north of bell**    I stumbled upon this excellent establishment a few months ago while attempting to find a nearby cafe, and it has since become a weekly, if not twice a week, habit.  Their sushi is some of the better stuff I have had here in AZ, and definitely in Glendale.    What really keeps me coming back for more though, are their udon soups.  They have a tempura, a nabeyaki (With egg), and a plain version (I think, never ordered it), and all are hands down the best this side of California, and better than most I have tried there.  There are also other noodle dishes, and some more traditional dinner entrees to choose from.    To top it off, they have half off sake/beer and buy one get one half off sushi rolls during happy hour.  The only problem is that they are generally understaffed, so if it gets busy, things get hectic..."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. I love this place. Realistic prices and a very authentic atmosphere. You wk t be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and their happy hour is one of the better deals in the valley.  They have it often and it includes some good choices...a nice variety I should say.  My temperature test for any sushi joint is their spicy tuna and their's is pretty tasty.  I have found their seaweed to be a little chewy though so I try to get their rice paper rolls instead.    Whatever you do though...don't get their caramel pyramid dessert thingamajig!  It does NOT, I repeat, does NOT have a liquid caramel center!  I don't even want to try to describe it because I will start retching.  But it definitely tastes of freezer burn.  That is all."}
{"text":"So far the best sushi I've had on the west valley.  Just moved from Tempe and was way better than most places on that side of town as well.  Can't beat the happy hour, the only complaint would be how small the place is and it get's busy so the wait can be brutal when you're so close to such great sushi."}
{"text":"I read a few yelp reviews before checking this place out, and the high ratings are right-on! We had a few rolls, Shrimp Tempura, Salmon and Scallop, Crazy Kid, and Salmon Tempura to start. SO AMAZING.   We also had a Tempura appetizer.. I guess you could say that we like fried stuff a little. The veggies were crisp, the yams were cooked perfectly aslo (not soggy like I have had at other places), and the shrimp was obviously fresh.   I had one of the Udons, mine came with two delicious fishcakes, mushrooms (enoki maybe?), one tempura shrimp, and the perfect amount/type of seaweed. I have long loved Udon, but now I have a favorite in Phoenix for which to compare all others in the area.   My husband had the Terryaki Chicken and he didn't say a word while eating. This is a very good sign. When he doesn't like his food he talks about something to avoid eating it. He barely shared a bite with me. Even though I tasted an onion in my bite, it was savory nonetheless.   I am willing to bet that you will be elated by anything that you order on their menu. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"The other day my family and I dropped into Ah So and were treated poorly so we decided to eat at Yen's. The server Yuri and other staff were so friendly and welcoming. The food was amazing as usual and the atmosphere quiet and lovely even with a large group. The lunch special bento boxes were reasonably priced and the servings were filling. I highly recommend this place for lunch and happy hour, I don't think you will be sorry. Ask for Yuri she is just so sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot. I've been going for over four years and its always fabulous. Everything is fresh and tasty. My daughter (who is five) loves the octopus sashimi and the salmon roe. Do not miss the happy hour from 3-5 and 8-10. Get there early for happy hour, the place is packed by 8:30."}
{"text":"Ive been to Yen Sushi twice now and bith times they,ve impressed me! Great service, fast and courteous! Quality of food is stellar. They have happy hour prices from 3-5pm and after 8 pm daily. Haven't had a bad experience at all. Good atmosphere too! Loved it"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in the valley,  great service and delicious food. $5 rolls during happy hour.  Hail satan."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this little gem!  I grew up about 2 miles from this sushi joint and lived there my whole young adult life. I had never even thought of trying it until my friend recommended it!   It's not that I'm a sushi snob or anything.. I guess you could just say that I judge a book by it's cover.   Knowing that area, it's not the best neighborhood and I didn't think that place could be any good. I know I know, totally misjudged! That's why you don't judge a book by it's cover.. Lesson learned!  Anyways! Best sushi in town. And I've been to many! I always get their crazy boy roll- DELICIOUS! And vegetable tempura. To die for!   Super friendly workers as well. So what are ya waiting for? Don't be so judge mental like me and try it for yourself! Oh and killer happy hour as well"}
{"text":"Really slow! Over forty minutes for the first roll to come out. Are they fishing and flying in the catch to make the roll. Service is ok if you can get there attention. Normal price for sushi compared to other in the area. Sushi is ok. So I won't be back but if you like long waits for everything due stop by."}
{"text":"At went to this place because of the rating it received! I ordered  under the Fresh Rolls: Firecracker & Rock N' Roll, they were good but nothing spectacular.. I then ordered an entree terriyaki Salmon (this was with the sushi rolls we ordered) and let's just say for abt 20 mins that entree plate never came out and in that same time frame the waitress never even bothered checking on us. Not satisfied at all with the service.  If you're looking for a place with really good sushis, great food selection, and happy hour all day (sushis) check out OH YAH SUSHI (49th ave/Tbird). Highly recommend the Hawaiian sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a lady we spoke with in the lobster roll line when we attended Food Truck Friday. It was a good suggestion and so worth it. So good! Made up for last week's mediocre sushi. Plus you know a sushi place will be great when you see Japanese sushi chefs. Another visit is in order during their happy hour times."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great!  We came in on a Sunday. Have been to a few sushi places  and this place had way superior flavor.  Inside is super cute and the staff is nice. We had Amy as our server.  Will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Called and tried to make a reservation for a party of 7 but they wouldn't take one and said it would be fine. so I drove 45 min there and they couldn't make space for us. This place has a bad policy about reservations. Bad business have bad policies"}
{"text":"The happy hour sushi is very good value.  We ordered the calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll, and udon noodle soup.  Not authentic Japanese, but decent sushi.  Average, maybe slightly below average miso soup.  Left feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great. We had a variety of the fried veggies and a bunch of fried sushi rolls like the spicy tuna as well as the caterpillar roll(not fried). Additionally we enjoyed a cold Kirin ichiban. Service, quality, and atmosphere were top notch. We would recommend and return. Thanks"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Phoenix my wife and I were in dire need of a sushi fix.  Luckily we decided to try this location.  We were promptly seated and given menus.  I went ahead and tried a large selection of fish; mackerel, albacore, salmon, tuna, and yellow tail.  After a short wait our food arrived.  Everything was presented well, and I was more than happy with the portion size.  The albacore, salmon, tuna and yellow tail were very good, tasted fresh, and had small variations of additional ingredients. The mackerel was light in flavor, and the extras added in(ponzu possibly) just muddled the taste.  I did enjoy the fish, but for the price I was not entirely impressed.  The rolls we ordered as well were what you would except out of a sushi orientated restaurant.  I was extremely happy with the Heart Attack, as it really surprised me with it's texture.  Still, the price was a tad high for what we were given.     All in all, the meal was good, but it was not great.  It satisfied my sushi fix, but it could not sell me into becoming a regular.  If you're in North Phoenix and are craving sushi, maybe try this spot.  Although there are quite a few other locations around with far better pricing."}
{"text":"We normally come here during their happy hour time which starts early at 8pm, which I love. They also recently expanded their restaurant.  From the happy hour menu we normally order the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna. It's like a grownup of version of a rice crispy treat, but for people who like sushi. It's basically fried sticky rice topped with spicy tuna. I'm salivating as I write this. We also like ordering the Calamari Tempura roll and Shrimp Tempera roll, both are quite big and tasty! On the regular menu, I would recommend trying the Rock & Roll. It's a mixture of salmon ,tuna, avocado, and krab rolled up in cucumber. The taste is great and very appetizing. I've also tried their Curry Noodle soup, it was just ok. But if you're looking for sushi in North Phoenix this is a good option."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in AZ at this point.  I went to lunch with 5 of my friends and we managed to cover about 75% of the menu with our orders.   I got the chicken bento box which came with the spicy tuna roll, which, not to cheat on my sushi place back home, was probably one of my favorites.  The chicken itself was not the kind I would expect in a bento box as it kinda tasted like it had a Southwest grill rub on it.  Yummy, but not what I expected.   The miso was good, better than any I've head in the area.  I didn't like the 'dressing' that came on the salad, and I'm not sure why. My friends allowed me to try their rolls, but now that I'm writing it, I couldn't tell you exactly what they were except to say I enjoyed them.  A few people got the sashimi which I didn't try so I can't comment on the quality of that. To finish off our lunch, we got the green tea fried ice cream, which was HUGE.  Three of us working together didn't really put a dent into this thing. Bottom line: I think I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I just arrived to Phoenix and wanted to find a sushi place.  We were shocked that we were able to find something on a Sunday afternoon at 1:00pm.  We did a Yelp search and found Yen Sushi & Sake Bar.    We walked in, we were nicely greeted and got seated right away:  We got the following: Shrimp Tempura - We actually got two orders, because it was so good.  The breading was thin and the shrimp was pretty big.  Spicy Tuna over Crispy Rice - So good!!  That's all I can say.  Spicy Tataki Roll - I love the marinated onion on the roll.   They don't skimp on the fish.  Yellowtail Sushi - My husband was definitely a fan.  Tuna Sushi - Loved it.  Spicy scallop hand roll - The best!  911 roll -  It was good, I probably could have done without it.  It was kind of plain so I the soy sauce and wasabi made up for it.  When I'm in Phoenix next time, I will definitely go here."}
{"text":"Sushi here is amazing. I have been to \"upscale\" sushi restaurants that cost a fortune and yet I still  find myself always looking forward to Yen. I could honestly go on and on about how delicious it is but really that's all there is to say. It's that good. Happy hour is awesome too. $5 rolls and sake bombs. Always super busy during happy hour of course. I love how they extended the restaurant so there's really not a wait if you get there when happy hour first starts. Crazy boy is my favorite! I always order it when I go. You are missing out if you haven't tried Yen! Do yourself a favor and go! You're welcome."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Yen Sushi and I was impressed. They brought us complimentary Miso soup with our meal and because we made it in during Happy Hour (3 PM - 5 PM) we paid only $5 for each sushi roll. We had the Philadelphia roll, the calamari roll, the spicy tuna tempura roll, the salmon tempura roll and the tempura green tea ice cream also $5.   I was stuffed by the 3rd roll, but very carefully made it through the delicious ice cream! Definitely a treat in 112 degree weather.   The bill came to $27.08. Very reasonable for all that we ate and the excellent quality and care that was put into our dishes.  I'm going to head back around 8 PM so I can grab a $5 watermelon martini at their 8 PM - close Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Overall, quality of fish is pretty fresh! Customer service is great as well! I ordered a beer but then changed my mind and they were more than happy to take it back even though they already opened it. That was very nice! Price is a bit high for Phoenix, but overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"Yen is our go to place for sushi, even though we have a dozen sushi places closer to our house. The people are always so friendly and the have an amazing reverse happy hour from 8-close. We used to have to wait for a table, but they just expanded to accommodate more people. Sushi is amazing!"}
{"text":"Review 1: Shrimp soy paper, yellow tail, crunch roll. Nice decor, good service, local sometimes colorful customers. Good prices. Ok service.  Review 2: still good food. Prices up. Too up. At least 2 servers standing against a wall at all times. Even when there's service needed. The use the team strategy but there's no overlap in service. You're gonna wait or wave to get somebody's attention. Everybody's pleasant though. Deep fried shrimp shumai is a tasty appetizer."}
{"text":"WOW! Even though it is more $$$$ than our normal Tokyo Lobby, it was nice, food was tasty and will return."}
{"text":"I was in a trip to Phoenix. I had a dinner with my friends at Yen. All my buddies are very sensitive to Japanese foods. Yen is amazing.   We really enjoyed fresh and yummy sushi, salmon, tempura. It had a great variety of quality sakes (Kubota). Also to be honest, I don't like rolls, its rolls are the best, I highly recommended. No MSG. Tempura, Chicken, BBQ Ribs, we ordered many dishes more than we needed. All are very perfect. The next day, we went back to this restaurant for lunch and ordered bentos. As we expected, bentos are awesome. Don't miss this restaurant!~~"}
{"text":"Came to try this place bc of the reviews. Lived up to its ratings and more!  Unique rolls. Fresh & excellent flavors. You've gotta try the grilled yellowtail collar-perfectly done. Attentive, friendly, and prompt service. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D  There is only one thing I don't like. Sometimes it get's to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away."}
{"text":"Ugh ..I wanted to like Yen. But I am thinking it was never meant to be. My husband warned me that I wouldn't like it. And that it was pricey. But I was  determined to prove him wrong and took  my girls.  As we entered I immediately had a great vibe, rich dark wood , cozy ,  but tasteful and clean. No overbearing screaming TV, no tacky decor. I knew I was going to love this place. Then to find out they had a Happy Hour Sushi Menu , I was quite pleased. But that is where it began to fall apart. As  soon as she brought me my Diet Coke in a can I was frightened.Nothing good comes of coke in a can with a meal unless you are serving pizza or brats off a cart. After discussing with the waitress that the 10 year old wanted sashimi with nothing on it  ,hers arrived with chives , white radishes  and and oniony soyish sauce... Her two plates of sashimi were quickly pronounced \"gross\".  Even I didn't like one of them.( they did comp that item ) My Happy Hour sushi was blah, no pizzazz  except  the cream cheese chunk in the Phil. roll.   Teenager Daughter acted like she liked her Teriayki  but when pressed for a review gave it only 3 out 6 stars aaaahhhh.   The edadame was fresh and tasty   but I am thinking that's not enough to get my girls back.  I on the other hand really want to like it so if you are willing to buy me dinner and a diet coke I'll try it again."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic sushi places in Arizona! I am a self proclaimed sushi snob and when I head out to Japanese restaurants I usually order rolls to prevent sadness resulting in terrible sushi. Yen Sushi is exactly the opposite for me, while their rolls are delicious, if you are looking for some good nigiri sushi or the freshest sashimi in town this is your place. Yen Sushi also makes the very hard to find cured mackerel and it is divine!! My husband an I happily take the 30 minute drive out to Yen Sushi for a good meal, it's really worth it!"}
{"text":"This sushi place has a warm feel with lots of wood and Asian Fonts. The tables are spread out oddly with small tables in the hallway between the two rooms and large family tables in the corners. The menu here offers lots of variety of traditional and untraditional sushi.  My favorite plate we shared was the Yellowtail Collar Appetizer. This was mouth watering delicious. The fish was enhanced with the perfect seasonings that didn't over power the melt in your mouth delicious fish. The sauce and pickled vegetable sides also were complimented it well. It was only a few bites but very succulent and delicious.  We shared some basic salmon and yellowtail sushi to try. They were seasoned under the fish as they should be. Both fish were Ok but the rice was too loose.  A sort of test for me is trying the tuna at a new sushi place because I can only tolerate pristine fresh tuna. We shared a roll made with spicy tuna and seared tuna that had pickled onions on it. The fish wasn't sweet enough for me to be a fan and the rice was too loose.  Maybe I didn't order the sushi this place does best or the sushi that would have suited me best?  Service was friendly and efficient.  Worth a try when your in the area. 3 Stars is A-OK"}
{"text":"How this place has 4 stars just baffles me. The food was nothing more than OK and the service wasnt great."}
{"text":"Great menu....great food....great prices...great SUSHI! I went for happy hour after 8 pm i was expecting more choices from the happy hour menu but it's all good the rolls were amazing...I'm glad I finally found a great place for sushi thats cheap and close to my house! woo hoo! The inside of the restaurant is very clean with tasteful decor... great place for a date or as a group"}
{"text":"I just want to commend this restaurant!!!!! They overcharged me last night on my bill ... I did not notice til I looked at my credit card balance this morning. I called them today and explained their little snaffoo. The manager Liz asked me to bring in my receipt and card when I could so she can look at this further. I arrived at the restaurant a little bit ago and she made it right gave me back the difference and KEPT APOLOGIZING!!!! I've been going to this place since they opened and I just love them. They definitely deserve the 5 stars??"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. Good specials and the food was good. The decor and decoration was very nice as well. I will go back there to try dinner."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi bar. They just added on some room to the restaurant which is really cool. Edamame is always good. The service is good. The sushi is amazing. I've had so many from there. I was just there yesterday for my birthday and had the heart attack and it's just so yummy. It's not too fishy. So it's perfect if you don't want too much fish. I love fish but I thought that it would be a good mix. It's a mix of stuff in a jalapeño and rice. So only get it if you like spicy. The motchi (not sure how to spell it) is a desert they have that is just amazing. They have three flavors. Mango, strawberry and green tea. It's that flavor of ice cream in this almost gummy fuzzy thing. It sounds gross but I promise it's so so good."}
{"text":"I was having a crazy sushi craving and unfortunately I no longer live in Scottsdale and going to Sushi Roku was out of the question. I pulled up sushi restaurants on Yelp and it was a showdown between Yen and Tokyo Lobby. Tokyo Lobby has weird hours so I just went to Yen.  I was blown away by the variety of rolls they have on the menu I wanted to order them all but I settled on a Philly roll and the heart attack. I was caught off guard when I saw that the salmon was placed on top of the sushi and not in the roll. I usually don't like my sushi that way but I ate it all it was delicious. The heart attack was really was like an Asian jalapeno popper I've never seen anything like this at any other sushi restaurants it was amazing. My sisters ordered bento boxes and they were very pleased with their meals before we were done eating we were already making plans to come back!   I feel so lucky I have found a great sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been all around the valley looking for a decent Sushi location.  I finally found my spot at the Yen Sushi & Sake Bar.  This place is great and when it comes to Sushi I don't care how much I spend. strongly recommend, will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years now and ever since their expansion, the quality has taken a nosedive.  I was there last week and ordered a few of my favorites (the 911 roll, the heart attack, sea urchin, yellowtail and albacore sushi).  You really can't mess up fried stuff, but the yellowtail and albacore were awful.  It's a downward trend that's been happening for a while.  The servers are amazing but I'm sad about my once favorite sushi place in the valley (Yen Sushi).  Shame.  I'll not return."}
{"text":"Had great sushi but the chicken yaki soba was faaaaaaantastic. Cool, relaxed vibe. Solid service. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Over the past year Yen has gone down hill with their servers and food. The happy hour is decently priced but the actual fish slices on the rolls are basically transparent. Servers have been rude and brief on multiple occasions. Used to dine here almost weekly and after the last meal I am doubtful I will return. This is a shame after dining at yen for years prior."}
{"text":"I have been eying this place for awhile now and finally had the pleasure of eating here this Saturday. They just started a Happy Hour last month yay perfect timing got there at exactly 3 pm it goes on till 6. It was my sis in law's b-day and the staff was cheerful as we took up the whole sushi bar with the 6 of us. They must have just opened their door's as no one else was there yet. Talking to the su chef's we learned Yen Sushi comes from LA, they have 4 location's out there they look even better than this place very very nice you'd think you were in Scottsdale based on the decor. What this place is doing on the same corner as a Subway!?! I have no idea!   Beautiful presentation and the sushi satisfied everyone's craving's! We had sushi mainly see crappy phone pics sorry I had to borrow my brothers crappy phone. I didn't care for the veggie sampler too much I was disappointed it didnt look like the picture and wasnt too appetizing the flavors just did not work for me, but other than that everything was grrrreat! They even brought the bday girl a huge green tea sundae, she absolutely loved it and it was way better than most places that give you cut up oranges. They said this place is hopping at night and we picked a good time to come before the dinner rush. People started to trickle in just before we left. I cant wait to go back soon and try some more yummy goodness I am very happy with my find!"}
{"text":"This is my spot for a business meeting in North Phoenix! I have also taken my family here a few times for our normal Sunday lunch.  The place is really decorated nicely... not \"over the top\" cheap Japanese stuff, conservative and very nicely done. Casual and comfortable.   The service and staff are awesome. The variety of the rolls are awesome. Want something you don't see? The chef's will make it for you. They know almost all the various names and ingredients of most rolls.  Prices are really good. One catch - they serve canned soda (as of 7.4.2012)... so refills are not free. No biggie for me, but someone reading this may care.  NOTE: I use this place all the time for business meetings. Since I am normally there for 2+ hours, I make it worth the wait staffs time and tip appropriately. While we have never spoken about it, they know that I will cut the meeting short, pack up and leave if I see the place filling up (have done it a few times). I think this is common courtesy and wish more \"mobile-office\" people would do the same."}
{"text":"Went there for reverse happy hour last night with my sweetie and another couple.  Place was really good and the prices were great!  911 roll was very tasty but not spicy at all.  Also had the Philly roll, spicy tuna, salmon tempura roll(very good), dragon roll and seaweed salad and really enjoyed ourselves!  Not too far from home, and definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I have passed by Yen Sushi & Sake Bar several times over the past couple of years always promising myself that I would venture inside and try the place out. However, I never made the leap - until last weekend. My daughter and her fiance raved about Paul, the sushi chef/owner of Yen and told me if I didn't go check it out I would be doing myself a severe disservice.   Since my very dear friend SLR and I had not seen in each other for some time and were ardent sushi fans, I suggested she schlep up to my part of town and meet me at Yen for dinner. Besides....I was paying. When I arrived at the restaurant after an aerobic shopping session, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Paul, the owner, was no other than the Paul I knew from the sushi bar at Takamatsu (a Korean restaurant at 43rd Ave. & Olive).  Paul remembered me and asked about my kids. I told him that my older daughter advised me to come in and now I was especially looking forward to a culinary work-out because Paul is nothing short of amazing. SLR and I arrived at the restaurant at 5pm and didn't leave until 8pm. We enjoyed the dinner, drinks, and company. We never felt rushed or made to feel that we were \"holding up the wheels of progress\" by hanging out for so long.  Not only do I enjoy trying out the standard sushi fare at every restaurant (I'm a dyed-in-the-wool spicy scallop nigiri fan) but also adventurous enough to sample specialties of the house. We ordered the Rainbow Roll, a Caterpillar Roll, some nigiri sushi, and the piece de resistance:  the Palm Springs Roll which is a crab roll covered in a not-too-rich but just-right creamy sauce and small, delicately cut pieces of TOMATOES! I have never seen this particular dish offered at any other sushi venue so I have nothing against which to compare it. I will say, however, that it was FANTASTIC.  The prices at Yen Sushi and Sake Bar are below average but the food is so far above average that I don't have room enough in this review to expound on the details. Trust me and go to Yen!"}
{"text":"I'm striking out lately loving restaurants as much as I hear others do, but I do like Yen!  The likes: happy hour prices and times, location, atmosphere, friendly service, tasty & fresh sushi! Why it's not a love affair: happy hr roll choices are mostly deep fried, and I have yet to get a table, only been squished at the sushi bar. At 9pm nonetheless.  All in all, I'm glad to have Yen in my sushi rotation, but I won't be crowding the sushi bar regularly."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Not the best I have experienced, but some of the better sushi for Arizona. They also offer a variety of Japanese soups and entrees. Very Asian decor. The place is located in a strip mall. Nice variety of selections on the menu. Long wait list to be seated on weekend nights. And when the place is busy, also expect a short wait to use the restrooms, which are located in a confined area."}
{"text":"My bff's and I used to be regulars here, but we always get such terrible service every time we have been coming that after this last time, I don't think we will be returning. Reverse happy hour is a good deal, the sushi and other foods here are good, but when you are getting bad service, makes all of that not worth it. If you do end up coming, 8pm is reverse happy hour, they have hot sake, wines, and a handful of decent rolls on the HH menu. Don't expect good service."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their happy hours are great. They have one in the early afternoon, and one that starts at 8pm.   Many of their happy hour rolls are tempura based, but are quite delicious if you don't mind the fried part. I think the rolls were about $5 each. They have a few drinks on the happy hour menu too. A cosmo was $5 off the happy hour menu.   I've been here a few times and the service seems friendly. I haven't had any bad experiences."}
{"text":"We love that place and have been eating there for the best part of 2 years now! Very good sushi at all times!  And it's hand down one of the best places for sushi lunch deals! Eating there outside the happy hour or the lunch hour is however a lot more expensive, so we generally stick to lunch!"}
{"text":"If you want Scottsdale ambiance and a place to been seen, go to Ra, Stingray, Blue Wasabi or Pure.  If you want excellent sushi at reasonable prices, go to Yen.  The sushi is amazing and you and a date can escape for under $50.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in the valley.  Usually start with yellow tail sashimi, then move onto one of their happy hour rolls, with a couple of sake bombers to wash it all down.  I have tried their expensive Forever Young roll ($18) and it was really tasty.  Probably will not be ordering that particular roll very much but I am glad I tried it.  Great place with great Happy Hour menu."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Yen Sushi about a 1 1/2 years ago and it's one of my favorite places. The first time I went I wanted to just get takeout and I did over order but it was AMAZING! The second time I actually ate at the sushi bar and Paul is awesome! Service is top notch and so is the sushi. This places is great for lunch, dinner or even takeout. I would go there several times a week but now I'm down to at least once to get my sushi fix.   You won't go wrong with ANY dish you have at Yen Sushi.   AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too excited about this place but I really liked the \"Don't Cry Roll\" it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this little secret place. The staff all greet you when you walk in and the environment is comfortable, low lighting and quiet. Its a great place to relax and have good conversation.  Happy hour is great, if you can sneak out of work early or wait to eat until 8pm. I love the clam or baby lobster miso soup. Perfect for sharing.... Thanks for a great little local place."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews, I wanted to try this place out.  Food was pretty good...one dish, the Heart Attack (crazy yummy jalepeno and tuna, crab and cream cheese number) was OUTSTANDING.  The rest of the food we ordered was pretty good.  But the service was lame, lame lame.  Ugh.  I had to flag someone down for a 2nd glass of wine and it wasn't easy to find someone.  Then I had to flag someone else down for a refill on water.  I told the waitress it seemed like they were ignoring us.  She was so nice...but dang, the service was weak.  Food came up quickly though.  Almost too quick.  The table was covered in plates we ordered...nothing was staggered.  A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we only ordered from the Happy Hour menu, but all of the sushi rolls had some tempura (read, FRIED) component to them, and the salmon and shrimp crunch rolls had some white, weird, sperm looking sauce all over them.  Also, I've eaten A LOT of tempura...I mean A LOT; I have never had a tempura carrot, and if they are going to fry a carrot could they cut it down to be less than 3 inches thick? It was inedible.  The service was ok, but honestly I don't understand all of the high reviews for this place.  It was overpriced and just not very good.  The reason I'm giving them two stars instead of 1 is the happy hour menu had pretty good beer prices."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall, SIGN ME UP!!!  We ate at Yen with my dad and sister and the food was great. The boys has Udon noodles, and the rest of us had sushi.  My favorite was the Philly roll with asparagus.  My favorite roll ever has asparagus, so this was a huge suprise and a total treat!   Yen is completely unassuming from the outside, and you would easily drive past it.  It is totally worth stopping into say hi and have some excellent food, both sushi and Japanese."}
{"text":"This is the best local sushi spot I've ever been to... and I have been to ALL of them. There is nothing like this place... such a fresh, authentic, flavorful taste to every roll and all of my girlfriends agree. It's such a hidden gem, surprisingly. When we found this place, we didn't know what to expect. After one happy hour session and tons of rolls later, we were ECSTATIC. It's so close to home, too. I love love LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I'm so mad at myself for being so close to this place, but never had the opportunity to check it out until just recently. I absolutely LOVE coming here for their lunch specials. $8.99 for miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll? Heck yes! It's such a great alternative to eating fast food for lunch when you are essentially paying the same price. I've already been here 3 times within a couple weeks of my first visit!"}
{"text":"I'd like to think I'm an avid Sushi eater, Yen is the go to spot for my friends and I. I have gone to other Sushi restaurants that make you spend a certain amount in order to get Happy Hour prices but not a Yen. Their Happy Hour is  very good and the staff is always very timely and polite. I'd say I come here at least once a week. Great place!"}
{"text":"Come here a least once every couple weeks. My boyfriend go for happy hour on Friday nights. We drink sake bombs, eat off the happy hour sushi menu. The crazy boy roll is AMAZING. I'm not partial to California rolls, but this is tempura style and they put the eel sauce on top. SOOO GOOD. We eat and drink and come out of there paying $30 max. If you come RIGHT at happy hour, there will be a crazy wait. We come an hour or 2 hours before close and get right in."}
{"text":"Once again, thank you Yelp.  My husband and I were looking for a sushi place closer to home and I found Yen on yelp.  We went there last night and were greeted by a sweetheart at the front door and ushered to a table for the bar.  The place was very clean, well staffed and had our kind of people in it.  There was a mix of older couples, bikers, teenagers and dates.  Perfect! We ordered 5 of their specialty rolls, sake bombers because it was happy hour and a raspberry sake the waitress recommended.  First off- the baked lobster roll is to die for.  It is a little pricey but has a generous portion of FRESH lobster. I have never enjoyed sake bombers before but for $5 during happy hour...why not?  The waitress recommended a certain Japanese beer to pair with the sake and it hit the mark.  I did try one of their martini happy hour drinks.  Do steer clear of these.  Not much alcohol and tasted like Kool-Aid.  After our dinner we wanted one of their higher end sake's and were encouraged to try the raspberry.  It was super delicious.  My husband does not like sweet girly drinks and he wants us to find the bottle to keep in our house. All in all Great service + great rolls + romantic ambiance + fantastic drink specials + wonderful cocktails = 5 stars.  We will be regulars here now."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. They have really good  specials and the fish is always fresh."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.   Eh ..wasnt the greatest sushi spot.  Based on the rating i thought it wouldve been a good hole in the wall sushi restaurant, but it was ok, nothing spectacular.  Hawaiian roll, shrimp tempura, were decent. The spicy tuna on crispy rice tasted like pop rocks."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Yen Sushi and Sake bar. We have eaten there several times the restaurant is lovely. The food is always good the only thing we don't like is the canned soda :( The Las Vegas roll is our favorite but you can't go wrong, everything is good. Prices are a little high try going during lunch before 3pm. or happy hour is 3pm-5pm where they offer several items for $5."}
{"text":"I'm glad we found this place after having such a bad experience at another place prior to this. We were seated promptly and they were quick at taking our orders. I had the Nabeyaki Udon, it was the best udon ever. It even came with a perfectly made egg yolk, just exactly how I eat my noodles. We also ordered two other sushi rolls and both were delicious.   The place is nice, clean and the atmosphere was comfortable. We had a good vibe right when we walked in. The walls were super unique with prints of Japanese writings and abstract art. The service was good too.   They also had a great selection from their happy hour menu. Overall, this place made me happy and I was very pleased with the service they gave us. We'll be coming back here often!!!"}
{"text":"It's just another Sushi place.  Clean, descent food.  I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't notice any specialty item that is a must have to come back anytime soon.  The prices are very reasonable and probably the best place for that area of town."}
{"text":"Yen Sushi is a cute little mom and pop sushi joint.  I came with my family for a quick bite of lunch.  Overall, decors were modern Japanese with some nice artwork hanging from the walls.  The place was pretty dark, but I gather they were shooting for cool modern sushi bar look.  My cousin ordered their shrimp udon noodles and my brother-in-law and I shot for their Bento box; he got the short ribs and me I got the spicy pork.  Along with the Bento came miso soup, steamed rice, tempura vegetables, Japanese salad, and some spicy tuna roll.  Everything was pretty much basic as for the spicy pork; definitely could have used a little more kick to it.  My brother-in-law's short rib was probably a better bet.  We both felt it had more flavors than the pork.  My cousin said her udon noodles were good at best.    In the end, Yen Sushi looks like a little hot spot for patrons close by.  I think overall it's good enough, but Bento box for $9 is not a bad deal at all!  Based on what I've heard the sushi here is great so next we shall come by together and see! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrid. Every time we come, they are slow to get your order and it's at least a 15 min wait before they pick the check up and then another 5 min before you get your card back."}
{"text":"We have lived 2 blocks from this place for years but never gone in and now I deeply regret it! The sushi is amazing but if you never try the rest of the food you are missing out. We had the Spicy pork and the Teriyaki chicken and they were both great. We had 3 rolls of sushi the entrees, and the chocolate pyramid and our bill was under $40. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Awesome sushi, great value and very good service... A hidden gem. We eat here when in Phoenix and have a free night.  Don't miss it if you're looking for a casual, laid back evening of sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour and lunch menu! Good for date nights, groups, or families. Sushi is always fresh and tastes great! Drink deals are a plus with delicious green tea ice cream to end the visit. I highly recommend Yen Sushi!"}
{"text":"I've been faithfully going to this restaurant since they first opened a couple years ago - when it was primarily a Korean restaurant... Since then, they've remodeled into a sushi restaurant... and while i definitely miss the korean food (which was AMAAAAAZING), the sushi is quite easily THE BEST in the valley, hands down. seriously. if the restaurant looks a little empty to you, i honestly think it's bc the location sucks. bc the food most certainly doesn't. i guess all the better for me - more sushi for me!!!! i must say, it's nice to be able to just go to dinner on a friday night without having to wait for a seat to open up.  it may seem pricey, but for the quality (and quantity), yen is actually a great deal. service is always fantastic, and the sushi! i'm even tempted to say it's the best i've ever had - and i've had quite a bit of sushi in my day. oh well - that's what keeps my gym in business!  at any rate. if you like sushi, you NEED to come here. i recommend pretty much anything on their menu - the sashimi platters, the fried scallop roll, the calamari roll, the salmon and spicy scallop roll, the i forgot their names rolls. my only sliiiightly negative experience - the crazy boy roll, so named because you gotta be crazy, boy, to eat that. haha, jk. ok, so it didn't suck that much, it just wasn't up to par with the other rolls.   cool thing to note: if you order a sashimi plate, and let's say you don't have a yen (get it? get it? nm.) for let's say, octopus, you can ask if you can substitute - ie, instead of 3 each of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and octopus, we got 4 each of salmon, yt, and tuna. sweet love and no extra charge. awesome.  definitely recommend sticking with the sushi over the noodle and rice dishes. i'm looking forward to coming here for happy hour deals! the only thing that could make this place better? if they started serving korean food again. hint, hint...."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Everything is fresh and they have a creative approach to all of the rolls I've tried. Best albacore nigiri of all time! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this cozy and humble little joint gives the sushi restaurants in the valley some serious competition. The atmosphere is friendly, the prices are very reasonable and the fish is as fresh as it gets.  The head chef and owner Paul, turns over so many tables each week, there's no time for frozen stuff stacked in the back of this gem.  The food speaks volume all in itself.   Sitting at the bar, you'd get to witness some serious knife skills, and you'd see fish so fresh it holds its shape when the knife is run through it.  I've always been partial to Sashimi and rolls that only had raw fish in it, until I was told to order a baked roll from the menu.  The baked scallop roll and baked salmon roll are simply outstanding, if you want something different from a Sushi restaurant, trust me, those are it.   The Sashimi plates are way generous in portion and the variety is well balanced with lean tuna, a to die for seared tuna, and the fattier large cuts of salmon and yellow fin. The Sashimi plare also has slices of cooked octopus, it's no baby octopus either...  If you ask for fresh wasabi, not the paste, you'll experience another side of \"Sushi\" you never had before.   Overall this is a great family owned restaurant, the food is simply tasty and doesn't have that \"fishy taste\" everyone worries about when sushi is mentioned.  If you get to chat with the chef, he's informative and entertaining, all the while cranking out his creations before your eyes. Don't miss the Tuna Tataki Sashimi, the ridiculously fresh tasting Uni (sea urchin) and those mouth watering baked rolls.  Happy hour is definatly worth the trip.  Good job Yen, I was getting tired of signing high bills while on a half empty stomach from most sushi places... you restored the peace.  They also have chopstick helpers for young ones and those of us who may be chopstick challenged."}
{"text":"Good sushi but they serve soda by the can... A fountain drink system is cheaper and people usually drink more than one coke with their meal.."}
{"text":"Went with high hopes, left with low results.  Let's start with the positive. The decor is nice enough to bring a date to, the music is subtle and permits conversation. Then things started going wrong. We were seated and had paper napkins. For the price you pay here, and with the decor, cloth is a no-brainer. The waitress had no idea of what some menu items were. We ordered the scallop volcano roll, tasty, but the rolls were buried under a heap of other food, poor presentation. The sushi fish, was acceptable, but the same quality you'd get from a less expensive restaurant. One ordered food item didn't show up. For desert, we had the chocolate caramel pyramid. That was the best part of the meal, although decidedly not Japanese. Ask for a knife, the shell is hard. At $65 for a couple, without alcohol, you could do much better for yourself elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here like 4 times, it's always amazing sushi. Always fresh and delicious. Highly recommend coming here at least once. Happy hour is great too."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant by far. My girlfriend and I have been visiting this place for just over a year now.  They recognize us as regulars and know what we want to order every time.  The caterpillar roll is fantastic. Our other favorite is the sunset roll."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fantastic sushi, artfully prepared. Happy hour is great for cheap-yet-yummy sushi and killer sake/bombers, and all of the regular priced rolls are amazing. They recently expanded the dining room which helped with 1) the sound (it used to be crazy loud in there, but I still went because the food is so good) and 2) the crowd. It's popular, and honestly, if they hadn't expanded the dining room, I wouldn't give this place a great review because I wouldn't want to add to the competition for a table ;) but all that's solved now so there's no reason not to eat here. LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"My parents owned a sushi restaurant in Colorado for over fifteen years, and they now own a restaurant here in the valley. This is the first time I've \"cheated\" on them by going to another sushi restaurant (aside from when we'd go out as a family to sushi places, and when I lived by myself in California)...and I was not sorry at all!  Not to say that I don't like my parents' sushi--Hell, I grew up eating it and they were very popular in Colorado (surprisingly, you can get very fresh fish in Colorado--it gets flown in daily!), and all of my family from Japan are always impressed with my dad's food.  Nonetheless, the sushi at Yen was excellent. I love the decor--once you're inside, you wouldn't guess it to be a strip-mall place at all! The prices were very reasonable--especially during happy hour, when they have the $5 rolls. The only complaints I have are minor--the rice was a little smashed in my rolls (they pressed too hard while making it), and the hamachi was a little stringy that day--it could've just been the way it was sliced, though. Other than that, everything was delicious! My boyfriend, who doesn't \"do\" sushi, had the yaki-soba, which he thoroughly seemed to enjoy.   And since I'm now estranged from my parents for the time being, I plan on continuing my affair with Yen. Oh, darn..."}
{"text":"Great sushi high quality. They use real tuna not frozen saku blocks. The prices do reflect the quality so be prepared to spend about 20% more than your regular sushi restaurant, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, had the Bento box teriyaki chicken with the Spicy Tuna Roll and Miso soup.  The chicken was dry, the Spicy Tuna Roll was too spicy, and the service was subpar.   I would not recommend this place unless you have no options for Sushi or bento boxes.   J out."}
{"text":"WooHoo!!!!!!  This was so much fun.  My wife and I and a friend went here Friday night around 8pm and the place was packed.  We had a seat at the sushi bar in the middle in front of the fish case.  Paul the sushi chef was so much fun to talk too and laugh with.  The food coming across the bar for others in the restaurant looked amazing and every time we ohoooo'ed & Awwwwww'ed as we gazed upon each item.  We ordered several items.  The crazy boy roll, the Philadelphia roll, the shrimp tempura roll, the calamari roll, the rock & roll roll, and some tuna sushi, & smelt row.  We started with creamy shrimp  These amazing little wantons filled with shrimp and cream cheese with a wasabi cocktail sauce.  Oh my these were yummy.    I am hesitant to write this review because there are so many already on Yelp telling how good this place is and I don't want it to be so crowed when I go that I have to wait for ever to get a table or seat at the bar but this place tops and they deserve props for putting out amazing food and having great personalities at the bar and since we are in a recession I don't want to see them struggle.  So save some dough and hit this place up on your next night out or your next date night.  You wont be disappointed.  The outside does not do the inside justice.  The decor is so warm and inviting and makes you feel like your in a little mom and pop restaurant in Japan but then you walk out side and find yourself back in reality and on bell road.  It's a nice escape."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Yen for years and have never had a bad experience. The service is always good and the food is always great! The inside looks amazing since the expansion. The food is even good to-go! My #1 sushi stop!"}
{"text":"Loved it here. Friendly staff. Really good sushi. I loved the sea weed salad. Definitely a place to enjoy some well made sushi. Will be coming back !!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never have I ever went in their once and not been satisfied. Great service. Amazing food. Amazing prices. Especially their happy hour"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night and snuck in before it got busy.  It's a fun environment with a nice bar and TV.  The service was good, but it seemed they were stretched a little thin.  The late happy hour runs from 8pm to close.  There were four of us - we had 6 rolls, 2 appetizers, a round of drinks and the bill came out to $65.  Probably one of the best sushi happy hours I've seen.    The Gyoza was amazing for appetizer  Salmon Tempora roll was very good   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the first place I tried raw fish!!! I've always stuck to the typical shrimp tempura for yearssss and maybe a small variation but their rolls just looked so good I had to give it a go. I can't get enough of this place, luckily I live close and can go often. I love that there's a patio and you can sit outside when it's nice outside or bring your dog to hangout. If you haven't tried this place yet you have to. Service is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place. Their specials are always fantastic creations. I'd be lying if I didn't say part of the attraction is the close proximity to my work."}
{"text":"**Update... she did charge my sisters card, and she charged my card two times... looks like she either bought herself or someone else lunch on my card.   Went here yesterday with my sister and her son for lunch. Smelled horrible when we walked in, food was good, service was horrible. I wasn't finished and I was going to order something else but she never came around to check on us or ask if we wanted anything else. I had to change my sons diaper so I asked my sister to order what I had wanted when she came back, IF she came back. I come out, she had come back and dropped the check off by the time I got back to the table. Also, I wanted to do separate checks since mine was more, but she was no where to be found, again. So we just decided to split it. Not a big deal one would think. But this girl is and idiot. She ran my card twice instead of one on my sisters card. The cards didn't even look a like! They aren't even close to the same color!"}
{"text":"I make every effort to visit Yen Sushi & Sake as much as possible and it's the primary place I select when wanting to introduce to first timers. As a regular, I've yet to have an experience that was less that stellar and my recent dinner date was just that; stellar indeed.  We checked in slightly before the 5pm happy hour which allowed us prompt attention both on our drink and dinner selections. We got started with Sake Bombs ,went lightly on the dramatics that precede your typical bomber activity but a prefect lead in to getting nicely loosened up for the big meal- Cheers~ I had talked up this meal for some time so I was just a tad anxious about every thing going just perfect. We were off to a good start.  It didn't take us long to decide on our selections and since we were both in an adventurous mood, we opted for something raw, something baked, something fried and something grilled. It's a good thing we were hungry too.  Our selections included a small sashimi sampler which we were allowed to sub out one of the preselected items for tuna titaki. We were both glad we did and it was super cool of them to accommodate without any fuss. The platter was insanely plentiful, fresh and we enjoyed every sampling. We decided on the Hamachi Kama for our grilled item. It was also tasty. Our fried item was the Heart Attack, a cream cheese stuffed jalapeño - one of my faves. Our last item was the baked salmon roll, I think. You see my Sake Bomb glass never went empty so that last item was bit of a blur. What wasn't a blur was the overall meal and the great time we had. I'm confident my dinner date would echo this as well.  The only lesson learned for the next visit is to space out the ordering of the items just a bit. We ordered all selections at the same time and with this much food we could have eased into each plate vs. hitting them all at once - My personal preference entirely.   I'm working on plans for a return visit and many more to follow."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. My husband and I found it using Yelp and saw how many reviews it had. It is definitely worth all 5 stars. From the outside it looked a little sketchy, but we felt better when we saw people inside. We got there around 7:30 and there were about 4 other tables, by 9:00 the place was filled! The atmosphere and service is so much fun! And they have great happy hour prices, which start after 8. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was a nice place, great food, and fun times with friends.  I got the teriyaki chicken and gyoza.  The gyoza was very good.  The teriyaki sauce was too sweet for me.  The servers are good but had to wave them down a few times for refills."}
{"text":"I feel like Yen is slippin. We've gone here for years but it's slowly declined in quality. The atmosphere has a weird smell and the waitresses act like you're bothering them. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the best, freshest sushi I have ever tasted. The coworkers work their butts off for their customers and provide excellent customer service. The owner Paul is very passionate about his restaurant and because of that my boyfriend and I continue returning. I wasn't a huge fish fan growing up and I always just ate the rolls but the tataki roll is so fresh and delicious. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I personally do not like sushi; however, this is my friends personal take on her meal.  \"The sake sashimi was nice and fresh at a great price. The hamachi nigiri had a lovely sesame oil black pepper garnish that really brought out the favor of fish.  The spicy tuna roll was okay. I personally enjoy spicy tuna rolls that are chopped not a big smushy mess. However, highlight of my evening was the chef offered to make me a special roll: sake, masago, avocado maki with spicy mayo and topped with thinly sliced pieces of avocado. Quite delicious and clean taste.  Not the best sushi I've ever had but definitely fair with reasonable prices.\"  I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was very good. The chicken was grilled and remained juicy and tender. The vegetables for the stirfry were quite crunchy...but I may just like my veggies cooked more.   The service was very friendly; however, they did forget one of my appetizers. This did not show up on our bill and they were very apologetic. I was very full at the point that I realize they were not coming and did not make a big deal out of this."}
{"text":"Wow... i went to dinner with hubby tonite and it was a great experience. Friday and Saturday nites are busy but it was worth the wait. I had a Large Hot Sake, hubby had a vodka with cramberry.. for dinner we shared the house salad, tempura roll and the california roll and we were in love. the food was fresh and tasty. and only cost $26.78 = tip during happy hour..we are so coming back every week."}
{"text":"The girls who work here Are very unprofessional. We ate here last night and all they did was huddle in there little area and gossip and laugh while starring at us and other customer s we could wait to leave! Never again!"}
{"text":"Always have a fantastic dine in experience. Happy hour sushi here is the best.  Service is pleasant and the sushi comes out neat, packed closely. We venture here about once a month.  I just had a bad experience with a take out recently. We were shorted a few orders. No side rice and edamame sucks."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprised. The outside looks like a totally different restaurant. The inside is so nice, clean and decorated great. We went for Father's Day so we were a party of 6. We started with vegetable tempura. It was really good. Wish it came with more :) I have the Bento Box with teriyaki chicken. It came with miso soup, salad, rice, 4 pieces of sushi, and two more pieces of tempura. It was all very tasty. Chicken was great! Rice was cooked perfect. Sushi was good. Loved the dressing on the salad. And of course the tempura was my favorite. There were a few other people that got the Bento Box. One got yaki udon. She liked that. And two rice bowls. Service was excellent!! They were so nice and we never ran out of drinks. Everything was great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I go here often to meet up with some friends and just hang out. The last time we went, we brought a friend ((and our new roommate)) here for the first time. Between the 5 of us, needless to say we ordered a lot of sushi. We all got our sushi in a good amount of time, except for my roommate who got his roughly 15 - 20 minutes after everyone else's. I understand they were busy but come on, that was ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, the sushi is good, just the service isn't up to what it used to be when we first started going there."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Sushi, they have recently expanded - so they have a bit more room. Paul has done a great job on the expansion but the sushi is wonderful and fresh. They have some early bird specials, just a class place with a class owner and staff. Food is fantastic and always a good deal.  I have probably been here some 50+ times and it has always been great each and every time."}
{"text":"We have tried other sushi places in our area, and nothing even comes close to Yen.  The happy hour is one of the best, but it's only for two hours in the afternoon (3-5pm) so it's hard for us to get to sometimes.  Never fear though, they also have happy hour from 8pm- close.  A large beer and sake is $5 and they have about 5 $5 rolls.  Most of the cheap rolls are fried, but if that's what you like, you are in luck.    We always order the heart attack roll, which is a California roll topped with jalapeños, tomato, avocado, and big chunks of succulent tuna.  It's also covered in masago and a spicy sauce that brings everything together.  We can't get enough of this roll.  We also order the Sunset roll a lot, which is topped with salmon and lemon, which makes the roll very refreshing and tangy.  The service is always good, and the tiny place is usually packed, so put on your patient hat and wait for a table!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for a good sushi place near the Peoria/Surprise area and this is the place we will be going from now on. The price point is stellar. The food is SPECTACULAR. And the wait staff is incredibly hospitable. Will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Yen has by far one of the best happy hour menus you will find for sushi! Their amazing happy hour menu features $6 rolls and appetizers. They also have a great happy hour drink menu. If you can hit up happy hour from 3-5pm or wait until 8pm-close you can have fancy sushi on a budget! It's nothing fancy on the inside but the sushi won't disappoint. It's the perfect little spot for a girls night or a date night out!"}
{"text":"Basically the only spot in az I go for sushi. Top notch quality at a reasonable price. I come here for my birthday every year"}
{"text":"Excellent rolls and chicken teriyaki was the best we have had anywhere...even New York. We were in town for 4 days, went to Yen Sushi and Sake Bar three of them. Even ate in the restaurant for lunch one day (the rest of the times were carry out) and was very happy with the service and the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"The fresh rolls were not bad but way overpriced. Ordered a Ono toro roll, a yellowtail belly nigiri, and a boston roll cost me $38 before tips. I could eat way better in California for that price"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious -- very tasty sashimi platter. Loved the ambiance too -- a nice respite from the very toasty desert outside. :)"}
{"text":"The prices are not competitive at all. The service is great though. Their menu isn't online which actually keeps me from ordering pick up because their rolls are fairly unique so I can never remember what I like. Their fish is very fresh actually, and they give you a fried zucchini and sweet potato that is so delicious it complements the sushi. The food is delicious so I give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I only come here for happy hours because I don't think the food is worth regular price. That being said, it's a lot better than many other sushi restaurants in the area (I've tried plenty). The place is tiny and it's always packed Friday and Saturday night with Midwestern students so if you're going in a big group, expect a long wait. It's usually just my bf and I so we just sit at the bar. One time, we saw a big group of his friends and they've been waiting for a table for 1.5hr+. They left in the end pretty upset because they've been regulars there for 2+ years yet they were completely ignored if the place is crowed.  They've since moved on to another hangout.  The servers are great except for this one older asian lady. She's always very unfriendly to us and act like she couldn't care less. We've been going there for 3 years and it seems like she's a lot ruder to asian customers. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon. It's too bad because we have a pretty good relationship with  the sushi chef."}
{"text":"Decent food. Small sized rolls and definitely $2-3 more than most comparable sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to go to have some great Sake with your food. There is a very good selection of Sake varieties. And the food was good too. Also nicer inside than you mighy expect when looking at the storefront."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in the valley. The fish is always fresh and I've even been there when the chefs were about to filet a big eye tuna. Great stuff!  Located in an ugly strip mall which can be a deterrence from trying. Don't let this stop you. The service is nice and casual and they remember you."}
{"text":"The happy hour special is a great deal (bunch of drinks, appetizers, and rolls for only $5 each). The place was packed on a Thursday night (a good sign, typically) but there was only one waitress (terrible planning) so the service was horribly slow. Las Vegas rolls and Salmon Tempura rolls to die for; but on the other hand, they put asparagus where it doesn't belong (in a Philly roll? Really?) and the Gyoza was an atrocity."}
{"text":"The uni was so fresh, it tasted sweet!   The sushimen here definitely know how to cut. Each slice of sashimi was uniform and cold at the table.   So good! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I recommend going during happy hour!! 8-close. I've been going to this place for several years and it's my absolute favorite sushi place. Always fresh, always delicious. My favorite thing is the bbq beef rib roll (with extra veggies instead of crab). And oh em gee. It is heavenly. Also recommend their chicken yaki soba and spicy tuna crush rice roll!!! Although food is phenomenal, I have had bad luck with service. But the past couple times I have visited, service has been exceptional."}
{"text":"The sushi? Pretty good, not much rice on the rolls, and good amount of filling. Scallop sushi was probably the best here, very fresh! Tataki roll was pretty lit as well. The service was alright, aura outside was casual. Inside seating seemed a little bit fancier, but not too much. Good for large groups or people with children."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this sushi spot.  Another 'west side' gem (and there's not too many, unfortunately).  Sushi is outstanding and the menu offers many options.  I'm a rice snob and the rice is excellent...that's not always the case at other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"So I just moved to Glendale AZ from Los Angeles and was craving sushi. I did what I always do & looked on Yelp for nearby sushi places, because Yelp has always been the best tool for finding anything great. I was so delighted to see Yen Sushi was less than a block from my house and looked like the highest rated place nearby. I decided to check it out by myself for lunch. I am not a big fan of spicy food, so I was hoping there would be some great non-spicy sushi as well (because a lot of people on Yelp only spoke of the spicy rolls.)   The first thing I realized was that there was a lot of choices just for sushi & I liked how they were categorized baked, tempura, fresh, etc. I saw so many rolls that looked yummy, but they were expensive. I didn't like the prices so much, but for good sushi, you can't expect it to be super cheap...I'll have to try out the happy hour next time. I decided on the Hawaiian Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, and their California Roll. My favorite was the Shrimp Tempura Roll..it was HUGE! So yummy & it came with tempura vegetables. The Hawaiian Roll is good; it is garlicky! I got the CA Roll because I figured if that was not good then I was S.O.L.  I now know that 3 rolls are waaaay to much for me. I am used to 6 pieces that are small. These are pretty big with 7 or 8 pieces! It cost me $27.00 for lunch which was more than I would usually pay, but now I know I can get away with 2 rolls to fill me up. I would definetly recommend this place anytime. I am excited to try the happy hour, but I will be bummed about the special rolls not being on sale, because those are my favs."}
{"text":"yes, yes, yes! thank you yelp. this is one place that i will keep coming back to. the caterpillar roll, garlic tuna roll, crunchy scallop roll were beautiful and the presentation was pretty. my dining partner is not so adventurous on the sushi front, as evidenced by our sushi order, but i tried enough to say everything was fresh and tasty. service was friendly, even when i spilled my water all over the table. i was really, really surprised how small this place is. i hope they'll be able to expand someday. if they keep the quality high there will definitely be a need. on the alcohol front, sake bombers ($5) are probably your best bet. the night i visited they had beer, sake and vodka only. i found that a bit strange, but since i'm a vodka kind of girl it didn't bother me a bit."}
{"text":"Absolutely best place to get sushi in the valley.I've been going for 4 years and it just keeps getting better! Their happy hour menu is super affordable and great quality."}
{"text":"I love yen sushi. I have gotten so many people into it and everybody agrees it is one of the best. U recommend get their early if u are trying their happy hour because they get busy. My favorite rolls are the spicy tuna, playboy roll and the shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"Returned to this place and still love it!! I decided I would love it more if they had normal happy hours. The HH begins at 8? Strange. We would go more often if it began at 4 or 5 and lasted until 6 or 7. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Slow service with an impatient waitress, however the food was good.  Why is it that the waitress couldn't just say, \"How are you tonight?\"  It seemed like we were rushed and then ignored tonight.  :(     I like sitting there, and I like the food but DANG, how about some attention and general appreciation for being there?  Not once were we asked if we were OK, if we liked it, or if we wanted another item or cocktail..."}
{"text":"A very clean and friendly sushi bar very close to home. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box and a Phoenix roll. The bento boxes are available until 3pm everyday and include miso soup. Everything was delicious and the staff was so nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and has a cozy, quiet feel. Our servers were pleasant, but not very attentive. When we asked the first server if any of the rolls were gluten-free, she replied, \"Umm... I'd guess this one\" (and she was wrong).  Sorry, but folks with a gluten allergy can't afford to guess. On the plus side, multiple servers asked the chef(s) about it, so we were able to find compatible choices... and they do provide gluten-free soy sauce!  The prices were in line with the two-dollar-sign rating. Most rolls were in the $11-$15 range. That's typical for above-average sushi.   Things were looking positive as we awaited our food. The dishes arrived very quickly... in about 1/2 the time I expected. The presentation was average. Unfortunately, the serving size was TINY!  Check my photos... the nigiri is of typical size, and the $10.50 Philadelphia Roll next to it looks like a preschool toy. It's easily half or less the size of the rolls I've had at *every* other sushi restaurant. The $12.95 Hawaiian Roll on the left side of my other photo is the same miniature size as the Philadelphia. The taste for each of them was slightly below average. Not much in the way of detectable spices, and the fish had virtually no flavor at all. The $10.50 Rock & Roll on the right side of photo #2 was just slightly larger diameter than a normal-sized sushi roll, but there were only five pieces, so it was about the same volume as their other miniature rolls. The cucumber wrap was fresh and tasty.  Unfortunately that was the only detectable taste. The ingredients were completely flavorless.   So, overall I'd say the food would be a good value at about 40% of the asking price. I would have rated this experience with just one star, but the pleasant ambiance was worth a second star.   Unless something drastically changes, like perhaps new management, I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"We've been to a lot of sushi places in Phoenix and this is now the only one we eat at. The atmosphere is lovely, the service is always excellent and the variety and quality of the sushi is as good as anything we've had. My favorite roll is the Palm Springs Roll, which is made awesome by the large chunks of tuna atop the roll. It's a meal in itself. Plus, if you bring a non-sushi eating friend, you can trick them into eating the very delicious Beef Teriyaki Roll, also a meal in itself.  The happy hour menu includes their crispy tuna, which is a lovely little dish."}
{"text":"They are a favorite spot for me and my guy. They have a regular happy hour and a reverse happy hour that starts at 8pm. They also have great lunch specials. When you go I highly recommend the calamari tempura roll it is so good! It is even on their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Yen about 3 years now.  Ive learned to wait til the evening happy hour for better service.     Try not to get the older woman its like she looks down on you even though your tipping her."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of sushi places in Phoenix, but this is my FAVORITE!  The best AND worst part about Yen Sushi: they have great specials every night after 8pm. They place a lot of their quality rolls on \"happy hour\" for only $5! The bad part about that? It's crowded! This is a small sushi bar tucked in a strip mall-type setting, so when they fill up there isn't much room to wait for a table.  It didn't get 5 stars from me because of the service. It's lacking! Even when tables are open, expect to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before you are greeted. When you ARE seated, refills usually come only when you ask for them.  Overall, this place is exceptional. Sure the service may need some improvement but you can't beat the quality of the food, the specials they offer, and the inviting environment. Give it a try, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Yen. When we first started going there it was a much smaller place, they have $5 happy hour from 3-5 then 8 to close. The $5 happy hours rolls have expanded, and so has the restaurant.  They have gotten much busier and its so great to see a small business do well!  The staff is great and when they are packed the weight still isn't too long.  If you go try the hot green tea!!! Its great!"}
{"text":"Sushi is awesome here! I love the rolls they create! The staff is so friendly and I've never had a problem with our order. I've been eating here for sushi for the past 6 or 7 years. It also just expanded which I love! The happy hour is the best too! And the lunch menu deal is awesome too! Try the crazy boy roll!"}
{"text":"Place is the awesome friendly staff and clean facility. I've been here about 5-7 times and each time was just as good as the first time."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. It's the best! The rolls here are very good! Every birthday I come here with all my friends, at least 20! The staff is very accommodating and its just absolutely my favorite place. The happy hour prices are better than anybody else around and they do great birthday parties! I get the Dragon roll and every time it's just prefect! I recommend this place to everyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"Come after 8 and do not expect fast service, but it's very worth it!!! The best Sushi in North Phoenix / Glendale."}
{"text":"Good sushi, tea that tasted like dirt.  I was feeling sushi, so I iPhoned the place that had the best reviews around and found Yen.  It was a small storefront in a strip mall, but had great sushi.  Prices were normal, and they had some good specialty rolls that unique and tasty.  I was feeling a little non-H1N1-cold sick, so instead of some sake and beer, I opted for some hot tea.  It smelled like dirt and tasted exactly the same. Not like it was gross or funny tasting...it tasted like dirt, topsoil, terra firma. I am not a Japanese tea connoisseur  so I didn't send it back, because I thought maybe it was sort of special herbal healing dirt tea, I don't know.  Otherwise good sushi!  If any fellow yelpers has any say on that, dirt teat thing, I'd love to hear it."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the quality and price of their lunches. $9 for bento boxes or sushi combos 7 days of week!  My kids and us love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sushi restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive, the food came out in a reasonable time, and it tasted amazing. The rolls were well made and definitely work of art. Beautifully made! The price was also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love our cozy sushi restaurant. Food is always fresh and delicious. Love their hot tea."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. Their sushi is delicious and I have yet to have a bad experience here! Very yummy id recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This review unlike (some of) my other ones will be short and simple. Comes down to the question - Do you want some super yummy sushi? Then - YES - do come to Yen - you will not be disappointed! Yet to try their Happy Hour - just afraid that I will be in big trouble not knowing when to stop eating at HH... lol"}
{"text":"Have been going to Yen for over 3 years and we have never been disappointed. Yuri and her team really make us feel at home remembering what our favourites are and recommending any new items or specials. We never go during happy hour as we prefer their main menu and always way less crowded. We have tried many other sushi bars here in town and found a few other good/great locations but find we return here more often than not!"}
{"text":"100th Review -- Very well deserved 5 starts goes to...  YEN SUSHI!  The happy hour here was amazing. We came here while waiting for a friend at the hospital and decided to grab sushi. We're used to great sushi in phoenix, tempe, scottsdale, etc. Never thought such tasty sushi could exist in Glendale, of all areas!  We sat outisde, which was nice, and were quickly served everything we could possibly ask for, promptly. They had nice chopsticks -- I remember these things. Anwyay, we always get eel rolls of some sort which were delicious. The edamame was tasty, the service was amazing, and the food was expertly made and fresh fresh fresh!  Would love to come back when I for some crazy reason end up on this side of town."}
{"text":"Never before on the mainland have I had sushi that has made me stop and really, and I mean, REALLY savor the flavors. Like the world slows down \"Matrix-style\", grinds to a halt. It's that good.  The last place that did that to me was a small place hidden in a business complex in Maui called Sensei, and since then, I have not had that experience.  Until now. Run out of strip-mall, a Korean Chef named Paul runs Yen Sushi & Sake Bar, and creates some of the most interesting and delicious sushi I have had the pleasure of having.  First off, the nigiri is very fresh, we had Spicy Scallops , Uni, & Smoked Salmon. The Spicy Scallops were exceptionally surprising, because the spicy sauce was not mayo-based, like EVERY OTHER SUSHI BAR EVER does. The result was nothing short of amazing.  The smoked salmon was melt-in-the-mouth delicious, and the Uni ranks as the best I have ever had. All roe, very sweet, and not over-powering at all.  For their Maki, we had the Heart Attack, which is basically the greatest Jalapeno Popper I have ever had. Extremely spicy Jalapeno, spicy tuna, real crab, and some sauces, deep-fried. Decadent.  Delicious.  Our other roll was one that was a mixture of fish, I believe tuna, mackeral ,crab, mountain carrot, a few other veggies, and some eel sauce. Very fresh, and incredibly awesome.  Delicious tea, and free miso, on top of an amazing atmosphere and an incredible chef, have made Yen the ONLY sushi bar that I will continually come back to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"God I miss this place. We started going about 2 months back and have been a regular there , at least once a week since finding it via Yelp. I'm in Scotland for three weeks and there's apparently nothing as good as this venue.   While this may not be important to people this was by far the \"fastest\" turnaround from order to table, flowed nicely and didn't end up like the usual traffic-accident-at-sushi-central  that we've had on the tiny tables at Tokyo Lobby, or the table shuffle dance at  Fresh Wasabe    The entrance shows an attention to detail that appears throughout the room.  I'm still new to sushi so the chance to try as much of it as I can for reasonable prices has been a winner.  After 8 o clock the happy hour,till close, has many interesting rolls for $5 and large Sapparos ,bottle,for $3.The latter is a public service that should be recognised by the good people of Phoenix and awarded a Yen Sushi day. Love the staff, the food's been great..   The sashimi tuna in garlic aioli sauce appetizer is amazing, yeah it's not cheap but with the happy hour on it pays off nicely to experiment. I can't wait till I'm back stateside again:)"}
{"text":"This place was so good!  The staff was on top of everything constantly, we never had to ask for a thing.  The food was AWESOME! and trust me fellow yelpers, we practically ordered everything on the menu.  We ordered noodles and ribs and rolls and rolls and rolls....you get the point!!!!  EVERYTHING was soooo good!  This place is a GEM!!!"}
{"text":"Yen Sushi is my favorite (korean style) sushi up in the N. phoenix area. Now mind you i have to give this stars based off of other places here in AZ.. If i was to grade them against sushi places i have been to in other places it would round out at 2 stars. But for this area yeah a four star.  Happy hour here is the best time to come, but also the worst. Best because the deals and the food. Worst because its PACKED! you gotta get here early if you can.   I definitely don't mind dropping by this place to hit my random sushi craving. Its good enough to satisfy my pallet.  Fried rolls are good, but their fresh rolls are better.  I enjoy the staff as well. They are willing to talk and joke with you and don't act like they have a stick up their butt."}
{"text":"Went around 3pm with a friend. Sat at a sushi bar. There were 2 other people sitting couple seats down. Where are sushi chefs? Maybe they went to have lunch...   We ordered hot tea to start. Where is the happy hour menu? Do you have to ask for it to get it? Anyway, we just had regular menu.  We ordered Tuna, Halibut, Salmon, Octopus sushi, Albacore sashimi, and Dragon Roll ($14.00) Shrimp tempura appetizer.  Few minutes later, sushi chef (Paul) came out. It was weird he didn't say anything. No greeting, no how are you doing, no \"irasshai\" (typical greeting in Japanese). He sliced albacore sashimi and served it to us. It had garlic ponzu sauce on it. It was tasty, but the garlic was over powering the actual fish flavor. Shrimp tempura came next. It was heavy and soggy. Tempura is supposed to be fluffy and crispy. Tuna sushi was next. I had one piece and gave my friend the rest (5 pieces). Fish itself tasted fine, but the way chef sliced it made it fishy. He sliced it along the grain, not against it. Same with Halibut. It was so thick I had to chew it for long time. Halibut is supposed to be very thin and melt in your mouth. It's also supposed to be served with citrus ponzu, but didn't. So I asked for it. They gave me garlic ponzu, the same sauce they had on albacore. Not the same. True ponzu sauce does not contain garlic. Dragon roll was last. I was wondering what made this roll $14.00. There were so much eel on it, I had to separate eel from actual roll and eat it separately.  Another sushi place that think bigger is better. No knowledge of art of sushi.   The whole time we were there, sushi chef said 1 word. \"How is everything?\" after we ate everything. Sushi chefs kept disappearing after he made our order. I sat at sushi bar to interact. But they kept going to waitress station and talking to themselves. Loud enough for me to know they all spoke Korean to each other. The 2 ladies sitting next to us didn't help the matter either as they were laughing so hard it sounded almost screaming. We were still hungry, but we did not feel welcome there, so we just left.   I tried it because they had such great reviews. My experience was not as good as other reviewers here."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Love the environment. Always busy and live inside . Weather it's to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch to go  or a date night , I would recommend this local spot. Convenient nice location.  Food is great and fresh. People are very attentive and kind. Ordered baked scallops with onion and mushrooms on a california roll And hubby ordered crazy boy roll and a few others . Highly recommend these 2 . They were delish."}
{"text":"For 20 years I have said I hated sushi, but my hairdresser just turned me onto this place and OMG!  I love sushi now! Between 3-5 pm is Happy Hour, and the Hostess had the good sense to give me that menu when I showed up a couple minutes past 5 by myself.  So, figuring the portions would be small, I ordered the Crispy Calamari and the Teriyaki Tuna Roll or close to that name.  Two words:  deeeeee-lisious!   And were the portions small?  Not by a long shot.  I ate what I ordered and waddled home...OMG!  It was filling. I totally take back everything I have said about Japanese food for years.  It can be delicious if made right, and this place definitely makes it right. This place is a real winner!  Will I go back?  You can bet on that one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have given this place three chances but each time has been terrible service. The waitresses are straight up awful. Food was good.. but waitresses = garbage. Will never come back."}
{"text":"This review is for the 3-5p happy hour:  Ehhhhhh.....  Maybe I'm a sushi snob, but what I do know is that deep-fried does not equal sushi. There were 6 \"sushi rolls\" to choose from their happy hour menu, ALL of which consisted of deep-fried shiet. I don't get it? The sushi chefs are Japanese, they should be legit. The crunch roll was absolutely miniscule, the spicy tempura tuna roll and the tempura shrimp roll both had the same sugary mayo sauce squirted all over them, the green tea ice cream was covered in chocolate sauce!   Disappointed after all these great Yelp reviews. Come to the happy hour if you want to get drunk. The rolls aren't even that cheap for what you get. Meh."}
{"text":"Only mediocre. Definitely won't be back, they did have a friendly staff and the service was good though."}
{"text":"A++, my favorite sushi place in the world. Amazing atmosphere, attentive staff and best of all...fresh sushi dishes. Thank you Yen."}
{"text":"I go here for one thing and one thing only.  Lunch bento box with Korean BBQ ribs, California roll or spicy tuna roll, served with tempura, salad, rice and miso soup.  It really is a nice option for a bento box.  These BBQ ribs are simply amazing, so tasty that it will make you lick your fingers clean afterwards.  Their sushi isn't too bad either, especially during happy hour.  Small restaurant with nice Asian decor inside; has a sushi bar with flat screen TV; friendly service.  5 stars for the bento box with Korean BBQ ribs. 3-4 stars for other items."}
{"text":"If you go here, go there during happy hour, which ends at 5pm (not sure when it starts). They have a nice selection of rolls and appetizers which is nice.  If you are looking to be served like you would in a western restaurant, think again. Remember that this is an Asian restaurant where they want to take care of you, yes, but they will not be nearly as personal as you would find, say, at a Carrabba's or Benihana's. They get your order, talk fast, and get to work.  The soda here is not by the tap, but by the can. After the second refill, you have to pay for another soda. Again, that is the asian style of doing the restaurant business.  The sushi really was ok, but the environment is what hurt it for me. This is not the place to have a nice, sweet date. The walls echo every sound and I was frustrated by some customers that didn't mind being quite loud in the restaurant. They really weren't being too considerate of the people around them and I have a feeling this is standard for this place. They do not attract the most professional customers, but customers that you mighty find in a place a step above subway.  The bar itself looked really nice, though. I will give it that.  The only reason for the two stars is simply because I was expecting a nice, comfortable place to have a date, and enjoy quality service. The food was good, but the overall experience of being there and trying to actually enjoy everything...well, it wasn't there for me.  I don't like leaving reviews like this, but that's that. I know this place would be perfect for others, though. It is good sushi and you can get it quick."}
{"text":"Like most gems in Phoenix, Yen sushi is cleverly hidden in a strip mall.  Don't be deceived by it's dark tinted windows.  The sushi is always fresh and the staff is generally responsive.  It gets pretty busy on Thursday - Saturday around 6:30 - 8:30, so be sure to arrive a bit early or be prepared for a wait.  Also, their happy hour is decent with rolls priced at less than $6 each."}
{"text":"This place is great. I stopped in for lunch and ordered a spicy tuna toll, shrimp tempura roll, and some salmon and tuna sashimi. All was excellent. The sashimi pieces are nice and thick. The service is the fastest for sushi that I have ever had.. and I sat at the sushi bar and watched them make the food so I know it was fresh.  Great service, atmosphere and food.  I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"great food all around. presentation of the sushi also great. the fish is always fresh. been back to this place many time. and so far, this is one of the best sushi in town. the only catch is, this place is not cheap.  you can spend $50 easy for lunch on a couple of nigiri. one thing though, skip the udon."}
{"text":"I owe this place a review years ago! They have the best lunch special! $8.99 for salad, rice, tempura and a cut roll with your choice of protein (chicken, salmon, spicy pork or kalbi for a couple of bucks more)! Also, for the price, quality and amount of fish that you get for sashimi, it's unbeatable. I had one of the best yellowtail sashimi's here. If you're on the low carb diet then their rock n roll roll is one of the best cucumber wrapped rolls have tried. The owner is cool and the servers are really friendly and nice. Never had an issue with service. Their Happy hour is solid too!"}
{"text":"This place is fan-freakin-tastic. It's a hole in the wall. Maybe 7 or 8 tables. But seriously, the food is so delicious! Omg... Where to start! The happy hour menu is seriously good, and they have this crispy rice roll that is so interesting. It's deep fried rice with spicy tuna on top. Yum-o. Shits about to get real though when I tell you about the one item I eat every time I go there. Heart-attack!!!! First thing I do when I eat this is try and not look like an idiot. They don't have forks at a sushi place, well they prolly do but I'm not going to be the only person to actually ask for one. But really? Two sticks to eat rice? How did those win out?! Secondly, I try not to cry because it's so good. Anywho, the reason I try not to look like and idiot is because the pieces they cut are giant! Three bites all rolled into one delicious piece of heaven. It's a tempura roll with jalapeño, cream cheese and other mouthwatering ingredients. So i see myself choking on this every time I go to yen..but the taste is so overwhelming awesome. Don't bite it in half either, I tried this once and the other half landed in my wasabi/soy sauce bowl and made a huge splash everywhere. But in all seriousness, please go there and try it and think of me when you do, because you will also try and eat this in one bite and visions of choking will also cross your thoughts. Chew and enjoy this amazing piece of deliciousness in the west valley."}
{"text":"Rolls and sushi were delicious. Nice waitstaff. Professional chefs. Would go back any day. Love it."}
{"text":"Food was good the only thing I was annoyed about was that they didn't have a wide enough selection of sushi and that the restroom was out of order."}
{"text":"YEN! This Place is very good. The Happy Hour Prices are Awesome and lots of sushi to chose from! happy hour starts at 8pm- get there early because yes there is always a long wait. The Rock and Roll is my fave. The place is always pack so i never complain about the the waiters not coming to us every 5-10min so be warned and be nice."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and great service/atmosphere. Their portions were big and I totally over-ordered but everything was so good. I would love to come back again and try everything they have!"}
{"text":"I'm someone who does not like anything fishy, but I went bravely to Yen's for my first sushi experience upon recommendations from family & friends. They were right, it was great! The tempura calimari roll made me a fan. I went big & tried the raw trio and found I actually liked the tuna. There is a good deal was soup & a Cali or spicy tuna roll (or raw trio) plus choice of another roll for $8.99, and it was more than I could finish eating. Overall: good food, good price, good quantity."}
{"text":"They have in my opinion, the best sushi at the best prices, especially the lunch menu.  I probably go there at least three times a week! Service is excellent as well. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"I was looking through my recent check in's and realized that I never reviewed Zen Sushi?!? I've been here probably 10 times! Well I'm finally getting around to a review.   I love Zen. It's one of the best sushi restaurants in town. Their happy hour is excellent with $5 sushi rolls. Granted all of the rolls are deep fried but they are huge and taste great. A bonus is the $5 sake bombers too!  Reverse Happy hour starts at 8 and runs until close.   I also love the Rainbow roll and the yellowtail sashmi. Very fresh and tender. I usually order a combination of menu items as well as a few happy hour rolls. I totally recommend the calamari roll which includes several giant strips if fried calamari.   Service is also excellent at Yen. The other day we came in 10 mins before closing (we thought it closed at 10) and the staff still sat us and took our order without rushing us. Very nice and I honestly expected them to turn us away at the door.   If your in the NW area and are craving sushi come here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When it's sushi time (about once a week) this is our go to consistently fresh and good Sushi place.  If we are not experimenting with new places and want to stay close to home, we know we can depend on Yen!!!"}
{"text":"This place was Awesome from the sushi itself to the friendly and prompt service. We tried the Sunset roll, rattlesnake as well as eel and tuna nigiri. All Amazing.  The Cosmo I ordered was good but not traditionally made. Seem like it had soju or sake in it. We finished with the chocolate caramel which was the chocolate mousse pyramid and it was great too. Must try this great sushi restaurant! Next time we plan to hit the happy hour time. 3-5pm or 8-close."}
{"text":"This place is in a strip mall.  It has an OK ambiance.  The Miso soup we ordered came to us Luke warm to cold, not good.  We ordered the salmon scallop roll which was not so good and the rattlesnake roll which was much better.  The service was OK, however the sushi chef kept having to flag down the server when the food was ready, kind of like the server just didn't care about us but rather the big screen TV with the football game on.  I don't think we will be going back, this is a good place but lacks the appeal for us."}
{"text":"It's a great place, We've tried a lot of sushi places (not by choice) and always end up coming right back here. The food is worth the 12 mile trip from our house alone but it is also in good portions and simply delightful tastes. It's never lacking in flavor or presentation. Sometimes the greeting service is a little slow, but we usually go during happy hour and they get quite busy, so understandable. But once you are seated, it is very quick and each server helps each other out so you can ask anyone for anything and they don't make you feel like you're bothering them. We prefer Jasmine, as she always has a smile and recognizes us right away. She makes comfortable small talk without being too much. But they are all very good. We really recommend this place to anyone just looking for a nice and enjoyable meal all around."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new sushi place after having a bad experience at our old local place, Kabuki.  So after 'Yelping' it, we found this place.  When walking in, it had the nice smell of.. a hair and nail salon.  Oddly there were none around.  Once walking in, you definitely got the nice aroma of sushi around you.  And No, not the fishy smell.    We sat and ordered the drinks.  heads up.. if you want soda, this place is not on fountain  yet, so get ready to pay $1.50 a can.  Glad I drank iced tea.   So my review is based on the food alone.  I had probably the best Rainbow Roll I have ever eaten.  It was so good.. that after I was done, i ordered another one.    I usually get the edemame, but there's wasnt that great.  It wasnt bad, it just didint 'wow' me.    Would I go here again? Definitely.   This place is really packed.. which is so odd because it's not in a great location.  Good food I guess! :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Very reasonable and fresh. Crispy rice spicy tuna and garlic albacore roll fantastic."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great for drinks, but could stand to be expanded a bit on the food side.  With that said, the food itself is delicious and very reasonably priced even outside of happy hour. I'd recommend the spicy tuna salad - delicious and a great value for how much you get."}
{"text":"I used to live right around the corner of this place.  I would say lunch specials are really good. Everyone is very friendly here. Dinner rolls are somewhat expensive. But definitely recommend people to come here."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi with higher end prices than you should find at a local sushi plac."}
{"text":"I write this review with sadness, as this was my go-to sushi restaurant over the last two years.    SUMMARY:   Long delays, delievered wrong order, mediocre food, billed for the wrong order, more delays waiting to correct my bill.    DETAILS:   The wait staff was not knowledgable and were not attentive. The food (curry udon and salmon teriyaki) was OK at best, but then we had massive waits in order to be served.  After a very long wait the food arrived, bringing the wrong plate which was then sent back.   We then waited....and waited...and waited some more.   As we finished our lunch, I gave my credit card prior to the bill as I (correctly) anticipated further delays.  They charged me for the other salmon dish that they brought by mistake, and I then had to wait another :10 for them to credit my card and get my correct bill.  I can't take :90 lunches especially with poor service and mediocre sushi."}
{"text":"We decided to sit outside since it was soooo loud inside, the waitresses (plural) were so rude...we asked for extra glass of water...rude again...and said since we decided to sit outside we would not get proper service...we had a couple seated at the same time, they left the restaurant before we were served water..!!!...they served our food finally and almost threw it on the table...checked on us once...Their was not a smile out of either two of the waitresses...if you have tables outside, are they not for eating..???...but we left a $6.00 tip...we will not be back..."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu. We love coming here for reverse happy hour. Very affordable great atmosphere friendly service excellent sushi"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood sushi spot. Whenever I'm in the area I always come by.  You can't beat their happy hour prices that run the majority of the day."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. First of all almost all the rolls here are super Americanized. There is a crunchy rice roll on the happy hour menu and I suggest you stay away from it. My friend and I both got sick after eating here and it was some of the worst selection of sushi rolls I have seen in a long time. Almost everything is baked or fried. Very few fresh sushi roll options."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, fresh and carefully prepared sushi at this restaurant. The service is polite, quick and professional. Great place for sushi!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten really good reviews so I had to put this restaurant on my short list of places to check out.  I have come here twice in the past week, first was for a late lunch, and the second time was dinner with friends.  Both times were great, I love the feel here.  Feels like an authenic sushi restaurant, not that I know what that means, just doesn't feel like a glamarous overated place like you'd see in Scottsdale.  The employees fit the title, inside is decorated appropiately and oh that sushi comes out fresh, tasty, and with style.   This is my favorite place so far in AZ, I will be back again in no time."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi joint! The food is always fresh and delicious! Hot night roll is my favorite. Happy hour has great deals!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 4 out of 5.   I'm docking off 1 star because the sushi isn't great here. Sad, but true. The quality of the fish isn't to my standards for a restaurant to have the word 'sushi' in its name. It's edible, but not good quality. The uni (sea urchin) is probably the only thing that's legit. HOWEVER, they aren't stingy on how much they give. Nice decent thickness to their fish, piled on uni on the uni sushi, etc.  Their cooked foods are pretty darn good!! BIG FAN of the lunch menu.... esp. the BBQ ribs. It's soo tasty and only around $8-9 during lunch! It comes with two vegetable tempura and dip, 4 pieces of sushi roll (I picked spicy tuna, but you can choose California roll), salad, a little rice, BBQ ribs, and miso soup.  Great deal for this tasty dish!   I will be back."}
{"text":"I feel so bad cheating on my beloved Tokyo Lobby, but Yen is pretty darn good.   Definitely go during happy hour. Their rolls and appetizers are only 5 dollars each.   We ordered the calamari roll, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna on top of crispy rice and crazy boy roll. They were all fabulous!   They also brought us complimentary miso soup.   We arrived at 7:45pm and the place was dead. By the time happy hour started at 8:00pm, the place started to fill up. By the time we left, around 8:45pm, the place was packed!   The only thing I would say is, they need more servers. We had to flag someone down to refill our waters and take our check several times.   Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi bar. Best you can find in the area for the price. Very small location but never too busy or crowded. Their happy hour is amazing, great prices and even better selection! Haven't found something me or my friends haven't liked yet. Service is ALWAYS quick and friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG THIS IS MY 500th REVIEW!  HOLY COW I CAN\"T BELIEVE I MADE IT THIS FAR! Plus, it was my birthday on Tuesday the 12th, which makes it an even BETTER week!  But, here's how our Friday afternoon happy celebration went:  So a bunch of us girls decided to do happy hour after work today, and one of my coworkers suggested this place. I don't eat sushi often, and usually need help ordering since I have no clue what I'm doing!  Upon entering, I really liked how the place was set up. Cute tables, with a great Asian flare.  Not flashy, but not understated either. My friends helped me order off the happy hour menu, and the food was delicious! I went with a deep fried california roll, along with another dish that I split with my friend. I can't remember the name of it, but I do know it had pink fish on top with white rice underneath.  The service was a bit slow at first, but eventually got better as the night went on. We were getting antsy to order, and kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting some more. Eventually the service picked up, but it took a little bit. We had a big table and there were lots of mouths to feed, so it was evened out in the end.  Overall, I was happy with eating here.  Plenty of food, great menu, and amazing happy hour prices.  Place was packed, so get there early so you can get a seat and get your grub on from 3-5."}
{"text":"Many times came to this sushi place when visiting Arizona for business.  Normaly order a dragon roll which comes with whole piece of eel on top. This time a little disapointed because of the eel sauce on top.  Besides the eel sauce that made a roll taste a little weird and sweet everything is good."}
{"text":"my friends and I went here for the first time last night and we were VERY happy! Their happy hour menu is fantastic! we got the philly roll, crazy boy, spicy tuna tempura, and shrimp tempura. They were all really delicious and had sooo much flavor. This place blew RA out of the water.  the location is eh, but the sushi is FAB!   the staff was really nice. I asked for extra ginger and boy, they weren't stingy at all! Oh and their prices are great!  Thank goodness we found this place because I'm a fan and will be back. NO MORE KOI for meeeeee :) YAYERRR!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while traveling on business; I like to check out local sushi places where I go, and this one had pretty good reviews.   I would give this place 2.5 stars, if Yelp allowed half-stars, but I decided to round down, rather than up, because nothing really impressed me about this place. I ordered a big Kirin Ichiban beer, seaweed salad, small sashimi combo platter, and green tea mochi ice cream.  Turned out to be a big meal for one person.  The seaweed salad was much bigger than most places serve, which confused me, as I didn't want to fill up on seaweed.  It was $8.00, and had a sliver of crab on top of it.  Weird.  The sashimi was rather good; the small platter had 5 pieces each of octopus, albacore, fatty tuna, yellowfin, and salmon.  This is more sashimi than a typical small combo, and the price tag was higher, too ($28.00).  The individual sashimi orders on the menu were 7-8 pieces each, and most were $10.95.  What irked me was the albacore.  It had been seared in a previous life, with some weird spices, then chilled, giving it a hard outer crust and limp interior.  It reminded me of lunchmeat.  Not good. Not many sushi places offer the mochi ice cream - I was happy to see they had 'em.   Overall, decent quality fish, prices are rather high, chefs are pleasant...better than many sushi places in Phoenix.  I'm still searching for the sushi Mecca in that area, though."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi spot for lunch. I sit at the sushi bar, and Paul, the chef is friendly and obviously has a great memory (Or....I eat there way too often!).  I don't even need to order anymore. I walk in, they bring me the large starter salad (the delicious ginger dressing is my new fav). Then comes the Rock and Roll riceless roll with extra ginger. I've been there twice when the sushi chefs bring out huge fish, and filet it into sashimi pieces right in front of you. I was fascinated! I kept taking photos of him throughout the process, which he thought was hilarious. I definitely recommend this place - fresh and great happy hour drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Yen is the best, don't bother eating sushi elsewhere. I've tried, and nothing compares to yen. The staff here are friendly and the food is wonderful, what more could you want!  My husband is a professional deep sea fisherman and before that a crabber. So I would say he knows a thing or two about good fresh fish. I took him here dragging his feet because he doesn't like eating sea food anywhere that's not coastal. He was impressed. Actually the words that came out of his mouth were \"this is some of the best crab I've ever had\". To eat some of the best crab one has ever had when you've had ALOT says something. This place is definitely worth a try if you haven't already. Make sure you get here in off hours before lunch or dinner because it is a very small restaurant."}
{"text":"I appreciate the great service. Excellent Sushi Chiefs, and quality of product. I have been coming to this fantastic establishment for a long time and have brought many new customers along with me and they are loyal followers of the YEN!!  Don't take my word for it try it. Sushi when appreciated for the complex flavors and how quality product make all the difference here is your place."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food came out on a timely manner. Price is reasonable. No complain here."}
{"text":"I have been getting sushi from yen for years, however the service continues to lack basic skills in being attentive and polite to the customers. It is surprising that even with servers changing over time that the customer service still fails in my opinion. The sushi on the other hand is good and fresh."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it so much yesterday had to bring my gal back. Some Miso Soup, another helping of the Rainbow Roll (selected fish) fished by Baked Lobster Tail Special Roll! Absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"I am from CA and have good sushi available at my fingertips. I visit AZ once a month and like to try different/new sushi spots in the Phoenix area. I will say that THIS IS THE BEST sushi I have had in AZ and thee only place that I will return. I have to agree with others that the happy hour prices for drinks were amazing. The rolls were fresh and well made: Rainbow Roll, Crazy Boy Roll, Phoenix Roll, Rattlesnake, Salmon Tempura Roll. I was so happy and pleased on the fresh cool taste of the phoenix roll. The Rattlesnake was GREAT. I love a eel and ell sauce. It was like home eating a Dragon or Caterpillar Roll. I will be back with a bigger stomach wanting to try these rolls again or new ones."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a quite while but I tried again yesterday. I think their $5 happy hour is a pretty good deal. We went after 8pm and I think they have happy hour from 8 to close. (They have 2 happy hours but I'm not sure about the other one). I like all the rolls they have and for $5 you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Great!!!  Been here many times.  Sushi is great, as is the lovely iced tea...green or regular.  They made it bigger ( well, not in that way), and can fit many more people.  Owner and cute girls that work there are very nice.    Sushi great, nice deal, but gets busy.  All in all, very tasty and fresh sushi.  I find the vegetable gyoza simply divine.  I would go so far as to say, this is the best sushi on the West side of town.  No pretentious sushi gimmicks, just great sushi at a reasonable price.   \"Sometimes, it ok to pay full price and less busy.\" Confucius, 570 BC"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Yen for years. We've tried numerous sushi restaurants and nothing holds a candle to Yen. I swear they have a magical avocado tree in the back because they are so creamy and delicious!! Yen's consistency is on point. We've literally never, not once, had a bad experience there. The staff is great and the sushi chefs are always making everyone feel welcome the second they walk in the door. They've got gluten free soy sauce as well so that's a major plus for me! I can't imagine finding anywhere better than Yen for sushi."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week.  Easily the best and freshest sushi in Arizona, California and Mexico.  Paul is a master at selecting fish.  His sauces are awesome and very flavorful. Shashimi - please Rolls - yep Sushi - yes yes yes Happy Hour - worth it Green Ice Tea - their own blend.  Good for what ails you."}
{"text":"I think I've found one of the best sushi spots in the West Valley. The fish was fresh, the service impeccable, lots of choices. I absolutely LOVED this place and so did my guest. Yen Sushi will be my go to sushi spot when I venture out west...Wish they'd open a spot in the East..."}
{"text":"Yen Sushi was my first sushi experience and I was amazed. I started coming here about three years ago with my boyfriend and the place has been getting better and bigger. It is amazing seeing a small business expand and get even busier. Their happy hour prices are great and the food is always amazing. My favorite is the crazy boy roll. The customer service is very attentive and I have had a wonderful experience each time that I go."}
{"text":"The staff here themselves make Yen such a great place to eat!  For saucy, mixture of fix in's in your sushi type of rolls, this is the place. Got two rolls here to share- Caterpillar and Unagi (I believe) and Shrimp Tempura.  The caterpillar rolls was good, fresh avocado and almost melt in your mouth. It was that good. The unagi was good, flavorful, fresh and moist, though it had too much sauce at some points.  The service was great. Loved seeing the sushi chefs at work, the server helping us- who spoke Korean was such a delight and probably the happiest waiter I've ever came across! I was a waitress before and I don't think I had that much energy- ever.   I need to come back to check out their sashimi and nigiri because the pics look amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. They have spectacular lunch specials, but the food is to die for any time of the day. The people are friendly and the service is on pointe."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because of the reviews here on yelp. It has a nice set up. The happy hour specials are great. The sushi had good flavor. The dipping sauce for the tempura was spot on. Sakebombers, awesome. They even had a cool twist on the green tea ice cream. The only downfall was that my waitress could have been a little more attentive."}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewers are all happy about. Went with my girlfriend to this place based on the reviews. The sushi is mediocre at best. The chief special, don'tcry roll, was a joke. It was horribly put together and my girlfriend who can eat sushi everyday, wouldn't finish it. The service was rushed and barely there. We asked for saratcha and never received it. The only reason I am giving two stars is because their watermelon cocktail was very good. Everything else was mediocre, and for spending a hundred dollars on sushi, I expect better. We will stick with Kabuki."}
{"text":"Prices increased. Quality drastically decreased.   The rolls are half of what they used to be. You need to remind the servers a few times to bring your drink refills, sauces.   Edema arrived after sushi.  Servers need to smile. Sadly, Yen is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Casual and comfortable, Yen isn't a see-and-be-seen place, but it sure hits the spot when you're craving some sushi. And for the record, it does have quite a bit more ambiance (read low lighting, muted decor, and pillowed benches) than several other places of its size and relative location.  Let's get to the important stuff: the food. I've been here a few times and never had anything less than fresh, quality fish. Toro, Sake, Hamachi, we've had it sashimi style and in funky-good rolls. Unagi and Tuna tataki are top notch, too. Among my favorites are the Sunset Roll (crab mix and avocado roll topped with salmon, sliced lemon, and rooster sauce), and the heart attack (think jalapeno poppers stuffed with seafood).  They have great happy hour discounts on drinks and food, but for me the hh menu is a little one-dimensional with mostly tempura items. I love me a deal, but I would suggest mixing in a few regular menu items to round out the experience.  Oh, and don't dine here if you're in a time crunch. The service has always been courteous, friendly - and beyond slow. I usually enjoy a slower pace, but it's nice to have a full water glass and a drinky-poo to help pass the time."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi always fresh- whenever we try a new spot my husband and I always say- \"why didn't we go to Yen?\""}
{"text":"This place is located next door to a nail salon.  The smell is overwhelming.  The acetone and other strong chemicals used at that salon carry over into the restuarant.  I am sorry for them.  We were there 8/15/11 for happy hour.  Food was average.  Service was average.  All just average.  I think others give this place high stars because they have no other sushi options in this area.  They don't know what they are missing.  There is nothing special about Yen.  And the chemical smell from their neighbor was so strong that we will never go there again.  I don't know who was there first, but if Yen wants to stay, I hope the nail place relocates."}
{"text":"Yen is by far in my top 3 sushi bars. The staff are always friendly and chef Paul makes some tasty rolls. Happy hour rolls are a bit limited (I hope they add more), but they are delicious. My favorite is their Philly roll. Most places put cucumber or carrot, but Yen uses asparagus instead and wow what a difference. The calamari roll is very good (texture is not rubbery like other places I've been too *cough* Kabuki). If you want a roll without rice I recommend the rock and roll. This roll has salmon/tuna/avocado wrapped in cucumber. The chef uses skewers to hold them in place which makes for an interesting plating. This is a great little place and with amazing quality sushi."}
{"text":"We had never heard of Yen Sushi before some family members took us here for happy hour one evening.  Wow, what a hidden gem we were missing out on!    We probably ordered enough food for 10 people... and the 4 of us ate it all. It was all amazing. The presentation of the food really stood out to me. The Calamari Roll (my absolute favorite) even comes with a few fried calamari on the side! What a deal!   Inside it feels cozy and welcoming, and the staff was all extremely friendly.  I have a feeling Yen Sushi is going to become a regular place for us!"}
{"text":"Its pretty rare to find a decent sushi restaurant in phoenix that stays consistent with their quality of food and customer service.  This is a restaurant that stays true to their customers and really pride on their customer service.   Highly recommend everyone to get a true taste of how a sushi restaurant should be.  Rock & Roll roll is a must to try!"}
{"text":"Amazing is all I can say. We started with happy hour. 5$ saki bombs and 5$ sushi rolls. We tried the tempura salmon roll and the Philadelphia. Both were spectacular. My entrée was the salmon plate. At 14$ it was worth every penny. I was given two huge pieces of salmon that was seared in teriyaki.   This is by far the best sushi place I have ever been to. And could u imagine it's in the middle of the desert??  Just amazing. I can't wait to come back and stuff my face again at this place.   Make sure you come during happy hour to get the great deals on the best sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"Fantastic food as a good price! I have been here a few times now and I am fan of both their sushi and bento box lunch menus! Sushi is very fresh and flavorful (unlike other places where it all tastes the same, each roll is very unique). In addition, if you are looking for a quick lunch, stop by before 3 PM and have a lunch combo which is fantastic. In most cases there was only one server but she was very prompt with refills, soups and making her presence known (which brings to questions why other waiters/waitresses have problems managing 2 or 3 tables!) Will be coming back very shortly!"}
{"text":"Friends and I were craving for udon / Ramen and decided to eat out.  We had just bailed out of a different restaurant because of a near death experience and we are happy to have found this place.   Good amount of lighting, well decorated, quite clean, the staff was super polite and nice, and the place smelled well.   We were promptly seated and our drinks were ordered immediately.  We each ordered the Nabeyaki Udon which was pretty good.  Mines was a little salty, but it's okay, I didn't die.  We also order a few rolls along with it.    Great place, I believe we will come back in the near future."}
{"text":"Best time to go is during happy hour when Paul, the owner, is working. If you like sushi, this place is a must try. It's hard to find decent sushi in Arizona, and Yen is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Best sushi you will find in AZ. I have been coming here for years. They are a little pricey, but if you go during happy hour they have delicious rolls for $5. My daughter was hooked on sushi at age 5 because of Yen.  Can't stop, won't stop, they will always be my fave."}
{"text":"Not very impressed as it had 4 stars. Service wasn't the greatest. Food was mediocre. Took a long time just to get situated with the orders. I order the spicy tuna tempura roll which was ok, wish it had more spicy mayo on it as it was a bit dry. Not a place I would rave about returning again."}
{"text":"We love this place!  My husband turned me on to Sushi and I am still exploring lots of options but this place is by far the best we've found in the Valley.    It can get very crowded and quiet noisy.  We avoid Friday and Saturday nights after 8:00pm when their happy hour kicks in again. The noise level makes it difficult to have a conversation.     We did have one experience that could have been handled better but you can NOT beat the sushi.  I would certainly suggest you try it."}
{"text":"Yen sets the bar for any other sushi restaurant in the valley! Always the freshest fish, superior service, affordable prices, and casual atmosphere. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Pros: - the sweet water eel Chirashi was a true delicacy. The eel was very fresh and impeccably prepared with just the right amount of sauce. - 911 rolls were OK - impeccable service  Cons: - weird mall location, somewhat hidden/hard to find"}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing. Tried the salmon skin salad for the first time. That was incredible... Of you want to just eat something light and just drink, then this is the dish."}
{"text":"It is a nice place to have some sushi , but really overpriced . And service is not the best or fast . Been there a few times would rather go somewhere els."}
{"text":"We love this place! We eat here at least twice a month! The food is great as is the service. The sashimi is fresh and cold and the beer is ice cold! Nice atmosphere too! This is in a strip mall and it is easy to miss. It does not look like much from the outside but you are pleasantly surprised when you enter the doors. After reading some of the other reviews,  I think the trick to the service being good or poor is when you go. We never go during happy hour. It is not busy when we are there, therefore we have good service."}
{"text":"Great sushi, friendly staff, and amazing mochi ice cream! They also have a really great happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"We went back the second time around it was just as good as the first. We had the stuffed jalapeño and some other sushi haut wanted to share some pics."}
{"text":"I solely picked this place because of the reviews it had and close to our house. The moment we walked in we were greeted, sat down and given our first drink. All within minutes. Both my girlfriend and I had great service overall and prices were reasonable. Quiet and lovely ambience which made it not like any typical franchise sushi place. Will be back again as we were overall happy with the service, price and food!"}
{"text":"We go there for date night and ask to sit outside. They take our ID away to make sure we \"don't dash and run\". That's classy!!! Then we order a roll at full price, not at happy hour, and I ask to remove the mayo because of my dairy allergy and the waitress says she will charge me $2 more to put crab sticks (whatever that is) instead of mixed crab with mayo. So I said just remove it and sub with salmon which was in the roll as a second ingredient. She said \"no we don't do substitutions. We can replace with cucumbers \". I'm sorry but that is the worst service ever. It's not the $2, it's the principle. Never going there again! And the servings our tiny. We got the tuna roll and for $6 it was so small it could fit up my nostril!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying I love Yen. We have a standing Friday afternoon tradition of heading to Yen during their afternoon happy hour (3-5) and throwing down as much $5 rolls and Sake as we can in the time we have.  They have a happy hour menu that contains maybe 10-15  $5 items including the kids favorite Crazy Boy Roll. The menu has something for everyone and the $3 large Sake is a nice touch too.   I have had lots of mediocre Sushi in Phoenix and some way over priced decent sushi and yen is good sushi for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Terrific sushi restaurant! Went on a Friday night and there was a late night happy hour from 8-close. The happy hour menu is quite extensive; there were probably over 30 rolls on the HH menu. I'm not s big seafood person at all so I basically got two variations of the California roll: the Craze Boy Roll and the Chili Crab Roll. Both were on point! Nice consistency, flavor and freshness.   The service was friendly and the food was prepared fast. Overall, a very good sushi option with great HH specials."}
{"text":"Good God, where has this been hiding? My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem. From his kids, no less.   We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night. We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us. Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away. The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that?   The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember). OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD. This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi!   Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, that's with the tip included, no less...YAY! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"YEN whoops all other PHX sushi bars boo-tays.  Big time.   Heres why:  Freshest fish Unassuming, genuinely nice chefs and staff amazing prices huge selection fast..very fast. Especially since I recently fell out of love with Yasu when I placed a to-go order that they quoted me 30 minutes on and then when I arrived, they told me it would be another hour. (BOO on them, and yes I am still bitter) Thank god my search for a better place is over! No more of them acting like they are doing me a favor by waiting on me!! They also dont act like you are crazy when you roll up in there on a whim wanting a few rolls...  GO YEN! YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum!  I am a huge sushi fan and eat some type of sushi every week! I really enjoyed my experience and would recommend this place to any sushi lover. There is a large selection of fish and rolls and the prices were not jumping off of the menu. The fish is very fresh and quite frankly, when its 115 degrees outside and 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean, the quality and freshness was great!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town hands down if I'm craving sushi this place is the place to go try there sunset roll very good if you like salmon fish is always fresh customer service is good just in general this place is a gem"}
{"text":"Went today with a friend and we had a great lunch.  We started with the edamame and ordered 3 rolls.  The first to arrive was the shrimp and soy paper roll.  It was very good it had big pieces of shrimp with some crab and asparagus in it.  They topped it with a creamy sauce that made me not even use my soy sauce for dipping.  We then got the our next two rolls which were the heart attack roll and the shrimp tempura roll.  They were both very good and again covered in a sauce that tasted great with the roll.  We both left very happy and full."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My husband and I come as often as we can and we're never disappointed. We also did our wedding dinner here, and the accommodations were amazing!"}
{"text":"I tried several different rolls between my boyfriend and I. Sushi was good and it felt safe which is always in the back of my mind when consuming something raw from the ocean...in the middle of the desert.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the staff would not let my boyfriend and I look over the menu in peace. We had 3 different people ask us multiple times each if we were ready to order. I understand you want to be attentive, but you have a lot of choices and I'm trying to decide what will be the best for me :)  I will be back and try to be less annoyed about attentive customer service lol.  Side Note: its freezing in here so bring a sweater. Accept the chilly temperature by picturing yourself eating raw fish in a muggy little restaurant. Gross."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, my party went there for happy hour. I had friendly service and reasonable beverage pricing. The major disappointment was that they have mostly tempura (fried) sushi on the happy hour menu. Only one item wasn't fried (Philadelphia roll). Won't go back unless they change this up."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in the Valley. Has to be the best and freshest sushi I have had here. Three of us went in after 9pm on a Friday night. The best part about rolling in late was the reverse happy hour. Nice list of rolls, appetizers and beverages at happy hour prices.  We picked up an app and a couple rolls off the menu. We also ordered a small sashimi sampler and a plate of yellow fin tataki with chile. I am still daydreaming about the freshness and the clean flavors of the sashimi and tataki.   The restaurant is in a shopping center but it offered ample parking. The place was packed when we arrived but we didn't wait long to get a table (about 5 minutes)."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time yesterday with a friend for lunch.  What a great place!  Wonderful food and so affordable.  This is better than some of the higher priced places, I've been to.  The ambiance is perfect for a date night or just a quiet time with friends noshing on your favorite sushi.  Fabulous wait staff and such a clean and tidy place!   Quaint, cozy, hidden away,  Just a neat spot fir great sushi.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go for great fresh sushi and Japanese cuisine. Small place but great atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars depending on the night you go!  Love this place because of the happy hour, they have an evening one and a late-night one. I started coming here 2 years ago when I first moved to AZ and being a California native, this was the ONLY place in Glendale that came close to California quality sushi. Yen was my go to sushi spot until Sushi Catcher opened up right by my apartment and replaced it as my favorite sushi place in the area... Its ok! I'll be back! I like the different fusion sushi rolls here (Hawaiian roll, sunset roll, spicy tuna tempura roll, lobster roll, yellow tail scallion) but the sashimi is hit or miss, you really can taste a difference depending on which day of the week you go. The have good drink specials with sake, and their green tea tempura icecream is delish.   Its a fairly small restaurant and service is quick and efficient. A little on the pricier side but its worth the price."}
{"text":"Good place to get drunk during the happy hour.  Happy hour rolls are deep fried.  Run down bathroom.  Just not what I was expecting from such a highly rated place."}
{"text":"Well, I'm going to make it official: I like this place.   Food wise, I'm always on-board for the Nabeyaki Udon, and have been especially enjoying it on chilly days as of late. (only way it could be better is: two tempura shrimp instead of one and that the shrimp is served on the side so it doesn't have a chance to get soggy. Request it as such!)   Hub likes a double by-pass (i.e. TWO heart attack rolls) and though deep-fried sushi isn't so much my thing, I agree that this item is delicious. And, just a note, most happy hour selections have a deep-fried component. Drink specials on happy hour are decent as well. (Like $3 for large sake.)   All the maki / sushi we've tried here has been fresh and tasty and a reasonable value. There are other menu choices like katsu chicken that have done the trick as well.   The service is always delightful.   At first, I didn't care for the layout of the place but the ambiance, food and service (plus a recent table by the window, even though it's just a parking lot view) have done wonders to dispel any hesitation about dining here regularly."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi happy hours I have ever seen.  It's not the biggest place so make sure you get here a bit early to get a good table.  All the happy hour items we had were delicious.  Service was adequate."}
{"text":"Love this place, we have been twice in the last week and will be headed there today.  Sushi taste fresh and ohhh so yummy.  Love the sunset roll."}
{"text":"Took my sister out for her first time having sushi. The sashimi combo was delicious. 5 pieces of 5 types of sushi and 2 bottles of hot house sake. We loved it! Very helpful and friendly staff. Excellent experience! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.    First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly.   The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good.  The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide \"2.5 dollar signs\".  Granted, I did not come for \"Happy Hour\" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper.  Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, I've been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.    So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was \"ok\".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree."}
{"text":"Sushi is actually really good.  Service is terrible especially the hostess.  Unwilling to accommodate any party over 4 on two separate occasions."}
{"text":"has anyone else played Diner Dash?  i had the music and images of my finger dragging customers to tables, taking orders, and delivering food. two waitresses and servers for a restaurant of 10-12 tables and a handful of sushi bar spots. for some tables -- like ours --i could see the smoke coming out of our ears as we were waiting to order!   but i digress.  for phoenix, four stars. lumped into sushi restaurants as a whole, 3 stars.   excellent value for money (45 piece sashimi platter for $45 is your best bet) and mostly fresh fish. some cuts of fish were better than others, but in general, i did have to drown them in wasabi to cut the taste of fishi-ness. you will be spoiled for choice with the sushi roll menu, and their servings are generous. nothing super memorable.   i might go back if i had a super sushi craving."}
{"text":"Thank god we finally found a good sushi place in Phoenix.  I thought it would never happen.  We had the Heart Attack, the Calamari Tempura Roll, The Rattlesnake, Soft Shell Crab, and a couple of Kirin.  OK.  The Heart Attack is amazing.  I mean, seriously.  It's like everything that is good about Jalapeno Poppers and everything that is good about a good roll all mixed up into one.  While the Calamari Tempura and the Soft Shell Crab Rolls were good - they always are - the Rattlesnake was the best.  I have a secret love for Freshwater Eel, but this roll capitalized on it and it was tremendous.    I do kinda wish we had gotten there before 5 or after 8 so we had been able to take advantage of Happy Hour - every day from 3-5 and 8-close (cuz they have $5 rolls and drinks!) but, even though we spent more than we wanted, it was well worth it.    I will DEFINITELY be going back."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great atmosphere, similar to Yasu in that regard.  Great sushi and lots of great rolls.  Fun spot."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant often, the sushi is fresh and they have a great happy hour menu. Just know it is very popular at happy hour but it's worth the wait. Great atmosphere low lights and very relaxing."}
{"text":"Been here twice now- once for dinner and once for lunch. Service is fast and the food terrific. A decent amount of selection on the sushi rolls but the only criticism I have is that the printed menu doesn't quite match up with the paper sushi ordering menu so you have to do a lot of hunting to get descriptions of the food.   The place is very popular- get there early if you want a seat.   The fish is very fresh and I was impressed by the quality of the food. Our new north side favorite place."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We had very prompt and polite service. Had the baked lobster roll, which was very good.  It's a quiet atmosphere, good to bring the wife!"}
{"text":"I am a picky sushi fanatic- this place is the real deal - you will never know it from the outside but once you enter the rising sun will greet you with amazing Sushi"}
{"text":"Are those chopsticks in your pocket or are you just happy to sashimi?  Nabeyaki Udon! What a treat!  Any place that can offer me a raw egg yolk is a winner in my eyes.  There were a lot of flavors and texture in this bowl.  My tempura shrimp actually ended up submerged in the broth and got soggy so that wasn't as fun.  I'll be sure to ask for it on the side next time.  I love enoki mushrooms in my hot pot so it was definitely loved in my bowl of udon.  The broth was on the salter side for my taste but it wasn't to the point where I couldn't enjoy my meal.  The udon itself was just okay. I had just gotten back in town from a place that makes their udon fresh and in-house though so it was gonna be hard to please the taste buds after that!  This place makes a solid bowl of noodles and what a great Happy Hour menu offering.  The rolls I did try were pretty tasty.  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  All my friends seemed to enjoy their dinner as well so I'd say this place was great!  I'm glad I saw Kazi H.'s review!"}
{"text":"Went there last night ordered sushi best sushi in town specially the Las Vegas roll would definitely recommend friends"}
{"text":"What a great sushi place in Glendale!  This will now be on my top five list for sushi.  Great choices of sushi rolls on the menu and a great place to hang out with friends or a date.  Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place, it looks like they opened the restaurant some more so there is more space. Nice atmosphere, its around the corner from me so Im sure I will stop in again."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and delicious sushi! Sashimi was super fresh! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here; I bought my son for his first sushi experience. Although it's located in a shopping center, the decor is nice, Japanese themed of course.  For both my visits here I ordered off of the sushi menu; various rolls and negiri, and on each occasion the fish was very good. The service has always been prompt and friendly as well.   They regularly post sake-bomber specials, and although I haven't partaken in such (at this establishment at least) it appears they gladly cater to the boozy crowd. So if you're looking for some Kanpai camaraderie this is likely your place post dinner hours. If you're looking to bring some young ones (no, not Mike, Rick, Vyvyan or Neil - I mean your children) the lunch hour would likely be best."}
{"text":"Great experience, got seated right away.. sat at the sushi bar watched how they made my sushi. Delicious. Go for crazy boy roll and the calamari crunch roll great rolls. My boyfriend and I will for-sure be returning for more !"}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and their Philadelphia Roll was bomb!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a while. It's always one of my favorite go to sushi places. Always fresh and clean with amazing food! Love them!!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi at great prices.  Korean owned...and the only reason I mention this is not to take away from the quality, but to point out that it tends to be at Korean places that you get the biggest bang for your buck. (Think about it...AYCE Korean BBQ, free ban-chan that comes out with every meal at Korean restaurants, etc). At Yen, you get Japanese quality sushi at affordable prices, with no compromise in taste or experience. That's the perfect combo for a sushi joint in my book.   Got the Small Sashimi Platter...25 pieces for $27!  They were good size sashimi slices too, and it included 5 pieces of each of the following: tuna, albacore, salmon, yellowtail, and octopus. Especially with sashimi, you can tell if the quality is good right away with fish like salmon and yellowtail bc they can be easily fishy; however, even with no sauces or rice to hide behind, all the sashimi was super fresh here.  Also ordered the Baked Lobster Roll (bc clearly my eyes were bigger than my stomach). It was tasty, with lots of lobster pieces on top...slightly too sweet for me bc of the sauce that was used, but still yummy.   Would definitely come back if I ever find myself in AZ again."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I DON'T LIKE SUSHI.  My wife does and we have been to a few different sushi places over the years.  Every time I try a few pieces of what she gets and it has VERY rarely been even good.    Yesterday, however, we went to Yen Sushi & Sake Bar.  This place is fan-freaking-tastic.  We went during Happy hour and the prices were great.  I got a hot sake and a large beer.  We ordered a few rolls; a tempurad california roll, tempurad spicey tuna roll and a shrimp roll.  They were all perfect.  They are exactly what sushi should taste like.  The spicey tuna roll was simply perfect.  It had a sweet eel sauce on it that complemented the roll perfectly.    I would highly recommend if you go anywhere else for sushi you at least give this place a shot, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Biggest Dragon roll I've ever seen. I LOVE their soft crab shell roll though. We came for happy hour but literally every roll but one was deep fried.  Service was friendly but she never really asked if we needed anything else after dropping off our food. (For instance I like sriracha) never got the chance to ask for some because she was already headed the other direction. I'm a server and I'm huge on pre bussing.  Our dirty plates were left on our table the entire time. It's not a bad place but we probably won't be returning back."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is amazing. Their staff is pretty friendly and helpful. The last time I was in we had a huge group and they did a pretty good job of taking care of us. It's no easy feat when we didn't stop talking almost the entire time."}
{"text":"Very good.  This place is really good.  Why?  The owners are the sushi chefs.  They buy high quality ingredients.  How do I know?  I worked for the company that supplies them a few things they cook up and they do not mind paying for quality.  The owner is notorious for his belief that good ingredients are expensive for a reason.    A lot of sushi places buy precut and plastic packaged salmon, tuna, and other fish.  The owner/sushi chef buys whole fresh fish and filets them himself.  The beef they use here is very good also.  Certified Angus Beef, in fact.  They don't even advertise that fact.  They let the quality speak for themselves.  Everything is good but my favorite thing to have here is the cold soba/buckwheat noodles.  If you haven't had them before, make sure you try it here.  They will blow you away.  I think one time I've had two orders of it.  I just make sure to order it whenever I go.    When the owner has a passion for the food he serves, it's gotta be good.  I live an hour away from this place and I make it one of my top choices to go for good sushi and japanese cuisine.    Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the food. My favorite is the crazy boy. I only give a 4 star because it takes forever for the food to come out. Other than that. one of my favs."}
{"text":"I am crazy impressed by the quality and freshness here. We enjoyed everything we ordered and had a large variety of sushi. The chopped wasabi is amazing with any sashimi particularly the yellowtail. Friendly service. The sushi chefs were excellent. Probably the best sushi restaurant I've been to Arizona and I've been to many."}
{"text":"Loyal Yen customer since 2011 back when it was a tiny 5x5 room haha. I met my husband here! Best sushi and food. I wish it wasn't so far out there but it's worth the drive! The service is hit or miss...  Some servers are rude and make you feel like you're wasting their time. Once we showed up at 7:30pm to drink while we waited for happy hour and the lady said there are other customers actually ordering food that she would rather wait on. She made sure not to come back until 8. Never asked if we needed anything. The food keeps bringing us back though."}
