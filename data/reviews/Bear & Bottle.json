{"text":"Bear & Bottle is a great addition to the East Madison/Maple Bluff area. The decor is very hip - kind of a woodsy industrial vibe with some nice outdoor seating options. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Great cocktails and solid beer selection. Their salads and tacos are quite good - have yet to try the sandwich options. Tonight we also had the whitefish gazpacho, which was a grilled fish with a generous portion of a fresh chunky tomato salsa. Not what we expected but it was delicious. Give this place a try - they are still new and likely refining, but don't deserve some of the lower ratings folks have given."}
{"text":"Like all the old barnwood. Very open and loud! Had the crab rangoon nachos they were a bit cool in the center. The slaw was good. The pork belly banh mi was very good on a crusty roll."}
{"text":"Went here after reading a review in the paper.  Okay food -- nothing really stood out for us (from the service to the food).  Not bad, but not stand-out, either."}
{"text":"Great summer spot. Food was fabulous and service was excellent. Nice to be able to taste the beers before you order. A little loud, but not unexpected on a beautiful summer Saturday night. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They put a lot of love and creativity into the food, and have a friendly staff. So happy to have a place like this on the Eastside of Madison. Its going to be one of my favorite places for sure! Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent beer menu.  Staff was friendly and helpful even on a busy Friday night. My husband and I both had salads which were delicious.  We also ordered the jalapeño poppers which I highly recommend - not deep fried just charbroiled with cheese. Yum! Ambience was great. I'm excited about this new restaurant and location."}
{"text":"I'm liking this place. It's busy, noisy, lots of kids, fresh air with the overhead doors open. The place was full on Thursday night by 5:30. Food very good, service excellent, a beer list that goes the extra mile. Just what the north side needed -- we'll definitely be back. I wish them well."}
{"text":"Try the pork belly sandwich. Lightly spicy and quite tasty.  Good service...prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I discovered it about a week and a half ago and I've been twice so far; and I haven't had a bad experience yet. They have a plenty of tap beers and their Moscow mules are to die for. Their food is phenomenal. I highly recommend the smoked chicken burrito; it is the best burrito I've had in my life. I'm definitely looking forward to trying everything on their menu. I also loved how their jalapeño poppers weren't fried  my boyfriend and I eat out at least 5 times a week, so we've tried a lot of restaurants; this is DEFINITELY my favorite restaurant, so good."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet then you need to make a point to come in and try this place.  Great food, awesome service & a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good food. I loved the tuna appertizer. I am happy to see modern appertizers on the menu. Bloody mary was delicious. Staff was very nice. One of the owners stopped by to check on us. Nice atmosphere and pictures look great with the burnt wood."}
{"text":"Went to Bear & Bottle last night with our family and it was an OK experience.  The interior of the building was very nice, a little loud, but clean and welcoming.  Ordered the Crab Ragoon Nachos at $13 and expected a little more than what we received.  Very little filling within the pastry, but plenty of cabbage and carrots.  It was definitely different and worth trying, but not a $13 appetizer.  Three of us ordered different tacos (Chicken Verde, Carnitas, and Tilapia) with the thought of sharing between us.  While the fillings were very good and tasty, the shells were soaked in grease and thus did not hold up.  We did ask for additional shells to double them up and prevent the leakage all over us and the staff was quick to provide, but the initial reaction was not a positive one on the quality of the taco.  Other person in our group had the California Chicken sandwich with fries which he said was good.  Service was good with some lapses in getting our server back to the table to order another drink.  Took a short time to get our app, but a long time (30 minutes) between the app and our main course.  

Will try it again as the flavors seemed to be there, but they need to fix a few things to get a regular customer."}
{"text":"Stopped first time for lunch , Tuesday after 12:30pm. Seated right away by host. Completely ignored after this .Waited patiently all other tables seemed to be served well. Finally flagged down a server and asked who had our table she did not know , offered to help us. Also stated we could eat somewhere else. Asked if manger there she said she would get them .  Gave up walked out 3-4 staff hanging out by door, apparently one the manger."}
{"text":"Bear & Bottle is our new favorite neighborhood hangout! The street corn and the crab rangoon nachos are amazing. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the chicken nachos...but will give the food another try since they just opened."}
{"text":"So my wife and I take a walk and end up at Bear and Bottle!  Server was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I want a beer,hmm, 21 California beers and 7 local!  Are you kidding me?  Must be a joke! Nope! What an insult to Wisconsin's brewers!  Now to the food.  My wife had the quinoa salad, 3 out of 5. I had the orange chicken 3 out of 5 again. Atmosphere is fine if you're ok with noise. Lots of hard surfaces, I know, very hip, well very loud too!  They have no competition close, hope they tweak things and are a roaring success.  They are close to the end of the honeymoon period!  We'll see!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here tonight. I'm really excited this place is close by. Atmosphere was great - staff were friendly and food/drinks were top notch. Enjoyed their take on an old fashioned, sliders were solid, wonton nachos were amazing.... looking forward to heading back soon."}
{"text":"The northside really needs a restaurant like the Bear & Bottle. The design of the restaurant with its roll up walls,  and outdoor seating is trendy. The menu is good, and the staff friendly.
After two visits I am disappointed with this place. The bar must be sixty feet long, but after I ordered a Mojito, our waitress came back and said \"sorry, we cant make that drink for you\". Really? They can't make my favorite summer drink.
On my next trip I ordered a basic burger, and it was inedible. The restaurant did take half off the price of the burger. I ended up going to Manna next door, for a muffin to take home because I was still hungry.
Don't get me wrong, I want this place to succeed, but if they can't mix a simple drink or a basic burger, then there are problems brewing.
I think that the owners need to take a step back and review their goals for this concept."}
{"text":"Hate to be another person chiming in with \"I really wanted to love this place, but....\" However, there's just no other way to categorize Bear & Bottle right now. Aesthetically and conceptually, it's pretty perfect. Breezy and gorgeous inside, with a beautiful patio and expansive bar. Lots of big tvs playing various sporting events in the bar- we barely noticed from our table in the dining room. 

Unfortunately, though the menu sounds amazing, the food didn't live up to its description. We started with cheese curds, which were decent. But then I got the \"Smoked Grilled Shrimp\" tacos and my boyfriend got the house burger. My shrimp tacos weren't horrible, but they definitely weren't what I expected. First of all, as others have mentioned, the tortillas didn't hold together so I ate them with a fork. Not a big deal, but then I noticed other issues. The menu said pineapple pico- the shrimp sat atop what seemed to be pineapple ground into a grainy paste with maybe ginger? The menu also said smoked and grilled, neither of which the shrimp seemed to be. The tacos were also missing the bacon lardons from the menu description.  I mentioned this to my boyfriend, who admitted he was disappointed with his burger, which was overcooked and didn't include the \"onion strings\" from the menu.

We did not have the opportunity to let our server know; even though the restaurant only had a handful of other tables (and at least 3 other servers) we sat for quite a while before even getting menus and she was nowhere to be found when we wanted to ask about the omissions from our order... or get more water...or order another round of drinks. By the time she did come back, we were both finished with our food. (she was friendly/personable, but just inattentive) In the meantime, despite the gorgeous night outside and the full patio, several servers rolled the garage style windows down just behind us, which was weirdly unwelcoming. Also odd was the host- when we came in and walked up to what was clearly a host stand around 9 PM (not late for a Saturday), she sighed and looked at us in an annoyed manner and said \"what can I do for you?\" Suggestion: as a host, just assume we're coming in to get a table! 

I thought the wine and beer lists were both impressive, and the food *sounds* so good! Hopefully they work out the kinks in the kitchen/on the floor.... til then I'll stick to sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I've rarely been treated to such derelict, rushed, and inconsiderate service at any other restaurant. From the moment we walked in the door, it was clear my date and I were an inconvenience, intolerably near closing time. If we had worn scarlet letters on our chests, we wouldn't have felt more unwelcome in colonial New England.

The server and hostesses communicated their disdain for our late arrival with rude glances, prompting requests, and ultimately pulled the signed bill from beneath my elbow in the middle of a conversation under the cover of the din from the still-crowded bar. I almost asked if someone would be willing to front the cab fare home, so eager was the staff at this establishment to see us gone. 

We ordered two cocktails and two main dishes less than 5 minutes after being seated. The drinks were average, the pork tasty and the chicken nachos were quite good. But we felt like we were stabbing innocent children with our utensils the entire 50 minutes we spent inside the building. 

Neither of us will be back."}
{"text":"Pros
+ Cool ambiance and decor, a modern yet rustic atmosphere that is large, spacious, and includes an outdoor patio!
+ Our server was a nice dude. 
+ My Paloma cocktail was reasonably priced and easy to drink.
+ There were options to sub out taco shells for lettuce or meat for a vegan option.

Cons
- Our tempura asparagus ends were fibrous and hard to chew. Batter was kind of heavy, more of like a beer batter than a tempura.
- Had al pastor tacos and I wish the pork had seasoning. It needed more spice, some kind of kick, and less pineapple and crema. Tortillas also would fall apart mid-bite.

I wish we could mix and match tacos a la carte. While I liked the drinks, service, and atmosphere, the food left more to be desired. We were glad we tried it but maybe we will just stick to drinks next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Bear and Bottle the Friday after they opened. It was a lovely day, we we wanted to space with a nice indoor/outdoor feel. The space is beautiful, but there are plenty of kinks that need to be worked out. 
1. They sat us at a large family style table. We were the only two people sitting at it, but the places us at the end that is about six inches from the ordering registers. Throughout our entire meal, I was being bumped into by wait staff inputting orders. Staff also used the narrow space to walk to the patio (instead of using the designated door). It made it hard for us to enjoy our meal. 
2. The food was very greasy. I ordered the salmon sandwich, and when I bit into it, oil went everywhere. The fries didn't appear to be shaken in the basket prior to delivery. They were almost inedible. My husband had the same issue with his chickpea sandwich. 
3. They changed wait staff in the middle of our meal. No one communicated that with us, it just happened. When I was out of water, I was unsure who to call on. 
I'm uncertain if we'll be back for a meal, but I may come to enjoy a beer on their patio."}
{"text":"Left Coast. Mendota Coast. Decisively defining this gastropub with two unique blends.  Service has always been great, their specials are written out on butcher paper and are always rotating.  Owners are there getting their hands dirty alongside their fantastic staff.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We had a hard time choosing what to order. Ended up getting the crab Rangoon nachos and a banh mi sandwich. Absolutely wonderful. We'll be back to try more for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for a late lunch. Got greeted and seated at a high table. Very nice and clean atmosphere, rustic feel. Their menu is one page, offer a nice mix of food fusion. Ordered the smoked wings to start and it was good. They had a side of blue cheese I think but I'm not a fan of blue cheese besides that the wings was average tossed in buffalo sauce. Got my Banh Mi with tossed greens which was good. The wife liked the tossed greens. My sandwich was nice and thick, the pork was a little dry but with the sauce and cucumber it made up for it. The wife got the spice pork torta which was big and looked good. The only thing about it was that the pulled pork was dry, if they had some kind of sauce added or something to dip into it'll be good. Over all it's a nice place on the north side."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this spot on a whim and we are so glad we did! We came on a Sunday afternoon and grabbed a couple of seats at the almost empty bar. I love the atmosphere here.. it's cozy, clean and inviting. They have a good draft list as well as cocktails on tap. They encourage you to sample anything on tap before ordering, which is really nice. A couple near us had the nachos and raved about them, so we had to order them. You can get a half order, which I would recommend for 2 people. We enjoyed them and had more than enough for both of us. We also shared the Korean pork tacos which were delicious. The flavors were yummy and they come served in lettuce \"shells\" which I really liked. It added a fresh crunch and nice texture to the dish. We were plenty full from just a half order of nachos and the one order of tacos... so we stopped there. I'm excited to return another time to sample more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fusion restaurants.  It always seems to me like it's an identity crisis for the restaurant and they start out with good intentions, and veer off to the mediocre.  We tried Bear & Bottle last year, and while it was OK it didn't make me stay away. 

We visited last night, and this visit pretty much said meh.  The problem with menus that offer the same meat that takes a long cooking time, you must keep the cooking spices pretty bland.  I mean you have to use the same meat for a Japanese dish, Mexican dish and American dish.  You can't be too specific.  

I didn't care for the menu, it just seemed too...too trendy.   Like if I were one of those hipsters who goes out with a party of friends, and the conversation is more important than what you're eating. It's sounds cool to say I'll have the \"Pork Belly Bahn Mi,\" or \"oh yea it was great, I had soy glazed pork belly.\" 

I settled on an appetizer, the sliders with a side of fries.  My wife had the spicy pork torta.  I wasn't happy.  The meat on the slider was bland, dry and not quite heated up.  Warmish.  Some more time in the microwave might have helped.  The caramelized onions were cold, and the only flavor was delivered by little bit of blue cheese.  It was incredibly boring.  

My wife had the spicy pork torta sandwich.  I tried some of the meat off of her sandwich, and it was the same pork used on my sliders.  I was pretty cranky, because I was hungry and I pretty much had to force myself to eat one slider, I started on the second but I just couldn't finish it.  I didn't want anything else on the menu because I didn't care for anything else.  I was cranky because of the $9.00 we paid for the sliders, and I could have gotten a better product at Perkins.  Or for the same kind of flavor that this slider had, I could have had a little hamburger at McDonald's for a quarter of the price.   Cranky.  
Friends of ours seem to like this place, and will I be back?  Sure, but I'll be sure to eat somewhere else first.  Or maybe I'll try and steer them someplace else.  In the end, I'll say this won't be my first choice to eat, nor a second choice.  There are too many places in the neighborhood that deliver without the pretentiousness of this place"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a good meal with good service both times. While it's been too chilly to eat on the large patio or have the garage-style doors open while I was there, they are really nice touches on a cool-looking place. 

My first stop I had the chicken nachos which, like many menu items, contain pickled jalapeños. I like jalapeños, but quickly discovered that pickled jalapeños are a whole different beast in terms of spicy level, and there were copious amounts in the nachos. So beware while going over the menu. Otherwise the nachos (jalapeños removed) were tasty. They could have benefited from more fresh ingredients, like some chopped tomatoes or shredded lettuce.  We got a brownie dessert which tasted great, but had a hair or fiber baked into it. It was removed from our bill. That time I also had a cocktail, a Coco Limeade, and it was fabulous. 

The second time I went I got the chicken tacos without pickled jalapeños, and they were the best tacos I've ever had, hands down. The ingredients were of high quality and the flavors melded so deliciously. I was thoroughly impressed. My companion was enamored with the house vinaigrette that came on her salad. 

I was put off by my first visit, like anyone would be by a hair or fiber in their food, and I only went back because I already had a  lunch meeting scheduled there. I'm glad I had to go back and I'll definitely return to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Went out to eat on a Friday around 7, had to wait about 15 mins instead of the 30 mins we were told. I figured there would be a wait with it being new and it being a Friday, who can complain about a shorter wait time. While we were waiting we sat at the bar, the gentlemen next to us seemed to be over served.  One of the men stumbled into a table walking and the other rudely reached across my body to grab a drink menu only after to ask if we needed it. The cocktails were also below par, I got a Kentucky mule and my friend got a Moscow Mule. Maybe it was the ginger beer but it wasn't good. 

Things got better when we were sat. Neal was our waiter and did a great job at attending to our table and giving some food recommendations. I didn't plan on getting fish but Neal talked me into the walleye and I'm happy he did. Our food was excellent, the shrimp tacos also looked amazing (good sized shrimp). We ordered off the cocktail list this time hoping for a better result. I ordered the spicy margarita I believe which sounded amazing but did not taste amazing. 

So overall food is great here and so is the service but when it comes to the bar, maybe stick to getting a beer."}
{"text":"This is another place where I wish I could give the service and food 2 different ratings.
The service here was fantastic - 5 stars. Our server was attentive, and made great recommendations. My table was very needy, and he did not seem to mind at all, and really seemed to enjoy his job. A++ for effort. The ambiance was fun. This is definitely a hipster-y place with succulents in the tables and Edison bulbs.
The food...was worse than mediocre, and we ordered quite a few items. I'm about to kind of rip them apart, and I'm sorry for that. 
Street corn - DELISH! So amazing. Possibly the only good dish we ate. 
Crab Rangoon Nachos - These were interesting. I'm not sure I found any crab, and there was little Rangoon. It was mostly slaw. The chili sauce tasted like any other sauce you buy at a store. We basically ate slaw with chili sauce. 
Smoked Pork Quesadilla - This could have been good. The pork was nice, but a little bland. The problem with this was nothing was mixed together, so with each bite you got a different component of the quesadilla, instead of having bites with all the good stuff. So the first few bites were torilla and cheese. The next were tortilla and pork. The last were tortilla and veggies. If they were mixed together it probably would have been good, even if the pork lacked flavor. 
Smoked Chicken Wings - These were like regular wings. Again, the sauce tasted generic like it came from a bottle. They were chewy too, so I'm guessing they should have been cooked longer which was kind of scary. The \"scallion crema\" sauce was just plain yogurt. 
Clam Chowder - Very thin, and not chowder-like at all. Again, bland. 
Spicy Korean Pork Tacos - I like the idea that they are served in lettuce. The execution needs work though. They don't use 1 large piece of lettuce for each taco, but multiple small pieces, making them even messier than they already are. The pork used here was the same pork from the quesadilla, and still bland. It seems like they make a huge batch of pork and use it in everything. The kimchi was hard to eat. Literally. It was in HUGE pieces, and impossible to bite through (or even cut through). No bueno. 
Pork Belly Bahn Mi - The baguette was nice and crunchy. The texture was great, and I love the spicy mayo. No one at my table actually had any pork in their piece, though. It was all fat. I'm aware that pork belly is very fatty...but usually there is a little hunk of meat in there. Not in our piece! I couldn't even eat it. I 
After all of that disappointment, we decided not to get dessert. Basically, it was all extremely disappointing. And some of it was just downright gross. Bear & Bottle is on my list of places not to go back to."}
{"text":"Food is a C+ the drinks are an A-, the location is walking distance to my house, so I love that. Decor and ambiance is an A+. B&B folks (if you're reading), add a couple comfort food items to the menu and I'm a fan for life. Keep it simple."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect after reading some other reviews. But I was so impressed I felt compelled to leave a review for B+B. 

That atmosphere was fantastic, definitely one of the coolest places in Madison. We had great weather so the garage doors were open. The dark wood interior and retro light bulbs work. Seems trendy but not too try hard if that makes sense (unlike some other places in town...). 

Our server was attentive, funny, and offered some recommendations. They had a great beer selection. Was impressed they had Ballast Point's octoberfest on tap along with some breweries I've never tried before. 

The crab rangoon nachos were unique and tasty. Barbacoa tacos were very good. As was the spicy pork torta. 

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Like a lot of other reviewers mentioned, this space is absolutely gorgeous. The best use of the nearly ubiquitous garage doors that are on every new bar and restaurant in town. I had the pork belly bahn mì and although it was a little short on acid and heat, the baguette was perfection and the pork belly was delicious. My friend had a burger and raved about the bun and said it was perfectly cooked. The one and only downfall was that it was extremely loud! The SW corner of the building has a 2 story ceiling with windows so it almost has a atrium feel but the conversations sound cacaphonous in that area and really throughout the whole place. It is owned by the same folks who own Waypoint Public House and others and it has a very similar rustic meets industrial feel altho B&B brings in a little greenery throughout as a nod to it's California inspiration. Great menu lots of choices and plenty of gluten free options food as well as beverage-wise."}
{"text":"Margarita was great and did not need extra shot. Cheese curds are bomb. Pork belly sandwich will not be choice in future-too fatty tasting. Fries ok. Waitress should be more knowledgeable about menu and availability of products restaurant offers. I see them being really great with some tweaking in future. Atmosphere is so great, I want this place to be new go to :)"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese, pork sliders, and ceasar salad are to die for! The beer selection is fun and changes often. I am visiting from out of state, but will be sure to be back another time. The only thing was that they seem to be working on perfecting service and such. The host who sat us was not friendly, but our waitress was sweet and efficient. Hopefully they continue to work out the small kinks, but our experience was great overall!"}
{"text":"Service is decent. I've had a few things off the menu and haven't been entirely impressed by any of it. Everything has a unified flavor throughout the dish. They need to focus on really bringing individual flavors to a next level of deliciousness as opposed to just making it taste familiar. The corn chowder is delicious but there were a lot of husk pieces in it. I think over all a bit more attention to detail throughout the menu would do some good. I  want to look forward to coming back since it has such a potential for a great new local spot, but the food isn't what is pulling me there. The fact that there is a bar and the decor is so inviting are the main reasons I go back."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 different tacos and shared. The Korean taco was excellent and spicy. The barbacoa was also really good. The carnitas was fine but didn't measure up to the other two. 

Great beer list. I'm a big fan of these restaurants by the same owners (Flying Hound, Waypoint, etc). Good addition."}
{"text":"Food was sub par. I think we ordered the wrong things. Wings were amazing. Street corn came out room temp. Service was extremely slow and sat without drinks for way too long. Being a server I am understanding but holy lord of god it was so ridiculous we sat with our food and empty drinks for 15-30 mins(I was so frustrated with seeing our server and him Not even giving a glance or acknowledging us) without getting checked on or asking if we need anything. People think serving is easy and the service is everything!! If I go back I will sit at the bar because it really is a beautiful location but extremely disappointed in the service"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very nice looking, but the bar couldn't make a decent mojito, despite having all of the ingredients ready at the rail. Had to ask for a handful of limes and juice them myself to make it drinkable. 3/5 simply because they just opened, so let's hope experience changes things. Didn't eat the food, so I can't review it. I'll give them a second chance, because the menu looks great."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed.  Took a party there thinking I was so happy to have a classy place in my neighborhood. How disappointing. The service was awful (Trevor) he never came around to see if we needed anything, we had to grab the host or other waitstaff. Then the chicken was tough, the shrimp was burned on one side, etc. don't go until they change it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I got the orange chicken salad and it was better than expected. My husband got the spicy pork torta and he thought it was great. Decor is beautiful. Beer list is good. Our server was AMAZING. Insanely helpful without being annoying."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in to sit at the bar and order a beer. No one acknowledged us, but some bartenders kept looking at us. Finally one stops by and drops off menus. Then he doesn't come back. I see him hanging out at the other end of the bar. No one else notices that we don't have drinks. Finally the bartender that gave us menus comes back and asks us if we've been helped, which was weird because he gave us menus so I assumed he was going to help us. 

We finally get out beers.

Awhile later another bartender checks on us to see if we wanted to order any food. 

Then we finish our drinks. And we wait. And wait. And wait. 

Meanwhile a new bartender shows up. She slowly moves around the bar. Stares at customers. Looks annoyed that she's there. 

I haven't seen our bartender in 10 minutes. I have no idea where he is. 

Finally, a completely different person asks us if we would like another drink. We say no and that we are finished. He says ok and takes our glasses. So we think someone will be getting us the check. Nope. 

And we wait. 

I come to the realization that we could get up and leave and no one would know the difference. But I want to pay for what I purchased. 

I flag down the annoyed bartender, originally thinking she may be a manager. She was not. I start explaining the situation. I get a blank look. No apology. I continue explaining the situation. No apology. She goes off to find our bartender. He never rang in our drinks. 

He finally come back and drops the check. No apology. 

No tip. 

I have no interest in returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the idea, patio is nice and the beer/drinks are excellent but they are missing an important part of Cali cuisine: fresh flavorful veggies.  Everything I have had is a bit bland and generic.  Not terrible but a missed opportunity."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to the Bear and Bottle. We went for the staples-burger and chicken tenders.  First off, I started with the butternut squash soup which was piping hot, The food tasty and delicious-but not too heavy. The food arrived in a very timely fashion. I had 3 large chicken tenders which were crispy in a medium batter. The chicken itself was tender and flavorful. I had a choice of dipping sauces which was nice. The husband had the cheeseburger. It arrived perfectly cooked as requested with pickles, onions, lettuce tomato and lots of cheese. The bun was also delicious. If you are a fry lover, this is the place for you.Both orders came with copious amounts of hand cut delicious fries. Everything, including the service, price and atmosphere was just right on our lunch visit. I think we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a find - tons of great tap brews And a very good wine selection Then a great menu and casual vibe. We did the Salmon plate with appetizers-duck confit sliders And smoked pork tostadas 

Service was great even though the place was rocking 

Thanks Ray Ski"}
{"text":"We live on the Northside, and within walking distance, and I am SO HAPPY to have this restaurant nearby. Definitely an upgrade in food and beverage quality while still being a come-as-you-are, neighborhood place.

I've visited several times and always had great service. I recognize many staff members from one visit to the next, so they seem to be doing a good job of retaining staff.

The space is tastefully decorated and I love the garage doors that open to the patio. I honestly don't notice the traffic on Sherman unless it's a loud truck or motorcycle.

Now for the food and drink:
- excellent beer list with \"Mendota Coast\" to satisfy local taste as well as great offerings from other great breweries across the country
- I personally appreciate the local cider, Restoration, when they have it
- great cocktails, including daily special and extensive bar spirits available
- we've enjoyed the food a lot: excellent salads and sandwiches; GREAT nachos; daily soups have been really good and made with creative inspiration 

Really hope they keep the momentum, as we plan to hang out here a lot!"}
{"text":"First, our ears were ringing when we came out because it's loud.  Beer list looked excellent. We tried the signature mixed drinks and they were good.  The food?  Blah!  One ordered the Beef Barbacoa taco.  It was not good.  Stay away from this, as it's pot roast that's been soaking in beef broth, and you get a soggy, tasteless mess.  I guess the cook (this cannot be a chef) must have thought adding pickled jalapeño would do the trick.  Nope.  Barbacoa has flavor - this had none.  Another ordered the fish tacos.  Those were slightly better when we added the pico, but the fish really had zero flavor.    I'm willing to give the place a second try, but some items were bad, a lot lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Not-Yo Burger... keep this on the menu.  Crave worthy.  Sinfully good.  Despite the long list of toppings... nothing gets lost in this complex burger masterpiece."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, very excited.  We were seated quickly, and our server, who happened to be a friend-in-law, came over quickly.  My boyfriend got a K4 Lady Luck on nitro (!!!!!!) and I had their blackberry collins with gin instead of vodka.  The drinks were delicious, and perfect for the hot day we happened to be there on. I was recommended the tacos, as they apparently were amazing, and while the sandwiches were good, they didn't compare, and you can't get many tacos like these in Madison.  I got the salsa verde chicken tacos (I think that's what they were), and they were fantastic!  They were so fresh, and bright, and had the perfect amount of heat to them.  The single corn tortilla on them was a little thin to eat them in a traditional way, but was so good still.  My boyfriend got the house burger, and ate ever single crumb.  Both satisfied to complete fullness, we couldn't order any dessert.  It's a little pricier than anything else in the neighborhood, but the food was so fresh, the interior was beautiful, and the drinks were cold and tasty.  Excited to try it again!"}
{"text":"It's an awesome restaurant and vibe. The pricing is pretty even. Love the concept of a West Coast / Midwest style bar. The ambiance and everything about the inside and out it is awesome. We did get eaten alive by mosquitoes but it happens. My girlfriend and I got drinks and We ordered the Mexican Street corn which is amazing and Tempura Asparagus. Im leaving this one with a solid 4 stars being that it opened in May. But I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"The unique decor and character of Bear & Bottle took me by surprise, as it was done extremely well. Nestled on the near north side, this seemingly quiet area is home to a great new Madison food and drink establishment. I loved the layout which had the bar and dining area divided by a tasteful wall. When we went, the bar was pretty busy and the dining area was not, however we weren't bothered one bit by any noise coming from the bar. The beer selection on tap rotates monthly and they had some good options and they let us taste test. My husband got the tacos, where were great. I got a salad. We shared the sticky wings which were fantastic. This is a great addition to the north side! Well done!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to check out this place for the first time. At this point I believe it's been open for ~3 weeks. Got the crab rangoon salad and a gin & tonic. 

The drink was quite good, had some type of herb in it that was neither too strong nor too bland. Pretty fairly priced ($6) for what I got. 

The crab rangoon salad was pretty good. I haven't had anything like that before so it's hard to judge. Basically 8 or so crab Rangoons with cabbage/green onion/orange sauce on top. The Rangoon filling seemed to be of a higher quality than you typically get at a Chinese restaurant, tasted more like real crab. Only complaint was that there was very little filling in the rangoons themselves. By the shape of them it looked like they had a a fair amount of filling before they were fried but maybe most of it leaked out while they were getting cooked? Only other thing worth mentioning was the price($13). Seemed to be pretty over priced for what you got, especially since most  other restaurant charge $4-6 for 8 rangoon. So really you just end up paying an extra $7 for a bunch of cabbage. 

Over all I liked the place! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, wide variety on the menu. Will  be returning again."}
{"text":"Finally!!!  The Northside has a place like this. She loves it.  Northside punch and Knoche burgers.  Tacos were great, but allow choice of three, and double up the tortillas. WTF? I feel I was jipped here, as others have posted pictures with 2 shells, and they are needed. It was so hard to decide, so much on the menu we want. We will be back again, again, and again..."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  A great looking building with a modern restaurant.  Reminds me of a place you would see in Milwaukee or Chicago.  Garage doors open for easy \"open air\" restaurant.   Nice bar and outside seating.  Great for large groups or small.

The food.  Two of us ate and it was very good.  The mac and cheese was perfect!  It had delicious bacon and slices of jalapeño in it.  It was the perfect amount of spice and of course you could avoid them if it got too spicy for you.  Great flavor and texture.   The california chicken club was just as delicious.  The bread was not too thick and perfectly grilled.  Love that rosemary sourdough bread from Madison Sourdough!  The fries were perfectly cooked and not soggy.  Beer and cocktail list is good.  The Northside punch was refreshing and sweet, but not too sweet you couldn't drink it all.  

Service was friendly and swift.  I can't wait to go back!  

Try it and let's keep the Northside improving!"}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelmed. Sure they have a good list of California tap beers, and a cool interior that can open outside easily, but it just wasn't that great. More hype than real deal. 

We were excited by the menu, so we had lunch burger/sandwich, a couple beers. Unfortunately, we left fairly disappointed and it was a bit pricer than we hoped."}
{"text":"My Friday fish fry (cod) tacos were outstanding. Already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch. Only had food no cocktails. As for the space and interior, I loved it! Super unique to Madison with the wood and the garage doors. The bar looked nice with several well placed tvs. Service was ok, which was expected due to recently opening.

The food lost them the stars in my review. First of the menu is amazing, definitely something for everyone. We started with the cheese curds which were average. I prefer mine to be crunchy where as these had minimal batter and were mainly just cheese. I got the chicken tacos which were good. However they were sopping wet as in they did not strain the pulled chicken at all. This really detracted from the quality of the Taco. My dining partner ordered a chicken sandwich and somehow ended up with a chickpea sandwich. They ended giving him a chicken sandwich as well. They were pretty good.

Clearly the food and service needs to work out a few kinks. However the menu has many interesting offerings, the interior is stunning, there is a nice patio and there are ample cocktails and beers. I will likely be returning!"}
{"text":"Finally a decent bar/restaurant on the East or North side of Madison! It has been slim pickens around here for a long time. The new guys, Bear and Bottle has a lot going for it. For one thing three of the walls are garage type wall with windows, and they were up on the evening we were there. It makes it seem that you are outside even if you are not. There is outside seating as well facing Sherman Avenue. We will see how that works once the mosquitoes come calling. . They have lots of local tap beers here and even some chrome taps that dispensed my \"speciality\" Old Fashion. It was big and tasty but I felt there wasn't much in the way of alcohol in it. Usually one is plenty but I could have had three without much of a buzz here. The food is pleasantly different with a Korean taco and a good brazed short ribs dinner. The staff was well trained and pleasant.  The bad was the noise level even with the doors open. Very loud! We had some other minor glitches but I will wait till they have been open for a while before I mention them. Hope they keep improving and become part of the scene on this side of town."}
{"text":"Ok...  food was very average. Kids wouldn't touch the cheese curds because \"they don't taste like anything.\"  I tried them, and I agree.  Had the carnitas tacos, they were dry and were also very bland. 

The drinks were good and our server was really nice.  We'll come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Been there twice , food is great! Lots of choices and both times I dined there, everyone in my group loved the food.
Nice atmosphere, a bit noisy by the bar, but, heh, it's a bar!
The first time we ate there, the front of the house person seemed stressed and \"short\", not very pleasant. The second time a different person and a totally friendly vibe.
Pretty important, the first person who greets you, sets the pace for the rest of the night.
Would definitely return, a great addition to the northeast side."}
{"text":"I -really- wanted to like this place...so much in fact that I went back three times after bad experiences. And I've been back twice with friends, because we live on Northside. But while the decor and location is great, I'm going to stick with Dexters, Tip Top, Slices and the Villa, all blocks away with better food and lower prices. 

Recent service examples: Twice got the indication staff wanted us to leave, bill came early, and there were plenty of open tables. One night we went thirty minutes without wait service, when we went to find our waitress, she was upset with us in passive aggressive way. Left food on the table or bar each night, instead of asking for a box to take it home. Waited 20 minutes to get a beer at the bar. (Yes, they are often very very busy.

One evening, they brought out bare tortillas drizzled in cheese sauce with a little chicken. Felt bad for the waitress, who was awesome that evening. Se we went to Culvers to eat after spending $72 at Bear and Bottle for one round of drinks and two apps. Unfortunately, the California theme also comes with West Coast prices for food. It was so disappointing to spend $300 combined over two weeks here, and not be able to find a reason to go back. 

Do yourself a solid, go to one of the other nearby local restaurants. Much better beer selections, lower prices, and they get your order right. Read less"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bear and Bottle and it was a great experience. My fiancé and I ordered two beers and nachos. The nachos were amazing and the waitress gave us money off of our bill because the timing of the nachos didn't meet their kitchens standards. We were extremely surprised because we didn't notice a long wait time. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"So I have been here on several different occasions.  What they do, they do amazing.  There is a single tortilla on the taco.  Dislike.  Heavily.  However, the tacos themselves are amazing.  The desserts are amazing.  My favorite thing on the menu?  The short rib sliders on the app menu.  They come with bleu cheese.  To be honest, I am not a fan of bleu cheese but they compliment the amazing sliders.  I can not stop.  Love love love.  

The venue itself it great.  On a nice day the doors open, so you can be inside but benefit from so much fresh air.  Love it."}
{"text":"Bear & Bottle has been a great addition to the Northside scene (not too long ago, I probably wouldn't have used \"Northside\" and \"scene\" together in a sentence but we've got a lot more going on here these days). 

They're California inspired, so the tap list is split between West coast and WI (cleverly titled Mendota Coast) beers. Due to the west coast focus, I see several brews here that I don;t usually see in Madison, which is nice in a city where we are admittedly VERY spoiled when it comes to beer selection.

We've really enjoyed the food, with the smoked chicken nachos (split between two of us) becoming a pretty frequent meal.  

The patio is fantastic. Have no fear that it's pretty close to North Sherman, the traffic noise isn't bad.  Garage doors open much of the restaurant to the outdoors, for an atmosphere that's finally beginning to catch on in Madison establishments.  There's also one the South side of the building, so the bar seats have a nice al fresco feel as well."}
{"text":"We have visited three times for their fish fry, always great. I love their side greens salad. The vinaigrette is tasty and a nice complement to the fried fish. Have a great selection of beers, and creative cocktails. I Don't like overly sweet cocktails, and they've done a great job of modifying the them to suit my tastes. I tend to ask questions about the menu, and the servers have always been knowledgeable about it, which is refreshing."}
{"text":"BIG portions!  Great beer selection.  Amazing cheese curds.  Super nice server and host/hostess.  What drew us to this restaurant was being able to sit outside, and although it was too busy and we would've had to wait over an hour, the seating on the inside was just as if you were outside.  Open air concept!  Great place!"}
{"text":"I may be a little biased because I live near this place and it's just super convenient for me to go here, but it's solid.  It's not the best for food and drinks in Madison, but it really doesn't do anything wrong.  I've never had anything I disliked on the menu, and I like the West Coast selection of craft beers that they offer.  The interior is designed with large garage doors that open to outside seating, which is something that this area needs."}
{"text":"Bear & Bottle is a great addition to Madison's Northside.  We've visited 3-4 times and the food and service have been impeccable each visit.  I've tried the Burger & Fries, Cheese curds, Duck Confit Sliders, Shrimp Tacos and Club Sandwich - all have been delicious.  If you're on the Northside, looking for great food and some fun - stop by Bear & Bottle, I think you'll be glad you did.  Enjoy! we have."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful and trendy. Coming on a weekday around dinner, it's still pretty packed. We got a window table so the lighting was great and we had a nice view of the patio. 

Crab Rangoon Nachos - 3/5. I thought the dish itself was decent. Not enough filling in the rangoon and they were slightly cold and soggy when we got them. Lots of asian coleslaw but not enough sauce. I suggest giving a separate dipping bowl of the sweet and sour sauce.

Smoke Grilled Shrimp Tacos - 3/5. The corn tortilla was falling apart. Not enough salsa or other flavors so the smokiness of the shrimp was overpowering. This also came out cold too and I felt the shrimp was a little over done.

Braided Short Rib - 4/5. My favorite dish we ordered and it actually came out hot! The polenta was nice and creamy. Ribs were soft and flaky with good sauce and I loved the fried onions! Price is a little high but not terrible.

Overall, if all our food was served hot, I would give it 4 stars. They have a good selection of menu items and I think with a couple tweaks this would be a great summer spot!"}
{"text":"Space was great and my beer selection was great. Staff seemed a bit flustered however listening to them talk of how busy their opening weekend was put much of this into perspective. Will definitely be headed back to try the food."}
{"text":"Bear & Bottle hasn't been open long and for me, the jury is still out.  From a design perspective, on a warm day, the space can't be beat.  There are garage door walls that can be opened fully giving it a perfect flow from indoor and outdoor.  The patio is nice with one major complaint.  The patio tables have a round support underneath that prevents a diner from getting close to the table.  Instead, you need to lean in order to reach your plate or sit sideways.  I  can't imagine anyone sat at these before deciding to purchase.  The bar features beers from the west coast as well as local brews and I thought it to be well curated.  They have an diverse menu with appetizers, a solid salad selection, sandwiches and tacos.  The last, tacos, are a head scratcher for me as it doesn't really fit with the rest of their offerings.  We stopped in on a Mother's Day Sunday and were told up front the kitchen was slammed.  Knowing this, we opted for a salad and the pork torta.  The Spring Salad was just ok with lettuce comprising most of the salad.  I don't understand why restaurants shy away from the other vegetables shining through.  It's spring in Wisconsin, take advantage of it.  For my torta, is was also just ok.  I enjoyed the house made telera roll but the sandwich really lacked any real flavor.  Even after adding hot sauce, I found it lacking. 
I don't often get to this part of town but I would definitely consider trying it again in a few months to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of pork belly? You should be! B&B's version will hook you ( not available on Friday Fish Fry night). It is soy-glazed and comes with rice, pickled ginger and kim chee.
Try it, thank me later."}
{"text":"This is a Soft Opening rating. 3 stars. Beautiful space. Great layout of the bar to the left when you enter and seating all around. Garage doors for access outside in the summer. Love the decor. 

Soft Opening dishes I tried tonight were okay. 
Elotes: so yummy. Basically one Cobb split in two. Spicy due to the yum Tajin!
Crab Rangoon Nachos: I imagined these a bit differently. They were crab rangoons topped with picked cabbage, and orange sauce and green onions. I imagined wonton chips covered with a cream cheese sauce, crab, and green onions. The wontons on some of them were not cooked all the way and had way too much crab than cream cheese it over powered the cheese. 
Fish of the Day: Paella with white fish, smoked chicken, bacon, and PEI mussels. This was advertised on the butcher paper and our server told us too, my plate came without bacon and smoked chicken. Missing items. Too many red onions for my liking. However, the white fish and the mussels were delicious! 
Orange Dreamsicle Creme Brulee: the flavors were all there but every bite I took my teeth became really cold. I've had chilled creme brûlée with a hard sugar too, but this was ice ice cold. I wanted this to be a little more on the just regular cold not ice cold side...also, they forgot to give me a spoon so we had to ask for one.

I had a bite of the food truck Hawaiian shrimp and it was delicious. Then steamed rice was dry and could've been a bamboo rice or coconut rice to give it flavor. We talked as a table and agreed the tiny slices of pineapple would be so good if grilled with cinnamon! 

Drink: Tom Collins cocktail was delicious! It was advertised for $7.50 on the menu but came out as $ 10 on the check. 

They will probably figure out the food soon. Service was okay. I probably will try it once more to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"I have only been here when you could only order on the after hours menu... it was great.  I had the tacos and they were divine.  The server took a shot with us and that was pretty cool I guess.  To be honest I never have seen that but it's a bar and I could only assume that's what you do lol haha. I enjoyed it. Great music and such.  The cheese curds were great as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times and really enjoy it. The cheese curds are wonderful. They have a nice, thin crunchy coating and are partnered with fresh made ranch dipping sauce. The crab Rangoon nachos are also very good and a much lighter option. My husband tried the fish tacos and loved them. I had the fried cod dinner and it was wonderful. Too much fish for one person, but very good. I will order again. We also love their drinks on tap!!  The tasting option before you order your drink is very useful as I have taken the chance on beverages that I wouldn't normally and have been pleasantly surprised. I do hope they bring back the pineapple hard cider-that was beyond amazing!  Definitely recommend. The food, service, and ambience are all very good. 
Update 7/12/17: I have continued to eat at the Bear and Bottle and have taken some of my friends. The experience has not been as good as before. My friend ordered the chicken tacos and the chicken was so dry that she couldn't eat it. When we said something to the waitress, the only suggestion was to add sour cream to try to get it down. They would not take it back. On another visit, we had the shrimp bowl on rice. The shrimp was good, but the rice was inedible. When I said something to the waitress she took it back. She said the kitchen told her that I must not be used to the fresh ginger that was in the rice. That is bullsh*t. I have eaten a lot of fresh ginger and that rice did not taste of ginger. The taste was closer to spackle.  Again, no apology and they would not let us send the food back. Also, there was no adjustment to the bill in either case. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the spring/summer menu. The tacos are great! There was definitely a little spice on the roasted mushroom-poblano taco, & the flavors were balanced perfectly. My friend also really liked the fish tacos even though she normally dislikes slaw.
Very busy on the Friday nights and I'm sure it will be more busy when they open the patio. Only reason why it's not 5 stars is that the wait service was a little slow. But like I said it was a  busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Very cute little place! Loved the patio; minus the mosquitoes, but you can't really control that. And very impressed that it only opened in May this year. Definitely recommend checking it out.
Lots of different foods that you won't find everywhere. I recommend the Mexican street corn and the tempura asparagus. I have no spice tolerance so it was a little spicy for my usual liking, but it was so good that I couldn't stop eating it! And vegetarian corn chowder will always be my weakness, pretty different from a usual corn chowder but I liked it! 
Also, very good cocktails. A good mix of options, not terribly strong, and a decent price. 
Can't wait to come back for actual dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"I had drinks and appetizers with friends here on a Wednesday night. The acoustics are not great with the garage doors closed; all that concrete amplifies the sound and makes it hard to hold a conversation. The beer selection included a fair selection of offerings from West Coast breweries as well as Madison favorites. There are gluten-free options (read: ciders) available as well. The appetizers we ordered were the tempura asparagus, cheese curds, and smoked chicken wings. I really enjoyed the cheese curds. The batter was light (similar to a tempura) and they melted in your mouth. The tempura asparagus was also nice; pickled asparagus spears fried in a tempura batter with a scallion crema (to be honest, this dipping sauce was not my favorite because it was like a watery green goddess dressing). The wings were very meaty, dressed in a Korean BBQ sauce, and served with the same scallion crema (aka watery green goddess dressing, not impressed) and cucumbers and carrots. 

The restaurant is family friendly which is great for some people and not great for others. Hopefully when the weather improves and the patio opens up, the inside acoustics will improve."}
{"text":"I've been to B&B a few times since my initial visit and during my most recent visit we ordered the nachos again.  This time they were packed with the tasty toppings and still overflowing with chips.  Not sure if I just had a light batch last time or they're making some improvements, but either way, they were delicious and very filling.  B&B is becoming one of my new faves.  I love when the garage doors are open and the breeze is flowing through and their cocktails are refreshing and pretty inventive.  They also do a Friday fish fry which our bartender was talking up - can't wait to try that as well!"}
{"text":"A very nice place with the decor of \"modern industrial\" without going over-the-top. Appears to be fairly new. Garage doors towards the street that I imagine are open on warm nights/day along the road (traffic noise?). A very open and airy interior but still able to have a nice conversation with your table-mate. 

Very friendly service. A nice selection of beer, wine, and mixed drinks. Focus is on the craft beers from the Madison area and the West Coast. Well-done in that regard.

The food is what keeps my review from being a 4-star. It came quickly, was served hot, was presented and prepared well, but the selection was not quite to our liking. Menu was a mix of starters, salads, entrees, and sandwiches; not a large list but ok. I wouldn't call it \"fusion\" but it's an interesting mix of Asian and American. Some time was spent coming up with these dishes. A fair amount of spice. Maybe I was being picky that night but I had a difficult time finding something I wanted that didn't have a particular ingredient I'm avoiding or don't care for. 

My wife had the BBQ Ribs which she enjoyed (except for the corn) and I had the Pork Belly. Thankfully I had the Sambal sauce on the side as it was super hot (along with the Kimchi). Portion size was decent and actually generous considering the prices (especially her 1/2 rack).

I'm on a select diet now also which doesn't help but I guess we just didn't hit it off here. Not higher than 3 stars now but I think we'll have to come back and give it another chance when in the area."}
{"text":"Living on the north side I was excited to see this new addition on Sherman ave. I drove by and was surprised to see a cool pub with \"garage doors\" open on a beautiful day. 
I ended up taking my son here for lunch. We both got chicken. I the chicken verde tacos and my son the California chicken sandwich, or something like that. 
The restaurant was busy, and loud as others said. Part of that has to do with the acoustics. 
The food took a long time to arrive, I had two delicious beers while I waited. A nice beer selection. 
While the dishes sounded great on the menu, and had some flavors to it. The chicken in my taco was very dry, and the tortilla wasn't steamed very well and fell apart. My son said his sandwich was also dry. 
Neat place. I'll try some other dish next time. But I'll probably just stop here for beer and apps."}
{"text":"Wow! Came here with my boyfriend once and wooh it was so good! We sat outside and our waitress was quick and nice! We had spicy corn as an appetizer and wow it was so good! Spicy and salty! Also had tilapia tacos and they were great too! Not too pricey and has a wide variety of food to choose from and a lot of beer to choose from! If you love corn I recommend getting the corn!"}
{"text":"Walking In the restaurant is gorgeous. I had to walk around and take it all in. It is very well put together and a great addition to the north side

We went to the bar while waiting for a table and we were immediately greeted by a friendly bar staff who informed us of everything they had...including cocktails on tap how fun is that!? Try the punch!

We ordered a bunch of apps. The sever kept checking in on us and apologizing for the wait...we didn't even know we had been waiting and it was opening night...things are expected to take awhile. The apps were great.... I recommend the crab Rangoon nachos or the tempura asparagus!

For dinner I got the short ribs! They were fabulous! My friend had the Hawaiian shrimp and it was spot on! 

And I got to top of dinner with a chocolate chip cookie and a glass of milk!? Yum

Will definitely be returning and am looking forward to the weather being nicer and checking out the patio!"}
{"text":"We had such a great first visit! Everyone in our party of 6 has worked in the restaurant business at some point, so we can totally be critical. That being said... The server was super nice and attentive. The food was all pretty amazing. Great beer selection and very impressed with their cocktails. And they did such a good job with the space! It's  comfortable, airy, and has a lot of seating variety. I can't wait to go back. A great addition to the northside!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service. Had the tilapia tacos. The fish was well cooked and the breading light and crisp. Unfortunately, the rest was quite bland. The \"chimichurri\" definitely does not deserve the name. My family is from Argentina and I love the traditional sauce - this was tasteless green mayo. Very disappointed. The bloody marys also left much to be desired. Very thin and watery, with a smokey aftertaste that I did not enjoy. My friend did not like hers either. Would not order either item again, but there were other dishes on the menu that sounded tasty so I'll probably give them another try."}
{"text":"Love Bear & Bottle! Great craft beer selection from Cali and the Madison area. The cocktail menu looked great. 

The food menu was a good size with a good variety. I went with the Barbacoa beef tacos and they were so good. Decent portion. Hubby had the pork torta with fries. We were both happy. 

The atmosphere was great. Good music. Host was super friendly as was the waitstaff. Our waiter came around a reasonable amount. I absolutely love the garage door walls opened up to let the beautiful weather in.

Will be back for sure! Can't wait to bring some friends and try some of the apps and cocktails. B&B is a great addition to MSN."}
{"text":"We came here to try since it was new and we were a little hungry. They're only a month in but they have proven they should last! The beer list is exclusively from California and Wisconsin and doesn't disappoint. We shared an order of the tilapia tacos, which come with 3 tacos per order. The tilapia was perfectly fried and the toppings were absolutely perfect. 

The space is very fresh and new. It was pretty empty when we were there, but it looks like it would still be a great place when it's full. The staff were very friendly and I'm looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch on a Friday. I ordered a pineapple Rita. It was sweet and spicy. They can do it without the spice but I personally like spices drinks. It was nice and balanced.

For lunch I ordered the smoked chicken tacos. The tacos were nice. They make there own queso in house which is a nice touch. They were good not amazing but solid. 

Overall this was a good lunch place. They have a nice menu and I would like to try some of there other options."}
{"text":"Service? Great. Decor? Super cute even tho it's in a mini mall. Food? I give it 1 star for jalapeño poppers, needed to be roasted longer. Not cooked well.  2 stars for the very disappointing - I wanted SO MUCH for the to be good! - crab Rangoon nachos, there was NOTHING in the Rangoon, just straight fried won tons. 3 stars for the pork quesadillas- delicious and filling! Overall, 2 stars. Fix the other apps and maybe some less sweet cocktails and you'll have a good menu!"}
{"text":"Wow just have to say Spicy  Korean Pork Taco. Served up on bib lettuce. Fantastic open air dining spot with a great beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant on the east side of Madison. The employees were super friendly and the restaurant ambiance was pretty neat. The food, however, was average at best. This restaurant seemed to be best for its drinks.

I ordered the jalapeno mac & cheese which tasted like jalapeno and that's about it. So, if that's what you like then take a chance! We also ordered the crab rangoon nachos. There were about 3 crab rangoons and a large amount of garnish which we did not eat. 

I might try this place again to see if anything changes, but for now it was just ok."}
{"text":"I visited on a couple different occasions but most recently I sat at the outdoor patio and loved it.  The noise from larger trucks going by was occasionally difficult for conversation but I loved being outside more than the noise bothered me.  As usual, there were a number of tough choices in regards to the drink options as well as so many food options that sound good.  Service is attentive and efficient adds to the welcoming atmosphere of the space.   
I've previously bellied up to the bar and enjoyed the knowledge of the bar tender regarding the beers that they have on tap (a California focus) and their various can and bottle options.  I enjoyed the samples that were available for the taps and made good use of the advice regarding the items I couldn't sample.  I will certainly be back to try out more of the beers and enjoy some meals with friends.   A wonderful addition to the Eastside/Northside neighborhood."}
{"text":"Definitely great for groups (with or without kids), sports fans and folks looking for a quick bite. You should check out B&B to enjoy the modern French-country style interior with tons of natural light and numerous flat screens in the bar area. People are friendly and it's a nice addition to Madison's non-downtown scene.

The food (in our case corn chowder, cheese curds and pork belly bahn mi) were fine but won't rock your world. Service was a touch slow and unremarkable (surprising for a weekend lunch). Great wine by the glass, craft beer and bourbon menu."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I've had a more recent meal where the execution of an uninspiring, over priced menu, was so bad. The House Burger, over medium, came out charred, grey and dry. The onion strings were under the patty and in the tomato jam. It was pointless to have them. Cheese slice was paper thin and the bacon had a metallic/off-putting taste. This all on a burger the size of a hockey puck and half the size of the bun. I would have been disappointed if this was $6.50, but at $12.50 it was only good for a laugh.... I am pretty sure I could have gotten better quality fries in a 5lb bag for a $1 at a discount store.  I'll obviously never be back."}
{"text":"To the people that think this place is loud, you must not eat downtown!  We stopped in on a busy Thursday night, and sitting on the bar side, with the walls open, it was loud, but not as bad as those tiny Capital restaurants.  Plus, it's so roomy inside!  It's open air with outdoor seating, and the service was great.   Our waitress knew the menu inside and out, which was great, since the entire menu looked incredible.  We started with the wings, which were a delish (not spicy) twist on an Asian/sweet wing.  I ordered the beer braised short ribs with cheesy grits, while my BF got the torta.  We both agreed that my meal was the best, and although some of my meat was all fat, the flavor was fantastic.  I look forward to heading back, and hope they expand their burger offerings (they were kind of boring)."}
{"text":"We were really impressed by the flavor of the food and portion sizes. Seated in the bar area at a half booth and chairs table. I like these kind of tables. Sit together on the bench side and watch the busy bar area. 

Our waitress was attentive and very nice. We enjoyed the ambience and service. It was perfect. No pressure. 

The beer and cocktail list was phenomenal. Loved seeing all the California beers. Some great stuff there and it was refreshing to see all this on tap. Not that I don't love a good Wisconsin Brew, this was a nice different experience. 

We ordered the Pork Belly Bahn Mi. My wife's favorite of the two sandwiches. The other was the duck confit sliders with hooks blue cheese. Very, very tasty. Then we each split a street corn on the cob. You get two on a stick. Delicious. 

Been finding some great places around Madison lately. This is another one. Thank you for a great experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on our way back to Chicago from the Dells and had a great experience. The staff was attentive and friendly. The food was delicious and there was a decent amount of vegetarian options. The blackberry Collins cocktail hit the spot. The atmosphere/decor was modern and welcoming. If Bear and Bottle was located near my home it would be a regular \"go-to\" spot for us."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for quick lunch before we continued our long drive. This restaurant is not quite pet friendly but you can however tie your pets and have them on the outer side of the patio. Very spacious restaurant with modern transitional decor. They had both indoor and outdoor seating. Ordered the street corn and crab rangoon salad for appetizers and it was so delicious. Had the chicken verde tacos for my entree and that was on point as well. I love this place and will certainly visit if I happen to be in town again."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks and some apps. The ambiance was fun and trendy. The cocktail list had several fun drinks on it. I had the Bear & Bottle Old Fashioned. It was made well and tasted great. 

For appetizers, we tried the jalapeño poppers, crab rangoon nachos, and the smoked pork quesadilla. The jalapeño poppers were not fried, which was really fun and creative. I hadn't seen this before. Unfortunately, I found the peppers to be a little undercooked. They were supposed to be char broiled, but it did not seem like they were. 

The crab rangoon nachos were pretty disappointing. The crab rangoon had absolutely no filling in them. It was basically just 6 fried wontons with some cabbage slaw over it. It was not good at all. 

The pork quesadilla was awesome! The tortilla was cooked perfectly and was slightly crunchy. They loaded it up with the smoked pork, which was delicious. I was surprised at how much meat they actually put in. This was by far the favorite of the 3 apps we had. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere which will be even better in the summer when the overhead doors are open. We also enjoyed the food, although we were hoping for a fresher California feel. The menu is heavy on chicken, pork and bacon and there weren't too many vegetarian options. I was happy to see a few seafood dishes but they often had pork (shrimp tacos are my favorite but they had bacon lardon, so I passed). I finally settled on the Hawaiian truck style shrimp which was delicious, if small for the price ($16.50 for a medium bowl I easily finished). We'll be back, but hope there will be menu rotations occasionally with more vegetarian and seafood options.

Update: We tried Bear and Bottle again and the experience wasn't great. We stopped for a drink after a movie. It was about 9:30 or 10:00, and the host seemed slightly put out that we were coming in. This may be because the entrance is awkward, so the host has to leave the stand to greet you. There are two doors and the front one was partially blocked by carts and signs (but there were still plenty of people inside). The service was slow. We had to order at the bar while the table next to us had a server. I like the space and there are some good qualities, but sadly this place is falling a little flat for us.

Update: I was happy to see a bean burger added to the menu, but sadly it was disappointing. Way too thick and mealy. A bean burger is best when it's a little thinner so the beans retain some firmness and the edges crisp. The flavor was good but the texture was awful. And to add insult to injury, there was a $1.50 upcharge for it! 

I had such high hopes for a California inspired restaurant. I was dreaming of simple fish or shrimp tacos, veggie dishes, limey drinks and fresh guacamole. We'll continue to support Bear and Bottle but will stick to drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday. Very nice interior.  But by the time 5:30 rolled around it was so loud in there I could not hear my dining companion speak and she was seated next to me.  They really need to fix the acoustics.  Cement floors plus high ceiling equals loud.  DO no go there with anyone  who has trouble hearing or you will not enjoy it.  Or eat outside on the patio.  The garage doors are nice, but when the sun sets you may not be able to see, as I was blinded, I had to keep moving my head around to keep the sun directly out of my eyes.  

   Our server was very nice.  Food was ok.  Burger & fries.  They forgot to put the onions on my burger, but when i told them they came quickly.  A deal for $8.50 - fries were good, burger- very average, slightly overcooked.  I have had much better. 

My companion had tacos and they were so greasy/saucy the whole plate was filled with grease.  I mean it just poured out of the taco.   So she had a hard time eating them.  I guess they tasted ok.  

We will go back to try fish fry and only will sit outside.  It is a very nice place and I wish I could rate it higher.   I am sure as time goes by it will get better. Its nice to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had the vegan burger and there was way too much salt in it. This was about 2 months ago. Maybe they've changed the recipe. But at the time I couldn't even eat it because it was so salty."}
{"text":"Nice patio and good atmosphere. Large selection of west coast beers. Cheese curds were a bit too oily/soggy. Food is better than your average bar. Marginally pricy in terms of value."}
{"text":"I think this place gets better and better every time I am in. 

I stopped in last night for dinner with the BF. We really wanted tacos, or at least I did, and he had still never been here, so it worked out! 

We started with a couple cocktails. I had the Bear's Blinker - Bulliet bourbon, grapefruit, hibiscus, and lemon. It was a really interesting flavor and I like it a lot! He had the Old Fashioned and said it was great as well. 

Of course we ordered the Street Corn Appetizer. I'm telling you guys, this stuff is not to be overlooked. SO GOOD. 

I went with the Al Pastor tacos for my main course. These were so yummy!! I do wish there had been more pineapple. Don't get me wrong, there was a generous amount included, I just love pineapple and will always want more :) 

He had the spicy pork torta with fries. The fries! OMG! Some of the best I've had. The torta was also super delicious. The bread was a little dense for my liking, I would have preferred something a little lighter maybe, but overall it was a great sandwich. 

10/10 recommend!"}
