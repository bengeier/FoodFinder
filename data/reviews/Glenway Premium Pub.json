{"text":"First time to pub. Excellent experience!  We were a party of eight which can be challenging.  Service was superb and the food was great."}
{"text":"Gleway Pub is a great place to visit in Belmont NC! They have a very well set up restaurant. I've visited this place a couple of times and the food and service are great. They always have food specials and drink specials. They also have kids free night on Monday, Ladies Night on Tuesdays and Half priced wine on Wednesdays. They have a good variety of beer on tap and also the usual suspects (domestic & imported) 
The food is good, I've had their fried pickles, hamburgers and wings... The wings are nice because they are not \"saucy\", however if you like them hot better go with the hottest one they have because the mild and medium barely have heat (I'm more of a hot wing fan but the flavor was great)
Everyone in my party enjoyed their food and they had a cobb salad, meatloaf and the sliders.
I also had a brownie sunday for dessert to share and it was very good.

They have TV's all over and outdoor seating which is nice. They also have high chairs and a kid menu. My kids loved the food too."}
{"text":"We've gotten wings, salads and sandwhich where a few times. Everything is good. My favorite thing is the Baja fish wrap. Boom boom shrimp are very tasty. Waitress has always been good on soda refills which is mostly what I care most about when dining out."}
{"text":"Tried this spot on a trip through town. The food was really good especially the fried green tomatoes and brisket. A variety of beer to try and enough TVs to catch all your games."}
{"text":"Jackpot!  First time here and I was pleasantly surprised the food is more than typical bar food.  My Orchard Salad was fresh and tasty and the absolute best meatloaf and collard greens I've ever tasted.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is always my go to place if I want to grab a bite to eat or a drink! Everything on the menu is amazing, their beef tenderloin with creamy grits are absolutely out of this world! Theres a great selection of beer as well. Service is always great and we're in and out in a timely manner! They've got outdoor seating as well which is great during the warm weather because the train passes right by! Cant say enough about this place"}
{"text":"I've been going the Glenway Premium. Pub for years! I have nothing but good things to say about it. I have enjoy may meal and fun time at the Glenway. The food and drinks are moderately priced. Although the staff has changed from time to time the service and commitment to consistent quality food and customer service has not changed. The food is prepared daily, served fresh, very tasty and served within a reasonable wait time. Although it can become very pack at time and the waiting time for can lager, the serving crew do there best to meet the customer expectations of a quality served meal. The menu consists of southern and Americana appetizer, the chicken wings are the best with many types to choose from, the burgers are made with the highest quality of beef, the salad are the freshest and tasty as can be. They offer daily special on drinks, beer and food items. The beer bar none is the best in town and elsewhere. The craft beers and premium bourbons selection is top notch. Offering a variety of North Carolina, South Carolina and other eastern regional craft beers and at time when available other highly sought after limited edition craft brews throughout America. The bourbon selection is a fine quality selection of some the finest mid to high end brands available to stimulate any bourbon drinker palet. The waitresses are polite, accommodating, very friendly and above all attentive to the patrons needs. Parking is ample and plenty across the street from the Glenway Premium Pub. All in all the Glenway Premium Pub is a hidden jewel in a laid back charming community of Belmont, NC and well worth a visit for our family, friends and party get to gathers. Give them a try I'm sure you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Staff was terrible. Waitress charged party of 6 gratuity of 20% for drinks. Manager said she was right and then later told us she was fired. She left with her apron. Nothing but scams and lies. She doesn't deserve to be fired (if she was) and thought glenlivet was a dark beer, but the manager needs to learn how to manage. FYI quit counting your tips in the middle of the bar."}
{"text":"This is our Cheers - where all the bartenders know our name.  Local, hometown feel with great (bar) food. They could have more Oberon on tap...but, they're learning.  ;)"}
{"text":"I have been to Glenway many times. It's always busy, as most Belmont establishments. 
Good beer selection for craft beer drinkers. They always introduce new beers to the menu. 
Solid food. I like their fish & chips, fried green tomatoes, tenderloin tips, etc. I wish they introduce some new items to the food menu though as the menu has remained exactly the same since I visited for the first time a year ago and I have grown tired of it. How about doing some daily specials? 
Service can be hit or miss, especially when it's busy."}
{"text":"Do a couple of small plates as a meal to take in as much as you can of this outstanding menu experience.  The fried green tomatoes are great.  Try the red neck egg rolls to experience collard greens like you never have.  This is serious hand made food.  Great to have all the local beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Judging by the number of kids it's family friendly but I wouldn't take small kids. Sliders were perfect, fish taco and shrimp tacos were so good. Extensive beer and wine selection. Definitely a diamond in the ruff."}
{"text":"Great service! Homey spot while traveling,  lots of regulars too! Wings are yummy! Lots of great beer choices too!"}
{"text":"The Red Raiders is THE best pulled pork smoked BBQ  sandwich I've had. So many choices and options for everyone."}
{"text":"Came in for the special tonight --- sesame crusted ahi tuna with avocado wasabi dressing.  Absolutely the best!!  The attention to detail with the cocktail sauce around the rim of the bowl is brilliant and really puts it over the top.  Not to mention that it's wine Wednesday and I got my bottle of wine half price."}
{"text":"Wings with the XXX sauce were amazing. Not too hot, just right. We will go back soon. Server and manager were kind and attentive. Thanks for a quality experience!"}
{"text":"Their patio is my favorite thing in the world especially when it's cold outside. The heaters are intense and awesome for cold weather when you still want to be outside. Plus, they allow dogs on the patio so of course that's a plus! (Food is awesome too)"}
{"text":"Literally love this bar, we're there at least once per week, yet we have received service that has been going down. We always sit on the patio and know the routine and tonight we're told to get up and get off the patio. There is a nice way to ask it but that didn't occur.  Love this place but seriously considering about finding another place to spend my money."}
{"text":"Glenway is worth the drive to Belmont.  Their fried pickles are life changing and their blackened shrimp salad is a National treasure... highly recommended."}
{"text":"Average place. Not much else around so the locals flock to this place and make them rich. Menu is pricey and quantity not that great or at least mine was not, nothing like the pictures below. I didn't feel like this place is \"much\" better than other places who cater to the same type of crowd. Not a place I would go out of my to go to. I didn't have a bad experience but the fanfare this place gets and from the posts below might be misleading to someone looking into going here."}
{"text":"Great variety.  Bourbon chicken sandwich with fries,  tender and delicious.  Chicken salad moist with freshly pulled white meat, the must try is fried green tomatoes with goat cheese.    Large outdoor eating area with excellent service makes this place 5 star in my book"}
{"text":"Super good restaurant, we loved this fish and chips, steakhouse burgers and wings. Great craft beer selection as well"}
{"text":"Dinner and service was amazing !  Finally an awesome place to ride to and get a bite to eat... thanks yall for making date night a hit!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had hiked the Seven Oaks Trail and found Glenway Premium Pub on Yelp. 

We sat at the bar and had a great meal! The big Fish sandwich was soooo good! The cucumber and tomato salad was so fresh! Not to mention a fun atmosphere with so many great beers on tap! It is a great, fun place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sports bar atmosphere here.  Unique southern appetizers were great.  The pork porterhouse meal was spot on.  Most places overlook pork, this was moist perfection cooked medium as ordered.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Hate having to revise a review for the worst but Glenway clearly had it coming. Food quality and appearance WAY down. Portions are small. Service is diminishing. Last 3-4 visits have flat out sucked, but there aren't many choices in Belmont so I've been willing to give them another chance...and another...and no another. Not any more. Perhaps the extremely racist comments I overheard coming from the owner is what put the final nail in this coffin lid. I can tolerate bad food and service, but not from an obvious racist who doesn't even try to hide his disgusting comments."}
{"text":"I frequent all the Belmont places.  I know most of the owners and wait staff and do not mind giving my feedback privately.  We spend a lot and tip well because we love it here and the local businesses.  But I went here tonight and got what felt and sounded like a reprimand from a teenage hostess, followed by telling me no wanted to serve us a drink while we waited for a table to open up outside because there were printer problems and to make it worse the hostess continued to look at us incredulously by my early response and of course we got the cold tasteless fries from someone's afternoons lunch."}
{"text":"Great service.  Our server was awesome.  Very friend and attentive.

Food:  It was pretty good.  The collards were really good; the meatloaf didn't have a really great flavor, but it wasn't bad.  The country fried steak is good.  Mashed potatoes were a bit dry.  Overall it was a good meal and I'd return."}
{"text":"Favorite spot to go in Belmont. Servers are almost always on point (always friendly) and food is always good. Wings are the best around this area, and if you like a good salad get the orchard salad. Great place to hang and the deck is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Indoor atmosphere is typical pub with lots of Tv's with the outdoors having beautiful string lights. Food and service was good. Wished they would have had their signature dishes highlighted as they seemed to have many different categories to choose from."}
{"text":"Delicious food nice size establishment.  The service was great.  Even got an apology from the server when she made a mistake on my order.  I really did like that.  If here I will surely visit this place again."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often. It's our favorite pub to eat at in Belmont. The food is always good. I love to get the appetizer of nachos with grilled chicken as my meal, he loves the meatloaf plate. My favorite salad is the tenderloin salad (cooked medium with ranch dressing).fried green tomatoes are also a favorite for us. The staff/waitress service is hit and miss sometimes. Obviously some are better than others but we haven't had such a bad experience we wouldn't go back. Still a regular spot for us. Also pets are allowed outside on deck if you decide to eat out there. It's great if your dog behaves well (mine most definitely would not :) )"}
{"text":"Tried this place again and like it a lot better. I found a new favorite place for salads. They have a nice selection of good salads. Great service too."}
{"text":"I tried glenways today for the first time with some friends, and it was fantastic! I got the buffalo chicken sandwhich with mashed potatoes and gravy, and OH MY GOSH, the BEST gravy I've ever had, and the sandwich was delicious too! Brooklyn was my server, and she made my experience phenomenal, she was very down to earth and easy to talk to. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I found this little gem trying to find lunch as I was exploring, it was the Yelp race based on having easy parking. 

I walked in and was helped quickly. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pork was nice, it was clearly thrown on the flat top so it has some nice crunch here and there to add some texture. The slaw was just slaw but again the crunch was nice. The sauce was really sweet, and I would have to say it was overly sauced. If I ever ended up back I would get it on the side to help protect the bun from getting soggy. The fries were really good. I'm always a fan of the \"battered\" fries but I know not everyone feels the same way. 

The atmosphere was okay, it was surprisingly loud for lunch. They have a large patio that looked pretty nice and it had a few TVs out there. Lots of TVs inside too."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and something to eat. Half price appetizers before 6pm. Fried Green Tomatoes and the Chicken Fingers were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is lots of fun. The food is really good, as is the service. I really like the sliders here myself. They have a good sports bar atmosphere and show all the games on TV's all around the building. There is an outside patio off to the side. The beer selection is very good, and they rotate selections periodically. They have a full bar and wine available as well."}
{"text":"Exceptional little pub. My wife and I split the fried green tomatoes, which were superb. She had the orchard salad with crab cake (she thoroughly enjoyed it) and I had the \"Belmont burger.\" It  definitely cracked my top 5 all time. The wait staff was timely and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a business trip between Spartanburg and Charlotte. Was actually looking for another restaurant and ended up at this little gem. I had my mind set on burgers and this place knocked it out of the park. Best burger I've ever had, which is hard for me to admit, because I live in Houston, TX. I ordered \"The Belmont\", named after the little town it's in. Worthy of the name! I usually order mine medium rare, but went with medium for whatever reason. It was so hot, so juicy, absolutely fantastically cooked. Perfection. The pimento cheese actually made it the best burger ever. So, so gooey and delicious. Bacon cooked perfectly. I wanted to hug the kitchen staff. Fries were great too!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive for what it is. I got the whiskey chicken sandwich, which could have done without the \"sandwich\" bit if you ask me. I found it was better on its own. Unfortunately, I swapped my side out for fried green tomatoes. That was a bad choice. I received two small, dry, hard, fried, discs that tasted like firm, bland, breading. They didn't even offer a sauce to go with them. Most places I've been pair those with a spicy southwestern ranch or something. It could be better, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"It's no secret that Glenway is one of my favorite places of all time--it's casual, it's consistent, it's delicious, it's downtown Belmont and actually has parking!! Haha. I've never had ANYTHING from Glenway that hasn't been awesome! 

Well, today, some of the other teachers at my school and I ordered out for my birthday. We each had our order and then we each had our own payment sent. The fabulous folks at Glenway had our orders ready on time, the separate receipts all laid out and ready to go, and even helped take the order out to the car. Everyone was more than happy with our food, too! So, next time you're ordering lunch in Belmont, definitely give Glenway a try!! :)"}
{"text":"Found this place while waiting for my dog to be groomed. Nice casual atmosphere. Had the fries pickles and they were really good, slices with a great seasoning. The southwest sliders were good. Portions were more than enough and the waitress was very attentive. Great lunch."}
{"text":"I love Glenway.  It is really the only bar in Belmont where you can watch a game. (multiple tvs) I highly recommend sitting at the bar as you will get superb service from either Stephanie, Erin or Ashley.  They have an awesome draft selection with a lot of NC and Charlotte breweries represented.  Also- the food is great.  You would think a bar with sports would only serve typical fried fare.  But Glenway has an extensive menu with several outstanding options.  All in all, Glenway has TVs, fantastice service and great food.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Excellent wings, chicken club, and chop steak! Our waitress was very pleasant, but, they need more servers here. It's too crowded for only 2-3 people taking orders and running food out.
Overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"This is a local pub in town. They carry a southern style cooking which can be seen with their coating on fish and chip.  This place is always crowed with locals. You can get a good sandwich or wrap for $7.50. I had to come back for dinner on the same day because their fish wrap was that good. 

If you drink beer, try the local Hornet nest or good Juju."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this bar greatly.  The past few times I have gone, it seems I always get the same server who tonight was actually pretty sober and on top of things.  But I have NEVER been charged 25 cents to sample a beer....yes, a little shot glass size sample.  Of course, It's not the cost, it's the principle.  I did say something to the server and she went to the bar, where she proceeded to mock me and be completely disrespectful.  It's so disheartening to go to a place with such great potential, but then u have the little things such as this that make you never want to return.   In the past I've looked past seeing a server so messed up on what appeared to be pills, that she was nearly falling asleep standing up, and looked past the hair in my food, and the broken drink glasses....but the complete disrespect by mocking me has taken it to another level."}
{"text":"This review is based more on lunch times then other times. 

I eat here a lot for lunch and the food if good to great. Never had anything horrible at all. I sit at the bars good bit and the service is excellent. All the staff seems very friendly and attentive to the customers. 

Specials are normally the same through the the week so you can always come back for one if you love it. 

Decent selection on the menu and they can turn most burger and sandwiches into wraps if you ask. 

The beer selection is normally decent with choices from each style of beer. I've always found a nice IPA when I want one. 

A few comments on some of the foods

Chicken wrap is excellent 
Whiskey Chicken is excellent ( better with bun then asking for wrap)
Pot Pie is great
Vegetables are great 
Fried pickles are good to great (according to how much seasoning)
Fried green tomatoes as an Appetizer not my favorite but my buddy gets them every single time he loves them"}
{"text":"So I returned with my husband for the Parmesan Risotto.  I asked to get the Salmon with Black Bean Cake and mixed Veggies with an add on of the Parmesan Risotto but they could not do the Risotto as an additional side because I was told they make it before the dinner shift and they only make enough to go with the sirloin tips.  As disappointed as I was I changed the order to Sirloin Tips with Risotto, but sadly the Risotto did not taste at all the same as the first time I had it.  There wasn't even a hint of Parmesan flavor and the sirloin tips were quite tough and fatty.  I mentioned my disappointment to the waitress and she did apologize and walked away not to the kitchen area to let anyone know my disappointment though.  I am a fan of consistency and fresh food so needless to say I was quite disappointed this visit.  On a better note the hot wings and blue cheese dressing were delicious.  I hope they stay that way.  Stuck with a Corona Light this time their mixed drinks are expensive for a martini sized drink"}
{"text":"The service is amazing, the food is fresh and cooked by an all star staff.  Oh and the bar?  The beer selection is great while ever changing and the mixed drinks are not lacking in value nor taste."}
{"text":"I can't even comment on the food. Used to be great but the last few times we have ordered to-go the kitchen has had no problem sending burnt food out. Not just a little burnt but BURNT. The people at the window that receive the food and close the box ALSO have no problem sending out bad food. When you wait almost an hour and then get home with pricy food that you can't even eat. Not good. It's sad that they look right at it and think it's ok. The boss man needs to get people in there that care about the reputation of the business. Too many other places close by to eat at."}
{"text":"Good food,  have mostly done takeout more than eat in.   Take out was fairly easy and order was right each time.   Tight walking and eating spaces inside."}
{"text":"This past Saturday our wing cravings needed to be met, and we wanted to explore the Belmont area. When we showed up,  it was packed and the hostess seemed frazzled. She told us if they seated us it would be at least 45 mins or longer before we could even place our orders. They didn't explain it was because the kitchen was in the weeds...but they were. I'm not one to be easily swayed away from trying a restaurant so we sat, had a beer, and had the. sweetest. server. She took our order not long into the wait...and I was nervous the food would suck since they had been overwhelmed. NOPE. Omg. The fried pickles and the hot wings (hubs and I both got just the hot wing flavor...we keep it classic.) were fantastic. Those wings definitely tasted like you could find them in my home of Rochester/Buffalo NY area. Very impressive. It wasn't cheap but when are good wings really cheap? Never. We will be back soon! So impressed with how professional and well the kitchen staff and servers bounced back after being slammed. The food did not suffer...and I'd wait  even longer next time for those wings yall."}
{"text":"The redneck eggrolls were really good! Do you get those. The chicken salad sandwich was kind of bland and dry. It needed more ingredients like fruit or nuts. I would not get it again. My husband got the wings and liked them pretty well. Liked the french fries. It was very hot in the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection and great bartenders. One of my favorite pubs in Belmont. The daily lunch specials are great too."}
{"text":"I have been to Glenway countless times and always had a good experience. They have the best outdoor dining in Belmont, great NC beers on draft, and mouthwatering salads and wings!"}
{"text":"If this place is near 40% capacity don't expect to eat. We have been sitting here for over an hour waiting on 2 burgers. Sorry but #servicefail. To be successful in business you have to offer a valuable product, quality of service and a friendly attitude."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience at Glenway.  I went there, 10/14/17 Saturday night with my family about 6:30.  Things started out fine, seated outside on the patio with a nice crowd.  The server got our drink order,  OMB Copper, a sweet tea and waters for 3 and that is when thing start to go down hill...  she came back with our drinks and we ordered our food.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, fish & chips and for my 1 year old son, the chicken fingers with fries.  I asked the fingers and fries to come out first. The OMB tasted stale and tap the lines  haven't been cleaned in awhile.  After about 30/40 minutes ALL of our food came and I asked for extra napkins. With a 1 year  old, we needed them.  She never brought out extra napkins and the food was absolutely terrible.  The chicken fingers we SO burnt, we threw them away and I got the wrong order all together and the fish was paper thin, more breading than fish.  I calmly told our server about my concerns.  after about 30 minutes I sternly asked to speak to the manager and that is when she told me she thought I was joking when I told about our food.  20 minutes after that Randy came by to talk to us about our experience.  He explained that our server was one of his best, she definitely didn't show it that night and that he would \"take care of it\". We discussed that our bad experience was just and anomaly and does happen often... I completely agreed. I have been going to Glenway on a regular basis for years... not living in the area, I make there about 8 to 10  times a year.  I thanked Randy. 15 minutes later he came back, he handed my bill.  He didn't take \"care\" of anything and offered my a 10 dollar gift care to come back... I need to apologize to Randy, because I went off the handle a little with him and used some language that I normally wouldn't use BUT I felt completely insulted and belittled by his lack of effort and offer of the 10 dollar gift card set me off.  As a former manager of TWO restaurants, a wing joint in Charlotte and an Italian family restaurant in Pineville, what should have been done is Randy should have apologized, took care of the WHOLE bill and offered any incentive for me to come back.  For the record, I will not go back to Glenway and I still tipped the server 20% on our $42.72 bill.  Randy's lack of effort and insulting way of NOT to comp a meal, lost this customer."}
{"text":"The food is the best in town; I highly recommend the wings, burgers, salads, and BBQ.  Prices are average.  They have a decent beer selection but for a place calling itself a \"premium pub\" they could do better.  My only real issue here is the service and it is spotty.  Every time I have been in I have waited minutes at the door before being greeted--not a huge deal but it is nice to be greeted by a hostess when you enter a place.  The waitresses are also hit or miss; it can be really infuriating to have hostess/waitstaff standing at the back talking while you wait to be seated or for a refill and I have witnessed this on more than one occasion.  The patio is nice but does allow smoking which is a big negative for me.  Overall this place is great as far as the food but could be outstanding with more beer selection and better service; even as is it is the best restaurant in Belmont!"}
{"text":"Great food great service can not say one bad think about this  place except watch the step going in the front door"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but there's just something about the place that makes me uncomfortable.  Don't really feel welcome here."}
{"text":"What a neat place to stop on a Sunday afternoon.  They guys enjoyed the sportsbar atmosphere.  The margarita was awesome and the other drinks spot on.  
We sat inside in a comfy booth.  The patio was busy and looked pleasant on this sunny day.

The food came out really fast.... too fast.  It was not possible to make that burger that fast.  Indeed... it was dry and cold and the cheese didn't even melt.  I had the Chicken Cobb salad, that was chock full of goodies like avocado, real bacon, chopped eggs, great salad dressing, but the chicken was cold and dry and felt like last night's leftover straight from the fridge.  No other way to explain how it could be that tough and dry.  Sad... such a good salad missed the mark.  Ditto for the pulled pork sandwich.  Just sloppy delivery.  There were chunks of meat that included the dry heel.  To big to eat... it should have been chopped, or pulled.  Again, a disappointment, because the bun and chips were great.  On a brighter note... the meatloaf sandwich was a #10.  

The server asked how things were at the end of the meal... we let her know and she was sincerely interested and was going to let the kitchen know.   I would come back and give it another go.  I believe in letting a good restaurant know when someone drops the ball.  
I wouldn't pass them by-- because the quality IS there, just poor delivery today."}
{"text":"Superb!  My husband and I LOVE Glenway Premium Pub!  We rate all the following excellent:  Big Fish Sandwich, Orchard Salad, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Meatloaf Sandwich, and the BlackBean Cake Salad with Steak. All of these are 5 Star. The Chicken Wings we give 3 Stars, they just weren't our style. Not everything in any restaurant is going to be a favorite.  Great, Great Food!  
Welcome to Belmont!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat.  Great wings and the salmon salad is the best.  Wings are killer."}
{"text":"I went for lunch so regretfully had to pass on the beer selection.  They have a huge crowd for lunch so be prepared for not a  quick lunch.  We had two apps: homemade chips with blue cheese and the redneck eggrole. ....both were fantastic!  Those redneck  eggrole were an ingenious way to serve collard greens!  I had the garlic parm wings which were ok.  The burger looked great though and another friend had grilled salmon salad which she confirmed was really good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Although it's a pub (with a great beer selection!) the food is so so good. Everything we've had is delicious, but the Orchard Salad is my go-to."}
{"text":"If you are in Belmont this is a place you can find a pint of beer and fast service.  This is one of the local hangouts - everyone that came in knew a ton of people there.

We have been thinking about moving to Belmont and places like this would make us feel right at home right away.

There were a ton of taps and a VERY fast bartender - my favorite.  Good selection of wine if you are not feeling the beer that day too.

We did not get the food here but our friends did and it looked very good.  A huge chalkboard will give you an up to date list of the rotating beer list.  Thanks guys for making us feel at home!  :-D"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight. Have to say it was excellent. We had the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese  which were cooked perfect. Along with the Red Raidar sliders and chicken wings. The service was great and this was on a Friday night. We will be returning"}
{"text":"Have been here many times. The service and food is always fantastic. Their beer selection rotates and they always have a wide variety on the special board. They also offer a patio which is great during nice weather visits. 

The Boom Boom Shrimp is an item I get every visit, it serves as a great appetizer or nice snack. Their Whiskey Chicken is another go to item. 

Todays visit consisted of a couple beers and BB Shrimp at the bar, since Wes Golden declined my invite. The shrimp, beers, and service were great, Thanks!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here so this review is just based on the bar experience I had the other day while my girlfriend and I were in town eating somewhere else.  I really liked the feel of this bar.  There's nothing specific I can put my finger on but it was just cozy and it wasn't very crowded.  Sometimes you just want to have a drink somewhere that isn't packed out.

The beer selection could be a little bit better but I'll chalk that up to it being a place that probably caters more to domestic drinkers than craft beer drinkers.  The bar staff were great and friendly and it really felt like a neighborhood type place."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Our party tried the fried fish, burgers and turkey burger and all were excellent.  Great atmosphere as well.  Beer selection was wonderful."}
{"text":"Collard green rolls was delicious! Salmon and black bean was so good. Fish and chips was so good and crunchy 
My waitress Brooklyn was so fun and bubbly. 
My first time experience here was overall excellent. Also great Long Island ice tea."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here because my favorite Belmont spots are closed on Sunday's. This is a sports bar/pub and didn't have high expectations for food. I was pleasantly surprised. 

The pork chops were awesome. They were thick and cooked to perfection. The sauce on them complimented it really well.

The side was grits and veggies. The grits, which I'm not real keen on we're tasty.

I left dinner very pleased I wound up here. I'll be back on my next work trip. 

Overall = A-"}
{"text":"Can be hard to grab a table here during busy times but the food is fantastic. I recommend the steak tenderloin salad-delicious! Lots of beers on tap and great bartenders."}
{"text":"First time. Wondering if it will be the last. Waiting almost an hour for our food and drinks to arrive, we were on the verge of walking out. 

We took a table on the deck because it was a perfect night outside. A little crowded that's what sparked our interest from the street. Either it's amazingly good food, or it's such a small town not too many other places for people to go on Friday night. 

We were not impressed. A few reasons I'll state below. 

It took 45 minutes to almost an hour for our food and drinks to come to the table, warm beer folks! And no our beers didn't just magically show up, it was after we asked and waved to get attention from the waitress. 

We are sober, watching all the drunk people around us receive excellent service. There were waitresses walking past us without a glance of acknowledgement that we are waiting, not even eye contact.  I could see waitresses mingling with the crowd, but more talking and gabbling than actual serving. 

Food and Taste: I wasn't too impressed with the burger that I received. A plain jane if you asked me. Standard. A massive chunk of lettuce doused with mayo and barely any seasoning on the meat. For the wait, it was not worth it and not a repeat. The only part that was good was our appetizer (Nachos) and fries. 

In the end, receiving our check. The typical apologetic waitress is sorry for the service we received. I do appreciate the apology, but sometimes that's just not enough, first your apology is way too late, and second if you are truly sorry that we had a disservice tonight, drinks or at least the appetizer should be on you, or the manager to give us a 10% discount. Something that lets us know that you cared for your customers. We received none of that."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. Fantastic atmosphere. Great food. Wonderful presentation. Friendly staff. 
When my family and I moved to the area we sought out our new \"go to place\" for dinner, drinking and football game watching. This place is all of that for us.... and more. Great daily specials. And my favorite, very nice selection of local beers."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Burgers and fries are outstanding. Seating is crowded.  Service excellent"}
{"text":"Beer selection was very good. They had a good variety for all types of beer drinkers. Atmosphere was very upbeat and they have an outdoor patio with tvs. Had the wings and they were cooked very well and to my liking. They also had a lot of unique flavors to choose from. Overall I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time, after moving close by. Pretty excited. Wings were awesome! Buffalo chicken sandwich, California Burger, Cialis Burger and Blackened Shrimp Salad were all fantastic! My 17 months old nephew also loved the blue cheese dressing, on everything."}
{"text":"It's definitely a place for the locals of Belmont to hang out.  They have a big, covered patio with TV's.  It was an easy walk around the block from the Main Street passing the old train depot and some of the historic train cars they have.

Plenty of tables inside with good TV's as well.  Our server was very friendly.  We were glad they were open.

We had hiked the Seven Oaks Preserve Trail and I wanted to show my sweetie the cute downtown area.  Most everything was closed though.  I forget I live in the South where things are closed on Sunday in some of the smaller communities."}
{"text":"Restrooms only accommodate one person at a time.  For a place of this size, surprising."}
{"text":"Went to Glenway at the suggestion of a co-worker. Ordered the West Coast burger, and fried green tomatoes from Glenway Pub.  I'm not an expert on FGT but they were really hard, but tasted fine. I didn't send them back b/c I honestly dont know what they are suppose to be like. I've had others that were softer that I preferred. The goat cheese was a nice touch. Corn medley they put on top was tasty too. 
The burger was cooked perfectly. Being a west coast girl, who loves avocado on anything this spoke to me on a deep level.  
Service was pretty darn decent for small town pub at noon. I was working on my phone, and didn't want to be bothered a whole lot, and I love when people get that. If I needed anything I just had to look at the new bartender & her magic bartender skills alerted her, and  she was there with a smile. She was great. The bartender who was moving to a different spot (I overheard this) put out amazing customer service on her last day which is really commendable in this day and age."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food in Belmont. They are hidden around the corner, but trust me... much better than Sammy's. I love the Boom Boom Shrimp tacos, the shrimp was plump and tasty! They also have a great beer selection and Bloody Mary bar on Sundays! Woohooo"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Belmont. This place has a neighborhood bar kind of feel where locals hang out. The food is good I have had the fish and chips,the shrimp salad and a burger. The atmosphere is chilled,good selection of adult beverages, it's just a neat place to have dinner or go out for a drink."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about there food an my friend had been before . This place knows good food it's a pub but it's not just bar food. We started with the redneck egg rolls yum . It's an egg roll stuffed with collards an I'm a southern girl I know my collards lol They were cooked perfectly tensor an smokey flavor mmmm They serve you 2 cut in half so 4 with a sweet an sour sauce it's so good :)
I ordered the whiskey chicken sandwich it was awesome. The chicken very moist an great flavor from the sauce an they put crispy fried onions on the sandwich mmm if you are in the area or looking for a hole in the wall great place I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful servers. I great place to eat and entertain in Belmont. Great specials."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do! The crowd is great for sports. The draft beer selection is spectacular for a pub in Gaston County. The food is overpriced, but decent. Not worth it if you are making a special trip. The service, though, soooo slow. I've been here enough times to make an informed report. They are very friendly, but just so darn slow. I sit at the bar, for Pete's sake. I just want a beer and a menu within 15 minutes. I'm not asking much, Glenway. Just feed me and give me cold beer. pleeeeaaase!"}
{"text":"Their food and beer menu is really nice and reasonably priced. Monday-Friday is also 1/2 price appetizers from 4p-6p and Wednesday is 1/2 price wine all day. Every app they have is pretty tasty, but honestly, everything I've had there has been so good. Definitely take advantage of the apps, but enjoy other menu goodies too!"}
{"text":"Our fave restaurant in the Charlotte area, hands down! Worth the drive from uptown. 
Great atmosphere, great food, great service!
Best on the menu...
Redneck eggrolls, fried green tomatoes, wings, burgers... basically everything we have tried is on point!"}
{"text":"Wow! This pub has a wonderful atmosphere; it's open and casual. The bar is a great place to grab a beer, get some food, and watch TV. The patio is equally as nice and you can still enjoy the game with the outdoor TVs. The menu is expansive with many great options. The fried green tomatoes are excellent (love that goat cheese!). The orchard salad was also delicious. They make great use of goat cheese at this eatery; the have it in many of their sandwiches, salads, and entrees. Lots of great local beer choices and a full bar. I don't live exactly close, but I'm sure this is going to be a new favorite spot for me."}
{"text":"I have to give Glenway a hand on their craft beer rotation.  The owner or bar manager really seems to go out their way to make sure good local beer is on tap."}
{"text":"Got the boxcar and I highly recommend it.  Meatloaf was cooked to perfection and whole grains mustard turned it up a notch flavor wise.  Gravy was smooth and were a nice compliment for both the sandwich and fries.  Wife got blackened shrimp salad and while the shrimp were packed with a pinch of spice it was a good flavor.  The wait was 20 minutes which isn't bad for a busy Thursday night.  $3.50 nc pints with a nice beer menu."}
{"text":"Met a co-worker for dinner here.  Very casual setting.  Service was average.  Maybe the server was just having a bad night.  But the food and beer selection were very good.

I ordered the fish and chips and had a few different beers.  I believe this place has the same owners as the Copper Pub in my town.  Hard to tell... which isn't a bad thing.  Different menus, environment etc.  

The fish was very well prepared as were the fries.  If you live in Belmont, this would be a place I would recommend be a regular.  If for nothing other than to work your way through the beer menu!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. The service is always terrific.  We had Tristan as our server. Very nice!
They allow dogs on the patio. This is always a big plus!
I think the owner is whom comes around and loves on the dogs. He brings a big bucket of water for them. 
The food is very good. Bar fare, but better. There is an attention to detail lost at most other places. 
I highly suggest getting the bloody Mary bar on Sundays.... yum!
All in all, I think this is one of my favorite places in Belmont."}
{"text":"I have never eaten anything here that I didn't like. Also a great place to go for a good beer as they have a very large craft beer selection with lots of local and seasonal brews. The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable!"}
