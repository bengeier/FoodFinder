{"text":"I've come in to this bakery several times. When my husband and I visit a bakery for the first time we almost always order the works. Bakery prices are cheaper than restaurants usually so we can try many things on their menu to know if we like their food. 
That time we ordered about four pastries, a flan and a pudding and we ordered a pork burrito and steak burrito. The burritos were disappointing because they were poorly filled. We were expecting rice, beans, lettuce and onions along with meat, they only gave us meat! We had specifically ordered burritos on the menu that had more ingredients. I've also tried their flan, it's a  lazy attempt. If you try it you may agree. It has little flavor.

  I would have ordered more food dishes here because the pictures on their menu look very appetizing but the two times I have come in to do so, no one was at the register. I rang the bell and no one came out or they said to wait and never came out. 

Their bread is good which is why I have returned a couple of times since my first visit. The place is nice inside and the tables are usually neat and clean. Unfortunately  they have poor service. I always come in and smile and make sure to be friendly and the two ladies I've been met by at the registers aren't friendly at all. Since they don't seem to appreciate my patronage I'm just going to start going to another bakery. Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying their sweet bread, I got a donut and started eating before paying. Of course I shouldn't have, but it was just too tempting. When I was in line the cashier was having a blast talking to the customer. I thought maybe he's a regular or so and that's why. When it was our turn, she was the same, very nice girl. I had eaten most of my donut by then and she was joking about it. The ambient is very homie, and the bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Randomly went here after dinner on a Friday figuring it should be open until 9PM. They have traditional Mexican casual food and baked goods. 

The lady and I awkwardly spoke Spanglish back and forth and I ordered her suggestions of cake and \"elote\" (not corn but some dough wrapped cheese mystery cylindrical baked good.) The cake with it's syrup soaked strawberry, whipped cream, and moist vanilla interior was spot on but I cannot say the same for the \"elote.\" I also am pretty sure I had the white girl mark up or this place is expensive for a Mexican bakery as the receipt did not have any itemization, no prices were listed in the store, and it was a rather high bill. La Purisima is still my go to for baked goods but I might come back to try the food."}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE!

I stopped by to pick up some mexican sweet bread this past sunday. WORST MISTAKE.
got maybe around 10 pieces of bread MAX, and i asked if they had green chicken tamales and she said let me check went to the back and then yelled from the door asking how many i wanted i said 6 and she says okay rings them up and then says oh but by the way they are pork not chicken..... um okay i asked for chicken so i said nevermind i can't eat pork i was looking for chicken...

rings me up tells me the total is $10 and some change. i had her my debit card and she swipes it and gives me the reciept and says oh we also charge 50 cents for debit transactions..... well thanks i guess you could of let me know before to see if i had cash.

i check my bank account monday moring and they charges me $18 and cents. WTF!!! i gave them a call and said the owner would call me back.... nothing! i called a few times after that and nothing. its now wednesday and still havent heard back....

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE OR THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting my brother who lives 3 blocks from this place. I walked over to this place for coffee & was I surprised... I got my coffee & pan dulce, but also got 2 carne asada tacos. My husband \"special\" ordered  2 grilled chicken tacos with rice beans & eggs. I regret not snapping a picture of his amazing plate. My son wanted egg tacos so we requested another special order. 2 egg tacos with cheese. He ate it ALL!! It was a plate I would've cooked had I been home. The flavored in the food were so good & the price was affordable. Now if I can only relocate them 2 blocks from my house in CA!"}
{"text":"Went there for a breakfast burrito and I must say it was delicious.  In my opinion,  best one in the neighborhood. Ordered the bacon, egg, and potato and had them add beans n cheese. It weighted about 2 lbs. Salsa was great too. Will be back again.

There was a bit of wait but well worth it. They seem to stay busy with the bakery and all!"}
{"text":"This really is a dive but the food was great. We ended up here because another place we planned to go to was closed. I had the chicken gordita. Totally authentic and delish. They have a wall of different pastries and a salsa bar with fresh salsas."}
