{"text":"I'm not sure if any of these other reviewers have eaten at a real Crepe restaurant but I give this restaurant two stars for a very ho hum mediocre experience.  The atmosphere was the all too typical and anonymous suburban plaza setting that is ubiquitous to this region.  Interior decorations did more to hurt the place than add any real ambiance.  Fake bouquet flowers adorned the tables, kitchy collections of flower and animal pieces cluttered the small serving room in way that would make any of the shows on HGTV have a fit.  My girlfriend and I tried to remain open minded because the proof is in the pudding they say or for this meal the crepes.  We ordered two cafe au latte's and they tasted like watered down steeped coffee bags with some milk poured in; not the double expresso or thick coffee with a quarter inch of frothy milk you might expect with a cafe au latte.  The crepes were served, like the water, in ugly plastic ware.  The crepes themselves were certainly nothing to write home about either.  I don't call myself a crepe connoisseur although I am a food critic and these crepes were mediocre at best.  My bar is raised high a by a little authentic Parisian crepe restaurant in Pittsburgh, pa called crepes parisian - check it out if your ever there.  Anyway, the crepes were decent; they certainly weren't great.  Ingredients seemed fresh and its tough to mess up a crepe but they didn't have anything fancy for that extra pizazz.  Not even a nice bechamel sauce or something to adorn the tops of the crepes which I am accustomed too.  All in all, we paid $27.00 with tip for a forgetful and for the most part disappointing crepe experience and the only we reason we went is because of the complete dearth of crepe places in the phoenix metro area.  We will be making our own crepes next time."}
{"text":"So, I entered the small Patisserie that is known as Crepes and Bakes.  The place had a nice quaint look with sitting inside and out.  Sitting down, inside, we were greeted by who I expect was the owner.  She was very friendly and very helpful.  Looking through the menu I of course found a huge selection of crepes, but also found sandwiches, salads, soups, omelettes/ scrambles, and french toast.  This of course is a crepe place so why order anything else?  The question was did I want a sweet, savory, or breakfast crepe.  I decided to go with a sweet fresh strawberry crepe with custard.  I split that with a friend who went with a breakfast scrambled egg crepe, with salmon and cream cheese.  The owner/ waitress asked if we would like to add capers or onions for no extra charge.  We went with the capers, no onions. Another guest with me went with the nutella french toast.  The food arrived and everything looked amazing.  The strawberry crepes were great.  The crepes even seemed to have homemade whipped cream, which just added to the great taste.  The breakfast salmon crepe was awesome, too.  There were just enough capers to dot the scrambled eggs without being too strong.  I would highly recommend it.  I had a bite of the nutella french toast and it like everything else was very good.  The nutella gave it a unique, but good, taste that is typically not found in the United States.  I would definitely go back and orders from the crepe section without hesitation."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in the Phoenix metro area!  Of course, I love crepes (so that helps).  This little gem is tucked away in an upscale shopping plaza at Scottsdale and Indian Bend.   Delicious crepes  They have sweet, savory and even breakfast crepes!  They have your standard types (such as Nutella) as well as some unique choices (such as strawberry custard - my personal favorite).  Crepes and  Bakes has a great, relaxing atmosphere as well.  The outdoor seating is the perfect setting for a laid back breakfast on a lazy weekend morning.  If you like crepes, I highly recommend Crepes and Bakes."}
