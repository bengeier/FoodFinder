{"text":"It's not pretty, but sure as hell gets the job done! I am writing this review solely based on the food court area - quite frankly, it is one of the only reasons to come here.

When you do arrive, try to avoid looking at the dirty tables, the disgusting walls, the poor condition of the kitchens, the fact they leave their produce in front of the stalls, and a whole lot of other issues. I have been coming in since I was a kid and mother has changed. To this day - not sure how it passes inspection but it does.

The 'food court' consists of two vendors. Both of them very good. Like another reviewer said, you can't go wrong with either option. Today we bought from Goodies, who is the one in the middle. We bought stir fried beef noodle.

Portion sizes here are very good, you can feed 2-3 people with one. Flavour wise, it was pretty good - typical Chinese food taste made to order. I also got the fish with fried eggplant which is a more unique take on the dish. It too was not too bad albeit a bit salty.

Overall, if you ignore the aesthetics of the place and are looking for some decent and cheap Chinese food, come here!"}
{"text":"When do I recommend a food court stall purely based on quantity not quality?  When a single order of stir fried noodle can feed 3 women OR 2 men.  

I came to Dragon Centre for lunch because I was in the area, and I was curious about what the mall had become.  The mall was quiet on a Saturday noon, and half of the stores were not opened.  The mall condition was not horrible, as it was relatively clean.  The food court, however, was in poor condition: it looked old, run down and not brightly lit.  (I put it in detail so that readers can mentally prepare for the condition and not be turned off by it)  There were 3 stalls operating in the food court.  I ordered from Hung Food which was at the far end, and where most of the other customers were lining up for. My stir fried noodle order was HEAVY in weight, packed FIRM and piled HIGH.  There were lots of shrimps on top (see picture uploaded).  I thought it was for show, but when I dug deeper, there were many chunks of chicken.  Other than that, it was just noodle, no vegetable.  Now the noodle tasted just okay; one could even say it tasted below average.  To me, it was nothing some chili oil could not fix. I ate and ate, got full and ate some more.  When I was done, I finished the top layer that sticked up above the top of the box!   There was still one full box of noodle, and I planned on eating it over 2 meals.  This 3-meal-in-1 order costed $7.50, tax inclusive.

I noticed most of the other customers were ordering catering.  I also noticed that the food in the catering trays was piled up so high that it almost formed a half circle above the top of the trays.  I wondered if the customers had to buy another aluminum tray to scrap off the top first, so that the food would not fall all over when they ate it."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.  Cecilia Caf√© is no longer here.  Not sure what happened but their space is closed and for lease."}
{"text":"Dragon Centre used to be gold like a decade ago! Long gone are those days and is now a run down motel tacky present time with a few businesses like the dimsum resto still able to survive as well as \"the fried chicken and fried rice place\" located inside the plaza ( Sadly don't know the name, my 10yr old literally calls it this).

Still pulling in fans from Scarborough's loyal residential and industrial areas. I still happen to make the rare trip to get some cheap grub whenever in the area. Portions are incredible bursting with enough to go around for 2-3 people under $10! 

Reminds me of days when I was broke, in school, odd jobs and living the budget mind bending strategies and this place fit the bill perfectly.

The lady owner has always been grumpy and meagre on the hot sauce. Like it's hot sauce, not gold flakes but me likah alotta da chi-kan!!!"}
{"text":"Dragon Centre has this little dining area tucked away in left back corner and they're madly good. 
The serve you a container of rice (filled) and literally covered with fried chicken.  The chicken is crispy but not dry and it tasted amazing. It's around $8.75 and can fill you and a friend or enough for left-overs.
It seems a little sketchy but hey, they've been around for a while & if nobody has died or heavily complained + passing the health inspection ... it's good enough for me.
The workers are also very proficient in English so there should be no barrier in communication."}
{"text":"I have fond memory of Dragon Centre. This is the first ever Chinese Mall I visited when I arrived in Toronto years ago....

It was a comforting experience as seeing all these familiar stores selling products from home and food court serving tasty Chinese food.

Fast forward to now... Dragon Centre is No longer the to go place for any of the above. Now Markham is where all the action is!

Come during a weekday afternoon, most of the stores are closed... but the good thing is there's tons of parking spaces!!"}
{"text":"When I was younger, I loved Sailor Moon. I don't know why, I don't know how I chose Sailor Moon out of all the cartoon characters, I just loved Sailor Moon (Sailor Jupiter was my favourite because she had brown hair. This is the logic of 8-year-old girls.).

Anyway, I begged my mother to take me to the Dragon Centre so I could use the machines to get the Sailor Moon trading cards/stickers. And there was a wealth of machines here, as well as a bunch of places that sell Chinese buns and knockoff clothes.

Nowadays they have the same kinda stuff, except the decor has not changed since then. A bit dated. But they have a decent food court area where you can get crazy cheap takeout, and now you can get those little Winnie The Pooh phone charm things in the machines for $1 instead of $2! What a deal."}
{"text":"The pride of Scarberia. It doesnt get more ghetto-er than this spot right here. Tables are grimy and walls are just as horrific, but the food coming out of the kitchen is excellent. Portions are huge and the prices are very affordable. A true hole in the wall. Voted Best Takeout Spot by Potheads Anonymous and Munchies Inc. for 20 years straight."}
