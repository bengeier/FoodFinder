{"text":"The location is beautiful!! My husband and I went to dinner last night and everything was going well. Our server was super nice. However we noticed the blond bartender talking horrible about a group of people sitting at another table. We saw the whole thing go down and the bartender is in the wrong. She was mean! My husband and I were shocked how horrible she was treating customers. It ruined our night and we will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place for dinner and drinks! Food was great, service attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wish we could love this place as it is in our own backyard but the service is awful! Don't try it unless you have 2 hours to waste while waiting for your mediocre food. Today 2 of our 6 kids meals showed up 15 minutes after the rest of our food and they weren't even taken off of our bill."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. Party of 8, and most of the food was mediocre. One meal was wrong-burger ordered without jalapenos had them, and salmon was very dry. Apology for salmon and credit for the dinner, but nothing for the jalapenos. Service was poor as well. Will not be returning. Corn bread was good and surroundings were very nice."}
{"text":"Start with pro's.  Food was good as usual! Location is immaculate as the sunset here is a prime spot. Bartender was very quick from what we could see, but we didn't order from the bar. Cook was very apologetic from the inaccuracy of the order and removed that meal off the bill. Which brings me to the cons.. Cons: Server was slow paced and forgetful. Took about 15 minutes to order our drinks then food. (Traditionally customers order drinks, then a few minutes later order food, but not at the same time as each other) food came out ONE HOUR later and one of the three meals were not what we ordered. Took an additional 10 minutes for the correct plate. Server also asked if my girl wanted a refill of water, (she said yes please) but never returned with a glass or a refill. I am very disappointed in the turnout of this evening because I talked the place up so much to my girl and sadly it was a bad choice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and loved the live music on Sunday nights. Got the chicken pot pie and a large salad. The pie was good-- much different than expected. The salad was uninspired and not great. Love the location and hope the food keeps getting better."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  The BEST sunset view in North Scottsdale! Great food and great wine! Jamie and Austin are the BOMB!! If you have never been here....what are you waiting for....go!"}
{"text":"They have the best location and patio in Scottsdale.  This place would be great if the food was good.  My family and I have given it so many chances, ordering something different every time.  The food is just not good.  I think the quality of the food that they use is below par.  The nachos, wings, and even salads are disappointing to say the least.  On the good side, they have a good happy hour and a nice wine selection.  Please do something with the food......we love to come here after golfing."}
{"text":"Beautiful view on patio, comfortable chairs and table, attentive staff.   Burger and tuna melt good"}
{"text":"We decided to get a bite to eat after golf and since this is in my neighborhood was hoping for it to be good. They seemed understaffed. I ordered the chicken sAlad with Raspberry Viniagrette. The salad came with ice berg lettuce, was overly dressed and had dark chicken (grilled) on it. It was not very good. My husband ordered a hot dog and fries. He said the hot dog was good, and fries fine. But when the bill came we were charged $7 for the hot dog and another $6 for the fries. My salad was $8. I hope they are working on something because it was not a good experience and sad we only have the Twisted Lizzard to eat at locally."}
{"text":"Food isn't great but the setting is!  Beautiful views of sunset mountain and city."}
{"text":"Never fun to negatively review a place that has so much potential.  The view, AMAZING, the service and food... less then desirable.  The wait for your food is very long and when it finally arrives it is sub par.  It's a bit like the twilight zone at times, no apologies and almost like its normal for a sale to take 45 minutes.  Time for new management, chef and menu."}
{"text":"WOW.  What a great experience!  We came in on a Sunday evening to experience ALL-DAY Happy Hour, Live Music from the incredible Ryan Sims, and one of the most beautiful views in Scottsdale.  The food and drinks were outstanding, as was the service.    I can't wait to return for another night of music at sunset."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Management needs to pay attention to lack of people to do the job.  This is an incredible location. Gorgeous restaurant, good food, with no people working."}
{"text":"The view is amazing! The food was great as was service. Took my mother-in-law who also enjoyed it. We had lunch - my chicken wrap was great as we're the sweet pot fries.  I've also enjoyed their appetizers and wine. Overall - good experience."}
{"text":"The food is quite good here but the service is terrible. The servers are nice but they are way understaffed in the kitchen and on the floor. 45+ minute waits once you've ordered are more the norm than the exception. It's a shame the service and overall restaurant management is so poor because we like the food.  Today is especially bad which is surprising since it's not too busy. We've waited over 45 minutes with no food in site. Our kids are getting restless so we've decide to get up and leave hungry and frustrated.   Hopefully they read these reviews and get their act together. Understaffed and slow seem to be a common theme."}
{"text":"On this occasion the food was mediocre and the service was slow.  I do like the ambience here but it was a little frustrating today!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Good variety of food: husband had macho nachos, I had beet and kale salad. Well prepared and reasonable price. We sat on patio and enjoyed incredible view of golf course, desert and mountains, not to mention an entertaining show of hummingbirds. Restaurant is actually at the clubhouse of Mcdowell Mountain Golf Club. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant set in a beautiful backdrop, but unfortunately the service was pretty bad tonight.   Not sure if the server was overwhelmed or what, but it took him over 15 minutes to come take our initial drink orders, and then they were wrong.   It just went downhill from there.   The food was delicious, it's just a shame that they didn't have more staff on for one of the busiest nights of the week."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the Mesquite Grill has delivered on Food and service. It has a very upscale look to the restaurant that opens up into the patio to a view of the golf course. On a warm day it can be a little stuffy since they don't have ceiling fans. The sun will be in your eyes outdoors about an hour or so before sunset. Otherwise, outdoors is a good option any other time.  Now on to the food. I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the make your own burger. Both options would be excellent choices when you want to keep your bill to a reasonable level. They have higher cost items like steaks or ribs. This is a great date night place or just meet with a group of friends over some drinks and some good food. The service was great every time I've been here.  After my most recent trip here, I'm going to have to relegate some of those other North Scottsdale eateries to the bench and put the Mesquite Grill into my starting lineup."}
{"text":"Food.....8+ Service ..10 Ambiance.   10 Prices........8  Brought some out of towners here for lunch and we all agreed that it was a nice spot.  I'd read some reviews that were not promising, but more frequent ones that sounded encouraging.  Everyone liked their lunch and the service was terrific.  I'll be back, and I expect it will become a regular for us.  Having lunch there this Tuesday with two friends."}
{"text":"The view of the course is spectacular. The service and food left much to be desired. A very young staff in need of leadership and organization."}
{"text":"The Mesquite  Grill has to be one of the worst run restaurants I have ever consistently experienced. Food quality fair at best. Service non existent at best. Now here is the perverbial straw that broke the camel's back. What restaurant goes 10 days in a row without air conditioning in June in Arizona? Answer, this one. Don't  you think Phil Mickelson, who is financially commited to this golf course restaurant, can afford a new AC unit? At this restaurant, the customer  gets a double bogey."}
{"text":"You wil note that most favorable reviews are of lunch or pre-dinner hour experiences. That's because the miserably understaffed grill can handle the light attendance then. At dinner it's another matter. 10 tables per waiter. Astonishingly long waits. Terrible service--primarily because they are overwhelmed. This is an upper management problem--and since this has been the case for over three years, it is unlikely to change. The food is okay (once you get it; prepare for an hour wait). What makes this a shame is that the view and the facility is wonderful. We have given them every chance--dining there at three- and six-month intervals. No improvements. Too bad a potentially excellent experience is ruined."}
{"text":"Great food and not over priced.  Great view, great atmosphere.  My service was less than spectacular to say the least, but I'm not going to rate based on that.  I was worried about the price due to the location and look of this place, but there were great choices on the menu at a decent price."}
{"text":"This review makes me sad, as I had such a great experience here before.   We were so excited to have Mother's Day brunch here. They have a great view overlooking Scottsdale.   The brunch was mediocre at best with a very limited offering that reminds someone of the free continental breakfast that comes with a holiday inn. When we got the bill we were beyond surprised...  $40/pp + a $14 mimosa!  To add insult to our experience is the automatic 20% post tax tip for a really nice waiter that visited our table a grand total of 3 times over 1.5 hours.   Whoever decided this was a good idea needs to regroup. Either have a brunch truly worth $40/pp or adjust your prices to reflect a total of 10 mediocre offerings."}
{"text":"The food was great.......would have given at least 4 stars, HOWEVER, it took 40 minutes to get our lunch. We asked for a high chair 3 times. Our young male waiter was definitely not a happy camper. There were about 5 or 6 tables between 2 waiters, not sure why the kitchen was so slow. I am so confused as to why the service was so bad. I will try again but if it happens again, which is likely by looking at the other reviews, then I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience eating there tonight! Originally there were no seats out on the patio when we wanted to sit outside but we settled for indoors, about 5 minutes later, someone who seemed to be the manager told us there would be an available table outside if we would like to move! We were so excited and thankful since they could've seated someone else out there, but they were thoughtful enough to seat us out there! The view was spectacular and we got to watch the moon rise over the mountains! The food was amazing, service was very polite! We will definetly be returning and appreciate the caring and dedicated customer service! Try this place out if you haven't! It took my breathe away!"}
{"text":"What a spectacular view, beautiful patio with a wonderful fireplace.  Service was great could not have been treated any better, great wine selection and with 1/2 bottles on Saturday nights makes it even better. The menu selection has great verity, I really enjoyed the Sun Devil Salad and the Fish tacos are wonderful."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day brunch ... AMAZING view, great food, good service.  I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"I always recommend this place to visitors. The view of the golf course is fantastic and I love eating on the patio! Nights when they have live music are so great as well. All of the food we've tried is excellent. This a great spot for date night too."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a beautiful place and amazing service from Sheree!!  I just wanted to stay and hangout with her actually!!  Amazing wine selection and great food though, will be back ASAP!!"}
{"text":"The Mesquite Grille is the restaurant at the McDowell Mountain Ranch Golf Course. My husband and I stopped by for lunch on a Thursday recently and were pleasantly surprised. The main entrance is a humungous wooden door that is beautiful and surprisingly not heavy. The inside is decorated with other wooden accents and looks how I would imagine a golf club restaurant to look. Swanky yet down to earth with some Sonoran touches. Since it was a beautiful fall afternoon, we choose to sit on the patio where we were able to overlook the greens and watch golfers practice their swing.   Our waitress was quick to arrive and take our drink orders. The menu is on the simple side and nothing too fancy. My husband opted to go with their burger and onion rings. The waitress advised that they weren't traditional onion rings so much as a shoestring version. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and asked if the regular fries or sweet potato fries were better. The waitress said both were good and offered to do a split of both. That sounded good so I agreed.   We didn't have to wait very long for our food, it arrived rather quickly. My husband enjoyed his burger and the onion \"rings\" were good as well. They were thicker than shoestring, but not traditional rings - more like half rings and plenty of them. My tacos were outstanding. They came with a side of guacamole and salsa, so I could top them as I pleased. The mahi mahi was delicious and seasoned well. Even my husband was a little jealous. The sweet potato fries were much better than the regular fries - the regular fries were thick cut and not very crispy. (If you've read any of my previous reviews, you'll know I'm a stickler on French fries and how I like mine.)   Overall, it was an enjoyable lunch. The food and service were good, the patio was nice to sit at, and best of all, the restaurant is really close to both work and home. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very slow service on a Saturday night. Food was decent but the slow service made it an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"We were in a golf tournament on Saturday with 60 other golfers. After we finished, we headed to the restaurant for lunch.  To our surprise, there were no servers to be seen. I went up to the bar and there was only one bartender and i told him where we were sitting and he said he'd get us a menu. After about ten minutes, one of us got up and retreived them. Another 10 minutes went by and no server.  We waited until the results were announced and still no server. So we went someplace else for lunch. You would think that with a large group, they would be well staffed. They lost a lot of business that day."}
{"text":"Beautiful views, great service and the food was excellent! The sliders were amazing! Good happy hour as well"}
{"text":"I was there last Friday evening with a friend. No one acknowledged us after we were seated for 10 minutes. Then water was delivered with the menu.  Waited another 10 minutes to order.   Waited another 10 minutes. Waiter came and told us he had misplaced our order. Food came out cold. Not very happy. Should have been offered our meal without charge. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"We were there for a Sunday afternoon lunch and the service was super slow because they only had one person serving the entire patio.  Management seems to miss the fact  that on a fine Sunday afternoon people would want to be dining on the patio.  Otherwise why would you only have one person running around trying to serve so many tables?"}
{"text":"You can't beat Sunday all day happy hour and live music! They also have music Thursday and Friday ( I think). I recommend going early enough to see the sunset!"}
{"text":"Outstanding halibut special last night!   Very tender cut perfectly grilled.  I would have given 5 stars but it needed something else besides 5 very small spears of asparagus on the side.  Knowledgable wait staff.  I took a friend visiting from Kansas City to enjoy the beautiful patio view looking out over the city lights.  This has to be one of the best patio views in North Scottsdale.  Very talented vocalist playing acoustic guitar.  A lovely way to spend a relaxing evening.  A best kept secret, but please share!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night for a more low key, but still refined dinner. The food was great and very reasonably priced. We came here shortly before sunset and the view was spectacular!   We both started with salads; for my dad, the beet salad and the Greek salad for me. Our waiter had gave me a heads up after I told him what I wanted that my salad was a pasta salad and there were no greens in it (which isn't what I had in mind). So thankfully, he politely offered to swap the pasta out for romaine which I really appreciated! As for mains, my dad ordered three tacos - chicken, fish and steak and I ordered just the chicken and fish. Our salads and tacos had a beautiful presentation and were delicious. We also both enjoyed glasses of Chardonnay and Sauv. Blanc) with our meal.   Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you REALLY want to like a restaurant, even before going there?  That's how I felt about the Mesquite Grille, since it's located about 2 minutes from our home here at McDowell Mountain Ranch.  Walking in the door the setting was upscale comfortable and quiet.  A TV was showing soccer over the bar, and we opted for the booths (the place was nearly empty on a Tuesday night).    For the appetizer, I had the iceberg wedge, as this is one of my favorite salads, however, this had to be one of the smallest wedges I've seen.  It was topped with a blue cheese dressing, blue cheese crumbles, and two small tomato wedges, a very austere version compared to other versions I've had.  This was followed by the green pork chile taco entree.  Despite coming to the table on a hot plate, in a small, hot metal kettle, the chile itself was surprisingly only mildly warm.  This could be overlooked, but it was about as bland as food as I've ever eaten.  I ate it straight out of the kettle, and it was like eating... nothing.  The chile was supplemented by three soft tacos, cabbage, and salsa for toppings.  A very forgettable meal.  On a more positive note, though, the taco entree came with a side order of french fries (?), an unusual combination, but the fries were hot and crunchy.  Yum!  I may go back again in a while, but my hopes for a close-by neighborhood eatery were dashed with my first visit.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Great spot right on the golf course. They have an excellent happy hour on both food and drink. Their regular menu is also very good. They get busy in the early evenings for happy hour especially on Thursdays and Fridays. Definitely worth coming out getting some food and drink and looking at the beautiful views."}
{"text":"Come here for ambiance: crazy beautiful golf course views, outdoor corn hole, big screen TVs for sports lovers, good live music & wrap-around bar. Great place to bring the kids & let them run around outside while parents chat. I feel happy every time I come here. Food is consistently good but nothing gourmet. I LOVE the Cobb salad."}
{"text":"Food is great, the service is terrible.  We were dumped for a large party.  It took 20 before someone took a our orders.  It took another 20 min after we ate to have someone, not our original server, to ask to see if we wanted anything else.  Then it took 30 minutes to get the check. .again another server.  Terrible terrible terrible."}
