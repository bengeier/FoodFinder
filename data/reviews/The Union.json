{"text":"Wow.  Impressively bad. Where to start? How about the beginning.

I'm a fan of all things beer and bar food.  I seek out everything Mom & Pops/one-off/non-corporate.  Don't get me wrong; Wild Wing Ayrsley & Rock Bottom have their time and place in my repertoire, but I typically prefer the unique, local scenes.  Alas, Hell's will not be one of them.

Service; bartender looked like she was literally lost the entire time.  Sunday @ 3 PM with 6 people at the bar and she couldn't manage.  I watched her clean the same glass at least 4 times, while completely ignoring the patrons' empty drinks.  It was an odd feeling of frustration and complete amusement at her lack of ability.  The other staff member spent her time sitting on a bar cooler eating Snyder's pretzel bites, licking her fingers, petting a dog, and generally doing nothing.  She was apparently \"kitchen staff,\" which-given her extreme lack of hygiene-sadly makes me glad their kitchen is very hands-off, which brings me to my next point.

Food; Overpriced microwavables.  The pretzels ($7) are made in a toaster.  Literally.  The $1 \"beer cheese\" is an unnatural orange-white chunky substance rimmed with separated butter, warmed in a microwave.  It tastes as terrible as it looks/sounds.
  The wings ($10 for 10) were not underdone in a sense of being raw, but texture, as if they'd been pre-fried, frozen, thawed, then nuked.  The mango habanero was not spicy, nor sweet, but rather one-note medium-hot bbq?  The honey sriracha was honey bbq, possibly with a hint of crushed red pepper.  To be frank, for $10 your money would be better spent grabbing a PBR and some McDonalds.  Much better spent at Cook Out.  

Drinks; beer is damn good, if you can get one (see service).  They have an excellent variety from taps to bottles.  I can't speak to their mixed drinks as I didn't trust the bartender to make a simple gin & tonic, but if you can get her attention she can open a bottle well enough.

Atmosphere; great waste of space.  It could be very inviting.  There is ample space, plenty of TVs, and seating.  The lack of management shows though, as the staff can't adequately control the TVs and the games are either dysfunctional or inaccessible.  The specials are decent enough, but there is a huge lack of signage to draw both the local residents and lightrail crowd.

Overall it's sad to see a place with such potential misfiring on every cylinder possible.  There are many bar niches to fill; unfortunately for Helles it's taken the worst aspects of them all.  I can only assume this is a poor attempt to cash in on the area's new development.  In the area you'd be best served by many of the nearby bars.  

TL;DR - Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"They did an awesome job renovating this place.  Great bar, tons of taps, and a cool stage area.  The menu has gone from basic bar food to something much better... not quite gastropub, but much better than I expected.  Especially the avocado fries... Delicious."}
{"text":"My parents and I tried out the lunch they have and were very impressed! Our bartender was very attentive and made sure to check with us frequently to make sure every thing was going alright. I was shocked to hear that they had just started serving food because the club sandwich was very good quality and the wings were larger than most bars. They have a very good selection of beers as well as a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We live in the Pink Building, a block a way.  H&D to become our new neighborhood bar!  Great food, great staff, bring your dog and owner Bart is great.  So comfortable and laid back and so much going on which you can be part of, or tuck away at a quiet table and watch people/street.  The food was great.  Duck quesadilla and, though not on the menu, the chef easily accommodated my vegetarian wife with a veggie quesadilla. Food was great.

Loved it, going back and look forward to their expanded menu."}
{"text":"The beer selection here is great with more taps of craft beer than one could ask for. The prices were a bit high though. Any time the bartender has to go in the back to make the food, it is a bad sign. The flat bread pizza for almost $10 would have been overpriced if it cost $3. The wings too were just something thrown in his magical microwave or EZ bake oven that took a few minutes to whip together."}
{"text":"Only one star because we planned lunch there (website says it opens at 11am), but the kitchen was closed. Super disappointed because reviews are good. Hope they'll update website to accurate info.  We plan to try again - someday."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the beer selection is top notch which is why we come here.  They now have a food menu which is a big plus. Wings, pizza, and some toasted sandwiches. We had the tequila lime wings, and the firecracker chicken appetizers. Ordered the prime rib sub to close the deal. Walked out of there with a great beer buzz. The band rocked it.  Great night out. Great crowd."}
{"text":"I feel as if there are 2 different drinking scenes in South End. You have the brewery scene and then a bar scene. I feel as if Helles & Dunkel falls in between these two environments. The main area is one large bar with tvs (like you would see at All American, Oak Room, or Tavern on the tracks). They also have food, but very few booths so food, to me, doesn't seem to be their main priority. They feel somewhat like a brewery because the atmosphere is sort of low key. Meaning it isn't like a \"party\" scene. They have a huge selection of beers ranging from domestic to craft and local. 

I understand my description of the environment is sort of confusing but if you go I feel as if you'll understand. If you don't feel like going to a brewery but don't feel like going somewhere hectic this place is perfect! It's definitely a go to for a beer in South End. I haven't tried it, but I also hear the sushi is good."}
{"text":"NO GRILL? So being that there are apartments over head, they can not run ducting for a grill hood. Therefore, they can not have a grill, only microwaves or ovens or something like that. The food tasted like it was microwaved. Good bar, but don't come for the food. Someone correct me if I am wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place, it has a wide-ranging and deep beer selection (dozens on tap) at very reasonable prices in what is basically a laid-back but well-attended neighborhood sports bar.  You get the experience minus the annoying pretentiousness.  The burger and fries were top notch, too!!"}
{"text":"This is tough because while the beer selection is ok (needs more porters and stouts from local breweries), and the staff are super nice and friendly, the food just isn't that good. It's basically bar food, which for this side of town is probably a good idea since it's mostly frat boys whose palates aren't quite developed at this stage in life.

Again, decent beer selection, great staff, food just isn't good."}
{"text":"I wake up every morning and ask myself two questions- 'I wasn't that drunk, was I?' and 'I wonder if I will ever be able to find a restaurant that can f**k up bacon-cheese fries?'

Well, I'm here to to tell you friends - I have achieved my quest. 

Helles & Dunkel, with a combination of soggy oven-baked Ore Ida Fries and funky beer cheese, managed to actually prove that it was possible s**t all over a dish that a 1st grader w/ a deep fryer could concoct.  And, I commend them for their effort.

For real, though.  The food here blows.  I hear they have sushi.  But, my question to you is - Do you really want to eat raw fish at a place that can't even figure out how to cook frozen french fries?

They do have beer here.  But, so do other places....  I'd avoid this place and go to better places in South End."}
{"text":"First time here since changing from World of Beer, ambience in much nicer and warmer now like local bar should be, not as corporate.  Just had the Thursday Taco for $2 which was excellent.  Beer selection still good with addition of liquor and wine.  Good place to hangout after work."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and throw back a few pints and meet some nice people. Live music was good the last couple of times I stopped in as well!"}
{"text":"Helles and Dunkel is a very average place in terms of food and atmosphere. It's nice that you get to bring your dog on the patio, but the place has been almost empty both times I have been here (which were both on the weekends). They do have a wide variety of beers on tap. We got the california chicken salad which was average and a pretzel with beer cheese which was very average. Overall, a decent place to stop for a drink before dinner, but not where you want to spend your night out or have dinner."}
{"text":"Great local bar that we visit regularly to hang out with friends. H&D has taken a long time to find their identity after parting ways with the World of Beer franchise, but it feels like they have started to find their rhythm. They still feature a great selection of rotating drafts and bottles,  but also have liquor and a small kitchen now. In addition they have fun events most nights  (rave trivia on Wednesdays being my favorite). Also a big bonus for us is they are dog friendly, which is becoming rare as time goes on. Certainly worth a visit if you are looking for good drinks and a laid back vibe in the south end area."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place twice, the first time was a bar crawl and the second time waiting on a reservation at another restaurant. The first time we arrived late so we were only there for a short period. In that short period, we were greeted immediately by waitress and she tended to our needs. The second time the same waitress greeted and assisted us. It was trivia night, which we wish we could have partaked in the activity but our reservation was ready. As leaving, we encountered a regular of trivia night who gave us the run down on how it works. We were intrigued and definitely plan to attend in the near future. Additionally, I love sushi and we love to try theirs. I believe the waitress name was Amanda. She really knows the concept of customer service and how the the first 5 minutes determines how individuals view their experience."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon to try to place.  When we get there we were told it was a membership club.  We had to sign up for meme era hip for only $1 and then we could  bring in a friend for free.  Really?  Not sure why they are membership.   We joined since we had the Groupon but I don't think they ever collected the $1.  
We did get a pizza, pretzel and tater tots.   Täter tots were good.   Beer selection good.     Great music.  Unfortunately not a lot of people there on a Fri night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came during trivia night and it was so much fun! They just started making sushi in house as well!!! Ahhhhhhhhhh I'm so excited! It was beyond delicious! I definitely reccomend come and try the sushi here! It's great, who would've though!? Sushi with beer? Lmao it was great!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Seems like hundreds of beers, good food. Tonight is live music as well. A perfect neighborhood gathering place"}
{"text":"I went on Saturday, 1/14, the opening weekend of their new menu. My friends and I were so excited to try their menu since it was just redone but I have never been so underwhelmed. 

I have been there is the past and while I haven't had their food, my friends have and they say it was very good. I am a big fan of the wall of beer and that hasn't changed! If I do go back, it will be just for drinks and not for their food.

I understand it was \"opening\" weekend but the service was beyond slow. I was a party of 5, seated at 6 when the place was not terribly busy but it took us over 2 hours to get out of there with a few apps and some wings. We ordered food but had to ask 3 people for silverware and napkins. Our server might just be new, I can get past that, she was very lovely.

The food, however, was just blah. We ordered the chips and queso and the chips came out chewy. They are made out of corn tortilla but were not fried nearly enough. The manager came over and offered to replace or void the transaction, we went with replace. They gave us a new order but the chips were dripping with oil. I wish I could have taken a photo. Also, still not that crisp. Just go with regular chips, no need to \"make your own\" when they won't turn out good. The queso was very good. I got their buffalo chicken bites and it tasted like the buffalo came out of a cheap hot sauce bottle.

Menu suggestion: the avacado fries should come with a dipping sauce and slightly less batter. Try panko!

My friend had a groupon for 2 drinks and 2 meals. No where on the groupon did it say it only was good for the apps and a small ham sandwich. So it didn't cover the pizza, wings or other sandwiches. Incredibly misleading and not worth the price of the groupon.

The menu itself was incredibly boring. Make your own cold sandwich?  And to me, it did not have the atmosphere of sushi. Sure it had interesting rolls but each roll was about $15 and I was in a pub. But that is just my personal taste. 

Overall, I would go back for just the beer but not the food and I hope the service improves drastically."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte about a month ago for work training and being a big beer drinker had to find the best beer bar in south end! Reading about this places' selection pulled us in since it had reminded us so much of a WOB. The bar tender was super awesome, providing quick service but also taking time to tell us about the microbrew history in NC. We had a chance to meet the owner who was great and you could tell how passionate he was about taking his business to the next level. Part of the bar serves as a coffee bar, so grab a quick drink there in the mornings, not to mention the coffee cocktails they have available! Always happy to see small business' thriving. Location seems great, and close by to a parking garage. Southend is lucky to have a place like H&D."}
{"text":"When it was Helles it was amazing. The union sucks.  Service is the worst. I used to come here all the time but after one time with new name I won't be back"}
{"text":"I like this spot a lot. Went here last Friday. The wings were good. I had the Buffalo wings. And I got a cheese pizza. Not a lot of options on the menu so those may be the items you wanna stick with. And of course they have an abundance of beer choices. Cool atmosphere. I'll be going again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Tons of beer on tap, have a good variety of ciders on tap and in bottles. Avocado fries are slices of avocado...fried. Yum! Pro tip park in the deck behind helles for up to 3 hours for free!!! Tons of tvs to watch \"the game,\" and featured live music the Friday I went. Dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"Went today for an event that turned out to be canceled.  Stayed anyway and decided to eat - after trying the wings and a panini, it's clear they probably have a toaster oven that they heat up frozen food from Sam's Club in.  Service was not good or friendly unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out since I've been back home. I remember when it was World of Beer. I got my chance on my birthday weekend. I met a friend there. I'm so glad we got a chance to go. The atmosphere was nice. The bartenders were friendly.

I love the changes they made from what it uses to be. Yes it still have an insane amount of beer to chose from, but now the spirits, wine, and food. No more ordering out and trying to tell the restaurant where you are sitting. 

The food was great. My friend and I had the wings and sweet potatoes fries. I heard the sushi was great. Can't wait to go back and try it. Love the selections of beer and spirits they offer. 

I was there on Sunday and it wasn't crowed. I want to come back for the different events they have going on during the week. I really like the spot and can't wait for my next visit"}
{"text":"Good selection of drinks (lots of beers on tap) and the service is quick but the food and customer service suck. We tried telling the bartender that the fried pickles were WAY too salty and the pretzel was hard served with cold beer cheese and she just said \"okay.\" We were just hoping they would fix it for the next person but clearly customer feedback is not a priority. I'd say this is a place for drinks only."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The beer selection is AMAZING!  The atmosphere is as well AND the service matches! What an amazing place!"}
{"text":"Owner is extremely friendly and personable. My friend and I went in one day before I moved here and when I returned he remembered us! Definitely a warm welcome into the city! It's a great place for pizza, sushi, beer, music, great spot to hang out!"}
{"text":"You guys. 

Helles has sushi now. 

Let that sink in. 

HELLES HAS SUSHI NOW. AND ITS AMAZING. I have come to love this bar. It use to be World of Beer, and is now neighborhood friendly Helles & Dunkel. Wednesday - Saturday they serve off of the special sushi menu and its fresh and fantastic - and reasonably priced. I had the Volcano roll, per Shawn's recommendation. I will be back for this, actually I'm planning a UYE specifically for this because I'm so excited about their new sushi menu. 

They've got games - from pinball to giant jenga, a wall of craft taps (local and nationwide), full bar, plenty of TVs for football, themed nights, dog friendly and now fresh, well made, delicious sushi. Its literally everything that I could ever want in a bar. The staff is warm and friendly, and its always a good time. 

Meet me in Helles."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the best quesadilla I have ever had in my life! Duck quesadilla with blackberry jalapeño cream, red pepper jelly, served with guacamole and sour cream! This thing is the best I have ever had and would make me come back here just for that along but the beer selection is great too! Had a 3 citrus peel out by southern tier to go with the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while walking around South End and I'm glad I did.  The beer selection is huge and the bartender was extremely helpful with finding me something I'd like.  The atmosphere is laid back and dog friendly, and there was a live band that played later on in the night.  Overall a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"If you drove by and thought this was an overpriced gastro pub or franchise.... wrong. It's actually a more neighborhood friendly version of the old World of Beer. I wondered in here on a Thursday to find a huge beer menu, full liquor bar and $2 taco special. It looks like they have a cool game room in the back that would be ideal to grab with a bigger group. Had the tacos and on par, if not better, than any $2 taco special I've had anywhere in South End. If you have the TouchTunes app, open it and put your music on the (better than most bars) sound system. I'll probably be out of here before karaoke starts but definitely on my list to come back sometime for the night life. Yes, there is an annual $1 membership fee but it's no big deal... It's a state law for a bar that has liquor and less than 30% in food sales."}
{"text":"GREATEST NEW FAVORITE SPOT!!! Full bar, games, karaoke, friendly owner drinking with the locals, SUPER cool bartender hooking us up, $2 Jell-O shots, and great menu!!"}
{"text":"It's weird to say there is a bar with awesome sushi, when it's not actually a \"sushi bar\".  Helles and Dunkel may be the only place in Charlotte that fits the bill.  I've been here a few times on both trivia and non-trivia days.  The decor is a pretty standard bar decorations.  Beer signs.  Lots of taps.  Bar stools and tables.  And of course, TVs.  They just recently redid the side room to put in a stage, so should be pretty cool once they start getting in some live music!

The beer selection is pretty extensive.  There are a ton of options from local breweries, and the waiter is more than happy to give you a recommendation/taste.  All the beer I've had there has been good, so you really can't go wrong!

The food is great.  They just recently updated their menu.  Yes, the absolute big winner is the sushi.  It's super fresh and reasonably priced.  Their regular menu has a good variety.  I like that you can \"make your own sandwich\".  Not something you typically see at a bar!  They also have great pretzels with cheese.

Overall, this is a great place to go with your friends after work on a weekday.  Super casual.  Only issue is the parking situation, so good luck finding a spot!"}
{"text":"We started our son's 21st birthday celebration here. I've been flirting with this place's Yelp profile for months. Eager to try the great sushi I was reading about. 
SPOILER ALERT: They no longer have the sushi. 
We entered around 130p and were the only ones in the place. The bartender named Bart was great, eager to please and answer questions about the place. Ally came in to relieve Bart and she was very nice as well. Both Super friendly and helpful. #assets
We enjoyed a few beers and decided to order some food from their small menu. My wife is celiac and we were very pleasantly surprised to see the tiny menu had a Gluten Free pizza. We ordered that, and it was actually delicious. We also order wings. They were very tasty. I usually like mine more on the crispy side, but my family enjoyed them nonetheless. 
I hope this place sticks around. I would like to go back. It worried me that I'm a Saturday afternoon with college football in season, in a popular neighborhood, that a bar was empty. Good luck to Helles and Dunkel."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time visiting Helles & Dunkel and was very impressed by the beer selection, I ended up choosing Epic's IPA, and was not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. My one complaint is that the restroom stall I used didn't have any sort of lock on it. Overall, I was impressed by the bar and will probably go back again."}
{"text":"Last minute Sunday food with some friends. We decided on this spot to watch the panthers preseason game, and grab a bite to eat. 

By visiting this place I found out they have karoke on Sunday's, which is a plus. 

They have a full bar, and lots of drink specials. The bartender was friendly, as so was the staff. 

The food selection is what I was not impressed with, as I do understand that this is a \"Dive\" bar. The menu was limited, so my friend and I shared a cheese pizza. It was 12\" so I was plenty. But they served all their food on paper plates or foam bowls. That the only thing I disliked about this place. I will deff return for karaoke.."}
{"text":"Cool spot, great beers on tap and large 20+ selection, in addition to a full bar.
Bar games for entertainment plus usual TVs on sports.
I will say, only downside is food (options). Sometimes a food truck, sometimes nothing.
Come for the beer and friends, you're fine, if your looking for food and a beer, you've been warned."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Friendly staff. The food has some room for improvement though... We had the pretzels and beer cheese. Slightly above average. Things really went downhill with the wings though. We waited 20+ minutes for them to arrive after ordering and they weren't good -- almost soggy. No crispy-ness or texture whatsoever. In fact, we left several behind. And, they weren't served with any veggies. I missed the staple celery and carrots! 

Parking in this neck o' the woods is a major pain. We lucked out with a street spot. (Free on the weekends and weekdays after 6pm.) They claim dog friendly but I'm not sure how that's possible now that they're serving food. I may test it out and take my pup on a cooler day when we wouldn't mind sitting outside if she's not allowed in. 

All in all, worth another visit. I hope they up their wing game!"}
{"text":"So it is going to be hard for me to write a review and not mention the big pink elephant in the corner known as World of Beer.  The chain pulled out of Charlotte, but it seems out of the ashes came a new place.  Same set-up, but less hassle of conforming to the chain... definitely still a cool place to grab a beer.

I came here the night of the National Championship game.... wanted to avoid the crazy die-hard Duke fans and cheer for Wisconsin in peace.  I chose wisely as it was pretty low key here.  There are still plenty of HD tv's (all were tuned to the game) but I'm sure any other night there are other sports to be watched while drinking your favorite brew.

Since it was a \"slow\" night, it appears there was only one staffer on hand, but he took care of everyone at the bar and on the floor.  Offering us some pretzel bites and a new popcorn machine that you can help yourself to.

Overall it's pretty much the same place, just a new name/management.  Glad there is still a drinking establishment in SouthEnd (that I can selfishly walk to).  Outside food is still welcome.  Bring it on in with you... order delivery or look for a food truck parked outside the location."}
{"text":"I think this used to be Beer World?

Really large space with some pinball and video games and I think a pool table.  

I went in for lunch.  The pizza was ok, but not really.  I don't think they are known for their food, but I'd have to try a few more selections to say for sure.

Plenty of beer selections and for a drinking establishment fairly spot on.  A good place to meet up and have some fun."}
{"text":"Really really bad. On a late Saturday afternoon when everyone was out, we came here based on reviews and it was practically empty. We ordered two beers and a hot pretzel. My beer was undrinkable. It had a really gross taste, like the tap lines haven't been changed in a long time. The pretzel was hard and flavorless, like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. We didn't even finish it, and hurried out of there to go somewhere better. Never going back. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This place was perfect for our group meetup.  The owner bent over backwards to help me make  the meeting a success and everyone had a great time.  The beer selection was excellent.  I love porters and stouts and they had 4 to choose from on draft and some more in bottles.  I ordered the Kickin Chickin Sliders and they were very good.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My man took me to Helles & Dunkel this week for sushi, we have been looking for a good date spot.
 
The food was great!   We had a California Roll, a Philly Roll, and a house special : the Bland Street Roll. The price was good for the very large sushis portions. The ingredients were all fresh and tasty.

The atmosphere was great, some groups of people and some local clicks hanging out. We played  giant Jenga game while the sushi was being prepared.

H&D is now gonna be part of our circuit for date night"}
{"text":"Went to try Helles & Dunkel sushi menu, and it was quite good! I was unsure about the beer + sushi combo, but I was able to successfully pair a lager and a kolsch with the light sushi flavor. They have a really excellent selection of beers, and I will come back another time to just to sample some of their unique options. 

We also participated in their Wednesday night trivia, and I enjoyed it. One of the better trivia nights I've attended, for sure. Good pace, good questions, good vibe.

My only complaint has to be with the service. As far as I could tell, they only had one waitress serving the entire restaurant. I was really appalled and felt bad for her. She was constantly running around trying to keep everyone's drinks and food orders straight. She messed up our orders a couple times/had to be prompted again to bring us items we asked for. I blame the lack of staff though, as she was very sweet and clearly flustered."}
{"text":"As a huge beer fanatic it makes it hard to give this place 3 stars. The beer selection is superb however when it comes to food I was extremely disappointed. Now I understand this is more of a pub eats and beer kind of spot but the \"hot pretzel\" was dried out and seemed old to me. Fried pickles were bland."}
{"text":"Moved to Charlotte from Boston 1 January 2016. Helles was the first local bar that I visited in S. End and I love the place. The beer selection is great, the staff is friendly and welcoming. Great place to catch a game during the week or a band on Friday / Saturday night. The food was pretty new when I first started going there - understand from the staff it is a work in progress - but I have to say it's decent and getting better. I guess they used to have only bags of chips before late last year..."}
{"text":"Came here last night with the puppy, great staff, friendly and knowledgeable.  Not the greatest food selection but that would be my only down fall."}
{"text":"I respect these guys going on their own and branching from the World of Beer franchise. But as much as I enjoy having a pint here, the same issues pop up as when they were part of the franchise. The beers served are head-plus because of either too many lines or the lines being too warm. I really like it here, but I'm afraid casual beer fans won't give it a second try.

This is a good place. They support local beer and the individuals who market outside craft beer in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. The staff was friendly. Almost the same as World of Beer that was there previously.  I believe they have food trucks on different days, mainly weekends I would guess.  I was there on a weeknight, no food truck, but pretty busy."}
{"text":"Nice place for drinks but the food seems like it's all microwaved. Never eating here again but will return for a drink or two :)"}
{"text":"I and a friend went late on a Saturday night. The tvs were all on full blast and you couldn't think in there let alone have any sort of conversation. All we wanted was to have a beer and relax. The drunk Ole Miss group there was crazy obnoxious and some drunk woman insisted on standing right behind me and scream at the tv. We gave her a few looks after she kept stumbling back over after having another swig of her beer. My date and I chose not to engage with the group she was with for fear of it escalating. We chose to leave our beer and left the place. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Formerly WOB but same great service and amazing beer selection. They have cocktails now too but the beer variety is the reason for a visit. If you think you know what you're talking about with beer, this place will humble you.  No food but the large amount of close eateries will hand deliver anything you want. Just ask your server and they'll set you up."}
{"text":"Good beer selection.  Although, just like the previous review stated severely understaffed.  I've been here on two separate occasions same story.  They only have one POS system to update tabs/close out. Trying to be a World of Beer or Flying Saucer on shoe string expenses..."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in H&D while in the area for a drink. After arriving, and paying the $1.00 membership fee we grabbed a few seats at the bar.  The bar was crowded, with a good mix of patrons. The servers were so friendly and definitely seemed to be enjoying their jobs. They allowed us to taste a few beers on tap, before making our selections, which was nice since they did have a good variety.
As the night wet on the crowd grew and the band started.  This night happen to be a reggae band that we enjoyed.  
Helles & Dunkel does offer food, which I will come to check out the menu, is dog friendly, and have a nice patio outside with a few tables for people to enjoy on a nice night!"}
{"text":"We came in with a groupon last night, $14 for two drinks and an entree/apps. There was a few patrons for karaoke night (someone did a mean version of No Diggity) but, it was mostly empty. Music was good. The bartenders are very nice and attentive. I docked a star for the $1 membership, I don't believe in those period. Drafts are priced well and had a good variety going. 

The food on the other hand is not as great. We ordered two pretzels with a side of beer cheese.. We only could finish one if that says anything. The food was very clearly \"nuked\" in the microwave, the pretzel was out of this world dry and the beer cheese was unappetizingly separating within its components. The honey mustard that comes with pretzels was actually good. If you go through the reviews, a yelper explains that there is no grill, only microwave or oven... Should have caught that earlier on. 

Bottom line, just come here for drinks and drink specials. Do not order the food. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had never visited The Union before it was known as The Union. All I know is that this spot is freaking amazing! It's clean, not too big/not too small, fun and friendly crew members, lots of entertainment to choose from, trivia night, drink specials, Keno, lots of TVs, and the list goes on! Just this past trivia night, the sweet owners of the food truck (can't think of the name right now) accommodated my strict diet and prepared veggie burgers and some other veggie treats ;) . I honestly think that if you experience The Union and don't genuinely vibe , then maybe it's YOU and not The U! Check them out!!!!"}
