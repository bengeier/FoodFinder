{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! Shattered chips are delicious, we took our leftovers of them home and added buffalo sauce and they were even better! The chef came outside and asked how our meal was and the manager also stopped by. You never see this at smaller restaurants so that was a great perk! WE had the Paris Texas Burger and the chicken sandwich, both amazing! Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing good food... I had the Ingos Burger Adam and Eve style(no bread or condiments) AMAZEBALLS!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food! Cool round building with plenty of outdoor patio spots. It was a bit chill out that afternoon so they turned on the outdoor warmers and it was cozy. Ordered the grass fed Paris burger and it did not disappoint. It was juicy and flavorful with bbq sauce and pickles. Don't pass up the chips. Just the way my mom would make them, thinly slice  up the potato into circles and fry them up nice and crispy. The two sauces that came with the chips were splendid. One order is plenty for two people. Two people $30 for burgers chips and drinks. I will defiantly be back and recommend it if you just want a chill place to relax and grab some good food!!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience,  my boyfriend and I had no plan as to where we going to eat after dropping his daughter off atvthe high school football game. We  drove around and didn't want to eat at our regular haunts, low and behold a light bulb illuminated let's drive downtown.  The first place I pulled up was closed and decided let's go to LGO... So we did, now mind you we weren't dressed to really go out, so the manfriend said lets go across the street that looks more casual.    Great call the Avocado Toast is a must have and the watermelon salad yumulance."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food, great ambiance, and awesome service! You won't want for anything here, as they keep your glass above half full all the time.   Most of the food is locally sourced, which earns them the 5th star. And they have THE BEST BURGER I've had in my life."}
{"text":"I was here about a year and a half ago and was blown away by the ambiance and amazing service we recieved. We are back in town and immediately had to come back. We had the Ingo's cheeseburger, it was delicious. The shattered potato chips were fantastic and the jalapeño sauce was very flavorful. The service was spectacular! They were very nice, welcoming and attentive. We had a few drinks which were also amazing."}
{"text":"This place is sooo great! Lovely patio area, the staff is awesome and very friendly, and the fooood! The food is amazing and so are their drinks! They have great items on the menu. You can tell everything tastes fresh. Definitely recommend this place and it's also a great location to ride your bike to!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Farmers daughter burger and deviled eggs are to die for! Great atmosphere and pet friendly patio is very nice!"}
{"text":"Ingo's was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say I am now in love! The Kale and  quinoa salad with crispy chicken is absolutely amazing! The cracked potato chips with the salsa are out of this world. Ingo's is defiantly a newly acquired obsession of mine that I plan on keeping for a long time!"}
{"text":"There is an \"executive chef\" of Ingo's who comes by once in a while (he's got a unique hairstyle, so that's how you'll notice him.) Our main complaint with him is although he doesn't ever actually make the food, once it's set out for the waitresses to grab and serve it, he'll randomly come by and just touch the food for no reason. It's very bizarre. He basically just walks by and \"taps\" your burger buns like he's hitting bongo drums. That might be just a weird little tic that one could overlook if his hands were clean. Unfortunately my party and I once watched him take out the trash, then, without washing his hands, walk right over and start doing his \"burger bun tapping.\" If you don't have to touch the food, don't touch the food. And if you're going to touch the food for no reason, please wash your hands before you do it.  That being said, I personally love the Farmer's Daughter burger. That with a individually brewed ice tea really is great on a hot day. It's a fun little spot and if you don't mind sitting at the counter with you friends, it can be great for a quick lunch.  I'm excited for the fall when sitting outside on the patio won't be horrible and then the seating will effectively more than double. I come here probably one a week for a bite, and hope you'll check it out."}
{"text":"Tiny but awesome casual place with burgers (grass fed beef!), sandwiches, and the most amazing hummus and pumpkin seed dips (yes really) with crudités.  You should also look at the the Post-It Note special (which changes weekly). Don't forget the (free!) French-sea-salt cookies on the way out, either.  You can either sit outside, or inside at the bar in a tiny, modern, almost-hipster-but-not-in-that-annoying-way round building (bathrooms are out back). Service at the bar was *great* and super friendly (free samples were offered of the hummus/pumpkin seed dips for example; also got told about the gelato sandwiches). They have a small menu of beer and wine.   Only drawbacks; portions are smallish (burgers/sandwiches are stand alone so order sides if you're hungry) and prices are reasonablish but not cheap. That said, def making a return trip here next time we home Camelback."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour!!  The steak salad is awesome!  With a nice sized portion of salad with cooked to order steak that has goat cheese and sunflower seeds.   My wife had the crispy chicken sammy and I have had that prior and it is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had!  My wife agrees!  It's located in the Arcadia area and is has a good patio.  The only thing that is missing is a water feature to drown out the local road noise.  They have limited number of craft beers but they are very tasty and the mimosa is good as well.  A great addition to the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Ok...the food was fresh and tasty but the portions are super small for the price. We were very disappointed in not only the size of the burger but the kale salad too."}
{"text":"Ingo's is a pretty cool place.  The atmosphere is great and the service is friendly and the food comes quickly.  My chicken sandwich was great (but a bit on the small side) and my girlfriend's veggie burger was absolutely amazing.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the chips- they were smashed into small pieces that made it difficult to enjoy the dipping sauces that came with it.  Otherwise an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Wow, delicious food for such great prices! We were so happy that we found this place. We got the hummus and pumpkin seed dip, the kale salad, and the cheeseburger, and we loved it all! The place has a great set up, and everything came out quickly. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. Food is always on point, but service is a shot in the dark so you never know what you are going to get! They do shared servers so it can be confusing who you're person is and sometimes the ball gets dropped unfortunately.   Food is so good though! Must orders are: Crispy Chicken Sammy, Paris Texas Burger, Shattered chips, Kale & Quinoa salad with crispy chicken on top, and the Post-it note special salad (which is now a regular yay!) Orange and Fennel salad. For drinks, must have the Greyhound, MUST!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and suggested multiple dishes and options that I'll be trying real soon.   For starters, the shattered potatoes are better than any fries I've ever had. Dipped in that jalapeño sauce, so good.  Also you can add a fried egg to any burger, and they offer fresh English muffins as an alternative bun, she suggested going this route with the standard cheeseburger.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich came very highly recommended, a staff favorite. It had a golden brown crust and it looked friggin amazing.   Lots of people were ordering the kale salad, and it looked, well, it looked like a kale salad to be honest. Probably pretty bomb considering the frequency it was being ordered though.  The tuna sandwich was going out as much as the salads were, which I found a bit odd, but she said their Egg Salad Sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in the valley, and it's only sold for one hour a day...hot damn.  I had the Paris, Texas Burger. It was...wow...  The beef was unbelievably savory, cooked medium rare with incredible mouthfeel, juicy but not at all greasy. Pancetta was salty and perfectly crispy, bacon's better brother. Sharp cheddar cheese blanketed the beef, holding it all together and melding the flavors into umami heaven. The apple butter BBQ sauce is otherworldly, sweet but with this slight smoky flavor that just rounds it all out. The dill pickles chips gave a fresh & light crispness to each bite, and the fresh poppyseed buns were baked to perfection culminating in this amazing amalgamation of tastes and textures. A new flavor took center stage with each chew, and I must have made the family that sat next to us really uncomfortable with all the moaning and grunting I was making as I ate.   The waitress also gave us a little dish of their lacto-fermented jalapeño hot sauce and it took the flavors to another level.  Spicy-sweet-salty-savory-juicy-crisp-chewy-melty-glory."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner on the patio. It was our first time...won't be last.  The homemade chips w some dipping sauce were out of this world. Split their special cheese burger( can't remember name) but it was also incredible and chicken salad with friend. Chicken salad was really tasty. Kind of shredded chicken with grapes and some celery and raisins and mayo. Yum! Had an old fashioned quality taste. Loved the sangria too!  Along with the food being great, the staff was not snobby but extra friendly and did I mention really nice patio?  On the way out, I complimented one of our servers and he introduced himself...Richie!  Great send off loved the place!"}
{"text":"Great menu, dog -friendly, awesome service.  My favorite is the chicken Sammy. Free cookies , extra parking down the street . One of the best in Arcadia."}
{"text":"I love this place. i just moved to Arcadia 3 months ago, and try and eat here at least once week. I love the outside patio, food is good, i just wish they has a few more items on the menu to chose from. I love coming here but don't want to get burnt out on food options. Great atmosphere and always a super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this place to open. Great patio with plenty of heaters for a perfect winter evening. Casual and fun place to grab a burger and a beer (or wine). We enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich on a LGO English muffin and the burger with the homemade sauerkraut. Burger was tasty  & cooked perfectly. I'm not a big kraut fan but really enjoyed it. Chicken sandwich had a nice kick and I liked the addition of the Granny Smith apple. We also had an order of the homemade chips. This is going to be a great addition to 40/Camelback area."}
{"text":"Great burger place in the Arcadia neighborhood. My second favorite burger place that I've been to in az. Good quality meat is what really makes their food."}
{"text":"5 star food, drink and service! Omg, Paris, Texas Burger, OMG. No. 1 Tuna, Berry tea, alcohol selection also tasty.  Less clustery feeling than LGO and Postino. Order at window and then full service outside, or just head inside for full service from start.  Full disclosure: baby belly? Seats inside are fixed position to bar and rather snug. Plenty of room and heat outside! Minus 1 star for the company's ever present parking issue. Don't try to valet at LGO/Postino. The valet service doesn't allow (but should) and isn't polite about it. However, the very attentive, amazing staff at Ingo's makes up for valet. Apparently, there is extra parking just north of building on 40th St too!"}
{"text":"So, I tried the White Fish Club Sandwich and Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. All ordered ahead and brought to the car curbside.  Atmosphere (4): While small inside, I definitely appreciate the ability for drive-up service when you call ahead. There are also a few tables outside to enjoy your food. My only issue is the limited parking. Whether you are eating onsite or taking out, the parking is limited in their lot. I believe you can park across the street at a sister property (LaGrande Orange I believe).  Food (4): The fish sandwich was different than any other I've had in that it wasn't cod or some other pieced together fish. It was flaky and the crust was crispy and well seasoned. I opted for both the lebni AND Ingo's hot sauce, which I dipped my chips in both and it was damn good. I even poured some of the Ingo's hot sauce on my fish sandwich for some extra added flavor (excellent choice). I was expecting a little more flavor to the chips. I did not taste any sea salt or pepper (there was plenty of green shrubbery though).   Service (4): I used drive-up service, not realizing that they would come to the car. After hopping out and heading to the window to pick-up my order, the server told me that they would kindly bring my order to my car. (SCORE!)  Price (4): Prices were fair, $13.25 (plus tax) for a fish sandwich and chips (or fries, whatever you want to call them). The amount of food provided left me full and satisfied.   Overall, I would frequent Ingo's, especially for the fish sandwich. They have quite a few delicious looking items on their menu and they don't have too much so, it's not hard to find a selection. Next time I'll try their deviled eggs (who doesn't love a good deviled egg).  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything was really cool, as to be expected with this new lgo concept. Potato chips were exceptional! Bbq burger was to rich. Maybe there was too much sauce that took away from the high quality beef. The cheddar on the cheeseburger is to die for very sharp and stands up to the burger. Poppyseed bun was a nice touch but toasted sesame would compliment the sandwich better. IMO"}
{"text":"This place is a well oiled machine!! Amazing service and teamwork from every employee!  Not to mention the food is delicious!!!  My husband and I come here every Sunday for brunch.  Don't forget to sample the free cookies!!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place right now! Ingo Cheeseburger (grass-fed BTW) , Shattered potatoes & COLD beer....what else do you need? Hubby has had the chicken burger thingie, the Paris burger and we've shared the kale salad. All delicious! Love the atmosphere, music & the patio. The free cookies for dessert are a fun bonus."}
{"text":"We read the review in the Phoenix Magazine and knew that we had to give Ingo's a try. That was about 8 weeks ago now. We have returned at least a dozen times to taste new items and reorder our favorites. Instead of going through each item on the menu, suffice to say that everything is tasty and really good. What is most amazing in this rather small and interesting place is how they consistently maintain their high quality. I have never seen that in any other restaurant and we eat out most of our meals.   This is a friendly and comfortable place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is terrible at Ingo's.I would NOT recommend this place.The kitchen was very unsanitary.The waitresses were unhelpful when asked if I could get something else.The building is cool and unique,but that's the best I can say about this place.Add to that,the parking is very limited.Do not eat at here!!"}
{"text":"Great option. Sat outside and had a bit of a view of mtns up 40th street. The shredded chips (their version of fries) were great, couldn't stop eating them. Paris TX burger was interesting, a little sweet for my taste, but a noble effort. Kale and quinoa salad and lemonade were fine, but nothing special. All in all, a great place to side outside and enjoy a quite tasty causal meal.  Better than LGO IMO."}
{"text":"We got the chicken burger, the Paris burger and fries.  So yummy and fast!  The seasonal dink was a pomegranate margarita $6.  So cold it gave me a brain freeze.  Don't forget to get your complimentary cookies."}
{"text":"Ok- I am sooooo pleased with Ingo's! And so full lol !  The shattered potatoes shattered my diet and so did the tasty greyhound. The veggie burger is one of the best I ever had. Service was friendly and attentive. Great location- I really liked the outdoor seating. BTW- there are free chocolate chip cookies inside :). Love it."}
{"text":"The signage for this restaurant is minimal, but you can't miss the cute little round building on the corner lot with outside seating. Even at 3pm, the place had quite a few patrons and was gearing up for a busy evening. We had an exceptional waitress and also spoke with the manager who was also quite friendly. Our waitress actually comped an order of deviled eggs and shattered potatoes (of which they are know for).  We ordered the deviled eggs and Texas Paris burger. Being a southern girl, I like to think that I know deviled eggs. While I appreciate their creativity with the eggs, I thought the goat cheese was a little too strong (reasoning for a four). If you are a fan of mustard, goat cheese, and dill then these are for you. If not, then steer away.  The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, flavorful, and appropriately sized. I'm a sucker for bbq sauce on burgers.   Like I said, we didn't order the potatoes but I would recommend them. They are topped with a refreshing yogurt sauce and served with fermented jalapeño sauce on the side. It might sound a little gross to some, but that green sauce is dynamite!  And last, but not least the cookies are free (if I had a microphone I would drop it)!"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Good service. They have a really nice outdoor patio. The shattered potatoes were delicious! I ordered the Rice bowl... I am going to be dreaming about that dish for weeks... So good!"}
{"text":"The tuna burger is a top 5 sandwich in the valley. I also need the recipe for dip for the potatoes. Great place for a late lunch (to avoid the LGO rush)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and the food was great. In addition, the service was very good and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Love the feel of the place too!"}
{"text":"After my first visit and review, I promptly received a kind email from someone at Ingo's asking me to come back for a free meal and try their food again. It was a very kind gesture and after several months I made it back.  Once again this place has a killer atmosphere and extremely attentive and great waitstaff. Everything we ordered came out quick and tasty.   For an appetizer, I got their Deviled Eggs which had a rich and flavorful filling that is a step above most other deviled eggs. Next, I had the Chicken Sammy Sandwich which has an extremely awesome balance between the crispiness from the chicken, crunch from the granny smith apple, and added flavor complexity from the pickle and spicy aioli. It is truly a unique sandwich and unlike any other chicken sandwich I've had before.  So to circle back on my prior review, I do retract telling people to go to Hopdoddy's for a better burger. The Chicken Sammy, Post-It note salad, and Deviled Eggs were all delicious and live up to Ingo's \"Tasty Food\" motto. Perhaps from my first visit, the Ingo Cheeseburger just wasn't for me.   So why not a 5 star rating...because I'm still a little hungry. I know there are some places where you get way too much food and I respect the fact that Ingo's relies more on taste than quantity; however, with food so tasty I want my belly just a little bit fuller."}
{"text":"Everything is done tableside which is nice. However I had to repeat my order to the server 3 times and she still didn't remember my drink. We were explained that burgers are served with a pink medium. After asking for it med.rare I received it med.well. no pink. The other burger at our table was the same. Med rare and was served med.well+. Decent flavor. Ok price. Left expecting more from the burgers."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich and the love child are incredible.  Atmosphere is a 10 out of 10!!"}
{"text":"Really love Ingo's. Been a fan and loyal customer since 1997. The atmosphere and food are excellent but so are many establishments in the same area. The thing that sets Ingos's apart from the rest is the high quality service. Troy greets you with a smile and friendly banter every time. Some days I'm not even hungry but need a pick me up and Troy offers just that! High recommended to anyone looking for a fun and flavorful time! I give Ingo's 5 dragon warriors out of 5!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably half a dozen times at least and everytime I fall in love with it all over again! Definitely one of the best burgers in Phoenix for sure! The service is always great and the restaurant is always well kept and clean.     You know its good food when you have a hard time deciding what to eat because everything on the menu makes your mouth water! Can I just order one of everything please?!"}
{"text":"Great menu. Great staff. A winning combination. The salty chocolate chip cookies finish the meals nicely. Kale and quinoa salad is the best. Burgers (made with meat or beans) are fantastic. Got to get the fresh made chips every time."}
{"text":"Best burgers and small outside patio in Phoenix . The waitstaff is always super friendly and well trained. Can get a little crowed on a fall or winter weekended night , but definitely worth the wait. I would recommend having a wider variety of draft beer otherwise they have it spot on . Even free cookies for the Kids after meal ."}
{"text":"I love this pleasant little place. It's small and round...Circular vibes. When you feel like having a pitcher of greyhounds for lunch, and an endless supply of cookies, well, this here is your jam.   The greyhounds (also, sangria never fails) are so good you will actually return after leaving the first time, for a second pitcher...which, if we want to get mathematical , means you'll be hungover for 3 days.  (Cookies + greyhounds / watermelon salad + basket of chip fries^2 = best day of your life - major hangover)  [order of operations.]   I've always had great service here; Richie always kills it, and that crispy chicken sandwich is divine.  (So is the watermelon salad, but you should probably get there soon to experience that before it's out of season.)  these are my people. Cheers to my people."}
{"text":"Delish!!  Wisconsin beef - check Wisconsin cheese - check Sauerkraut - check  This Wisconsin girl is in heaven!   Great food and service. The menu is limited but everything seems executed very well. We will be back to try the crispy chicken sandwich. You had me at Sircha aioli.   My Ingo burger didn't stay on my plate long enough for a picture so I'm posting a picture of the Paris, Texas burger.  Thanks team INGO"}
{"text":"On a positive note, grass fed beef is a plus. However for what you get, the burgers are overpriced and NO FRIES!!! Big mistake in my book regardless of the chips you can get a la carte. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tried the chips, Paris Texas burger and the orange and fennel salad. All were great. The salad was so good we will try to recreate back at home.  Outdoor seating available with misters and the place is very dog friendly. Fun and yes, tasty place!"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't even want to write a review on how great this place is because I didn't want people knowing how great my neighborhood spot is. It's got an amazing location with an environment that makes you feel like you're at the beach, minus those douchebag seagulls and screaming kids. Oh yeah, the food is incredible too"}
{"text":"Visited there last week with another couple and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My boyfriend and I each had a burger and shared the kale salad and shattered chips. All of the food was awesome - the other couple we went with had the same reaction. The executive chef, Dom, came out to check on the food and introduce himself to us which was a nice touch. I love the architecture of the place...they managed to do a great job with such a small lot. I will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"This place is not for the average and ordinary taste bud. But for those that would like to enjoy a gourmet diner experience.  I truly LOVE this place the food is amazing and the best burgers ever!!! My favorites are the Farmer's Daughter burger, kale salad w/ the chicken breast, hummus and veggies and now the kale salad with the vegetarian burger not to mention the shattered potatoes. The flavors...YUM YUM!!!  There are very few restaurants in the valley that care about giving their customers the highest quality ingredients like Ingo's i.e. grass fed/finished meats, free range chicken, local farm veggies and fresh baked bread.   Most of all the staff always greet us like family. It's like living out a Norm at Cheer's tradition because although the food is top notch the staff from the MANAGERS to the SERVERS create a complete foodie experience for me and my husband. It is a very fine balance to engage and give patrons their space and they do it so well.   Our thanks to the ENTIRE INGO'S TASTY FAMILY! Our favorite anytime restaurant in the valley!!! We highly recommend going!!!"}
{"text":"Late afternoon Sunday Companion and I had different desires.  She wanted a Red Bull and a pack of Marlboro Lights.  I wanted a cheese burger. We went into Ingo's , which I thought was a combination of a \"Stop & Go\" convenience store and \"In & Out\" Burgers.   We were greeted by a blonde Jasmine or Jessica or some other \"J\" name who is a testament as to why skinny jeans were invented.  Shunning the outdoor patio area due to chill, we sauntered inside to the close quarters of a horseshoe bar/counter.  The bar had a close full view of the kitchen staff and those who get squeamish at the sight of tattoos and stretching earrings, sit outside. An interesting \"waiting area\" are painted numbered footprints on the floor, which reminded me of the lineup I stood in at the County Jail.  But I digress, onto the food.  Quality craft beers are served cold and in clear plastic solo cups.  (Disappointing they were not in the vintage Red Solo Cup to preserve my youth and bring back the \"Keg Party\" feel\".  If Management adopts the color, thank me.)  This is a burger place and it is aptly described as such.  The classic cheeseburger was a brilliant in its simplicity and served on a quality white bun (thank you for shunning the over used pretzel bun).  The violently named \"Fresh Shattered Potato Chips\" were a perfect compliment and remained hot during the meal.  Adjourning to the patio for an apres-beer, Companion walked up the block to retrieve her cigarettes.  Ingo's closes at 9, so I was asked to leave.  If you see Companion, please tell her she owes me for dinner.  I will gladly meet her at Ingo's."}
{"text":"Ingo's had a fresh and creative menu with a nice outdoor dining space.  There were several tasty craft beers to choose from.  AND its pet friendly!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to enjoy a delicious meal without feeling guilty of breaking healthy habits Ingo's is The place. Best quality, probably the best service in town, well balanced portions of fresh ingredients cooked to perfection where every bite is an experience. I'm extremely picky when comes to healthy food and don't like fast food but Ingo's is like home cooking.  They deserve more then 5 stars. Highly recommend to try it. Can't go wrong with any choice from the menu."}
{"text":"This place was just OK. I got a burger here and it was just average to me. It was a little overcooked and the flavor wasn't all what I was expecting for the price. The service was decent and the place was clean, but just an average meal in my opinion. I will have to come here again as it could have just been an off day."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  Outstanding Grass fed burgers,  the veggies with hummus and this spicy pumpkin seed dip was delicious  if you eat the raw red bell peppers with the pumpkin seed dip,  it's a taste explosion of yum! Great experience,  great staff,  will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for a burger in Phoenix. I always get the Ingo's burger, the chips, and a greyhound and it's consistently amazing."}
{"text":"You don't need to have a long menu or complex food to give people a good meal and experience. My fiancée and I shared a kale salad, cheeseburger and shattered potato chips and loved every bite. Simple food executed well. Their sangria is to die for and while they only have three beers on the menu they were good choices. Our waitress Erin was awesome! Friendly, quick and helpful. I'm glad this place is in biking distance so we can go frequently. I plan on going enough to everyone knows my name. Another great place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Every time I go I have to get the burger. I live in walking distance of this place and I go as often as I can. Not to great for summer time due to the outdoor seating but besides that the food is well worth the heat."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since I drive by all the time. They've got an awesome patio to hang out on with misters to keep you cool. The chicken Sammy is where it's at! Oh and don't forget the potato chips!  Service was perfect - attentive but not overbearing. Fun new spot I'll be frequenting."}
{"text":"Food: the burger us really good. The only reason I am downgrading it is because I ordered medium, and it came out a very rare medium rare. I had higher expectations because of its connection to LGO, and it's a burger place.   The lemonade was extremely tart for my liking (and the three others at my table). I added a lot of water to calm it down.   The concept is cool, but I think it needs a little more work to get it right. I will return, at least because happy hour sounds like fun: 11-6pm or something, Tues-Fri is $3 beer, cocktails and sangria!"}
{"text":"I've been to this adorable spot twice now. And it's enough to know that I'm in love. I've had their regular cheeseburger, tuna burger, and two of their \"post it\" salads. Every bite of all of it was exceptional. The salads I had were super fresh and the service staff was all smiles. I also tried their cold brewed green tea tonight. Yummm. I got to watch an amazing sunset from their awesome patio in the perfect weather. I'm not sure how long this place has been open, but they are off to a fantastic start for me.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  I had the brown rice bowl which was spicy and the perfect amount of food for a small lunch. The other girls I was with had the chicken sandwich (to die for) and the burger. When I go back I'll definitely be having the chicken sandwich. Simply amazing.  Great music, good people watching, all around great little spot to stop at in Arcadia."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich is awesome, and the burgers are great too! It's a small place but the food is worth it! The service varies, that's my only concern. Our last experience we felt a bother to this girl. She didn't bother to refill our drinks or give us anything extra we wanted, and she left for the day, without a word. Another girl took over and was very nice and got what we needed, I appreciated that. Once again, food is great, service varies!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place to go now that the weather is perfect!!! I lunch and sitting on the patio!  My fave is Courtney!  She is the most pleasant person on earth!!!!  She always has a menu suggestion and is spot on."}
{"text":"I went back and had a good time.  The food was delicious as it was the first time. the ambiance was much better and the service was very good. thank you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so excited to get some take out from Ingo's. We parked at the curbside to go area and then got out, stood at the take out window for a while, and no one acknowledged us at all. Not even a \"hey guys be right with you!\" This was yesterday on a slow Monday lunch. Got tired of waiting and left. Step up your service game Ingo's. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"I just really like ingos. They have strong burgers made with killer ingredients, great sides and good beer, wine and sangria. We live pretty close and have been to LGO billions of times, but have started to frequent ingos for it's lower-key environment and simplicity. My favorite side to get is the potato crisps with that amazing dip - definitely worth adding to your meal. If you're not into beef, my favorite is the tuna burger. It's nice and spicy but not overwhelming, and the tuna doesn't get lost in the sauce. The blush sangria is on point, too!"}
{"text":"This is another great restaurant by LGO.  It is dog friendly which is a big thing in Arcadia.  They gave our dog a bowl of water and a treat! Now to the food...I had the Paris, Texas burger and it was delicious!  There were a lot of things on the burger that I would normally hold but all of the flavors worked really well together.  The buns are delicious since they come from the LGO bakery and the other ingredients tasted fresh.  We will definitely be coming back to enjoy the HH and I will try the shattered chips next time as I heard they were good.  They also have \"Post-It Note\" specials everyday which is a cool idea."}
{"text":"Always great! Paris Texas and chips is my go-to. Really anything on the menu is wonderful and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"It was good....... Nothing special though....... I dislike pimple faced kids driving my car, so parking sucks if you don't valet.. Again, nothing special, food was fine......"}
{"text":"I work in Arcadia and my boss loves to try all the different restaurants. We stopped by Ingo for happy hour on a Friday after work and loved it!   This restaurant has an awesome vibe and offers unique bar seating inside along with lots of outdoor seating. There isn't too much room in the building, but they have made excellent use of the space and done a great job decorating.  The employees were awesome! Definitely one of Ingo's main assets. They were so friendly and provided fast service. We ordered from our table outside and she was able to swipe the credit card right there on a mobile device.  They mostly offer burgers with a slight twist on the toppings. There weren't too many options to order, but like in and out, sometimes less is more. I can't eat wheat so I had to settle for a piece of meat with cheese on it, but that's the case at many restaurants so I'm used to it. There is definitely a market for gluten free food, so maybe they should consider offering some.  Their (only) appetizer was home made potato chips, but they were amazing and I would order them every time.  We ordered bottles of wine and drank from cheap plastic dixie cups. This is the only area I could see them improving on.   This place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite, with a small but delicious menu served quickly at the counter or taken to go.  The deviled eggs are really good!  My only complaint would be the music, which can get loud and isn't always what I'd like to be listening to.  Free salted chocolate chip cookies are always appreciated, though they are a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Best secret burger spot in Baltimore/Arcadia. The menu is small, but everything is delicious. The Potato Chips with Jalapeno Sauce are addicting, 1 order can be shared, but you'll want 2. The Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich is the best Chix Sammie in the Valley - I get it Paris style - BBQ and Bacon. The staff is friendly and the turnaround is quick. Please bring back the Chicken and Waffles..."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight and was less then impressed. The cheeseburger was a major disappointment and the service was slow. I would give it a single star; however, I am impressed with what they were able to build on such a small lot. The atmosphere was decent as well. It is a plus that they use all plastic ad metal cups and plates so a todler can't break anything."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here yesterday and am very happy we did. The service was excellent and the food was even better. Had the steak salad and a cheeseburger and I can not wait to go back to try something else! Very laid back environment, great for a casual lunch or dinner.  Plenty of parking right on site which I appreciated in the 100+ tempreture."}
{"text":"Ingo's has been wonderful both times I have been. My friend asked me to join him one evening and I bicycled up. It was very good. We had attentive service and the food was very good.  This afternoon, my husband and I stopped for a burger and some wine. It was excellent. The food was delicious. The service was done with smiles for us. We were sitting outside enjoying our Phoenix 108 temps. with misters. It was delightful. There is no pressure to hurry up and get out. The ambience is that of a Parisian cafe and I can give you no higher praise than that.  Thank you for allowing us to really enjoy what w came for - good d food, good wine, and some relaxation.  Monday comes all too soon!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice.  The first time I had the watermelon salad - it was very good if a little peppery (black pepper) and small for the price.  The volume of the music along with the open kitchen setting made for a loud environment.  This last time I had the Ingo Cheeseburger and we shared the shattered potato chips.  The potato chips were thick and quite good with a crunchy border and soft middle.  The dipping sauce was okay.  The cheeseburger though was very oily - I assume from the mayonnaise.  It was so oily it coated the inside of my mouth and overwhelmed the burger in general.  The meat of the burger was so soft it was almost like eating mashed potatoes.  Between that and the oil,  it was unlike any burger I've had and I did not enjoy it.  It's my understanding that this restaurant is run by the same folks who operate chelsea's kitchen.  I love their hamburgers so this was a big dissapointment."}
{"text":"I like this place! The tuna burger is muy bueno!! The hummus is good too and looks cute the way they serve it, but is hard to eat out of the little jars. Simple, but good drink menu as well :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The burgers are the best in the ey by far and the crispy chicken is unreal. On top of that they make a RIPPIN greyhound."}
{"text":"I typically write fairly in depth reviews but not much needs to be said here. I've eaten a LOT of burgers and this place has the best burger hands down. Seating outside is nice. The only downside I can see is when it's really hot out you can't sit outside   The service has always been friendly and prompt.   Bottom line, if you're in the mood for a burger you'd better get yourself on over to Ingo's."}
{"text":"We go here all the time and are neighborhood locals but typically everything has been so inconsistent.... The shattered chips are rarely ever cooked and we get our order home only to discover things aren't cooked all the way. Pretty disappointed since I drive by here to get home."}
{"text":"Went there today.  Sat for 10 minutes, and nobody would help me.      I eventually left frustrated.  I heard the burger is great, but I can't cook it up and serve it to myself..."}
{"text":"Coolest eats in Arcadia.. Excellent and brief menu.. Fantastic Ahi, Dee-Lish burgers.. of note Ingo burger topped with Kool kraut.. Umm, Yum! And the chips kick Ass! U slide nicely onto the groovy orange bar stool, to the best service. Very chic and urban.. Great concept with taste, service and palate. Beers and wine fit perfectly with menu.. Can't wait to show up in the warm months on the cruiser! Viva Ingo!"}
{"text":"This is a hipster/casual place to grab a quick bite to eat. I really like the option to eat in or taking food to go.  I like that they offer a variety of food choices with healthy options too. There is outside seating and bar seating inside where you can sit and watch the chefs and staff go to work! I've always enjoyed being able to be a part of the action and see what goes in to making the wonderful dishes before they're served to customers. I have been here 4 times and thought it was time to write a well thought out review. I can't get enough of the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips, the Ingo Burger, and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich that has the perfect amount of spice to it. Overall, the food and service is great for anyone to enjoy in a casual relaxed environment.  I honestly would've given this place a 4+ star rating if it weren't for my MAJOR concern listed below.  My one and only MAJOR concern that has been consistent all 4 times I have eating here is that the executive chef who checks the food before it goes out repeatedly failed to wear gloves to avoid cross contamination. I watched him poke and touch customer's food with his bare hands then text on his phone, make phone calls on his cell phone, and type on his computer repeatedly each time I have eaten here. Not once did I witness him leave to wash his hands. I was VERY lucky that he didn't poke my burger any of the times I was sitting there watching him in disbelief, otherwise I would've sent it back immediately! Maybe he didn't because he knew it was my food and I was watching him, but either way it completely grossed me out!"}
{"text":"Paris Texas burger with sauteed onions, so good. One of my favorite burgers in the valley."}
{"text":"Had to revise my review from 4 stars to 3 since our second visit was a 2 at best.  Took forever to get food.  Order was incorrect.  Burgers over cooked.  They did offer coupon for next time.  Lot a great burger places in town so not sure there will be a next time."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot in Phoenix!  We've been visiting LGO for awhile now so we were excited to try Ingo's when we heard about it.  It did not disappoint!  The burger is perfection, and I am pretty picky about my burgers. The cracked chips and yogurt sauce are awesome as well. I've also had the heirloom rice bowl, the kale and quinoa salad, and the tuna burger.. All of which were great.  I can't wait to return for the egg salad at some point, though it'll be tough to stray from the burger. Their patio is dog friendly too! I LOVE that they have Scrimshaw on draft, and the happy hour prices are great. My only wish is that they had a larger beer selection to choose from."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, and mostly go to LGO, but I had to try this place! I am so glad I did, and I have brought so many friends and family members, who loved the food as much as I do!! The fish is so fresh and you can taste the quality of the food in every dish. The staff is always great too."}
{"text":"Best relaxing patio vibe with sun and shade, and dog friendly...can do groups of 6 but seating is limited. Service was amazing!! And well staffed, they were fun food was delicious and it's my new favorite day time brunch/lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Ingo's since it opened, still one of my fav's ....but I have 1 complaint and 1 suggestion as a loyal loving customer.   I was there yesterday and I had the \"new\" Avocado toast.... why?? Why would you change such a perfect dish?!?! :(  I loved your old version. It was soooo good. I am not feeling the dates at all. I just don't get it. I would actually never order again now. Please consider changing it back. I beg you....   My suggestion is that you bring back the rice bowl for the winter! I loved that dish.   Anyway... everything is still fabulous. I love the chips, salad, burgers, chic sand, and the new egg troubadour sandwich :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, great eat up bar and patio. Beautiful burgers and chicken sandwiches. Love the deviled eggs"}
{"text":"First, the star-reducing factors: Somewhat high prices and extremely tiny parking lot, but those factors are to be expected with an LGO restaurant I suppose!  Make use of their \"secret parking\" by their corporate office a couple minutes walk down the street, past the (chained up!) dermatologist office and dry cleaners.  I also find the servers here to not be as personable as they could be, and they spent time talking amongst each other instead of checking up on customers and filling empty drink glasses.  I've also had a waitress \"forget\" to take my mother's order!  Unfortunately, I think they have been hired based on looks and not on experience.  Star-bestowing factor: FOOD!  I've tried the amazingly delicious Paris, Texas burger and the chicken schnitzel sandwich.  The burger was fantastic, especially on an English muffin and with an egg on top.  The breading came off of the chicken when I had that, though it was still tasty.  Definitely not \"amazing\" like the burger though!  The smashed potato fries are fantastic, though I prefer them with ketchup.  The \"fries\" are like deep fried slices of baked potato, seasoned with sea salt and cracked pepper.  Don't forget to take a couple free salted chocolate chip cookies for dessert!  It's kind of a pain to get them yourself, and I think that the servers should consider offering a small plate of them to customers.  The servers don't even tell you about the cookies, much less help you get them out from under their enclosure as you use the tiny pair of tongs and hope said cookies don't slide off the provided napkins!  This goes back to my star-reducing \"decent but not great service\" factor.  Overall, decent enough service and really great food mean I will be back, but will have to be motivated to drive further past the more easily-accessible and better-serviced Zin Burger at Biltmore Fashion Park."}
{"text":"This is place is great and very unique. I had the ahi tuna sandwich, which was unlike any other ahi I have had before. We also shared the hummus which was outstanding. Loved the flavor and the fact that it was served with a fun medley vegetable crudite. The staff was attentive and in good sprits. Overall really enjoyed the experience and happily give it 5 stars for a great experience at tasty food stand!"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna sandwich is my go-to meal! The patio is amazing, drinks are refreshing, and you can't go wrong with their post-it note special."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite local spot! From the food to the service, ingos is top notch. Love how casual, relaxed, friendly and efficient the vibe is. When it comes to burgers, there is absolutely nothing better. Grass-fed meat melts in your mouth and is the absolute perfect size, never leaving you overly stuffed and bloated and instead always happy and satisfied.   Here are are my go-to's but you CANNOT go wrong. Drink: Greyhound (MUST) Apps: crudités (fresh heirloom veggies with homemade hummus and pumpkinseed dip-- I told you I was a regular) and shattered potato chips (ask for a side of homemade hot sauce). Burger: Farmers daughter with an egg or any burger with an egg! Crispy Chicken sandwich or tuna burger mmm! Oh yeah chicken and waffles are to die!   INGO on!"}
{"text":"Normally I am not a fan of 'the hipster burger joints', but in this case I was and there was a plethora of reasons to like. First off the bat is the fact that they have a very limited menu. Some people doesn't like this, I love it. If you want pasta, then go somewhere else. Want more beer options? Go to a bar. Doesn't want Chloe as a server, well I then loathe your very existence.  So from this limited menu, that is clearly dissected, analyzed and reassembled, I made a mistake. I ordered the Paris, Texas Burger WITHOUT asking it on a English muffin. I should have. I just should have.   Paris, Texas Burger The burger sure was fall apart tender. At the same time as the tenderness is a quality sign, it also make me look like a fool while trying hard to devour it. Innocently presented, but sneaky like a sloppy Joe. I gave up on eating it American style (that's with your hand people).. and resorted changing strategy to one with a fork. The flavors were there, but I would have chosen a different kind of cheddar, or maybe even go with a different kind of cheese (then again I am a stickler with consistency) and the pancetta  - it was freakishly awesome, was perfect as a burger topping and it came in profusion. What I didn't like was the bun. With that tender meat, the bun needs to be supportive, like a good friend during an intervention - not just pretty on the surface. The name of the burger doesn't make no sense at all. What is the Paris representative part? Was it that the bun was ready for an open relationship?   Fresh shattered potato chips This is the last thing that I need, but this is one thing that I will doubtlessly come back for. It looks like a sliced deep fried potato, but balances on that thin edge of awesomely crunchy before it would turn overdone. With this served Lebni which sounds like a east-european car brand, but isn't. Salt and pepper does the trick, but I would love to see a drop of fresh chipotle in there. Or the garlic-cucumber route to put a Greek spin on it. I'd also rename it 'devilishly specious potato'.  Beer While analyzing the beer choices, I couldn't agree more that the choices on the menu will suit most people thus make all sense to go that route. Again I love the decision to stay small, local & popular.   Homemade ice cream sandwich The choice of dessert is a an ice cream sandwich, with a scoop of peanut butter gelato as the buffer in this sweet menage a trois. I didn't like it - probably because peanut butter is not a dessert flavor to me. It's as deceitful as those parents that call raisins candy. It's lies.   Overall Ingo's did deliver. I didn't get to try the egg salad, that seems to suit everyone that had it. My hat is off for Mr Ruggiero, he knows what he has going here. And the service I assume was great, I know I couldn't have had a more informative and attentive server. Another reason why anyone would return."}
{"text":"The food is unbelievably good and seems pretty healthy hopefully it is haha. Service is always amazing as well nothing negative to say at all!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really picturing the inside of this place when I got there, however its a super interesting concept. Not sure what they do when it's busy since there appears to be limited seating. The food was great! Kinda bummed me out that the burger didn't come with anything additional which we found out after we got it. Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Lunch yesterday...deviled eggs, 1/2 chicken Sammy, 1/2 fish sandwich, then another order of deviled eggs. Lunch today...deviled eggs, 1/2 order of smashed chips, 1/2 order avocado toast, 1/2 order black bean burger, tiny sample of the pistachio and vanilla soft serve gelato. Pro Tip: go with a friend so getting 1/2 orders of more things is an option.   I enjoy a good picnic deviled egg as much as anyone, but the deviled eggs here are not your momma's picnic deviled egg. Goat cheese blended with the yolk. Who thinks of these things? It's worth coming here for if you ordered nothing else. They are amazing. 3 half-eggs to an order.  The chicken Sammy, fish sandwich and black bean burger all share the same light, delicious toasted bun. Can't go wrong with any of the 3 and I can't wait to go back to try those buns with a burger in between. Smashed chips are fantastic and a 1/2 order is plenty for two to share. Avocado toast is loaded with cheese and tomatoes and is crazy good.   Soft serve gelato? Yes, please. Every. Time. Thanks to Kent for the samples and for overseeing a fantastic kitchen and menu. You could easily drive past this place and miss it. Don't miss it. Not many places have me walking out and trying to think about how soon I can get back. Wish there was something close this good and innovative back home in Dallas."}
{"text":"I received an \"E Comp\" from La Grande Orange to check out there other restaurant Ingo's Tasty Food...  Thank you for the certificate!!!  First of all, it's seat yourself, so of course we chose the patio! Great ambiance with strung lights all over.  The food was delicious! I had a chicken sandwich that I'm pretty sure will be my go to- yum!  The manager is hilarious! We joked with her the whole time and she even gave my boyfriend and I a free chocolate chip sea salt cookie. They are his favorite! (Definitely recommend them!)  She explained about their food and I can't remember what all was said because it's been a little while since we went but I was very impressed about the chicken!  Ask your server. I'm pretty sure it's grown locally but can't remember!  We can't wait to go back to enjoy the patio and eat some delicious food :)"}
{"text":"I'm addicted.  That's the summary.  A) Grass fed burgers.  Automatic happy. B) Shattered potato chips with awesome dip/sauce stuff.  I could eat those all day. C) Indoor/Outdoor seating D) Prompt service F) Never too busy  We have not had a bad burger.  They are all delicious (so says my husband; I always order the cheeseburger).  The lemonade comes in a cup with finger imprints (for the clumsy, this is a plus.  It doesn't slip out of my hands!)  The menu is short and sweet and may not appease or appeal to all, but this girl who will jump at the sight of a grass fed burger cooked perfectly with delicious chips on the side is happy.  And there have been weeks where I've found any excuse to get myself there for dinner multiple nights in one week."}
{"text":"This is my gfs favorite spot to eat. The potato chips alone are worth coming back for. Delicious kale and quinoa salad and grass fed beef burgers. Definitely a great place to pig out at if you're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Ingos has a great atmosphere and food is great.  They use grass fed meat for all burgers and there are incredibly important reasons why grass fed is so much better. Both nutritionally and in treatment of animals.  All the other items on the menu are great as well, they have great beers, apps and other menu items besides burgers. The only recommendation I would offer the restaurant has to do with their \"to go\" burgers.  I'm not sure if it has to do with the bun and/or the way you request the burger to be cooked but only when I order to go I almost always get a soggy bun which I of course do not like. Eating at the restaurant this never happens.  Great place"}
{"text":"I have never felt so compelled to leave a review... If I wanted mediocre food and TERRIBLE service I would have had my husband cook me dinner. But really, jokes aside, I am entirely disappointed with my experience. After the raving reviews, I was so excited to give Ingos a try, and break away from my LGO routine. NEVER have I ever been so disappointed. Sure, we were asked about our food by 3 different people, yet all of them were unable to crack even the tiniest smile while they spewed off their robotic dialogue. I'm sorry, did I bother you by being here? Do you understand what it means to be in the service industry? 100% will never go back."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here if it's less than one hour before closing.  My husband and I are LGO and Chelsea's junkies and thought we would give their other restaurant, Ingo's a try for something different.  We arrived around 9:10 on a Sunday evening on a holiday weekend, closing was at 10.  Our server was clearly not happy that she had to take care of us and wanted to get out of there by 10:00 sharp.  Our entrees were brought out almost immediately after the appetizer and once the entrees arrived, we were never checked up on or asked if we wanted anything else, even though our wine glasses were completely empty and we would have gladly taken another round.  The check was delivered before we were even finished eating.  As for the food, it was hit or miss.  My husband's Paris Texas (veggie) burger was tasty, but my whitefish sandwich was small and bland.  The hummus was average, but the pumpkin seed dip that came with it was delicious.  Oh, and the shattered potato chips were pretty damn good too.  We did manage to get out of there well before 10, thanks to our turbo server.  Might go back and try again at a time that is more compatible with the servers' party schedules.  They do have the infamous evil white sangria and chocolate chip cookies w/sea salt on your way out.  Yum."}
{"text":"The best veggie burger with fantastic vegan cheese; incredibly filing and love how there is an easy to go option."}
{"text":"Ingo's has become a regular favorite for our family!  They have a menu that pleases all of our tastes.  and complementary cookies for dessert that satisfy your sweet tooth.  The staff is friendly and engaging.  Always enjoy dining here."}
{"text":"The crispy chicken Sammy was very good here. Thin breading and crispy as in the name.  The Apple added a great crunch and flavor, while the spicy aioli rounded out the flavoring.  The bread was fresh and a good compliment as well.   The green tea was tasty.  The fries were slices of potato crispy good with the sauce."}
{"text":"First off, The Paris Texas Burger is absolutely amazing. Its not even worth thinking about, just order it. I got a sangria with strawberries in it, and it was super sweet but delicious. They had dog water bowls being it is primarily an outdoor dog friendly patio. The service was very good, they were on top of everything. Even our dog was lucky enough to get a plain patty!   The only thing I would say is if you have a large dog, make sure you sit closer to the outside of the patio because everything is very close together."}
{"text":"Best tasting beef in town, bar none. Burgers are better than Delux's. Shattered chips are addictive and chicken sandwich will blow your mind. The tiny, cylindrical building is cool and very fun. The slightly crowded kitchen churns out a surprising amount of killer food. Colorful, funky, musical and totally unique. Rally the fam and the pups, Ingo's is a stand-out."}
{"text":"This is a fun local eatery with great outdoor seating and complimentary chocolate chip sea salt cookies!  Their shattered chips with jalapeño sauce are a crowd favorite. I'd liken them to a cross between french fries and potato chips, or the natural word-meld \"frips.\" Some are thicker cuts of tater, others are thins crisps, so everyone is happy. One order is good to share as a side for two people. I also overheard a guy at the next table ask for a half-order which isn't on the menu, but apparently is allowed!  My husband and I had the Paris, Texas Burger and White Fish Sandwich. Both were good, although the fish serving was a bit small and the buns were the kind of white bun that leaves you feel like you're eating air.   We didn't order drinks, but they have a ridiculously long happy \"hour\" that runs from 11am to 7pm and includes beer, sangria, wine, and cocktails.  The decor is colorful and tables are well-shaded. My only other critique is that the service felt a bit over-attentive. The waitress asked permission to refill our water glasses and cleared my plate while I still had a bite in my hand (not to be pushy, just trying to serve well). Although, I am coming from cold Boston, so the friendliness is partially just a bit of a culture shock!  Overall it's definitely worth a try. Check out the LGO grocery and knick knack store across the street if you have time to poke around, and don't forget to grab some of those complimentary cookies on your way out!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My fiancée and I went here last weekend and had two of the best burgers we've ever had in AZ. I had the Paris Texas Burger, and I asked for ketchup so I could squeeze it all over my burger like I always do, but then I took one bite of the burger and realized this was definitely not a burger in need of any condiments, it was perfect as is! We also had their home made chips and dipped them in their jalapeño sauce. Also, their outdoor patio setup was very spacious and inviting. We have our wedding coming up in October and will definitely be sending our friends and family here!"}
{"text":"If you're in the NE Phoenix  area Ingo's is definitely the place to go of you're looking for a nice chill lunch. The staff was friendly and very helpful for a first time customer 5 star place for sure"}
{"text":"Oh my, my second time here and the food is just as delicious as before even togo! We had the chicken sammy and the indigo burger  With 2 sides of the smashed shattered  fries Everything was wonderful and cooked to perfection You can not beat the price  Portions allthough smaller than most sandwich shops,  they make up for the taste and presentation  Not greasy and so tasty yummy perfect combination of flavors If you park at curbside the servers come to you, great service with a smile Try them out, you do not want to give this place a miss"}
{"text":"Updating my review to 5 stars for Ingo's! We have dined in multiple times now & have consistently had great experiences. Their food is always delicious & the service is good. Our favorite menu items are the Crispy Chicken Sammy & Farmer's Daughter Burger with a side of Fresh Shattered Potato Chips (big enough for two to share)!  We have brought multiple friends with us, some from in town & others who were visiting us from out of town. Everyone is always impressed with this place! We will definitely continue dining here & bringing our friends with us."}
{"text":"They gave us a tiny plate of potatoes out of the four meals we ordered because they ran out of potatoes. Before we left, they mentioned they had potatoes now but were reluctant to give us the remaining potatoes to go. Indicating we were simply asking for more? Umm no, we didn't get any with our meals to begin with.   The waitress was dropping f-bombs behind our toddlers which made the whole experience worse.   AND Don't drink from the glasses. Orange juice spots are caked to the bottom of the cups. Gross!   Horrible experience. :("}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. The name Ingo's Tasty Food is very accurate! Tasty food attentive service! Erin was the best! You gotta have the fresh shattered potato chips with their homemade hot sauce. The tuna burger and white fish club sandwich were tasty and well presented. Deserts were good even though they were not on the menu. Highly recommend a visit to this hip local spot with street side dining."}
{"text":"I live a couple of minutes away; why has it taken me so long to dine here?! Cool corner eatery/bar in Arcadia. Chill atmosphere,good music, friendly staff, cool-looking chefs(love the mini-mohawk man) and nice patio(dog- friendly).   First bite of their burger is like no other, light, airy, crisp & flavorful at the same time.   Buns are deliciously toasted, good sharp cheddar cheese,  crisp bacon,  juicy burger patty that is steamed then finished off with a pink center! Eh, on the pickles, too salty.  Great shattered potatoes(like my mom's) with a creamy dill(?) dip. Didn't care for their home made jalapeno dip that doesn't pair well with the potatoes, possibly better with tortilla chips.  Delicious, tart lemonade.   Overall, a must try!"}
{"text":"The shattered chips are so good. I also had the ingos cheeseburger. It was Adam and Eve style and it was still so good. Definitely a good place for a burger."}
{"text":"Great weather and fun patio with dogs and good food. Wait staff was a bit co fusing but I think we caught a seat when the waitress was on break. They got it figured out. Had the chop salad, delicious but a but too much lemon made it hard to finish. It won't keep me from coming back often"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, very accommodating. Food is just mediocre and menu is very very limited. Seemed overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Ingo's is a neat little spot, with an interesting concept.  I agree with Lindsey H. who called it a 'gourmet concession stand'.  The inside only seats about 12 people, but there is lots of outdoor seating!  The menu is also quite basic and small, but you can tell the main focus is on the ingredients.  You can get any burger Adam and Eve style (naked- with lettuce), on a LGO English muffin, or on one of there homemade hamburger buns.  I went with great company, Jon and Amy, so we each got a burger in a different style, of course Jon went naked :P   Amy had the burger with sauerkraut (Ingo Burger), I think we all agree that was the best burger and quite unique with great flavors.  Amy said, \"This is the best burger I have had in a long time!\"  Jon and I were a bit jealous.  We both opted for their version of a bacon cheddar burger (Paris-Texas Burger), which had Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese (for the record I LOVE this cheese), a homemade sweet barbecue sauce, and crispy pancetta.  It was quite good, but I have had better bacon-burgers in my day.  I also found the barbecue sauce to be a bit sweet for my liking.  Jon and I still devoured every last morsel, so I am not really complaining as it was good food.    The menu was lacking side dish options and salads.  We had the spiced up potato chips that are made in house and comes with their version of a sour cream dip.  It was good comfort food, but very fried.  The only salad on the menu is a quinoa and kale salad, so if you don't like that 'stuff' you are SOL.  This is not a bar, but it is also worth noting the beer and wine options are limited...but they are only $3 during happy hour, which we managed to make by 7min (ends at 6pm).    Last but not least, our amazing server told us about their ice cream sandwich dessert with Belgium chocolate and peanut-butter!!!  If I wasn't stuffed and heading to the gym right after eating I would have been all over that!! I will be back to try that for sure, but I would come back in general anyway :)"}
{"text":"The food here is just sooo good! I love this place from the design to the service to the food. I had multiple dishes as I came here hung over & was starving the first time. The watermelon salad was amazing, but the Ingo's burger made my day. The grass-fed beef is great. It was ridiculously good. In fact, I've been back twice to get a burger to go since then.  I wish it was closer to my place, but that is no a deal breaker. They lose one star for not having Tito's Vodka & a little more of a wine selection. I plan on heading back there for food very soon."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of positive things around town about Ingo's.  Best Burger I have had in town.  Fantastic service, reasonably priced.  Good local beer as well.  Only knock would be the hybrid fries/potato chips...  They just weren't my thing (more of a personal dislike rather than a knock on the establishment).  Mrs Z had the gelato to finish and loved it."}
{"text":"Apparently people are having a much better experience than I did. Because of the good ratings, I was interested in checking it out. My husband and I stopped by when Ingo first opened, I order the salmon burger, and it was completely raw inside, I wasn't expecting to have a sushi burger. When I inquired about the sandwich, they told me that's how it's supposed to look, but I know what raw and rare look like. My husband didn't really care for his order either. Could have just been an off day. Maybe one day we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service. Their burgers are excellent: juicy, flavorful, delicious. My friends enjoyed their veggie burger and chicken sandwich too. The chicken sandwich was ordered grilled, but arrived breaded and was sent back. That was just the beginning of service that was just awful. The food arrived, but we had no silverware or napkins. One of my group of 3 asked for utensils, so the waitress brought her a knife and fork. The other 2 didn't get any. Then I asked for utensils (ordered burger with no bun-I really needed utensils) and she brought mine, but no napkin, and neither for the 3rd person. When the chicken sandwich came prepared as ordered, she STILL didn't bring utensils! Later after the plates were cleared the waitress asked my friend if she wanted more ice water. She didn't offer iced tea to the other 2 people sitting there with empty glasses. Then another server filled up my friend's glass with black tea, but didn't fill mine with green. I had to ask yet another server for more tea. It was bizarre-they couldn't see the needs of the whole table, just 1 person at a time. They need to hire some smarter people, these dingbats are hurting business."}
{"text":"I never knew this place was right across the Postino's and LGO!! How I got here was due to eating at a sister restaurant, Chelsea's Kitchen. I received a certificate to dine in and I finally made it a point to come in for a bite or two. Today I came in for a super late lunch - at 4:30pm-  or you could call it an early dinner. Parking lot was a bit sparse but so is the rest of the other restaurants' parking. (Would be such a pain but luckily we came at such an odd time!)   I accidentally walked in the employee door where the staff forgave me and allowed me to enter. Otherwise, you should enter at the front double doors facing the street.  There are tables outside with heat lamps and then an inside bar that can seat about 16ish or so. 4 of us chose to sit inside since it was bitter cold outside. The area was shaped in a circular shape so that patrons can view the chefs. 2 chefs were working behind the somewhat covered kitchen while a couple staff members (maybe one was the owner) took orders and held the fort indoors.   The menu was limited as the space. Everything is a la carte style. I started off with drip coffee with cream and sugar to fend off the cold weather. Then I tried the freshly cut and cooked seasoned potato chips with skin-on with a sour cream-like sauce on top. Chomp chomp! Then I tried the Ingo's Cheeseburger made with grass fed beef, black creek cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo, dill pickle in between soft brioche bread. They cook their patties medium pink but of course you may choose to alter the making of that. This was quite juicy and delicious. The \"No.1 Tuna Burger\" was a tuna party, lettuce, avocado and a Siracha-mayo sauce (to give it the kick) in between a pillowy brioche bread. This actually seemed like a No.2 burger compared  to the Ingo's Cheeseburger just because it didn't seem as flavorful although both were juicy.   I was getting quite full but had to get something sweet so ordered a couple sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Found out that those were complimentary! Yummy for a Cookie Monsterish chick like me. My eyes became not full but my stomach was.  I ate 2 small cookies with the rest of my coffee.   The server was energetic and always checked how we were doing. Overall I enjoyed the freshly made meals and the comp cookies. I also saw that they make fresh juices too! I'll have to give that a try for next time! They have happy hour drinks from 11am to 7pm weekdays. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this spot. Another champ from the lgo family.. The hummus and veggie plate is beyond beautiful and delicious.  They have some similar items from the menu across the street at \"Lgo\" and have a great patio. The best is the happy hour from 11am to 7pm and they have a wonderful cocktail called the ingo's greyhound, mint leaves, grapefruit, Lemon and GIN!!!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places! You can tell they pay attention to every detail, from the ingredients they use to the quality of service! Everyone is friendly...love sitting inside to watch the line. The burgers are amazing, as well as the chips. I am confident everything on the menu is amazing!"}
{"text":"Second trip in: The fried fish sandwich is delish and ask for a side of the fermented jalapeño sauce. It makes everything it touches AMAZING!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Shattered potato chips... Yum. Deviled eggs... Yum. Chicken salad... Yum... Chicken Sammy... Yum. And top it off with the fresh baked cookies, it was the perfect brunch! I would highly recommend Ingos. The food really is tasty!!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM, oh ya and YUM! My boyfriend and I loved every bite and minute we spent here. The homemade chips are amazing, our burger was to die for and we also filled up on the hummus and the amazing cookie ice cream sandwiches. All of our servers were on their game and so kind & welcoming. It's also fun that the kitchen is so open. It feels like you are apart of the whole process. I would absolutely go back again and again."}
{"text":"The tuna burger is delicious!  Menu is reasonably-priced and the service is quick and friendly.  This is a great place for lunch on a nice day."}
{"text":"Fun concept and it's always nice to be able to sit outside this time of year. The burger was quite tasty, but I think some of their sides stand out more than the burgers themselves. Thought about going back several times to give it another shot, but each time I get there I end up deciding to visit LGO across the street instead, which may be the best summary of it I can give."}
{"text":"Omgoodness! My husband and I came here for an improvised date night last Friday. We did not know what to expect but we were amazingly surprised. He ordered their BBQ style burger and an iced tea; I got the classic burger and a frozen vodka lemonade. We also shared an order of chips with tzatziki and tomatillo salsa. Everything was absolutely delicious! To be honest, I'm craving those chips and dip right now. And I could go to one or two of those lemonades every weekend. Hoping they open up one of these places closer to home."}
{"text":"Ingo's has quickly become one of my favorite spots for a quick lunch or dinner. The simple menu has something for everyone. Ingo's Cheeseburger is fast becoming my favorite burger, the Crispy Chicken Sammy is delicious and the Shattered Potato Chips are amazing.  For a small patio restaurant with limited space I've never had trouble getting a seat. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ingos, you are so cute. I really want to have a huge crush on you. BUT... the food's just OK. The potatoes and sauce?? Awesome. The chicken sandwich?? Awesome. The free cookies? So awesome. But the other stuff I've had there... rice bowl, tuna burger, have been bland and just... OK."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a rainy Saturday--it was great timing --we were able to sit down at the counter immediately.  We ordered the chips to start.  We are a family who likes our fried foods well done or extra crispy---these did not disappoint and the dip they come with is fantastic.  We all ordered burgers.  They are very good--but I know now that I will order a little differently next time--they were a little too pink for my tastes--not their fault--they were exactly as they were described on the menu. next time I will order a little more well done--which will also give a chance for the cheese to melt a little more.  We shared a couple of ice cream sandwiches (which were given to us for free for a little tiny mix up on ordering--how cool is that--what great service)  as the rain stopped it started to fill up.  by the way the building is great looking--so simple, but there is something sublime about it and loved the McIntosh vintage amplifier--spitting out the tunes.    Will definitely be back to sample some more of the menu."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the LGO and this new amazing place just proved again that this team definitely knows what they are doing.   The atmosphere at this new place is purely amazing!  Three of us went for the first time around dinner time. The Food was really amazing. In my opinion sizes are perfect; however, that is the only one thing me and my boyfriend disagreed on as he thought that portions are bit small....No surprise there...hahhaha  We ordered their popular chips and I do not know if I like chips or dip more! These amazing chips were Crispy, crunchy, and served with a lemony tazaki kind of dip (not sure what exactly it was but - it's super legit!) Ketchup who?     For dinner me and my friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had a Paris, Texas burger of course. I was lucky to try both as me and him split ours....Crispy chicken was amazing, the spicy aioli they use is out of this world. The chicken was crispy but yet nice and tender at the same time. I loved the apples and dill pickle combination in sandwich as well. Burger was good as well but I am not big on red meet so I am not as good judge on that. However, I can say my boyfriend liked it a lot.   The only thing I did not like is the fact that they served food and drinks in plastic ware. Food in plastic didn't bother me as much as drinks did. For example, the beer would have been fresher in a cold glass as opposed to a plastic cup. But perhaps that is just me....  Outside seating area is amazing....Overlooking Campbell avenue with beautiful lighting outside was great! Service was amazing as well. The fact that their chef came out and asked how the food was, is kind of place I would for sure go back too.   Everyone there was really nice and friendly and I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. I've been here several times. Very casual and friendly. Amazing service. Nice people. I've had several of the hamburgers - very good. Last night I tried the fish sandwich!!!!  Wonderful. My wife likes the salads. Go there."}
{"text":"Good food & friendly staff gets my vote! Love the shattered fries with yogurt sauce. Local fresh food and reasonable prices. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.  Dog friendly. Great chicken sandwich.  Potato chips are to die for.   Excellent servers.  Especially Anthony."}
{"text":"It's a cute restaurant....  but that's it. The menu is so limited and everything is overpriced. It is nice to be able to order some of Chelsea's Kitchen's stuff like Tuna Burger and Kale Salad for a reasonable price but I'd rather go to LGO, Chelsea's or Postino's. The food was OK but overpriced for what you get. My friend and I ordered the Kale Salad and a lemonade. They also charge $1 for a lemonade refill. Paid $14.50 including tip and we left hungry. Parking is so limited - same as LGO."}
{"text":"Ingo's is one of our standard go-to places. To the point that we've made a rule that we can only eat there one a week! The menu is small but everything on it is really well done. The chips are a \"must have\". I prefer to ask for them to be extra crispy. And the sauces are delicious. Service is usually good. It's definitely a dog friendly place, but a small patio so not a good place for a rambunctious pup. I haven't had the weekend breakfast yet, but I'm definitely planning to try it sometime."}
{"text":"What's not to love?! This place has decent cocktails, dog friendly patio, free cookies, unlimited lacto fermented hot sauce, and the best vegan burger I have ever eaten! To make it Vegan you can get it with an english muffin or as a lettuce wrap. The service is usually decent, depends on how busy they are though. My boyfriend is in love with their fish sandwich, and I feel price wise everything is reasonable."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, service is so so.  A must go for sure for casual lunch / dinner. food /drinks / location are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is cute! It's small, intimate, and very personable!   Our server Mimi was adorable! She attended to our needs very promptly.   I ordered housemade lemonade to drink. It was tangy and minty! Perfect for a hot summer day out in the porch :)  I got their cheeseburger with chips. My burger was juicy and pink, just how I love it! The pickles on the burger were so good! They were those pickles that aren't fully pickled. Lol the chips were interesting. They came with this delicious yogurt sauce that has garlic and lemon juice in it.  I had to get dessert. I got a mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. Delicious! Just delicious!   I would definitely return to this place!"}
{"text":"Ended up at Ingo's on a whim today and had one of those accidentally awesome experiences that ensures I will be a return customer.  My boyfriend and I arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday and immediately found seating at the bar, which is awesome because it is essentially \"in\" the kitchen. We ordered deviled eggs to start and were impressed by their size and creamy filling. For the price, I wish they would add another piece to the serving, but after getting so much other good food, it was not an issue.  I immediately fell in love with the idea of getting the tuna burger, but due to shipment issues and the morning rush, they were out. The boyfriend and I decided on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Paris, Texas Burger and our server talked us into a side of chips.  The sandwiches came out pre-split (which is ideal as my bf and I love to share) and the chips were just as delicious as promised (they use baked potatoes, which gives the chips an awesome texture and flavor)! Our server also hooked us up with a salted caramel Gelato sandwich to make up for the lack of tuna sandwich, which was very yummy too!  Overall, we had a great experience with delicious food and conscientious service. Next time (which I hope is very soon!!), I want to try the egg salad (weekends only, looks amazing and innovative) and the tuna sandwich. Keep up the good work Ingo's!"}
{"text":"Love the grass fed beef, you can definitely taste the difference! The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't have fries, and the potato chips were ok but not worth 4 bucks. They should raise the price of the burger and include fries :)"}
{"text":"Great service! Jenny and Erin were great!  The plastic wine glasses are unique. There is currently no wifi, so not a work lunch place. But the overall atmosphere is great and the music sets a great vibe. And the veggie, hummus, and pumpkin seed dip dish is delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. I love the circular patio and all of the employees are helpful and friendly. Their patio is also dog-friendly which I always enjoy. So why only 3 stars? There are just a few things that make me feel like this place will not be a regular on my restaurant rotation.  Ingo's has become a mecca for families with young children. That's okay but just go knowing that you will probably hear a few kids screaming or crying at any given moment. The shattered potatoes were good but needed more seasoning--they were basically fried potatoes with pretty minimal seasonings. And the  burger? It was good but I wasn't amazed. The kaiser roll got pretty soggy by the time I was done eating (and I'm a fast eater!). I think pretzel rolls or something else might hold up better.   Overall, Ingo's is a fun place. The food is decent and the vibe is fun. I'm sure I'll be back, especially for happy hour when certain wine is $3/glass! But the overall experience and food doesn't have me dying to go back too often."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken and fish burgers--both were incredible. Service was a bit hit or miss. We would go back for food!"}
{"text":"Make time to go to Ingos..   This quaint establishment is a must stop for me at least twice a month .. ..    My wife and I truly enjoy everything about this place .. For me personally once I try something I really enjoy I usually don't sway towards anything else ...    I always order their chips w/ aoli dipping sauce .. amazing  .. So amazing!!  and their Sammy chix sandwich is exceptional ..lightly breaded chix breast with green apple slice , a special aoli and a fresh bun .. I'm getting hungry just typing this .. I pair this w/ their gin greyhound which is in my top 5 best greyhounds ..  The service is always friendly and cute.. The management is always their to make sure your experience is great, which make this spot one of my favorite stops in Phx area .."}
{"text":"When I saw a rotunda like restaraunt I knew I had to pop in. Parking is rough here, spots are slim to none. Parked West of the building in the neighboring lot and it's a pretty small lot so it was not the most fun maneuvering around or getting out afterwards.   Had the Paris Texas Burger, Fresh Shattered Potato Chips, and the Housemade Lemonade. The Lemonade wasn't sweet at all, so you might want to ask for some sugar packets. The Paris Texas Burger was savory and delicious. The atmosphere was pleasant, had string lights, and trees. Definitely a great spot in the evening. Service was excellent, attentative and amiable! The Shattered Potato Chips were okay, they taste super salty and burnt to me.  But loved their version of tzatziki sauce. Would go as far as to say that their sauce was better than the chips. The complimentary cookies were very hard/tough.  Burger, atmosphere, and service was great! Not a huge fan of the parking situation, lemonade, or chips."}
{"text":"A friend and I accidentally stumbled upon this place en route to the Postino across the street. The interesting look and feel of this restaurant, coupled with the outdoor seating and the cooling weather enticed us to give their **tasty food** a try.   I ended up going with the Cale & Quinoa Salad, while my friend tried out the Mother Earth on Toast (vegetarian burger on toast, essentially). In preparation for an eventful evening, we both had their Single Cup Brew coffee... in all respects, it turned out to be just an average dining experience. The food wasn't overly exciting and the coffee was ordinary. To top it all off, our waitress (although attentive) seemed to be very distant and uninterested. Both my friend and I found it to be rather strange.  Nothing to seriously write home about, which was disappointing because the restaurant looked pretty trendy!"}
{"text":"Sit in the sun with a sangria pitcher and potato chips during happy hour for a nice escape from reality. Fresh veggies with double dip were also very good. Burger was juicy but had too much relish. Food prices are typical for the LGO/Postino corner."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried this place for happy hour and we both agreed that the name is appropriate. In addition to tasty fare, the patio makes a very pleasant hangout and the service is fast and friendly. I hesitated to come here only because I thought parking would be a problem, but it turns out that I need not have worried because they provide additional parking a short block away."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend this week.  Can't say I would want to go back.  Service  (patio) was great.  Paris Texas burger was very good although a bit on the small side.  Guess I must have automatically gotten the petite size and did not notice they had a regular size offered. I had read the reviews of the smashed potato chips and was hoping to experience a really good side but alas it was a BIG disappointment.  The chips were mostly burnt and the lebni sauce wasn't all that good.  The pickled jalapeno sauce was at least enjoyable when I could find an unburnt chip to dip it into.  The Moscow Mule was served in some type of copper cup which transferred the tinny taste to the drink so that was most unpleasant.  Might have been better if it had not been served in the cup but I am not going back to get another one and ask for a glass container to see.  On the whole if you stick to the regular size hamburger and forget everything else on the menu you will not be disappointed but if you try other items be ready to be sorry.  After all the good reviews I read I am wondering about their taste buds have gone on strike or they just don't want to truly critique the place."}
{"text":"Well I just found my favorite burger joint in Phoenix, it is Ingo's.  It is a really cute place across from LGO.  Everything about this place is awesome.  The only down side is that they do not have a whole lot of seating inside the restaurant.  But they do have tables outside.    The reason why this place is my favorite burger joint is because of the Ingo Burger.  It has sauerkraut, Dijon sauce and to top it off I got it on a English Muffin.    Let's just say I will totally be coming back here all the time."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review to five stars, because I've grown to really love this place. I've pretty much eaten my way through the menu (it's small, please don't judge :-D ) and each new thing I've tried has been better than the last. The chicken schnitzel is amazing, full of crunch and flavor, and the Ingo burger is one of the best (get it on an English muffin). The service has been consistently good as well as welcoming, and they're now offering complimentary sea salt cookies (the same ones from Chelsea's) which are amazing!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful black tea and the Kale and Quinoa Salad was a different combination for a salad and very tasty.  Friendly cheery staff, good music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really like Ingo's. And yes, their food is tasty. This casual dog-friendly patio hangout, right across the street from its parent restaurant La Grande Orange (or, LGO) offers the same high quality eats. Although Ingo's menu is small, each item is chock-full of fresh ingredients and flavor. I really like the black bean burger; in all honesty, it is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had anywhere. The kale and quinoa salad is also yummy and full of good-for-you ingredients that makes you feel like you did your body a favor. The deviled eggs and shattered potato chips (very similar to really thick potato chips) are delicious. I usually order 2 of each. Ingo's is a la carte and each menu item will cost you between $7-9 (except for the deviled eggs and shattered potato chips, both of which are considered appetizers and are both under $5).  Check out Ingo's and try some tasty food. :)"}
{"text":"Gourmet version of any regular American food place.  6/10 for taste. Get the big burger (5oz I believe) if you want the size equivalent that to a regular size cheeseburger.  No French fries but they do have their own version called fresh shattered potato chips. Eh.  I'd return here if I'm in the area, only for the sea salt chocolate chip cookies they gave us when leaving."}
{"text":"The servers are always nice and down to earth. This is a good place to have a peaceful bite to eat outside. Selection isn't huge, but still good."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burger and it was just as mouth-watering as I expected it to be - with perfect breading on the outside and a wonderful bun, plus delightful pickles to add some crunch. The shattered potato chips are AMAZING, especially with the dip they provide. The tea is very unique and delicious. Basically, the food here is perfect and the atmosphere is cute, so I will be coming back here as much and as often as possible."}
{"text":"My second time at Ingo's and it was hit! I love the concept of a gourmet food stand! Quick, easy and inexpensive.  We've sat both times inside at the bar so we can watch the action in the kitchen.  Great menu and great service. The tuna burger is awesome and full of flavor.  Must have the shattered chips! I will be making regular stops here, what a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm thinking there is going to be a lot more of this place in my future.  I finally tried that elusive egg salad only served for one hour. Incredible. I truly believe eggs are the perfect food. I also believe I might be addicted to food considering I am writing this update solely for an egg salad sandwich.   Send help."}
{"text":"Before I start, I must say that I'm quite salty that LGO took the Shangri-La veggie burger off the menu when this place opened up.   It was a good marketing strategy, because it forced me to go over here for a veggie burger. I ended up with the avocado toast. It was delicious! A little garlicky for my taste, but I know my boyfriend - the garlic lover - would have enjoyed it. The sangria was great for $5. I am not a white sangria fan, but this was their only option and it did not disappoint me.   They have an AMAZING happy hour. 11-7pm mon-fri!!!! This place is less than one mile from my office...dangerous."}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly my favorite spot in Phoenix. It's pretty much why my husband and I live where we do. We love the crispy chicken sandwich & the kale, quinoa salad + crispy chicken - seriously, it's the best! They just started serving breakfast so we had to try it. We indulged ourselves by trying the cinnamon rolls (baked to order perfection), the english muffin with yummy preserves and the chorizo burrito, dipped in their jalapeño hot sauce, is what dreams are made of. Our hearts and stomachs are always so happy at Ingos!"}
{"text":"Amazing service on top of amazing food makes ingos a must try in Phoenix! A handsome gentleman (Anthony I believe) greeted us with a welcoming smile and suggested  their in house iced teas and the hummus dip, we were NOT disappointed! You can taste the freshness of everything you eat here and thats a rarity in todays world. Following our app came the fish sandwich and shattered potato chips, TO DIE FOR! We will definitely be visiting ingos on a regular basis :)"}
{"text":"Had a terrific burger here for dinner.  As for Ingo's as a whole, still not quite sure what to make of the place.  When you drive up to 40th St and Campbell, this tall cylindrical building on the northwest corner sticks out like a sore thumb.  I knew going in that it was an LGO restaurant (the same folks behind popular Arcadia neighborhood hangouts like La Grande Orange Grocery/Pizzeria and Chelsea's Kitchen), but the building is pretty unconventional even for LGO.  And as with the other LGO spots, parking is sparse at best.  Fortunately we got here at the right time on Sunday and got a spot.  There's actually quite a bit of seating outside the building.  Its shaded too, but it was 110 degrees today so we chose to eat inside.  First thing you notice walking inside is the tray of cookies right in front of the main entrance.  They're complimentary and taste great (basically the same complementary cookies you get at Chelsea's).  The rest of the interior mimics the building construction itself with the grill right in the center of the interior.  A circular counter surrounds the grill with waitresses in between you and the grill.  The menu is very limited, but I already knew I wanted a burger.  Specifically, I came for the Farmer's Daughter burger.  Dijon sauce, sauerkraut, and swiss cheese.  The toppings were great, but honestly the unique beef was what sold me on this burger.  Its a grass-fed, hormone-free beef from a free range family farm in Wisconsin.  I honestly don't actively seek hormone free or free range beef, but WOW this burger was unbelievably juicy.  I'm not sure why Ingo's seeks out this product, but boy am I glad they do.  I was a little weirded out that the burger didn't come with a side, but the burger was good enough that I forgot about it.  My only compliant about the burger would be that I wished it were bigger.  Total cost for the burger, a beer, plus tax and tip was $17.  The burger by itself was $9 which is a little steep for the portion I got (thus why I can't give this 5 stars), though I get that its a special type of beef that probably costs more.  We were in and out of this place in 20 minutes.  Staff was friendly and helped explain the menu to us.  It wasn't busy today, though I'm sure this place is nuts during the weekday lunch hour.  And I can definitely understand Yelpers' frustration with the parking situation.  If my burger hadn't been so awesome, I probably would've given this place 3 stars.  But the beef really is that good, so 4 stars it is.  Much of the rest of the menu is on the healthier (and cheaper) end so I'll do some more exploring next time I'm here.  But for the record, the Farmers Daughter is definitely among the Top 5 burgers I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Came here for a spur-of-the-moment dinner last night with a friend while exploring her Arcadia neighborhood.. I'd been interested in Ingo's for a while, and I'm SO glad I finally got to try this spot!!  I got the slider-sized veggie burger with the shattered chips, while my friend got the kale and quinoa salad with crispy chicken. I was starving by the time we'd decided to have dinner, and my meal was more than filling. I'm not vegetarian, but I tend to eat veggie when dining out, and I LOVED my burger.. it was perfectly crisped on the outside and that vegan cheese is still making me drool. The fries were amazing -if you're not a huge potato chip fan, you could definitely share this, since it's a very generous portion.   While I'm not generally in the Arcadia area, if I find myself nearby and hungry in the future, I'd definitely come back to Ingo's. Plus.. did I mention, they have free salted chocolate chip cookies?! Yes please and thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in thinking I was going to grab a quick lunch. Left having ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and then dessert! The sandwiches were amazing, accompanied by delicious homemade sauces. I will be going back, often!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. The food is so fresh, light, refreshing, and delicious.  We had the \"No.1 Tuna Burger,\" \"Shredded Kale and Quinoa Salad,\" and the \"Fresh Shattered Potato Chips.\"  The No.1 Tuna Burger consists of super grade tuna and bulgur wheat, spicy aioli, and avocado. So delicious. The Shredded Kale and Quinoa salad includes sunflower seeds, grapes, red pepper, parmesan and manchego. It was okay. Wasn't that impressed with it to be honest. It lacked a savory element and I didn't like the grapes but it's very refreshing as a side.  The shredded potato chips were really good with the Lebni side sauce.  The atmosphere is interesting. It's like a family oriented bar. I sat next to a family with a baby while upbeat dance music played at a medium volume that allowed for conversation. I'm really excited to know this restaurant exists because it's a cool restaurant/bar with great food. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"I honestly don't like giving bad reviews, so the one star is for the great location. The facts: the burger was small and had a funky taste - we both had the Texas burger- the bun was paper thin, no refills on water, and no utensils. Really wanted to like this place. But didn't happen. Not sure why the great reviews. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"A beacon of light amongst a grim and draining work seminar.  During a work trip in Phoenix, I decided I needed some good food to keep me from trying to strangle myself with my conference lanyard. As always, I turn to yelp to guide me in the right direction. On overnight trips I get a dinner expense allotment and try to buy as many items as possible before I hit the max. If you're going to keep me in a cold, dark room for 10 hours and feed me nasty turkey meat and caesar salad all day, you will pay (literally and figuratively).  I found this beautiful gem and decided to get an Uber for pick up. I called ahead and they have curbside service which is cool. I ordered 4 items and only used 1/3 of my allotment. As a regular person, that's awesome! As a tired employee seeking vengeance, I was bummed out. I get there and run into two of the nicest servers/cashiers/to-go bag getters ever. They are just so helpful and happy, especially since they were about to close, I was so confused. They also kept complimenting me, that I started really feelin myself a little too much on a Tuesday night.  I get the green sauce and some cookies and I'm on my way. I decide to give a cookie to my Uber driver for waiting. He was pleased.  I ordered the deviled eggs, kale salad, chicken sammy and black bean burger.   Kale Salad - UM. YES. Kale on it's own, can really bum someone out. But this salad was amazing. The flavors blended so well. And even though it's not the biggest, it's rather filling.  5 Stars  Deviled Eggs - Good. It was closer to an ice cream scoop on the egg than a dollop. Nice and creamy. Memorable though? Not really. 3.9 Stars  Black Bean Burger - UM. YES Please. Simple burger, but great. Soft bread. Flavorful patty and spread. Just a good bite. Spicy though? Not to me. 4.8 Stars  Chicken Sandwich - Another win! Although I must admit, at this point I started getting dizzy from all the wonderful flavors building up on my palate , I thoroughly enjoyed it. The chicken wasn't really crispy (again, it was take out), but the sandwich is good. Nice kick from the aioli and balance from the apple.  I know you're wondering, did she finish it all? Well, you'll never know. I don't like being judged, especially on crowd-sourced websites. But what I will tell you is that I feel like a champion.  Oh, and I have yet to try the complimentary cookie, but my awesome Uber driver thought it was great."}
{"text":"Simple little place, fast to get your food . The burgers are awesome they're super light and airy so you don't feel overwhelmed after eating. Cute patio to sit outside and it's reasonably priced. I got the black bean burger and it was really great. Recommend trying this out"}
{"text":"This place serves perfectly portioned meals. I ordered the Paris Texas Burger and it was very delectable. The meat was perfectly cooked, juicy and had the right flavors you are looking for a burger. The bun was also very soft and scrumptious. The servers were well attentive. This little gem is a must visit."}
{"text":"Get the crispy chicken sammich. Best fried chicken I've ever had, and the pickle+apple combo is out of this world. I can't stress this enough.   My boyf got the burger and also loved it. Oh, and the chips are delicious (we split them and it was plenty, the dippin sauces are original and so, so great)...and and and the people who work here are so nice and great! If you haven't eaten here yet you are missing out big time!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place in the Arcadia neighborhood!  I met a coworker here for lunch and we sat outside to enjoy our tasty chicken sandwich...it was the kind of chicken sandwich that you can't stop thinking about and crave it often.  It was a little pricey, but worth every penny.  This place gets busy, so anticipate a wait."}
{"text":"You can drop a hundred here & there at nearby steak houses, however Ingo's will satisfy you with fresh, perfectly done eats for a fraction of the cost. Beau enjoyed the fish sandwich and my guacamole veggie dish was the envy of the counter. What gorgeous veggie colors & presentation. Perfect ending to an early evening out.  Free salty, chocolate chip bites. This is a really nice touch.   Staff friendly & professional."}
{"text":"What??!?? INGO's Crispy Chicken Sammy (100% natural chicken schnitzel, dill pickle, spicy aioli, granny smith apple) goes 'IN' my questioning mouth & then it's 'GOne' haha!!    I know, I know!  Thinly sliced apples on a chicken sandwich?  At first it's a bit strange but then with each additional bite it becomes WOW!  Even my guy friends surprisingly fell in 'awesome like' with it!  TONI'S Deviled Eggs (german mustard, goat cheese, pickled beet, dill): I remembered them from a previous restaurant they had & the deviled eggs are still very tasty.  INGO'S Greyhound (gin, fresh grapefruit, lemon, mint) was smooth.   And my friend had her favorite: the PARIS, TEXAS burger (certified angus beef, apple bbq sauce, nueske's bacon, cheddar, lettuce, dill pickle). Hers was really nice but the Chicken Sammy is my FAVE!  Now the sauces are made from scratch, too.    Yummmmmm!  Go apple slices!!  PS:  finally tried the shattered chips mmmmmmm!  And Keegan, our server, is an absolute doll & adorably awesome!!!  @ingostastyfood"}
{"text":"Neat little place.  Dog friendly. Cheeseburger very good; however you have to update one dollar to get better grass fed beef. Prices are so reasonable, why bother with the lower grade stuff?  Wife's salad was on warm plate which should have been chilled -greens were wilted and not as fresh as they were expected to be. Not quite Postino quality, but we will return and hope for improvement."}
{"text":"Quick and easy take out spot.  Definitely try the shattered fries."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a beautiful building designed by Will Bruder Architects. They did a wonderful job designing a building that fits in perfectly with the fabric and character of the area. The site layout and landscaping is neat too, though parking is a bit sparse. Except for when it's brutally hot outside, their patio is amazing. Seating inside is pretty limited. Service is friendly and efficient. Our meals have always been really good, but not necessarily out of this world. The chips and veggie burger are close though. Prices are a bit steep for the portion sizes. Overall, a very solid option with a lot of character."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place to go. I've never seen a restaurant like this. I recommend the French fries! We got the fries and they were so good. They came with two different dipping sauces and they went nicely with the chips. The food is very fresh and the people there are very nice. I definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Loved this little place. There is not a ton of seating, but the patio has a great feel to it.  We both had the Paris Texas Burger and it was delicious.  We also have the homemade potato chips which are more like slices of potato deep fried.  The food was wonderful and the service was excellent.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night, my two toddler daughters and I stopped by this sister restaurant to next door LGO. It's a cozy little spot, reminiscent of the classic bell ringing diner where your waitress stands in front of you at a counter pouring a fresh cup of coffee and the chef is behind the grill cooking away, but in a totally updated and refined way. The menu is simple classic American but with a twist and every entree is delicious! I commented to my wife at home that the chicken sandwich is the best I've ever had! Who would think to put a thinly sliced green apple and pickle in a superbly fried crispy chicken sandwich. The resulting balance is culinary perfection even if it's something so simple. Try it out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS!   I had the Ingo cheese burger, my wife had the chicken sandwich and we split an order of the chips. My burger was amazing. The service was phenomenal. Our server was very well informed and was able to answer all my questions without hesitation. The beef in my burger was made will all natural, grass fed beef and it really makes a difference. It has been a long time since I have had such a great burger!   All in all this place is great and I cannot wait to go back with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Yummo burger! I read the one review that didn't give the place high marks... well maybe they didn't get the cheeseburger or they are taking crazy pills as I am a connoisseur of cheese burgers. Now I will say- my fav. in the valley is Matt's Big Breakfast Butter Burger... Ingo's is a different kind of burger as this is a super cool food stand and not a retro diner. What they have in common is AMAZING BEEF and CHEDDAR! So if you love great quality rancher's beef and yummy gooey cheese on a delightfully simple bun- go now to this place before others find it."}
{"text":"This little corner of Campbell and 40th Street in Arcadia should be called , 'fun foodie corner'! LGO has once again added a new place and it pleases on the more healthy simple side of the palette. Recently, I used a gift cert I had to try it out during a great winter day in Phoenix.. meaning, not the typical 'winter day' of anywhere else; The sun was shining and the birds were happily chirping as we were not under three feet of snow like other parts of the US. Ahhh us lucky Arizonians! We get to lunch in the winters on a sunlit patio.. and Ingo's has a great one! Colorful little tables adorn this picnic patio under the trees and on the corner for watching the life of whatever pass by. The menu is simple, as is the food. The special of the day is brought to you on a sticky note and thats cute. Clean and pretty healthy choices await you here at Ingo's. But if you're anything like me.. I can order everything healthy and then SOMEONE at my table inevitably will get the splurge factor involved that I can not resist. In this case and on this day it was the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips! Soo, so tasty! They are not 'chips' in the sense of being thin .. they are hand cut potatoes and a little thick with just enough sea salt and Ingo's hot sauce , (and yes, IT's HOT!(, or a creamy dipping sauce on the side. Too yummy for words! Completely shareable! We shared the Toni's Deviled Eggs that say they have goat cheese per the menu.. they were super good! I just don't know if I can say I actually tasted goat cheese. I also had the White Fish Club Sandwich.. and if you have read my reviews before, being from the bay area and growing up as the ocean as my back yard, I always ask if the fish is fresh. She assured me it was and I can attest that it tasted very fresh! I did the fish grilled versus fried and it was tasty! The sauce was amazing and made the sandwich very good! A decent serving at that! I also did a small Kale and Quinoa Salad.. YUM! The right amount of lemon sets the greens, grapes and red peppers offset with a smattering of parmesan, manchego cheeses and sunflower seeds into a spin for your tastebuds in this very healthy salad. I can see myself grabbing one of these to-go in large to fly with! Ingo's has housemade sangrias; cocktails; craft beers and LGO's own red and white wine. This was a 'school day' for me so no libations but Ingo's could be the perfect place for having cocktails on this great patio. They also have curbside service for 'to go' orders! In all of my years of living in the valley, not one LGO concept has disappointed me and Ingo's, by no surprise, did not either. I truly loved it.. a healthy, simple concept with clean ingredients! I only came in with 4 stars versus 5 on this review for the girl lacking in her energy in serving us.. I could not tell if she just wasn't into us or her day or her job! She barely cracked a smile .. I get it, as I have days like that too. Usually a perk of espresso makes me forget my woes for the time though! Nonetheless, nothing else could possibly have been wrong with Ingo's ! Can't wait to come back and hang out on the patio with sangria in hand!"}
{"text":"Charming patio scene with gorgeous cafe lights that screams adorable! I love the relaxed vibe and trendy staff.   My girlfriends and I came here around 7pm on a weekday and were able to sit down right away. We ordered some vino and the shattered potato chips (I think that's what it's called)....sooooo good! Perfectly sliced potatoes with an amazing sour cream / dill dip which was lip-smacking good. For dinner I had the chicken Sammy and shared the kale/quinoa salad with my amigas.   The chicken Sammy was a fried chicken sandwich with a zippy sauce that was so flavorful. As for the kale salad, I hesitated a bit because I'm not one to enjoy kale (I hope to get there in my life). This salad was amazing!!!!! There were grapes in the salad which gave it a sweet something something. I need to figure out how to copy this salad because it's packed with superfoods.   For dessert we had the salted caramel ice cream sandwich which was sooooo good!! And to mention, if you don't get dessert go hit up their free 99 cookie table.   Definitely check out this restaurant for a fresh twist on american food."}
{"text":"Am I missing something?  I've been here three times, and I just don't get why people like this place so much. In an area that's as saturated with restaurants as Arcadia is, Ingo's is nothing special.  The funky building architecture and the \"is it plastic or is it glass?\" wine cups are far more interesting than the actual food.  If you want a good burger, go to The Grind or The Stand, which are both nearby and WAY WAY better."}
{"text":"Love the patio seating, the service was great. I ordered the crispy chicken sammy which was delicious. I loved these apple slices on the sandwich, it went great with the pickles. The shattered chips were excellent. Next time I'll be trying a burger."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Paris Texas Burger with their homemade chips. To die for!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Came here on Saturday evening around 7:00 & had a slight wait. So nice to sit out on the patio & enjoy great food & weather. We had a drink to start off called the Greyhound so excellent if u like grapefruit and the avocado toast as an appetizer  (so delicious). I ordered the veggie burger & it did not disappoint. We also had the fried potatoes with a sour cream dill sauce & green salsa.  So glad we were told to try this awesome place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! just absolutely amazing. I am an employee of La Grande Orange and I had never been to Ingo's. tried it out today for the first time!   I had the farmer's daughter with the cashew veggie patty. it had so much flavor and was overall a complete home run! The shattered potato chips were delicious too! And to top it all off the Flower Child was incredible. So well-balanced, refreshing, and I am a huge fan of the Frida Kahlo Tequila used by LGO and Ingo's. mmm!   My friend had the tuna Burger and it was very tasty as well. Great job guys! love that this company takes such great care of their guests, and employees. plus there's so much thought, love, and care put into the food!!!"}
{"text":"I come here for the Happy Hour greyhounds, but stay for the delish cheeseburgers and fun atmosphere. The best part of living in AZ is eating on the patio, and they have one of the best. But even when the warmer temps drive us indoors(although they do have misters), we enjoy ourselves. The food is reasonably priced! Troy is an awesome server, very attentive and knows how to anticipate our every need and offers awesome suggestions.  We have never had bad service here! When you are in Arcadia, make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect burger. The meat is amazing. High quality and cooked just right. The types of burgers are nothing fancy... They don't need to be the actual burger is that good. I'm a low carb gal but I have had the burger with the bun and it is fantastic. You'll be happy with any of the choices. I also love the watermelon salad. The complimentary oatmeal chocolate chip mini cookies is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Just simply delicious. I decided to try Ingo for the first time tonight after driving past it numerous times and seeing their awesome reviews. They definitely didn't let me down. I ordered in so I went through the curbside pick up. It's a small parking lot and I had to wait for others to get their food first even though they said 8-10 minutes. Anyways... I had the whitefish sandwich and the shattered potato chips. Sooooo good! The sandwich was very fresh, I just needed more sauce and I was given a generous amount of potatoes. I plan on returning and hope to become a regular."}
{"text":"Simple menu with choices for everyone. The deviled eggs were on point, and the rest of the menu is just as good. The atmosphere is comfortable and the music is appropriate for a patio dining experience.   This place makes the neighborhood nicer!"}
{"text":"Ingo's is a cool place! Small inside, but the patio is really cute and there's a lot of places to sit. I enjoyed the food I got a lot - we both had the Paris Texas Burgers with BBQ sauce and bacon. I was super hungry and it was delicious!  However, I had to rate this place a little lower because our service was so bad. It started out fine, and she was really attentive and quick with our drinks and taking our order. Once she gave us our food, though, she pretty much never looked at us again. We were still hungry after the burgers and wanted to get something else and another drink, but after waiting for 20 minutes we just put our card down to pay and left (it took her another 5-10 minutes to get our card). It would be one thing if they were super busy or if she was stuck in another area for a while, but she passed right by us SO many times and never glanced over or seemed to see us trying to get her attention. I would like to come back here because I liked the food, but I probably won't rush back after such a frustrating experience :/"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Ingo's sister restaurant LGO, than you're going to love Ingo's. Their burgers are reasonably priced, and incredibly delicious.  Their menu is small, yet they have unique entrees that will still make difficult to pick one.  Sitting is very limited as it's small location, but everyone is usually in-and-out due to the quick service. The only thing that I'm not the biggest fan of is their fries. Well they aren't even fries, they are chips. I want real fries, and I want ranch to dip them in. I know it sounds obnoxious, but there is nothing like having some thick cut fries with your burger. Besides that, the burgers are amazing. For all you vegans, make sure you get the black bean burger, but ASK for it on an English muffin as the regular bun is not vegan. Staff is really friendly. Make sure you plan ahead as parking can be tricky and time consuming."}
{"text":"Hands down the greatest veggie burger! My boyfriend an I come here a few times a month because it is so good! He says the chicken sammy is amazing. Make sure to grab a few cookies with your meal they are delicious! And a  greyhound to drink.  The patio is great to relax as the sun goes down. Heated in the winter and misters in the summer so it really is great all year long. We bring our dogs and the servers are so kind to them. We have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Every time we go to AZ, we go to Ingo's. This place can't be beat--burgers, sangria, and homemade chips. You gotta go!"}
{"text":"We sat at the counter indoors for our first time.  We weren't sure about the noise level outside and we like to watch chefs at work.  Traffic level/noise at 6PM on a Wednesday was pretty minimal, so we will sit outside on the patio next time.  Order the shattered potatoes with the jalapeño sauce!!!  Amazingly good and they make them fresh right in front of you.  The potatoes are served with a ridiculously addictive dipping sauce called 'lebni' (greek yoghurt, spices & something highly addictive).  The 'lebni' was so tasty that we ordered a side to take home and try on other things.  Regarding the jalapeno sauce, they puree the peppers, add a few things and then let it 'ferment' for a week.  Then they add vinegar and a few other things.  Minimal heat level, fantastic jalapeno flavor.  Happy Hour -- $3 for good beer (and wine)!  We ordered two Paris burgers medium rare (we feel that it's a shame to overcook high grade, grass fed beef).  The meat was perfectly cooked with just the right amount red.  Amazing apple bbq sauce -- we ordered a side to go with the potatoes.  For something semi-healthy, we ordered their salad special for the night -- watermelon, feta, mint and pistachios.  Absolute perfection for an August night in Phoenix.  The people next to us ordered the kale salad and the avocado toast, both of which looked awesome.  It was funny watching them 'go foodie' on vegetarian food in a burger place.  :)  Regarding dessert, they do ice cream sandwiches from LGO ... but they aren't on the menu ... and they are really GELATO!!!  I had the 'fresh' mint chocolate chip & my wife had the salted caramel.    We are converts.  :)"}
{"text":"Ingo's is absolutely amazing each and every time that I go! I always opt for the Paris Texas Burger, because it never fails to satisfy my burger craving. The potato chips are tasty and cooked perfectly with a little crisp. I've tried the deviled eggs, but wasn't too impressed. I wish they had a large selection of beer, wine, and drinks. :(   Burgers are the best, hands down. If you go, go for the burgers! They're mouth watering and they always recommend the burger to be cooked medium, which is the best way to have a burger, dah!"}
{"text":"Tried Ingo's for the first time today. Got the White Fish Club Sandwich with 1/2 order of fries and the housemade lemonade.  First off, the fish on the fish sandwich was perfect and very moist & flaky. The dipping sauces with the fries are amazing, especially the jalapeno one.  Lastly, that's some of the best lemonade I've had since I was a kid. Really, tart, lots of pulp. Yum!"}
{"text":"A 12 ounce beer (minus 2 oz for the head) served in a plastic glass is a bit absurd.  Charging 5 dollars on top of it!?  More absurd.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We tried the new local burger bar by doing takeout. It was quick and the burgers were great. Love having a place that sells well sourced grass fed beef.  The only suggestion is that they should have more side options. Sweet potato fries would have been great."}
{"text":"First time at Ingo's! My bf and I went here for dinner  on Wednesday. We ordered the chips, deviled eggs and each had a burger  Chloe was amazing. She knew a lot about the company and menu choices!"}
{"text":"Tasty place to grab a bite while dining street side for people-watching and to enjoy days with beautiful weather. The homemade chips and dips are very savory. Prices are very reasonable. Staff is friendly. Dine during off-peak hours to avoid crowds. Make sure to grab a couple free sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out."}
{"text":"This was really, really good. The atmosphere is just right, the customer service is extremely nice, and the food exceptional. Really I can not find one thing wrong with this place, hence the five stars.  I ordered the Paris Taxes burger, and my wife got the special chicken and waffles. We ordered a side of \"chips\" on the side. The chips came out first, and they were like no chips that I have ever had before. Obviously house made, they were like tiny cuts of delicious potatoes with sour cream on top. They were very very good.  The burger was cooked medium rare and was very tasty. The house brewed tea that I ordered along with it was also very good. My wifes chicken and waffle was the bomb, seriously the best chicken and waffles ever!  Enough can not be said about the level of customer service. There was never a time when we felt neglected, nor did they hover. It was the right amount of attention. The manager even came out to check on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal.   This is a place I would highly recommend to anyone, try them out."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place today and I am so glad I did! This restaurant is tucked away in the corner of Campbell and 40th street. The outside patio is surrounded by trees so its shaded and really cute. You can definitely sit inside around the bar area. Okay, now let's move to the food. I ended up ordering shattered potatoes because literally everyone around me had a plate of these in front of them. I was not disappointed. They were delicious and paired well with the Ingo green sauce and lebne. I also got the veggie black bean burger, which I have to say is the best one I have had so far.  Definitely going back to try more stuff!"}
{"text":"This is a very small casual sleek MODERN gourmet burger joint that also offers cocktails and beers. You're most likely coming here for the insanely great grass fed beef burgers. I had a really terrific beef burger from here before so this time I tried the sushi grade ahi tuna burger. The chopped up tuna patty was held together with whole grain and seemed light as air. The patty was topped with buttery avocado for richness and that spicy sauce made the burger really delicious. I also liked that the bun didn't seem too big and was sturdy but also seemed light at the same time. We shared the non-traditional deviled eggs. They were really large and tasty with a little fresh dill and pretty pieces of beetroot. We also shared the shattered potato chips. They were crisp and some had soft centers. The chips came with jalapeño sauce and labne. The jalapeño sauce that came with the chips was very tasty and the Lebanese style yogurt cooled you down so things don't get too spicy. When you're done they offer you complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies.   The help were extremely helpful and friendly.  The restaurant is hospital-like sparkling clean.   They offer a small dog friendly patio.  Parking lot is small.  A complimentary valet is located across the street.  High quality ingredients prepared to perfection with Great Service in a pristine clean environment deserves 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Potato fries Good . I got tuna burger. Not good I expected a tuna burger with fish filet but got lots of fillers with a few bits of fish. I took a bite of my hubbies burger and it's very  overpriced and nothing to write home about. Go to in and out burger and save your money."}
{"text":"The hamburger is pretty good(ch3ese burger, a bit on the smaller side).  The house potato chips with garlic is great also.  Overall a good eat for lunch."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try the tuna burger, unfortunately it wasn't available.  Paris burger was an excellent substitute. I also ordered the fries/chips. The sourcreme paired well with the fries/chips. The server was friendly and quick.  Music and ambiance were great, wish there was more seating inside."}
{"text":"We had lunch here this weekend and the food was pretty good. I was not impressed with the service tho.  Our server actually gave us a $7off coupon to use because she said she was 'not up to par' today without us even saying anything or complaining. That was nice of her, and unexpected.   The ambiance was great and we sat on the patio. I love the fact that the restaurant is off the beaten path. We will definatly try it again."}
{"text":"Easily the best burgers coming out of a cylindrically shaped building in all of Phoenix.  The grass fed beef is spot on juicy and the accompanying ingredients are unique and an ideal complement to the meat.  Now if only the LGO family could take a step back and learn how to build a parking lot."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, outdoor seating with the perfect amount of sun & shade with a stellar happy hour drink menu.  We had the shattered fries, a black bean burger and quinoa salad. The shattered fries win every time."}
{"text":"This place is so freakin' magical. Tonight Dema and Sunna were amazing - they hooked it up! The kitchen killed it, per usual. The spinach salad (post it special - so cute & clever), cheeseburger, deviled eggs and potato chips, literally changed my life. No. Seriously. There is so much love and good energy in this food.   Oh...and that patio? It's a little escape in the middle of the concrete jungle. Great music. Great atmosphere. The little string lights? Forgettaboutit!!!   My boyfriend and I will definitely be back. We will definitely be telling all of our friends and family. We might be your biggest fans."}
{"text":"I visited Ingo's this weekend (twice) and have to say they now have a little place in my heart. I absolutely love this little neighborhood joint.  On Saturday I stopped in on a whim and sat at the indoor counter solo. I ordered the tuna burger- wasn't a fan so I then ordered a cheeseburger. The tuna burger was interesting but the texture was odd. Why still 5 stars? Because the grass-fed beef burger was heaven in a bun! I'm talking melt in your mouth deliciousness! I kind of wanted dessert and Laura (I believe she's the manager) talked me into the ice cream sandwich. She told me it would change my life. Well she wasn't joking this salted Carmel ice cream sandwich gave me life!! It has sugar cookies on each side and I was told they add more cream cheese and butter to the cookies so they don't fully freeze. I'm sure that means more calories, but who cares it's totally worth it!  Well I was so impressed that I brought my friend in on Sunday and we sat outside. Let me point out that we received full service outside after we seated ourselves- we did not order from the window. I got the crispy chicken sandwich this time and O...M...G!!! It's even better than the burger I would have rated 5 stars!!! How did this happen?! It had apples, pickle and a sriracha mayo on it. It sounds odd, but take my word for it finding a chicken sandwich better than this will for sure be difficult! I also enjoyed the shattered potato chips. They come with a dipping sauce- no idea what it is but it's pretty good. They also have this house-made jalapeño hot sauce that is awesome on the potatoes and has a nice clean fiery kick! If you like spicy food be sure to ask for it as it's not something that automatically comes with your order.  Lastly, another reason they get 5 stars is because the service is amazing! I had conversations with Dom the executive chef and Laura and both were so extremely friendly and welcoming. Along with the friendliness, there's also some serious eye candy working in there which is never a bad thing! ;)"}
{"text":"My first time here. Great coffee, awesome atmosphere, and super friendly staff. You don't need to be a hipster to enjoy this place. Will definitely come back for lunch and hh"}
{"text":"The food, outside patio, and service here is awesome! We started with the homemade potato chips with lebin...and I'm addicted.  I have been craving them since we went yesterday.  I ordered the Tuna Burger, which was sushi grade tune with a light bun and other dressings.  It was delicious and very light. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little spot with healthy, yummy food at great prices (for reasonable portions, all a la carte).  They call it a gourmet food stand which is basically a healthy, quick little burger-type joint, with beer, wine and lemonade.  My husband and I split the tuna and veggie burgers, both of which tasted healthy and delicious.  The ground tuna is mixed with bulgur wheat and topped with lots of avocado, and the veggie burger is a fresh mix of neat stuff - veggies, cashews, brown rice.  I do plan to ask for tomatoes on the tuna sandwich, next time.  Note: the portions are on the small side.  I personally love a place that serves the amount I'd like to eat and charges accordingly, but it's good to know.  There are tables inside and outside this small, circular restaurant - it looks delightfully swanky but it's totally casual.  If you're in the mood to grab and go,  there are several convenient to-go parking spaces, a dedicated pick-up window and super quick food.    After hiking Camelback, it's a great close place to stop to eat something yummy that doesn't negate your fitness efforts."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time with my wife and son.  Excellent!!!  We all had the cheeseburgers and special fries (2 portions was enough for the 3 of us).  Everything was brilliant.  I even had caramelised onions for no extra charge and they were delicious.  Service was outstanding, as was the quality of the food.  Other food that we saw being served also looked yummy!  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best veggie burger I've ever had. My boyfriend got a regular burger and really enjoyed it too :P  We also tried the deviled eggs which were pretty good too. They were made with goat cheese and mustard and topped with pickled beets !"}
{"text":"Tiny place, tiny parking spots, tiny portions. But, place is worth a try. Ordered -  Black bean burger with cheddar : tasted really fresh and yummy. Tiny burger like I said before. Potato chips : its worth a special mention. Chips are  deep fried but not completely fried. Like weird but tasted amazing with the green dip.  Amazing ambience and music. Not really sure about the groups. Totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not my favorite burger in town.  The style of this restaurant and outdoor seating makes this place draw you in.  Had to the burgers back to be refired a bit, hadn't complained about it but the manager came out and apologized and gave us a coupon for $15 for our next visit just for the inconvenience of having to wait for the burgers....I like a place that takes care of its customers!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. Across the street from La Grande Orange and Postino's Arcadia, this place almost feels like it's inside a tree. The patio is covered in sagging trees giving it a super cozy feeling.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich that came with a spicy mayo and thinly sliced green apples. We also shared 3 baskets of the Chips (crispy potatoes) that were pretty incredible. I haven't had anything like that before and was pretty blown away.  Our waitress was super focused, patient and knowledgeable about the menu. She explained each question and dish in detail, and was quick to pick up our plates as soon as we finished. Even the girl behind the bar was super friendly and chill. The place was quiet as we went in after happy hour ended. It was a perfect girl's night!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot to go and grab a delicious burger at when I'm in my neck of the wood. They just came out with The Avocado Toast! Try that before your entree and you will remember me...boy is that delicious!!! The manager is always around and very friendly, always meeting and greeting the customers. The staff is friendly and happy to work here, you can tell. Now, this will definitely make me be a regular here; that's what a good customer experience is all about, and we as customer love to be treated right :)"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich and fish sandwich. Oh and those chips are just so mouthwatering. You'll have issues parking most likely because it's a super small parking lot, but they do have overflow which is nice - short walk away. Love walking or riding bikes over to eat! The patio is adorable and super pleasant."}
{"text":"Great imaginative menu items and efficient ordering system!  Ingo's Tasty Food is an instant classic!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint! Excellent service and chill patio. Inside seating is limited and there's no wifi (although if you sit on the west side of the patio you can lift it from their sister restaurant LGO). If you order your burger medium rare you ACTUALLY get it medium rare. Very #rare. Extra parking a block down on 40th st."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taking me this long to write this review, but better late than never!   Listen to whatever others day and try the egg salad, but show up between 11 and 12 because they only offer it during that short hour. Even if you think, \"I don't even like egg salad,\" still get it. I was one of those... \"but I don't even like egg salad\" people and then I tried their version and was blown away. This isn't your typical egg salad sandwich. If they didn't put mayo on it, I would almost call it a breakfast sandwich with a twist. The eggs are cooked fresh for each order and they are combined with their delicious mayo sauce and placed on crispy yet fluffy bread. Make sure you order it with the pancetta if you like a little meat. It's crispy and salty and yummy!  Besides the egg salad, I have also enjoyed the tuna sandwich and cheeseburger. I was pleasantly surprised with the tuna sandwich because it was crispy and accompanied by an aoili and avocado. I don't typically order tuna but I was glad I switched my routine. The cheeseburger had the delicious LGO touch and the meat was perfectly cooked. You really can't go wrong with any food here. The Kale salad is a great side to accompany the meal. I only wish they had french fries on the menu. Their homemade chips are delicious but I am more of a french fries kind of girl.  This is a great location to enjoy lunch on the patio, but if it's too hot, then you can sit inside and watch them make your food which is really fun! They also have a walk-up window where you can place an order to go.   If you can't find parking, head north on 40th street and follow the signs to additional LGO parking."}
{"text":"Amazing. The three of us had about 24 hours in Phoenix and are self-declared foodies. When my sister found Ingo's we decided to check it out. We were already excited by the architecture. Then once we got even more excited once we saw the food coming out of the kitchen. We ordered the potato chips with labne, deviled eggs, rice bowl and the tuna burger. It was all, like I said, amazing. The tuna burger lacking in flavor but with the jalapeño salsa it got better. The rice bowl and the potato chips were the real winners. Plus the complementary cookies at the end were delicious, chocolate chip with sea salt flakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"Positives: Shattered potato chips with lebni dipping sauce. Wow. Deviled Eggs. Wow. Pretty good beers on happy hour.   Negatives: Honestly wasnt too big of a fan of the burger or the chicken sandwich. A little bit of a letdown but the 4 stars is mainly for the appetizers.   Will return simply for the shattered potatoes and lebni."}
{"text":"I've been here three times previously and always had the chicken sandwich which we all know is amongst the best in town. But on my stop by the takeout window today at noon I knew I wanted something different and told the young lady working the counter (wish I'd asked her name so I could acknowledge her...cute brunette...ponytail I think). Rather than give the \"everything is amazing\" line that annoys the crap out of me she recommended a single item that she thought I would like, the Paris burger. She even gave me a food hack to ask for the next time I'm there (chicken sandwich with Paris burger toppings). I got home, devoured the delicious burger (I'm not normally a grass fed guy) and am already thinking about the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings she recommended. Kudos to Ingo for truly tasty food and also for such a great staff of friendly and knowledge people. They make the food even tastier...especially for people like me who score atmosphere and energy of a place right up alongside the food.  The Stand may have the best overall burger in Acadia/Arizona/America? but for the complete package, Ingo's Tasty Food can't be beat."}
{"text":"Can you say amazing!? I only get the fish sandwich when I go here but it is a damn good sandwich! One of the best fish sandwiches you'll find in this city. The shattered chips with the green sauce and the white dip!!! Omg! Glad my mom lives in another state because it's so good I wanted to slap her! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Cool little hipster joint. Food is good and they had a few beer taps. Good place to go if you want to get in and out in a hurry. Deviled eggs are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food and great happy hour prices, with a few downsides:  Parking is not easy especially if you are unfamiliar with the neighborhood.  When paying with a credit card, the minimum tip was 18%. (note to self:  pay tip in cash).  My friend and I both shared the fish and chicken sandwiches - chicken wins as it stayed together and was more flavorful with the apple.  The fish fell apart and was a mess.  The potato chips were outstanding and flavored nicely."}
{"text":"I love Ingo's. (Little sister to another fave across the street, La Grande Orange). Ingo's is very small and cozy, but has a wonderful wrap around patio that's great for people watching, and also dog friendly.  The menu here is limited, but don't let that deter you. Ingo's is a little gourmet burger joint specializing in grass fed beef. The burgers are simply amazing. They are recommended cooked medium pink, which is really the best way to eat them . They're also available in two sizes...petite (3 oz) and regular (5 oz.). Do yourself a favor and get the regular. Otherwise you may be ordering two burgers, not just because they're small, but because they're that good! The other thing not to miss are the shattered potato chips served with Lebni ( a Greek yogurt sauce) and pickled jalapeño sauce. Sounds weird, but it's so delicious, especially mixed together! For libations they feature LGO's famous white sangria, and a wonderful Greyhound.  Good stuff. Check it out."}
{"text":"From the second I walked through the door it was an amazing experience! Tara took such good care of me as well as the other employees ;-) Looking forward to telling all my friends about this place . My veggie burger was so yummy+ complimentary cookies! Way to go team, friendly happy atmosphere!!  You have gotta stop in, to try the deviled eggs. Happy dining~~"}
{"text":"This place is really cool! Stopped by to get food to go. Didn't realize they will serve you curbside and I like walked up to the window haha. I had no idea though! I got the veggie burger as my meal. It took quite a while to be prepared and it was kind of pricey to not come with a side. Otherwise really good though! Sometimes I find myself having to dunk veggie burgers in ketchup because there's not enough sauce on it, but this was just right! The spread had a delicious kick to it. Also I love pickles on the side but usually can't stand them on a veggie burger. I forgot to ask for my burger without pickles on it, but the pickles on it were actually really tasty! I'd really like to come back, the avocado toast looked yummy too."}
{"text":"This place was really surprising. A coworker and I went to lunch not expecting anything spectacular and were we surprised. The potatoe chips were mandalined seasons great and fried amazing. He got the classic cheese burger and I got the Paris Texas burger. One of our new favorite burger places. Very simplistic but that was the beauty of it, was incredibly delicious. We will both definitely go back and try more. Everything was reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Well, last time we came here, about 8 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars easily. Great burgers, everything was grass-fed beef, great happy hour prices, great atmosphere. Today, we came here after eagerly anticipating Ingo's, and it was disappointing. Now, it's $1.00 extra for grass-fed beef, and we were totally rushed by the waitress. We wanted to relax, have a few drinks, then order, but we were continually pestered to order, even though there were a ton of empty tables. We had the shattered fries, which were far greasier than usual, and we had the Farmer's Daughter burger and the Paris, Texas burger. Neither burger was worth writing home about. After 2 drinks and our burgers, our waitress just came and placed the bill on our table without even asking us if we wanted anything else. Totally killed the experience.  Food... Not nearly as good as it used to be. Drinks.. Greyhound is great but is $8 Waitress? Terrible.  Unfortunately, we won't make the trip here again when there are far better places to enjoy a few drinks and food in a much better and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Burgers are high quality and the perfect size. Not too big not to small. The fractured chips are excellent, especially with the sauce that came with them and the jalapeño sauce. The Paris burger will set you free and I could do shots of the jalapeño sauce"}
{"text":"Overrated and over priced for what you get Good service but the veggie burger I had was mush and salty.   Zinburger far better."}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3 1/2 stars. I came here last night on a whim for dinner. The weather was perfect for sitting on the patio so we grabbed one of the few tables that were left and took a look at the menu. This place is small, and markets itself as a food stand with table seating. I didn't get a chance to look inside but the patio was cute and relaxing. Tables were a little tight but I enjoyed listening to our neighbors on what appeared to be a 1st tinder date.   For a drink I went with the Ingo's greyhound and my date had a Moscow mule. I ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and they came right away. Almost too fast, and as some others have stated they were pretty heavy on the mustard. For my taste there was also a little bit too much yolk per bite. We also got the potato chips which were pretty dang tasty. They were served with two dipping sauces, one was sour cream-based and the other was a weird green hot sauce. The hot sauce was good but it didn't seem to go well with the chips.   Just an FYI the menu is pretty limited, but done well. For entrées we ordered the cheeseburger and fish sandwich. My cheeseburger came out perfect medium pink and the poppyseed bun was to die for! The pickles were crunchy and overall it was a solid burger. The real stand out for me though was the fish sandwich. Lightly battered and fried, served with tangy tartar sauce and that amazing bun. The breading on the fish was very light but also very filling (and let's be real fried fish is way better than grilled).   In short, good food, service, and drinks. Not blow your mind amazing but I would recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hiking at the nearby mountain, I was hungry. Chatting with a couple of hikers on a trail and they recommended this place.  A quick glance on Yelp reviews, I wanted to try all. They all look so tasty. I ended up trying a cheeseburger. Added $1 to grass fed beef and ordered my burger medium rare. First bite of my burger, I tasted a soft bread and very good meat blended perfectly. It was a bit small for my appetite, I was still hungry after I finished eating.  I also liked yogurt base dip for their shattered potato chips. Deep fried potato went well with this dip as well as fermented jalapeño peppers sauce. I added sauce to my burger too.  Really liked the ambiance. This place is set up to cater only small group at a time. I like their round shape counter. In a warm day, I would like to come back to enjoy my meals on their patio.  They are so close to both Camelback and Piestewa peak hike. Perfect place to eat after good hike.   I would like to come back and eventually try all on the menu."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. A burger is a burger is a burger. You can get somewhat creative but at the end of the day, it's still a burger. So there's nothing particularly remarkable about the menu, on which burgers are the predominant item. Where the food does stand out though is the freshness and preparation: grass-fed beef and fresh veggies. What made my visit worth it was the fresh shattered potato chips served with a side of tart, creamy lebni. So highest marks for being creative with potatoes!!!!  The menu also has a few sandwiches and salads plus beer, wine and sangria. I REALLY hope that they start serving breakfast because it would be a great place to start the day. It's tiny but cheerful.....like a small diner complete with a circular counter around the open kitchen with some outdoor seating. Everyone working there is very friendly and light-hearted and they play good music which all really make this an enjoyable place to eat. I can imagine having brekky here with the morning sun coming in. (hint, hint, LGO!)  Parking is limited so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken & waffles! This dish is only available on the weekends. It was AMAZING! We will definitely be going back. There isn't a lot of parking at the location, but there is additional parking right around the corner, which was really nice! The service was excellent. The waitresses are on top of it! All-in-all this is a great little spot!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Haven't had a disappointing dish yet!  I usually go with the Texas burger because that is consistently good. Along with their fries and outdoor patio, it is an awesome experience. I also had the pleasure of ordering egg salad on their English muffins which is probably the best item on their menu. Too bad they only serve it for an hour each day. So you gotta get there at a specific time.  Nice waitresses and they do a lot to make sure you are having a great meal. Totally recommend this place for it's quiet neighborhood, great food and the convenience of going across the street for dessert and drinks at the market and bakery... who is also own by the same company."}
{"text":"Ingo's is a little gem, small portions that reflect in the pricing for very hip(ster) and happening Midtown Phoenix area.  Why go there:  It's a great spot for a light lunch or brunch.  If you are the kind of people who love to try different things, smaller plates to experience a few tastes, this is your kind of place.  Their bread is baked right across the street and so are the cookies.    Don't miss: The little burgers are excellent, these little tasty buggers pack a punch of flavor and so do the homemade chips...  The Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookies are worth buying, they tempt you with a free sample at the end of your meal.  Tips: Don't go for the big dishes, try a few things a la carte when you are there, follow your meal with the coffee from La Grande Orange across the way, their parent company."}
{"text":"we love Ingos. Our family and friends will be arriving soon and they always ask to go to Ingos great burgers, fish sandwiches, and salads....good drinks as well. we go there often and love the chips as well. every dish is good. good service as well."}
{"text":"Food coma has set it... I will keep this short. The food was on point and had they not cut me off, I would have been arrest for driving under the influence of grass fed bliss."}
{"text":"The service was fast and good! The burger was very good but not the best I've had in Phoenix! The fried potatoes were really good! I didn't care for the pita bread and humus! The pita was very dry and bland like they got the left overs from Postinos across the street!  It was a good experience overall"}
{"text":"I just can't seem to get enough of...Ingo's!!  I love Ingo's!! I am so happy that they offer grass fed beef, and the burger's are just super yummy.  My son loves the little cookie that comes in every bag and what better place to sit outside and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"This place was very mediocre for me. The best part of our meal was the potato crisp appetizer. I ordered a black bean burger that was not only incredibly bland but completely fell apart. I understand it's sometimes difficult to keep them together, but this was ridiculous.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich; it was good but very ordinary.  Everything just seemed so bland; just needed something extra.  Sorry, but I expected so much more."}
{"text":"We loved Ingo's! A group of three of us came here after hiking Camelback, so we were really ready for burgers. I enjoyed the Farmer's Daughter burger with bacon, and we all split the \"chips\" and deviled eggs. Everything was so fresh and flavorful, and I loved the flavor combination of the chips with the lebni + homemade hot sauce. They also had chocolate chip sea salt cookies that were way too delicious to even be real. I can't tell you how many cookies I ate, but I can tell you I'll be back!  Edited to add the service was great! Friendly and very helpful with giving us suggestions on what to order!"}
{"text":"Had my brother pick up Inga's take out a few days ago.   I actually didn't order anything myself but loved the few bites of chicken sandwich my mom had ordered. They have some really tasty spicy sauce on this sandwich, definitely suggest it.   The fries are a must! Next time I'll stop in and eat there :)"}
{"text":"This is a lil gem! Best patio seating for date night. They are known for their chips which were amazing with the recommended dip.   The burgers are also amazing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and it's always good. I'm an LGO group enthusiast. I love love love the kale and quinoa salad. So this time I added an angus burger as protein to the salad. So good. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. (I've had their burgers in the past and they are really good, worth a visit specifically for the burger). If you've never had the LGO group signature salad, it's got quinoa, dinosaur kale, grapes, sunflower seeds, and cheese (I want to say manchego) with lemon zest and a teensy bit of olive oil. It's so good, I crave it. Adding the burger to it was deeeeeelightful.  The hub had their crispy chicken Sammy. He loved the fresh bun and the lightly battered and fried chicken. They thinly sliced Granny Smiths on there, pickles (which the hubs removed), and a nice Sriracha aioli. He will be back for this.  We also ordered the shattered potato chips which live halfway between French fries and potato chips. Deep fried, out piping hot with a onion dip variation and salsa verde. So good. So naughty.  The kiddo \"enjoyed\" an excellent kids grilled cheese. She's just not a big eater but I tried it and it's a great grilled cheese. A nice hearty bread which is probably why she had a hard time with it. Comes with a couple shattered potato chips and a carrot. Of course she gobbles down the garnish. I do have to say that her lemonade was phenomenal. So fresh, tart, and perfectly sweet.   Good spot with happy hour from 11-7 M-F. Fair warning, if you order a sandwich, you get just a sandwich, albeit delicious, but there won't be a side with it unless you order it in addition."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. The  gin greyhound is to die for!! Happy hour could be the best prices in Phoenix. The wait staff is equally awesome! Defiantly will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had their chicken sandwich, was pretty good...nothing to special.Husband had the Paris burger, that was amazing! Service was great. Got to sit outside on the patio which was very peaceful. Ordered a Moscow mile during happy hour, was good...and they actually serve it in a all copper mug. Not the cheap stuff like most places do. A lot of really cool touches. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I finally came back to try the chicken Sammy and it was delicious! The fried chicken was super moist and crispy. I though it would be strange having the green apple with the pickle in the sandwich but they complimented each other really well. It was probably the best  chicken sandwich I have ever had.  My bf and my best friend both got the Texas burger and they really liked it. The burger seemed like it needed a crispy factor to it (there was bacon on it but the bacon wasn't crispy) but the flavors were all there. We also had the pistachio vanilla swirled soft serve. It was really good very light pistachio flavor that went well with the vanilla. The soft serve was not too sweet.   I do really like this place and would highly recommend everyone to try it."}
{"text":"I think Ingo's deserves 4.5 stars, but I'm holding off on 5 for now.  We came in on a Saturday, close to closing.  While many places act put off, we were never rushed and were given quite good service.  Thank you!  INGO's is located across from LGO and gives you another option if the waits are too long across the street.  We ordered the deviled eggs (yum!) and chips (also yum!) as appetizers.  Definitely get these starters - they rocked!  I had the kale/quinoa salad with a tuna patty.  Next time, I'd opt out of the fish addition, but this salad was quite tasty and will remind you of LGO's salad, if you've had that.  My friend ordered the brown rice bowl, which I would consider for next time.  Very rich and hearty.  I want to make these meals at home every day!  The boys got the white fish club sandwiches and were quite happy with their choices.  All food was devoured quickly!  We finished with ice cream cookie sandwiches.  Not the best desert ever, but a nice, sweet, finish.    We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ingo's is  home away from home. Cookies on the counter and you don't have to ask before you take one.. Or two. Good food that you come to think of as your own special something. Great vibe an the patio -even in July- without all the hassle. I heart into.  Must haves: chicken Sammie. Yes, it's that good. Chips are tdf (to die for). Veggie tray that comes with hummus could double as a centerpiece (if you're into that sort of thing). Greyhound with him though? Nah, had mine with vodka and enjoyed every bit of it. Love it, Will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what this corner needed, a cute little eatery for locals to enjoy, but I have a love hate feeling right now.  I was excited to hop up to the counter, but unfortunately the chairs do not move back and are too close to the counter and I slammed my knee pretty hard into counter wall while trying to sit at the counter, yep these seats were not made for those who are 6ft or taller, not comfortable at all, so I moved outside.  Good thing they have heaters, or this night would have been a flop.  Once we were seated outside, we were handed menu's, everything looks interesting.  To drink I had the coonawarra tea, which came in a cute little bottle with a glass & some ice.  I'm not even sure what coonawarra tea is, but it was good, I enjoyed it, the bottle rendered about 2  1/2 glasses, and I'm unsure if it is refillable bottle after that.  I ordered a side of shattered potato chips that comes with some sort of lemon spread dipping sauce, I was perplexed then as I am now, I can't honestly tell you if I liked them or if I didn't.  The shattered potato chips are fresh chips, but some are not chips just thick slices of potatoes, which this Irish girl loved and some were thinly sliced potatoes, I guess that's how they are shattered chips right? The chips were garnished with salt & pepper too. The lemon spread/dipping sauce that came with it, well that was unique, not sure if I liked it with the potatoes or not, but didn't stop trying it. haha. So conflicted I tell ya.  Also ordered the Paris Texas Burger, it was a Strauss family grass feed beef patty with apple bbq sauce, La Quercia pancetta, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato & dill pickle.  Now I loved this burger, the sharp contrast of flavors between the cheddar & pancetta and dill pickle just made this burger pop! I would for sure come back just for that burger!   They do have a walk up window so you can order your food to go, which is something I will consider next time.  It's a cute place, service is extremely friendly and the burger was delish!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town. Officially my favorite. Dema let me in late even though they were closed. Great customer service and great atmosphere. The two guys making the food were professional and nice as well. I suggest this place to anyone. Try the grass fed burgers. Can't go wrong here with the chips either. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"What a charming little spot. The food is freshly prepared while you wait and it's healthy and light and delicious. Great ventilation and interesting decor. The wrap around counter is really cool and a great use of space. Outdoor seating is great too. Very little parking available on site, but Ingos is worth the walk.  Please don't bring your small children here unless they are well behaved. This place is much too small for disturbances.   I highly recommend trying Ingos. If you are met with a long line or wait, please know if you wait, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"They never disappoint! Everything we've had here so far has been amazing every single time!"}
{"text":"I just love coming here. If you follow my reviews, you know how I am. If the vibe is right, I don't care what the price is. And that's how it is here. Every time I come, I love sitting out in the patio, enjoy my time in the sun (or not- as this time, the sun is blazing and of course the staff is considerate enough to move the umbrella so we are in full shade) and enjoy watching the traffic drive by. This time my friend had the spinach apple salad and I had the bison goat cheese salad.  The portion was just right, both were delicious esp the salad dressing for the spinach apple salad! The owners of LGO somehow has the magic 8 ball dailed into the right frequency to create an ever lasting environment each time. When I am sitting out on the patio enjoying my food and drinks, I feel transported to a space and time that is of the moment not connected to any human created contraption such as the clock. For the duration, there is just enjoyment."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place then a friend suggested it for happy hour so we went and I'm glad we did. The food was awesome! Lots of healthy things to choose from and good drinks. I got the deviled eggs which were probably the best I've ever had. I'm not typically a huge devil egg fan but I was intrigued when I saw they had goat's cheese and pickled beets, they were cheap enough to I figured what the heck. I also got the kale and quinoa salad which was great, super fresh."}
{"text":"We love the chicken sandwich with the slices of apple to die for and oh so very good. We heard amazing things about this place so we decided to try it and it will not disappoint! The chicken sandwich is really lightly breaded and just the texture and taste will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Last two experiences I've had at Ingo's  1) ordered curb side waited the ten minutes, went to pick up food, sat there for 15 minutes, decided to get out and see what's up, the guy that was taking to the person in the car next to me for the last ten minutes says \"oh, I didn't know this was yours, it's been ready for a while\".... I was in a hurry so I was mad, rightfully. I ordered from Ingo's this day for the curbside experience and didn't even have time to eat.   2) just now, order my go-to, better curbside experience, chicken is too dry to eat.   I WAS eating here three times a week (see my previous review ... 4 stars) but lately there has been no attention to detail and the food is either too salty or I guess now, over cooked.    Moving on.    Old review......   My husband and I just moved down the street from Ingo's and eat here often. It's really good, when it's really good. But sometimes it's entirely too salty.   He loves the fried chicken sandwich and I'm obsessed with their kale salad. I go back and forth on the fish, burger patty and the chicken.   I recommend the chicken but ask for light salt!   They also have an option for a grass-fed patty which is a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Burgers cooked perfectly (Medium rare, as I requested), egg salad with pancetta was out of this world, and the service was great! We will be telling everyone to come here! I bet if they wanted to, they would make amazing fries, but their burgers did it for me! :) thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes while waiters passed by chatting to a group of girls at the only other occupied table at the \"restaurant\". They couldn't even get the water right. There was yellow crust inside all of the cups like someone had pissed in the cup and left it for weeks. Total waste of my time on my birthday. Will never go back. If I could give less than a star I would."}
{"text":"Seat yourself kinda place. Very cozy. Came here for the Paris Texas burger...My boyfriend is actually from Paris,Tx lol.  Nothing to rave about. The meat was good quality...The whole burger itself lacked in much flavor. Boyfriends Greyhound was not really strong but I enjoyed my mule.  The 3 stars went for the ambience. :)"}
{"text":"The black bean burger is amazing! Shattered potato chips with lacto-fermented jalapeño hot sauce and lebni (Greek yogurt sauce) is addictive!"}
{"text":"Had a delcious beet salad with the \"Ingo's\" lightly battered chicken delight, the perfect combo to go with the \"shattered potato chips\"  I just love Ingo's, always consistant, always tasty..."}
{"text":"Omg. This place leaves me speechless!! Ordered it one night through postmates and fell in love. I ordered the farmers daughter burger and husband got the chicken schnitzel sandwich. Flavor was phenomenal!! Never had chicken schnitzel before but I loved it!! Everything that was in that sandwich was honestly just perfection. The farmers daughter sandwich was just as phenomenal. I wasn't sure if I would like the sauerkraut on it but am so glad I just got it anyways!! Loved every single bite. After having it at home I had to check this place out in person. Hubby and I brought the pups and the waitress promptly brought out a water bowl for them. Service was great which tops everything off. This time I tried the Paris Texas burger and it was so good! I still think the chicken burger and the farmers daughter burger are my top favorites right now but I can't wait to get back to try everything else!! Oh and if you want to have the best chocolate chip cookies they have those here too!! Idk what it is about them. Can't say enough good things. Bottom line, if you're looking for some bomb food at very decent prices, come here!"}
{"text":"Amazing trendy atmosphere!  Fantastic burgers, loved the Veggie platter and FREE cookies!!"}
{"text":"We live across the street and last night my daughter and I went to dinner. As always the food was amazing (the chips are always our favorite) and our service was great. The gal who served us was our server when we brought my parents there months ago and she even remembers that time. Even if we didn't live across the street I would still frequent here. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Very good burger and fish sandwich. Excellent home cooked potato crisps. Wonderful service. Outstanding, and we mean outstanding music - the proprietor of this restaurant is world class, and knows music and how to mix music, and that is an understatement!"}
{"text":"I dined in at Ingos for happy hour the other night. I asked the waitress to explain the happy hour and she said 2$ off any drink. We ordered the frozen lemonade. When we received the bill, the lemonade remained at full price. We asked the manager, Arzu [sp], why the lemonade was not reduced. She responded that it was already at happy hour price and that it was \"hard to explain\". When we told her our server told us all drinks were 2$ off, she said \"oh she must not know.\" She did not apologize for the poor communication, nor do anything to resolve the situation. She brushed it off and ignored us the rest of the evening. We had to flag down our original server to pay and received no further explanation. Very disappointed with the poor service, poor communication, and no attempt to resolve the issue."}
{"text":"Delicious and creative food! The veggie burger, orange and fennel salad, and smashed potatoes are all SO GOOD! I also really enjoyed the greyhound. Now that is a refreshing cocktail!   The service is great and the patio is perfect. With the misters on, it feels like a little shangri-la in the middle of the city :)"}
{"text":"Good food and ambience in great neighborhood. Big drawback is that they use throw-away plastic plates, cups and utensils. Needlessly wasteful, can't wholeheartedly recommend because of that. For a brand new place, you'd think they'd be more thoughtful in their design."}
{"text":"Really good Paris Texas burger. The burgers are not cheap but you can definitely taste the quality."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review after getting an email asking for an opportunity to come back in, and am upping my review to 4 stars! I really do enjoy walking there with my bf and our pup and hanging on the patio. They put cement down on the patio where it used to be dirt, and it makes a big difference! The service is always on point and the food is really good. The chicken Sammy and quinoa salad are bomb, and I love the white sangria - super refreshing on a warm day. Only reason why I'm not giving five stars is because I still think the servings are too small for what you're paying. Today I grabbed the salad with chicken and the avocado toast. The total was $21 for a small (but delicious!) salad and one piece of toast with avocado, tomato and mozzarella. Again, very good but a super small serving. Will I be back? Absolutely! But I may forgo grabbing a drink to make up for the food price. Thanks Ingo's, enjoy having you in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try INGO'S since we eat across the street  when we come to Arizona. It always looks busy so we thought the food should be good. We waited about 5 min before our table was ready . Everyone working there seems to be nice but the Manager  went out of her way to Make us fell welcomed. She was so nice when  my wife couldn't decide between which drink to get . She recommends a drink to her and also brings her a sample of the drink she was thinking of getting .I would recommend INGO'S if you like burgers..thank you Erin for being so nice... We live in California but when we visit Arizona we will eat at INGO'S for sure."}
{"text":"I love being outside and taking in the sun. At Ingo's, you take in the sun. Most of the seating is outside save some bar seating indoors. It makes me wonder how much clientele they get during the vicious summer months...think heavy use of water-misters.   I also love the small, intimate feel to the place. It gives it character. At the same time, the surrounding area feels like a social dining experience with La Grande and Postino's on the other side of the street, so Ingo's doesn't feel alone and isolated.   I've had the Paris, Texas Burger and the White Fish Club Sandwich. Both are really good and I highly recommend. I would call it fine-dining of traditionally fast-food. One other thing I noticed is that the portions of the main dishes are a little small to what I''m used too, but I think that just means appetizers are in order.   Parking within the immediate area is limited, but more parking is available a block north and on the other side of the street. A nifty accessory they carry is a hanger, which is a rod that's about 3 feet off the ground, which is used to hang your bags on."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The service, drinks and food were great. I had a fish sandwich and the quinoa kale salad. No complaints."}
{"text":"I and my hubby had been to ingos we ordered paris texus burger and ingos cheese burger both were amazing very delicious."}
{"text":"This place is one of my neighborhood favorites. Great food, friendly staff, attentive service! I LOvE the chicken Sammy and the farmers daughter burger..."}
{"text":"The ingo burger- it has an interesting flavor especially with the fol epi. Fresh shattered potato chips with lebni- it was ok, but rather have fries Hummus & pumpkin seed dips- good  Free cookies in which they add salt- interesting flavor"}
{"text":"I went into Ingos with a friend this afternoon after passing by it countless times. I must say this place really blew me away! It's very very tiny you walk in and it's literally just a bar around the kitchen that seats maybe 15? I like the cozy feel and the servers are very attentive! We were in and out in about 30 minutes. Drinks came out immediately, the app came out super fast along with our entrees! I got the seasonal Rita, which was a frozen spiked lemonade with mint! It was so tasty. We started out with their shattered potato chips. They aren't normal chips but better. Almost a French fry feel. It came with a creamy dip and a spicy one, both were delicious. I got the black bean veggie burger it was to die for. You could tell all the ingredients are incredibly fresh. You literally watch the cook make it in front of you. The service was so friendly I can't wait to come back and bring friends!!"}
{"text":"Stand Up For Tasty Food!  Ingo's Tasty Food scores a big thumbs up for Trendy & Tasty. Awesome casual vibe with even better food.   The location's design and atmosphere set it apart from its surroundings. It has a nostalgic fresh off the grill, picnic in the state park kinda vibe, but with a modern twist, and killer music selection. But not too hipster... cause you know too many hipsters in one spot is just too much.  And say hi to Erin. She can make solid suggestions for you.  I had the Paris, Texas Burger and Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. Both cooked in front of me and to perfection. Paired nicely with Chardonnay to start and Cabernet Sauvignon with my meal.  If you like a little spice ask for the Homemade Lacto-Fermented Hot Sauce, made with only jalapeño, vinegar, garlic, and salt. Simple but super tasty with just the right kick.  Ingo's is a sister restaurant to Chelsea's Kitchen and la Grande Orange Pizzeria and Grocery, all within a few hundred yards of each other. Looks like this family of hot spots owned by Bob Lynn have it all figured out.  So great to find a small town favorite in a big city like the greater Phoenix area.  Don't miss it, and prepare to hang out, cause that's what your gonna want to do.  Finish the night with the Salted Caramel Gelato and Vanilla Cookie.  I'll be back.  Don't miss more reviews at my website elevationexpeditions.com."}
{"text":"Love love loved Ingo's, but will not be back. They no longer offer any vegan burger. So sad. :("}
{"text":"This is an awesome, casual concept. With its outdoor patio and modern cylindrical shape, this fancy food stand is not one to overlook.         Sitting down, we decided to split a bottle of wine (they have a nice selection!) and order their shattered chips that come with lebni sauce--it's lemony and yogurt-like. I could hardly resist eating them all in one go!          Dishes come out minimally with no frills or fuss. If you're looking for a special, their salad special is on a post it note. I decided to try their brown rice bowl and wasn't disappointed. Although the jalapeño was a little more fiery than I'd expected (which slowed me down a lot) the brown rice, pistachios and poached egg on top were a delicious combo!        My friend got one of their burgers and was incredibly impressed--this is my next thing to conquer on their menu!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the first night we tried Ingo's and we can't believe we never tried it before!!! We were greeted by a very kind staff and told to choose any seat, no wait at 8:00pm and they were just putting out candles on the tables outside! It was romantic, great music playing and our server came over right away! We started with the \"potato chips\" which are a delicious crispy mix between French fries and chips! It's served with their delicious homemade Greek yogurt sauce and hot sauce. Trust me, start with this is so good and perfect to share between two! The food menu is small but packed with unique flavors! I tried the chicken sandwich --it was nice and piping hot and super crispy! The sauce and apple combination with the sandwich are unbelievably good! My boyfriend has the fish sandwich \"Adam and Eve\" style (lettuce instead of bun)! I love bread but the fish sandwich was yummy with the lettuce--it didn't feel like you were missing out on the bread! Great atmosphere GREAT FOOD, amazing service! We'll be back for happy hour and dinner SOON! :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Laura for your generous gift certificate, yes I had lunch at Ingo's with my family members today and had such a great time! We loved the atmosphere, the restaurant theme, the service and the food!   I had white sangria of course and I also had kale and quinoa salad for lunch, it was yummy but I would recommend the chef to add raisins for the balance.  My hubby had bean burger and he said it was yummy as well. My brother and sister in law had the grass fed beef burger and they said it was amazing.  We shared the home-made potato chips and devil eggs, oh boy it was great. We loved everything, but my #1 fav was home-made potato chips with some short of white deep and the green salsa deep was a dope!   Larissa our waitress was so sweet, she gave us chocolate chip cookies with French sea salt as dessert compliment, it was amazing! We also had vanilla and chocolate swirled gelato, it was so smooth like silk melting in your mouth.  Thank you for your service Ingo's tasty food, you have the most friendly staffs ever!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks! Great service!! Love this place!! This is an awesome place to go grab a burger, it is so delicious you have to try the  chips! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Met a buddy here for lunch during the best time of year to enjoy what Ingo's has to offer -- good food on a great patio.    Awesome little lunch spot, also nice for an evening beer / cocktail or two while taking in the scenery.  I truly enjoyed the spacious patio which offered lots of shade and ample people watching, as it sits on the corner of a busy intersection in a trendy area with other restaurants across the streets.    Really good, friendly service, and the veggie black-bean burger was one of the best I've had in recent memory.  Hangry for lunch?  Show up right at 11am weekdays to get a parking spot in the tiny lot and beat the rush!"}
{"text":"...This is my Favorite Place to eat... I go here all the time but today was so good I decided to help about it.... Let me start with the Burger.  Ingos Cheeseburger is somehow the best burger I've ever had every time I have it.  The bun freshly baked in the neighborhood and lightly brushed with mayo, the tomato and the pickles, both thick and juicy, a bed of shredded lettuce for the juicy patty of meat to lay upon while being blanketed by a respectable slice of melting cheddar cheese.  If you have ever seen the episode \"Best Burger in New York\" of \"How I Met Your Mother\" Please refer to Marshals Monologue and then go eat Ingos Cheeseburger. Thank me later.  Chicken and Waffles are my next favorite dish at Ingos but it is only available for weekend brunch.  The chicken is just so good but add to it the strawberry jam they use with the syrup and waffles mmmm mmmm. I wish it was Saturday Morning right now.  The Chicken Sammy is my next regular at Ingos. It's great for summer or lunch anytime.  You know how they say opposites attract? This Sammy proves it.  It's hot & cold, it's sweet & spicy, it's savory & refreshing. I still recall the first time I tried it. It took me by surprise playing with both my senses and emotions, I was so young.  It was before I even knew about chicken and waffles.  Sometimes when I'm feeling saucy I get the chicken Sammy Paris style, or the Paris burger. Both great options if your feeling the whole bacon & BBQ sauce thing.  The chips! Gotta try the chips! The latki (sp?) white creamy sauce on top is amazing but make sure to get some of the green jalapeño sauce to dip it in also the bbq sauce! And sometimes even the spicy sauce they use on the chicken Sammy is good with the chips.  Mix the bbq, jalapeño and latki if your really feeling saucy.   Today I even tried the little salad. I'm not much of a salad guy so it took me off guard when I saw goat cheese and sunflower seeds but I trusted in Ingos and my great server Dama (sp?) and it was delicious! (Shout out to Dama hooking it up with the suggestions, sauces, and being on top of our drinks! ) Again the salad, very refreshing, when you get a good bite the mix of ingredients really compliment each other from start to finish!  I will definitely be having that again  Can't forget about the complimentary mini sea salted chocolate chip cookies they give for takeout orders!  These are addictive so be careful, you can buy the giant versions of them across the street at LGO.    My one complaint goes to the lack of Gelato Sandwiches. In the beginning there were these little round bites of heaven. I still remember the salted caramel melting in my mouth.  Makes me sad. I know the gelato is right next door at LGO but it's all about the cookie dough like super soft cookies used to hold in the freshly made gelato. WHY? WHY DID THEY STOP?!?! Can't LGO at least make them? I'm sorry to raise my voice but c'mon, it was the final piece to this puzzle I call lunch.    Anyways the service is always great, quick and helpful. You can tell the chefs take pride in what they make and present to you, which makes it all the better. Thanks Ingos!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and was great. It is a bit small but the food is awesome! Cool interior and exterior building. I got the chicken sandwich and it was amazing. Think of Chick-Fil-A but times 10. It was temperature hot (I love my food hot) right off the grill and had fresh pickles,great bread and spicy sauce. I also got the chopped kale salad and that was awesome too. The beer they had I think it was North coast was really good summer beer. The prices are very reasonable too. The server was great and manager was very nice. I will definitely go there again soon!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant patio dining. Fresh food, gress-fed, grass-finished beef burger and the chicken sammy was perfect. Who k we green apples and pickles would go together on a chicken sandwich?"}
{"text":"My friend and I shared Igno's Cheeseburger and the Paris, Texas Burger as well as a side of Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. We made sure we ate the cheeseburger first and then the Texan second since we knew that the latter would be flavorful. Good thing! The Texan is flavorful but I don't think I could eat a whole one. Good experience, good food."}
{"text":"We are new to Phoenix and saw this place as we drove by and thought it looked super cute. We looked it up and say good reviews so went for an early Sunday dinner.  We saw inside was only counter seating, so although it was still pretty hot, we sat outside. We ordered iced teas which were tasty.  (I would have had more if I knew there were free refills!)  We ordered Shattered Potato Chips, a cheeseburger and Troubadour Egg Sandwich.   The potato chips came out first. They are potatoes sliced into circles and fried incredibly crisp. We just made big eyes at each other after the first bite. The sauces were good, buy I preferred them just as they were. The egg sandwich and the burger were both solid. No big eyes but very good and fresh tasting.  We asked for dessert and were told they only had complimentary cookies. OK! These were super tasty too and a nice touch.  We were discussing our experience while waiting for the check, saying we really liked the vibe and the food was good while being very reasonably priced. Just then the waitress came over and said the manager was comping our meal because it took longer than they like for it to come out. What? We did not think it took an unusually long time and we did not complain. We argued, but they would not have it. It's nice to see a business holding itself to superior standards even if customers are used to service that may not be the best. We left a nice tip and promised to come back soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great meetup group choice. I ordered the small cheeseburger. The ambiance is great."}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare which made me give this a 4 star versus a 5 star. Food is great = 5 Stars. Service was awesome = 5 stars. Love the touch of the server using ipads and checking you out right there at the table.  My 3 year old spilled her lemonade and they brought napkins immediately and a new lemonade right away. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food: Solid. Any place that cooks a burger medium rare without me having to request it automatically gets bonus points. I got the Paris, Texas Burger. The beef was tender and well seasoned, the produce was fresh, the pancetta on it was crispy and delicious, the bun was decent appeared to be made in house. The Shattered Potato Chips were great. They came with lebni on the side which, isn't my cup of tea, but if you dig lebni I'm sure you will love it. The beer was fresh (very important for an IPA). The section left something to be desired, only 3 on tap and no bottles.  Atmosphere: Decent. Lots of outdoor seating. The building is interesting to look at. They have heaters for the chilly evenings, I have no idea what it will be like in the summer. I think the theme is kind of \"convenience stand\" and so all food and drink comes in/on disposable dishes/cups. Definitely interesting, but I definitely prefer my beer out of a glass.   Service: Excellent. Everyone was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. The one downside to this all is that you tip up front when you order your food before you sit down. I'd probably prefer the ability to tip afterwards."}
{"text":"This is right by my work and I've become a regual. I need to bring it to a 5 star being I had it 4 stars for service being a little off. But the last 4 times I've come there has been amazing service and same people still here. I just love this for lunch bite and a glass of wine to close out the day or for dinner with my man. Come here asap and give this place a try. Your review will be a 5!"}
{"text":"Ingos was suggested to me after my love for LGO was voiced! I did not even notice it was next door because it's this tiny little place, but it is amazing! We ordered the fries, and as a foodie who doesn't actually care for French fries OMG I did not want to share my order with my boyfriend! I ordered the Paris burger (awesome that they let you do lettuce wrapped) and added an egg (extra awesome because it's my favorite topping on a burger)! The beef melted in my mouth, the BBQ sauce was the best I've ever had, and the bacon was crispy. It was an amazing experience will delicious food!"}
{"text":"Go-to spot for lunch or happy hour. Absolutely the best Greyhound cocktail I've ever had. The mini burger sliders and kale salad are delicious and you can't go wrong with the homemade thick-cut potato chips."}
{"text":"An original location with creative flair. Ingo's offers the best of a burger joint with an uptown feel and creative cuisine. I am a sucker for establishments who show some focus on farm to table, but Ingo's not only supports this cause but provides fine fare as well.  I had a great burger, grass fed, a delectable bun with a BBQ sauce and pickle dressing. Ingo's take on deviled eggs, made with goat cheese and topped with pickled beets. Shattered potatoes, with a Mediterranean dipping sauce, and lastly some delectable cookies to wrap the meal.   Not only the food, but the service too was outstanding. This one makes a short list of recommended spots in Scottsdale AZ. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went back tonight, loved the Chicken Sammie and helped my wife finish her amazing fish sandwich!!  Much improved!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting little upscale Arcadia joint. Dog friendly patio a plus of course. Beer also a plus. The burger was delicious, no complaints at the table and just nice chill vibe. Great place for a date or to sit with friends."}
{"text":"There's a few things on the menu (burger, chicken sandwich, fish sandwich, salads) and they do them very well.  The chips are a great side or app to share and the fish and chicken were very good.  I don't know which I'd go with next time but I'd definitely reorder.  If it's a nice day there's more outdoor seating than indoor.  This is the type of place that makes the area great.  You could rotate between here and the spots across the street and never get bored of it."}
{"text":"When my husband and I first started going here three years ago they had the best cheeseburger and steak salad around. They've since changed the menu up and no longer have the salad. The avocado toast has gone through some changes as well but is still quite tasty. I also recommended the chocolate chip cookies inside. Great atmosphere on a nice day but we hope they stop changing the menu and bring back the classics that first started us going."}
{"text":"Ingo's is a hip little patio restaurant that, like Chelsea's Kitchen, falls under the La Grande Orange umbrella. It offers a pretty straight-forward menu that isn't overly complicated. Bar seating inside and patio dining on the outside.   We've been here multiple times and always get the shattered potato chips as a starter. Although, as most reviewers will point out, they're not really chips, but slices of a potato. The lebni addition is a nice touch, although if there is sea salt incorporated, I certainly couldn't taste it. I feel they would have benefited from a little sprinkle of salt and ketchup on the side, which I'm pretty sure Ingo's sees as the equivalent of poison based on its limited availability. I will have my girlfriend smuggle some in her purse on her next visit and hope that we won't be banned for doing so.  The burgers here are on par with what you'd get at most of the gourmet burger places in Phoenix. We've ordered both the Ingo Cheeseburger and Paris, Texas Burger. I recommend opting for the LGO English Muffin instead of the traditional bun, which is what currently sets them apart (at least until Diablo Burger opens up). Any Ingo Cheeseburger can be further enhanced with the addition of a fried egg. They're good, but not quite in the same league as the LGO Burger served next door, which is a whole other experience.  They used to offer ice cream sandwiches for dessert here when they first opened. Those have since been eliminated. You can still get miniature versions of their sea salt cookie. Sometimes the server will give you one or sometimes you just have to go inside and take one. Being a true heel, I took two for myself. Just don't tell anyone.  Overall, I like Ingo's for a quick dinner. I feel it's worth the occasional visit, but it's kind of hard to choose eating here when it's placed right next to its superior big brother in LGO."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix, this has been a go to place for me and my family. I highly recommend the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips - crispy - with the lebni and Ingo's hot sauces. Those two sauces really compliment each other - lebni helps tone down the spice without taking away the flavor. The Kale and Quinoa Salad - add chicken! - is so fresh and delicious! The Troubadour Egg Sandwich is spicy but so gosh darn delicious!! Add those two sauces for a great punch of flavor! The Paris Texas Burger is my absolute favorite. The apple barbecue sauce really adds great dimension to the burger. Finish with the soft serve gelato - the vanilla and pistachio swirl is yum!"}
{"text":"Adding this restaurant to our regular places! Such a cute little place with a lot of unique personality. Not much seating inside so this wouldn't be my place of choice if it was too hot out.  My husband and I got burgers - I got their regular small burger and he got a larger bacon burger. Burgers were so moist and delicious, you can tell it's grass-fed beef. I really wished I could have done regular ole ketchup and mustard on my burger because I'm old fashioned, but I don't think they even supply ketchup and mustard here. The shattered fries were awesome, so fresh, you can tell and see that they make everything from scratch. Service was so fast! Got our food in less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"We've come here twice now. Amazing service all around and great food. The avocado toast is delicious and so are the chips! Try the Almdudler too!  Wish I remembered our server's name though...curly hair, gigantic smile!"}
{"text":"food: chicken sammy. i can taste everything but the chicken. the texture is right, the sauce is good, but no chicken flavor. it was just something crispy inbetween buns. ***3/5  service: the server was friendly. i liked the space. feels like a modern diner. lots of windows and lit the place. i liked sitting in front by the kitchen watching the cooks make the food. ***4/5  value: the sandwich is small. not good enough for the price. ***3/5"}
{"text":"I love L.G.O. so this being part of their family of restaurants made me really want to like it.  Unfortunately I was a little disappointed with our first experience.    The decor and ambience was cool and modern.  We sat at the bar which allowed us to see the cooks prepare the food.  My friend and I ordered the shattered chips, Ingo Burger and Paris Texas Burger.    The chips came out right away.  This was fantastic.  I would come back just for this.    My friend and I decided to split the two burgers as they both sounded good.  We pretty much had the same impression of both.  This Ingo burger had too much sauerkraut that pretty much overpowered the flavor making the burger part cold and soggy.  The beef was good but barely noticeable.  The Paris Texas burger was partially better but again had an overpowering sweetness with it's apple bbq sauce.  No complaints on the beef or the quality of the ingredients - just the balance of the flavors were off.  Overall the balance of the burger was no where near what you'd expect from a place like this.  What made it worse was the burgers are extremely small.  I'm not a big guy but after eating the burger and chip I was literally still hungry.  We didn't want to order another mediocre $8.25 burger each so we literally left to go to another restaurant nearby.   I might give Ingo's another chance just for the chips and maybe the 1 hour availability egg salad sandwich.  As expected the service was excellent and the complementary sea salt cookies are a nice touch."}
{"text":"The weather didn't hurt today but lunch was amazing. My wife and I split a pitcher of sangria and we each had a sandwich. I had the regular cheeseburger and she had the fish sandwich. The potato chips are great and don't miss the deviled eggs. Bailey, our dog had a fine time as well."}
{"text":"Chicken Sammy is delicious and other food looked good.  Inside seating is limited, but more outside seating with misters. Great lunch or snack spot."}
{"text":"Burgers tasty but too small for the price.  Please rethink this ..Many other establishments offer more of a product, for a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"So this is a new spot and as such it does have some growing pains.  I really love this area a  great deal and I think this will be a solid addition once they iron out the kinks.  First: parking is a bi*#%.  It's ridiculous. Truly. There are maybe 10 spots. You *can* park down the street behind a dry cleaners in the overflow lot for La Grande Orange.    Ordering:  weird.  Those who wish to sit outside need to go up to the ordering counter and place your order there. Then they seat you.  Okay fine. But come warmer weather and that window is going to be a cluster you know what.    We came for happy hour (they don't have one).  NO HH ?  That needs fixing.  Once you are seated then you can be waited on without having to go to the counter again. HOwever it's another pay as you go situation. Weird.  I will say the food was delicious.  I got the kale/quinoa salad and it was right up there with True Food's kale salad. However, it was more like a side salad portion. I mean, it's not a burger, it is a salad so it's not as filling. I was still hungry when I finished.    Everyone else got burgers and said they were outstanding.    Everything is a la carte, so you have to order a side on your own. My friends got the fried pottatoes and they were delicious.   The menu is quite limited but what we had was delicious, albeit somewhat small portions."}
{"text":"I am in love with Ingo!! Definitely surprised I haven't written a review sooner, I have been here multiple times and have had a stellar experience every time.  The food is delicious, fresh, and generally healthy options. I love the avocado toast (taken off the menu...SAD...but I guess I'm not the only one sad about this because they have it back as a special!), the white fish sandwich, and the stands-above-the-rest must-order crispy chicken Sammy. The burgers rock, shattered potato chips... I could go on and on. AND they have a jar of salted chocolate chip cookies so satisfy your sweet tooth after the meal!  Super cute location, love both the patio and inside bar where you can watch them cook. Service is friendly, especially Britt G. Thank you Ingo! Keep on keepin on!"}
{"text":"Few things. The food was amazing. Atmosphere was very nice as well. The only problem I had was the lady running expo. Which I believe she is a manager. A server came up to ask a question and she  ignored her. The server walked away and she rolled her eyes. So, I know she heard her saying her name. She would yell for runners in a rude way! The servers still had a great attitude! Kudos to them. To sit at the bar and observe this was disturbing. I have been a restaurant manager for several years. She for sure needs to read the book One minute manager by Ken Davenport! Would help her a lot. Other then observing a manager being rude to the staff. Everything was great!   \"People who feel good about themselves, produce good results.\""}
{"text":"Complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies!!!!!  OMG!!!!  Tuna sandwich, kale salad, Mother Earth on toast and the shattered potatoes with lebni are mouthwatering awesome!  I have yet to try their egg salad...it is always sold out when I get there!!!!  Anyway, great food, friendly staff and great atmosphere!  Will go back over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at Ingo's and I love this place! Great for take out or eating out on the patio! Our server Courtney was very nice.  She offered many great suggestions and I chose to try the Paris Texas Burger with the grass fed beef and the Shattered Potato Chips. I loved both! My daughter had the Vegetarian Black Bean Burger which was also very good.  Next I plan to try Toni's Deviled Eggs and the Crispy Chicken Sammy.  See you soon Ingo's"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. We ordered quite a few things to share amongst ourselves and everything was delicious! Service was quick and friendly and our server had great recommendations. They no longer have kambucha which was disappointing because they're praying monk drink was fantastic but the sangria was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I base all of my reviews on service and this place doesn't disappoint. The service is very attentive, extremely friendly and fast.   Loved the Farmers Daughter burger. I can see how it won the best of Phoenix.   My only regret is it took me so long to try Ingo!"}
{"text":"Great little quaint restaurant!!! And there is parking!!!  Additional lot around the corner. Super healthy and very friendly staff!! I will recommend this little round local burger shop to all my friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this neighborhood gem - I do not normally eat burgers but the burgers here are amazing and don't have that \"funny\"ground beef taste. The  only reason why I don't give ''tis place 5stars is the beer selection .  The Stone polder has too much bite,  you need something more drinkable and light.  Scottsdale Blond, or Orange Papago."}
{"text":"Some of the best customer service I've had at a restaurant! The girls working here were so sweet and very helpful describing the menu and suggested drinks for certain foods. Oh and the food is crazy good - order their homemade potato chips as an appetizer! I love that the entrees here are all fresh and healthy and actually reasonably priced. The parking situation is kind of crappy - there's about five total spots in their little lot but you can always park across the street and walk!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had as a person eating with food allergies. At the beginning of the meal, I informed the waitress that I had Celiacs Disease, and asked if the items I selected were gluten free. She assured me thy were fine.   They brought out the chips, which I began eating. About 5 minutes after bringing out the chips, the waitress comes by and says, \"You didn't eat any of those yet, did you? They're not gluten free.\"   The meal made me horribly ill, the manager never came by to apologize, and the waitress provided a very halfhearted, \"Oh, sorry. You didn't eat a lot of them, though, right?\" The lack of awareness of food allergies, I believe, makes this an unsafe place for people suffering from said allergies to eat."}
{"text":"CUTE, TINY SPOT in the Arcadia area. I had the black bean burger and potato chips with salsa. The burger was very good, kind of your usual vegetarian option. The potato chips were EXCELLENT and the salsa was super good. Happy hour drinks were also very good and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always good, the drinks better and the service top notch."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place at the moment. Shattered potatoes, egg salad, hot sauce, burgers, drinks, AND the pride.  All the ingredients are so well thought out.   They say the place is named after the owners first music teacher.  I have to wonder if the instrument of choice was a drum considering the building looks like a drum. Ingo's is non GMO and local.  From the homemade almond mylk to grass feed beef, I am gaga for Ingo's. Eat local, support local, and this is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is my favorite place to eat right now. Everything I have ordered is absolute perfection. My current favorites are the Farmer's Daughter burger --topped with homemade sauerkraut -- yum. I also love the kale salad, one of the best in the city. They have the best cocktail too-The Greyhound, made with a french grapefruit liqueur. It's casual, friendly and you can almost always get a table immediately. The people at LGO Hospitality know how to create a great restauramt."}
{"text":"May 23, 2018  Tasty food indeed!  Great service, too!  (Ask for Martin!)  I definitely am returning to try other tasty-sounding items on the menu.  Ordered half-portions of two appetizers and the \"seasonal 'rita\" since I had a YEE (Yelp elite event) to attend after the meal.  Strange that I was charged full-priced for the drink after I was told that the cocktails were $2 off during HH...  Oh, well.    I like that I was able to order half-orders on almost everything on the menu, except the Crispy chicken sandwich.  And to be able to change my mind and do full orders mid-meal is even better!  I tried the special salad of the day, which was the Orange-Fennel salad, minus the orange (allergy), and the Shattered Chips-- deep-fried slices of potato chips dusted with cracked salt and garnished with lebni and homemade jalapeno sauce.  Both were fabulous!  The salad came with goat cheese and almonds.  I was not aware that it also came with avocado (allergy), so I had to fish the pieces out.    No dessert, as Ingo's Tasty Food is part of the LGO restaurant concept, and the idea is to have people experience deconstructed dining by eating food here and then crossing the street to have dessert at LGO.  There was a footed stand of complimentary salted chocolate chips, which I was told I could help myself to, which I did, but the cookies were too salty and too hard/dry.  I'd suggest to pass on these, unless you like over-salted and rock-hard cookies...  Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Fun vibe! Loved the spuds, fish sandwich was above expectations.  Really cool plastic cups (if plastic can ever be cool).  The employees were all having a great time which truly makes for a better experience, while you apparently love your job, we loved our dining experience. Oh the free cookies were a nice ending touch which led us to cross the street for more sweet treats.  Nice Job overall, will come back for another casual date night with the spousal unit."}
{"text":"Ingo's is doing great again. We went a couple weeks back and had the chicken sandwich and it was completely different and not very good in our minds, but we love this place so wanted to give it another try...who knows, it could have just been the night we went. The dips we had on the bad night were not great and we did not get them again for that fear, but agreed the next time we go, we will give them a try.  So we had the chicken sandwich again and it was up to par and delicious. We had the chips and they gave us this awesome Jalapeno dip which was delish (and they shared how they make it which made us happy!).  We also tried out their new cocktails which were awesome (try the greyhound!).  We cant wait to go again and try some of the newer items and retry some that we didn't have a great time with before. Every time we go back, they just get better!"}
{"text":"Hello? Healthy! I had lunch here with my friend Jeran after doing our morning hike, and rejuvenating mani/pedi treatment. I love the  outside seating and a fresh veggie appetizer. I am so coming back here for sure! The only issue I have is the lack of parking. Best time to come here is before the lunch and dinner rush."}
{"text":"I honestly think they have the best burgers in town.  Even better than their burgers though,  are the shattered chips with the white dip/sauce they are served with.  The potatoes are fried to crispy perfection.  The sauce is Greek yogurt with lemon zest.  Totally unexpected but amazingly delicious.  Don't leave without a sea salt chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Gourmet concession stand.   We were excited to try this new LGO concept and both felt meh about it. I had the beet and lentil salad and my bf had the tuna burger. Both had really good flavor but the salad was very small; best as a side dish. The potato chips looked awesome but we didn't order them; after reading other reviews it seems we should have. The menu is limited and aside from burgers doesn't have a lot of interesting options. Bathrooms are gas station style- accessed from the outside and in order to use them you have to wait in line to get a key from the ordering window. I was also bummed that my diet coke came in a (not as cold as I would hope) can served with a flimsy plastic cup sans ice. We love LGO 's other restaurants and were hoping for more from this new spot."}
{"text":"Well, I liked the food here so much last Monday that I had to come back yesterday for some more! On my first visit I had fallen in love with the Kale salad and I just can't get enough of that. It's not quite enough to satisfy me as a meal, however, so both visits I got a sandwich too. First time I ordered the Paris, TX burger and it was fabulous; I would eat this every day of the week. BBQ bacon cheesburgers are my guilty pleasure but a lot of times they can get way too greasy and soggy. Ingo's version uses pancetta and grass fed beef which cuts down on the fat but amps up the flavor. This is probably one of the better burgers I have eaten but in the interest of trying new things yesterday I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. I thought they were being fancy by calling it chicken schnitzel rather than fried chicken but it made sense after I received it because it was a nice thin, skinless breast piece of chicken coated with a crispy breading. I think they probably do deep fry it because I don't know how else you could get the crust so nice and crispy but the meat inside was still very moist. Again it was not too greasy at all. I don't like aioli so she brought me some of their Dijon mustard and I thought it went perfectly.  I know I will keep coming back just because the food is so delicious but I also love the fact that they use organic and humanely raised meat products. Their prices are reasonable for the level of quality of the ingredients. Those two items (salad and sandwich) made a pretty filling meal for only $14. Service was great and even though the place is very small it wasn't too loud or cramped feeling. Really the only thing keeping them from 5 stars is the lack of parking. I can see that is going to be a big problem as they get more popular."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine here again. As per the manager's recommendation, we ordered:  1) Hummus & Pumpkin Seed dip (which was the best hummus I've had in AZ!): the veggies were fresh and I loved the selection of veggies they provided 2) Kokuho rose brown rice bowl (rice, feta, pistachio, shiitake, egg, and herbs): at first, it seemed just okay. Then we remembered our server had given us a jalapeno sauce to go with it. It was the key ingredient! It really brought all the flavors together. 3) Shredded kale and quinoa salad (sunflower seeds, grapes, preserved lemon, red peppers, parmesan, manchego): there was a little too much dressing, but it was a good salad overall  The service was fantastic. Everyone was friendly and I liked how they all helped each other. It was lovely to be able to dine outside on the dog friendly patio! By the way - the servers were attentive to the four-legged patrons as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.   It's a cute little place that has no more than 24 seats on the inside but with a nice sized patio. You walk in and you are immediately hit with a wave of scent from the grill, which is surrounded by the seats in a u formation.   The menu is simple. Booze and good food. We ordered the chips which came with an overwhelming number of chips with a delicious house sauce for dipping.   I highly suggest ordering some burgers. They give you the option of getting a slider or full size (awesome!!!!) of any of their burgers. First time here? Definitely get some sliders. It doesn't come with side, but it does come with a carrot (What's up doc?).   As I mentioned, it is SMALL.  Be prepared to wait or possibly break into smaller groups if you're with a larger party.    Ok, now for the best part. FREE COOKIES. Yes, you read that correctly ladies and gentlemen. FREE COOKIES FOR EVERYONE. When I went, there was a plate of cookies to take as you left. Others who were there mentioned they used to get cookies on their plate. I don't know how you'll get your cookies, but you are going to love these cookies.    Did I mention free cookies?"}
{"text":"Ingo's lived up to the hype. The chicken sammy is that good. Really! But how about the veggies and hummus? They were so good, with free refills on veggies (yea, mom, I like my veggies now). As you would expect from the ownership, the service is superb, too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is average. I felt the three stars is fitting because nothing will blow you away about the place. You'll sit outside and feel trendy while you eat an average burger (with no fries), drinking a beer (from a selection of 2), while you stare out at the beautiful view of 40th street. Wasn't terrible, but for what it is (burgers / bar food and drinks) I just think that there are better places to go. But I won't name any names, I'm not that savage."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place was anything special. I think they think they are too cool for school- but I was left wanting more and felt very unsatisfied with my food. It's really unfortunate because they are in such prime location.   Skip them and go to LGO or Postinos instead."}
{"text":"Daaiim is awesome! Great service! Ask for daaiim. His name is pronounced DAH-eeem! Foods awesome and I love it here."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh boi, they did it again! What a cute place. Small wrap around bar and awesome quite dog friendly outside.  Killer burgers and mostly the chips. Pretty good . I has the tuna and pretty good , also tried the burger! Stop by"}
{"text":"Just tried this place and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved our experience here! The atmosphere is great. It's a small place, but super cute. Our server was lovely and provided friendly service. We both got the black bean burger and shared the house made potato chips. The chips were delicious with amazing dipping sauces. The black bean burger was the best I've ever had! Yes, it does fall apart quite a bit so be warned, but that really didn't bother us. Most bean burgers I have tried are very very dry and bland, but theirs was very flavorful and not dry at all. It left us both feeling full and satisfied. I love that they have options for both meat eaters and vegans. Usually places that offer vegan meals leave something to be desired, but they really nailed it with their burger.  Their fresh squeezed lemonade was delicious as well and tasted so fresh. Not too sweet. Just perfect.  Overall we left very satisfied! I love locally owned businesses and I'm happy to have discovered this restaurant."}
{"text":"Extremely limited menu. Server was very nice.  Came here with my in-laws and my 10m old baby. The deviled eggs are a little too heavy in the mustard department. The deviled eggs at Garage are infinitely better.  The potato chips were good. Burger is fair at best-- meat wasn't bad but the bun leaves a lot to be desired. I much prefer the burgers across the street at LGO, at the Attic or at Chicago burger company.   With so many other great options in the area- Ingos just fell ridiculously short. You couldn't pay me to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had the shattered chips, hummus board and cheeseburger--all deeeelish!! Great service and reasonable prices and it was a perfect night to sit on the patio.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried Ingo's the first time. Positive:  The burger was excellent, almost as good as a Fergburger in Queenstown New Zealand.  Very flavorful!  5 stars. Negative:  Service was very very bad.  We sat inside at the bar.  Almost all servers seemed bothered.  Zero eye contact.  No smiles.  After burgers were delivered, no one ever checked in on us.  We needed another napkin and couldn't get anyone's attention, so we got up and stole one from the cookie stand!  1 star."}
{"text":"Vegan Dalai Llama burrito is a WIN! Also a huge plus that the patio is pup friendly:)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a really good burger! Awesome building with some really cool atmosphere! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"The food is super great and the staff is very helpful. It's just very expensive and when you order and burger is doesn't come with any sides but is still very expensive. Would definitely recommend going!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great burger experience this past Sunday.  Toasted bun, just enough BBQ sauce to make it interesting and the burger was cooked perfectly.  Fries are more like chips, but are awesome.  The finishing touch was the homemade next-level jalapeño sauce."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and cool place. The chicken sandwich was delicious. This is an excellent neighborhood restaurant for simple and inexpensive meals. Their menu is small, but powerful."}
{"text":"Burger perfection. Slightly smaller portions but the ingredients and preparation are so perfect I got to go with five stars. Wait staff are friendly, attentive, and unpretentious. Be prepared for a mild inconvenience of difficult parking."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick lunch, totally impressed! The menu is small BUT covers all the Foodie bases. I had the Kale Salad and will crave it from now on. Service was fabulous and we sat outdoors in September...oh yeah! Great spot, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Just sat down at ingo's.   5 stars based on Chloe our waitress. Haven't tried the food yet.   Kidding.  Handcut chips definitely stand out from your standard side-- picture the first chef who tried dicing up a potato and fried it. You haven't tried it before and you'll like it. Texture was a 10, flavor lacked a bit for my taste (in all fairness I'm more of ranch and chipotle aioli on everything guy; their sauce is a more subtle sour cream flavor).   All three of us got the Paris burger-- picture a single from in-n-out for size, even your smallest of girlfriends will finish it. Don't get me wrong, appreciated flavor versus size.  I definitely advise getting the chips (and Stone IPA) to fill up.  On to alch. Although the simple menu is hip, I prefer a little more depth for the craft beer lineup.    Overall you'll enjoy their twist on a burger/diner joint. The 20 minute turnaround makes it a great call after work.   If I can't post my picture you'll have to take my word for it-- you're indulging in my first yelp contribution. Still a huge fan of Chloe."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat at LGOs new place. It was not disappointing !!! I had the Paris Texas burger-meat was perfectly cooked and juicy, flavors were great!   Me friend had the brown rice bowl with poached egg, pistachios and other delicious things!! Really yummy!   We also both enjoyed the wine spritzer drink! It was delicious and light! Not too sweet, just right.   I will be returning soon :)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place with a very different design concept. Walk up window for beer ordering? Yes please! Lots of helpful staff members. Have not tried the food yet but I'm sure it's great.  The parking looks a little cramped but I didn't have any issues. You all should try it!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place since we consider ourselves burger experts. Unfortunately we did not think it was worth all the hype.   Pros: -super easy curbside pickup -very friendly staff -great looking menu  Cons: -Burgers lacked flavor -pricey  -potatoes were soggy and couldn't decide if they were chips or scalloped"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to say anything, but after another person mentioned it, thought I would just throw it out there.  I'm sure many people received the same email inviting you to attend the opening this past Sunday.  Based on the email, we were expecting to be \"treated\" to their food.  Upon arrival, we found out it was a paying event.  I think this was a ploy by the owners to \"bait and switch\" loyal LGO customers.  After looking at the limited menu, we decided to go elsewhere.  I was fairly disappointed at the antics used to lure customers to their opening."}
{"text":"Yes, Ingo's is tasty.  Ingo's is also pricey.  Portions are small and beer is expensive - an eight ounce glass of Sculpin IPA will set you back $7.  I had the chicken sandwich \"Adam and Eve\" style, which is sans bread.  The sandwich was tasty but small.  Had chips on the side, - they do a great job with the chips.  Service was lackluster, and here is what kills a star for me.  They use the mobile devices to run your card right at the table, then the tip amounts are automatically calculated, so you cannot decide what amount to give apart from their pre-set tip amounts.  Doing this while the server is standing over you is uncomfortable - especially when the service was as bad as it was.  Despite that Ingo's is a short walk from home, I think I'll pass in the future."}
{"text":"Yes, very tasty food.  I have had salads and a burger from here and I'm quite impressed with the quality.  If you're looking for a nice, filling chicken Caesar, Ingo's will certainly deliver.  As for burgers, they make a fancier, buttered bun type of one, although it's not a terribly large plate of food.  Prices are on the higher side of moderate.  If you're in the neighborhood, this is a great \"meet me here after work\" kind of place."}
{"text":"I came here on the last day of my trip to Phx and was pleasntly suprised! Its such a quaint little place. I had the Paris/Texas burger and it was wonderful. It melted in your mouth with the freshly baked bun. I love how they show where they get all their ingredients locally on their menu. Service was fast and the waitresses engage you in conversation and dont act like youre some shmuck and ignore you. Wish they had a larger beer selection and that my Stone IPA was served in a glass pint instead of a plastic wine glass type of cup. I understand they are going for a \"no dishes\" theme but hate drinking good beer out of a plastic. Drank enough natty light and keystone out lf red cups in college and get flashbacks. Anyways, nice place and they have a pick up window too if you dont want to sit you can take your \"craft burger\" home! We also got a free salted carmel cookie on the way out the door! Place was a little gem. Check it out if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Still really good food but atrocious service tonight.  The waitress was certainly more interested in talking with her coworkers about how much another server made in tips than in waiting on the customers.  Another coworker ended up refilling our drinks after they had been dry for over 5 minutes and delivering our food."}
{"text":"Things have been back on point for a bit of time now. Good size breast, very juicy , and a light flaky breading !  We stop in several time a month as well as order curbside."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a place that is hip and fun and great burgers and chips you need to go. Everything is fresh made to order."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Phoenix, for real. It's not only non-gmo and grass-fed beef and all the other humane and healthy food sources (which is what prompted me to go here) but it's super tasty. Sauces are on point. Place is bangin and staff is sweet. Lovin it Yall."}
{"text":"I want the Paris, Texas burger every day for the rest of my life! I've still only had it once! Bring that puppy up to ck at the airport! I'll sell it like crazy!"}
{"text":"Typically, I am wary of establishments that put the words: best, tasty or even yummy in their name. However, Ingo you are quite the exception!  Having breakfast at their sister store, La Grande Orange, across the street before it was an absolute must to visit Ingo's if you love their food. Instead of fresh juice, pizzas and crepes Ingo's provides grass-fed beef burgers, healthy apps and a good variety of wine and beer (some coming from CA) to cause some CA nostalgia.  Since I was dining with my roommate we decided to sit out on the patio and to share a meal with a couple of items so we could see what Ingo had to offer. We decided to start with the Hummus and Pumpkin Seed Guacamole served with crudites as our appetizer, the Paris, Texas burger to share and to drink the Black Market Hefeweizen and the Lyric By Etude Pinot Noir.  Hummus and Pumpkin Seed Guac- pretty large portion app for two people to share, good creamy hummus, with slight heat, thick consistency, the Pumpkin Seed Guac was not my fave, but it was all a personal preference. Comes with cauliflower, cucumbers, carrots, celery and golden beets.  Paris, Texas Burger- Really good burger, cooked well, juicy, love how the sharp cheddar cheese came through, crispy bacon, slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce and the pickles were awesome! They crisp the interior of the buns giving a good texturally crunch contrasting the soft, airiness of the outer bun.  Black Market Hefeweizen- Fruity, light, refreshing. I could drink this all night. Lyric By Etude Pinot Noir- Apparently acidic, tangy, berry flavor, spicy and tannic.  Great service through out the night, lovely atmosphere inside and out and awesome food! Definitely will be back to try their other burgers, the rest of the drink list and hell, I just realized they carry dessert here. Hold that last thought, I'm on my way back already!"}
{"text":"Not understanding the hype here. Simplistic menu with not many options. My group ordered a variety and no one was impressed by the burgers. The chips were also just fried potato circles but many of my order were undercooked. The side sauce that comes with the chips is good though. The lemonade was the best thing anyone tried there, nice and sour and not packed with sugar. Even with that, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with my Hubby,  Baby sis, and my dog! Great outdoor patio area with string lights and laid back ambiance. We ordered the fries, Apple chicken burger, and the Ingos Cheeseburger and everything was absolutely tasty and delicious! To end the night we got the gelato sandwich and it was the perfect end to a great dinner! Our server was great and the GM introduced herself at the end to see how our meal was which was very nice. Overall a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite burger in the valley... hands down. However, lunch service is hit and miss. Seems like a lot of staff turnover from my experience, which is the only reason I'm not rating this 5 stars. Other than that, the apps and drinks, in addition to the burgers are amazing!"}
{"text":"UPDATED: The manager/owner reached out to me in regards to making my dining experience better and I happily accepted the challenge of trying this place again. We finally got around to coming back and we're super pleased with the service... great friendly staff (once again) and super helpful on explaining the menu. We ordered the chips again... jeez! This recipe is amazing!! The sauces to dip in are equally as amazing. I then got the cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the Paris burger with egg. He was super excited about his. Mine was a simple cheeseburger (just how I like it) but very comparable to other burgers. I'll be back for a drink and the chips!! Thanks again for the management team, owner, and staff! Great customer service.   OLD REVIEW: Okay, I wanted to be a huge fan of this place... it's walking distance from my work and house, it uses grass fed beef, and I LOVE locally owned restaurants. We ordered the devil eggs, chips, Paris burger, and chicken sandwich. Devil eggs were great, got us on a good start. Chips were the best part of the meal! Amazing! I didn't try the burger but I heard it was \"good\". The chicken sandwich had no flavor and was lathered in grease... the apple was a nice touch but it needed more flavor to the sandwich to make it better."}
{"text":"Tasty in the name is accurate.  Tasty food.  Burger is juicy and cooked perfectly with excellent toppings.  Their homemade pickles are spot on.  Shattered fries are tasty - but the green dipping sauce is out of this world.  Other visits have had their crispy chicken sammy which is great.  Going to try the fish sandwich next.  Took leftovers home - would have loved if they would have offered some of the sauces to go since those were emptied before the fries...pricey for the sizes but tasty."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a lover of Le Grande Orange and this concept restaurant for LGO meets, no exceeds, the exceptional food quality I've come to expect from LGO. INGO may be small on size but don't let that fool you. Their food has BIG flavors! So I started with the shattered potato chips. Crispy, crunchy, and served with a lemony tazaki like dip (whatever it was- it's super tasty!) no need for ketchup for these chips! Then to the grassfed beef burgers. When they say cooked and served with pink - that isn't a lie. BUT they are so juicy and delicious. I has the Paris TX burger- a delicious blend of BBQ sauce, pancetta, aged cheddar, and pickles. Ok, so I am usually not a fan of pickles on my burger... But these aren't your usual salty, vinegary, overly dill pickles. They make them fresh and they are the perfect blend of dill and sweetness with the crunch of a fresh cucumber and they compliment the burger amazingly. Overall 5 star food for a 3 star price!  Now I put the food first because let's be honest - that's why you review a restaurant!  But the atmosphere is worth mentioning. Indoor and outdoor seating with an open kitchen and bistro lights. Driven by on a Saturday and it seems like a great hangout. If you arent in the mood for an amazing LGO pizza but rather a juicy burger - cross the street and enjoy INGO!!!!"}
{"text":"what a cool, unique little spot.  Small patio and diner with distinctive casual yet hip European feel.  Great daily happy hour (11-7), and a small but tasty menu. We tried the deviled eggs, which were delicious (but not sure why you only get 1.5 not 2 full halves), and the Farmer's daughter burger.  Great that you can get it lo carb on lettuce as well.  chips are great and a big portion as well. A definite if you're in the 40th/Campbell neighborhood."}
{"text":"Did lunch here with the pooch. Nice patio. Plenty of shade. Water bowl for your dog, too.  Burgers were very juicy and tasty. Happy hour drinks made going with a soft drink/ice tea not worth it. $3 beer/wine vs $2.75 for ice tea.  They'll do a $4 ala cart burger patty for your dog, too. That was a huge hit and gave me the chance to just taste the meat. It was very good.  Would go here again."}
{"text":"Ingo is my favorite hang out for a drink and a light meal. The patio is divine in all kinds of weather. I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Get the shattered potato chips to start. Bummed they took the Mr Midnight salad off the menu."}
{"text":"Holy schnitzel... Farmers burger, chicken schnitzel, shattered chips... All perfectly cooked.  Burger medium rare and chicken was tender and juicy.   Prices are high but the ingredients are QUALITY.  The only downside was the tiny glass of tea at $2.75 with no refills.  Excellent service too.  Happy hour from 11-7pm $4 beer and $4 red/white wine (house selection).  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, Ingos. The place has such a cool atmosphere - has a nice neighborhood hangout feel.   The place is perfect for grabbing a bite after a workout or hike up Camelback. Yet, it's also good for a casual night out with your friends. Love the versatility of the place."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches... Great service... Vegetarian options are bomb! Kids love it. Shattered potatoes are where it's at..get that fermented jalapeño salsa!! Love this place..lovely patio...good music...one of my new favorite places....so far they are doing a great job. Just a few dishes I would improve but just about everything is enjoyable. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here tonight.  The service was by far the best service I have ever received at any restaurant.  We had three different people come up to us as well as one of the cooks as well as what seemed to be the manager of the restaurant.  It was outstanding and the servers were all very nice.    However, I have to give a fair review and say the food was subpar.  I had a cheeseburger and my girlfriend had the tuna burger.  She loved hers, but I thought mine was overly greasy and it fell apart as I ate it.  Not one of the better cheeseburgers I have had.  We also got the potato chips which were good and my girlfriend loved the sauce that came with it.    I have to say I probably won't be coming back here due to the low quality of the food, but the service is exceptional and location is great as well."}
{"text":"Tasty may be an understatement. It was awesome. Had the tuna burger Adam & Eve style. Silly good. Service was fast and friendly, a smile and a thank you. Devil really is in the details. Speaking of which, the tuna was flavorful along with a half avocado and sauce (aioli?) was perfect accompaniment. The only thing I would ask for is the lettuce to be replaced with Romain or butter lettuce, but that's just my wish list. I cannot believe I passed by w/o stopping for so long. They make dieting and losing weight easy with dishes like that!"}
{"text":"I frequent La Grande a ton and saw this place being built over the last 15 years. Hahahaha, sure as hell seemed like 15 years. I was shocked that it was a restaurant going in this tiny little round building. I finally tried it a week an half ago and I couldn't have been more rewarded for my wait. I keep having to update my fav burgers in Phoenix and I have to say it. Ingos is it!! The Stand and Delux have been knocked down the list.   Backing it up this way -  Bun - Ingo's (Light and perfect size) Meat - Ingo's (Seasoned right, juicy and medium rare) Sauce - Ingo's (Whatever the hell it is it's delicious!) Fries/Potato Chips - Ingo's (These PC are something else. Worth the trip alone) Service - Ingo's (Great personable service. Goes a long, long way)  La Grande Hospitality has done it again. Another great concept restaurant that was thought out, from the space to the menu. There are a lot of conceptual restaurant groups in town and they usually fall short. Good job LGO, when do you open The Luggage Room here?"}
{"text":"If your in the Arcadia area and your looking for a no nonsense burger and beer stop, Ingos Tasty Food will not disappoint!   We started with shattered potatoes chips and a Paris, Texas Burger washed down with a refreshing Almdudler to really round off the salty savory flavors.  This sister restaurant to the LGO (La Grande Orange) market right across the street really lives up to name Tasty!  The chef was close enough to watch them make your meal, and a little Carmel ice cream sandwich made by the gelato place in LGO really made an exceptional conclusion to our new favorite spot!  Greatly looking forward to our next visit, quietest times on Saturday are before 700p if you enjoy a quieter experience    Recommended for quick meals at the bar with friends- 4.9 Stars"}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu is simple but has everything a patio restaurant could need...and the food is amazing!!! The service is great and place is adorable. They really hit it out of the park with this concept."}
{"text":"I'm currently here in a business meeting and the service is phenomenal from our server Jenny and manager Erin. Thank you so much for the great food and wine...but most of all friendly service:)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They have a vegetarian burger, and, it's actually vegan. House made patty w/ house made vegan nut cheese. I absolutely love it. I don't know if the original bun is vegan BUT you can get it \"Adam and Eve\" style, or, if you like the carbs, get it w/ the LGO English Muffin, which is vegan. I have had it both ways and love it both way. The staff reassured me that their veggie bun does not contain egg or dairy and that it truly is 100% vegan, and I have asked on numerous occasions. The seats are quick, the service is easy, and it's a great casual place to grab a good bite for anyone even those w/ dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Incredible early birthday dinner last night with parents and girlfriend. When the weather in Arcadia makes you feel like you're living in Southern CA with that perfect breeze nothing is better. Love the food (always) and the greyhound on tap is delicious !!"}
{"text":"Great fast but fresh food! More of a casual Lunch or early dinner spot as it's rather small inside and has a limited menu. But the limited menu doesn't mean everything isn't great! The fish sandwich is delicious and the potato chips and dip is good too! Get the spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"I see there are already over 100 good reviews but I just have to put in my 2 cents. A friend of mine turned me onto a burger from Ingos the other day, it smelled so good when he got in the car that I just had to take a bite right away. When I opened the container, not only was the burger picture perfect but its made with grass fed beef & the taste was so delicious that I didn't want to put it away & wait until I got home to finish the rest. It was so juicy but not greasy at all. The potatoes that came with it are somewhere between a chip & a French fry, and also super tasty. This is definitely my new favorite burger joint, even though the parking lot is very small & kind of hard to park, its worth it even if I have to park down the street & walk there. I can't wait to try other items off the menu too."}
{"text":"Had the white fish sandwich, grilled not fried, and it was excellent!! My only recommendation is that they should throw in a few potato chips with a sandwich purchase instead of needing to purchase them separately."}
{"text":"My hiking partner strikes again, as during our 2nd descent down Piestewa today, she asked some guys around us for a hamburger restaurant rico.  \"Ingo's\" they shot back!  It's a round, quaint little place, slightly reminiscent of the old Woolworth lunch counter style dining.  If there's a free seat, take it, or stand on top of the printed footsteps located behind each position at the counter  We had a waitress in training, and both she and her trainer were pleasant and charming, full of recommendations and suggestions.  The Paris, Texas burger caught my fancy, and I requested it with the BBQ sauce on the side, topped with a fried egg.  It arrived with a darling heart tipped toothpick which held the condiments in place.  The burger was delicious and juicy, with a light and airy bun, crisp bacon, and this amazing fermented jalapeno sauce.  I actually tossed back a shooter of one.  And the \"potato chips\" were thin cut, french fried potato rings, crispy on the outside, creamy inside.  And when customers were all paid up, they hit the \"cookie jar\" before bouncing, as there were fresh made cookies, free for the taking.  I can imagine this place gets crazy busy, as the food is so good I tried to talk Yuko into splitting another burger with me... its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always prompt service! Great interaction with the staff! They serve quality product with consistency, not to mention the awesome ambiance provided by their unique patio experience! ...also, super stoked they started selling the green jalapeño sauce! Smart move! If you haven't tried it, it's definitely a must!! I'm forever a loyal \"regular\"."}
{"text":"Veggie Black Bean Burger...  SO.FREAKING.GOOD!!!  I recently adopted a vegan diet and was craving a burger, this absolutely hit the spot.  My girlfriends and I ordered delivery (they also had the burger and loved it!) so I can't touch on wait times/service or anything like that, but I can attest to the fact that their food is fantastic! Looking forward to taking my boyfriend for happy hour so we can try the shattered potato chips and sip on some cold draft beer"}
{"text":"AHH-MAZING sandwiches!! Another win for the LGO brand. The crispy chicken Sammy was voted as a top chicken sandwich in AZ...it did not disappoint. The fish sandwich was actually the winner of the day. The tartar sauce was out of this world. Service was great, great patio, and some of the best restaurant music I have had in town! This will defiantly be a go to in the Arcadia area food meca."}
{"text":"Second time here and again I ordered the watermelon salad and wasn't disappointed. Tried a burger for the first time and enjoyed it. The potatoe slices as always never let you down. Great tasting real lemonade to round it off and with great servers it was a pleasant way to sit out a dust storm."}
{"text":"The Food - Ordered tuna burger, and potato chips.   The tuna burger is different from what you would expect, but still tasty. The grain is mixed into the tuna, so it looks more like a thin turkey burger than a slice of seared tuna. The sauce is a bit more spicy than I was expecting and reminded me of Sriracha. Over all it tasted great!   The potato chips are essentially thick slices of potato with a chive-y sour cream like sauce on top. It was excellent!   The Atmosphere - parking is limited but we found a spot. The location is off of Campbell and 40th near LGO. The circular design is unique and beautiful. The inside is set up bar style with full view of the kitchen, cozy yet open. The outdoors is just as you would expect.   Service - we were greeted multiple times and invited to sit where we'd like. Everyone we interacted with was pleasant, and helpful. Our food did not take too long and neither did the check!   It's a great place to go for lunch or dinner for a quick meal, they have drinks as well.   Total bill for two people $30+ tip includes two non-alcoholic drinks, two burgers, and a side."}
{"text":"Jenny was our server and she was amazing! Great service all around. I'm a regular here who just comes for a good time and great food! The crispy chicken sandwich is the best in town and their post it note specials typically are incredible.  I tell all of my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The patio is great vibes especially during the winter when the weather is nice. As for the food, I modified the veggie burger and got it on a English muffin to make it vegan. I also got an order of the chips that came with this spicy green sauce. The server suggested the vegan BBQ sauce as a dip too! Sangria was refreshing and great suggestion. I will absolutely come here again and recommend this cute spot to anyone! It's not super common in Phoenix to come across restaurants with options for all dietary needs so I appreciate you Ingo!"}
{"text":"The perfect burger.  Cheeseburger,  with Strauss grass fed beef, medium well.  Perfect burger."}
{"text":"I have walked past this place probably a dozen or so times.  If I am down in this area, I am headed to Ingo's sister restaurant,  La Grande Orange,  for some pizza and baked goods.  I had always admired this beautiful, small, circular building, but I had never stopped in to try its food.  Recently, that changed!  I decided I would not cross the street to go to La Grande Orange, and instead, head here for a burger and some chips.  The pictures online and here on Yelp looked fantastic, and it was about damn time I tried everything out!    I drove down, parked in their overflow lot about a block down, and walked up to the joint.  A nice lady greeted me out on the patio and said that I could sit wherever I wanted.  I chose a nice little 2 top near a tree.  It was a beautiful 85 degree day out in Phoenix today, so I got some sunshine and shade all in one with the seat I chose.  I studied the menu for a bit and then placed my order.  I went with an order of Shattered Chips, a Paris Texas Burger (upgraded $1.00 to the grass fed beef) with no lettuce, and a glass of water to drink.  About 10 minutes later, my food was brought out to the table.  Here is how everything was............  Shattered Chips-  Um....FANTASTIC!  The word \"fantastic\" doesn't even really do them justice though. These \"chips\" are really thin sliced potatoes, deep fried to a golden brown, crunchy, yet still soft and chewy inside, piled high and then topped with some Lebni (pretty much a sour cream with a taste of lemon).  These chips also came with a little cup of green stuff that looked like salsa.  I took a bite of my first chip and was blown away at how great they were!  This was one of the best versions of ANY potato product I have ever had!  I dipped my chips in the Lebni and it was heavenly.  Next up, I dipped a chip in the green stuff.  WOW!   Taste explosion!  My waitress came around, and I asked what the green stuff was.  She told me that it was fermented/pickled jalapenos!  This stuff was awesome!  Tasted great, and packed just enough heat.  She told me that they were eventually going to bottle and sell that stuff.  I would buy it in a heartbeat!  It was a great compliment to the cold, smooth Lebni dip and the perfectly fried chips!  I would come back here again just for these chips...maybe order a take out container full of them.  They were flat out awesome! 5+ Stars!   Paris Texas Burger-  This burger came with a grass fed patty cooked perfectly medium, some cheddar cheese, some Nueskes bacon, pickles and some apple bbq sauce.  It usually comes with lettuce, but I left that off of there.  The only place lettuce belongs, is in a salad ;-).  This burger was presented very nice.  It was cut in half and held together by long toothpicks.  I took a bite and was pretty impressed.  The bbq sauce kind of overpowered everything, but it was still delicious and you could tell it was a high quality burger. The Nueskes bacon is awesome btw!  The grass fed beef itself was very tasty!   Maybe not the best burger I have ever had, but still a solid 4 star burger on its own.  I finished my meal, paid my check (just under $15.00)  and then walked inside.  Sitting there on the counter is a huge glass container full of mini sea salt chocolate chip cookies!  Yes, the same ones that they make and sell at La Grande Orange, only about 1/10th the size.  These cookies are like crack...I always have to get one whenever I go to La Grande Orange.  Perfectly crunchy, moist, gooey, salty and flat out delicious.  I grabbed about 5 of them, put them on a napkin and was on my way back to my car.  What a nice touch to end your meal!  Service was excellent!  All 3 of the ladies I interacted with were super friendly and helpful!  I will definitely be heading back here sooner than later.  Maybe a pizza from La Grande Orange across the street and an order of chips from here might hit the food jackpot, eh?  Wash it down with some mini sea salt cookies?  That, my friends, might be a perfect meal!  I will definitely be trying that combo out in the next month or so.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for an outdoor dinner. Well, when it's not 120 degrees out that is. It has a great atmosphere and great service. I loved the chicken sandwich and the sangria!"}
{"text":"Ingo's runs with the major players in the heart of the most infamous burger-trap hood around. From the platinum shine to the grill, you'd never know that underneath all that flash, Ingo's ain't packin' heat.   Food-wise, I mean... The cold double stack of gritty, unmelted orange cheddar on 3/3 burgers (veggie, Paris Texas, & kids' meal status) was peeled off. The famous english muffin was dry (WHAT THIS IS, LGO COME ON) but not toasty or warm, and the regular bun was even more forgettable. It was reported as \"way too mushy\" by a high schooler who ordered meat & cheese on bread. This should not be a recipe for mushiness (nor should it be a recipe at all... but I digress.) What could've used a little less heat: any part of the patio lacking shade.    The remaining patio, however, is the beez kneez. We table-hopped to safety and enjoyed the beautiful weather to the sounds of rasta-hip-hop blaring from overhead, further enhancing our summer-in-February vibes with reasonably tasty mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches. The only element more impressive was the thumb-indented water cups... the ultimate drinking experience. Surrounded by puppies and gentle Arcadians, I thought, \"patio game strong,\" though I can't say the same for the food experience.    A player must stay on their grind in these parts, and with so much competition less than a bun's throw away, Ingo's shade isn't enough to pull me away from the streets."}
{"text":"I've been hearing how yummy this place is for quite awhile and I finally got to try it on a beautiful afternoon. First and foremost, parking can be a challenge as it's very limited but there's complimentary valet right across the street.   I sat on the patio to enjoy the weather and was greeted very quickly. My friend Taylor ordered a Greyhound cocktail and it was really tasty, sour from the grapefruit and cool from the mint. A great cocktail for a warm afternoon.  Taylor and I then ordered the Fresh Shattered Potato Chips. Now you might be thinking crunchy, actual potato chips but don't let the name fool you. Ingo's puts their own spin on a \"potato chip\" and serves up potatoes cut somewhat thinly, so their's still actual potato inside the \"chip\". See my posted picture for a visual. The aioli they serve up with the potato chips complements the overall flavor. The combo is mouth watering! Salty, soft & crunchy, with a kick of lemon.   Next we ordered the Farmer's Daughter Burger and the Crispy Chicken Sammie. If you like dijon and sauerkraut, go for the burger! The burger was so juicy, they make a perfectly cooked burger. The Crispy Chicken Sammie was a light sandwich, even for being crispy chicken. It's not greasy whatsoever. The apple on the sandwich adds a nice refreshing touch. Then the spicy aioli balances it all out. It's Ingo's take on a buffalo chicken sandwich but it's ten times better!  When our check arrived, so did three little cookies that were complimentary. I wish I had a whole basket of those cookies because they were chewy and buttery, finished off with some sea salt.   Overall, pleasant experience with incredibly satisfying food!!"}
{"text":"The Boy and I decided to try Ingo's for their 4th of July Special, $4 burgers.  I have warred with this place since it was built and took away the already scant parking for LGO and Postino's but I think it's time to wave the white flag and concede to Ingo's Tasty Food.  The place is small and quaint, inside is diner counter style eating with a nice shady patio outside.  The menu is, well, small, but we enjoyed what we had.  We started with the Post It Special of the day, Avocado Toast with Burrata, Heirloom Tomatoes, Grapes, Shallots, and Basil on Noble bread.  It was crazy delicious but the portion size was tiny for the $8 price tag.  Just once slice of bread with toppings.  Our burgers were very good, I had the Farmer's Daughter sans sauerkraut and The Boy had the Paris TX Burger.  The Shattered chips were just ok.  I like crispy, thin, potato chips and these were thick and soggy with some and thin and crispy with others.   What really won me over is the complimentary bite sized Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookie they bring you at the end of your meal.  I mean I still went over to LGO and bought the large version to take home but it was a nice ending to a meal to satisfy a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"The seasonal frozen rita is amazing - tequilla, lime, pomegranate, winter spices- soo good. Still one of my favorite places for lunch/dinner - cant go wrong with any of their burgers or salads."}
{"text":"Great greyhound.... Terrible service.  We got one drink, waited 30 min and no one came back. The servers looked to be chaotic but so disappointing since LGO is my favorite. Too bad we didn't get to eat the food.... Or get anyone to come back."}
{"text":"A super delish Arcadia spot!  Love the food, attentive service and sense of community!  Support this local spot with the best music ever!  From grass fed burgers to shattered potato chips, it's simply ingolicious!  I could seriously drink the jalapeño green sauce!   Chef Richard is the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food is great and the staff is very friendly. I recommend the kale salad."}
{"text":"The Paris, TX burger and shattered chips are absolutely amazing!  I've never eaten such a wonderful cloud of a burger in my life.  Highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"Ohhhh yes. After coming here for the Yelp event, I knew I would be back, but I wasn't sure that it would be consistently good (I would guess a restaurant would try to be top notch for an event). That being said, this was just as good as the first time on our second trip. We went on a beautiful Phoenix winter day (70's and partly cloudy...ahhh) and sat on their lovely patio. We got the chips (which they had run out of at the event) and they were pretty amazingly delicious. They are crispy, but not too crispy and the sauce pairs with them perfectly. Additionally, I got a side of their wonderful and amazing jalapeno sauce....so good on just about everything....especially the chips. YUM! We also each got a Paris Texas burger....very tasty stuff. I like that they make their prosciutto crispy....I have never had it that way, and it is wonderful. The food here is pretty substantial too, ate it for a late lunch and was too full to eat again all night. I would say that this place doesn't have my favorite burger in town, but it is in my top 3. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My son had a basketball game close so we went to yelp and picked this spot. It was great.  They make their own chips and the burgers were wonderful.  Their jalapeno hot sauce was the bomb!  And a free cookie as you leave!!  Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"The most amazing customer service ever. Went above and beyond to accommodate my requests, and recently updated their water filtration system. Best burgers in town. James Beard winning taste with fast food pricing. Great atmosphere for a date or just a nice lunch out."}
{"text":"So....this should be a 5 star review because the food was VERY tasty! I had the veggie burger which was so good! The veggie patty was fresh and made in house..and the vegan cheese was awesome as well. If you go here, definitely get their potatoes as they're delicious and served with fermented jalapeños.   Ok, so why the 3 stars? My friend ordered a drink and there was still lipstick on his glass. Gross! The food is good but I question the cleanliness of the restaurant after this incident. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Their service is pretty lame. They have a lot of young girls that should not be in the service industry. It took them over 30 minutes to get to drinks to us. And never came back. We have been there over three times and every single time there's service is slow."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good service. We went with the Yelp recommendations and tried the shattered chips, Paris/Texas burger and the fish club sammy. All were extremely delicious! The free cookies at the end were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Cute little place! Wish the seating was a little better on inside. With that being said..probably one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had in a long time. The chicken was crispy yet super moist. The apple really gives it a nice crunch and freshness. I got mine without pickles but they are usually served with the sandwich. The potato chips/ fries came out hot and crispy. I would opt to have the dip on the side. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great little spot off Campbell and 40th street.  Excellent little diner style restaurants with an interesting menu with a daily happy hour Monday through Friday 11 to 7. Good craft beers on tap. Wroth checking out. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We have already been big fans of the burgers over at LGO, so it was no surprise to be impressed at Ingo with the same deliciousness. The set up is a little unusual with the order window towards the back of the venue, but I like the seating layout a lot. It's fun to sit outside and soak up some sun or lounge in the shade with a brew and some taters.  The food itself was fabulous. The crushed potatoes with labne were extremely tasty - even more so than I had imagined with the wonderfully distinct dip. I thought it was going to taste like any other sour cream or ranch dip, but it was something beautiful in its own right. I enjoyed the tuna burger - the burger itself was pretty good with plenty of avocado a soft spice. I added extra with their homemade fermented jalapeno sauce (totally awesome!). The buns were remarkable with just enough softness to not be mush when you bite. My companion tried the Ingo burger and reported the bun to be a slightly mushy with the saurkraut and mustard sauce dripping on it.  The service was friendly and timely. But the only reason I'm docking a star  is because they've removed the veggie burger. LGO's veggie burger has been my FAVORITE in the valley. I tried ordering it at LGO itself about a week prior to visiting Ingo and was told they no longer have it at the pizzeria, because it's on the Ingo menu. When I ask for it at Ingo, they've taken it off the menu... Do I want a rice bowl? F*&% no I don't want a rice bowl at a burger joint. Please bring my veggie back."}
{"text":"Ingo's is legit.  I'll even say I like it better than the more famous LGO across the street.  Great prices on drinks (try the greyhound!), killer chips and dip (couldn't stop devouring the greek yogurt sauce... and the jalapeno sauce... and the BBQ sauce that our waitress brought us to sample), and probably the best Paris Texas Hamburger and Chicken Sammy that I've ever had.  The atmosphere is great, especially when it's winter and it gets dark a bit early.  We had a great time sitting out on the patio drinking and enjoying the gorgeous weather and delicious food via candlelight.  Portions are a little small but are priced accordingly, so you actually walk out with a little lighter body and a little heavier wallet than you would normally have after a nice dinner out.  100% will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I go at least twice a month.  Can't say enough about the food for the price.     Have sampled most of the menu and everything is well composed and executed (flavor, texture, seasoning, etc.).  I think my only complaint is I like my cheese a little more melted on my burger...  There is no salamander so I get the constraint.  Maybe throw it on the flat top for a few seconds before putting on burger?  Fish and chicken sandwiches are amazing... Take a break from burgers and order one.. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I just found my sweet spot on the menu!  Crispy Chicken Sammy!!!  My second visit here, and again, I sat inside at the not too busy hour of 2:15.  Service, just as before, was rapid and friendly.  I had done my research, and already had a plan, so I didn't need to figure out the menu options this time.  I also already grasped the concept, and that the prices related to quality, organic, local ingredients.  I even knew what the numbers on the floor were for, although I didn't need to use them. (They are so if you are waiting for a seat, you know the order in which you get to be seated.  Pretty clever.)  I am now hooked on their Crispy Chicken Sammy.  They marinate their chicken breast in buttermilk, and pound it to make it super tender.  Then, it is lightly battered, deep fried, and served up juicy, crispy and tender on a bun with pickles, slices of granny smith apple (it works) and spicy aioli.  This is a sandwich that I intend to have frequently.  It is madly perfect.  Also to die for are the deviled eggs.  I wasn't sure how I would like the beets, but there are just a few pieces diced on top of each egg, and they work perfectly.  The eggs themselves were light, perfectly seasoned and piled high with deliciousness.  My shattered potato chips were perfect, and having the lebni on the side was the right way to go for me.  This trip, I added a Sangria to my meal, and it was just the right touch.  I also ordered a nice little house salad with goat cheese and sunflower seeds that I hadn't noticed on my last visit, and it struck me as a generous portion for the price.  Although I'm curious about other items on the menu, I think that I know what I will be eating here for awhile...Crispy Chicken Sammy, Deviled Eggs and Sangria.  I may eventually get around to trying something else, but I can't imagine a better meal."}
{"text":"If you like delicious food and great service, this is the place for you. Their menu is simple yet perfect. Their burgers are juicy and full of flavor. My all time favorite is the Paris Texas Burger and the Black Bean Burger. Highly recommend the potatoes. The green dipping sauce is to die for!  The service is also what keeps bringing us back. Everyone is so attentive and great with suggestions. My drink was never empty and they were so fast to help out any time I even looked up."}
{"text":"Best patio?!? lgNo!! Over priced, small portions (which match the tiny space review...)No pkg...nothing tasty bout that...ps nice clock lol"}
{"text":"My love letter to Ingo's:  INGO'S! I love you. Your food is so amazing and delicious. Burgers are cooked to a perfect medium and seasoned so well. Egg salad is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Perfect for brunch. Kale and quinoa salad is so light and refreshing. Sangria is lovely, especially in the beast that is Phoenix weather. Deviled eggs, shattered potato chips, and hummus and pumpkin seed dip - best way to start a meal. Ice cream sandwich cookies and complimentary sea salt chocolate chip cookies - even better way to end a meal. Super fun seating with nice shade. FAST AND EFFICIENT SERVICE! Good prices. Good food. Fin."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  The service was great and quick.  It's a little small and maybe not the best for larger groups but definitely nice for a daytime date."}
{"text":"Happily breezed through a critical interview that morning, so my husband took me here to day drink and grub. Ingo's is a super cute corner cafe, with nice patio seating that I wish I could've enjoyed today, had I brought another sweater with me. Playlist is mellow and feel-good, and service was pleasant.  It was Happy Hour, so my 2 cocktails were only $6 each. The Ingo's Greyhound is a pretty pink drink with a great grapefruit flavor. Their moscow mule tasted quite unique because of the rather strong muddled ginger. It sort of worked for me, but I don't imagine it would for the usual mule drinker. Hubby had the Ska Brewery Modus Hoperandi IPA for $5.  Our food was BANGIN'! Hubby had the Paris Texas Cheeseburger and I had the Crispy Chicken Sammy ($8.50 whaaaattt). Don't let the sandwich sizes fool you! Both were so juicy and flavorful, you'll be comfortably satisfied at the end of the meal. Oh, and those thick-cut potato chips with ranch and salsa verde dips are awesome to share and start with."}
{"text":"Ingo's - I really like your food, your service, your beer, your everything... but I HATE your flies!! There has to be something that can be done to keep the little pests out of my plate of food. It was nightmarish. I had the veggie burger and loved it, especially on one of the LGO English muffins. Very nice selection. Fries, and sides are all good, and the beer choices were excellent. Great vibe - get rid of the flies!!"}
{"text":"Love love love LGO and Ingo's! Food is A++ service is too! Not a ton if indoor seating so in the summer it's better to go at night. Burgers are OHMYGOSH WOW!! I highly recommend...well...everything!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a late Sunday afternoon, there was four other people in the restaurant . The restaurant is small and maybe holds up to 20 inside in a semi circle bar/table. I do a take out order and sit down to wait and then a large group of 7 comes in to sit so I give up my seat so they could sit together and the waitress thanks me and tells me to sit and as I sit this idiot in the group that sat in the seat I gave up asked me to move so he could sit next to his friend which there was a seat between his friend and I. Wanted to put my fist in his food since I gave up my seat previously and he was so ungrateful.   This led to my displeasure for my experience here.  I ordered the Ingo Burger with a fried egg which I specifically asked to not have sunny side up. As I opened my food later the first thing I see is a burger with a sunny side up egg. Also ordered the fresh shattered potato chips they were pretty good but the dipping sauce seemed a little off . Overall the food was average at best the service was average and the idiot in the restaurant was like a grade school punk . With all the quality restaurants in that area that will be the last time I will eat here"}
{"text":"We are LGO frequenters and we watched as they built this place just across the street for a few months so I'm not sure why it has taken us this long to try it!  This past Sunday we met another couple for a late lunch around 2pm. Luckily there was plenty of parking spaces because as other regulars know, parking in this area during peak times can be a bit stressful.   The inside is cute but pretty small with seats at the bar and only a few tables. Since it was beautiful outside, we decided to sit out on the patio and they definitely had more seating outside, though the gravel was a bit of an odd chose for patio flooring. When sitting outside, you order at the window on the north side of building and then take your number to your table where they deliver it.  I ordered the Ingo burger without the bun, with the yuzu berry iced tea. My fiance got the Paris Texas burger and the other couple both got the cheeseburger. We also shared an order of the shattered potato chips. The tea came in a bottle and was really good, it did taste more like a green tea though and I doubt there are free refills but I didn't ask. I probably would have ordered a Diet Coke in a can when I saw someone else with one but didn't see it on their menu, only a Coke with cane sugar so it would have been nice to have it listed.   The cheeseburgers were delivered all at the same time and they were all really good. My fiance literally moaned every bite he took of his Texas burger. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. I had to try it after a comment like that and while good, I've had a few better so maybe he was just really hungry. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the best ever in my opinion. The chips were really good and fresh and the accompanying dip was good too, different.   One other note, several people brought their dogs. I am a HUGE dog lover and would typically be a fan of being able to bring your dogs to a patio but the seats are pretty close to each other and the couple next to us had a long leash and I definitely felt like the dog was part of our lunch. Not something I'm into at a restaurant. They did try and watch him but it's still interrupting when the dog barked at other dogs or  when others petted the dog, you could see the hair flying in the breeze...enough to make me worry about getting it on my food and that's pretty gross.   All in all, I would come back here on a nice day and enjoy the patio and hope only shed free dogs were around."}
{"text":"This review is really 3.5 stars.  With some improvements, Ingo's can be a solid 4 or even a 4.5.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the parking is abysmal and the inside is small... and depending on time of day on the patio, you may be blinded by the setting sun.  I don't hold these things against Ingo's, just the LGO architects.  I've been here a few times, and am always pleased with the quality of the food.  There are two areas that could use improvement: Service, and beer.  The service is generally good, but sometimes is slow and they don't always get any custom requests done correctly (like not cutting the burger in half).  For Beer:  I would a) like to see a larger beer selection and more importantly b) stop serving the beer in a crappy plastic pilsner glass.  You might as well serve it to me in a sippy cup.  If you are afraid of people breaking glass, I don't know what to tell you?  But the small-ish size and the fact it is a lightweight plastic just seems odd."}
{"text":"Yesterday was \"Burger Monday\" in my world, and we heard good things about Ingo's so we finally got around to trying it out for lunch.  I was expecting a burger place, but it was not nearly as focused on burgers as I thought it would be from hearing about it.  I think there were a few options in that department    The building's atmosphere is super cool and unique, which felt right in place across from Postino and LGO at 40th and Campbell.  We (5 dudes) sat at the counter inside in a linear fashion and it was a bit cramped, but not so bad that it ruined the experience - we moved on from the topic in a mere 10 seconds.    I ordered the gourmet burger with Pancetta, medium-rare, along with a side of their \"chips\".  To me, fries are just as important as the burger, but \"chips\" were the option.  They need to come up with another name for this offering, because the words \"chips\" sells them very short!  They're more fry than chip, but I'm glad I ordered anyway.  The only suggestion I would make is a smaller portion option, so one can get out with a little cheaper lunch tab, and not gorge themselves on spuds!  The burger arrived and it was amazing - nothing really else to discuss on the topic.  Enough said - Ingo's is a winner!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's a cute little spot, with some healthy food options and a small menu. I was pretty disappointed for several reasons.  First and most importantly, the food just wasn't as good as I had expected. We ordered a fish sandwich and a burger and split them. We also tried the chips and lebni appetizer. The hot sauce/ salsa served with the chips was awesome, way better than the lebni. I didn't enjoy the lebni at all, it was so lemony, but maybe that's what lebni is supposed to taste like? I'm not sure. The burger wasn't good at all. While it was juicy, it didn't taste seasoned. It tastes like plain hamburger meat which wasn't appetizing to me at all. The bun was delicious, which was a nice surprise. It was soft and fluffy with poppy seeds on top. The fish sandwich had a large batter coating with little fish. The fish that was there was pretty strong. It didn't taste fresh. On top of it all there were flies buzzing around inside landing on us and our food which was super annoying. The manager saw us batting at the flies and didn't try to take care of them. The service wasn't great either, we had to ask for everything: napkins, refills, check, etc. however they were friendly, just not attentive."}
