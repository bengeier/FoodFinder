{"text":"The drinks were great, and the service was acceptable - but the nachos were poor for a 'Gastro Pub'"}
{"text":"This place has a great craft beer lineup with mostly Ontario breweries, and a couple from Quebec and internationally thrown in too. The bottle and can selection is pretty interesting and worth checking out.

The bartender was very good at helping me choose something different from the bottle selection. I ended up going with Derniere Volonte from Quebec's Dieu du Ciel, a really interesting Belgium style beer.

The menu is your standard comfort foods. I had the lamb burger which was good and the kettle chips were a nice change from fries.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable. There are three different sections to the bar so if you are looking to watch the game head towards the back where there are a lot more TVs."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood, and started going to Stout a few months ago and had such a great experience that it has now become our \"local\" where we go for an after work drink, or with friends for a night out, and sometimes for special occasions such as Father's Day where we'll have meals. 

The beer menu is constantly changing as they get in craft beers, and international beers that are always interesting. I was surprised to find that I could get beer from my old hometown of Burlington as well as Oakville next door - all the way to beers from around Ontario, Quebec (some excellent ones) and from around the world. I like that they normally use the traditional glasses used for the particular beers (hefeweissen glasses for hefeweissen beer, glasses from the particular brewers of the beer etc.). The variety of on-tap and bottled beers is excellent, and I usually try one new beer each time we go. 

The service has always been excellent with very friendly (and knowledgeable) servers who seem genuinely happy to be there, and Erin (the very cheerful owner) ensuring that the service and drinks/food are all ok and that everyone is happy.  

We are vegetarians, and appreciate that there are a few selections for us (many pubs have just one, token veggie meal - but Stout has a few options which is great so that we don't get bored). The food we've had has been excellent, and the portions are substantial (sometimes we find it's better to just split a dish between the two of us instead of one each - unless we're particularly famished). 

On one occasion, some friends were with us and one of the meals wasn't cooked fully (the only time in the 15 or 20 times we've been there) - but once the staff were alerted to it, they immediately apologized, took it back and created a new meal (I suspect that most places would have tried microwaving it, but in this case they created the meal from scratch again to ensure it was correctly done and handled it very professionally). 

There are various areas of the pub and each are very inviting and comfortable (front room with fireplace/comfy seats/windows on to the street, the bar area, the back seating area and the patio). Sometimes the TV screens can be a bit distracting for me with sports channels playing all of the time (vs. for special events) but I think a lot of people prefer to have something like that in the background so I don't mind too much especially since the volume is turned off. 

I recommend Stout to friends and neighbours alike. When we have people visiting and we feel like going out in the neighbourhood - this is where we go."}
{"text":"My friend and I had just seen a movie and were really happy. Then we went here - the restaurant. 

We ordered with our eyes - a Mexican bean dip and tortilla chips along with tasty bucket of fries. What could possibly go wrong? 

Personally I've always loved cream cheese. Fancy or philly it didn't matter. And yet when Lance placed the \"Mexican\"  bean dip platter in front of us and I dunked my first burnt piece of pita into that hot cheesy ooze I knew I'd been duped. 

You see the thing about cream cheese is it's not Mexican, it's Hungarian (Europe). So you can imagine the internal let down. 

We had to tell Lance. 

When he was done with the other table's fork drop he popped his butt over to our table to ask how \"everything was going\". Not good Lance, not good. We couldn't  lie anymore, the truth had to come out. 

Lance took all the cream cheese off the bill, sorry \"Mexican food\". What a guy! He even brought some tips over for a board game we were playing. Yes, the resto also has entertainment. 

His news about our board game wasn't great though \"this game needs more than two players\". But hey, a good restaurant just needs one player. Thanks Lance, you're a true player."}
{"text":"While the beer might be slightly overpriced, the atmosphere is really great. They have an awesome selection of board games (which is always a great way to spend your time before your food shows up or play while having some drinks) and a pretty good menu."}
{"text":"Just excellent! We were a group of three moms with strollers and despite us taking up lots of extra space the server was very accommodating. He offered highchairs, bottle warming, and even asked if we would need a kids menu (though our babies were all too young). The food was served quickly and was delicious! We were all very happy with our experience, especially when the previous place we went to (and walked out of) was quite unwelcoming due to our three strollers. Great place to eat with little ones!"}
{"text":"Great food! I love the hell's chicken sandwich! The staff are nice, especially the gentleman who works on the weekdays during the lunch hour, I've brought my son and my friends have brought their children and he is extremely accommodating! Great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Really great food, friendly staff, and just an epic selection of beers!!! Be aware that it's not the cheapest place to go for a pint though..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a genuine neighbourhood pub, look no further!  Stout Irish Pub is as inviting as a friendly neighbour should be.

The beer selection is definitely good - but what is even better is their knowledge of the beers they serve.  Staff are friendly and you feel welcome immediately.  This is a place that has board games stacked at the entrance.  You and your friends can grab a game, find a table, order some great pub grub and a beer and then settle in for an evening of unhurried conversation and entertainment.  

If you hit the right night, you will find quiz nights, tastings and even the occasional pyjama party!

The decor is definitely warm - lots of exposed brick - a fireplace - comfy chairs and multi-level.  The vibe is good - lots of animated laughter and chatter.  

I love to sit at the bar and talk to the bartender - it is always a lesson in beers.  I can't say I really knew much about beer before finding Stout, but I have most certainly learned a lot since then.  If you are looking for a taste adventure, get a taster of 4 - and if you are brave, ask the bartender to select for you!  You will be pleasantly surprised - I have never been disappointed.

Deep fried pickles!  Oh my goodness!  They are amazing.  Remember, this food is pub food - not especially what you will want if you are on a diet.  If you are hungry and looking for great comfort food, then you have found the right spot.

Stout Irish Pub has improved our neighbourhood!  It has developed a following of regulars who appreciate what it has to offer."}
{"text":"You kidding me? This is one of the best kept secrets in Toronto. The food and bar selection is fantastic - I think the tap selection is one of the best in the city. 

The Stout also has a great side patio for summer use, which is completely private and great for a relaxing afternoon of beverages with friends. 

The staff here cares about their regulars and are always welcoming to new guests. Cheers to Erin and her team for creating a fantastic environment in an area of the city which desperately needed one."}
{"text":"Stout is a solid choice for good pub food!
Cozy atmosphere in the winter and a cute patio in the summer, service is good!
I was disappointed in the brunch I had there recently but I've always enjoyed the dinner options."}
{"text":"Nice place!
Super food and friendly people. We had some of the special local brewed beers.
I had the wild caught cod. Marvellous!
Would go here again for sure."}
{"text":"First pub we went to in Toronto! 

We were there on Trivia Night, which for a nerd like me, is awesome to stumble upon. (Side note: Trivia Nights are on Tuesdays and Thursdays)

Like what the reviewers have been saying, they've got a great selection of beer. Some on tap, some aren't. Depending on your mood of the day, you can get an IPA, ale, anything you want really. I was really missing the readily available St. Ambroise abricot beer from Montreal, so I just ordered that. But my friend ordered the Hawaiian beer, and he really enjoyed it.

The atmosphere there was really friendly, our server was funny, it's a really nice break after a long day/week of work.

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Stout, despite a few misses, because the food is always good, the staff are always friendly and when there is a miss - they make up for it! Not a fan of their Trivia night (Tuesdays) because it's MADNESS!! and usually leads to bad service because they are so so busy. But on any other day of the week it's a great place for a burger (so good) or a fish and chips (not my thing but bf looooves it) and a few pints or glasses of wine. The last time I was in I had a 9oz glass of wine - because that's how I roll!! And it wasn't really cold enough - the server brought me a vessel - I don't even know what to call it - to put my sidecar of extra wine, that wasn't in the glass, on ice to keep it cold until I got to it. It's the little things that make service good and the little touches that keep me coming back. Thanks, Stout!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Excellent choice of beer. One problem is they don't have all the beer in stock and I had to drink my 3rd choice which they ran out of  by the end of the night. Food menu is limited and not that great. 
Server was despondent and I got the feeling he didn't want to be there but my friends insisted that he was really a nice guy and this was an off night for him."}
{"text":"The 5-star rating for this visit is driven primarily by atmosphere and service.

We happened to be downtown, early on a Saturday evening.  Not super hungry but looking for a good place to have a drink and chat.  We'd both been to Stout in the past, but it's been a while.  Remembering their great selection of beers, and hoping we wouldn't be waiting in a line to get in, we popped over.  Such a good decision.

We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately at a small table in the cozy front room.  Our server, Anne, stole the show for the evening.  First off, she was genuine and clearly enjoyed what she was doing.  Her knowledge of the beer menu helped to guide our first beer choice, and her recommendations were spot-on.  Only a few minutes into our beers, we realized that the front door was creating a bit of a cold draft and with perfect timing, the couple seated in front of the fire in comfy chairs just happened to be leaving.  We approached the hostess who happily cleared the table and invited us to move.

What was probably going to be a quick beer and a snack became a relaxed, cozy, yummy evening in front of the fire.  The nachos we ordered were nothing special, but were a perfect compliment to our beers.  We polished them off and then my partner wandered over to the bookshelf full of board games.  After pulling one game out and then almost putting it back, Anne appeared and reassured him that it was a great game (The Duke) and perfect for two people.

It was.  In fact, we're going to buy it.  Best of all, Anne gave us a quick overview of the rules and a few pieces of advice and off we went.  Along came a second round of great beers and then we decided to try the bourbon barbecue wings. Fantastic wings!  What an enjoyable evening of great beer, tasty pub food and a fun board game.  Best of all was our server, Anne.  Thanks Anne, for making our evening special! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you are in need of a local watering hole look no further. Amazing selection of beer and really fun and friendly staff. They have regular events like pub trivia and holiday themed parties. If you are looking to try new brews, catch the hockey game or meet up with friends Stout Irish Pub is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've been to Stout a few times now and both times I left feeling like I should have gotten more for my buck. The food is adequate, they have a solid beer menu, the service is fine, and they have a few gimmicks if that's what you're looking for (board games, trivia nights, live music sometimes).

There's not a lot to complain about, it's just not especially unique or interesting. If given the choice, I'd prefer to spend my time at House on Parliament around the corner or try out any of the several new restaurants popping up in the area."}
{"text":"As someone who appreciates a wide range of beer, the selection here is unreal. Porters, stouts, ales, pilsners.. They have a beer for everyone. They also have board games up at front and the snack food is decent. The atmosphere is cozy, there are TV's usually displaying sports games. A great place for people who are looking to explore beer."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times. As Irish pubs go this one is pretty great. The food is a better quality than I've personally experienced at similar places( It's still pub food though). We tried the Lamb burger. The beer selection and atmosphere is what really earns this place a 5-star rating in my book. There is a fair bit of space inside if you are coming in with a bigger group (4-6 people)"}
{"text":"For a simple Irish pub in a neat neighborhood, the food is to die for. We were in town for a couple of baseball games and found the Stout Irish pub on Yelp. The reviews and the fact is was not a tourist trap, made us consider the place. Brittney, our server, was a delight and informative about the menu. She recommended the beet salad and we wanted onion rings for an appetizer (6 of us). It was perfect. The meals were just outstanding. The Murphy's stew was rich and flavorful, the Shepherd Pie full of amazing Lamb and great presentation (not your momma's casserole). We even met the chef and thanked her for a wonderful dinner. When we come to Toronto again, we will be back."}
{"text":"I have a crush on Stout.

We were looking for a bar walking distance to the Phoenix when I stumbled upon the Stout.  Lucky me.

The menu includes a great selection of classic pub grub dishes - everything from fish & chips to mac n cheese. I would recommend the fish & chips to lovers of beer batter. Huge portion and extremely tasty.

The service is friendly and prompt. Happy to substitute fries for salad without charge or hesitation, and happy to turn on the Jays game upon my request. Many thanks.

Also - impressive beer list alert! 

Recommended (obv) and will return."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but it was great. Fantastic craft beer on tap and bottle, including seasonals and a rolling cask. I ordered the poutine and it was amazing, though too much for me to finish. Definitely a good spot for a few pints, or a casual after work dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a low value proposition. It's not particularly nice and all the pints are pricey. Feels like a fancy version of Brass Taps. If you're OK with chain restaurants, you'll probably like this place. Patio was pretty nice, had astro-turf and everything!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to catch a locally brewed beer and play some board games (decent selection with Settlers of Catan, and CAH etc). 

Downside is that the main level is very cold in the winter time, so you end up wearing your jacket. It's uncomfortable. The other two floors can have pretty loud music playing, so it's annoying trying to have a conversation (might as well be in a club). The games are not so well stacked....it would be nice if they had a better shelving system to get games out so that things don't fall on top of you."}
{"text":"Good drink list but very expensive. I have never had a great meal here, but go for the great beer list and trivia nights at this cozy neighbourhood bar."}
{"text":"i would highly recommend this place, everyone was just so friendly and the food was delicious. they have a wall of board games for you to play while you wait, which i thought was neat... my friend & I split the poutine to start (which the gravy was SO good, our waiter told us it was home made) then she ordered the Mac&Cheese which she really liked, i got the Hells Chicken Sandwich but put onto a wrap with a side salad...very good. i would highly recommend this place to anyone, next time I'm in the area i will for sure be making a pit stop."}
{"text":"Stout is way more packed than one would think. Turns out it is a hot spot for the area. So naturally, for one of my last nights in the neighborhood, some friends and I headed over to Stout. With it's restaurant-y feel, you forget that you can seat yourself! Go for it. 

We got a pitcher of a cider. Tried to find it on the website but the image was down. It was really good and perfectly worked out to three full pints. The beer list is enormous!

I got the pecan stuffed chicken! It was moderately priced and pretty good. The chicken and vegetables were nicely cooked. The buttery mashed potatoes were delectable and great for mixing with other food items. My only qualm was that the pecan stuffing itself was SO salty. It was a real shock to the mouth with everything else that was going on in the dish. Didn't really get to taste the goat cheese either. 

The service was quite impeccable. Everything was always updated and on time. Sometimes it would be almost too good and you have a couple different people at a time checking in- kinda smothering. Stout is a great neighborhood hangout with lots of character, great tastes and great beers. I'd love to come in for one their weekly events once I'm back in the city."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews specifically about the availability of board games, I decided to try it out.
I really feel the owners need to drop the 'Pub' from the title. The feel is definitely not the standard Pub environment. It has a hipster lounge/cafe/restaurant feel that attracts friendly drinks/dinner dates. 

Alas, the selection of games are very few but still not half as bad as waiting for 2hours. In the cold. 

The entrance is main level and has a fireplace and piano to the far right end of the room. This gives a really cozy feel. Perfect for a quiet dinner on a cold evening. The all around wood furniture gives a warmth about the place. You can walk in and sit anywhere you like - which hones in on the casual atmosphere of a bar. While the staff and upstairs bar section brands a trendy spot with the plush couches and balcony setting overlooking the main quiet dining area. They have a wonderful balance of laid back and trendy. It might have something to do with the alluring candles or the super friendly staff.

The waiter was a lovely chap with a heavy accent. I couldn't make out exactly where he was from but it could've been Finnish. Nevertheless, he was very friendly and accommodated the 3 of us with menus and time to order. 

If this review was solely based on the menu, this place would get a straight 5. We all know too well that awkward moment when you plunge into the world of intimidating new selections at every restaurant, new and old. That moment where the blood rushes to and fro, brain and stomach. Trying to figure out what sounds good, wont dent your wallet and satisfies your papillae.  This place does JUST that. It presents max 6 options in each section. And not overtly complicated or fancy. If you wanted chicken, they have 3 selections that's it. For many that might be a half full type of adventure, but for me, it's efficient and practical. It's the krypton of turning me into a local - even if I reside in Mississauga. Perhaps I'm traditional in that sense but sometimes classics are not to be messed with. Don't come here expecting varieties. It's a bar. It serves Barf-ood options. For once you wont feel the churning. Well done boys. 

drinks: 
Fruili - woohoo. Strawberry beer? do you need more incentive to try this? 
Fruili
ginger-ale - bottomless refills - cool beans. 


App:
Poutine Sir - ($8.99) This is the standard poutine with the classic fries, cheese and smothered gravy. I cannot believe this place isn't known for the poutine. It is by far the greatest poutine I have had. With each fat french fry and melted cheese chunk dripping with gravy sauce - I mentally made a note to bring my Montreal friends here for dinner. Like mentioned, the french fries are fat and the serving is large so be sure to share. There wasn't as much cheese as I'd hoped but they really know how to spread that gravy bOi! . A delicious app to tease you into mains. 

Main:

Steak Sandwich - (13.99) This sandwich came on a francese bun (reminded me of the new square MacDonald's buns- uncomfortably wider than the meat) with a rosemary-radish aioli spread. Toppings included caramelised onions and fried mushrooms.  The steak is just really thin segments of meat that you cannot taste. It might be because of the large ratio of sweet caramelised onions and bread to the meat. The sweet flavour is throughout in this meal. I wasn't a big fan of it. The sides are either fries or salad. Sadly my buddy chose the salad - not knowing, at the time. how amazing the poutine was. You can add cheddar slice for 1.99 - which hardly seems worth it.  The portion is good enough for one. The side salad is not memorable . Not sure if it's not supposed to have dressing. It seemed bland. 


Hells chicken sandwich - ($12.49)  This was the only chicken sandwich on the menu but it's spicy so I opted against it. Mistake!
This is a really tasty sandwich if you are in the Sammy mood and prefer a light meal. Even with the bread, it's a deliciously light choice. The chicken is breaded with chilli spices so it's mainly dry. Toppings include tomato,cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and a light oil-chipotle spread.  You have the option of converting the classic samm-itch religion into a wrap for $0.99. The flavour is well balanced on the bread but I will def try the wrap next time.  My only complaint about this sandwich is that the dry ingredients tend to fall out. I like having all the items of my meal together, so I can relish all the different bits of gusto equally. 

Chicken Farfalle - ($14.99) This is a plate of bowtie pasta with chicken, fried spinach leaves,grilled and fried red onions and red peppers.The sauce is oil based which makes it extremely greasy. Not in a good way. I could barely taste the herbs because of how lubricated each piece was. The portion is large enough to share but the oil consistency was too much. I really think they should serve a side of bread. Myeh.
total= $85.73
The service was friendly&casual. Def will be returning.

{"text":"Great place with nice atmosphere and a huge selection of beer. They also have a nice fireplace and a selection of board games.

The food is good, although I wouldn't say it is fabulous. But definitely try this place for the beer and good vibes!  It's one of my go to pubs.

They also have a really great pub stumpers trivia. Be sure to bring a random assortment of things because they give out prizes to the first person to hand them the random thing they are looking for! (Also prizes for winning trivia, of course!)"}
{"text":"This is a great \"Irish\" pub that has a good atmosphere and serves decent food. I have been here for lunch and dinner on more than a few occasions, and it always hits the spot. The service is great and the staff are extremely friendly. 

There is a patio out back for the summer with large benches, perfect for socializing with a group of friends. I also love the open fireplace and the board games they keep on shelves for customers to play as they enjoy their drink.

Stout's lunch and dinner menu is excellent, and is always a reliable choice. My favourite is the Cajun chicken sandwich and I'm told their fish and chips is excellent too. 

The brunch, however, is only ok. I dropped by last weekend and had the eggs benedict. I found the home fries very tasteless and the eggs benedict was good but not great. I ordered it without spinach, but overall found it a bit bland.

Three stars for the brunch (will try something else for brunch next time) but a solid four stars for service, atmosphere and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Been coming her for years. A great bar in the Cabbagetown area. They have game nights and stuff always happening. There patio is cute, food is good bar food and they have a great beer list. Much love"}
{"text":"Was at Stout the other night, and it was as good as always. We had a new server, very friendly and helpful.
I must admit, I love this place.
An ever changing beer menu, and good staples while still doing interesting and always tasty specials.

Always a mixed crowding Wednesday we were in between the supper crowd and groups coming in from their evening leagues of whatever. 

Staff was hoping but still attentive,  timely, and friendly with time for jokes.

We've never had a bad experience here. Highly recommend for a casual pub experience."}
{"text":"Glad Stout is back.  Menu and quality fell off for a while but we are glad we tried it again and owner assures us new chef on board .  We were definitely impressed by the improvement.   Only thing is wine is too pricey by the glass - $10.00 for a basic Italian pinot grigio is pushing things a bit compared to other pubs in the area   Would suggest you reduce to competitve rates.   Other than that we are impressed by the turnaround."}
{"text":"Haha j'ai voulu tester ce bar qui proposait des soirées pub quizz comme on en connaît dans les pubs parisiens. Mais bon j'ai vite compris que si vous n'êtes pas élevé dans la culture canadienne, il est quasiment impossible de répondre aux questions.
Le Stout Irish Pub reste malgré tout un super bar servant une vingtaine de sortes de bières différentes et de très bonnes poutines.
Clientèle d'habitués ici venant toutes les semaines s'affronter à des sessions de pub quizz qui s'étalent sur plusieurs semaines."}
{"text":"Passed by this Pub and then recalled having it on my bookmarks so decided to drop in. 
It was the weekend and though I was running late for lunch I was expecting a crowd here. Surprisingly not much happening here and I walked around and spotted a patio. A small cozy space but nicely done. 
Beer list though impressive for draft is limited to mostly local stuff.
Bottled selection is a bit better but not much. Very few Belgian beers.They were serving the brunch menu when I arrived so after going through the menu ordered the french toast. I also ordered a flight of beer as I wanted to sample stuff.
Service was bit slow even though they were not busy.   
They gave out free scones which is appreciated. 
Maybe I chose the wrong beers as the flight was forgetful. Finally the french toast arrived. Impressive to look at it was huge cube of soft bread with some strawberry custard stuffing and side of maple syrup. Potatoes were cubed and fried. Taste was decent but not eggy enough.  So food is decent 
If they improve the service I would bump them half a star. 
3 Stars overall.  Odd area for a bar like this but I can see it being popular for this area."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The fish and chips were divine with a side of gravy. I was in Heaven!"}
{"text":"The biggest selection of cider I have ever seen at a pub. I don't drink beer ( if you do the selection is huge as well) so having more than one kind of cider available is a real treat! Only one is on tap but it's a good local one... Thornbury... Delicious. But if you are sick of that there are a whole bunch of other options in cans and bottles.

The food is fine. It seems they have changed the menu around a bit. There is a cheese board available now but not meat option. I have had lots of stuff here before but my most recent visit with a pal we just shared low key pub food... Chicken fingers and fries, very crispy but needed salt the fries were good I actually remarked they reminded me of chip truck fries not too thick tho.. Nice. 

It's a big place three separate sections and a nice low key patio with AstroTurf! Yup..."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and comfortable. Gets a little noisy when it's busy, but not a big deal. There's a variety of seating on 2 levels. There are TVs, if you're looking for sports, if not, there's BOARD GAMES! Every board game you can think of, even Cards Against Humanity.

The beer selection is fantastic. It's hard to pick. The beer menu is almost as large as the food menu. Nachos and perogies are pretty dang good with a few pints. It's got a great vibe and everyone is friendly. If you're in the area, drop in."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday after a meal at Kingyo. Nice little Irish spot in Cabbagetown. I had a Call if Cluthulu Stout that was delicious! Nice hints of fruit to cut the stoutness of the beer. The server was nice enough to give me both a sample of that and the red ale that I was debating between. Great little touch to help me make the right choice. I'd love to go back. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely welcoming feeling. The services is friendly and attentive. The beer menu is extensive and good quality. They have a whole wall of board games to keep you entertained."}
{"text":"Straight up pub food, but good straight up pub food. I actually crave their deep fried pickles. Damn, they're good. Excellent beer selection. Kinda love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, you can't really ask for more. Had a burger with onion rings. Among the best onion rings I've ever had, certainly among the tops in Toronto. Burger was excellent, nice, thick and juicy. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"What a great place!

I came here for their trivia night, which was AWESOME. 

The staff there is amazing... they're friendly and incredibly accommodating. They were so nice to us, even after we needed to change tables a few times as our group grew. 

The beer selection is also really fantastic. They have a ton of craft brews available, and the staff seem to really know their stuff.

The only complaint I may have is their food. It's not bad, it's just sort of generic pub food. I got wings and fries. The fries were HUGE and just a bit soggier/thick cut for my liking. The wings were also gigantic, but really really salty, and despite what the menu says, they only go up to \"hot\". I did taste some Moroccan spices on the wings, which I found pretty intriguing, but the saltiness made it really difficult for me to finish them.

It's sort of out of the way for me, but if I ever need a drink in the area, I'm definitely hitting this place again!

Oh and there's free wifi, you just need to ask for the password."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is a real Irish pub because they do have a massive beer selection, with so many varieties to numerous to even try to name. And it's not as if it's a dozen different types of lagers and pilsners either. They have a genuine variety of all types, including stouts of course and many adventurous offerings.

They ensure to have pub favourites on their menu, and even the shepherd's pie was real Irish-style being made with lamb. Being that they are in Cabbagetown, they're naturally going to have more modern options as well, including some vegetarian ones. I split their veggie burger and lamb burger (it may have said something like Greek-style) with a friend. The veggie burger actually comfortably won out, with a tasty well-seasoned black bean patty and fried jalapeño bites in it. i enjoyed the lamb burger, but was still a bit mildly disappointed with it - namely because the lamb was a bit too overcooked. The fries and chips were very good.

In spite of the place being packed out (for trivia night) we had great service with a friendly, attentive server who checked in on us regularly."}
{"text":"I've walked by here many times and recently read they had great shepherd's pie so we decided to try it out.  It was an OK experience - nothing overly exceptional to write about.

The atmosphere is nice - very cozy with a fireplace and some comfortable chairs.  When we walked in, I thought I would love the place.

We sat down and I quickly realized this visit was probably going to be mediocre.  First, for an Irish pub they have only two Irish beers which I find very odd.  Also, the food prices were fairly expensive for the area.

I had the shepherd's pie as desired and my friend had the butter chicken.  My pie arrived in a neat stacked fashion but I found it fairly bland and dry.  My friends butter chicken was relatively small in portion size.

Service wasn't exceptional and neither was the food.  Honestly, I doubt I'll be back.  Many more places to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Stout, it was a good Irish pub with a great beer section and some good local offerings. Two years later, the Stout has simply gotten better. The prices are a tad high for a poor grad student, but their offerings are incredible - a constantly changing beer menu, excellent service (everyone has been very attentive), and now, their food is just awesome. I mean, suburb, out of this world, however you want to put it. When I'm in the neighborhood, I come here. No question."}
{"text":"This is definitely a pub that I've been telling a lot of people about.  As someone who likes to try as many things as possible, how could I not love a place that offers a tasting tray of beer?  You can choose 4 beers from their extensive menu, and you'll get 5oz of each for only $7.50.  That's a deal I can get behind!  I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I still enjoyed trying it - even when I didn't like some of the choices I'd made.  My first choice was actually the worst - so I'm very glad I wasn't stuck with a pint of it!  I'm sure the server was a little annoyed to be serving a table of Yelpers, all of whom wanted the tasting tray - but she didn't show it, so she gets points for that.  The atmosphere is very laid back, and service was prompt even with our large and confusing order.  

All in all, a great bar to relax with some friends for a few hours, and have some beers.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"After having dinner at Kanpai just down the street we were looking for a place to have a few beers and Stout was the place.  This is one of the few places where the beer menu looks like a food menu and vice versa.  The food menu is a smaller black covered thin pamphlet compared to the beer menu which is a full blown, full sized, categorized, organized and graphically engineered piece of art.

OK maybe that description is a bit overkill but seriously... the beer menu is serious.  It may not be a Community's Annie Edison tabbed binder like what the Bier Markt has but this is actually easier to read and doesn't look like a prospectus and is easily first mistaken as a food menu until you actually look at it / read it.

I was able to quickly find my section for pale ales and went for one of my good old Burlington blue chips in a Nickel Brook Headstock.

Besides being livley, busy, and generally a happy all around place Stout has a shelf full of help yourself games to play.  We sat beside a bunch that was playing Trivial Pursuit while our little group was playing Cards Against Humanity.

For a casual time and good all around fun environment which is made even more fun with beer consumption... Stout is a great place to get together and laugh while you let your competitive spirit come through as well.

Things got pretty loud but it's all in good fun.  Most of it was because the game we were playing was hilarious."}
{"text":"It's not just a little teapot, nor short.  So glad to have found this place and shared with my fellow yelpers.  Situated in the heart of Cabbagetown, it's much more of  a local pub than an event bar.  Low key, not overly loud, but buzzing on a Friday night.  

Great beer menu that offers a taster choice of 4 beers for almost the same price as a regular pint.  

They even offer a variety of board games for you to pick up if you happen to have a hankering for games, and who doesn't?  From several Trivial pursuits to connect 4, it's all just sitting there for you to play when you walk in.    

Didn't try the food here yet, but that's on the to do for sure.

Hmm might just have to have a games night here fairly soon."}
{"text":"nice place to chill , eat , drink and play boardgames.

Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pub grub, with colorful salads and fresh craft beers. A homely little spot that's easily missed with dozens of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but definitely a standout with its offerings and exceptional service."}
{"text":"I had originally posted this in 2012 using a different Yelp account, and needed to merge accounts... here was my review from then:) 

Stout is a few minutes walk from Toronto's Gay Village, but, it is worth the walk.  

Tuesday night trivia nights are always a blast, everyone is friendly and it is a really a warm and accepting atmosphere.  There is eye-candy abounds (men and women), weekends provide for a fun lively atmosphere, and they even have boardgames!  Throwback!  LOVES IT!

I usually come for the food, and stay for many hours afterwards, due to the amazing people and fun times!  Definitely bring your friends (oh, and order the fish and chips - yum!)"}
{"text":"As of 30 Sept 2012, the best bar/restaurant experience that I have had in Toronto.  I had the black & blue burger, which is without a doubt, the best burger I have ever had in a restaurant.  It was perfectly seasoned with the blackening spice, and maybe the biggest surprise was how fantastic the bun was, I realize that they did not make the bun in house, that they purchase it from a local bakery, but smart move, this is what every other \"gourmet\" burger establishment in Toronto lacks, most places use cheap/terrible products that are brought in by either GFS or Sysco foods.  The only thing that would have improved the burger, is if the blue cheese was not stuffed inside the patty, this technique only works if you're serving your burger with some color in it (rare to medium), in this case, Stout only serves well done burgers, and the most of the cheese turns to a liquid with no consistency whatsoever because the internal temperature is too high.  The french fries here are fantastic, good size, not too thin, and prepared with care.  During the summer, they featured St. Ambroise Framboise, which is a terrific beer, not overly sweet which is the biggest flaw to many fruit beers.  The service here is also fantastic,  the decor is great, except for the fake grass on the patio which is tacky.  Overall, it is pricey, but a wonderful establishment in Toronto, I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great music, great local beer selection and best of all--FRIED PICKLES."}
{"text":"Had the Smokey Stout Burger. Absolutely delicious. Meat was great quality. Only disappointment - being charged a dollar when I asked for mustard. Am I being nickled and dimed? Or punished for liking a little mustard on my burger?"}
{"text":"Best Pub in Toronto. Great craft beer selection. Amazing food with a real chef (not your typical short-order cook pub food). Owner (Erin) is incredibly friendly and Collin, their Beer 'Sommelier' knows his craft like no other."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very solid pub.  The lower front area feels like you could be chilling at someone's house with the couches and fireplace. I've been here a couple times now and the service has always been quick and pleasant.

They have a respectable beer selection, and decent pub food. It's standard bar fare, but if a place like this doesn't screw up the chicken wings, I am a happy camper!

The highlight of this bar is the Trivia night on Tuesdays.  It's a really laid back and fun style with varying level of difficulty that gets everyone involved.  Every table is passed a booklet and a pen to write the answers to the questions given by the MC.  At the end of the night, each table exchanges their booklets with others and the answers are corrected. Once tallied the winners get fun prizes and gift certificates."}
{"text":"A busy pub with a great Beer list. The fact you can order 4 sample beers at one time is very cool. The only downer is a lot of the beers were sold out or unavailable (perhaps seasonal?)....and they have boardgames!!!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I had went for a celebratory dinner at Zakkushi; it was still early so we decided to look around for a place to enjoy a pint. We decided on Stout Irish Pub. From the exterior, this place looks like an average Irish pub. I wasn't expecting much; however, as we walked in and went to the patio ... wow! It was so cute and cozy; the astro-turf was a good touch. I love the ambiance of the outdoor patio. Their drink menu is also quite extensive; it was actually overwhelming because there was so much to choose from. 

Good for: patio, drinks"}
{"text":"Went here with a few of my friends on a week night, it was pretty dead but I had some sort of jalapeno sandwich with a red pepper soup, which was delicious! Great ambiance and friendly service, the server was very knowledgeable with the menu and helped me pick out that oh so perfect sandwich. They also have sundaes, an extensive drink menu, and board games. Definitely give this place a try. If I'm in the area again I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good place to grab a drink and relax with friends/family. Can get quite loud. Good drink selection and food selection. I recommend this pub for anyone looking for a good hangout spot, there are even board games at the front for you to play with."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The beer was a nice local selection and the waitstaff was friendly. The atmosphere was sort of like your typical Irish pub. I would go back to this place, but I wouldn't call it my favourite."}
{"text":"After a few more goes of Stout, I'll upgrade to a 4th star.
The beer prices are steep (around $8-9 a pint after tax before tip) but the selection is good, and the food has been more consistent since my first visit.

The place has also been an interesting place to visit during St Patricks Day, Octoberfest, and the back yard beer festival things they have during summer. The rest of my original post still applies though."}
{"text":"I would love to come back here! I spent an afternoon on their little patio, which sort of feels like you are hanging out in someone's back yard :). Someone's tidy and taken care of backyard, with fresh fake turf and little picnic tables. 

Service was friendly and inviting. They have a great selection on tap! My friends had beer, I stuck to a hot chocolate, as I was nursing a bit of a hangover.

I just liked the atmosphere. We spent a few hours there, laughing and playing jenga. They have a fun selection of board games.

I would go back on a warm day for that lil patio. The inside of the pub also looked good, a little darkly lit when I was there, hence heading toward the patio. But they have big windows toward the front, so I imagine its well lit inside depending on the time of day.

I've passed by the pub on a weeknight and noticed they have quiz night!! (note to self must invite friends for quiz night...denise s, are you reading this? ;)"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT pub in Toronto. I wanted to write a review of it after the first time we went, but never quite got around to it. Now I'm glad I didn't, because I can add more in this time after my second go-around.

Stout is named as a tribute to Murphy's Irish, the only Irish stout you'll find on draft here. I like that the place wants to celebrate \"the other\" Irish beer that often takes a backseat to the popular front-runner, but holds its own with a creamy, nutty flavor and full body without a bitter aftertaste. You won't want to mix Murphy's with cider unless you want something that tastes very, very sweet. Just drink it straight.

The craft beer selection here is commendable. There is always a Great Lakes beer on cask and the microbrew selections are a nice combination of American and Canadian. They turn over their kegs rather frequently too - a good thing when it comes to the quality of the taste.

The food? Very, very good. Better than you'd expect for a pub. Fries and Stout burger crisp and juicy, respectively. The bun could've used a little extra work. However, the fish and chips was OUTSTANDING. The beer batter was perfect and the fish meat itself - slimy, almost gelatinous, pretty much perfect in my eyes. Some people may be put off by just how soft and slippery the fish was (did not have a white fish meat texture), but I adored it. It was a large portion and I found myself wanting to finish all the fish because each bite had the ideal texture of crispy to mushy without being oily. 

Stout it a winter bar. There's a fireplace in the front room, many board games for use, a dark cozy feel, and the attitude that it's best to be safe and cozy with a pint and some grub, rather than outside braving the cold. Highly recommend it for a relaxed dinner in Toronto. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's close to my house. The people and atmosphere are great. Love the patio in the summer time. One of my favourite places!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out last week with a group of people.

First impression, this place is great.  I liked that everyone in the place appeared to be normal...it is truly a neighbourhood hang out.  The vibe was very relaxed and casual.  the decor was really nice too, hardwood floors, dim lighting, and a beautiful traditional pub bar...wood and polished brass...loved it.  The pub itself isn't very big, but the seating is comfortable.  We spotted some cozy leather chairs and small round tables at the front on our way out...looked like the perfect place to settle for an evening of beer, nibbles and board games.

I didn't try any of their food, but I plan on returning again next Tuesday night, when they have their  weekly Trivia Night...I can't wait!  If you can't make it there on a Tuesday, no worries, they have a ton of boardgames for you and your friends to enjoy over a few draughts.


They have an extensive beer list and most impressive, the offerings feature local Ontario breweries, with some Quebec brews as well.  I tried the beer taster (4 - 5oz glasses of whichever beers on tap that you wish to try) for $7.95.  I know that 3 Brewers also offers this, but the selection of beers at Stout Irish Pub is way more interesting and varied.  

You can bet I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Pretty spacious bar. Very good fish and chips. Trivia night was fun, even though we got our butts kicked."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner at the Stout Irish Pub. Staff were friendly and attentive, atmosphere was comfortable. I had the Mac and Cheese, and it was great - the side salad was very good too. Allan had salmon, and said it was good too. We also had Apply Strawberry pie for dessert and it was warm and great. And reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I've been to Stout a few times, and a few things keep bringing me back.
The staff have always been friendly and helpful...I tend to be oblivious to Happy Hour specials, and without an on-the-ball server, I would have missed out on some (cheap) AMAZING onion rings. Seriously as good as a certain unnamed fast food chain, and I've never come close to saying that before.

They also have an excellent selection of international/local/micro beers.

I've never sat up in the bar area because the area near the front is so cozy. It's got a nice big fireplace with a pair of big comfy chairs in front. Even if they're taken, there are tables close enough to enjoy the fire. Plus, they have a big shelf full of (mostly old-school) games to play.

I'm always surprised at how many families with little kids are there, but I've never had a problem."}
{"text":"Not for brunch really, food was ok, service was very nice, the waitress was super nice too, beautiful clean and cozy place, I think is really good for night life but I was not impress with their food for brunch. The desserts were awesome and a big portion. Maybe will go back to try at night for a drink."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

Looking for a place to chill after dinner at Kanpai a group of friends and I decided to cross the street and check this place out.  It was busy on a Saturday night - no surprise there, but we managed to get a table. 

The ground floor has a fireplace and a few tables.  The second floor is tables all crammed in to the point of it becomes kinda uncomfortable if you have to get up and try to squish your way through the floor.  I also found that it was pretty hot - like no ventilation kinda hot.  I was sweating by the end of the night.

The late night food menu is tiny but the drinks menu is extensive.  This is definitely a lively place, loud and boisterous.  Don't come here expecting to hear your friends!  This is most likely due to the fact that they offer board games for play so you can imagine how loud things can get.

A fun place to have an evening out where you can bring your A-game one (pun intended)!"}
{"text":"Great service! Lots of tv's in the back and bar to watch a game. The front is more of a lounge and cozy for a more intimate setting. Small cute back patio. Food has never disappointed. I had their Mac & Cheese which is one of the best I've had in the city so far. My hubby had the sheppard's pie (lamb) which he really enjoyed. A friend of ours had their wings with a bucket of fries. Quite tasty, not the best wings and fries but still good. Their selection of microbrewery beers is outstanding! Our waitress was friendly and great! I've been here a few times not and would go back!"}
{"text":"Great to see an establishment this busy on a Tuesday night..  I had a headache and felt like I 'escaped' after about 15 minutes inside.  Different strokes...  maybe better for a group than someone looking for relaxed pub."}
{"text":"I like the vibe on this place. It's not pretentious and the crowd is local. Extensive beer list that can probably rival Bier Mrkt or Allens."}
{"text":"Fantastic joint. Loved the decor...real nice old pub vibe. Downstairs with nice sofas and upstairs with dining tables.

Huge booze list...impressive list of brews. I was excited to see an imperial stout too because I love those.

The menu had many good looking things on it....my mom grabbed the fish n chips...my gf the special....and me I had to go for something called the Deadly Double Cheeseburger (or something along those lines)....two half pound pattys...nice pieces of toasted country bread loaves and copious chedder...tasted like two phenomenal hamburgers sandwiched between a couple really good grilled cheese sandwiches. for twenty bones it was a great deal. Everybody's portion sizes were ample and the food was really well prepared

would go again...and again...and again..."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, so decided to go here with my boyfriend, brother and sister-in-law as it was close to our houses.  When I walked in, I was intrigued by the board games they had in the front area and made a mental note to come back to play games some time.

We were seated in the back and had a look at the menu.  There were some nice hearty dishes on there, and the waiter told us about some tasty specials (including a prime rib meal for only $20).  They had quite a large beer selection as well.  The problem with the food and beer menu was that they didn't have a number of things on the menu.  It wasn't just that they ran out for the night, they no longer served some of the items.  If there's a number of items that you don't have on the menu anymore, to me that's a sign to print new menus.  Further, my sister-in-law wanted to try one of the specials, but when she ordered we were told that they didn't have any left.  We went to dinner between 6 and 7pm, so prime dinner time.  We were surprised that they would already have run out of one of their specials.

We started off with the nachos to share.  It wasn't as large as the nachos you would see at some bars, but it was exactly what we needed.  They tasted great, especially with the corriander in the pico de gallo (my fave).  

When the mains came I was pleased with how big the portions were.  There definitely wasn't a shortage of food.  I had the chicken pot pie.  The pastry was nice and flakey, the the chicken and vegetables inside were in a tasty sauce.  My biggest qualm, however, was that it wasn't hot enough for me.  It was warm when I first started, but by the time I neared the end, it was cold.  I like my food coming out very hot, so that it's still warm when I'm finishing up.  The prime rib dinner that my brother had looked really good, and I would probably get that next time.  I had my eye on the yorkshire pudding.

It was my boyfriend's birthday that weekend so I asked the waiter to bring out a special dessert for him.  I was able to choose whatever dessert I wanted to put a candle in, which was nice.  They had a berry crumble special, which is what he wanted, so I was happy when they still had some left.  The waiter told me that they had run out of one of the other desserts.  

Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Stout and would go back again.  While I think they need to update their menu if they have things that are permanently off of the menu the food was good and reasonably priced.  Hopefully next time it'll be a bit hotter."}
{"text":"Pubs in the city are a dime a dozen but ones like this are a real gem.

I came for Sunday brunch and was thoroughly surprised by the food. Spot on! Perfectly prepared even the sausage was not your typical pork sausage. Which means these fine folks know those ones are shit. 

I was so excited that I ate it before I realized I hadn't taken a photo ! 

It's still pub food but well made pub food.

Service was great. Atmosphere was comfortable and friendly.

They even have board games . I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. There is not much more to say. I come here regularly and it is the perfect local hang out. Great food, huge portions, great service. 

Got love for Stout!"}
{"text":"If you want some comfort food and enjoy some friendly trivia competition, you have to visit Stout. The food is made for sharing, so order some dishes and share with your friends!

FOOD
Mad Mac $13 (Recommended) - Cheesy goodness on a plate and house-made ketchup? You can't go wrong with this comfort food dish. They prepare this dish with 3 different types of cheeses (Asiago, cheddar, smoked cheddar) and a creamy béchamel sauce. The smokiness of the cheddar really comes through in this dish. However, the star of the dish is the ketchup! It paired so well with the mac and cheese. I don't think I can go back to eating ketchup from a bottle. All restaurants need to make their own ketchup. 

Classic Perogies $10 (Recommended) - Another simple dish, it was great for sharing with friends. The perogies are bit sized pieces. It paired well with the bacon and caramelized onions, but I wish they served it with some salsa to balance off the creaminess of the sour cream and cheese/potato. 

SERVICE
Quick service - the food came 10 minutes after ordering. The server was attentive and made sure that our water was filled and came back to check up on us throughout the lunch service. 

ATMOSPHERE
Trivia nights (Monday/Tuesday @7:30pm) - it gets busy quickly, be sure to get seats, drinks, and food before Trivia starts @6:30pm. Lovely decor and comfortable lounge chairs. Windows/patios are opened when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"My friends have been telling me to come to Trivia Night for a while, and I finally had the privilege of attending the night with my friends on a Monday night. Apparently, they also have it on Tuesday night, but Monday worked better for me as I am usually working in the evenings. 

The atmosphere of the place is very quaint, and just enough noise where it's not too quiet or loud at the same time. We were able to have a decent conversations within our table and the service was great. I was running late with meeting a bunch of my friends for Trivia which started right at 7:30pm, and they were able to guide me directly to the table where my friends were seated and offered me a glass of water and menu to look at. Unfortunately, I was pretty full from a previous meal so I had a bucket of fries and shared it amongst my friends. It was only $5 for a bucket of fries or kettle chips. There was also a free Frisbee which came in the package for checking in on Yelp which I was completely unaware of. It was a nice surprise to have considering we did not score high at all during Trivia night! (Yes, we were probably ranked somewhere at the bottom but shhh) Maybe it's just my group of friends but those questions were tricky! 

Perhaps follow @headscratchersTO for hints to the trivia questions? 

It was a lot of fun, and I would not mind going again. I only wish they had it on other nights other than Mondays or Tuesdays.

As i was leaving the place, I noticed there was a stack of boardgames by the door so for those who love boardgames, perhaps you can give them a try? :)

For those driving there's a green p parking nearby!"}
{"text":"The Stout gets points for not being a chain like all the other fake Irish/English pubs dotting Toronto.   It used to be a favorite haunt of mine eating there at least monthly, unfortunately the quality has noticeably slipped over the last year.

The FOOD: They previously had an awesome burger.  They were one of the very few establishments in Toronto that would cook a burger to order.  Unfortunately, they no longer will cook a burger to anything less than medium rare.  It also appears they've stopped grinding their meat in house.  The tasty chipotle aioli with the fries is still good (although costs extra).  

The other dishes are a bit hit and miss.  The lamb burger is quite tasty, but at $17 is way too expensive for what it is.  The shepherd's pie, which may not quite be very traditional, is still quite tasty.  On my last visit, I had the Grilled Pizza ($15) which was quite a miss.  The acidity of the tomatoes overwhelmed the spice of the merguez sausage.  Perhaps a bit more cheese might have rescued it.  My friend had the beef rouladen ($17) which was rather unremarkable and completely overwhelmed by the allspice or nutmeg seasoning.  The spätzle accompanying it seemed to be pan-fried, which is rather strange.  

The BEER:  They have mostly Canadian craft beer, with of course a couple Irish and more worldly options.  I would say 3 years ago, they were much more competitive with their craft beer selection.  Unfortunately, in my last couple visits, I've been hard-pressed to find much I wanted to try.  Their regular taps are filled with things like Steamwhistle, Lugtread, and Creemore which are pretty much everywhere.  Sometimes they have some interesting beers in their rotating selection, but the pickings have been slim the last few times.  Prices are a little high--consistently pushing $8 plus tax.  Good bottle list though.

The SERVICE: I have to confess it's been super awkward the last couple times.  For example, when the server noticed I'd eaten about half of my grilled pizza, she asked if I wanted it to go, and I declined.  She looked at me puzzled and asked if there was anything wrong, and I just noted that I wouldn't order it again as the flavor just wasn't quite there.  But it was all very uncomfortable and tentative.  Also, they used to always offer a small sip of a beer to help you make a decision on something you hadn't had before, but the last couple visits that practice seems to be discontinued.

OVERALL, the Stout is still decent, but I've been much less satisfied with the food and beer the last few visits.  It's a good option if you live in the neighborhood, but I would no longer recommend going out of the way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome beers on tap and the back patio is a hidden gem. It's an old school Irish pub, with a modern twist. For sure check it out!"}
{"text":"Being pretty close to my place, hungry and in search of a quick pint or two, we descended on Stout.  It's a warm and inviting decor with large windows and lacks the loud, kitschiness of your typical pop Irish pub.  They also have a small collection of board games you can borrow.

And the brews - oh my.  Yes, there are plenty of English and Irish brews.  But there is a very impressive selection of local craft brews in bottles and on tap.  There always have at least one cask from Great Lakes.  And they have Murphy's rather than Guinness on tap.  That's a huge plus in my books.

The dinner menu looked amazing as well... from my computer before I realized they were only offering late-night items.  Being a bit dejected, we ordered some perogies, expecting some limp-wristed excuse for food - to our surprise, we got a big bucket of delicious, crispy fried perogies for $8.

So - plenty of craft brew selection, inviting decor, and cheap and tasty food?  We have a winner."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no regrets about anything I've ordered here. It's my favourite neighbourhood pub, they have a good selection of scotch and the atmosphere is great. Plus if you want to spend some time playing board games, they have a good selection of those too!

Hot tip: the chicken fingers are amazing"}
{"text":"Everyone goes here for the huge selection of beer (and maybe convenience of location); I went to hang out with my colleagues and for my usual margarita. Heh. I hear this pub's got good grub for lunch, but since I've never been, I can't verify. 

Few things that made my experience \"Yay! I'm a fan\" 

1. $5 Appetizers during happy hour - we ordered nachos, perogies, deep fried pickles and sweet potato fries - all of which were very good (quality and quantity inclusive)

2. My collegues raved about the beer and the selection... and they are quite the drinkers, so I can assure you it was good

3. I had two reasonably priced Blackfly Margaritas - $6.25 per bottle... and each bottle made for 2 glasses. 

4. My glass came un-rimmed. So I asked the server if he could rim the glasses with salt. And he was very courteous about it... got the salt rim with 2 kinds of salt.  

Why it missed 1 star then? Merely because I got a beer mug for my Margarita. Which was weird because my colleague was drinking pinapple beer from a cocktail glass. I am sure they had more cocktail glasses... 

Anyway, totally going back for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Great music, fun board games and a solid late night menu. Try the medium spice wings with the French fries and aeioli dip."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic atmosphere-air conditioned, nice location, irishy in nature. The wait staff was also attentive and friendly. However, I ordered the vegetarian curry and it was very one-note and not that great. Lots of kale, not as much other stuff. It was a decent portion size though. At least it was healthy! The pub food that friends ordered (burgers, etc) looked much better."}
{"text":"Visited twice now. Beers are pricey but a very large selection to choose from. Appetizers were hit or miss. The deep fried dill pickles are amazing but the bean dip and nachos weren't great. Service is a little slow and I noticed one of my glasses was dirty after I had drank most of my beer. All in all a fun place to come to but mostly because of the board games."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here - the food servings are generous - love the nachos - chicken sandwich is huge and delicious.  really nice atmosphere with comfy chairs and fireplace, great big window to people-watch going by, good tunes, and a huge variety of bevs to choose from/  love it."}
{"text":"Great spot. There's a board game collection, great beer selection, and good food.

The 4 cup beer taster option is perfect for when you're indecisive and death by double cheeseburger (2 half pound ground rib eye patties between two grilled cheeses) should be a right of passage for burger lovers.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Outstanding, food, service and venue! The fries with the chipotle aioli divine, the periodic, the best we ever had, purchased at Hoppy. Hour( their term) 5.00 each and we were too full to order an entree. So, we are going back tomorrow! Served in front of a fire place in club chairs with great beers! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on a lay over a few months ago, I could've swore I wrote a review of this place but apparently it evaded my attention. For that, I apologize. I love my Irish pubs, and being a New Orlenian,  the vibe of my watering holes must be just right. I was pleased to find this place delivered to my comfort.

Quaint little entrance,  nothing like I'm used to seeing in New Orleans so it may not be that big of a deal to you, but i was drawn to it.  I remember ordering a few different brews, mostly because of the gorgeous, very lovely young lady who sat at the bar herself for one in transit to a movie she was going to see. She picked a couple good ones for me :).

But i digress...

I know for sure I ordered a burger with fries and gravy and it was everything I needed for a second wind to take on the last half of my layover. The bartender was an awesome guy, I'm trying to remember his name, i believe it was Norris, yeah I'm pretty sure that's it. If so, you should stop in and say hello, they're good in helping an indecisive mind pick the right choice.

Fair pricing, good food, great, extensive beer selection, awesome staff, I'll be sure to drop by again whenever I find myself in Toronto."}
{"text":"Large beer selection and board games, though got a big loud once they moved us upstairs to a bigger table. Downstairs by the fire was much more cozy, and the music wasn't as pumpin'. If you have a choice on where to sit, I'd say the younger folks go upstairs, and us old fogies go downstairs ;)

We weren't there during Hoppy Hour (Happy Hour), but I love when places have one. Bonus points for that. It's definitely a place I'd be willing to go back to. Probably more of a 3.5 stars. If you are looking for a place to go with friends for a drink I'd say check it out."}
{"text":"Gord and I walked to Cabbagetown and stopped in the Stout Irish Pub for supper.  We like pubs and have never been there before (we rarely go to that area).

We sat in the bar area

The beer menu is quite extensive.  It's great because it's all craft beer ... no big name brands.  Gord love love loves craft beer so was in heaven!

Gord started with The Devil Scotched These Eggs.  I had half an egg and it was okay.  Gord loves Scotch Eggs and thought this was okay (he wouldn't order them again).  Usually the sausage is wrapped around the egg ... with these ones, the eggs were breaded and the sausage was ground into the yolk.

He also ordered Mad Mac with bacon.   He liked it and would order it again.

I ordered roaster wings (with medium sauce) and fries.   They were both delicious and I'd order them again.  There were eight wings to the 1.2lb order.  The wings were huge!

The Stout is a fabulous pub and we had a good time there ... too bad it wasn't closer to home.

Lance was our server.  He was friendly and polite and took good care of us."}
{"text":"A must to check out if you're in the area.  

This is the old Brass Taps that got a new lease on life with Stout.  The owners have brought great vision to the neighborhood and taken something that wasn't working and turned it on it's head.

The food menu is more than just bangers and mash, a far cry from what we usually see at Irish Pubs, and they feature local Ontario Beers on their taps.  A great selection I might add as well.

The service is awesome with the owner remembering my name on my second visit... 

A great place to check out and call your second home..."}
{"text":"A gem of a bar in the city. 

Warm, inviting - it's got a fire place, and old piano, a patio with astro turf that you can smoke on, regular bar type seating along with couches.And a great selection of craft/micro beers.  

The draw to this place is the board games. And best of all, they're free. You don'r pay extra like at Snakes and Lattes. 


The only drawback about Stouts is that they could use a bit of help in the food department. They're almost there though. That's my only complaint. Their burgers are excellent (ground fresh daily) but some of the other dishes are a little too bland/poorly executed. Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"Abundant beer selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff, warm atmosphere, all topped off with pub trivia, a great place.  Very fun times. The only downside was that because it was trivia nigh it was busy and the tables are pretty crowded.Not much room to get up and move around."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars even though there was only ONE server when I got there - 1:30pm on a Monday. But the server let everyone know up front what the situation, which was great, I wasn't in a hurry anyway. He was quick and friendly and super fast with drinks. Food seemed to come out fast too. 

The lunch menu had a great deal of a burger+ beer for $20, a great deal! The beer was great: St Ambroise Maple Ale was fantastic. I followed up with a fun 4 pour 5oz each tasting or \"flight\" which was also excellent. 

The burger was a bit overlooked for my taste (I like more medium than well) but still tasty. The poutine was AWESOME. This was my first try of poutine and I am pretty much a fry addict anyway, but wow. Perfect blend of gravy and cheese. The fries were not oily or clumpy or gross by the end and I loved it. Fantastic. I would definitely go here again. Thanks to Mark for being a great server!"}
{"text":"This place is solid! 

The atmosphere is fantastic with a variety of seating, a fireplace, board games you can play for free, and lots of space. In the evening they lower the lighting and really create a nice intimate mood perfect for drinks with your buddies or a casual date. 

The service was really friendly and chatty, and some of the best I've had in awhile. 

The food is the only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars. There's nothing too wrong with the food. They've clearly tried with their food selection. They've definitely gotten the beer and mixed drinks right. But the food itself is just nothing great or special either. A bit greasy and over fried. They're missing the mark a little. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been back a few times since I wrote my original review and a few adjustments need to be made. For one thing, the opening reference to \"the review above\" is no longer relevant since that \"review\" has been  (quite rightly) removed. Now, on to the important stuff....

I'm happy to say that my impressions of Stout as a pub--a pub, not an eating-place--are definitely improved. I've gotten over my disappointment that the fireplace is not a real wood-burning fireplace but a glassed-off gas one. At least it's warm and pretty to look at. The big comfy leather chairs really are beautiful. The staff are still friendly and super-helpful, and they seem to be becoming more aware of the need to modulate the music so it's not quite so blaringly intrusive. And, last time I was there, I actually did catch a whiff of the burning peat that the Toronto Life reviewer mentioned--not in the fireplace, but smouldering away in a tin can near the door. They seem to have trouble keeping it alight, and it's only been going for one or two of my last three visits--I hope they can figure out a way to make it work, because it really does add to the atmosphere. (For those who don't know, peat is a fuel traditionally used on Irish fires--it's basically a piece of bog dug up, dried, then put on a fire. It smells GORGEOUS--smoky and whisky-like. Mmmmm.) They've also finally got their Sunday afternoon ceilis (trad Irish music sessions) going, and I can't wait to check one of those out, though I suspect they'll be packed out in that tiny downstairs space.

All this has bumped my review up to three stars, although I would have given 2.5 if I could. Mostly because...

Less happily, I have to report that the food remains a) seriously overpriced and b) truly underwhelming. I've tried two more dishes since my last visit, and not only were they all very \"blah\", but they are being charged at the sort of prices I would expect to see in an upscale/midrange restaurant. 

A beef dip sandwich, $14.99, came on a quality Ace Bakery baguette, but the meat was unappetisingly brown, chewy, and flavourless. It felt kind of industrial. The sandwich needed something--onions, mustard, pickles, something--to distract from/attempt to cover this. The accompanying \"jus\" was more like gravy, both gelatinously fatty and also lacking flavour. A Caesar salad was better than the usual pub Caesar, with a nice lemony dressing and plenty of actual, no-foolin' bacon, but let down--as most Caesars are in this town--by plasticky shards of pre-grated generic \"parmesan\". The $20 beef ribs were moist and tender, but the McAuslins' apricot ale sauce was too sweet to be either complex or punchy enough to hold up to the meatiness. It came with a chef's salad, which was fresh, and lightly dressed, but kind of boring.

I know for a fact that tasty, intelligent but traditional, complex but comforting, and beautifully prepared pub food CAN be found in Toronto at great prices. For evidence, look no further than the House on Parliament, just around the corner from Stout, or Dora's on the Danforth, where I recently had delicious wild boar sausage with creamy horseradish mash and a mushroom peppercorn sauce, for $11.20. With such tough competition in the neighbourhood they are going to have to seriously lift their game, and lower their prices. I will definitely be back, though--for awesome beers, Irish music, and comfy chairs. Then round the corner to the HoP for dinner. :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best customer service experiences that I have ever had in Toronto.

My trivia team decided to check out Stout's Tuesday night trivia - but we had no idea how packed it would be. There were no tables or chairs available inside when we arrived (pretty close to the start time). We felt disappointed because we had forgone our regular trivia night to try this one out... The hostess literally moved a promotional event and bribed regulars to shuffle around to make room for our group of SIX (!!). It. Was. Amazing.

The servers were great - it was standing-room-only but they were everywhere, making sure no one was waiting on a drink or a food order; efficient, polite, got our orders PERFECT (even with modifications) and then they split the bills for us! WHO is that accommodating in Toronto? (No one).

The food was fine; the portions are large but it's sort of expensive (chicken wings + fries were almost $16... the fries were really good and the wings weren't bad).  The beer selection is very big and very good, but also expensive ($7.25/$7.50ish and half pints were $5).

Even though it costs a couple bucks more to come here than other places in the area, the service was outstanding and I would be happy to go back. I cannot say enough good things about the experience my friends and I had. Other small business owners take note; this is how to treat customers."}
{"text":"They had an amazing cherry Pommies. I had it with the cherry cheesecake. Yummy! My husband had a flight of Amsterdam, Collective Arts, and 2 Shackland Mezza beers. We have walked by hundreds of times and today we went in. I'm glad we have. Everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"This must be my new favourite Irish pub in Toronto. 

It has a real authentic feel, although it's far nicer than most of the pubs you'll find in Ireland. There are lots of leather lounge chairs in the front room when you enter but once you head up the stairs the decor is more traditional.

They have a HUGE beer list. I love the \"beer samplers\" you can get - 4 x 5oz mini beers for only $7.49. This way you can sample quite a few. 

The service was excellent and the barmaids really know the menu well. 

They even had a cider ON TAP. Thank you. Finally. It's so hard to find cider on tap in Toronto. This was a Canadian cider - BC Rock Cider, but it was delicious, crisp and light.

The pub is quite small (hoorah!) and was packed with a wide variety of non-douchy people (yay). 

I didn't get to try to food, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tons of beers on the menu, which was wonderful. We tried two dark stouts. Was looking to try local beer, and 10W30 was just what I was seeking. Delicious. The other, King dark lager, had a unpleasant after taste. Split onion rings and a beet salad. Topped it off with the homemade apple cheesecake, that had a crust that seemed to be missing butter? The food was moderate, the service was good, and the beer menu was great, so stop in for a drink, and meander on in the neighborhood for food."}
{"text":"Amazing secret back patio that can accommodate groups of four or more. The first pub that has faux grass on their back patio. Am I the only one who loves the feeling of grass on my feet on a hot summers day? Their food is (surprisingly) delicious and beer selection is nice. Service can be a bit slow so be patient, but the food is worth the wait. The location is a bit out of the way though. Pro tip: You can come with your friends and play any one of their numerous board games. Pro tip 2: Skip the seating inside and beeline to the back patio."}
{"text":"I really don't know what to expect! 

My Yelp Friend kept asking are there no Pub along Yonge Street or Church.... Why I am dragging him through the dark streets and alleys all the way to here... to Stout Irish Pub!

I love the cozy atmosphere of Stout, especially with the warm glowing fire place. And those huge armchairs, I can sink it to one of them and let them swallow me...

Extensive Beer Selections with some seasonal choices. I should have got the taster option... maybe next time. 

Big TVs showing The Detroit Game made my friend happy and relax or maybe he was watching the live show perform by those lovebirds close to us... While I drink my beer and daydream...

Services though friendly but was a little slow at time. It took forever to get the bill and then to pay it with my credit card.

I will definitely be back to Stout again when I am in the area. Beer Tasting next time for sure!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger was ABSOLUTE crap. I mean, crappier than I have ever even imagined a veggie burger to be. They really need to fix their vegan options..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a rainy weekend. 

The food was great, big portions and tasty to boot. I'm pretty sure their burgers are at least a 1/2 pound, if not a 1 pound of meat. Though, my perception of tastiness might've been altered due to the time spent waiting for our food (a cheeseburger and a BLT wrap). Owing to the rain, the place was pretty quiet.

I think I was ravenous when we finally got our plates.

The service was top notch but the brews, pricey.

All-in-all, a decent place if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. It's been decent but the prices are high for what you get. Particularly the nachos... for $20 (yes... $20 nachos if you get chicken added), I expect amazing. Which they used to be. Instead, this visit we got minimal cheese, the *smallest* side of sour cream possible, crusty and burnt refried beans along the bottom. I'm giving three stars because other visits have been better. But the last visit, food quality and portions were poor and the inattentive service was bad, too. (Should I have to go to the bar to get my own water? Isn't that the server's job?) I would go back once more in case it was a bad day / kitchen was off but this was memorably bad, enough to warrant a review."}
{"text":"We had our last experience here recently.  I've noted that the food was to be missed but we got together and I didn't have a chance to eat before arriving.  I decided to be a bit brave and order the gnocchi and regretted it immediately on trying it.  It wasn't eatable.  I had two other people try it and they agreed.  I had never sent anything back before in my life. That isn't hyperbole, I haven't.  Usually I just suck it up but I was starving and massively disappointed.  The waitress was really good about it and disappeared with the dish and a new order (a much safer fish and chips).  After about 5 minutes a woman came and asked gruffly what was wrong with the dish.  I explained that it wasn't eatable and apologized but I was hungry and didn't want to eat it.  She pressed the point - asked what specifically was wrong with it.  I said it lacked flavour and was too mushy (I was being polite, it had the consistency of gummy glue).  She, is a profoundly condescending tone, explained that this is what gnocci is and that maybe if I had tried it before I would have known what I ordered. I thanked her and left it at that.  I can say, having had gnocci on numerous occasions, that this was the not only the worst gnocci I have ever had but the worst pasta.  We were more than 20 people at the table.  I was the only one to send anything back.  We had been there countless times.  I'll never be back.  I can over look the food and stick to drinks but not the experience.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stumbled past this place one Saturday afternoon decided to yelp it... It got good reviews! We went inside and I really liked the decor -- and a piano! I tinkled on the ivories a bit and moved on. 

It was still at their brunch menu and I think I had the classic breakfast. It was good! The Sausages WERE AMAZING. Those are probably the best pub sausages I've had -- and I've had my fair share.  

The reason I only gave 3 stars is that there were only 2 tables seated at this time and the waitress was really slow and ignoring us most of the time. Also, the beer is extremely expensive, more expensive than any other place around there -- for the same beer!!! Creemore should NOT be that expensive."}
