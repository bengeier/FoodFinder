{"text":"Staying in the hotel (Marriott Platinum). Just got the usual grilled chicken sandwich and hummus, after arriving... I got a chicken nugget..."}
{"text":"This is the normal Marriott fare. Always good, but not over the top. Tonight we had the salmon and a cheeseburger. The food was excellent and the service was very attentive. You can't go wrong at a Marriott, just s little pricey."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the JW Marriott by the airport. There are quite a few variety of choices for you to pick from for dinner. The place is a bit pricey, after all, it is in a JW Marriott. The reason I had to give them 3 stars is because of numerous things. We ordered bread. They delivered the bread halfway through our entree. I got the chicken fajitas and my husband got the chipotle chicken wrap. My fajitas were OK. I'm not sure if they matched the price OK, but I do know I pay for the location. My husband wasn't quite as pleased with his wrap. He felt it could use more flavor. I gave him some of my food. I was hoping for more of a Mexican flavor. Lesson learned. The server was very attentive."}
{"text":"After reading the mixed reviews on this restaurant I'm compelled to share my experience. For an airport hotel restaurant, I don't think it could possibly have been better. The front of house staff were friendly and welcoming. The wait staff (Lee and Jessica were outstanding) couldn't have been kinder or more attentive. As a single business traveller with some dietary restrictions, Lee proposed some substitutions to a dish that I wanted. I wasn't anticipating such genuine care and concern for an airport hotel. Jessica remembered after breakfast on day 1 that I would ask for a to-go coffee cup, and simply brought one to my table in advance. I don't recall ever having experienced such consistent attention to detail. And now I must reevaluate my expectations. I will definitely stay here on future trips to Phoenix. Oh, and the food was excellent too!!!"}
