{"text":"Fan Boy Fries are the best :] i love them"}
{"text":"After my first review, a good amount of changes were made. They really took the time to listen to students and change their menu accordingly. The option to build your own bowl is great since I can now pair my favorite beef&onion and TKO sauce together. The lettuce wraps are also fantastic so make sure to get an order of those as well! You can't find food this good anywhere else on campus."}
{"text":"Cheap and good food! They need to come to ASU more often."}
{"text":"Oh my I spotted this bad boy at the Tempe Campus right in between of the Apache Parking Structure and the BAC Business Building!! 
After seeing this truck parked there around 5:00pm till about 7:00pm I decided to pay them a visit and see what they had to offer. Boy was I glad I did, since they offered much healthier meal options then the MU does! Makes me and my tummy very happy. 
They have delicious and quickly prepared bowls or sides! Top notch ingredients and flavors. For example, I went with their B.Y.O.B. (Build your own bowl) and selected the marinated stir-fry chicken, along with stir-fry veggies, white rice, spicy teriyaki sauce and a bit of their ninja dust, which was recommended for an added spicy kick. Oh my, it was OH SO GOOD and healthy too!! So I was glad I decided to try them out! 
The service was super sweet and friendly! Great experience!! High five to that and a well deserved A++ 
I will be paying them more visits I'm sure!! :)"}
{"text":"Since my initial review, Fan Boy has really improved their game. Menu items that didn't cut it were removed (i.e. the tacos). Things still aren't perfect (service issues like seemingly regular failures of the credit card system with no possibility of payment by cash, uneven rice quality, food served lukewarm), but the improvement is definitely significant. Hopefully Fan Boy will continue to work to improve their product and service."}
{"text":"This truck is delicious and adorable. Tried the Fan Boy fries (criss cross fries and marinated beef) and the bacon-wrapped hot dog. Sooo good. Sooo full."}
{"text":"Orange chicken and lettuce wrap are really good! Try them, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Such yummy food and an adorable truck! :D Just make sure you have M&G or a credit card to order b/c they don't accept cash. Get the fries!! That was my first meal and I loved it :D"}
