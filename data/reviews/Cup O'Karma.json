{"text":"Went out of our way to find this place since we were close to the hospital, only to find it was closed. Got there at 7:56pm on a Monday. Yelp says it closes at 9pm"}
{"text":"We ran into this place by accident and decided to treat ourselves to a sweet treat after dinner. The shop was very clean and had a really nice, relaxing atmosphere. We were greeted by Madison (I hope I remembered her name correctly!) and made to feel welcomed. We asked about a couple drinks and ended up learning that they're actually a non-profit who help women and their children who've suffered from domestic abuse. I think this is an amazing place and a much needed place! Our drinks were delish and the price was way less than expected! We were invited to come back for one of their many nightly events. This place is a little out of the way for us but it's well worth the drive knowing what their mission is."}
{"text":"Wifi didn't work for me -- not sure if it was me or the wifi, though. The barista was friendly and tried to help, but we couldn't figure out what was wrong. Though I'd love to give them another try, the risk of wifi not working when I need it to get work done has deterred me from coming back =/"}
{"text":"I love Central Phoenix. love Love LOVE. Unfortunately I am living in Chandler right now and it doesn't look like the coffee shops of the East Valley compare to those found in Central Phoenix. All you find are chains and the few privately owned shops still lack that urban vibe. I'll admit Cartel Coffee Lab comes close but the people who work there are too snobby for their own good. You work in Tempe people not Scottsdale! After getting sick of driving to Phoenix for a decent cup o' Joe I tried out Cup O'Karma.   When I visited it was surprisingly empty even with MCC being right across the street. Is school in session there? Who knows, but I was able to have the whole spot to myself. The reason this place gets 5 stars is not because of its comfortable couches or quirky art on the contemporary walls but because it is non profit. Cup O'Karma was donated by its previous owner for $1 and it is now a NATN community project.   Coffee shop with a cause? I'm in!  If you're in the east valley and are thirsty to support social change stop by and see the folks at Cup O'Karma."}
{"text":"Friendly vibe and comfortable coaches. I had a tangerine or something iced tea that was delicious and thirst-busting. The staff was friendly and open. I went for the comedy open mic and had a lot of fun. There were some music open mic participants as well. Seems like a good place to go to either be alone or chat people up."}
{"text":"I like coming here to get work done. I do wish there were even one or two more food options, because I want to support the mission, I have lots of work I can do in a coffee shop...but also I get hungry. Be nice if I could switch it up a little more. Anyway, it's comfy, chill, and the bathroom is neat and clean. Overall nice vibe."}
{"text":"It is a non for profit place. Decent coffee/latte selections. I only ordered tea. There is live music most nights, but it is such a small space... kind of uncomfortable. I'd rather go to starbucks(and I hate starbucks)."}
{"text":"Tiny little place with great ambiance. I love the fact it is staffed by volunteers and all proceeds go to Seeds of Hope. Good coffee. If they had a few more available munchies they would be all set."}
{"text":"Everyone is Friendly and the Atmosphere is Grounding. Quaint and they have bands playing at 7PM during the week."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place with good coffee and friendly employees.  What I like best is that the music is kept at a low enough volume to relax, unlike so many other noisy places.  Spotless restroom, easy parking.  Good cause."}
{"text":"Love the cause. Love the coffee, employees and open mics. Very cool little spot to relax and read a book."}
{"text":"Cute little place, nice people, good coffee, and they're committed to a couple of social causes which is great.  And good, free wi-fi.  :-)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good coffee and iced tea, and a great selection of hot teas, along with a cool ambiance and a welcoming environment--what more could you want? I haven't had a chance to try their pastries, but they look very good, and they have a nice variety of instant oatmeals. Try their tropical iced tea and their spicy cinnamon black tea. Both are excellent."}
{"text":"The Cup O' Karma is such a neat coffee shop, it has a lot of character and flair and a great iced coffee."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. I was initially skeptical of this place. The only signage was \"coffee\" and it was tucked in a small shopping center. I had expected a hipster coffee shop and gotten a sort of kitschy community coffee shop. We stopped in for a quick coffee (which was delicious!) and it turned out to be open mic night. We wound up staying for a couple of hours listening to the folky lineup. The music and coffee were way above our expectations. And the best part is that a portion of the profits go to benefit domestic violence education. This place was a surprising all around win, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great Chai!  Super friendly barista!  Cute shop!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really good and refreshing iced tea! I stopped by to run in and grab some liquid because I was really feeling dehydrated and had a fantastic tropical iced tea! It was exactly what I needed and was craving. Such a great place! I look forward to trying the coffee:)"}
{"text":"Cool location 8/10 points drinks 4/10 employee treatment 1/10 treat your employee better. I identify with employees who are not treated well in front of customers"}
{"text":"Was there Saturday Night to listen to a friend play his Music. I have been there a few times. The staff is always friendly and they serve a great cup of coffee. I drank the Latte and was warned that the four I had could cause me to lose sleep well they were right I did but I will be back to enjoy at least one more or four."}
{"text":"This amazing venue is such a valuable community asset!   This charity-run cozy room serves as the public end of an effective mode of transition for victims of domestic violence. While serving teas, coffees, Latte's & desserts, this Cup O Karma - NATN organization provides housing, counseling, and job training for victims of domestic violence.   This is such a needed remedial option for victims (mostly women and their children) to have a safe place to go, get educated about the causes & solutions to domestic violence, & acquire on the job training for marketable skills.   Many people associated w/ Cup O Karma are survivors of domestic violence. I am personally a survivor.  I was in an abusive marriage in the early 1980s & there was NO program available in that community (SLO, CA) at that time. It took some severe incidences to cause me to earnestly seek getting out - which is very difficult to do w/o help.    Domestic violence is passed on from parents (who were often abused as youngsters) to their children or young relatives  - it's a cyclic psychological situation. Abused people contribute to their children becoming abused --- because the children grow up seeing abuse as a normal behavior in their environs - and are conditioned to become further players in this dirty game.  If you know of anyone who you think may be a victim of domestic violence, please get them in touch with us.... Please see the website at   http://www.natn-az.org/cup-okarma/  \"Like\" & \"Follow\" our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/CupOKarma/  I have been hosting & providing musical entertainment in the form of Open Mic- Jam - Poetry Slam at the Mesa coffee shop every month for 3 and 1/2 years. I have met many wonderful people, and been of encouragement to many women in the program, various performers, poets, & musicians, too!   Now that the Mesa coffee shop is closing (due to high overhead), we seek a new location. We are hopeful for a Tempe location - w' collaboration from the Tempe Government.   In the time being, we have a new monthly gifting program - just $5 or more a month - to go toward opening our Tempe shop.  We have a nice smaller service area located inside the Chandler Public Library. 22 S Delaware St. Chandler, AZ 85225 (480) 782-2770  See the Youtube about Cup O Karma- now in Chandler. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2kgJuF_6lY#t=45 Spread the word.

{"text":"Good. Nice people. User friendly. Had A lunch meeting there.  Staff was good to us. Nice and clean. Easy parking. Easy in and out."}
{"text":"The Americano was one of the best I've had. Not too harsh but such bold flavor! This is a non profit coffee house that supports the end of violence with women. Will absolutely be frequenting this coffee shop!"}
{"text":"This is a cafe with a cause. All the proceeds go to support the National Advocacy & Training Network. You can find out more about this organization here: www.nant-az.org/seeds/. Throw in a caring atmosphere, free Wi-Fi, comfy chairs and sofas, and some tasty tea, and I'm good to get my work done. Hopefully, they'll have t-shirts soon!"}
{"text":"A delightful enough experience at a delightful enough location. It's kind of out of the way, but it's got a good cause, so I don't mind.   Cup O'Karma is a simple little coffee shop just off of Southern near Target, west of Longmore. It's tucked back in a quiet little strip mall and it pretty unassuming--the sign on the building simply says \"Coffee Shop.\"  Inside, there are a few tables of various sizes, and a couple of boards with their offerings. As a non-coffee drinker, I'm more interested in fruity drinks that seem to be ubiquitous in these parts at this time of the year. I don't do tea, so it was decided that a caramel vanilla shake was in order.  Hand scooped ice cream (big plus) and a swirl of caramel and I was on my way. The big draw here was really the free wifi. It wasn't blazing fast, but didn't frustrate me either. Middle of the road; ask the barista for the username and password.  The restroom was tidy, and the place was pretty quiet. The gal behind the counter was new, and was being trained by the boss who was there walking her through the ropes. She runs a tight ship here--everything has a very specific procedure, and I was happy to see that cleaning and menu precision is high on the list.  They do entertainment throughout the month--music, open mic, poetry, etc. There's a stage that tucks away, and I had to leave before open mic night started.  As for the cause, a portion of your purchase goes towards helping people recover from domestic abuse. I don't know much more about it, but there are pics under the glass in the table and more information there about how to help out. I figure if you can sip your shake and help out your fellow human, you're probably doing something right."}
{"text":"I'm a coffee snob...and I needed wifi. Wifi is a sure thing, and quality of wifi isn't that important. However a GREAT cup of coffee is critical!   COK handled both. Cool vibe, friendly barista, terrific cup of their locally roasted brew, and the wifi seemed as good as any :)  I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a great place and a great cause.  I went there last night for Comedy Open Mic.  The comedians were running there new stuff by us and it was great.   My wife had a Iced Green Tea and I had the Pacific Northwest smoothie which was out of this world good and reminded me of Oregon.  This place would rock in Oregon.   All of the money goes to help support NATN: http://www.natn-az.com/home/cup_o_karma  Copied from their Homepage: Cup O' Karma: Community Cafe for a Cause, a project of NATN, provides job-training opportunities for women participating in our SEEDs programs. NATN is a nonprofit agency committed to addressing the health, safety, economic and social justice issues related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and substance abuse through education, public awareness, and direct services. All proceeds generated through Cup O' Karma are used to advance the mission of NATN.  Please check this place out and support their cause."}
{"text":"I am glad to be the first to re-introduce this location to the Yelp community!  A friend and I ventured in, with only a little bit of time before a physiology exam at MCC, across the street. We were avoiding Starbuck's at any cost, and the cost turned out to be showing up for our exam about 5 minutes late! The story about Cup O' Karma was more interesting than an test on kidney function. What can I say?  Into The Bean was sold for $1 to a non-profit organization benefiting Seeds of Hope. Seeds of Hope is a domestic abuse and sexual assault assistance agency, seeking to provide information and advocacy for survivors. Volunteers work the counter, and all proceeds benefit Seeds. You can find literature on the counter and in the bathroom.  The place has been redecorated and is very welcoming and warm. The women working there are friendly and caring. Since Cup O' Karma is still pretty new, some bugs are still being worked out; register issues, how much syrup to put in the coffee drinks... etc.  I have had two iced vanilla lattes and one iced chai (soy). Both were delicious. I loved studying here- it was quiet and not corporate. They even have a few breakfast items- bagels one morning and croissants another. Some of the drinks have crazy names, although I don't remember them offhand right now. One was some kind of Chernobyl berry thing!  Stop by!  Its a little expensive, but worth the cause."}
{"text":"At 8:40 am after dropping the hubby off at MCC for class across the street, I was just looking for a place to chill for an hour.  I saw the big \"COFFEE\" sign from Southern and thought Eureka!  Uh, they were closed. The door and windows outside display a lot but not their hours of business and Yelp claims that this place opens at 7am (as they should, if not earlier with it being a coffee establishment).   Waiting outside confused, another customer approaches the door and I decided to ask him if he had been here before. He hadn't, and we noticed people inside. I knocked and waved an employee over who told us that they don't open until 9am. Well, my fellow coffee consumer left for Starbucks and I nearly went with him. I only stayed because I wanted to write this review.   Coffee isn't that great anyway, but that's the only thing I purchased. They won't serve it to you by French press either.   One last thing: the gal who served me was polite but uninformed. She didn't know how much a coffee refill was and had to ask the older gal working. (Refills are 1/2 the $ of your drink, btw...) The older lady decided to pour my coffee while the other took my payment but interrupted her twice asking how I take my coffee. She could have just looked at me and asked, instead of insisting that she tell her that I take it just black. Lady left plenty of room for cream regardless.   Karma's a B sometimes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Warm & inviting. The staff who are volunteers are the sweetest people, very welcoming. The coffee is Yummy! I love hot mocha's and they use Ghiradelli chocolate!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, clean environment, good service & laid back atmosphere.    The best thing about this place is the cause, this is a non-profit coffee house that helps women & families recover from domestic violent abusive past relationships.  They do this by helping women gain their independence to live a life free from violence.    If you're searching for a local coffee house,  stop in & drink coffee for a cause."}
{"text":"I like to come in here when I want a nice comfortable place to study and good caffeine! They are located right across the street from MCC so it can't get any more convenient.  The people who work here are super friendly and it's usually very quiet so I can sprawl out with all of my books and laptop. I was soooooo impressed that they donate the proceeds to such an excellent cause!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I go pretty much every Wednesday to listen to Paul Knight play/sing. Great atmosphere, great people, love the chai and mocco (sp?) cocoa latte (both hot and cold), and of course love the fact that it's all for a good cause. They also sale crafts and other things to help raise money for NATN.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely a good cause. Coffee and service can be a hit or miss depending on the person behind the counter. The mochalicious is amazing. Certain  nights they have live entertainment which can be a really fun experience with friends. Wifi sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, but there are interesting magazines and a couple books to look at so if you're killing time before class or work you won't be bored."}
{"text":"I upped the star here because the place is a not for profit.    My mocha was not great, barely good.  But I'm sure i will be able to find something i like.  What i do like is the atmosphere.  Great people and a good place to hang.  Very friendly and open.  Comfortable seating and vibe.  I'd give it a try."}
{"text":"ok, so for some reason, my usual wifi spot/coffee shop was not open last night, or this morning.  weird. so, I was forced to take matters into my own hands, and find a new place to plug my computer in and drink coffee until my 'usual' spot decides when to reopen.  so, I thought I had seen this place from the road.  Its on Southern, in a strip mall, tucked away.  This place is a cute little treasure!  Its well decorated.  Has an artsy feel to it.  Has artists paintings for sale on the wall, with some really cool couches to sit on and get your drink on.  Theres also stainless steel tables in here as well, which I love!  kind of a modern chic feel.  Comfortable classy atmosphere without the stuffiness!  Clean, eclectic, without being dirty or drab.    They have all your usual coffee shop drinks with a decent range in prices and sizes.  THey have ice cream shakes, italian sodas, organic coffees and some teas as well for good measure.  The location itself is not large.  Rather small, but well done with ample seating and space.  They also have a few outdoor tables and chairs as well!  They have 'free' wifi, but only after you make a purchase.  I went with a choclate muffin, since I'm a little overcaffinated at the moment.  I was given the password and login info after I paid for my muffin.  Now, here is where they loose a star.  First, I had trouble logging onto thier network.  It wouldnt even show up on my wireless connection screen.  I asked the lady behind the counter, and she was mildly helpful, but she really didnt know what to do.  Mind you, I am primarily here to get on the internet, okay?  So she tells me that sometimes the connection here is weird, and said that sometimes the signal here is bad, and to move tables and try the 'otherside of the shop.'  Ive never heard of one side of a business getting wifi, and the other not.  So, I switch sides of the (already small) shop.  For some retarded reason, it worked.  weird.  now I am on the internet typing this review.  Also, as a side note, they lost a few points for another reason, and i will explain.  Normally, I dont usually pick up/evesdrop on others conversation while out.  Honestly, I really could care less, and unless its a screaming match, Im probably not listening.  When I walked in, these ladies were gossiping about something. Someone borrowed $10, and this one lady was pissed off about it becuase her friend that had borrowed the $10 hadnt paid her back.  These two women are discussing it, and honestly, I just thought it was such a personal conversation to be having in the middle of a coffee shop while your working.    Anyways, I really do like this place, despite the weird wifi connection, and most likely will be returning.  This place supports the training of Domestic Violence victims...Please go here and get coffee, as your money goes to a good cause."}
{"text":"Went here for a Phoenix Friday Coffee night. Met Sunny, MsHerr, Austin, others I can't remember because I'm getting old.  Coffee wasn't too bad. Seating was nice. Prices were ok.  I'd go back if I didn't live so far away. They seem to be very active in supporting feminist issues, which I'm good with."}
{"text":"Well Amy B's FTR pretty much covered all the bases.  Ditto on pretty much the whole thing including the chatty employees.  I had a nice iced green tea and no problems using the wifi.  Where to go with my review now?  The bathroom at Into the Bean is a unisex bathroom.  It was very clean.  The soap was not overly fragranced as some bathroom soaps are.  It also did not have one of those industrial fragrance dispensers.  I hate those.  I always seem to be in the bathroom when those effing things crank out their metered doses of toxic fumes.  The wall with the sink and toilet had an interesting finish.  It had a very dark grey to black wash and over this colorful squares had been stamped in a pattern.  The squares were in bright colors and the paints used for the stampings were metallic looking.  It was interesting.    OK, I think that pretty much covers it.  The next Yelper to review this place might want to check out the dumpster out back."}
{"text":"A cozy atmosphere where I was comfortable to hangout with my son. The beverages were competitively priced and generously sized. The employees were friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"We went to see a comedy show, but we loved the place.  It has a great emphasis, helping those who have been affected by abuse.  And the service and offerings are outstanding.  I tried my hubby's smoothie...MmmMmmmm.  My green tea was great, and they have sugar in the raw, which I prefer!   A great place to see comedy or hear poetry and relax on an inexpensive date while helping others!  Win-win-WIN!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night.  There were a couple of musical acts playing and a very good vibe in the place.  Quite busy, with many types of people (as diverse as Mesa gets, anyway).  Friendly service, too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to be the first to really criticize this place....but it really was not good at all. I understand that it is a non profit place and it's there to help people, and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The BF and I went here this morning to get our coffee fix and to try it for the coffee tour of phoenix! It was a huge disappointment. I ordered an iced latte and he ordered a hot latte. The hot latte had no foam. Both lattes had a very strange flavor. We had both asked for 2% milk, but it tasted like she used half and half? or a milk substitute? It had a weird 'fake' quality about it. Further, the coffee was just about nonexistent. It was like when I was a kid and my mom would put a teaspoon of coffee in my milk because I liked the flavor.... not what I'm looking for at a coffee place and not what we paid 4$ a drink for. We both ended up throwing away over half of our drinks because they were so bad. The place has a cute look, but I will never be back. Ugh.     PS It may be immature but I think it's funny that they have signs all around with their shortened name 'cok' heh. heh."}
