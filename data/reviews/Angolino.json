{"text":"Amazing food...amazing service...delicious wines! Make sure you call ahead because they can get busy! The waiter said the Brussel Sprouts were life changing and he didn't lie...my new absolute favourite!!!"}
{"text":"Went for NYE our 1st time. Read about them in BlogTO and wanted to celebrate locally in The Junction. We had a wonderful, romantic time. Delicious amuse-bouches, appetizer, main & dessert. We each ordered different things & everything was beautifully presented, perfect temperature out of the kitchen, and served in a friendly & unobtrusive way. Cocktails were yummy too. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My partner and I were looking for a quiet place with a nice atmosphere to have a casual but intimate date night, and we found what we were looking for in Angolino (The Junction) I'm vegetarian, so I appreciated the amazing veggie options available. We had an assortment of appetizers, but I loved the forest mushroom arancini (stuffed rice balls).  He had the wild boar meatballs which apparently were delicious, as well.  We're usually wine people and this would be a great spot to enjoy a glass but we were feeling beer. We tried Duggans #9 for the first time (owner`s suggestion), which was a great choice.   The service was super friendly, fast and personable. Very relaxing and enjoyable evening.  Thanks, Angolino! We`ll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this restaurant is in my neighbourhood -- it's perfect place for a really nice, comforting, well-executed Italian dinner out, and really great value. Our server was a sweetheart.   I got the cavatelli and it was perfectly cooked and super tasty. My husband is a vegetarian and got the agnolotti, which was also delicious. The brussels sprouts side was hard to stop eating. The rapini was not as interesting but still tasty. Their focaccia was unbelievably soft. All the portions were really substantial. The biggest downside is that the wine list is very so-so. Overall we had a great dinner and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing personalised hospitality. Great food. Had the gnocchi, Brussel sprouts, arancini, and a full other things. Loved it all! Real cosy feel to the place too"}
{"text":"If you want tasty, simple Italian food this place is your jam. Wonderful service, really great pasta and delicious sides. If you're looking for a warm, welcoming place to eat a great meal, go here."}
{"text":"This place is borderline the best place in the junction. If you are up for a slightly formal, delicious and local food this is the right place! Got a reserve for 5 and ordered many different  pastas and meats for all to share, we all had a grand old time and I am sure you will too. The service is great, and the wait times are great and fast, they are spread out for full enjoyment. The 1 only problem is the price, it is very pricy, the main stake meal is 41 dollars. I definitely recommend this place for anyone who has some money to spare and wants a nice night to enjoy with friends."}
{"text":"Nuts. One of the tastiest meals I've eaten on this planet (I confine most of my reviews to establishments on this planet for practical purposes - not a travel snob).   I should start by saying I'm not a huge lover of the Italian food that I'd previously eaten although Terroni's was pretty likeable and even lighthearted Levetto wasn't bad for what it was. But this is other level isht. As in, when you put the first morsel in your mouth you have to hold on to the back of your head at the same time. Trust me, you're going to want to do this because the degree of flavour is like a shotgun blast. Granted, the food isn't overly spiced, it's just really rich and tasty, in the best way.   Simple ingredients, ingredients you can taste and pick out from the dishes, back of your head on the floor. And you'll love it.   As you step over your head back to get out the door, you'll feel sad, like you left a piece of you behind. And that's how they get you back for more.  That and the awesome food and top notch service. Really a must-try, honestly. Go now!"}
{"text":"Went to Angelino for dinner last night with a friend and wasn't very happy with the food. I eat out alot and have traveled around the world eating Italian  food,  excluding Italy. This wasn't the worst meal I had but it was pretty close. The waiter was very friendly and it seemed very talkative,  too talkative. He also tended to hover alot at the the table, maybe because the place was verually empty on a Friday night. This should have been the sign that the food wasn't very good! He mentioned that the chef was trained in Europe of Michelin star resturant and that the pasta was made on sight and that all the ingredients where freshly sourced from local producers daily. Maybe he worked at the Michelin tires store in Europe not a resturant! These other people that gave this place a five star rating either don't eat out much or diffentaly had something else, not the pasta I had. The waiter said that the poritions weren't  small like most fancy resturants but a good size, they were small!!!!! Save your money and go somewhere else to eat!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excelente food and service. We showed up without reservations at 6pm on a week day and got seated right away. Server was great: attentive, funny and gave some great tips about what to order. We liked everything we ordered, but the highlight by far are the deep fried Brussel sprouts, which are to die for!"}
{"text":"Amazing and cozy little resto tucked away in one of the nooks of the Junction! I called in advance to reserve for a party of 8 for a Saturday night. The manager was so sweet and let me make the reservation, despite the fact that they usually don't take parties bigger than 6.  The place itself is small and intimate. Friendly atmosphere, great service and amazing food!  Our waiter was so informative and helpful. He was honestly the cherry on top of the cake when it came to our experience at Angolino. The menu is small, however each item is so delicious it's obvious that they've taken the time to perfect each and every dish that's on it.  MUST-TRIES ON THE MENU: App: wild boar meatballs Main: cavaletti pasta Side: Brussels sprouts (the entire group's FAVE!!) Dessert: REAL butterscotch pudding (you'll never taste anything like it!)  We had an amazing time! I'd definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some place to have a nice quiet dinner and luckily we found Angolino.   The food was simply amazing. I ordered the beef rib main which came with beets, the missus ordered the gnocchi, and we shared a side of carrots and brussel sprouts. The beef rib was tasty and fell off the bone. The missus was really happy with her gnocchi, and we both fought each other over the sprouts and carrots. Never thought I would ever fight someone over brussel sprouts!  There were only 2 tables being served when we got, and by the time we left, the place was packed. However, the service was great and we were consistently checked on throughout our meal. We definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Decided on Angolino to host my fathers 65th birthday dinner, with family & friends. I live in the area & read the reviews on all the social media outlets, Google & Yelp since they opened. They were all positive & rightfully so.  The food was amazing. Having lived & worked in Woodbridge for 10 years, Italian food & culture became a big part of my life (I'm of German/Irish/Canadian heritage) & it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to Italian food. My wife is a big foodie & a regular to fine dining. After the meal we both agreed that was really something special. Everyone in our party was impressed with the meal, including the most important person of the day, my father.   The service was wonderful. Rozi & Tyson really know how to make you feel welcome &  made the experience a wonderful one, for my fathers birthday. Thank you to you both & all the staff at Angolino for making my fathers 65th such a wonderful experience. We will definitely be returning again.   I think when Joe C says he eats out a lot, I believe him. But maybe he should stick to the fast food, clearly his 1 review of 1 star conveniently, either makes him a little jelous of Angolinos success, or he has the pallet of a child & isn't ready for fine dining. Either way, my wife & I have been to Angolino on several occasions now, and dinner was always fantastic!!  Posted pictures of the Beef Short Rib, Angolotti, & Tyson & Rozi were nice enough to join me & my father & my girlfriend for a photo (my mom was busy enjoying herself with our guest) also posted."}
{"text":"Food was ok but found the staff to be rude and a bit sneaky (we were charged for things that were presented as complimentary). Small space and they're adding a patio which might be nice. Small drink selection. There are better Italian restaurants nearby that are much better and less pricey."}
{"text":"Great place for an anniversary. Everything was spectacular, and the owner and head chef were up front and very personable."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. The food is outstanding. The chef came to our table to talk to us because we came with my 4 year old daughter and he wanted to make sure that she would enjoy her meal. He cooks everything FRESH. Service amazing too. The best italian food we have had ever!"}
