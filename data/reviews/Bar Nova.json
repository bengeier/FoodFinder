{"text":"The food is fantastic and the menu is excellent. Very fun atmosphere. Great new spot in Avon worth checking out."}
{"text":"Avoid!

Place is overpriced and is not up to par. They keep reinventing every couple of years. 
You get 8 (4eggs) for 9$. Give me a break!
Service was ok but food was average and over priced"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING is delicious! The flatbreads in the wood fired oven, the hanger steak, the deviled eggs, the tacos. I literally haven't had a bad meal here! I try to have something different every time! Basically has turned into a date night of trying new things! My husband and I plan on getting through the whole menu! They have a great selection of craft beers on tap, carry a handful of wines and make amazing mixed drinks! I personally love the pear martini. The staff has always given us excellent service, weather at a table or the bar. They always try to accommodate us even if we show up with a bigger group. This is a great spot for a date night, or to hang with friends. Even the music selection is good! This has to be one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Bar Nova. The menu was eclectic and the food was delicious. Our bartender, Shamus, was knowledgeable and very engaging with the customers. We will be back to try more of the menu."}
