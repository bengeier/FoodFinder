{"text":"Started off earlier in the evening at Kabinet while the Datcha side was slowing getting busier, and it was great being able to hit the dance floor at Datcha and then retreat to the Kabinet side to drink more Rasputins which was my favorite bourbon based cocktail. Lots of great Djs usually, kind of nice not to hear the same party hits you hear in almost every other nightclubs.  Good looking crowd ;)"}
{"text":"Rude bouncers. We had nice drinks there. Then wanted to leave. Bar was quiet (10:45 a Saturday night) we were told to wait for our taxi outside, even though no one eas in the line-up. Simply unacceptable (february = cold!!!). Customer service 101 needed ASAP. We will never come back."}
{"text":"Super loud and super dark, don't remember a whole lot else but I woke up with my shoes and coat on. Two stars?"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here because it's so close to my place and seemed cool but I was totally disappointed...  1) I love music and loud club music at that, but this was just unbearable and the sound quality was terrible 2) It took 25 minutes for them to make an f-ing drink, I don't need the dried elderberry root thanks, just make me a vodka soda in under an hour, that would be great 3) they left door wide open and everyone was freezing with their coats on and its insanely dark, not cool club dark, like bump into everyone , trip on shit dark  Sorry Datcha not loving you"}
{"text":"Located in mile end this is a cool venue in a cool spot of town. Great club, great music, great service and wonderful selection of Vodka drinks. They make one of my favourites, vodka and apple juice. They have a cool name for it but I can't remember what it is.  Anyway a great night out"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite bar/club experiences in a while. All of the employees (bouncers, coat check girl, etc., were cool/nice which is pretty rare in MTL. Because we went before 11pm, we didn't have to pay the $7 cover charge and we got free coat check SWEET! The music and crowd got progressively better as the night went on, almost setting me in a trance. The place is very small and gets very crowded past midnight. When we left at 1am to catch the last metro, the lineup outside was intense!! So happy I finally got to visit and will for sure go again."}
{"text":"Only been once, on a cold and icey winter night. Live DJ. Great place to dance, had so much fun. Bartenders and staff were good too. Five stars is for dancing. Gets pretty full."}
{"text":"Went to Datcha for the first time this weekend. I love electronic music and wanted to try a new spot. Again since it was my first time I cannot speak in general, however the line-up was good and I really enjoyed the music. However the place is small and does not fit a lot of people therefore it gets crowded and busy on the dance floor. Moreover because of the size the place, the coat check service for people getting in and out is slow, meaning that we had to wait 25 minutes outside at -18C before getting inside. Will give it another try for the music."}
{"text":"Datcha is a peculiar place. It consists of two separate rooms. The first room is dark with an opened space for dance floor and this is where the kids play. The music is loud and as my Russian friend said, they could have picked some better tunes for a Russian theme bar. Besides that there is a smoke that is supposed to make the dance floor more intriguing, but sometimes it is so much that it will actually prevent you of seeing around.   The beauty of Datcha is its Kabinet, the cabinet is the second room where the mad Russian scientists invent crazy cocktails, it is small, brightly decorated and cute. They have short menu of classical Russian snacks, well balanced cocktails, some beers on tap and shots of vodka of course, the Russian Mule and Russian Spring are worth trying.   Basically the cabinet wins four stars for Datcha, it is classy, even the blond female bar tender was classy with her hairdo and red lipstick. The problem is the smoke, the very same smoke from the kids room kept entering the cabinet and making it less pleasant. If the smoke is gone next time I am in the cabinet I will upgrade the stars.  Special kudos to the body gards. They were nice, persuaded us to get in, even one of them showed us the very same cabinet."}
{"text":"I had a good time here last night. Came for about an hour around midnight. Ordered some drinks, drank them, had a chat. It was a nice time. Not exactly my type of venue, there's a laser and smoke machine and house music, but we sat on the side and had some drinks and had a good time. Drinks were excellent and didn't take a long time as others have said."}
{"text":"Fun place -- good music and good crowd. Would definitely recommend if you're into house music and good vibes. Not too much sleaze or ick ;)"}
{"text":"I liked this club. But it has a very particular crowd... if you're in to tech house and house music (not the commercial crap) than this is the place for you. The dance floor was packed and everybody was having a good time. Although there's a lot of bumping into people and spilling drinks... I should add they have an extremely irritating strobe light pointed directly at the crowd that doesn't stop flashing all night!  Drinks were ok, reasonably priced for a club and bouncer was very friendly. The little pub area inside seemed really cool too. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favourite club in the city. Really respectful bouncers. Cute coat check girls and hot music. Always down to go to datcha."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation and wow... what a waste of an hour we spent here!   We got here around midnight on a Friday night and there was no line. Ok, we walk in but then had to pay a cover. Whatever, I guess it's a cover and coat check rolled into one, which is fine. We walk in and it was DEAD. There were maybe 10 people in the open room and some music playing. The other room had more people in it, but still not a lot.   The whole place was super dark and smoky... and the music was not even dance-able.   We ordered vodka cranberry... Those were fine and regular priced.   Honestly, we left after one drink so we can salvage our night.   I think it says something when no one has written a review in a while..."}
