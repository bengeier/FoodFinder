{"text":"Great spot for a quick coffee, latte, cap, and of course Japanese style cold brew. Good selection of pastries and snacks. Right in the heart of downtown PHX, they even have a lovely patio to enjoy your morning starter."}
{"text":"Was killin' myself @ Cartel a couple blocks over, trying without success to figure out a coffee style that really clicked for me. Full disclosure: I'd just as soon drink Circle K coffee as the fancy stuff. Don't get me wrong - I really enjoy the fancy stuff. But, if I'm gonna pay premium dollars for premium brews, it better darn taste premium.  Which brings us full circle to Mornin' Moonshine. Decided I just couldn't find the right fit at Cartel, so I stumbled in here one morning. Hot diggity dog, I was Goldi-friggin-locks, this was just right! Excellent balance and flavor out of their cold brew coffee, which you can see dutifully brewing away on the back counter behind the register. (The Cowboy Moon blend is my personal fave -- a touch smoky, but still smooth, no crazy/distracting Taste-the-Rainbow of acidic notes.) If you wanna get real crazy, they often have some cool cold brew infusions going on -- orange and ginger, jalapeno and lemon, etc.   Look, it's fancy coffee -- it ain't cheap. Sometimes my cheapskate self can dig that; sometimes I'm hittin' Circle K. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. But, for those mornings when you wanna #treatyoself, Mornin' Moonshine will take care of you right good."}
{"text":"I had a cappuccino here on a quick trip to phoenix--unfortunately, it was a letdown. Though it wasn't overly milky, the espresso was very burnt/bitter, and the milk tasted a bit scalded.   Perhaps worse, however, were the baristas, who were pretty unfriendly. The baristas were also playing very loud and obnoxious music (not something I would normally care about/notice--it sounded like techno remixes of folk pop songs).   The space is really cute and the pastries look tasty. Hopefully I just caught them on an off day!"}
{"text":"Nice little place, great ambiance, coffee was great, pastries were fresh, and I was pleasantly surprised by the price (especially with free refills.) 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love the Japanese cold brew! And it doesn't hurt that I work in the same building. Reasonable prices and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place better - cool vibe, downtown location, the barista was awesome, but...the espresso was ok, and...paper cups - no real cups.  Seeing as it was National Donut Day, we got donuts (brought in from Rainbow Donuts) - they were just ok, too.  I think if they got some real cups...and changed beans...they'd have a good shot a 4 star."}
{"text":"Very good tasting coffee but it's also a bit pricey for my taste. I paid $6 for a 20oz iced coffee. Nothing special just iced coffee with cream. They do have Almond milk for those who have lactose issues."}
{"text":"DAMN IT, Mornin' Moonshine! I have many, MANY vices as anyone can tell by the number of bars of reviewed. The problem is that I am surrounded by enablers who make me drink, and smoke, and drink coffee. And now here you are, on the first floor of my building, enabling my coffee habit.  That's right, all I have to do now is hop on the lift down to the first floor and there you are. Make no bones about it, I am thrilled as hell, and Sydney and the rest of the girls are a hoot. It's always such a nice way to start the day with their smiling faces and of course, the coffee.   They served the same cold-brewed coffee that is served at Vovomeena, so fans working downtown need now walk only a few blocks. I cannot bring myself to drink cold coffee. Even when it's 120 degrees out I will drink my coffee hot. While I might have to bite the bullet and give it a try, for the time being I'm happy with my Americano.  Anyway, these guys have just opened up but so far they've given me what I want without a hitch. It's worth checking these guys out in the newly designed 111 Tower."}
{"text":"Of course - nothing but the best from the people who brought you Tuck shop!  Fantastically subtle and flavorful infused coffee. Such a great addition to downtown NOT just another coffeeshop! SHOUT OUT TO LAURA - YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting for work and there's a Starbucks in the lobby of my hotel and I decided to skip out on over roasted coffee. I read a great review about Mornin' Moonshine and I had to have the same experience! Walked right in and regrettably asked for \"something cold\" and instead of a cold shoulder she offered me THREE different infused cold brews. Well ok that sounds amazing. I went with the cocoa and cinnamon cold brew and it WAS amazing. I drank it with a drop of almond milk. The adorable barista with pink hair made my mornin'."}
{"text":"Yikes. Ummmm ... this coffee was not great. Specifically, I had a latte and it was watery tasting and what flavor it did have was \"marginal at best\"."}
{"text":"They have great cold brew and there's never a line. It's super cute, good wifi and very friendly service. I'll be walking here instead of the more standard coffee purveyors downtown."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee and a friendly place. Best coffee shop in all of downtown. Cold brew coffee is delicious and of course I always enjoy their standard espresso drinks. Regular brew coffee is darn good too. Love the design and friendly staff. Great meeting spot for downtown--just grab a cup and linger in the 111 W. Monroe building lobby or outside."}
{"text":"Cold brew with caramel is where it's at!! Soo good!  Also, the bagels are the best bagels ever and you have a variety of options in regards to cream cheese."}
