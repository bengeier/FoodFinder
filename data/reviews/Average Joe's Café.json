{"text":"Our entire family loved our breakfast here.  We were very warmly greeted and served.  The food was delicious - steaming hot, tasty and well plated.  Definitely a place to return to!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous brekkie at a price that doesn't hurt. My Hungry Joe's plate of sausage and eggs was so pretty it was almost a shame to demolish it. Eggs perfectly over easy, toast grilled tender and crispy, potatoes ditto. The only thing that didn't go well above and beyond my expectations (and for $7 this is not a complaint, just an observation) is that the sausages were just your regular supermarket-style pork sausages.

All this and the latte was one of the best we've had in Toronto. Drip coffee was just fine.

Great little place. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Best Brekkie and coffee I've had so far I must say ! The medium baked eggs are yummilicious with their thick toast wholemeal bread! 
Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place knows how to do it right! They make food with FRESH ingredients & the fact that it's a family run business, you just feel like they are feeding you right in their own dining room. They do not have a whole lot in their menu but try anything & you will immediately see what i mean. It's food & service done right! It's one of those places where you feel good after being there:).. Say Hi to Joe when you are there, he is usually the guy lovingly preparing your food for you. Oh and did i say that the food there is CHEAP! This place should have a spot in \"The Best Brunch/Breakfast place in Toronto\"."}
{"text":"Average Joe's is definitely not average at all! The service and food is all good. My boyfriend and I stop here a lot for breakfast, especially in the summer because they allow us to sit out on their \"patio\" (a few chairs set up outside) with our pup. 

We most often order the Hungry Joe and of course some bottomless coffee (the sign of a good breakfast place). It's usually a little much for me but I always order it because I can't leave this place without eating some turkey bacon. I would order a bag of their bacon if I could."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for a weekend trip, and this cafe is THE way to start the day off! 
After a 2 hour drive in the early morning, all I wanted to do was settle down, find parking, and relax with some good breakfast and coffee. 

Average Joe's Cafe is perfect in that it is already located snug in the middle of two areas of interest (Kensington Market and Chinatown), and right next to a public parking garage that only charges $6 for the whole day. Can it get any better??

It's a very small place - maybe only 4-5 tables that seat 2-4 at a time. Very cozy setting, and sweet staff. I ordered the yelp-famous baked eggs while my friends ordered the Hungry Joe's. The server gave me the option to choose medium or well done eggs. I opted for the medium, and it was so delicious spread onto the thick slices of bread each breakfast comes with. I definitely recommend the eggs, and the stars of the other breakfasts are definitely the THICK slices of toast that comes with it.

We also ordered two drinks - the cinnamon dolce latte, and London Fog(this one really just because we were curious to see what it was). London Fog is Early Grey Tea Latte, haha. You can tell from the latte art that each order was made with care :) 

Average Joe's Cafe gave me a wonderful first impression to Toronto. Each item on the menu is actually very simple - your typical breakfast options, but they were all prepared so well. Wish my neighborhood had a similar cafe! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore Average Joe's. I stumbled across this gem one day while wandering around Kensington Market getting increasingly hungry and cranky with the other over crowded breakfast options in the area. It's  a small cafe tucked away that you could easily miss. Steady customers but never too busy, I have never had to wait for a seat.

The owners recognize me and are always super nice and the atmosphere is relaxed. The coffee is good and the prices are fantastic for an excellent classic breakfast. Though I've tried the baked eggs (and they were good!) I tend to stick with the \"Hungry Joe\" brekkie of scrambled eggs, toast, potatoes, tomato and your choice of turkey bacon or sausage because it's just so damn good.

Eggs are fluffy, toast is fresh and thick sliced, and the potatoes are fantastic and well seasoned. Very hearty without the heart attack attached that you can find in some overly greasy breakfast joints, Average Joe's is certainly not that. This is home cooked goodness each and every time which will keep me coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab a warm drink in Kensington and decided to pop in. The instant I walked in the door I feel in love with the kitchen/ counter set up. The cafe has a really warm vibe and an interesting selection of tea. The staff were extremely friendly. The only bad thing with the place was the limited menu. Breakfast food but no desserts or other sweets :(

Overall I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"A small little breakfast nook around the corner from Our Spot, that puts up a rather promising battle. 

The staff are as friendly as they get before 4PM and the atmosphere is wonderfully relaxed. All that being said, it's the food that has me hooked. 

The Hungry Joe comes with a hearty portion of chicken bacon, a HUGE piece of toast, and a solid hunk of hash topped with fried garlic, all finished off with a grilled tomato, and of course, your eggs for under $10.  

The only thing I would say if you're in a hurry, call ahead. Quality can't be rushed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately did not get there in time for the breakfast items but had a sandwich which was still pretty good. The service was ok, the food did take a while but I will give them a try next time see if it changes. Coffee is good. 
Price is really good. Affordable."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and was surprised at the tiny operation size. Needless to say, we arrived early in the morning and did not have to wait to be seated.

I had the meat omelet served with roasted tomato and roasted potatoes. All the food was cooked very well and for the price, you can't beat the value. The server was also quite attentive to our needs. I would definitely return to this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go on a date. Place is not really big, about 5 tables with seating and benches. The server (and I guess probably the owner) is very friendly and patient.

I ordered a chicken cheese sandwich. The ingredients they use are definitely fresh. You can also ask for special flavors and they'll do their best. Got the home fries on the side but I wasn't impressed by those as they were soggy."}
{"text":"Came here on an early Sunday morning. Place is small. We were lucky only available table was for 4. Perfect for us! We went here based from yelp reco. Not sure why yelp is showing it as \"$\" because this place isnt cheap. 
We ordered 2 kinds of omelette and french toast. Nothing extraordinary. However, the toast that came with the omelette and what they used for the french toast was good.
This place is cash only. No washroom."}
{"text":"First time here at Average Joe's Cafe and I found it above average.  Small but cozy, AJ seems to be a popular spot with friendly staff.  I found it on BlogTO listed under the Best of Cheap Breakfast.  Unfortunately, I think the review was old as the $5.50 Average Joe breakfast has been rename as the Hungry Joe and is price at $7.95.  Still a great breakfast with thick cut toast, chicken bacon or 3 piece yummy sausage, thick fried tomatoe, a unique homemade fried potato circle and two large eggs."}
{"text":"had a lovely breakfast here cooked fresh to order. also the coffe was amazing. would definately go back again. the only issue i would say is once the place got full the service got a bit slow. other that the food was very good"}
{"text":"Great little place, friendly service , amazing thick toast. Will be back to try something else"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place near Kensington market, with a very homely feel and amazing food. Great place for a nice Sunday morning catch up with friends. Would definitely come here again in the near future"}
{"text":"I found Average Joe's while wandering the Kensington Market area off Chinatown, and instantly fell in love, making it my home-away-from-home for this visit. A small (25' x 30') family-owned cafe w/seating for 15 max (never full while I was here), in business for 9 months, specializing in espresso drinks, bagels, and grilled breakfasts in Winter, and special homemade fruit slushies (like Watermelon) in summer when the neighborhood is at its most alive with activity. Open 7-7 M-S, and 8-6 Sunday. Loving and cosy, the appeal is as much in the mixed ethic clientele as in the food. I LOVED it!!! Free wi-fi for now, could change. Tell the brothers - Albert and Joe - that Bill sent you."}
{"text":"I visited this place today for the first time.  So nice and cozy and friendly.

I had the baked eggs ($6.50, coffee not included), and I thought it was really different and delicious.  It came with a nice salad, delicious bread, and a sort of potato pancake, which was good for dipping in the baked egg.  Good coffee, and nice tea selection, too!

There are not many items to choose from, so beware if you are picky.  Also, someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I couldn't spot a bathroom......?

I will certainly be back for more.  It's great to have a cheap brunch in the market!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. Had the Baked Eggs and a Latte. Will definitely return when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my go-to place for breakfast! It's a cozy joint in the Kensington market, and is definitely a local fave! The staff is very friendly, and the food is amazing. I always get the Hungry Joe breakfast with their chicken bacon. So good!"}
{"text":"As a lover for breakfast, I've tried all the places in Ottawa and when I came down to Toronto (to visit a close friend of mine), we found Average Joe's from some Yelp searching the night before. We needed to do breakfast at 7 am, nice and early, and the only other place open was Coras (but we've beeen there and done that and wanted to find somewhere different) and yelp ratings seemed decent.... 

The people are super sweet and did a great job making sure things were well with us. We were promptly seated and yes, the food did take about 10-15 mins to cook but we were pleasantly surprised... everything was just different in terms of flavours but in a good way. It looked pretty small when I first got it but gosh, I didn't even get to finish. Satisfied for sure. Small menu but unique taste!  I will probably come back next time I visit! :)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Been to this place several times for drinks (which are amazing, too - best vanilla latte I've had) and finally went in for breakfast. The Hungry Joe was fantastic - too much to eat so I had to decide which part I liked least to leave behind...hard decision. It's very reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food you get. Definitely a place to visit when you're in Kensington! (NB cash only!)"}
{"text":"Ah average joe's. This lovely place has been a gem in my life. Not only is the food simple and delicious, the coffee hot and rich but the owner truly a wonderful soul. My partner and I have been coming here once a year or so for the last 6 years and he still recognizes and remembers both us and our orders. All the good feels!"}
{"text":"$5.50 plus tax \"Hungry Joes\" at Average Joe's: two eggs, sausage or chicken bacon (wtf is that made out of?), homefries and toast.  Coffee ($1.75 not included but free refills and tasty) 

Would not get this again: sausage was whatever, homefries even with hot sauce & salt were so bland that I ate a bite and glared at the rest with perturbed disdain for the remainder of the meal, eggs and toast were good but if I had known they had a Montreal sesame bagel breakfast sandwich with eggs and cheese ($3.50) which isn't on the menu, I would have ordered that instead. 

Total with tax and tip $10 and I'm eating a toasted English muffins two hours later as I write this. Not returning and made me wish Avenue Open Kitchen was open on the weekends.

Note:  Cash only, coffee not included, great service, exposed brick wallpaper, 10 seats.

Average Joe's 161 Baldwin, open everyday 7-4pm"}
{"text":"I went there reading all the rave reviews mentioned in Yelp. It was a mistake. I didn't realize most of the reviews on here are old. Maybe it was good back then. The couple seemed nice, the place is as described in other reviews. I had ordered double baked eggs. The food was plated well but it arrived very late (the host did apologize for that) though there were not many people in the restaurant. And the food was salty! especially the home style fries. I think it was cooked with bacon grease which some might like but it is not my thing. The eggs were ok and the thick slices of bread was probably the only thing not salty. The cuppuccino was just ok nothing exceptional. 1 star in my books for the food taste."}
{"text":"Delicious food! great, friendly service too. Cute, cozy space. We came on a weekday morning so were able to grab a table without a wait. 

All of us loved our meals and drinks.

*French toast 5/5: deliciousness! Agree with other reviews.

*Baked eggs 4/5: I found the eggs a bit bland but that's just personal preference as I love salt! The potatoes were excellent. 

*London fog: I got the decaf. This was soooo delicious. So smooth and creamy. Would like to try the other drinks on the menu

Can't wait to come back to try other items on their menu. We saw the next table order the club sandwich and it looked yummy."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Had the French toast and baked eggs. French toast definitely quite special, thick and soft. Baked eggs were also quite different but extremely nice. It's such a small place but a great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"Great food!  Baked egg is awesome!!  Really enjoyed the meal. Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing breakfast (not the same old breakfast u get everywhere else) and amazing latte. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and their noodles is good too.  Wish there was more ventilation and it smells really greasy inside, and you will smell like the restaurant for the rest the day.  But the staff is super friendly.  Will definitely come back. : )"}
{"text":"Baked eggs are great. The service is friendly and great. Had heard of this place through a friend and so glad I went. I wish it was bigger, but it just means I have to get there early."}
{"text":"Went there this morning! Excellent service and delicious food! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Average Joe's is a small, unassuming cafe in the heart of Kensington Market. We decided to give it a try, having already been to Our Spot (see other review) and wanting to try somewhere new. 

From the moment we walked in, the owners (family-run) were super friendly and took our orders quickly.

The food took a while to arrive but was hot and fresh. I had the Hungry Joe which came with three eggs and either sausage or bacon. I chose sausage.

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the sausages were excellent. I wasn't too sure about the potato patty but it grew on me. I think mine was a little overcooked but it was still pretty good. My favourite part of the meal was the hand sliced toast, it was so good and the slices were pretty thick. Their jams are also excellent.

Breakfast for two came to $17.50 which is pretty good. I saw someone eating the baked eggs and it looked excellent, so that is on my list for next time. We will be back for sure!

Tip: cash only!"}
{"text":"I like it. I will bring some friends. Very affordable and cozy place. If you go alone, the only bad thing is they don't have free wifi. And washroom is outside of the place and far."}
{"text":"The service and food were both great. The servers and cooks were very friendly as they periodically checked on you to make sure everything was fine. The food was affordable in relations to the proportions and it was well cooked. This is the perfect place to catch up with friends over brunch!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most carefully prepared and attractively presented breakfasts on our now 135 week tour of breakfast spots in Toronto (~115 different establishments).

Owners Joe and his wife are hospitable hosts, serving many regulars in this tiny hole-in-the wall.

I decided to try the Baked Eggs while both my friends had the Hungry Joe. My dish included 2 eggs, baked in a large ramekin with chopped roma tomatoes and basil. It included \"home fries\", toasted baguette and a mixed green salad. 

The Hungry Joes included 2 eggs (any style), chicken bacon or pork sausages, \"home fries\", chunky toast, grilled tomato and garnish. Each dish had a different garnish - one included kiwi, the other sliced grapefruit.

Everything was prepared very well (D.O. proclaimed the over easy eggs \"perfect) and very artfully presented.

Why am I adding quotation marks to the \"home fries\"? Well, Joe's version was different than any I've ever seen. It appears that a whole, unpeeled potato is boiled, then sliced into hockey puck sized pieces, then fried and spiced on each side. They were different, and tasty, but I wouldn't call them home fries.

Definitely a good breakfast option in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Love this place, best toast ever. And must try baked egg."}
{"text":"Joe's is my fave!

This humble cafe is tiny but well worth it! 

Joe and his brother know all the locals by name and/or order and although their menu is small and simple, it is always freshly made and served with care. Who doesn't like food like that?

Their London fogs are top notch and in the summer they make watermelon slushies that are the best treat on hot day."}
{"text":"Uncomfortable chairs, no wifi (although this seems a constant abomination in Toronto...), uninspired coffee, but the singular best home fries and bacon I have ever seen. Anywhere."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my breakfast. Baked was something I'd never tried, but it was good. The hash brown were awesome. Great feel- the owner is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee shop right in the heart of the Kensington market. We only got the hot chocolate which was very delicious. They make cool designs with the chocolate they put on the top which is pretty cool. The food looked amazing but we did not get a chance to have any this time. The owner and workers are all very nice as well. If you find yourself in the Kensington market make sure you do yourself a favor and stop at average joes."}
{"text":"Just stumbled angels this place by accident and super glad I did. A very small,  cozy place with very friendly staff. I ordered the baked eggs which were delicious and incredibly affordable.  The homefries,  salad and baguette which were also very good. Portion size was perfect. 

Only thing stopping me from giving 5 is the coffee.  Ordered a drip and it really isn't good.  They have an espresso machine...may try that next time."}
{"text":"What a small little place! I've walked past it for years, but never noticed it. I was looking for a place for a Thursday 11am brunch (harder than it should be). Well, Yelp showed some good review for this place, and it was in the right area, so we (Alysse R) and I decided to give it a try!

Options are limited (4 choices), but good. I had the \"average joe's breakfast\" which included two eggs, three pieces of chicken bacon, a potato cake, and half a fried tomato. My friend ordered the baked eggs. I really enjoyed both dishes (Alysse was kind enough to let me taste... and I just realized that I did not repay the offer... BAD FRIEND.)

Coffee and tea had free refills, and as we sat we saw lots of regulars come in. The owners knew not only their names, but their beverages of choice.

We sat for over an hour and enjoyed our breakfast. Two breakfasts with a coffee and tea (with refills) came to about $17. Money Well Spent."}
{"text":"So so. Bread was too salty. Service was great though, both the owner and server were very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This nondescript seeming little place offers surprisingly delicious, healthy, creative and fresh fare for a very good price. The owner is a friendly and helpful guy and cooks the food himself, and breakfast standards come out with tasty twists--- baked eggs! Inexplicably delicious Korean style noodles in the AM! Yes! More! Two breakfasts! 


Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super friendly service here in a spot off the main drag.  I was really happy to eat here as it's a nice little spot, owned by locals and the food is great!

From the light fluffy bread to the great ingredients in the omelette I had to the perfectly cooked home fries, this place was spot on!  

Definitely hit them up and get peanut butter on your toast - tasty!"}
{"text":"There's nothing average about this place! Great food, fast service and fantastic prices! Highly recommend this spot to someone looking for a casual joint for delicious coffee and great homecooking."}
{"text":"Average Joe's Cafe is anything but! It's an above average spot in a lively part of town. The French Toast is awesome, they offer a lot in the way of other options. As someone visiting the city, you'd be hard pressed to find a better way to start the day off!"}
{"text":"It's a cute little place for weekdays brunch or coffee since it's usually packed during weekends. Came here on a Wednesday morning and enjoyed the Baked Eggs from their menu. 

The staffs were cute and friendly! Came over to ask if the food was okay and poured coffee for me every now and then.

The downside was the potato. It was really dry and a little hard (as if it was raw)

Nevertheless, I would still come back and try other food on the menu!! And would suggest coming during weekdays!"}
{"text":"Location: Kensington market. I'm not sure how to get there by transit but the market does have indoor parking if you need it. 

The place: TEENY tiny! You probably wouldn't even think about having breakfast here but stop - it's totally worth it. The place looks more like a small coffee shop than a breakfast joint, with just a few tables inside, and 4 tables outside. Nothing fancy.

The goods: I had eggs with hash and rye bread, along with an iced coffee. Everything was delicious! The portions were quite large (for me, anyway) and served piping hot. The iced coffee was really nice and refreshing and can be sweetened if you ask. 

Service: Super friendly guys - they greeted us when we got there, got us a table outside and checked in to make sure everything was good. 

Price point: Cheap! I think the breakfast was $7 but you wouldn't think it, considering the quality and portion sizes. GREAT find!"}
{"text":"The staff here are so friendly!! Such a cute little spot in Kensington. Food was very good. If you're looking for a basic, fresh, reliable breakfast, this is the place to be. You taste the ingredients in the meal, not just salt or seasoning.

I ordered the soy latte. At first I was worried it'd be too sweet for my liking (cause they use sweetened soy milk), but it turned out just right because the hint of sweetness balanced out the bitterness of the espresso.

For food, I got the baked eggs. Very well presented, and the ingredients tasted fresh. Nothing was overly salty, and I liked the bacon bits on the big home-fry round. 

All of this came out to about $15 incl tax and tip, which is great for brunch/lunch. For me, the friendly staff and service are the main reason I would come back here.

Note that they only accept cash. Also, that their bathroom is in the parking garage, so you have to venture a bit to get there."}
{"text":"Maybe the best latte I ever had!

Nice spot, air conditioned, good decor and very clean 

Tip: look for the brick walls that are actually just wallpaper lol"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a sandwich and coffee! The staff is super friendly and the location is perfect. The restaurant offers a cozy environment to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced food! My husband and I enjoyed our time here- unfortunately they ran out of home fries, if not would have made the meal tastier. Was slow with the food as it was a small kitchen and looked there was only 1 chef- but it was definitely worth it in the end! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"It's very small, so it's a luck of a draw to get a seat depending on what time you come it. But the food was very tasty and homemade. The bread was out of this world- I still crave it from time to time since I'm not from the city. 

It's very cute and it's a great pit stop in the morning."}
{"text":"its the thick wheat bread that makes the breakfast here   really great spot for breakfast   nice staff"}
{"text":"Average Joe's is an excellent choice for a hearty, yet still cheap n' cheerful, breakfast in Kensington Market. For under $6, you'll get a heaping platter of eggs, grilled tomato, bacon, thick pieces of homestyle bread, and home fries (which is really a baked and broiled potato with some sort of savory crunchy seasoning thing that is far tastier than it sounds). I mean really, you can't go wrong! And lest you feel guilty about eating swine, their bacon is made from chicken. And it actually tastes like bacon! (I don't say that lightly. I am, after all, a girl who likes her bacon.) 

Even though this was my first visit, Joe and his staff warmly greeted my dining companion and I like we were regulars. Cozy is definitely the word -- the place only has five tables. When we arrived, it was not crowded and we were able to sit down right away. The food takes a little longer than your typical egg-slinging greasy spoon, but that's because they cook everything fresh to order. No heat lamps here! 

The only negative note is that the menu is extremely limited. There are only 3 menu items, so if you don't want one of those three, you're kind of screwed. But if you want cheap eggs and bac-ey to go with your wakey wakey, then stumble on over to Average Joe's."}
{"text":"This would be my 2nd time visit at this little breakfast nook. 
The goods - The meals are very delicious and cheap. Staff are friendly.
The bad - if it's busy, there's only a few places to visit and wait. If there's too many people are waiting, your meals gets taken too quickly :( Their coffee and hot chocolate drink sucks though."}
{"text":"The banana French toast was so good! 

On the pricy side!

Cash only which was disappointing. We got far less than we wanted to."}
{"text":"We came for an early lunch on our way though Kensington Market.  Overall, everything was fine, but I'd probably try something else next time.  The place is really small - a few tables inside and a few tables outside.  We ordered a chicken salad and a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.  I enjoyed the sandwich, but should have ordered a side with it because it was mostly bread.  The chicken on the chicken salad was really good, but it was served atop of a pile of mixed greens and not much else.   

Pro tip - don't come in here expecting to use the bathroom.  There is one, sort of, but it isn't worth the expedition through the parking garage to get to it."}
{"text":"Great value and decent food

The service was quick and attentive. The food is pretty good with fairly large portions. Grabbed the hungry joes breakfast and it definitely hit the spot and more. Ice coffees were a great way to cool us down on the hot summer morning. Nothing crazy extravagant but the price will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in Kensington!
My husband and I still make the \"trek\" down even though we've moved to Davisville.  The owners recognize us and always are friendly, even if the place is busy. 

There is not a lot of space, but I truly believe that if this place was in Leslieville, there would be a line-up around the corner.  

I always get the Hungry Joe with eggs over easy, sausage with Rye toast or their baked eggs (their specialty).  Their coffee is delicious and so it their London Fog (no sugar, only vanilla syrup).  If I've already eaten breakfast, I go for their spicy noodles with cucumbers and it's divine, if you want to get extra fancy, get an egg on top."}
{"text":"Very neat place run by a young couple. We had baked egg, french toast and veggie omelet with thick toast... yumm.

Coffee was also very good and strong. 
Just remember, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Very very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Great coffee and stuff. Nice for to go, a bit to loud and jammed to sit there and try to focus or have a conversation."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow!! The best French toast I have Ever had! We are talking thick cut toast, soft and doughy like centers, fresh bananas topped with the perfect amount of cinnamon and syrup!!! Let's not forget the chicken bacon that is simply on another level. The cafe is small and seats about 15 people; but I assure you, it is worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"A classic breakfast for $5.50 - eggs, sausage or bacon, homefries (made from real potatoes!!), a slice of tomato and toast. 

The coffee is quite good too. 

& Free Wi-fi!! Just ask them for the password.

It's nothing fancy or especially special, besides the price, so it gets 3 stars. It's just good, cheap eats. 
If you know a place for even cheaper version of this breakfast...let me know."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast this morning (May 01st)..this was our second visit. We ordered a nice breakfast for 2. The Asian Gentleman who runs the place (also the cook) was extremely rude. I asked him for some toast and jam and he was not amused...he said something under his breath and it was nothing pleasent. I usually am not a demanding person, but I had to ask for everything, because the waitress was too busy to refill our coffees...bring us coffee cream etc. The cook would look at me very dirty when I asked to order a few more items on the menu. He made us soo uncomfortable!
We finished our breakfast and paid our $30 tab and left. I will probably never ever visit that place again....
Advice for the cook/owner:  \"I was going to leave you a nice tip, but ur bad attitude prevented me for doing so.....djust because you had a bad day, doesnt mean ruining ur customers nice day\"!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since late last year. It's my routine to my Saturday morning grocery and meat run in Kensington Market. I first stop at Average Joe's for a cafe latte before I do my grocery run. I can't say I have done my shopping if I have not started here. It's just the perfect start to a wonderful shopping experience.

What I like about Average Joe's is the brightly lit (natural light), cozy space. You think it will be full but once inside, to your delight, you find a free table.  Joe always greets me with a smile, whether I'm a regular, the Saturday regular or the every other Sat regular. His genuine and warm smile makes me feel welcomed.  I notice he knows the locals and talks to them and greet them just as welcoming.

Unlike other hipster coffee shops in the Market, where they scowl at your and will only greet you warmly if you are friends with the person working the counter. Another thing I dislike about those places is how dark they are!

Finally, their cafe latte is a delight! I'm not a coffee drinker but I absolutely adore their cafe latte. I sip it. I relax. I daydream. Heck, I once was eating tortillas I bought from Emporium Latino and they did not scowl or admonish me for bringing outside food!  

It's a true oasis and laid back coffee shop, and I will continue returning. After all, it's my Kensington Market experience!"}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times and will probably come for even more multiple times! The server and cook is amazingly friendly and caring. 

It's a tiny, cozy cafe that's great for brunch or lunch with a friend. The price is worth the food and it's ALWAYS tasty. 
I got the Hungry Joe's which includes a house salad, a piece of toast that I substituted with a tomato, and turkey bacon. The house salad was probably my favourite part because it was plated so nicely, topped off with cornnuts.

The only downsides is that if you need to use the bathroom you have to go to the Go Parking lot which is a bit sketchy... it's also a cash-only place. 

However, I would definitely come here again with a friend! :) You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here after reading all the great reviews on yelp and I was not disappointed! The shop is small but very cozy. Run by two brothers, Average Joe's serves food and coffee that is way above average! I had a breakfast sandwich with eggs and sausage and it was delicious! Nothing like that processed stuff you get at tim hortons or mcdonalds. They use fresh ingredients and make everything on spot. Some of their staff was away when I went and thus they were only serving sandwiches. Would come back to try the baked eggs!"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and this was a great start to our day trip. Please get a side of the toasts, I don't have a clue what kind of bread it was, but it was to die for. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the service was great. Side note, they don't take card so you must bring cash."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty but the prices have gone up significantly.. Don't expect to get a breakfast/brunch for under $10. It's also cash only, so come prepared. 
Most dishes use their wonderful thick cut buttered toast (either as a side or part of sandwich). The Hungry Joe no longer cones with the potato pancake - - it's replaced with homefries. The chicken breast sandwich was juicy and delicious: large piece of seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. 
But I don't think the new prices are really worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"Simple and effective. The food was good and the service good. The noodles were excellent. Great breakfast place. 

Sadly there are no bathrooms so you may want to take it easy on the coffee."}
{"text":"This is really an average place. I don't understand why the rating is so high on Yelp....

And they adjusted the price, so it is pricey for the food quality.

I will not come back and will not recommend to other people."}
{"text":"Yet another great breakfast on my trip through Canada. Average Joe's has a focused menu, that still has something for everything. Joe was extremely friendly. The atmosphere was relaxed and the service was quick and polite. The location in Kensington market allows you to enjoy your breakfast while watching the goings-on outside. The food was complemented by a fantastic americano, so I'd recommend any of their espresso-based coffees. They have a unique way of making the potato, use fresh bread that's toasted perfectly, include fresh sausages, all making up a nice no non-sense breakfast. Would recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"The food I ordered was not what I expected... See attached photo. I ordered the Hungry Joe with scrambled eggs and it's supposed to come with home fries. As you can see, I got a plain omelette instead of scrambled eggs (which they claim is scrambled), and home fries ended up being what appears to be a thickly sliced potato that was pan fried when I was expecting coursely chopped potatoes that are pan fried. I literally face palmed when I saw my order.

Wait time was 20 min but they do make everything fresh. Food isn't bad but my expectations were not met."}
{"text":"Totally ok! Super nice people as mentioned in basically every review. Tasty food for sure, just not what I was expecting from a 5 star spot. They were out of both bacon and bagels at 10:30am on a Saturday (in the market. They open at 10.) I had a grilled cheese that wasn't melted all the way through. The coffee wasn't very good. The French toast with bananas looked amazing, if I ended up here again I'd try that."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the Yelp hype, no doubt. We arrived at 10:30 AM on a Saturday morning, and the place was full (well, as full as it could get with 5 tables and a small lineup of people waiting for a grab-and-go drink). If you're looking for a very casual breakfast joint that gives you warm fuzzy feelings of comfort, the kind you can rely on to start off your day just right, this is the cafe to visit. It's quaint (read: don't expect brunch at the Ritz), it's unassuming, it's very slightly run-down - but the food and service makes up for all of it. 

First, parking - there's street parking, and it's free (albeit, at an hour maximum). We parked one block north of Baldwin Street, on Nassau Street. There were plenty of spots available when we arrived.

Second, the food. So carefully prepared and presented, right down to the small details of deliberate designs made of cinnamon - Mr. Average Joe, if you don't think we noticed how much effort you put into your dishes, we noticed, and we very much appreciated it. We ordered: a) the Baked Eggs ($8.50), b) the French Toast ($8.50), c) a Vanilla Latte, and d) a Hot Chocolate ($3.75). The Baked Eggs were so carefully cooked - delicious, soft, runny, and flavourful. The French Toast was... what can I say? It was soft, thick, soaked in the best way possible, with crunchy bacon on the side. The Hot Chocolate was delicious - it was soft, calming, unassuming - it isn't the kind of hot chocolate that slaps you in the face with its sweetness. It's the kind that puts an arm around you and calmly tells you your day is going to go just fine.

Lastly, the service. Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality and attentiveness. It was noticed and appreciated.

As an aside - tables are in very close proximity to where they cook orders, so beware, if you're wearing a nice suit or you know, a sweater you paid an arm and a leg for, be warned that you will, definitely, find the very strong lingering smell of breakfast and fried eggs on your clothing for the remainder of the day. After we left, we smelled bacon on ourselves (our clothes, our hair) for the rest of the afternoon (not that smelling like bacon is a bad thing, obviously).

For two people, we paid $30 with tax and tip included. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finding this tiny cafe (after searching Yelp for good breakfast spots in Toronto) in the heart of Chinatown and Kensington Market was like finding the prize in the Cracker Jack Box; it looked insubstantial but turned out to be very satisfying and fun. 

The place is so small it was run entirely by the chef and one other person, and our party of four took up one third of the indoor seating (and two of us had to sit on the power strip resting on the bench along the wall--a convenience for those wishing to use electronics?) but we were comfortable. 

The menu was presented on two small strips of laminated paper and offered a handful of egg dishes and a range of coffee drinks and tea. There was also a cooler of bottled soft drinks.

Our omelettes were cooked perfectly, as were their fillings, flavored with just a hint of herbs in the mixture. Home fries were hand cut as ordered (we know because the chef and the grill are arm's length from the seats) and the slices of toast were really chunks that were crunchy on the outside and still fluffy on the inside. The coffee and hot chocolate were also yummy and presented beautifully, as were the plates. 

This teeny hole in the wall had the potential to be the proverbial \"greasy spoon,\" but nothing was greasy at all. Really some of the best breakfasts we have ever had."}
{"text":"Average Joe's Cafe is so not average. It is so good. Had amazing cup of velvety latte and bacon and banana French toast there today. So satisfying. I wish I I lived closer."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast experience! The breakfast did not feel like they rushed through making all the orders, and it wasn't overly greasy like most breakfast places. The staff is so nice and takes their time preparing your food so you know it was made with pride. Loved the owners, loved the atmosphere! Will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, really hot inside but patio was a good environment. Small find in Kensington but extremely cheap in price and good quality food. Would definitely come back here again!

Loved the hash browns that are topped with deep fried garlic!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and walked almost a mile to check it out.  The breakfast sandwiches were yummy because the bread was pretty great.  I bet the French toast would be amazing."}
{"text":"A very small place with the owner/chef also taking our order. The menu is limited but the food was great. The big thick toast was grilled to perfection and it was toasty on the outside and so fresh. A grilled tomato added to our breakfast was a nice touch."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Kensingston, with cheap & delicious brunch options and a cozy atmosphere/  I'm almost afraid to review it in case it gets too busy ;) 

i came in at 1pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy, got seated right away. The place is small and cozy with about 5-6 tables for seating. It is run by a cute, young couple who serves and makes the food in front of you. 

I ordered the classic French toast with bananas & chicken bacon. TO DIE FOR, literally. For $8.50, with generous portions and the most IG-worthy plating, best value of brunch out there. Will definitely make this my new go-to."}
{"text":"This is very easy to miss walking on Baldwin; there's only a small sign in the window. A great, affordable (2 can eat here for 20 CDN) neighborhood place if you're looking to eat breakfast in Kensington Heights and is a 5 minute walk from a TTC stop on Spadina.
This place is also tiny, seats about 10 total with no bathroom in a single room. 

The owner was very friendly, also had a couple specialities that we didn't try that some Asian flavor. I had the Hungry Joe which includes hash Browns were markedly different, a very large wedge with the perfect blend of seasonings (salt, pepper, and something else that I couldn't figure out. They were not greasy either. I loved them 

My partner had a breakfast sandwich tomatoes and cucumbers inside it, an unexpected touch that complimented the eggs on it."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast due to the great comments on Yelp. We got a sandwich and some coffee. The coffee was good but the sandwich was totally burned on one side (black indeed). And it cost 6 dollars for some cucumber and tomato slices with an egg on a toast. Waste of money... If the coffees weren't that good I would have rated only 1 star. It was really disappointing. 
And yeah, cash only..."}
{"text":"What do you mean Average Joe? More like Fantastic Joe, if you ask me! Spicy Noodle had the right amount of heat and flavor (I asked for 4 out of 5 spiciness), with fresh cilantro and julienned cucumbers to balance it all out. Soy Latte was smooth and creamy too, served at the right temperature. I'm drooling thinking about it. Must go back."}
{"text":"\"What the heck are baked eggs!? I'll get one of those.\" is how our love affair with this humble little cafe at the cusp of Kensington and Chinatown started. On an earlier than usual weekday morning while most shops in the market weren't even open yet, we followed our noses (to the smell of freshly brewed coffee) and the flow of the Chinese seniors into Average Joe's. 

Every seat out front was filled with people-watching locals who clued us in to the cafe's cheap and cheerful vibe. Once inside, the friendliest barista/chef/cashier and a woman who (I assumed was his mother) cheerily greeted us from behind the counter of the open kitchen. There were surprisingly more than a few seats and tables in the considerably small room. We snagged the storefront corner table and ordered ourselves our coffees. Despite the unavailability of decaf and the espresso being far too strong (for my picky ex-barista tastes), more milk was happily added to dilute my iced latte to perfection.

The three super cheap items on the food menu include a classic breakfast, baked eggs, and spicy noodles. Now, back to the baked eggs. Two extra-large eggs (one cooked to medium, the other to well - how they do this in the same pot remains a mystery to me) and chopped tomatoes baked to perfection and served with buttered crusty toast wedges, a mountain of hearty home fries, and mixed greens topped with Cornuts (of all things!) and balsamic vinaigrette. It was already all going swimmingly until we were advised to try dipping the toast into the runnier part of the baked eggs - at which point, we melted and went to breakfast heaven."}
{"text":"If size doesn't matter, Average Joe's is proof of the saying. Step inside, and the outside world disappears. Despite the hustle of the staff, you never feel rushed. This six table cafe is one of the quaintest little spots in Kensington, and at the risk of sounding greedy, I sincerely hope it stays that way. 

Well priced, well portioned and seriously tasty."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Cozy cafe that serves all day breakfast. Had a quick breakfast bagel, fresh hot and tasty. Would return for drinks."}
{"text":"Came here around 1pm on a Saturday and tables were all full. Was told to try come back in 40 mins. 40 mins later we went back and was told most items on the menu are sold out. Did end up try the french toast, it was good but not WOW. Presentation was good (good for IG photo). Baked eggs was good but nothing special. Service was great, staff was friendly, always refilled my coffee. May come back if in area but will not purposely go again."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get breakfast! Tried to go to the Dakota at 10am on Sunday for brunch but they weren't even open! So went to Kensington and found Average Joe's! Breakfast was fresh and delicious and served by the most friendly people ever!"}
{"text":"Got the French Toast w/ chicken bacon and banana. Food was good but slightly cold when it arrived - especially the bacon. Service was very friendly and atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing."}
{"text":"I really dug the faux brick walls here. The breakfast was pretty yummy. Even though I thought I was getting regular, greasy ass bacon and instead received lean chicken bacon, I still thought it tasted delicious. The potato patty thing and the thick sliced bread were also carbilicious. For six bucks, what more do you want?

Seating was a tad scarce. We suffered through that awkward moment of wondering where we were going to sit far too long. Ended up asking a girl sitting by herself to scoot over a seat, only to up and move once a table freed up. I don't she was too impressed."}
{"text":"Good brunch place in Kensington market. The bread is really fluffy and delicious! Bagel sandwich was also very reasonably priced for the portion."}
{"text":"Average Joe is far above average. A quaint local breakfast and coffee bar in Kensington Market, on the border of Chinatown, this place makes a killer breakfast. 

I had The Hungry Joe, a fresh, hot off the grill plate of eggs over easy, thick cut toast, three sausages, and a fried potato pancake. The best slice of toast I've had in a long time. 

Service is friendly at this mom and pop place. The inside is small and there are two patio tables outside. I think right now it's more of a local secret but expect business will pick up as more Yelpers come here. They make a variety of wicked cold drinks, cappuccinos, and others caffeine infused drinks. 

Ended up being $20 including tax and tip for 2 breakfasts-wow, what a deal! An excellent breakfast contender for those who've been to the Senator, Our Spot, Sunny Morning and the likes. If the Senator is the King of brunch, this place may be it's new successor. 

Pro tip: Be patient for your order because everything is made fresh. This place is definitely off the beaten path but a solid place for breakfast and coffee. 

A five star breakfast venue for biggest bang for your buck. Come here before your weekend stroll in Kensington Market. 

Pro tip 2: No washrooms inside and bring cash. Pro tip 3: Albert and Joe are the owners and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"I came here after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews about the place, and let's just say that it lived up to the hype.

For starters, it's located in Kensington Market. It's a small place and kinda blends in with the surrounding restaurants and shops so it's difficult to see at first. But when we did find it, it wasn't quite what we were expecting. Based on the timings of Average Joe's and the way people described it, I was expecting something more like a Chez Cora, a brunch/diner feel - but what we got was more of a café environment.

The place was very small, three to four small wooden tables stationed right opposite what was the cashier and the kitchen combined, which should tell you how tiny the place is. The decor is very nice though, it's a very cosy feel and a great place to have breakfast, brunch or just grab a coffee. 

There were several reviews about their lattes and other drinks, but we just decided to go with water. We did, however, order the french toast because people were raving about it. Personally, I'm not much of a french toast eater so I don't have too much to compare it to. But from a neutral perspective, it tasted great. It wasn't too sweet like french toast I've had in the past - it had cinnamon and maple flavour and was accompanied with banana slices and two pieces of chicken bacon. The presentation was superb and the taste matched it.

We also ordered the Hungry Joe. This was fried eggs, toast, a home fry potato and three slices of chicken bacon. I liked the fact that they had the option of switching out pork sausages for chicken bacon (many places don't have that). Their slices of bread were very thick, something unique you don't see in most places, and they also had their own take on the home fry. Rather than a bunch of fried potatoes, it was more of a potato-pancake with a new taste. 

Generally, I loved the fact that they had their own spin on the dishes. The staff were extremely friendly, the location was great, and the food (for 2) ended up being for under $20. Amazing stuff."}
{"text":"This place is small and cozy, food and drinks are wonderful! Very nice staff :) also the price is a plus!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast menu at a price that can't be beat in Toronto.  Delicious coffee, wonderful home-crafted sandwiches, and an inventive menu that fits in with the kensington-market area.  

PROTIP: I would not recommend the baked eggs myself but that is just my opinion.  My partner did not enjoy them to the fullest.  I however, definitely dug my bacon and eggs.  Will be back!

Oh, and CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Lurking in the concrete alleys of Toronto, are mysterious and evil forces that hate sleep (let's call them \"slumberdaemons\") that conspire to rouse you at an ungodly hour. Slumberdaemons care not that it is the weekend, or that your bed is warm, or that there are barely any passable non-chain options open for breakfast before 7am. The slumberdaemon cackles at the sight of dark circles under your eyes, and the sound of your rumbling belly, and your screams of anguish under the slant of the rising sun.

But I had a secret weapon.

\"Step back, foul beast!\" I cried to the slumberdaemon, and I unsheathed my Black Sword Of Yelpeus, i.e., my smartphone. The slumberdaemon cocked his head in confusion as I tapped fervently against the glass, placing my finger squarely on the button marked \"Open Now.\" Average Joe's appeared on my screen and the creature was felled; sucked into a vortex and banished into the folds of the still-sleeping city.

Anyway. Average Joe's is an impossibly tiny breakfast joint in Kensington Market. The owners are beyond friendly and a warm greeting awaits you as you enter. There are only about six tables in here, and a long bench against a wall covered with faux-brick wallpaper. It's actually immaculate inside, and the place smelled it had just been hosed down and disinfected. Not a greasy spoon at all. 

Breakfast specials are the way to go. I ordered the \"Average Joe\" which is two eggs, chicken bacon or sausage, grilled tomato, home fries, and toast for $5.50. Solid deal. The toast is thick, the potatoes are crisp and tasty, and the eggs are light and perfectly cooked. The chicken bacon was well, chicken bacon. I can't complain.

With the exception of the Jazz FM playing on the radio (y'all know how I feel about the jazz) this was an exceptional place to grab breakfast. Your options are somewhat limited but what's on offer is delicious and cheap. Take that, Foul Daemons of the Night.

Obligatory Title Pun: Your better-than-AVERAGE JOE.

Menu Readability: Meh. Our menu was marked up like it was about to go to the printer. And strangely all the prices were corrected DOWN?

Need to mention: They serve breakfast all day.

What this place teaches me about myself: Wow, have I been reading too much Piers Anthony or what?"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying we walked a mile in the rain (out of wanting to save on subway tokens, but still) in order to eat here on a cold Wednesday morning, specifically because of the yelp reviews. I desperately needed this place to be worth it. 

After being greeted as soon as we walked in, we grabbed a menu and sat down. Looking around, I wasn't sure how the food was going to be, because the kitchen area was very small, and it seemed (from the small chalkboard menu) that they specialized in the coffee part of cafe offerings. The girl behind the counter, who was effectively working as hostess, waitress, and cashier, came out to ask us if we were ready with our drink order. We hadn't actually looked at the menu yet, so I grabbed it and (inexplicably, because I had never liked the taste of coffee in my entire life) ordered a vanilla latte. My date ordered a London fog, which is essentially an earl grey tea latte. When she brought the drinks a few minutes later, I ordered the French toast (sans bacon) and my date followed suit.

Now, let me tell you. I tasted his London fog. I'm not much of a tea drinker, but if every tea tasted like that, I don't think I'd drink anything else. The vanilla syrup gives it an amazing sweet flavor that negates the need for sugar. 

That being said, my latte was even better. I sipped it cautiously, expecting to find it intolerable and bitter, proving to myself yet again that I had not yet acquired the taste for coffee. I was so wrong. It was delicious. I found myself taking one huge mouthful after another, then having to stop myself from drinking it all at once after I added some sugar.

As for the food.. order the French toast. Oh my god, the French toast. We had ours on brown bread. It was cut so thick, only one slice was necessary to provide a filling breakfast. The serving came sprinkled with about half a banana, some powered sugar and decorative (and tasty) cinnamon around the plate (it also comes with bacon, which I opted out of but my boyfriend enjoyed). I order French toast almost every single time I go out to eat for breakfast, and I have been doing so since I was a kid. I need this to be understood: this was, without a doubt, THE BEST French toast I have EVER had, in my entire 22 years. To quote my boyfriend directly: \"I've never actually had a meal where I could say 'that was the best ___ i've ever had.' This is the first time I can say that with confidence.\" 

I wanted someplace worth it, and Average Joe's is it. I tipped 20% for the wonderful food and friendly service. I caught the cook's eye and he asked how everything was. We told him it was the most amazing French toast we've ever had. He shook his head modestly, and sort of shrugged, saying \"Nah, it's just Average.\""}
{"text":"This has become my favourite place to go for coffee or a casual lunch in Kensington!

Everything is yummy and prepared with care but the best thing is their customer service and attention to detail. Few places make you feel as welcomed and appreciated as Average Joe's. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Honestly, not one complaint. Quaint little place, pleasant HUMBLE staff and amazing food. We had the French toast and meatatarian omelette. Five stars all around. Great price. Love love love."}
{"text":"Went to check out this place after reading other reviews and I was not disappointed! Cute atmosphere, an amazing meal for $7, and above and beyond service at this place. Seriously, when I went to pay for my meal I was shocked that it didn't come to more - I would have paid double for what I got, and all the staff were really friendly and accommodating. Try the baked eggs, they are amazing. Great little gem in Kensington!"}
{"text":"This place really knocked my socks off.
The service was exceptional, as in, \"I didn't think people could be this nice this early in the morning\" nice.

Oh and the space is tiny, intimate and great if you're just a few people. Definitely not good for groups.

The food was wonderful- I had the baked eggs, which as other reviewers have mentioned, were great and plentiful. Also, there's something I really like about being able to get salad with breakfast (once in a while, of course.)

We finished off the meal by ordering a watermelon slushy. Can I just mention it was made with real watermelon?! Like it was basically frozen watermelon thrown in a blender. Dayum."}
