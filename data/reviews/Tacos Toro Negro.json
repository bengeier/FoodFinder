{"text":"I love coming here for the chicken sopes. Best sopes ever!!!!!! They are the best and the people there are great and friendly. The prices are good for the food you get, and the horchata is BOMB.com. I totally recommend this place if you want homemade food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada fries. It was good but had wayyyyy too much onions. Got the food pretty quick."}
{"text":"Love the tacos and the water!!! I am Mexican and this is the real deal!!! I'm so coming back!!!  Love that it's a family restaurant and the waitress was really nice!!! #lovethesalsa"}
{"text":"The family and I have been eating at this little quaint place since the time they opened. 
Without fail they have always been by far thee most comfortable and pleasant place to eat. Not without saying, the food is absolutely DELICIOUS! Today is the first time I came in and ordered a take home order. Yum! 
Carne Asada burrito, side of sopes. But, everything on the menu is top of the line YUM!"}
{"text":"just had food delivered it was great... thats some great salsa!!! I had street tacos and a GIANT chimi that i will probably eat for two days!!"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada Fries and Al Pastor Tacos in Town!!!!  Tried other places and just love it here!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great tacos and the tortillas were hand made! There was a lot to chose from on the menu. I did 4 stars because I checked yelp before we went and I was super excited to try the aguas frescas but they didn't have any made today. It was our 1st time in and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and value.   Owner is very nice.  She explained her commitment to mKe fresh ingredients daily.   Enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This is the second time we ordered ubereats from this restaurant, and again not disappointed for one bit. We ordered the chimichanga which was absolutely delicious, very flavorful and very good selection of meat. With it the beans and the rice were amazing, so very tasty the rice just had a bit of salt on it but not too much. We also had the asada tacos which were and have always been very good every time we order them, and then we also ordered the menudo which was absolutely delicious! It's hard to do menudo right, but these guys knock it out of the park, it's a shame they only do it on Saturdays. If you are looking for an authentic experience that is not dirty greasy, or sloppy, then this is your place, plus they are a local company which means the dollar stays in our community! I already cannot wait to get another creamy to get these guys again!"}
{"text":"Carne asada sopes were flavorful. Good portions and filling. Texture of beans and rice was great but not much flavor. I would visit again"}
{"text":"Not sure if I was extra hungry today and super excited about taco Tuesday or what, but the food from Tacos Toro Negro was Oh.Em.Gee bomb.com! Like no joke. Found Tacos Toro Negro on Yelp and figured I'd try it out since the reviews were fantastic! 

I explored the photos and the menu, and finally when I decided what I wanted to eat, I called in a to-go order (or you can have it delivered through GrubHub). The sweet lady who answered the phone took my order: Toro Burrito with chicken, 4 Carne Asada Tacos, and 2 Grilled Shrimp Tacos... she told me it would be ready in 15 minutes.

I arrived a wee bit early, which was no problem, because I took in all the cute decor and delicious smelling food while I waited. I especially loved that the kitchen looked like what I imagine an abuelitas kitchen would look like, and the sweet lady finishing my order took so much pride in making my order, I knew it was going to be good.

Not only was it good, but the food was the best Mexican food I've had in a while! Authentic, fresh, and made from scratch. Absolutely mouth-watering and palate-satisfying deliciousness. And the chicken burrito -- it must've weighed like five pounds, stuffed with chicken, rice, cilantro, onion, and I added the most amazing avocado salsa on top. Seriously if you're not drooling yet and driving to Tacos Toro Negro or placing an order, you're missing out. Definitely my new favorite spot for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and back it up as a local place (sadly too many restaursnts have been through this same building and failed). Unfortunately im really struggling with a 2 or 3 star rating. They seemed unprepared with running out of meats, lack of utensils, and very unbalanced price points(the prices have gone up on many of the items you see online). I hate to do this but theres more cons than pros.
Pros:
- carne asada, pollo asado, and chicharon was good.
- tacos are $1.50 pretty average price
- salsa is really good, its spicy but not too spicy
- small menu(makes it easy to order)
- fresh handmade tortillas

Cons:
- they were out of Al Pastor meat!!!(come on its one of the main meats at mexican fast foods next to Asada)
- the chile verde and chile rojo is carne asada in red and chile sauce!!! DUDE.....
- some prices are outrageous expensive. $10 for a. Chimichanga enchilada style. Seems really pricey for a small and new joint
- theres no guacomole here
- very slow cooking(i appreciate its fresh but man takes a while)
- $3 for a side of rice not good
- chimichanga states side of rice and beans(according to them it goes inside however another person ordered t and had rice and beana on the side)

I personally wouldnt come back. And really can't recommend it. I wanted to be a Yelper who could come and backup a new place and let it be successful. Sadly i wont be that person

...well mayb on a groupon or something like that i might try but not full price."}
{"text":"Really bad service looked like the cashier server did not wanna be there. Tacos came out really fast which mean the food is not fresh my steak tacos were a lil bland as well as the pastor only thing that made it taste better was some salsa and lime. Place is not bad  the prices were cheap but you know what they say you get what you pay for seems like a step above filibertos"}
{"text":"Street tacos were amazing and the pictures of the corn tortillas really don't do them justice, amazing and fresh"}
{"text":"A new taco spot for me! Toro Negro has been there a little over a year and I live down the road and it's so easy to drive by and miss it. Well, im glad i decided to stop in! I love these little spots, they almost always serve the best food and it was not a disappointment! They serve more than just tacos.. enchiladas, quesa, chimichangas, etc.  Since it was Tuesday and well, Taco Tuesday, I went with pollo abodabo with rice and beans. The flavour was so good and I love that the verde sauce was a little spicy. Usually it's so mild elsewhere, I enjoyed that kick. Tuesday's and Wednesdays, for single tacos, are 99c. Regular is 1.50. I will definitely be back for sure and try more on the menu! They said hopefully alcohol, like margaritas and beer will be added to the menu. Score!"}
{"text":"I have to give them one star based on my last order. I have never had a complain about the food because it has been great! My one star is due to the fact that I've ordered my food to be delivered. After a while of waiting and a confirmation that my order had been received and charged, I got and e-mail saying that my order had been cancelled. They gave me a number to call and when I did they told me the reason was that the restaurant wasn't taking any orders!!! Then why the confirmation and charge to my account? We did not only had to order from some where else, wait for the food to be delivered and also the money to be refunded (3 to 5 days). Why give confirmation if they are not taking any orders?? They did give me a 5.00 coupon for next time but still not cool!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Taqueria Toro Negro, it is a great family owned and operated business. The service was super fast, super fresh, and they were even able to cater to my two vegetarians. Our crew of 6 will definitely return to enjoy this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in years. Home made tortillas, green chile and pastor were so good. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We order take out from here all the time. The food never disappoints. The salsa is GOOD too! The red is hot af though!"}
{"text":"Great little family run taqueria plus more! Try it out! They are very friendly and no worries if you don't speak Spanish you can just point to the picture of what you want or simply ask the bilingual kids ;)

They serve up there tacos on handmade tortillas and have select aguas frescas (or what I like to call Mexican Kool-aid hehehe (^_^.)

I tried the pollo adobado and asada soft tacos and the highlight of the show was definitely the tortilla. The rest of the fixings and meat flavor were average.

IMO TNT (Toro Negro Taqueria) gets a solid 3/5 right now due to freshness of ingredients.

Next time I go we'll see if there's anything on the menu that blows my mind. !!!***BOOM!!!!***"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in after living a couple blocks from this gem. Been there twice now and the Tacos el pastor are my favorite. Nice family that runs the place and is always clean."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on Father's Day. Everything was great. This is a family run business so the people were awesome. Why in the world would you eat at some lousy fast food joint when you can heat here? We'll defiantly eat here more often. A great find!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Plato's de sopes y convinscion. Love this place, machas gracias Hnos Rodr√≠guez por sus finas atenciones. God Bless tacos Toro Negro."}
{"text":"03/21/2018 around 6:30pm  I went to this place, we were in the middle of making my ordered to go, the ugly guy with very ugly big eyes answered a phone call and took forever to finish my order, when he finally took my order of 7 tacos al pastor, he was trying to change me $2.00,  when in the menu said $1.50, so I asked... why is it almost $16.00 if in the menu says $1.50? Well... they have another little menu with a different price, I don't  care if the tacos were $3.00 each but I don't like to be tricked, so I asked for my card back and he acted rude with nice words like thank you for coming while he throw my card at me!! I am never coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Straight-up the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. 10 notches above the typical Phoenix \"Bertos\" burrito. Can't believe I've never been here before! Friendly staff, amazing salsa, and a truly talented woman making the food. You must try this place! By the way, we sort of just custom build our burritos based upon what we liked, not just from the menu. Burrito was the size of my forearm and I still finished it easy."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Couldn't ask for anything more! Had Al Pastor tacos and Pi√±a Fresca drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic little shop with tasty food. The outside is very unassuming, and the inside is small, but don't let that fool you. The owner is incredibly kind and was very patient while we decided what to order. She cooked all of the food by herself, but it didn't take long. The ingredients are fresh, tortillas are homemade and DELICIOUS. Portions are large, so I have no problem paying $8-$9 for a burrito. My husband finished his entire Chimichanga in less than 10 minutes. We live about 40 minutes away but we will definitely be making the trip back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Hasn't let me down yet. Tacos are good. Food is fresh. Has a nice family running it very friendly. Kind of small place but it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was ok a little bland not so much flavor like they made out to be. Over all nice people and clean restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this Family owned restaurant has fallen a few stars because the taste of the food has degraded somewhat and they never have AGUA FRESCA!! I'm sorry to say that if they continue this route, this will be another restaurant that will fail, butI hope they don't."}
{"text":"Worst tacos ever.  The tortilla was so stiff and dry.  Tough meat, so hard to eat.  I like a good taco. This place is not it.  Very clean, but it does not justify the lack of flavor.  No guacamole or salsa options.  The chimichanga is like a roll of nothing."}
{"text":"My dad loves to eat here, and he always brings me the carne asada burrito! It's delicious and savory! It has a bit of everything with good seasoning and savory meat! The staff is nice and I will for sure be coming back to try more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place but it was just OK. I ordered a few carne asada tacos and they were decent, you can't really mess those up. I was unpleasantly surprised that the tacos(street taco size) only came with one tortilla. So needless to say, my tacos fell apart quickly. 

I also didn't really like the service. I wasn't welcomed in, I greeted the cashier when I walked in. She was sitting at a booth watching TV btw. I felt like i was keeping her from watching her show and I was just picking up a take out order, still felt like I was interrupting. It wasn't a language barrier excise either, she spoke perfect English. Anyway, it's decent just nothing to write home about. You decide."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Thanks for the recommendation, yelp! The al pastor and pollo adobado tacos were excellent, tortillas made on the spot! The carne asada chimichanga was huge and delicious. The salsa verde was sweet and tangy, a perfect complement to the well seasoned meat. Long story short, great stop for a fast lunch!"}
{"text":"We had carne asada tacos and a chicken adobada empanada with rice. Everything was fresh and delicious. The tacos are on the smaller side but we ate everything up ! The place was clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I can't lie, as I realized they were closing soon I lowered my expectations. We placed a fairly large order of Carneasada fries, flautas, and a plate of fish and shrimp with rice and beans....raced over to pick it up and my order was ready to go. Immediately I smell the fish and think I might be onto something! Customer service was great they even allowed me to use my 10% discount from Yelp. Now let me just say at first we ordered with our eyes but I'm so happy we did. I'm overly excited to say it was the bomb! Everything especially the fish and shrimp, great flavors. I could really tell in the food they cared and for that I thank them! Try it out I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Took my mom to lunch here and the tacos were delicious. So much flavor and just enough spice. 

We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I just got a coupon off the grocery store receipt at Fry's on 67th Avenue and Bethany Home for Tacos Toro Negro. I went and just ate the best chimichanga in Arizona at this place. If there was a six stars, they would be getting it."}
{"text":"This is the first Mexican restaurant that has real homemade food. From homemade beans to tortillas! I love it!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for spicy Mexican food, this is not the place. The salsa, beans and rice are very bland. The enchiladas, both cheese and chicken, were good. The waitress was friendly and efficient. Will try again, possibly breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Whoa... what a jewel. Seriously, the Asada Torte was succulent, flavorful and juicy. First time here and my son and I really liked it. Staff was friendly menu was in Spanish and English. Lots of choices and it was cooked fresh. The tacos where delicious and the green avacado sauce was mild, but the red sauce... oh my lips were burning. But damn I kept pouring it on lol so that should tell you. So for a medium horchata, a torte and 4 tacos we paid 18.70. And it was bomb.... yep we will be back! Yuuummm"}
{"text":"Really awesome tacos! The tortillas are hand made which makes them more them better. Also the best horchata ive has in a while.
The guy that took my order had excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Pretty good food... employees were friendly and I enjoyed my lunch. I had the bean and cheese burro and the rolled tacos. Horchata wasn't bad either. Overall I will be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Ok this was great. Came for lunch but had the Chilaquiles. These were great flavor and great portion.  Also ordered a chicken taco. Huge on flavor with it. 

Do not just pass this gem by."}
{"text":"Delicious, AUTHENTIC, fresh, food! Clean place & friendly service. Did I mention the food is absolutely delicious???!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've stopped by on multiple occasions. I love their tacos. I've tried their asada, al pastor and chicharron. Never disappointed! Yes, they are  small but full of flavor. It reminds me of those years I spent living in Mexico. They are truly authentic, which is rare, finding in any restaurant. I'll definitely return and certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend and had to come back today with my boyfriend. We both agree best tacos we have came across here in Phoenix so far. Definitely my new favorite taco spot and I love that it's not even 5 minutes from my house. We'll definitely be back and soon."}
{"text":"Just ate here 5 min ago, BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO on the planet. They grill the tortilla or something and the eggs were good and I usually don't like eggs, just in it for the protein, and the potatoes were amazing and the cheese was super melty. The lady/cook made me feel like my mom was making me food, this place is legit."}
{"text":"I searched my area early to try and find a new spot I hadn't been to. This popped up within 3 miles so I thought I'd give them a shot. 

As I parked, I checked-in and found they offer 10% off a purchase of $5 or more. Since I like to support small businesses, I passed on asking for the discount. 

When I walked in, everything was clean. There was hardly anyone in the location but it was the middle of rush hour so I'm guessing that had a lot to do with it. 

The cashier greeted me, and answered my questions. I ordered a Chicken Taco combo. It came with three tacos, rice, beans and almost a whole lime. I took it to go and ate at home. I wasn't a fan of their rice but I'm super picky so, I would say it was average. The tacos were not only delicious but the meat was moist. The refried beans had yummy cheese innit and it was creamy. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight and had an awesome dinner with my wife. The meal was perfect, small family owned taco shop with great food, we will be back..."}
{"text":"I want to smack myself for passing by this place for the last couple years and finally went tonight.Yoooooo straight up this taqueria just gained a new regular I walked in and knew it was gonna be homemade Mexican food soon as I seen the two ladies in the kitchen it was like my nana or tia making me food.Me and my family had 4 different dishes and each was bomb so I'm pretty sure anything you try here is gonna be good.Homemade corn tortillas on the spot can't beat it"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. If you want authentic mexican this is it. The Pastor is spot on. So oooo good!"}
