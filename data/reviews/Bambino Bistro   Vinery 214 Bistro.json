{"text":"I'm giving this joint one star only because I cannot give it zero.  Since they have been open I have visited this restaurant twice.  The first time, I had a pretty awful experience on the first night of their \"soft opening\".  I wouldn't consider counting it against them as Chef Leonard clearly did not have it together at that point.  Totally forgivable.

It is not that initial experience on which I base my rating, and this review.  

My father has visited Vinery 214/Bambino Bistro on a semi-frequent basis, and he has nothing but complaints about the service.  He gets a laugh out of it and has been wiling to give Leonard a chance time and again.  When he suggested we go for lunch earlier today, I played along, as it is close to where I live and I was hungry.

We ordered inside, two paninis and two iced teas, and grabbed a table on the small patio, which has to be one of the best outdoor dining areas in downtown phoenix.  Our food was out in less than fifteen minutes, as promised.  Leonard had to go back inside for our iced teas, which was a minor inconvenience that I am willing to forgive.  He had to go back again to get us the napkins we asked for.  Before picking up my oil-soaked panini sandwich I waited while he rolled two linens with silverware and casually chatted with the other cook inside.  By the time we were all prepped to eat, I had done enough staring at my sandwich to lose my appetite.

I ordered the panini with mozzarella, basil pesto and garlic aoli.  What I got was nothing of the sort.  There was certainly basil pesto, fresh greens, tomato and balsamic vinegar but the cheese appeared to be a blend of cheddar, what tasted like jack and maybe mozzarella.  I ate half the sandwich anyway and it was horrible.  When \"Celebrity Chef Leonard Jay\" came out to ask us about our meal, I told him it was not satisfactory, nor what I ordered.  

I complained about the cheese not being mozzarella and he made some big spiel about \"quattro formaggi\" that he uses on everything.  He seemed totally disinterested in my complaint about the meal not being what I ordered (one would expect a mozzarella panini to have some sliced mozzarella on it, no?).  Leonard even had the audacity to bring me a cup of his special shredded cheese mix and openly challenge my criticism of his food.  He took my critique of his food personally, which is understandable for anyone who takes pride in their work.  However, I do not believe he is making quality product and he needs to know that.

If I had sat around any longer, I would have completely lost my cool on this guy.  The man's ego exceeds not only his culinary abilities but also his prowess as a restauranteur.  \"Celebrity Chef\" Leonard Jay is a joke.  Anyone wiling to treat their customers like I was treated in his restaurant should not be in this business.

No matter how difficult a customer is with me when I am serving them I always swallow my pride and concede any sort of argument.  I work in the service industry and it is my personal goal to never lose a customer when I can do something about it.  That is why it is called the \"service industry\".

I will never return to this establishment as long as Leonard Jay is in charge.  This place is a prime spot and, when Bambino Bistro finally comes to its impending end, I hope the next person to open a restaurant there does a much better job.  The place is already set up for what could be an excellent little downtown cafe.  I am certainly looking forward to it."}

{"text":"I had a lunch meeting at Bambino Bistro today and was pleasantly surprised by the crowd dining both in and outdoors when I arrived.  Though it was not well marked, I did figure out the location based on the address...

We waited what seemed like a really long time to get water and to order... this place is a two man operation.  It was just Chef/Owner/Manager Leonard and one other employee when we were there.

The service was far from attentive but the food was enjoyable once it arrived.  I had the Greek salad.  The others at my table  enjoyed their sandwiches once they figured out which was which.  (They mixed up the two of them and served them backwards).  The fresh bread was a treat and the hummus was an odd texture, but it was tasty.  

Would I rush back to Bambino?  Probably not.  And I definitely would not go if I were in a rush.  But if I felt like a Greek salad, a panini sandwich, or fresh bread and was not in any kind of a hurry, I would give it another shot."}
