{"text":"Four stars for the value! Hands down the cheapest place for a satisfying meal in sauga. Huge portions, passable taste, skimpy on the cutlery and napkins, but who can blame them? Their margins are probably pretty low considering their pricing.   Singaporean Vermicelli - pretty good! Huuuuuuuge portions and the seasoning was there (4/5)  Pork chops with fried rice - the chops were average and the fried rice was tasteless, maybe order something else (2/5)  Both came up to 16 bucks and fed 4 people... with leftovers.  Come here if you're broke and want enough food for 2+ meals. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My fav place in the Dixie park centre food court! Sea star never disappoints! Always fresh and flavourful! When I get a craving I usually get my all time fav - grilled chicken (Korean style) on top of fried rice...$9 including tax. It tastes like Korean BBQ mmmm. They serve Large portions, meals are fresh to order and delicious. The pad Thai is also great (although not authentic) it is still a very nice noodle dish with pineapple pieces, the spicy fried pork chops are also great and the lemon chicken cutlets are good too! Sea star caters as well and their prices (for what you get) are pretty good value as well! Ps it gets busy at lunch time so call in advance And your meal is usually ready in 10 mins. PPS they only take cash!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafeteria places to eat at. Sea Star easily tops many. My favorite dishes are the Chicken/Shrimp with Cream/Tomato sauce. And the Portuguese style Spaghetti. Also the Baked Seafood is really good too."}
{"text":"Haven't really tried a lotta things here but my go to is Ying Yang sauce on chicken steak with spaghetti. YY is half cream and half tomato sauce. The sauces aren't made like western style cream or tomato, it's more Asian styled and tastes bit more sweet. There is an option to get pork chops but I'm not a fan of pork so I always get chicken steak. They use chicken breast pieces here and it's not too heavy on fried batter (that's why I like it, more meat less batter). On top they add a few pieces of grilled and steamed vegetables ie beans carrots and corns. The spaghetti is cooked like normal. This is my go to dish here. I know a few people that get the bolognese spaghetti and they rave about it. I guess spaghetti dishes are decent here? Haha. Dixie park is pretty much the cheap alternative for dining on a budget and it's super fas service as well."}
