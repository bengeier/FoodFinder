{"text":"Love this place. Best deli in the city and one of the best sandwich shops as well. Sandwiches are incredibly fresh and are huge. By far the best hot sausage sandwich around."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I wish I didn't live so far away!  The food from this deli was delicious and the family running the business was very friendly!  I will be sure to visit here the next time I make it out to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever!  Stacked a mile high and very reasonable prices.  Very friendly family that runs it.  I have introduced all my friends family to this place it's that good!  I absolutely love the anti pasta salad also it is amazing!  It's always a great experience."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches at amazingly great prices!  The man who owns this is super nice and so helpful!  One sandwich feeds 2 adults and will fill both of you up.  The closest thing to a New York Deli in this area.  Go in here once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Probably the best traditional sandwich shop in the city.  Great prices, fresh meats and condiments.  My good friend turned me on to the place a while back and the folks who run and own the place are very friendly.  Carl made me a special - hot capicola, provolone, fried egg, coleslaw and mayo on chewy Italian bread.  Outstanding.  It was of considerable heft, I have to add.  My buddy had a Reuben and an Italian hot sausage sandwich.  Truly epic sandwiches.  His son helps on the counter too - 3rd generation business.  Please go!"}
{"text":"The hot sausage is the best I think I've ever had...I know that is a very bold statement, but I stand behind it ;-)  This place has been in the same location for like 30 years, so they're doing something right (and with no advertising!).  Love the sidewalk stand-great if you don't have a lot of time for lunch (& you can pay outside). My only suggestion would be for them to sell extra sauce (extra .50, maybe) with the hot sausage.  Otherwise, this spot is awesome & the people are super friendly :-)"}
{"text":"Finally stopped into NSD this morning to see if they'd make me a lunch sandwich.  DELICIOUS!  I got the Madison, which is the corned beef sandwich.  And on Breakworks rye bread.  Can't beat this sandwich."}
{"text":"First time customer today.  It is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great.  Large portions, fresh bread and cheap..."}
{"text":"What a great price $6.85 for a 12 inch hoagie!! No shortage of beef on this sandwich!   Here in the burg you can get Steak hoagies just about anywhere.   This is one of my favorite staple hoagies..  This may not have been the \"best\" but it was up there - nice solid sandwich.  The bread was fresh too.    Thank you North Shore Deli !!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches.  Everything is made to older on fresh bread. Staff friendly. Good value. Hidden gem"}
{"text":"Such a great deli. The food is fresh and delicious. The portions are plentiful. The service is always with a smile. They have an outdoor grill serving hot dogs and sausages. The aroma makes you hungry as you walk by!  I've had several of their different sandwiches. My favorite? The turkey sandwich and their braunschweiger!   Don't pass this place by!"}
{"text":"The Madison is awesome! All sandwiches are good. Kind of like the soup Nazi of sandwiches. Order, get out of the way, wait, pay and get out."}
{"text":"Love the North Shore deli! Sandwiches are huge, fresh meat, soft bread and they are not light handed with the meat! With this being down the street from a subway, you're cheating yourself by going to subway and not coming here. My favorite is the federal street on rye!   Keep in mind there's not room to eat in! Lunch time it's packed for a good reason -because it's delicious and priced very well."}
{"text":"I didn't want to review because it's my favorite sandwich shop and I don't want it to get crowded. I think it's the best sandwich in Pittsburgh. Sometimes there is a 15-20 minutes wait but it's worth it. I've also been there and it's been no wait. I have loved everything I've ordered. No negatives in my book."}
{"text":"I somehow discovered this place when searching for sandwich places to enjoy with a friend.  How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer!  Please note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me, you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).    It was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.    When I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was, my friends.  Exploding with flavor, that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.  I guarantee you, this is only the first of many visits."}
{"text":"Possibly the biggest deli sandwich I've ever had and it was only $7. Not much, if any, room to eat inside but great to go."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches.  Huge portions, great ingredients all very fresh.  Joe & Dolly's sandwich shop is a classic.  I suggest the Corned Beef, Roast Beef or Pastrami.  Inexpensive and quick.  Great for lunch."}
{"text":"I prefer the South Shore Deli and by Deli I mean your girlfriend's oh crap is that the time.  Speaking of times. They say they are open until 3.30, but were closed at 2.45. Annoying.  When I did get to try it, it was more expensive than I expected (but still relatively average) and just ok (didn't blow me away like, for example, Frank's Bratwurst in rival city Cleveland's East Side Market - market down in your diaries as a place you must try).  I'd heard that this was a Pittsburgh specialty and had been attempting to try it for a long time. When I finally did I was delighted for the chance to experience it, but a little underwhelmed. The sausages taste good, don't get me wrong. And it's heavy and filling. On the other hand is not the most amazing sausage I've had by a long shot and it's a little pricey considering what you actually get. This is an institution of Pittsburgh and of the Northside but perhaps they should Branch out and get some even tastier sausages because I think I would enjoy the experience even more if they had something really spectacular such as your uncle's sausage. But don't tell your auntie that I said that"}
{"text":"Wife picked up some sandwiches for us from the North Shore Deli. Wife actually brought back sandwiches 2x from there. I had lean pastrami on rye with mustard. North shore had Boars Head meats which are my favorite. The sandwich was amazing and I would definetly recommend North Shore Deli. I will definitely be going there my self at some point as the food is amazing. Once I go there my self I will update my listing"}
{"text":"5stars for what it is...  Great sandwiches, amazing qual/quantity for the price, and good hometown friendly service.   Each sandwich (named after Pgh streets) is freshly prepared. They slice the meat immediately after you order so you may have a short wait. Pickle spears come w/ each sandwich. The sandwiches are large, so go hungry and don't worry about breaking the bank  ($6-$7 avg.)."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I've been here a handful of times, and it has consistently delicious sandwiches. I've had the Madison- corned beef, coleslaw, swiss and 3 slices of bread as well as the Federal- turkey, lettuce, tomato, onion, swiss on rye. There are about 20 different sandwiches to try, so no shortage of options. Also- the potato salad is tasty, great for a summer day. The staff is friendly and it's small inside. You order, they make it and you're good to go."}
{"text":"Friendly father and son working when I came in. Excellent capicola on an Italian roll. Very fresh ingredients. Fast service."}
{"text":"first time here and was SO GOOD. service was super quick, sandwich was delicious, and got a side of mac salad, a pickle, and a sandwich the side of my head for $8.  great and very delicious deal"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches... The Madison St. is my quintessential go-to when nothing else will do.  This place truly classifies as a dive or hole in the wall but once you have a sandwich here you will bring your friends back again and again.  the hot sausage is incredible too."}
{"text":"Everyone is on the money about this place. It is cheap, friendly and fucking phenomenal. The hot dog cart outside ain't bad neither. Get yourself an AGH, one hot and one cold, and see what all the fuss is about."}
