{"text":"I dropped by Madison's for a late dinner before going out this past week.  The restaurant was split into two sections - one with a traditional bar feel (much louder and starting to get busier as the evening progressed) and the other with more of a traditional restaurant feel to it.  I choose to sit on the quieter, restaurant half.  The service was good - attentive and friendly.  They had a good beer selection including my favorite - Bells, so no complaints on that front.  For dinner I ordered the turkey pesto sandwich and my friend got the mac and cheese.  We both ordered sweet potato tots.  The food was better than expected given some of the prior reviews I had read and the tots were excellent.  I love pesto and melted goat cheese added the perfect touch.  The mac and cheese - made with local Hook's cheese -  was also very good."}
{"text":"We stopped by Madison's for drinks after dinner and were in shock at how crowded the venue was. By nine thirty they had already brought out a dj and the dance floor was fairly crowded. In terms of drinks, my friend ordered a whiskey sour which ended up being made with Fireball. Not sure if it was intentional or the house recipe, but it definitely surprised my friend. Overall, it was a fun time, but I would definitely not recommend it if you are looking for a quieter night."}
{"text":"First of all, I personally know from experience in this restaurant that they DO NOT use gloves when they expedite their food. Meaning I have personally seen servers go smoke a cigarette, come back in, and handle customers food WITHOUT washing their hands. NASTY. Sure, their food seems of good quality but you would have better luck at McDonalds. The only thing worth while at this place is the interesting and pretty drinks they make. Other than that the only time I have seen them wear gloves is when the Food Inspector came and they were all in a panic. Also their food is so over priced, that artichoke dip is poor quality crap at high price. That is all I need to say, they are unsanitary. The people at this institution are superficial as well. I have nothing good to say and they deceive many."}
{"text":"If you love bloody marys....come here! You get cheese curds and a beef stick with it. Made with bacon vodka. Bartenders are amazing. Mark, a bartender here was so friendly, informative and really made us feel like we were part of their family.   Food was great and very nice atmosphere.  Lots of windows and tons of options for liquor. If you are looking for a good place in Madison.  Come here."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch bottomless mimosas. Also happened to get the breakfast burrito which is probably the best one in Madison. The salsa was good the food was good the mimosa's were great."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the meal. The marinara goat cheese appetizer was great. The alcohol is very overpriced.  I bought the cheapest bottle of pinot noir and it still cost more than the meal. The building itself it full of character but unfortunately they have televisions EVERYWHERE on every single wall. That was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We came here to get a drink while waiting for a table somewhere else, but once we all got a drink we enjoyed them so much we ordered a few appetizers while we wait. The corn on the cob and the cheese curds were absolutely amazing which led to use canceling our reservation at the nicer restaurant to eat dinner here and it was the best choice we could've made! Drinks were a little pricey, but all super unique combinations made with great ingredients. All food dishes we ordered exceeded expectations I will DEFINITELY be returning here again soon"}
{"text":"I went here for an event held by Goose Island during the Great Taste weekend. Free beers for a couple hours. Needless to say it was extremely crowded. The interior set up seemed silly, intentionally wasting space. The music was loud and annoying. Overall, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious. Saturday brunch was fabulous! Loved the biscuits & gravy, biscuits were so yummy the waitress even said they were made that morning. You could taste the freshness, they were grandma style biscuits. We also liked brisket breakfast. Really got us with the 6 Bloody Mary's. I love how Madison's does their own inhouse pickling. Our waitress gave us the whole downlow on how fresh everything is. We will be back as usual, well as long as you have those great fluffy biscuits :)"}
{"text":"I love Madison's!! Their food is amazing during lunch time if you're ever downtown. The night scene is awesome. There's a lot of space and have great music and a great vibe. Love!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are quite expensive.  The cheese curds were greasy.  I had fish tacos they were good however another in our party ordered them and was shorted fish.  The rice was hard that was served with the fish.  Their claim to many tater tot sides seemed to be ordinary Oreida brand and very salty.  For a 80 dollars dinner and drinks I felt we were let down.  Will not return.  The waitress was pleasant. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Upscale interior, good music, great service, and $2 happy hour after work. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"My four stars are for the bar, as I've never eaten there (except free apps at a happy hour event). I appreciate this bar because it's not all undergrads, they have quite a good variety of cocktails, and even have some enthusiastic dancers, although I'm usually not one of those. They also have decent TV's so I can keep an eye on any sports games, but don't have to sacrifice a Saturday night to do so. I've always gotten good service at the bar, but I do usually come with regulars. It's sorta dressy, for ladies at least nice jeans and heels, for guys a collared shirt. The downstairs dance floor is a little cramped, but I think very well-received. The DJ is a really nice guy, but could use a little more indie rock/underground hip hop and a little less top 40 pop to suit me. And the ladies' bathrooms need a little TLC, now that they get such increased use with all the dancing downstairs."}
{"text":"The service was top notch.  Everyone was extremely nice and attentive.  We just had an appetizer and drinks but it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Wish I found this place months ago!!!   Great food, fresh ingredients, nice beer and cocktail options, and pleasant and attentive staff.  Quiet and spacious outdoor seating.  I'll be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful old building with great food and excellent cocktail menu. Fish fry on a Friday was just right. Cocktail prices on the high side, but a decent beer menu. Wait staff was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I used to love going to this place.  I would go every weekend when I had the time.  Lately though the crowd has definitely changed.  I do like how they switched the dance area from downstairs, where it always started to really smell bad.  My complaint is still with the layout though.  Thankfully the dance area isn't downstairs anymore so you don't have to have a log jam of people trying to go to the bathroom accessible by only 1 staircase mixed with all the people going into the dance area.  Now though the new dance area is right by the entrance so that also gets very crowded.  It can take awhile to get a drink at the bar and you are much better off being in the dance area and have an actual server get your drinks for you.  Not bad prices though when you do actually get a drink."}
{"text":"Very good food. Arrived hot and on time. The house burger was excellent and the bacon brussels as a side were a great change of pace."}
{"text":"Go there to grab a drink but skip the food, much better choices to feed yourself in the area. I you think of Madison's as a bar you'll be fine: friendly staff, good choices of beer on tap, plenty of TVs to watch local sports."}
{"text":"This place is a little snazzier than some of the other gin joints in the area, and they specialized in cocktails and infused drinks.  The beer drinkers in the group weren't as happy as the cocktalians, but the service was good, the prices were right and I was pretty happy with drinks.  I could have lived without the big screen TVs, but I guess that's not going to happen in a college town."}
{"text":"I don't want to waste my time on an extensive review of this shithole, so I'll just give a few \"highlights\" of my evening I wasted there: 1. Bartender was a rude biddy, talking down to my husband because he made a mistake about their Craft Beer Week specials.  2. Sat at a table at the bar and was not approached by any of the seemingly wandering waitstaff, so only had one beer when we would have ordered more. 3. Father in law was wearing a hat like Curious George's keeper would wear, read, a fedora. An employee of the bar came to our table (at 10:05 pm) and told him that they have a dress code, so he would need to take it off. A., he's in his fifties, B., I don't recall ever hearing of a gang that uses fedoras as their identifier and C., give me a freaking break. It's MADISON WISCONSIN.  4. Now for the best part of the evening: I attempted to leave through the back door that I had seen scores of people leaving through for the past hour we were in the bar. I was accosted by their bouncer, who was a roid-raging, shaved head asshole. Literally accosted- he grabbed me by my arm and tried to bodily yank me back through the door. I pulled away from him, and he then turned his blind rage on my husband, who had followed me not realizing what was happening. He grabbed my husband then, as I had made it outside to safety, twisted his arm behind him, threw him up against a wall, and started screaming in his face. He then threw my husband to the side to physically bar my, again, 50-something in-laws from leaving. I came back inside to call him on his roid rage, which he didn't like, because he had to be held back by his managers from coming after me to... not verbally assault me, surely, because he seemed to have the intellect of Kris Humphries, so I can only assume he was going to grab me again.  We tried to talk sense into the staff. It was like talking to a brick wall, so after a few choice words on my part, we left.  This place sucks. Avoid it. Hope they fired that dickhead bouncer."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but they have upped the ante.  Great drink menu, creative food options.  Good for big groups.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Bathrooms are disgusting and smells like a port o potty. Sometimes their music is garbage depending on the DJ I guess. Bartenders are awesome and the bouncers are nice. Drinks are priced nicely. If you want to dance with your friends on a Saturday night, if the music is right, I would recommend coming here. They always have 2 other rooms that are pretty low key if you don't want to deal with the crowd on the main level."}
{"text":"It's partly my own fault. I saw \"Prosciutto Panino\" on the  menu and somehow twisted that into \"Portabello\" in my head.  My judgement was also clouded by hunger as I desperately declared this spot \"totally fine!\" and we ventured inside for dinner.   Once we sat down and I remembered how to read, I realized there was not one vegetarian entree on the menu.  Mildly surprised, I turned to the sandwich section, confident I'd find something there... nope, not even a vegetable sandwich to be found.  SALADS!  Salads MUST be safe!  I skimmed the three options, finding chicken, steak, or shrimp on each one.  Things were looking grim.  My options were now narrowed down to several appetizers.  Cheese curds and hummus weren't striking my fancy for dinner so I asked our server if it was possible to substitute the meat on a sandwich for extra veggies instead?  She checked and said yes, so I ordered the Turkey Pesto sandwich, hold the turkey add the veggies.  What I got was basically the Turkey sandwich, less the turkey.  Making it a rather expensive bread/pesto/spinach/onion sandwich.    BOTTOM LINE:  I think it's safe to say I won't be returning somewhere where I don't even have one dinner option to choose from.  Besides that, the staff was fine (although a server who would recognize and advise the kitchen that a few pieces of spinach and bread does not a sandwich make would be appreciated...)."}
{"text":"Exactly the kind of vibe I look for at the end of a work travel week. Pretty chill. Good food if you want dinner, and better cocktails to forget the stress of the week. Nicely populated by locals for color, but not too busy. You can still carry a conversation if your inclined."}
{"text":"One of the best non-college sports bars in Madison. I like this place quite a bit as it has a great atmosphere, great food, moderately priced drinks and fantastic DJ on Saturday nights. I came here to watch the Stanley Cup playoffs and had a blast with a party of 12 of which they were extremely accommodating. Definitely come here when you are feeling a little more mature than the typcial Madison college bar.  A little later in the evening the crowd gets a little more upscale, well at least for Madison, and then the entertainment really kicks up."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Decent appetizers.  Main courses were mediocre."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I came here for dinner after already having a few drinks on a Friday night (Happy Hour can get ya, right?). Anyway, I was craving a fish fry and after stopping to see that the fish fry at Merchant was outrageously expensive ($16) we stopped by Madison's to check out the prices. And we were happily surprised! The fish fry at Madison's is only about $8 for two large pieces, and a couple dollars more for all you can eat. What a steal!   I ordered the fish fry of course and a Blackberry Pear Crispin. The food was so yummy! The breading was thin enough so you could still taste the fish, and it was not greasy at all. Only complaint was that the breading tended to fall off of the fish, not as bad as some other places I've had it but still a nuisance. I didn't care for the coleslaw, I'm a big fan of really vinegar-y coleslaws and this one was a little too creamy for my taste. As a side, I ordered the sweet potato tater tots and they were very good. Maybe a little on the cold side but still tasty.   My friend ordered the ahi tuna salad, which I've had before and really enjoyed it. The ahi tuna steak was cooked perfectly.   Service was also great and fast! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best \"breakfast shots\" in town! Jameson whiskey topped off with butterscotch schnapps and chased with a shot of fresh orange juice. Thank you Madison's!"}
{"text":"Came here for the music, live jazz (at a bar w/ sports and club she upstairs- should have guessed??!). Although the place is not my usual vibe at all, I was pleasantly surprised! The blackened Salmon 'burger' was great, side of gardinera was a bit sparse but refreshing and complimented the mango chutney topping well. Although the drink list downstairs was small, it was quality, as was all of the staff. Bartenders and waitresses were speedy, attentive and very friendly. I have nothing bad to say, I only give a 4 because I felt the food menu was somewhat limited for non/ fried apps. I would have liked some veggie options for the entree. More seating in the jazz are would be a plus. It was somewhat sparse. Overall it was a nice experience! Go!"}
{"text":"Madison's has some of my favorite fish tacos in Madison (I'm from San Diego, so that's saying a lot).  To be honest, I've only had a couple things off their menu (mostly from the happy hour section), but the fish tacos are always a win. They use cabbage (which is HUGE for me, I don't do lettuce on fish tacos), and their sauce is a remoulade (as supposed to a chile-lime-cilantro crema, but it's still delicious). Topped with pickled onions, it's a little spin that works."}
{"text":"I will be coming back two or three times a year.   Madison's was a nice place for brunch and mimosas today. We got a full row of bar stools and noticed our drinks being refilled faster than the drinks of those sitting at tables. Hehhehhehhh, chumps! Also, at only $10 per person, the mimosa deal at Madison's can give an enthusiastic bruncher quite a good booze:buck ratio. One note though, you a required to order some food to activate mimosas - chips and a brisket taco for $4 will suffice.  The atmosphere was great! Nice people, nice light, not crowded, but plenty of souls in the joint laughing and sharing good times."}
{"text":"This bar does a lot of things. It serves decent comfort food, high end cocktails, does sports, lots of different genres of music over the weekends in an upper and lower bar. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! Really enjoyed my experience at Madison's. Food was great, service was even better! Lovely evening out on the patio, what a beautiful area of town. Our server was Kat and she was amazing, they need to pay her whatever they can to keep her around, let me tell ya! Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food but not worth the hour + wait to get it. Hostess didn't seem to know what she was doing and the kitchen was incredibly slow. Great drinks and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Came here for food and to watch a world cup game. The TV's are great for games, and the service from the bar was good. The food, however, was another story. The chicken thigh sandwich was fine, nothing remarkable, but the ahi tuna salad was disgusting. The food is pretty expensive, so if you want to pinch some pennies and still experience the ahi salad, I'd suggest just cramming a fistful of salt in your mouth. It should taste about the same and you'll save about $12."}
{"text":"So you've just had a long week of work, and you want to do nothing but relax. However, you end up going out anyways, because you know your friends won't let you live it down for staying in on a Friday night.   You might start the night off at Chasers, finishing a pitcher... or 4, then head over to Wando's for some fishbowls. Now at this point, all you want is to do some headbanging and dance your ass off.   You decide to go to Madison's, and head immediately to the bar. You get a rum & coke, and fork over a few dollars for tip. Despite being already tipsy at this point, you can still taste too much of the alcohol, which means that the past few dollars were definitely well spent. After downing the drink, you put your game face on and brave the dance floor. They play some top 40 stuff, and you're thinking to yourself, I could make this work. Then, out of nowhere, Gangnam Style starts playing, and before you know it, you're making a complete fool out of yourself at the center of the dance floor. Next thing you know, you wake up in your bed, thankfully entirely clothed. With nothing but Facebook pictures to rely on, you start to piece together the night before.  Now if that doesn't sound like an awesome night, then I don't know what people do for fun these days."}
{"text":"There's just something about Madison's.  I love the downstairs bar and dance floor.  Can't say too much about the upstairs.  I hear there's a lounge and bar.  I probably walk past it every time but it's always been a blur as as I stumble down the stairs to get to the dance floor.  Hated Britney's \"Gimme More\" but for some reason, sounded great when it was blasting at Madison's.  Now that's saying a lot.  Alright, FINE.  I have her whole Blackout album okay?!  Looks like this might be where I am booking my P. Diddy White Party for my 23rd birthday."}
{"text":"So disclaimer, my reviews are based on my experience eating vegan in Madison. Madison's had a nice atmosphere for drinks on a Friday. It seemed like there were good options for sections of the venue to choose from..dance floor area, more private alcove seating past the DJ, bar, downstairs. The lower level was unaccessible the night we were there but piqued my interest. The staff was super friendly. Our server was bubbly and jovial and gave us the perfect amount of attention.   I just couldn't find much to eat unfortunately. And our server didn't have much to offer in the way of suggestions. It was endearing when she told me that the only vegetarian things on the menu were salads and fish. ;) She did check with the cook about the ingredients in the truffle tots when I asked. Came back with a vegan-friendly answer so that's what I ordered. They were delicious! But the salad that I got to go with them wasn't memorable, and a dinner of truffle tots left me feeling pretty logy.   A place where I can count on some interesting food options to go with my drinks would probably get my business next time around."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are not from Madison, there for a concert. We were there on Friday night for a late dinner and drinks. I liked the setting with the big screen tv's, bar, booths, lounge area near the dinning area. Service was prompt and staff was friendly.   I had the streak salad which was a large portion and really good!  He had the all you can eat fish fry and he was happy with his food.. Good import beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Went to Madison's last night.  Had some delicious wings!  The fish tacos were awesome!  Loved them.  Server was awesome. . . Friendly. . . Attentive!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service was definitely 5 star!  Food was great as well / top of the food chain bar food.  We added a few orders of $2 happy hour slider with our dinner which were a tasty great value.  We were a table of 6 and all had different meals, I would of been happy with anyone's plate.  This is the place for me .....lots of sports on TV!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'd been here before for drinks and enjoyed it, and still think it's a fine bar, but for food I would definitely skip. I had without exaggeration one of the worst meals of my life here. First, we ordered the fried cheese curds which looked good with a nice light breading, but were room temperature and rubbery. I ordered the broiled haddock with creamed spinach which was absolutely terrible. My fish was cold and tough and was inexplicably seasoned with something that tasted like barbecue. My fiance ordered the fried haddock which was also tough and chewy along with the macaroni and cheese which was watery and bland. For the prices and atmosphere, I was expecting a decent meal, but I was sorely mistaken."}
{"text":"I thought this was a place to semi-club and drink, but the food isn't necessarily bad either.  By food, I actually mean just their tater tot appetizers. I decided to eat here once and ordered their sweet tots and the smoked gouda burger. The burger was okay, but I devoured the sweet tots. I ended up not finishing the burger and instead ordered both the poutine tots and the truffle tots.   I'm sure most people go to Madison's for drinks and dancing, rather than the food. But if you're hungry and want to drink, at least you can coat your stomach lines with the tater tots beforehand to maximize your experience."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.and go frequently, great steak sandwiches,used to have a super French dip,wonderful appetizers (especially the pot roast sliders) Well some genius decided to shrink the menu and go ala cart , so a mediocre flank steak sandwich didn't even come with fries or any side,fries we're ala cart for $4 Seems like cutting costs is the new philosophy  Well is mine is I won't be back Allot of other great choices in Madison, but NOT  Madison's!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after a nearby brunch spot had an hour wait. I was happy to find that they charged $10 for bottomless mimosas and even happier that our waiter came to refill our glasses several times. Definitely got more than our money's worth. Beyond that, the food was delicious. I was happy with my French toast but would next time order the breakfast burrito my fiancé had. As mentioned, our waiter was very attentive and also really nice. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Madison's is one of my favorite places to get martinis! We stopped here during my sister's Bachelorette Party. It was packed in the main area so our party went to the side room where it was quieter. We ordered 9 strawtinis and the bartender made our martinis with such style! He lined up 9 martini glasses, each drizzled with strawberry glaze, and then poured all 9 martini's at the same time out of 9 different shakers that were stacked on top of each other. I was so impressed that he took the time to do this with it being so crowded - it was so creative and looked like it took so much skill! (check out my photos for a pic.) We absolutely loved it and it's been a high point of the night ever since! Thank you Madison's!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and vibe.  The mixed drinks weren't exactly right.. and when ordering a second, it came prepared differently than the first.  Nice burger selection and helpful staff."}
{"text":"This place is aight, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. The menu isn't terrible and the service is good. It's basically like an upscale sports bar I suppose.   I had the ahi tuna sandwich with seasonal veggies (green beans and red peppers...yum)."}
{"text":"I hit up Madisons every time I visit my hometown (I'm now in Chicago). This spot is a great reprieve from the college vibe of State St. Don't get me wrong, I like getting banged up as much as the next person, but if you're past 25 the downtown scene in Madison is, well, lacking. Madisons is one of the few great spots downtown that helps to fill this void.   The drink selection is awesome and the food is great. Servers are very kind and the bar staff definitely know how to mix a drink. There's a plethora of TVs if you're looking to catch a game, but at the same time you're not in a sports bar.  The location - right off the square - is prime. There's a parking garage across the street and I've left my car there overnight a slew of times with no trouble the next day."}
{"text":"We came here with friends and our total of 5 kids under the age of 5.  The wait for the Great Dane pub was 45 minutes so we came over to Madisons.  It was pretty much empty at 6:30 and at first, they didn't seem to happy to being serving 5 kids but our waitress didn't seem to mind.  The food was good.  The Mac and Cheese is good and the brisket sliders were very good.  We also had the chipotle chicken which was quite good too.  The prices were a bit high but we were overall pleased with the service and quality of food.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I always come here when we're in the mood for a dance-y night. This is our favorite place to go in terms of vibe. You can either sit at the high-tops and hang out on one side of the place, near the bar, or you can head over to the small dance area on the other side if you're up for it. We've been here a few times, and I've experienced both sides. Ultimately, I'd say this is a great place to end the night. The vibe on the sitting side is very nice and cozy, I love the lighting and the feel of being at a high-top. The dance floor is fun, too, in terms of music choice and space. It's never too crowded, so you can always return to your table if you're not feeling it. I took off a star because drinks are a bit pricy and they also don't have a coat check, which is a bummer.  I hate having to leave my parka on the chair but sometimes it's just what you got to do. I would recommend this place for a girls night out, most definitely!   Will be back for happy hour sometime!"}
{"text":"My wife and i were out in Madison visiting my son for the weekend. He took us to Madison's after the football game for dinner. We had been drinking all day, so it was nice to get some good food. Considering it is by the capital area, the prices were reasonable. They are big on the tater tots. The drinks were very good and they have a vast beer selection. I'll have to try it again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The good: The food was excellent.  Really liked the burger, and the bacon was not only cooked to perfection (crispy all the way through but not burnt) but possibly the tastiest bacon I have ever had in my life.  Asparagus side was really good too.  Friendly and attentive staff, reasonable drink prices.  The bad:  Burger was a little pricey - this isn't a gourmet dining place.  Most of all, the music; I was in on a Saturday evening from about 8:30-10:00pm.  If you would have blindfolded me and brought me here, based on the music I would have thought I was at some indie hipster coffee shop.  I don't know who was in charge of the music, but on a Saturday evening leading up to a DJ you need to be playing music that has a little bit of energy to it.  Not this wimpy, soft (as a female friend of mine would say, \"v-g-n- music\") crap.  It doesn't encourage anyone to stick around.  People want to have fun on a Saturday night, so make the music and ambiance fun.  Compare to the music that is playing at Merchant and DLux at the same time.  It's no wonder there are more people there than at Madison's.  It's nice to know I can go here at 9pm and get a seat at the bar.  But that's probably not good for business."}
{"text":"Positives: Great for sports games - their TVs are by far some of the best on the square and unlike the Dane, their set up is actually made to watch games. The actual bar itself as a building is absolutely beautiful. The house-infused alcohol is great and I don't think I've ever had a bad drink here. The few times I've eaten here, the specials were great and fairly priced. The appetizers are fairly good and the staff as a whole is pretty friendly.  Negatives: As a bar at night, Madison's is borderline the worst. I mean if you're into annoying college students who believe they're \"beyond\" campus bars but in reality are the worst, then this the bar for you. It's a really weird vibe of people sometimes - ranging from the college bro to people in their 60's to younger professionals. To continue from my food comment from the positivies, every time I've eaten here and NOT gotten the special, the food was overpriced, underwhelming, and mediocre at best. I had the ahi tuna salad most recently and honestly, it was mouthful after mouthful of salty, terribly seasoned tuna. Even the mandarin oranges were salt-laden. Literally inedible, which I probably wouldn't have been too mad about if I hadn't just paid $12 for food that I couldn't even eat."}
{"text":"Little hipster spot with great wings. Dry rub is excellent and I loved the buffalo side. My french dip was a solid MEH as the giardiniera kep falling out of the sandwich (wasn't crumbled like some giardiniera, it was whole pieces of veggies) and the au jus didn't have any flavor. The side of mac was decent. I would visit for the drink and wing specials and get dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I think Madison's food is highly underrated. They have awesome Friday fish fry! Also I have tried all of their salads and they are quite delicious! Pretty good price point as well. One pro tip is if you go the Madison's during live on king street you can hear all of the music perfectly! Sometimes service is a bit hit or miss. However I generally can count on solid food at Madison's."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about the food, but I do know that Thursday night dueling pianos is a blast- the two guys play the same songs every week, but when you're out with good friends you can sign Piano Man every week at the top of your lungs and have a great time.    Plus, happy hour is certainly worth it- it's hardly ever busy (plus it's such a big place), so there's always somewhere to sit, along with $2 taps and rails- 4-7pm, Monday thru Friday= quite the deal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Madison for our spring break this year. We stumbled upon Madison's on a Tuesday night, as it was chilly and this place was close to our hotel. Although it's a spacious place, it was pretty much empty. We had FABULOUS service from George. He was friendly and attentive, and even gave my husband some local bike shop tips. I had a really great burger and the drinks were strong, but inexpensive.  I obviously am no testament to what this place is like on an evening weekends, but for a laid back, middle-of-the-week dinner and drink, it was perfect."}
{"text":"First time coming here for dinner and we were not impressed at all. Limited dinner menu options and when we asked to substitute the side paired with the burger (which is literally 4 slices of pickles in dressing) we were told we couldn't do that and had to pay $4.00 extra for fries or tatortots. My friend ordered the nachos and was given very very little cheese. When she asked for more cheese, she was given a tiny cup and told it would be an upcharge. When we got the bill, it was $4.00 for a tiny cup of cheese. We were also overcharged for the 3 ice cream cookie sandwich deal and the beer taps weren't working. The waitress was very nice and the staff, but we left filling ripped off for food that wasn't very good. For drinks, it's a fun place to go, but be cautious of going for dinner."}
{"text":"I like Madison's for: * larger group meals where we didn't plan far enough in advance to get a reservation elsewhere  * NFL Sunday Ticket during football seasons and brunch  * cocktails/beers when near the majestic and everywhere else is really crowded and we don't want Great Dane beers.  * their tater tots are pretty tasty * cheese curds are greasy, but very melts/crunchy/cheesy/salty  Definitely not a go here all the time... and you are not missing anything by not coming here. But if you are, it's probably for one of the highlighted times above."}
{"text":"Solid spot.  Big TVs, good booze choices, decent food, friendly service. The kind of place where your medium-rare burger comes out medium-well, but you were expecting that, and it tastes pretty good anyway, plus your team is winning and you're sitting comfortably and having fun."}
{"text":"A few friends and I stopped in for some after dinner drinks. We are all out-of-towners. I thought this bar was so cute! Reminded me of \"Ball & Biscuit\" in Indy. Kinda rustic/modern decor. I was in love with the strawberry/rhubarb infused vodka. I tried one of their speciality drinks with it, which was good, then tried just the vodka and sprite. Amazing. So good. They have several infused vodkas that they make themselves(I think).  We also had the cheese curds appetizer (someone in our group hadn't had them yet, and it was our last night in town). They were delicious! Light, cheese was melty. MMMMmmmm. There are tvs, which give it kinda a sportsbar type feel. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I eat here often when I have to travel for work and don't want to buy groceries or haven't restocked on them yet. They redo their menu multiple times a year but its always pretty much the same. They usually have some form of a salmon dish which is usually prepared phenomenally well but often pricey. This plate usually does not have adequate sides with it so I add brussels sprouts to my order as a side.  Staff is friendly and well trained and place gets quite popular with your professionals on weekend+ thursday nights!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here too many times, but neither of my experiences at Madison's have been too great. I'm just going to throw in my hat and give a quick rundown of my thoughts:  - I've gone here for just food and drinks once. I remember the food being a little bit more expensive than I was expecting (like $2-3 more), and definitely not as good as other places that are within a block of there, such as The Great Dane, or the Tipsy Cow, or Natt Spil. It was too long ago for me to remember what I ordered, but I don't remember the menu being too adventurous. - The drink selection is just ok. It's a decent selection of taps, but the cans and specials favor domestics a bit too much for it to be an appealing place to go to for some. The cocktails are overpriced, considering that you can get a much better tasting one with much higher quality ingredients for less at nearby places (i.e Heritage). They're not bad though, and if you have the money to spend, they'll get you the buzz you want. - The environment is an awkward crossover between a nightclub and sports bar, which I guess works for them since there's a good overlap between those two crowds. It's definitely something to be aware of though if you're thinking of heading there. There's a section only for dancing, and on the weekends it gets bumping with a lot of top 40 jams. I'm personally not a fan of the crowd there or the music, but i'll give it credit for having a large space at least.  So overall, i'm not a fan of Madison's, but they probably don't care that i'm not a fan. They aren't aiming for my demographic, and are instead aiming for people with more liberal budgets who enjoy \"nightlife\" but also don't really want to venture out to real nightlife scenes."}
{"text":"I would go here again.   Stopped in on a Wednesday night with a large party because it was the only place we could find that didn't have a wait.   They had a really good Wisconsin beer pitcher special, and we ordered several pitchers. The waitress was just a bit slow, but she was nice.   Their menu doesn't have a huge selection, which doesn't bother me because so many restaurants have menu bloat these days and you know when the menu's huge, it's highly unlikely that all of it is good.   I had a wedge salad, and it was FANTASTIC. Really awesome blend of french dressing with good blue cheese and bacon. I could eat that all day. I wish I had another one right now.   I also had the beef sliders, which were good as well, maybe a slight bit dry but nothing hateful.   They were having a pretty good wing special and a couple of the people in our party ordered those, they looked really good.   The only minor issue I had was that when I went to get a drink at the bar I had to wait a while for some unknown reason. Maybe the bartender didn't see me but there were only like 3 other people at the bar so I'd say it would have been difficult to miss me standing there. For some reason it seemed more important to do dishes and clean up behind the bar. He wasn't very friendly but whatever."}
{"text":"How was this my first time here?  I was pleasantly surprised by its affordability. I definitely plan to make this one of my regular stops. I tried their truffle tots. Wow. The flavor is subtle yet bold. It is not overpowering and I can not stop thinking about them.  The only weird thing?  We ordered a round of drinks and then ordered another round. The prices were different each time. No happy hour special happening but a different price each time. Weird huh?"}
{"text":"The ambience was nice, the seating pretty comfortable, too. However, our party ended up being separated into 3 tables and all 3 tables were served separately. The first group had already finished eating before the last group got theirs. The food is WAY overpriced... $50 for a lukewarm French dip (was hailed as an Italian beef), a burger and their \"famous\" tots... Which looked identical to the Ore-Ida ones that I picked up from the grocery store last week for the kids only they were extremely salty. The highlight of the night was the pita chips that came with the artichoke dip, but the dip... Meh."}
{"text":"Don't be disused when you see the typical bar atmosphere, the artichoke dip is the best I've ever had and fish tacos are the third best my husband has tasted in his worldwide search for the best fish taco. (Number 1 was in Maui and number 2 are his own) great food!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with Madison's.  Happy Memories: -The food. -A happy hour featuring cheap Absolut mixed drinks. -One or two fun nights involving the dance floor. -An excellent New Years Eve celebration.  Hate Memories: -The ridiculously expensive drinks. -The slow service. -The people who go there.  Uggggghh...  Ask me about the guy (that's right, guy) who tried to initiate a physical fight with me!"}
{"text":"Madison's is my new favorite brunch spot! I haven't found a resto that does unlimited mimosas that *ACTUALLY* has good quality mimosas. If you're a mimosa fiend like I am, get the unlimited deal. They're generous with their pours, and super nice (which compliments a mimosa buzz, haha). Get out there while the weather is still nice!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice...dim lights, pretty bar, nice furniture. Service was great, and nice selection of beers on tap. Went here on a Friday night for fish fry. The fish was delicious! My husband had the perch, and I had the haddock. Both were cooked wonderfully...not too much breading and not greasy at all. However, we also ordered the cheese curds and those were way too greasy. I didn't care for the cole slaw because there was something weird/different about the sauce, and I think they should serve the sauces (ranch, tarter sauce, etc) in smaller containers, because the ones they use hold three times more than you need, which seems wasteful. Overall, a great experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I both had the Smoke Burger last weekend and... holy smoky delicious burger!!! It seriously rivals any burger I've ever had and possibly, any smoky BBQ I've had!!! These taste buds don't lie, nor would a super foodie like myself steer you wrong...you like smoky food?...you like burgers? Then you don't want to miss out on this taste explosion...it just wouldn't be fair to you :) I've been to Madison's a number of times and I've always had fantastic service...the servers have been so friendly and attentive...it's a fun atmosphere, with great service and great food! Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere at Madison's is 5 stars.  I've been here twice - once to watch a football game, the other for drinks and dinner. The crowd appears to be mostly young professional, the bar offers plenty of options, and the decor and TVs combine to create a sophisticated sports bar.   But the food is 2 stars, with some dishes flirting with 3.   Their featured tot dishes are fine. I decided to try the poutine, in this case made with tots rather than the traditional fries. It became apparent to me quite quickly that I don't like cold, non-fried cheese curds. Be advised, Madison's cheese curd appetizer comes with half fried curds and half non-fried. I also believe they use mozzarella, which just doesn't stack up to the cheddar curds.   On the next visit, my party tried the fish tacos, the Friday night special fish, the Mac and Cheese, and the pesto-something sandwich. Eh.  The one thing that was awesome: the sweet potato tots.  Bottom line: visit this swanky sports bar for some sweet potato tots, a Wisconsin beer, and a good view of the game. Do not come expecting a food orgasm. You will leave unsatisfied."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the NBA finals. We heard it was really the only place that played the volume for the game. It was perfect. 10 tvs and you could hear the game. When we first walked in on Thursday at 7:30 pm there were only two other people but the place slowly got packed! When we left at 10 every seat was taken.  Being from out of town we loved that almost every beer on tap is local. My husband loves the wings although I do think the appetizers are a bit pricy as they are the same price as the meals. They did have an awesome special for $2 pork sliders and the tator tots are the way to go at $4.50. The habenero hot tots holy mother! They are awesome and hot hot hot. Ordering the truffle tots with it made for a great balance. This is a great spot and really nice inside. 5 stars for the best place in Madison to watch a game!"}
{"text":"The shortest way I can describe the food here is that they pay attention but lost something in the cooking process itself. Our party's order was chicken wings (we wanted cheese curds but they were out) and an artichoke dip to start, and two burgers and fish tacos for entrees. My burger came with nice pickled vegetables, and the fries are not bad. The artichoke dip was creamy and had a really large portion.  However, this is all for naught if I want my burger medium rare and you give it to me medium well. You do well with a good buffalo sauce with the chicken wings, then spoil it by overcooking the chicken. Usually if a restaurant is doing a bad job, there's evidence of across-the-board carelessness. But the food here leaves me confused. The chefs got the hard part down - getting fresh ingredients, combining things in a sensible way - but suddenly lose all ability when it comes to some basic things. The mac and cheese side I had with my burger had a good combination of cheeses, but the pasta itself was over-boiled and soggy. Why? It's confusing and disappointing when everything looks as though you're going to have a good time, but then you bite in and all that optimism just evaporates."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to go dancing at night, but the DJ's just seem to be getting worse and worse.  They constantly play music that no one can dance to and definitely aren't open for requests.  Why even have a dance floor? On the plus side, the food is good.  Just don't bother going after 9 PM."}
{"text":"cool and open.  Little pricey but they give you good stuff in the ambience.  Wish you didn't have to pay to go downstairs."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner after a Badger Game with the snow falling and the temperatures dropping and were seated in a great corner booth right in the window in the back of the restaurant - it was a great, cozy spot.  Service was attentive and food great."}
{"text":"So it is a cool place but was not very busy on a Saturday night - so we were nervous and only had drinks and appetizers.  The cheese curds were average but the cheese plate was good with nice nut pairings.  Service was on the slow side. The drinks were good I had the afternoon delight and a strawberry drink.  I would say we might go back agin but not sure.  I think this is more of a bar than a restaurant  for the college kids.  TVs where nice in the bar area."}
{"text":"I have always thought of it being a little too 'bro-tastic' for my liking.  It's never been a place that I would put high on my list.  And this still may be the case for days other than Tuesday.  This Tuesday, I stopped in for their taco special ($1 ground beef, $2 chicken, $2.50 fish).  Of all , I thought the fish was the best.  The waitress stated it was perch but at that price point, I would be surpised if it was your run of the mill tilapia.  Regardless, paired with the salsa on the side, it was a decent bite.  They also have $4 housemade margaritas that, for the price, did the trick.  I still don't think this would be on my short list of places to stop at but on a Tuesday when I'm hungry and want some quick and cheap, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Came here for the night scene, so I have no input on the food!   Came here around 11 pm on a Saturday night, and I had a blast. $4 wells mixed with good music, soft lights, and lots of people. The drinks were just strong enough to be worth $4, and the service was very quick (impressive for 11PM on Saturday). The dance floor had four or five TVs displaying the music videos of the song playing, and the floor was pretty big. There is a large \"couch\" encompassing the dance floor, and there a quite a few tables. I was very happy with this layout.  No cover, and people were dressed in heels and ties. Seemed a little bit too good for a bar without cover and cheap drinks. I plan on coming back on a different night. Am not sure if I got lucky, or if Madison's is the place I want to come back to every Saturday night."}
{"text":"Never eaten here, but I hit up Madison's one Saturday night when some friends and I were feeling dance-y. The music and dance floor atmosphere definitely did not disappoint - great music with a good, continuous flow; minimal creepers. I was really loving this place until I ordered a margarita and received a super-sour (like, unpleasantly sour) concoction that cost about $8. :( If not for that drink, I'd happily raise this to 4 stars. Better luck next time, I'm hoping."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour specials, their house wine is delicious! The food has been excellent both times I have eaten here.  Edit, Went back recently, and thought the food was NOT as good. Bland macaroni and cheese and my favorite cobb-type salad had a weird lemon-y taste to it. Still love those fried chickpeas though."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and I typically order the brisket Benedict. It's incredible. Filling. Today.....I decided to veer away from my usual.  Coffee was watery. Water and cream...that's what it tastes like. Not sure what happened.   I ordered the Biscuits with Gravy and as soon as it came out....I regretted veering away.   The gravy was luuuuummmmppyyyyy. Bland, lumpy and between cold and lukewarm. I literally only ate one poached egg and couldn't eat the rest. See the picture...  What was interesting is the service. Everyone else was getting their water refilled around me and my glass was empty the whole time. It was never refilled....I'm so hungry, thirsty, and disappointed. I had high hopes because everyone else ordered amazing choices and they finished their plates and I still had a full plate left. Server never asked if I wanted a box which servers usually ask if there is a lot of food on a plate...she just asked, \"want me to take this away?\" And I just handed it to her. No questions asked.   Order anything BUT the Biscuits with Gravy."}
{"text":"My family of 4 and sister and husband came here during a Saturday Day Badger game to eat, drink and take in the game on the many screens.  Service was great, food was decent and drinks were well poured and mixed.  What makes this a 5 star review is the service we received.  Our 6 month old had a bit of a diaper fiasco and the server-in-training (Christina), provided us a spot to change him, brought a plastic bag for the clothes and even disposed of the mess!  Treatment of all types of guests really makes a difference!  Thank you from taking a possible horrible situation and making it easy."}
{"text":"My first experiences with Madison's were in my mid-20s and revolved around their weekend \"club\" nights. Deafening music, creepy dudes who grope, and a fight to get to the bar. Not my scene.   A couple years ago, though, we started going for Taco Tuesday and for Packers games, and I found that at any time aside from Friday and Saturday night I really like it.   Taco Tuesday: nothing fancy but it's cheap and will remind you of the stuff your mom made growing up [or, in my case, the taco joint whose name I can't recall that was located where Famous Yeti's Pizza in Stoughton now resides in the mid-90s]. Beef tacos are $1, chicken $2, and fish $3. While I usually prefer chicken, here I go for the beef tacos. My only complaint is that they are excessively greasy, but that also makes them taste wonderful, so whatever. You have your choice of hard or soft shell and it's served with salsa and sour cream on the side. The toppings vary based on your filling - beef gets shredded cheddar, lettuce, and tomato; chicken gets cabbage and something I forget; fish is gross* so I have no clue. [*Pertains to all fish served by anyone anywhere, not Madison's tacos specifically.]  The regular menu is also pretty tasty (the brisket sliders are rich and thus perfect for splitting). For Packers games they usually have some sort of drink and food specials going that are a good deal and usually $5 or less (the one that stands out was pulled pork sliders and tots - more than enough food for so cheap).   Service has always been good minus a couple hiccups with people being trained, but it's just that - they're new people being trained. Mistakes are going to happen, and they're always fixed. Not a big deal.   This isn't currently a weekly stop, but I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility if I stay in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"The only reason Madison's didn't get five stars right now is because we only had the cheese platter and some sweet potato tots to go with our bottle of Conundrum. DELISH! And the service was very good. Waitress forgot to put in our order of tots and brought it within minutes but didn't charge us."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here at the end of the night to dance so maybe this isn't a fair review but here it goes anyway.  This is definitely a place for the younger crowd...not me.  The dance floor is tiny and always crowded.  I usually have to cock block a creeper or two for my girlfriends.  The bar has a weird layout.  Seating in one room, bar in another room, dance floor in another room and restrooms tucked away downstairs with another seating area.  The flow is just not good...too many places for bottlenecks.  The restrooms are ok.  A few stalls, relatively clean and free of graffiti.  But it's so tucked away, and kind of dark.  Going downstairs to get there I'm always extra vigilant.  I've never had an issue, but I believe restrooms should be well lit, especially when they're tucked away in a dark lower level."}
{"text":"Madison's has been my absolute favorite place for the past year and a half or so. Great, friendly, fast service, amazing food reasonable prices, and an overall enjoyable atmosphere. Recently they have been making some changes all for the worse. They have taken off several popular, delicious menu items beloved by many. It is such a shame to see this happening because of the new chef I can only hope they come to their sense and bring back these items before losing too much business. The service has also slowed down considerably and gone down in overall quality. Very disappointed in my once favorite establishment to say the least. I also find my mimosa glass empty quite frequently during the \"bottomless\" mimosas. Used to always feel like I was getting my money's worth, now not so much."}
{"text":"I've been to Madison a couple of times and never been to this bar/restaurant and I'm kicking myself for just finding this place.  The food was absolutely amazing and at a solid price.  If you like spinach artichoke dip, you won't find a better one.  This definitely ain't the canned stuff.  After dinner, we hit up the bar.  I'm not sure if it was just that night, but the people here were absolutely gorgeous.  Did a Miss America convention just get out?  Drinks were pretty solid too.  The downside of this place is that the dance floor is in the basement and we never made it down there because the line was so long and they were past capacity."}
{"text":"Madison's was better than I expected it to be, but there were some serious issues that make it an avoid. We ordered a Spinach Artichoke dip that was pretty decent, came with some veggies and maybe 5 small slices of sourdough. We finished all that, had about half of our dip left and asked for more bread. They said it was a $2 charge for more bread. Then the bud girls came over and started trying to give us whistles.  While we were eating. It is fine if you are sitting at the bar to bother your customers, but when you are eating some of the most expensive bread in the country, it is nice to be able to enjoy it in peace."}
{"text":"This is a great bar to go to if you don't want to be overrun by college kids. Went here for a surprise bachelor party with 15 people and they did an excellent job catering to us; especially with last minute notice. The food is actually pretty good considering it's a bar. At night it seems like the place to be for young professionals. Like to dance? They have a seperate room in the basement for people who like that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I used to know this as a crowded bar with a rowdy dance floor until one night I went for dinner because everywhere else in the area had a line.  The food is actually very good! They also have interesting cocktails. On Tuesday nights they have a taco Tuesday that is far superior to Diego's. $3 margaritas that are fresh and delicious and dollar tacos. Sit outside in the summer.  The only cons are that I wish the menu had more variety (also there were things on it I liked that no longer are on it) and that the service can be a little slow sometimes, but not always."}
{"text":"Good fun time.  Good service and good drinks.  My only problem is that they did not let me in with my Badger hockey jersey.  So i went next door to the great dane and bought a great dane shirt and got let in.  Go figure..."}
{"text":"Just tried to have dinner there. NEVER AGAIN. Was told its first come first serve and if we saw a table open we had to try and grab it. Just say you no longer want to serve dinner. Have eaten here in the past and was never protocol before. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Madison's is the place to be when the DJ is good and the music is bumpin'.   I can't give Madison's a full 5 stars because the two times I've been there, I have had vastly different experiences. The crowd is always great, but I think the music really makes or breaks the experience. The first time I was there, the music was sorely outdated and made for awkward dancing. Last night was a completely different story - the top 40 playlist made for great fist-pumping dance moves on the floor. It was great.  Drinks are reasonably priced, seating is abundant, and best of all, the women's bathroom is large enough to accommodate large mobs of females trying to share the same sink/toilet/mirror space at the same time."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday for brunch. Really creative brunch dishes, including smaller dishes, which I really appreciate. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Either if it's for drinks or dinner or both it's great. Love the staff as they are always friendly and fun to talk to. Always have had great service there. And great happy hour specials!  I have had the cheese plate which was good but you can never go wrong with there tater tots. I have tried the truffle tots and the beer cheese. I loved them both but the truffle tots are my favorite. Also for entrees I have had the fish tacos, Mac & cheese, and the hanger steak. My favorite is the steak. The sauce over the top is delicious. Also great crowd."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink! Definitely plan to come back and try the food.  Fun atmosphere (busy), great & attentive bartenders. They have several types of liquor that they make in-house----try the Strawberry & Rhubarb Vodka! Yum!"}
{"text":"Pretty chill spot. Outdoor patio seating had people. Fourth of July so it wasn't busy. Sat inside and enjoyed the Mac and cheese. No complaints about the food but I wasn't wowed. The service was fine."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch \"bottomless mimosas\"... Need I say more?  Our glasses rarely were less than a quarter full before someone came around with a carafe to fill them back up. Staff is very friendly and attentive, which is refreshing and a huge plus.   Ample outside and indoor seating provides lots of options for small and large 8+ person groups. If you're a sports person you'll likely want to sit inside and peruse one of the 6 flat screens with different games on."}
{"text":"Because I travel a lot for business I am always looking for spots with great food AND good bar seating. This is surprisingly hard to find.   I was pleasantly surprised with the salmon at Madison's. I got it with nothing on it and it was actually delicious. The broccoli was okay but a little too garlicky for my liking.   My service was great. Not being from Wisconsin I figured I would try out a local beer. I tried Spotty Cow (that might be wrong!) and loved it.   The atmosphere was pretty chill for a Thursday night which is exactly what I needed after a long week.  I would definitely return on another trip to Madison for the salmon."}
{"text":"Short but sweet visit. The Live on King Street with Cracker was performing outside. I stopped into Madison's for a cocktail and a taco. Ordered the Spicy Cucumber drink and the brisket taco. To my surprise the taco came with chips and salsa. All for $4.00 (well not the drink too). What a deal. The drink paired well with the tangy bbq sauce in the taco. I was impressed. Service at the bar was quick and attentive. Definitely coming back for those truffle tots."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and get good food and drink with friends! I got the poutine and it's my favorite in Madison thus far!"}
{"text":"Came here on a early evening Friday night for dinner. We got seated right away and our waitress was really great and attentive. We actually made it during happy hour (which ended at 7) so the beers on tap were only $3.00. They have a great selection of IPAs so I was really happy :)  Friday there's a fish special, so I chose that with my choice of a side (Mac and cheese) and coleslaw. It was pretty good. We ordered one more drink after dinner, I don't remember the name of the drink I got, but it was a mixed drink with some sort of tea and I really liked it. I'd definitely come back here, even if it's not for food, it's a nice atmosphere, has good drinks and good service."}
{"text":"I'm a bit old for this bar but my group wanted to hit one more spot before we called it a night.  I hadn't been to Madison's in several years and was pleased with what I found.  We sat at a table near the door and even though the bar wasn't super crowded yet (it was about 10 pm), it was very loud inside.  Our server came just as we were debating moving to an outside table.  She took our order and told us if we moved outside she would find us.  Sure enough, we moved and she found us.  There was dancing for those of us who wanted to dance.  There was good service from our server and the security during our whole stay.  So Madison's is for young urban professionals and a place to meet up and be seen.  But the staff was excellent and the drink prices were very good.  So I may end up here again if friends drag me out."}
{"text":"Here on two occasions now to grab a few cocktails and a small bite to eat. Both times have been very good for what I was there for.  Service has been very attentive and can make a good drink, try one of the infused vodkas while you're there as well, several to choose from.  Both times I've been to Madison's I've gotten a platter of the Tater Tots, the mexican ones I believe. Basically it's a nacho platter, with the Tots replacing Chips. They tasted as good as the menu makes them sound, or maybe i'm just a slut when it comes to Tater Tots, come on, how can you NOT order them when you see them on a menu? Especially when they're smothered with ingredient normally found on nachos? Haha! Anyhow, check this place out with some friends or for a casual date night out, it seems like a joint that might get pretty busy in the evening/late night so if you're looking to eat I would try and hit it up a little earlier. Enjoy!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Definitely try the dry rub wings with maple sriracha. So unique and so tasty. Their burgers are great too! Would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, pretty basic bar food. Service was ok never got forks though. Ambience was nice with good music and cool decor. Nice bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not as great as I was told or hoped for.  I got the fish tacos and felt that I got robbed.  Each taco had a very small single piece of fish and fixings.  There was more tortilla then anything else.  Son's burger was nothing special.  I understand it's going to cost a little more for items due to location,  but you would think the menu and food would stand out.    I will say the staff was spectacular.  Very polite and professional despite how crazy busy they were."}
{"text":"I will say that it's gotten better.   I remember back in the day when Madison's drink menu was atrocious, almost en par with something like The State Bar or Mondays, just more expensive.  (aka, Cosmos have gasoline for vodka).  But their drink menu now has a yummy variety of martinis, like the \"Matador\" (think Margarita Martini), or a Tartini.  But frankly, if you want a REALLY good martini in a MUCH better, non-loud-crowded-people-bumping-on-top-of-you-with-drinks-because-martini-glasses-are-tough-to-handle type place, all you have to do is cross the street to Opus, or walk down a block for Cocoliquot, or go across to the Casbah, and you'll have BOTH yummy drinks and good appetizers....  Also, for $8/martini (without tip) I expect a better atmosphere where the martinis are not spilling everywhere, which well.. happens when inexperienced yuppie wannabes who just got their first expense account and decided to buy the khakis and striped shirts and try their first Dewars black label and stating that they're used to this good life get a drink.  Ok, that IS here AND there.  Yes.  This is my review and I'm sticking to eat."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday for lunch and our first warning sign should have been that the place was completely empty. Everyone ordered either burgers or chicken wings, both pretty standard bar foods. The chicken wings were actually chicken tenders with dipping sauce on the side. When you order buffalo chicken wings you expect to get them tossed in the sauce, but maybe that's just me. The burgers were all ordered medium or medium rare and they all came out extremely well done, more like charred to a crisp, with little to no flavor. The only thing saving them was the delicious sharp cheddar cheese on top. Seems like this restaurant is trying to make it look like they have upscale bar food, when really the quality is well below par.  Our server is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars- I can't remember her name, but she was very attentive, accommodating, and friendly."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with three friends last night. At first I was very glad to be sat immediately, especially on graduation night. But, I soon found out that the sub-par food was the reason there wasn't a wait for a table.  What was wrong about this dining experience? Allow me to enumerate:  1) The floor wasn't level, which slanted the table and had me worried a drink would topple over  2) The flatware was rolled in heavy-duty paper towels. No, not even paper napkins, industrial strength paper towels. Also, the server insisted on returning to our table simply to place cheap paper bar napkins under each of our glasses. From the sidewalk I was expecting to see a bit more class in their presentation -- not to mention the fact that linens are less harsh on the environment over the course of their \"lifetime\" in a restaurant. Oh, well.  3) The food was far from unique, heck, it was about as \"cuisine\" as anything you might get at a truck stop diner.  4) The server, and the manager, refused to leave us alone. The server returned to our table, immediately after taking our order simply to ask, \"Is there anything I can do for you while you wait?\" No, there isn't, or we would have asked you 2 minutes ago, now go away, we're talking. Also, I think our server stopped by to see if the food was to our liking 4 times. Go away! Maybe he was new and had never been a server before, that would explain a lot.  5) The server never came by to refill drinks, he would only ask if the food was good and then disappear, leaving our glasses empty.  I may return, if I find myself in the area, and ravenous, and every other restaurant has a long wait. In the unlikely event that I do return, I'll be sure to avoid Perry's section, I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"The few times I've eaten here, I have found the food to be decent and appropriately priced.  Most of the time I visit, however, is late at night on a weekend. I have had some fun times at Madison's, but it is usually a bit too overcrowded for my tastes. It is a complete meat market after 10pm, and there is a preponderance of creepy dudes scaring away the women on the dance floor. Too many open collars with gold chains and cologne.  On the occasions the creepy dudes are in short supply, it can be a fun time. The bartenders are solid, and the drinks are usually strong enough for the price."}
{"text":"I went here when I was in Madison for a wedding in between the ceremony and the reception. Someone in my group had been here before. They have lots of different appetizers and a good selection of beers. Since we were in a group we got several appetizers to share. The poutine was amazing! It was just as good as the first time I had poutine in Canada on my honeymoon. The atmosphere in the bar is a good mix between being able to talk with friends and watch the game. Will definitely come again when I am able to!"}
{"text":"Madison's has an awfully ideal location right by the Capitol.  The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was pretty nice too: cool combo of a bar and a restaurant.  Huge tvs for sports-lovers in both the bar area and the dining area.  Also, the seat cushion for the booth we sat in was super comfy. I swear it was tempurpedic.  As for the food, I ordered the tequila-chili chicken with garlic-lemon green beans and some pita on the side, and that was quite yummy. But the mac and cheese was fabulous, a delicious mix of penne with bacon and a beautiful blend of different cheeses. So rich, so creamy, so on point.  Overall, pretty decent spot to grab some grub or watch a game."}
{"text":"This is a great atmosphere to pre-party at before dinner.  The bar is full with plenty of places to sit and talk before heading out.  The drink selection is excellent, the staff is approachable, and the people are awesome.  Get some dinner there soon!"}
{"text":"I have had awesome dinners and great nights at Madisons!  I think the food is amazing and would recommend it to anyone--especially the shrimp diabolo (soooo phenomenal) and martini burgers--so many good aps, too.      The service has always been really great, although, looking at what Tim B., said below it is clear to me Madison is so used to poor service, we have forgotten what good service is.  Even though there may be a fine line between attentive and \"too attentive, I'd rather have too much than the alternative of not knowing where the hell my server is all the time.        As one of my favorite places to go for night scene, I love Madisons for the sweet variety of music they play, the people and the atmosphere.  I am not much of a martini person, but Madison's is known for their martini's and a ton of people order them.  The night scene is more so \"big city\", which is refreshing in Madison and it is nice to have a classy place to dress up enjoy great dinner, drinks and good music.  They even have a DJ on Thursday nights now upstairs.       They have a ton of TV's and is a great place to watch the Badgers or NFL football (also hard to find a good place to do this in Madison).  This place is so much fun and has so much to offer--I hope it gets the appreciation it deserves."}
{"text":"Im surprised at the negative reviews on this place.  Madison's is consistently one of my favorite spots to eat in Madison (ha). Full disclosure, I have only been here to eat, not dance.   The cheese curds are easily top 5 in Madison..A bold statement that may offend some or many, I know. But I am sticking to it. They have great cocktails..although a little small but hey, thats \"fancy,\" right? They also have a quality selection of beers on tap.   I have never had anything but great service and a friendly wait staff. The food here is fresh, unique and served with beautiful presentation. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"By day: An above-average sports bar. Many people I know don't think of this place as a sports bar, making it easier for me to get a table for a big packer/badger game (heh heh heh). Most spots have a decent view of a few TVs. By night: The real discotheque in Madison, one of the few places with consistently good DJs and dancing. Beware that it will be very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Fortunately, the bar service is adept and can process orders in a timely fashion.  The menu here has been revamped recently, but I've been pleasantly surprised. The nachos have a rich cheese sauce reminiscent of the flavor of box mac and cheese packets. I mean this in a good way, and it is great with the jalapenos. The salad was better than most sports bars but I could go with a little more selection in the ideal world. Still need to try the burger, I shall report back soon."}
{"text":"I feel like Madison's has two identities. There is Madison's the restaurant, serving up yummy food and ambiance, and then there is Madison's the dance club, which comes around every Friday and Saturday.   Admittedly I am much more familiar with Madison's the dance club.   This used to be my spot. My friends and I were here every weekend, and it was a BLAST. So much fun! The location is perfect if you're wanting to hop around, and it's directly next door to a large parking garage, if you're DD or staying safe enough to get yourself home. The garage allows overnight parking too, so don't risk it. The DJ's were always on point, and they take requests. It always gets a little crazy inside. Super packed. Sometimes you have to wait to get in, but I've never had to wait too long, really. It can be difficult to wiggle your way up to the bar, and the drinks are a little steeper in price compared to some other Madison establishments, but it's whatever. I loved dancing the night away here. Now I don't really come here that much, outgrew my dance phase, haha.   Madison's the restaurant isn't a bad choice if you're downtown and want something to eat. They offer brunch as well as dinner, I myself have only had dinner here. The menu is a decent size. Not overly extensive, yet leaves enough options that everyone can find something that works for them. Pricing is really good for a downtown spot, too!"}
{"text":"I have not quite figured this place out. I have nothing against it just seems the crowd can be quite diverse. It never seems to have the same vibe the few times I have gone there. The have about 12 beers on tap and decent drinks. I found out the hard way when I ordered a bottled sour red ale. (Kind of my new spring craze and flying hound in Fitchburg has a great one on tap) sorry about the sidetrack. It turns out the bottle cost 12 bucks for a twelve oz. would have been nice to know when I ordered it off the board because it was ok not great.  The bartenders were very friendly and nice. There were two guys at 7:30 in their mid 40's ass wasted and another guy sleeping/passes out at the other. Maybe two friendly by not asking them to leave."}
