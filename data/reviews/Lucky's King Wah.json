{"text":"My friend and I wanted Chinese food but was looking for something fast n good, so our friend recommend King Wah Express to us.  This place is kind of hidden behind Sonics on 43rd ave new Northern, we ordered the orange chicken, Kung pao beef, crab puffs, and house fried rice, oh man the food was amazing and their is so affordable our total bill was under $20.  We are definitely going back with some friends.  If you're look for reasonable and great Chinese food, I would suggest that you try this place.  They have sit down, take out, and delivery too.  Very friendly people!"}
{"text":"Food quality pretty good and tons of choices. Location is sketchy. So many choices that you really need to be Chinese (or go with someone who is) to truly enjoy the place. I tried it based on the New Times recommendation. I have been twice with groups, so have had a chance to experience about 20 of their dishes. Hits and misses. Some dishes perfect, others too salty, too bland, etc. For example, I've never had better hot and sour soup (even when I was in China), but the duck dish was not so good. If you don't speak Chinese just be respectful and put yourself at the chef's mercy. Ask for whatever they are in the mood to make and you want the best authentic Chinese food you've ever had. You won't be disappointed because the price is reasonable given the quality of the ingredients and the dishes they are capable of making. With the right business partner King Wah could go upmarket and make a killing. First thing, review everything you think should be on the menu with a critic and only put what you're good at on the menu. You don't need to have every possible dish on the menu. Two, move to a location people aren't afraid to go to. Three re-name to something that sets you apart for every other dive Chinese take out place."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese Hong Kong style along with other areas of China in the Phoenix area. I've spent time in Hong Kong and have eaten in every traditional Chinese place in the Phoenix area and the new chef along with fantastic service with the new owners make this the place to eat outside of the east valley. Of course order off the Chinese menu. I do not ever order the lunch menu anywhere as it will be the Americanized food. You will be very pleased you ate here!"}
{"text":"The sweet and sour sauce wasnt warm. I like it warm."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss .  Prices are very high and the food quality leaves much to be desired. If you go there to eat you must request your BBQ ribs to be fresh or you take the chance that they will come out dry and burnt. 
Also please remember that this restaurant does not give you a cup of soup with the lunch special, in fact they don't even have cups of soup.  They have $7.00 bowls of soup. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We were just looking for a Chinese place to eat when we came across this place online. It says online they are open til 10, however they are open Thursday's apparently till 9:30... we arrived at 9:15, which is tough for restaurant owners we know. We were ready to be turned away cuz it was so late but they kindly invited us in, asked us if we would like the special & not wanting to be a pain we accepted. The waiter checked what kind of meat we were ok with & asked about spiciness then went to create us something. It was pretty cool & I wish more restaurants had that type of option. & the food came in about 2 minutes later (& no it was not cuz they went and gave us old food that had been sitting for hours, this was hot fresh delicious food). Really really really good food. They were genuinely interested in talking to us & seeing that the food was good. All in all, excellent experience, excellent food, excellent speed, excellent service. We will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I accidently find this small Chinese restaurant in a stripe mall and they serve some very authentic Chinese food.  Items we tried out are double spice chicken which is crispy and tasty, chicken meat inside are moist and juicy.  It's a great appetizer or it could serve as a main entree.  We also have their roast duck and Chinese beef stew.  Both are excellent and very authentic, it taste as good as San Francisco.  We travel from San Francisco to Phoenix and now we found authentic Chinese food just like home in Glendale, Az.  We had the stir fry vegetable which was excellent too."}
{"text":"No flavor. food tastes like the Chinese buffet places. Ordered a sesame chicken expecting a heavy dark sauce. In return I got a honey flavored chicken plate."}
{"text":"Chinese done right. The sweet and sour chicken was just perfect. Their crab puffs were unique and very tasty. Their prices are very fair, $5 for full plate during their lunch special. $7.25 any other time. The place is extremely clean and well taken care of. This is what I expect when I search for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place was pathetic I do not recommend it.  I had fried rice that was plain nothing came in it sesame chicken this combo came with a spring roll (not an egg roll )and one crab puff. This came up to about $9 and change, I knew that Price was to good to be true. I picked up my order. The food wasn't hot but warm, no flavor I'd never seen sesame chicken so pale. The crab puff was the only decent thing. I have no idea how the rating is so high. That just shows the rating mean nothing because they sure were very inaccurate in this case."}
{"text":"5 stars for this neighborhood gem! Just moved in close by and was looking for somewhere easy to stop on the way home. Tried a few places around the area and this one is definitely the best. Mainly because the vegetables are always fresh! Beef with broccoli, shrimp with veg... yum!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Before you go, Google and print out their \"secret\" menu. If you don't, you'll be sorry. On the walls, they have a menu that's written only in Chinese; these items aren't on the regular menu. My husband and I always order the curry with pork, and the soy sauce duck. The flavor of the soy sauce duck is well balanced. They also have honey walnut prawns, which isn't always offered at other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food and prices are reasonable! I always order their Hong Kong Style Noodles and their whole chicken...great stuff! Their fried rice is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"King Wah has been with new owners several times over the last decade. The current owners have been here 2 years. They are back to real Chinese food. It's delicious! Luckily they have pictures up on the wall that depicts their entrees. They have orders with fungus (this is a good thing) lotus root, and tofu leaves, all of which are really hard to find in Arizona. 
It is not in the best looking strip mall, but don't let that deter you! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"The fried rice here was as good as I've ever had, and the pea pod leaves with garlic sauce were fantastic.  The prices are really low for what you get, so it's a good value to eat here.  I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I dont know what gruel tastes like but I'm sure it tastes like what this place serves up. Food was disgusting. If I could give King Wah no stars I would."}
{"text":"We went there last weekend and found out it's under new management - ordered our regular stuff and see if they kept the same quality ... Not terrible or anything but not even close to what it was before. The previous chef (I believe that was the previous owner) cooked awesome food but now it's completely different ... unfortunately we will need to find a new Chinese place to eat."}
{"text":"Very delicious authentic Chinese food at a reasonable price.  We had large, succulent oysters with X.O. sauce, roasted duck, fried chicken with a salt and pepper dip, and clams with black bean sauce.  Everything was so fresh and the sauces that accompanied each dish were perfect.  The service was excellent as well.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant.  Real deal legit OG.  I had the best beef tendon claypot here."}
{"text":"They have great people working here but the food quality is not good. I ordered twice cooked pork and it was just bacon.  I have ordered this dish before at other restaurants and it hasn't been like this.  They are under new management. Maybe this is way."}
{"text":"Having just returned from China, this place is legit. Everything was amazing and the chef was so nice and wonderful. I am super excited to bring my Chinese friends here for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a gem hidden inside glendale. By the name you'd assume it might be an another American style Chinese restaurant, but don't be fooled! It's serving up authentic Cantonese food that takes me back home. My favorite orders are the salt and pepper squid it always arrives hot and crispy, the steamed flounder which is just the way I remembered growing up with, and the stewed beef brisket bowl (I might not have the exact name for this dish) which is tender and flavorful. For those less adventurous, there is still your standard fare although I have not tried those. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I will definitely be back when I come to Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This was my fourth time at the restaurant. The beef and cilantro  soup was good but it started to go down hill. Pots tickers had no meat it tastes  like  frozen food. Fish filet had no flavor. Fried chicken tasted like there was no seasoning and no sauce. . Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Their wanton soup is great  they are large and the soup is very flavorful.  Their Hong Kong fried rice is the best in town. Their eggs and shrimp is a great dish . Their long beans with garlic sauce was spicy and had"}
{"text":"I love this place, We drive 40 miles from Gilbert to eat here and every time We leave Happy. Their specialty dishes are deep fried tofu,  peking pork chop, walnut shrimp and they make their own duck. Most of their dishes are under $10, very very reasonable"}
{"text":"Not fancy, but clean and friendly. Dining room has two large tables with revolving servers in the center for group dining.

I had Hong Kong style shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour pork, and asked for NOT spicy. They offer it as hot as you like.

The fried rice is a meal in itself, with large pieces of scrambled egg and minced pork. the shrimp perfectly cooked. Not too much batter on the pork, which was also cooked through, but still tender.

The two large plates and a can of Sprite ran $20 with tax. Not bad, considering I have dinner for tomorrow, too."}
{"text":"The one star is for the rude ness of the owner and I assume his wife. Tried getting some information on what some of the times were and what was in it. They seemed very put out we were trying to place a to go order. The place was empty so there should not be rushed. After we asked about a few things he was sitting down by the register and then started talking In Chinese to the lady. He started razing his voice and she told us he didn't want to sell to us. What why??? She just said he said no."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The Hong Kong special is out of this world good. I highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. The neighborhood, not so good. The building, run down and dodgy. The Food, fantastic and delicious. The service, absolutely welcoming (this may be in part to the owners knowing my GF and her family).

We ended up getting 3 dishes and I wish I could tell you what they were. However, I didn't order and everyone was speaking Cantonese so... We ended up getting a short-rib dish, a fried noodle dish and a beef and rice noodle dish.

The short ribs were alright, they had a tasty, albeit very strong 5 spice seasoning to them and were a bit on the chewy side but the flavor was good.

The Fried Noodle dish was very tasty. The noodles were fried separately from the rest of the dish so they retained a crunchiness while eating them, the bok choy and gravy were very complementary of the various meats in the dish.

The spicy beef and rice noodle dish was ordered with some random greens added. I think they just threw in whatever was fresh. Either way, my brother and GF said they like that the best. The gravy was good and the beef was tasty. My favourite part was the choy sum, crunchy and delicious.

The place was pretty full when we walked in and got pretty loud with the other two large groups. Once one of the groups left the noise level decreased exponentially and the owner came out and started chatting it up with everyone still dining.

As stated in other reviews, there are many non-menu items/specials posted to the walls but they are all in Chinese so I will just leave that stuff to question (though they might be fun to try one day)."}
{"text":"Up till 2015 Lucky's King Wah Express was considered to be the very best Cantonese Restaurant in the Metro Phoenix area. The restaurant has changed ownership and now offers many Chinese Menus. This isn't a fancy restaurant as it is a little worn and located in an older strip mall.

THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL CHINESE RESTAURANT

 They have an online menu with many authentic style Asian Dishes like Buddha Rolls, Taiwanese Three Cup Chicken and something with a Century egg.

They also have a take out menu with mostly American/Chinese Favorites.

They have a sit down menu that is a mix of American/Chinese and some Chinese Foods like Fish Hot Pot.

**********
AND they have the Chinese Specials....it is the pictures all around the restaurant and on the outside window. The Chinese Specials might be written in Chinese on the Chinese Boards also posted in the restaurant.
************

We started with the Buddha Rolls (on-line menu and Chinese Specials). They are crispy fried tofu skins stuffed with vegetables. If you never had them before you should try them because they are very tasty and fried nicely. If you had them before here pre-2015 you will be disappointed because these have less flavor.

From the Dining Room Menu we shared the Szechwan Chicken. The chicken was tender and this dish was nice and spicy and contained fresh cabbage, carrots, celery, and zucchini. The sauce was one note and very sweet......

We also shared the Flounder two ways (on-line menu) WE received a whole flounder were the filets were sautéed with carrots, snow peas and onions in a simple one note chicken laced sauce. The skin, head, tail and bones were lightly coated and deep fried. 

I think there is a possibility to find great gems of dishes if you know what to look for.

Outside sign reads King Wah."}
{"text":"This used to be my goto Chinese place over 10 years ago. Well let's just say my tastes have become more sophisticated 'cause it's just your average run if the mill Chinese/American food with no surprises or intrigue.

The Chow Fun was pretty good and the Tofu was acceptable I just cant imagine how this was my goto place so long ago.. was I really that blind? I was still in my twenties, what did I know?"}
{"text":"The address is right... but I'm pretty sure it's now called Lucky's King Wah since it got new owners and new cooks. 

My family and I LOVE this place! It's delicious and you can order AUTHENTIC Chinese food here! :D Plus, the prices are so good compared to other Chinese restaurants! Good food and great pricing? Who can beat that?

The location is a bit sketch... but I say worth it for the food! Just make sure you have your car locked. ;)

I would highly suggest any of the following: (spelling may be a bit off)

Fried Tofu with Shrimp puree on top
Sing-hi Chicken
Suy-gow Soup (Like giant wantons)
Honey Walnut Shrimp

Enjoy! :D"}
{"text":"The owners of this restaurant used to own Lucky's Chinese.  This is the place you would go to for Sochow style fried tofu.  Crispy on the outside, a little bit of shrimp paste and the inside piping hot and soft.  Literally unmatched by anywhere else.  The restaurant is small and service is quick.  Lots of the menu is written only in Chinese on specials on white boards.  If you have access to someone who reads Chinese, this is the time to bring them.  Food is not meant to be fussy or fancy.  This is the type of food that many Cantonese families would make for themselves during the week.  They will let you bring in seafood and they will cook it for you for a small service charge.  Totally worth it.  Even if you don't bring in seafood, the mussels are to die ford as well as any shrimp dish.  I make the drive out here and ignore the fact that it's next to a scary massage place and quincenara store.  Give it a go, worth your time.
Not to miss dishes
Stir fried freshwater vegetables
Duck braised with taro
Suzhou style fried tofu
Braised Beef bowl (sacha flavored beef with vermicelli noodles)
salt and pepper shrimp"}
{"text":"My usual Chinese spot was closed so we ventured here.  The service was super friendly and based on that alone, I'd totally come back but the food had a funky taste to it.  I thought it was just one dish but no, it was everything."}
{"text":"Very impressed!! Picked up food for take out and the dining room was clean!! Fried rice. Lo main, veggie rolls, orange ckn, beef and veggies & Kung pao ckn all great! Really good flavor! Will def be back."}
{"text":"Nice place. I am vegetarian and they are able to make their dishes with tofu no problem. They also offer me different ways to customize dishes to be meatless. They made soup without meat for me too. No extra charges, just great customer service. Food is good, not the BEST, but still very good. I have been back many times now mainly because they are so nice to my needs as a customer."}
{"text":"gross. althought i would be the first to say that there is an extreme dearth of good Chinese food in the whole frickin' valley, this is definitely on the LOWWWWW end of the spectrum. so. 

i've been here twice, as the husband's family seems to like eating here. i mean, it's new and clean... but the food? has gone downhill. the first time (about a year ago?) was decent. now, it's just gross. half of the items we ordered were EXACTLY THE SAME THING, but with different veggies/meat. and it wasn't like it was GOOD so you were happy about it. no. it was gross. shudder. and honestly? that's all i have to say.

THE END."}
{"text":"I was here last year around November or so and the food was pretty good.  We decided to come here for a change from Great Wall.  So 18 of us (that is only some of our family) went there tonight.  The \"adult\" table ordered and our \"kid\" table order for ourselves.  Here is the low down:

1.  Chicken cream corn soup - Ok, a little bland
2.  Fried tofu - This dish was AWESOME and the sauce was excellent
3.  Pot stickers - They were store bought and they fried them, not pan fried
4.  Yan Chow Fried Rice - It was pretty good, the kids loved it
5.  Chicken Chow Mein - It dish looked d'lich but the taste was missing
6.  Walnut Shrimp - It tasted funny not sure if it was the shrimp or sauce
7.  Peking Pork Chops - This dish was great and the sauce was tasty
8.  Beef Stew with Noodle - More fat than beef and noodles were ok
9.  Pepper Beef Ribs - The flavor was ok, but some of the beef was a little more rare than we like

All in all, it was ok."}
{"text":"Being Chinese, I am very impressed by this place. Doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that deter you. Chicken is very crispy and one of my favorite dish. Nice change from always going to Great Wall. Very reasonably priced also."}
{"text":"I saw a recommendation for this place in a Phoenix magazine so we decided to give it a try. We ordered dinner combos with orange chicken and Kung pao chicken. We were extremely disappointed. Not only was the food made of low quality it had horrible flavor. This is by far one of the worst Chinese food places we have tried."}
{"text":"specifically ordered salt and pepper squid. we brought it to their attention and they kept forcing we ordered \"fish\",  instead of salt and pepper squid. um sorry no,  plus it was the fried catfish they serve at cheap buffets. we asked how much for this dish and was met with \"around the same price\"...... it was. 50 cents more and not even a sorry. my friend is allergic to catfish and he left itching lol.  plus even their tax was .40 cents more and you can't argue with them because the whole tab is written in Chinese. sigh, we're regulars too."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. The owners have change a few times but the current owners are very nice and the food is great for the price. You can always get a table and even if we have to wait a little bit it's a great place where both sides of my family gather for dinners. They have authentic Cantonese food which I appreciate being Chinese and having gone to many places throughout my life."}
{"text":"10/14/15-Ok, finally made it back to try Beef Chow Fun, Chinese Greens sautéed w/garlic and Spicy Fish Fillet.  Very good, I really liked the Chow fun because it was lite on soy, I know some prefer more/darker.

Under new management/ownership, again...had to try...all veggie dinner: Mapo Tofu, Spicy String Beans & Shitake mushrooms with Chinese Greens.  I fig it was a good test, if you can't cook veggies or tofu, you've got issues.  They even added back some specials on the white boards.  The waitresses were friendly and the service was fast.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"wah wah...to the new owners of the Wah :( 

So King Wah closed for like a month back in October. They reopened as promised...but under completely new ownership. 

Menu is the same....but the food, Its different....in a not the same tasty Wah we are used to. 

Tuki didn't even beg for food. 

We are sad, this was our go to Chinese delivery. Now we must take on the task of finding something new."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Chinese food in Glendale, look no further, this is the one. 

Their chicken? just the right amount of crisp.
The sauce that comes with it? Heavenly.
Preserved egg with pork soup? 
You'll want nothing more in life. Lol
And lastly the fried rice is so well done.. Like really.

The new management is doing well, I'm glad of their continued work in serving exceptional Chinese cuisine. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place was nice. The staff was friendly and the food was good. None of that generic stuff. All very authentic. I had the orange chicken and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The fish ball noodle soup and sour vege with beef is super tasty here. Definitely very traditional."}
{"text":"We (5) ate here for mother's day and it was fantastic. We ordered spicy salty pork,  shanghai chicken, hot and sour soup and beef chow fun plus tilapia with some gingery gravy on top. Delicious. 78 bucks plus tip. I highly recommend this place and want to come back already"}
{"text":"I just love when I find a Hidden Gem in the Hood!

 Lo Mien, Fried Rice and Orange Chicken was amazing!! Pretty big portions as well."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Egg drop soup was plain, no veggies, tofu etc.  Ordered the Mongolian Chicken - way too salty and oily.  Cashew chicken, same thing.  Our food had a strange taste to it, we notified the waitress and she said there was nothing she could do about it.  I'll also add that we were the only ones in the restaurant so who knows how long the food had been sitting.  Soda comes in a can, no soda fountain.  Our family enjoys oriental food, but this is one place we won't come back to."}
{"text":"Very Delicious food. Our Favorites are the spicy Chili chicken, salt and pepper wings, and  house fried rice."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night the orange chicken dinner combo was good and enough to feed 2, the Sing Hi Chicken was also tasty, I was warned that it would take 15mins to prepare which wasn't an issue but the chicken was only luke warm when I received it...the sauce  on it was delish.

Had the hot & sour soup which had big chunks of tofu, plenty of pork pieces and a total of 6 large shrimp in it...again this was tasty, my only gripe is it only comes in 1 size...a large and a few of the shrimp weren't deveined.

The waitress seemed very impatient and tried to rush me on more than one occasion when i had questions related to the menu, this wouldn't have been an issue if the place was bust but there was 2 tables there....and mine was one of them.

Overall this place is a solid 3 but the service definitely takes a star away and while the food is good, it's not 4 star good. I'll return since this place is so close to home and my total dinner bill with tax came to a whopping $24.20, I'm just glad I know what to expect upon going.


Here is the menu translation for the menus located on the walls of the place:

{"text":"This place is as legit as it comes...

I live in North Phoenix near Desert Ridge and I often go down to Mesa to eat at Best Hong Kong on Southern and Dobson.  Now, I hardly go there not because I don't like the food but because I can get another dish with the gas money I save by going to King Wah! 

If you're a fan of bitter melon, ask for a special dish made of bitter melon, beef, and egg.  It's a legit HK dish that not too many restaurants make but King Wah will do it for ya.  :)"}
{"text":"So, I came here after hearing that the fried chicken was phenomenal. The restaurant is kept nice and clean and we were greeted right away upon entering. We sat down right away and was given hot tea and menus. 

For the food we got, everything looks very reasonably priced with hearty portions! We ordered the fried tofu, beef with ginger and onions, Chinese broccoli, and the fried chicken. Wow! I loved all the menu items. Fried tofu was served with a crispy outside and very silky inside. The Chinese broccoli was al dente and the beef was very soft. The fried chicken was crispy and moist and served on a soy sauce sauce and it really was very delicious. 

The walls also had Chinese menu in characters which I think is a sign that this is is a legit place. I like it and will be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese anywhere  quite simply we have never had a bad dish here. Try the duck soup; seriously the best soup in town. The do a fantastic shrimp salad, but you have to per-order. The ambiance is blah, but the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Not a bad place with good prices. The owner is pushy and really sells the Hong Kong fried rice hard. It's good, he is right about that. But he almost doesn't take no for an answer."}
{"text":"Really good food.  We had egg roll, seafood chow fun, and kung pao shrimp.  All very nice temperature, huge portions and fresh ingredients.  Nice service, very attentive and helpful with the menu.  Clean and roomy place with easy parking. Definitely will return.  The sauce on the chow fun was light, plenty of seafood in the dish."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away off 43rd ave in Glendale and...it is well worth the drive. Please look at the pictures here on yelp and order from that (unless you can read chinese) Their house fried rice is by far the best I have ever had and I love their war wonton soup which is my touchstone for any new chinese restaurant I try.
It gets busy on Friday and Saturday so go early or carry out.
I highly recommend this gem to you."}
{"text":"Not bad for what it is. Probably the closest resemblance to real Chinese food in the West Valley that I've had - and no, Panda Express does NOT count as real Chinese food. Decor is lacking and very dull. However, service was not bad by Chinese restaurant standards - she was cordial and friendly with a smile. This is located in a small strip mall and would be easily missed unless you were specifically looking for this. Came in here and ordered a beef chow fun. The noodles were a bit on the thinner side compared to other chow funs that I've had. It did the job in satisfying my craving for chow fun, but it wasn't anything that memorable. I also ordered the fish filet with Chinese vegetables which was actually pretty good. However, the number of fish pieces seemed too few compared to the vegetables themselves. The included white rice was plentiful and more than enough to go with the dish. Prices were within reason - chow fun was about 8 or 9 bucks and the fish was 10ish. Overall, not a bad place to go to if you were stuck in the West Valley and didn't want to make the trek out to Mesa/Chandler for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Can't complain.

If you like authentic Chinese food and are in the area, King Wah is the place to go.

Their roasted duck is absolutely amazing. Oysters and roasted pork were delicious. Everything tastes fresh from the market. The food is reasonably priced. The service is great, they may not speak English too well, but I think that just adds to authenticity of their food. Straight from China. 

I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Sketchy lot? Yes. Great tasting Chinese food? Yes.  There always seem to be a logical pattern when you associate poor or run down area to an above average quality in Chinese restaurants.  Whatever the case maybe, King Wah has been delivering great Hong Kong flavors at a very wallet friendly cost.

It is quite apparent that a good majority of the patrons dining here are of Chinese decent or just Asian! Awesome, I say! That only proves their great reputation of delivering tasteful and desireable Hong Kong-style dishes!

I always order the Family Dinner Set, Letter D! 7 items for $38! You can't beat that! Or maybe you can? I have yet to come across a Chinese joint that offers such a deal!  They do not skimp out on the portion! The two times I have come here, it's been faily consistent!

The one Appetizer dish that comes in that set, called: Fried Bean Cake, is just plain GOOD! Its basically tofu that had been coated and then crisped on the outside while kept very moist and soft inside.  I would order this every time!

Their shark fin and crab soup is pretty darn good too! Peaking Pork Chops! Mm good!

The staff members are very friendly and attentive! They have comfortable booth seatings and round tables for bigger parties.  Also, small tables for smaller groups of four.

Great Wall is still the Valley favorite among the Asian community, but I would rank this place near the top and possibly even with Nee House.  I do not know if they service Dim Sum here.

Enough of me blabbering about this Chinese joint, come check it out and tell me it isn't great! :)"}
{"text":"Used to get delivery from here years ago, but apparently they are now under new ownership and no longer deliver..my other half NEVER wants Chinese so when he agreed I had to take the time to go and pick it up..might not have the chance for Chinese for another 6 months. 

When walking in the interior had changed a bit, new tables, chairs and flooring. Noticed right away it was clean. a polite lady took my order and while I waited a man shelling pea pods made small talk. 

The food only took about 5 minutes and I was on my way. The other half ordered the Mongolian Beef dinner combo (combo comes with chow mein, fried rice, egg roll and a fried won ton.) Ordered sweet & sour chicken for the child and I ordered the Garlic Chicken.

The other halfs beef was wonderful, spicy but not too much, with a decent ratio of meat & green onion, the chow mein on all orders had large pieces of chicken..the egg roll was more like a small spring roll with translucent wrapper, still very tasty.

The low point of the meal was the Garlic Chicken, not enough spice and was more like a bland brown sauce without the garlic kick, not at all like the sauce I am used too.

Overall for $22.00 the meal was worth it and the next time the husband gets a hankering for take out it is going to be 1st on my list."}
{"text":"Sing Hi Chicken maybe one of the best in town. Does not matter what else you order but this is a must.
Place and location is not the best but go for the food. 
Service is generally pretty good and prices are very reasonable"}
