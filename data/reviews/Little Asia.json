{"text":"No more than ordinary to describe the foods I tried three times there. Be careful with their billing! They include 15% \"service charge\" automatically, AND list the suggested tipping scale (15%, 18%, 20%, post-tax)!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in pittsburgh. I really like the taste and the service. Their dumpline is very yummy?and the spicy chilken is very good."}
{"text":"I had fried rice with shrimp. it was just alright. it wasn't unpleasant but I also probably won't come back unless I'm starving and this is the only place without a wait."}
{"text":"Not bad for lunch. It's definitely not high end Chinese but it's also a step above the usual din of fast food-esque Chinese. 

Went there for lunch today and got the Chinese/Japanese bento box with Spicy salmon roll and Beef with Broccoli. For the price, it wasn't bad at all. The Beef with Broccoli was quite tasty (although they use MSG so be sure to ask for it to be left out if, like me, you don't want it). The spicy salmon roll was ok, but not great. They went overboard on the little bits of tempura batter in the roll, to the detriment of putting in enough of the spicy salmon mixture. Still for what it was, a relatively cheap lunch, it hit the spot. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't know why Little Asia only has three stars. I love the food here, way better than the 0-star Lulu's Noodles. Little Asia serve both great fake and authentic Asian food. All their dishes are under $10.00. My favorite ones are (can't post in Chinese for some reason) jiao yan xia, shui zhu niu rou, fu qi fei pian, and hong you yu pian. For the price, Little Asia probably serve the best authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh. Rose Tea tends to be too saucy or salty for me, but Little Asia cooks the food just right. The waitress here are super nice and sweet. The interior is a little weird after they moved. But other than that, I have no complaints. I would pick Little Asia over Lulu's Noodles or Oriental Express anytime. 

Also if you like ice cream, they serve mochi ice cream, which is outrageously delicious."}
{"text":"I continue to end up here sometimes, due to the location. They still have serious service issues. The waitresses and other staff scream viciously at each other in another language, over the heads of customers -- I've witnessed that on two different occasions. They frequently forget drinks and parts of your order. They give up on returning to your table with the check. Once they gave my credit card back to *another* customer. The food is decent but I wish they would fix their other problems because they're a bummer."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The service is terrible. 

You can get MUCH BETTER food and service at other places. 

Don't waste your time and money here. 

If there is 0-star option, i will definitely choose ZERO!"}
{"text":"I totally hate services of this place. Waitresses brought me wrong food twice. Also, after I started eating without complaining on them. They started to gossip me."}
{"text":"The service is terrible: they mischarged a friend, spilled water on me, and brought me the wrong dish. The food is not great, probably because of really low quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I've loved the food from here for years but the staff is horrible and now the food quality has started to decline. The lady who is always working at the front is extremely rude and unprofessional, she will cop an attitude over everything. She had gotten my call in order wrong a few times and the last time I asked why my order cost so much, and if she could repeat what I ordered. She named it off and it was wrong, so I said \"oh no that's not what I ordered\" she then ARGUED with me about it, and got mad at ME because SHE messed up my order. I told her not to worry about it and paid anyway but I will not be going back. Her personality explains why there is no one ever there, I don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Slow _and_ bad; not even particularly cheap.  Not a winning combination for a fast-food place, especially when there's competition just a couple blocks away.

My coworker and I go to Orient Express around the corner on Forbes almost every week; every few months we decide to change it up and go to this place instead.  I usually end up regretting it.

Last time we went we both ordered kung-pao chicken; she got white rice and the crab rangoon, while I had the fried rice and a spring roll.  I will say the fried rice was better than OE; rather than just being some rice that had been fried, it had actual vegetables in it.  However, this was the only upside.

Even during lunch rush, Orient Express is usually quite fast.  This place was incredibly slow; we stood in the door for several minutes before being seated, and it took over 20 minutes from when we ordered until we got our food.  I have been seated and served and nearly finished my meal in less time than Little Asia took to make our food (and didn't have to retrieve my own chopsticks and hot sauce, either).  This could mean that LA's food is fresher than OE's... but it didn't seem to be the case.  The chicken was tough and chewy--as my officemate put it, it was like being served a plateful of trimmings.  The carrots and green peppers were limp, and the only real heat--almost the only flavor--came from the little dried red peppers.  The spring roll was one of the worst I've ever had, greasy and not even particularly hot; the wrapper was so far from crisp it bent when I bit into it.  Even the fortune cookie was stale.

As some others have noted, this place is built into an atrium constructed between the Irish Design Center and Eat Unique buildings.  Unfortunately, most of what this means is during the lunch rush it is not only crowded but very, very loud; it's often quite chilly to boot.

tl;dr:  Less food, less good than Orient Express, and it costs more, too.  Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"The \"braised pork belly over rice\" is the traditional street or night market typical dish in Taiwan.  But the style and flavor in the \"Little Asia\" is totally different than in Taiwan.  It did not taste good.  Dot not try this dish and do not waste your money.

The dried green beans dish is average and it is ok to try it.

The big issue is the tip  - charged me 17% tip for two people with three dishes.  It is not reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this tiny place, they serve better Chinese food than Lulu's (located on the opposite street). Order from the chef's recommendation page on the menu and you won't be sorry. My fav dishes are ma po doufu, pepper squid and fish in chilli oil. Goes great with rice. Just don't order any noodles, beehoon or curry dish. 

Service is good too."}
{"text":"I love this place.  This restaurant is hands down the best chinese place around the CMU / UPitt area.  It's kind of hidden in the middle of Craig street so a lot of people don't know about it but it's pretty amazing.  I always eat here for their cheap, cheap lunch specials ($5.60) - entree, side and rice.

My favorite dishes here are: Black Pepper Steak, the Amazing Chicken and their Pad Thai.

The staff is here is usually super nice too,  All in all, its a pretty great restaurant and definitely beats Lulu's or Oriental Express."}
{"text":"Near to Pitts and CMU. The waitress could speak chinese, that helps a lot to order the meal. The tastes of the dishes are not bad. I would recommend fried rice first, mixed with beef, chicken and shrimps. Dry hot pot shrimps is ok, a little spicy. The restaurateur is nice and give us a card to save five dollars for orders over 35$. I will go back again to try their sushi next time."}
{"text":"Unpleasant experience. The dishes are OK, but one of the waitresses will chase you to the small table impolitely if you have one or two people, so you cannot even choose where to sit. The service is poor!"}
{"text":"Been a fan for a long time but never been spoken to so rudely like I was tonight by the receptionist. The other reviewers were not exaggerating. Couldn't even finish my order. I doubt I'll be back after this."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service waiting for a simple bubble tea to go. Over 10 minutes!  It seems they forgot the order, after getting the payment."}
{"text":"Probably the worst general tsos I've ever had in my life. Crab Rangoon was just cream cheese and nothing else. Boba in the tea was also bad."}
{"text":"Different fancy cuisines and I really enjoy eating in such a fantastic place. The service is also good and I'll recommend all my friends to eat here!"}
{"text":"This is totally subjective, but this is my favourite restaurant and I miss it dearly.  I would only ever get a few things...my favourite being Family Style Tofu.  It's so good.  Crispy, delicious brown savoury sauce, mushrooms and carrots and broccoli.  I usually ate it in two sittings.  I don't think I can find it where I live now and I only hope I can eventually come up with a recipe to what has become my favourite food!

So I've gotten that, and I like the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Soup.  The lemon cakes are also good and a good value I think!  And yeah the lunch specials are good too, with the chicken on a stick!

If I ever get back to Pittsburgh this is the first place I'm going.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is filthy. When I ordered my take-out, the woman didn't even put her cell phone down from her ear to communicate with me."}
{"text":"It is awesome when I dine here. Curry chicken is my favorite. Today I was recommended one new dish they just create. The sauce was pretty awesome, but the shrimp was not that good. Overall, my experience there is good"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh. I went for a quick lunch. Ordered chicken with broccoli (about as basic as you can get) and it came with an egg roll and white rice. The egg roll was the worst I've ever had in my life. Not only was it practically tasteless, but it was cold. The chicken dish was hot (temp wise). That was its only redeeming quality. The sauce seemed bland-ish and very salty. 

I will never be back.

(I had been there a bunch of years back, and the food quality was significantly better. The menu and ownership have both changed.)"}
{"text":"We ordered hot beef noodles, Roast beef with tendons in chili oil, and Chinese pork burger, and they are fantastic,100% authentic Chinese flavor! I promise you would fall in love with the beef noodle,it is !We come here several times a week and were never let down."}
{"text":"One of my two favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! 

I first came with my mom when I started at CMU and naturally we ordered Cantonese dish since we're Cantonese.  The dish was a tofu clay pot with seafood.  It was quite bland and I pegged this place as a bad place. 

And then I rediscovered it.  And man am I glad I rediscovered it!

Stay away from the Cantonese dishes and all their food is fantastic.  

I especially love their spicy boiled beef and their spicy chicken.  

The spicy boiled beef is so flavorful and the meat is just absolutely tender! I have yet to find another restaurant that can make the meat as tender as little Asia for Spicy boiled beef.  

Spicy chicken is sweet tender chicken cooked with spicy green peppers.  I normally don't like chicken but this place makes it great!  I even eat the green peppers and I still think how delicious it is as the peppers run burning down my throat. 

Their set meals for a lower price is cheaper but it doesn't pack the same flavor as ordering from the dinner menu.  Pick anything spicy from this place (especially during those cold cold winter days) and you'll fall in love with this place as much as I did.

Even now back in the bay area with their Asian food galore, I still miss Little Asia!"}
{"text":"This place caters to undergraduates, an audience that, given the inconsistent quality of the food, the cooks do not seem to have a high opinion of. Often done hastily, sloppily, and way too much soy sauce to cover up the lack of seasoning. As someone who grew up with access to good Asian food I may be pickier than most. However, if you are on a limited budget, want a cheap lunch, and don't want another sandwich, this place has you covered. If that is all you need, that is exactly what this place is for. Don't come here for your first date, or to impress your parents from out of town though."}
{"text":"food is good but really really bad service. I went there with my boyfriend and we wanted to sit in a four person table so we can be on the same side. But they rejected and said really insulting words."}
{"text":"I've had sushi here a couple of times and have no complaints.  There is a special at dinner time that if you buy one roll, you get another roll 1/2 off...who can beat that?  I haven't had anything but sushi here though."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so bad that I can't even find even one decent word for it. The cups for water was dirty and the water tasted so weird. The waiter/waitresses kept moving around annoyingly, and yet a service charge was shown on the tab, which I guess is due to the bad service and fear of no tips at all. The chicken still had ice in it, and so not fresh, and the fish smells bad, not to mention it's taste. Ughhhh! I'll never go there again!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while wandering around the CMU campus. An odd location but the lunch was quite delicious with large and perfectly cooked veggies and meat, service was quick and my lunch was a mere $6. What is not to love?"}
{"text":"The food isn't great, neither the service. I have a lunch there with three friends. One of my friends found the bill was miscalculated, it was higher than it should be. Then we went back the restaurant. Actually, they charged us 16% tips without notification, so we double tipped. From their response, feel like this is not the first time the customer caught their \"tricks\". Won't go to the place, EVER!"}
{"text":"I work right by this place and unfortunately get wrangled into having a lunch here from time to time.

For vegetarians, options are extremely limited. Tofu dishes are not vegetarian if you do not eat fish sauce/oyster sauce, etc. What remains is a large plate of overpriced edamame, tea, and forgettable spring rolls, if you are keeping score. A modest sized pot of tea and edamame put me back $7, which just sounds ridiculous to me. 

It seems that you can catch a quick and affordable lunch here if you eat meat and order off of the lunch menu. I think it is usually about $8 for a lunch portion of the entree and crab rangoon. 

Ambiance is very casual and the restaurant is noisy and busy at peak times, but not in an obtrusive way. Service is quick and adequate, but it was hard to convince a waitress to track down information about the sauce ingredients and not just guess based on what they assumed (this happened twice with two different girls)."}
{"text":"Good
yummy  always come here with friends for traditional Chinese food and the service is pretty good for the 3.8$ tips"}
{"text":"I personally like the food here. The meat seems higher quality than Orient Express, and nothing is too greasy or salty. That said, Little Asia's not without its flaws. First, the price. It's Pittsburgh and I'm not trynna drop $12 on dinner most nights. Service is slow and not particularly friendly. They won't adjust orders or meet special requests in my experience. The portions are also extremely meat heavy, as in, 50% meat 50% rice. I really wish they would throw some vegetables in there to mix it up.
But despite these gripes I keep coming back. It's a good location and one of the only 'hot food' spots for a quick dinner on Craig. Love to hate it."}
{"text":"Definitely love their double cooked belly pork. Best of little Asia. Also the bento is a big recommend!"}
{"text":"I like the hotpot wings ???? and shredded potatoes ??????they are tasty.

The restaurant is very unsanitary though. The table is greasy and the waitresses seem really untrained. They sometimes talk really loudly while you are dining as if you don't exist... If it were for those dishes I would never step back into that place."}
{"text":"Close location for cmu and pitt students. The sushi is just okay. I ordered chicken which was good.
But the duck soup? I found 3 or 4 chicken wings in it? I am sure it was chicken because there is also a duck wing in the soup and i could clearly make a difference. I double checked in case it was my mistake but I was disappointed... I dont know whether it was kind of deceiving consumers, but i will not come again"}
{"text":"How does this place only have 2 reviews? My entire department eats here. It's about the best Asian food in walking distance of CMU, but that doesn't really say much. The lo-mien is decent, as is the Hunan and Szechuan plates. I feel like it's easy to get decent Thai food in Pittsburgh, but for some reason Little Asia screws it up, so stick with the Chinese dishes.
And if it matters, their fortune cookies only spout proverbs, not fortunes."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is bad. It often takes 20-40mins for them to serve my order. Would recommend ordering 30mins ahead of time"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese and fast! Tastes fresh and not like mall Chinese food. Lunch specials with tea for around $5."}
{"text":"Everything is overpriced. Waitress always complains about tips when you don't give 15%. Most of the time I went to have lunch there with my friends who will give more after the waitress complains. But, the services they provide does not worth 15%."}
{"text":"Went there again for lunch today. Ordered some shrimps. It cost me 16 dollars with only seven or eight shrimps. Just saw same dish picture from other restaurants, quite different. So I am really angry now."}
{"text":"To be honest, taste is ok. But their service is sooooo bad:( waited for more than 40 mins in front of a empty table in a not a busy time? Forget my order but No explanation or apologize. The attitude of their waitress is not good."}
{"text":"Still a fan, just need to put it out there that the dancing dragon roll is not so great :( BUT I still love Little Asia."}
{"text":"This place looks so sketchy on the exterior, but it was pretty clean, bright and spacious inside. Another one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" moment. The menu has tons of selections, ranging from sushi to pad thai. I really like the natural lighting that the restaurant utilizes. The service was very disappointing though. The waitress that we had was impatient and rude. Gratitude was pre-added to the bill, so I wonder if that was the reason why she was a bit inconsiderate. 

I had the chance to try the tuna lover roll and the special roll. Both were average and acceptable, but not exceptional. The sacha beef dish was uninteresting with this weak soy sauce seasoning. Again, this is your typical greasy Asian stir-fried dish. The one menu item that really stood out to me was the pad thai. I thought the pad thai was delicious with a mild peanut sauce that was refreshingly flavorful with a tad of sweetness. However, it was kind of ridiculous that they charged a dollar extra to have tofu instead of meat. But I thought tofu is technically cheaper? 

Overall, the food at Little Asia was average and the service was disappointing. Prices aren't too bad and the portion was satisfying, but not a place that I'll go out of my way to get to. The service was so off-putting that I will probably not return here again."}
{"text":"Little Asia does offer some more authentic Chinese items, however I haven't found my favorite yet.  All the dishes tend to be super greasy."}
{"text":"Ordered food here for the first time tonight. They made my food extremely quickly. I ordered chicken and broccoli with white rice and an egg roll. I will order from here again for sure. Not sure about the other comments because everyone was nice."}
{"text":"It used to be good, may be. Yesterday we went and ordered three different dishes and none were good. The service was also below average and the portion was also small."}
{"text":"This place is near Pitts and CMU, so the location is very convenient for students. I had been here for a dinner, and I ordered black pepper beef. I think the price of dinner dishes is pretty high, compared to the lunch specials. And the flavor is just on average level, since the black peper seasoning is uninteresting. The service is slow after I made my order, it took me 15 minutes to wait for my dish. Also, I spent another 10 minutes to wait for my payment. In light of the poor service quality and the expensive price tag, I will probably not return here again."}
{"text":"This place is your typical run of the mill Asian restaurant. I came here along with a group of others and ordered five different dishes, including the mapo tofu, chili pot beef, dry hot chicken, shredded potato with green chili, and one other dish that I can't recall. As for the quality of the food, the mapo tofu was alright. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be, considering that it's a Szechuan Chinese dish, but then again my spice tolerance level is quite high (I was raised that way). The shredded potato with green chili and chili pot beef were acceptable. There really wasn't a spice factor for any of these dishes as well, even though it was advertised to be spicy. As for the dry hot chicken, I found it to be a bit on the dry side ... most likely due to overcooking. Unfortunately, this dish ended up coming out dead last ... literally way after our group had finished devouring the other dishes. Not sure why this dish took particularly so long, but I found the timing between this dish and the other four to be greatly exaggerated. Was not particularly pleased at this, seeing as this was one of the main dishes ordered that I was actually looking forward to the most.
In the end, the prices here are on the slightly higher side in comparison to some of the other Asian restaurants around on Craig ... would probably only come here when friends are in town. It's not a place that I would normally visit for Asian cuisine as there are better options around & elsewhere"}
{"text":"been back a few times for dinner and it's quite good!

their spicy beef tendon is great."}
{"text":"Acceptable Asian foods. Their sushi is more authentic than other dishes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. ???????????BTW, the lady M cake is bogus. Don't be fooled. Note: you may see some Chinese eating there. That is not because Chinese love those craps. Only reason is that sometimes poor Carnegie Mellon students are too hungry. Craps are better than none."}
{"text":"This is passable Chinese food and sushi.  It is convenient to the CMU campus but often quite crowded and the layout such that it is difficult to navigate.  The service can be slow and the prices are high for moderate quality food."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Chinese restaurant within walkable distance from CMU, as it is down the street on Craig Street.  The interior is kinda strange because it's adjacent to a store (you can see through the windows) and the kitchen is like in a weird corner.  The seats aren't particularly comfortable either, but that's okay.  The wait staff is pretty nice.

Go here for their $5.60 lunch specials that include favorites like chicken and broccoli, black pepper steak (my favorite one).  The portions are a bit small, but not bad.  They do have a tendency to drown food in sauce, though."}
{"text":"it's no where near the Chinese restaurants in squirrel hill area. The only thing I actually liked in this place so far is gen tso's chicken, which is pretty sad considering this is not even an authentic Chinese dish. The noodles are also ok if your have a craving. Their lunch specials seem to be really cheap so I might try something else in the future."}
{"text":"This place is really good for large groups. Their serving sizes are pretty big so you should go for family-style meals. They have a wide variety of dishes - ranging from basic sesame chicken to more authentic Sichuan fish fillet stew. Definitely would recommend green beans even though paying $10.95 for greens seems meh!  Hunan chicken was not that good also."}
{"text":"the food is straight up gross.  i hate to say this, as a foodie i feel like i should ahve something better.  want chicken?  hope you like under cooked dark meat.  like tofu?  hope you like tofu mush with mystery slime on top.

i wanted to love this place, but it's just gross.  two star bc the staff is so nice, their sushi menu if you are brave enough gets a solid 'meh,' and the staff is so nice."}
{"text":"I've tasted few of their dish here and there but never sat down to order a full meal until this past weekend.

Personally, I think their foods are less westernized compared to Lulus or other asian restaurants around the area. However, you might not find out the difference if you order common items like the General Tso.

We were a group of around 12 - so there was a lot variety when it came to our palette. We ordered few different kinds of sushi, Chilli Chicken, Singaporean noodles, cold spicy noodles, Chili Pork Hot Pot, Beans and yes General Tso. The crowd favorite was the Chilli Pork Hot Pot and the Chilli Chicken. The spice level are pretty spicy - so you might want them to tone down if you can't handle the spicy food.

The portions are pretty huge for the price which is very reasonable. All the dish we had was really good. The service... was err.. good since my Lady happen to be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Language barrier
Cheap ingredients
Poor service
Inconsistent food experience

The orange chicken was awesome the first time I came, the second, it was alright but my companions got horrendous food.
Entrees were forgotten, food was cold.
Not coming back. Period."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in an odd location on Craig Street. It's a neat looking brick building, with a store directly connected to the restaurant. I came here with a group of friends because Lulu's was packed. The place had free seating during the Saturday night dinner rush, which is probably attributed to its obscure location.

We ordered the teriyaki chicken, General Tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and black pepper steak to share amongst our table. All of the food was good. The meat in each entree were tender, and the General Tso's actually had good cuts of chicken, contrasted to some restaurants who I believe just cut out whole chunks. The black pepper steak was definitely my favorite.

All of the dishes were tasty and well priced (under $10). The food didn't blow me away, but it's quite good. Our waiter didn't check on us during our meal, so I had to request a refill of my drink, but besides that the service was fine.

A short distance from CMU and U Pitt, this restaurant is a good place to go for inexpensive Chinese food."}
{"text":"Before Little Asia changed ownership it was amazing, however, things are different. The service, which used to be top notch, is now abysmal. The food, while still being pretty good, isn't nearly as good as it used to be. They changed their supplier, or changed the type of ingredients they use.  Either way it is to their detriment. This used to be my favorite place to get Asian fare and I'm saddened to say I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"My wife refers to this place as crappy sushi, but she does so in the most endearing way, and she secretly loves it. This place isn't so much a restaurant as it is a place to eat in a foyer of a building.  Little Asia caters to the undergraduate population at CMU.  The asian to other people ratio is always very high when we eat there. It can't be that bad right?  Last night, we were the only non-asians in the foyer, I mean restaurant.

There is a pretty decent Chinese menu but I have only had a few dishes on it. I go there for the americanized sushi. Now, let me be clear, I love really good sushi and have had it in some of the best restaurants in the US and in Pittsburgh. Frankly, I can't always afford that. So enter \"Little Asia\". Hand rolls, are buy 1 get one 1/2 off and are pretty standard american sushi.  Everything is always made to order and the fish always seems fresh. I will say the rice in the rolls can vary from chef to chef but it works.  I typically order the super sashimi bento box which includes miso soup, salad, a few pieces of sashimi and a hand roll. I think it is a hidden gem on the menu.

As for the service,  it is always very attentive, but I will warn that the staff speak limited english. So ordering is usually a combination of pantomime, pointing and pictionary."}
{"text":"I don't understand why my classmates love coming to this place.  It's cheap Chinese food that is not good.  Their beef is kinda funny in texture/taste.  Their General Tso's chicken is soggy and super fat and has an iron taste to it.  Place is kinda stuffy.

If it weren't for my classmates, I would not visit this place."}
{"text":"Better than your average Pittsburgh Chinese food. The fish fillet hot pot was pretty good especially with the bamboo shoots and some other veggies in it. The lamb was tender. I'd like to try their Chinese burgers next time."}
{"text":"Not bad, and seems to be a good place for students. Very standard sushi. Prices are affordable and the lunch specials are a good deal."}
{"text":"Their 'Amazing Chicken' is actually pretty amazing, it's definitely better than their General Tso's, cause it has softer meat."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and will not be back. It's way expensive for the not-so-authentic food. I ordered a \"dry mushroom with shredded beef\" @ $12.95. It should have been called \"big chunks of onions, celery, bamboo shoots with hidden mushroom and some beef\". The taste is standard Americanized Chinese fast food. For the lunch of  $13 plus tip, I was neither full or satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was good here. Hot and fresh. Prices were good too. That being said the crab ragoons were empty. The place is clean also. The staff as with most little Chinese places is not the friendliest people. But I would defiantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Better than average Chinese take-out food and way better than OE (Oriental Express) which is the epitome of American-ized Chinese food. Order from the Chinese Specialties if you want something better than American-ized Chinese food. The menu written in Chinese on the black board in the entrance are has less American-ized dishes.

Very convenient and close to CMU. They also have a small bubble tea stand in the corner. This place is cheap and good for quick meal if I don't want to go all the way to Squirrel Hill to Rose Tea, etc."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese. 

But it's cheap, quick and right by my house. Plus, they stay open late. 

House special lo mien isn't bad. Neither is the General Tsao chicken."}
{"text":"These ppl are so rude to students who doesn't speak their language.

I ordered to go but sat down instead. They told me I could not sit bc I ordered to go. Yes, threw a paying customer out. We are paying good $ to eat this deep fried crap.

I left a nice little siracha/ soy sauce mess on the table for them :). Learn some respect!"}
{"text":"The reason I'm not giving Little Asia more stars is because I've had some pretty bad food here over the past few years. I had decided I wouldn't come back but my friend (who lived in China) said that I had to try the Chinese sandwiches. 

She was right! The chinese sandwiches are amazing. My other friend suggested the steamed buns, which were amazing too. I guess this place is very hit or miss. If you go, try to order recommended items and you should be good."}
{"text":"The previous ownership was a lot better than the current one. The food and service was a lot better. I had to eat there twice today because everywhere else was closed. I wasn't too pleased with the service so I tipped a little lower than usual. As I left the restaurant, the disgruntled waitress called me and demanded I pay more. She got really rude and told me to order takeout in the future. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive and BIG quantities!!
Most of the food is good.

What else would a student need?
And, yes it's on Craig! For the CMU people!"}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced! The food taste OK though. There is a 15% service fee included in the bill (for just two people!) Usually I will pay a 15% tip but that should not be \"set and required\" by the bill. By the way, I ordered one veggie and one meat dish. It costed over $40. Please don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Clean - it was clean (smelled like cleaning products) got bourbon chicken and fried rice - chicken was not bourbon chicken and the fried rice had no egg or anything else in it and was hard.  Cheap and clean is all I can say..."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets so many bad reviews.

The authentic Sichuan menu is pretty decent. You won't get mind-blowing Spicy Boiled Fish for example, but it's definitely tasty. They have a pretty complete menu, and you'll have an opportunity good amount of variety every time you go.

Admittedly though, their food lies more on the wet side, which means they don't make crispy things as crispy as they should, and when they fry some of their veggies, it comes out to tasting steamed rather than stir-fried. For example, the string beans I ordered, some beans were crunchy but most were soggy.

The food is tasty, and to reiterate that point, some dishes I've ordered, such as the cumin lamb and beef noodle soup all have good all around flavor and an okay amount of spicy. 

The foods I would watch out for are the non-Sichuan dishes, namely the Cantonese style dishes that come out to be really bland and miss the mark.

Boba was also decent, so I'll give that a plus too. Overall, decent restaurant for semi-authentic Sichuan cuisine."}
{"text":"Nope.

Just...no.

Slow service, inconsistency in dishes, sometimes lukewarm food, pervasive blandness, and ingredients that have been sitting out too long are what await potential patrons standing awkwardly in the doorway unsure of when and where to sit.  Given the sloppiness evident from a seat in the dining room (so to speak), I don't even want to know what other rules of running a decent restaurant are routinely ignored in that kitchen.

Simply put: Forget taste, I don't trust the kitchen here not to make me sick.

I'll be a happy Oakland resident when this place closes and something else moves in.  Right now it's just taking up space."}
{"text":"The location was close, I didn't feel like driving somewhere to get lunch so we ordered pick up. 

First of all, they took a really long time getting our order and gave us some free soda which was really considerate.  It wasn't until we got back that we realized that they got our order wrong. No side of rice, no chicken on a stick, not the right kind of sushi. 

Another thing to note, their sushi here is not the greatest, but edible.  

After all this...I'd probably come here again, I'm really not too picky with American Chinese food (but i recognize mediocre food) and it's the nearest Asian restaurant. I think they have a lot to work on but I they'll make it."}
{"text":"Great Kung Pao chicken! Nice cheap $6.50 Chinese lunch specials, but the test of the menu is great too. Their sushi is okay, quite healthy like much of what they serve, but kind of bland. Difficult to understand the servers but they're friendly enough."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered a sushi combo. They have a combination of chinese dishes and a sushi menu but I haven't tried their chinese yet.  The sushi was decent and reasonably priced, but the quality of the fish wasn't that great with some of the tougher portions of the fish included in the cut, though it was adequate/edible.  Service really fast to get you seated and get your food, but minimal attention after that.  It gets crowded and tables are really close together.  They also get picky about where you sit and won't let 2 people sit at a 4 person table, etc."}
{"text":"The spicy pot of chicken wing was pretty good and they served warm water!!!!
The volcano roll was also pretty good and it has a crispy cover, which really increase the eating experience of this food.
A good eating experience, my first meal in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I come here for the food, not the service. In terms of genuine Chinese food, this place creates some pretty satisfying dishes. I've been here twice and both times I've walked out with a full belly and leftovers for the next day. My only criticism in terms of the food is that it's a bit overpriced. I ordered the $16.95 braised pork with pickled veggies and $12.95 fish fillet with soup. Unfortunately the soup did not come with rice so that was an additional $3 for another bowl of rice. So expensive! 

The dishes themselves were full of flavor. The soup is translated from Chinese loosely as bitter vegetable and fish soup, so it lived up to its name. The pork was very fatty and salty, pairing well with the rice. It melted in my mouth. 

In terms of service, Little Asia is very lacking. My friend and I were placed in the side alley at a level lower than the main serving area, near the takeout window. The servers couldn't even see that area! Only one waiter serviced the strange side space and even he didn't come much. We had to call someone over to take our order and stand up and walk over to the main area to hand them our check. One woman even mistakenly gave us a takeout order when we were waiting for our dishes. It was quite surprising being handed to go when we expected a sit down meal. I felt even worse for the large groups that had to sit further down this weird alley and up some stairs to some spare space behind the rest of the office complex and adjacent restaurant's, Eat Unique's, kitchen. They were completely out of sight and almost forgotten.

I have also seen some Yelp reviews criticizing the sushi here and I just wanted to say that it's a Chinese restaurant, so don't order the sushi! I would come back for their lunch specials, I think that's when the menu items are most worth their value. Don't come expecting hospitality! Come to eat."}
{"text":"I usually love service at the Chinese restaurants but this place is very weird! I will NEVER go here! People who are serving here are SOOO rude to people who don't speak chinese. Man, it was a horrible experience. I didn't understand something on Menu and the waitress has no patience and was so impolite without even helping. On top of that food is NOT good too. There are bunch of other places near by and i can go there. But highly recommend you not to go to this place if you are not a Chinese. You will end up like me."}
{"text":"The restaurant is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. We always come here for lunch. Everyone here is super nice. The spicy chicken is the taste of home!"}
{"text":"My experience with Little Asia was with delivery on Thanksgiving - so I will acknowledge, it's a busy day for them. We had ordered through Uber Eats and watched patiently as the counter ticked down until our order was ready... a few minutes later, cancelled. WHAT? We thought Uber had been the problem so we called to check - they said our food was ready. So let them know we were on our way and not to give our food away... upon arrival we realized only half of our order had been prepared and the driver probably realized with how busy it was it wasn't going to be the full order anytime soon. After waiting about 10 minutes we decided to just take the half that was ready, but just then they came around the corner with the final items. So coordination / service - unfortunately  that'd be somewhere between a 1 - 2 star review.

The food was tasty, although the rolls we ordered were not to have seafood in them and they were filled with shrimp... bummer.

Long story short, I think this may be more of an eat-in place... or at least not order take out on a super busy day. Maybe next year we'll give them another shot but plan to eat there."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Pittsburgh!
Chilli chicken, garlic chicken, lo mein, chilli pot, fish in hot oil... all of these are best I have eaten in Pittsburgh. 
I have always received good service here. I am a regular here."}
{"text":"I personally know someone who has seen their kitchen and back room.  I trust this person very, very much and I can safely say without fear of exaggeration to not eat there.  

That said, before I found out what I found out, I did eat here and neither the service nor the food was that good.  Sure, the portions were big, but the server forgot to bring a part of our order and the taste was bland and generic."}
{"text":"So this place is located right between the Irish Cultural Design Center and Eat Unique.  It sits in the middle of this little courtyard.  It's a little odd.  You feel like you're eating outside but you're inside.  

It's fast and the lunch specials are good.  For $18 we ordered General Tsao's Tofu and the vegetarian special (avocado roll, green roll, sweet potato roll, white rice, and miso soup).  The service was okay ... by that I mean we had to ask for small plates (since we were sharing) but we only got one and had to specify afterwards we each wanted a plate.  Then when the sushi came out the waitress only brought one set of chopsticks.  Common sense, anyone?  The quality of food itself was a little inconsistent.  General Tsao's Tofu was good and the sweet potato roll was pretty amazing.  The rest of it... I wouldn't come back for.

If you work in the area I'd recommend checking it out on your lunch hour.  If you don't work in the area then I don't recommend going just because the parking is tough in the area and I don't think the food is worth the hassle.

They also offer take out and credit card is available only for $10+ orders."}
{"text":"This is an okay place. Food is decent, but a little on the greasy side. Sometimes they add a builtin gratuity, sometimes not. It could get expensive for small groups, but not too bad. 
Their boba also tastes insanely sweet, so I wouldnt go for it."}
{"text":"I have ordered Hun Tun, dumplings and beef noodle. The experience is quite lame. The Hun Tun is a disaster. The skin is very thick. The chicken meat in Hun Tun is not only wired (usually Hun Tun is served with shrimp or meat with vegetables) , but also extremely dry and tasteless. The beef noodle is spicy in a strange way, and the soup is sweet and so much that dilute all the other ingredients. The dumpling is OK, but a little bit too sweet.

The service is not bad comparing to the lame food. But the food is worse than Lulu's noodle and orient express while costing more than the restaurant above."}
{"text":"Cheap. Get the teriyaki chicken on the lunch menu, but get it spicy. It's decent.

Like the new sushi bar. Decent chinese if you're around CMU and need a cheap lunch"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but don't try kongpao chicken, it's nothing like the REAL Chinese kongpao chicken."}
{"text":"The sushi bar, their recent addition in their menus, seems to bring more people in this place, which is good for their business. But the downside is that everything got SUPER SLOW. I went there at around noon and had to wait FOREVER for my foods, it was more than 30 min. I don't think it's acceptable by any standard! They seriously need to learn how to streamline their services, or if not, hire more cooks, more servers. And, why the hell do they speak Chinese to non-Chinese people? Please do speak English.

On top of that, the worst part is that THEY CHARGED SOMEONE ELSE'S TABLE TO MY CARD AND GAVE MY CARD TO THAT PERSON AND GOT ME THAT PERSON'S CARD BACK AFTER PAYMENT. Luckily I checked my bank account the next morning and found out right away there were TWO transactions from Little Asia and the one I didn't recognize. It turned out they accidentally swiped my card for that other table and gave my card to that person who used it later that day without knowing it's not his or hers. They made a horribly stupid mistake of mixing the two customers' cards up. How lame!"}
{"text":"The food isn't great and the service isn't either. Especially when you compare to places like OE and Lulus that give you more food of the same quality for less money, there just really isn't a reason to come here.

The few times I've been here the service was really slow. We were seated right away but then we had to wait some time to get our food despite the fact that the place was half empty. The staff also seemed rather unhappy in general.

I've gotten the pad thai and orange chicken and while they are good, the taste was comparable to OE (at least the orange chicken) and you get less food. My biggest food complaint is the sushi - and I actually docked one star for this. The last time I came here I got the bento box, and while it was well presented, something tasted off. I spent almost that entire night throwing up and looking back this was the only thing I had eaten that day that would have caused this. DO NOT GET THE BENTO BOX.

I will not be coming back. There are better options in the area."}
{"text":"One of the worst Asian places in Pittsburgh. They have had health code violations in the past - a huge issue, especially for a restaurant serving sushi. The staff is not helpful and frequently is rude upon taking orders. With so many other great Asian places nearby, there is no reason to visit this one!"}
{"text":"it is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. healthy and yummy? i have the pork sandwich and spicy fish best? its so classic just like in china?"}
{"text":"worst service. We waited for 40 minutes for nothing except a drink. And the waitress told us others were still waiting even they came ealier than us. Actually another table got the same dishes we ordered much earlier and they just came in for 10 minutes. The servants there were so rude tho some dishes were good. Go there if you can bear the service."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is good, but the price is a little high. When I called and ordered takeout, the waitress often gave me the wrong dish. The good part was when we complained, sometimes we got a free soda. Generally a convenient place for a workday lunch or dinner. But I won't come everyday if there were good alternatives nearby."}
