{"text":"I stumbled onto this restaurant/bar by accident.  A go-to spot when in Cleveland and one of the best places ever.  Sad to think it's not there anymore."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I was last at Za Za.  I really want to like this place, as it has some elements that are sorely missing from most Cleveland establishments, but there must be some reason I do not find myself returning to this place.  The cocktails were decent, as was the food.  There just is not anything that especially stands out about this place, and for the prices paid, I think that is the real problem here.  They do have live music, and it is usually pretty decent Jazz.  This is probably the biggest draw: a somewhat hip establishment with pretty good music and no cover.  It is no Nighttown, of course, but it's good for a restaurant stuck in such an ugly strip mall.    Maybe this place could move into the new shopping center being built across the way and benefit from the traffic and crowd the new Whole Foods will bring.  That could help."}
{"text":"This place can be pricey, but they do have ladies nights on wednesdays, and other drink specials sometimes. The food is definitely good. I like the variety and they must have 100+ martini's on the menu, but the tab does add up fast (last time I believe we spent well over $200). The calamari is great but they burgers were a little dry, although when we complained they took the burger off our bill.   The atmosphere here is kind of like a jazz nightclub, or how I would imagine one to be. Sometimes live music can be a bit loud, so try to get a table near the back if possible. It's different than what you find at most bars, so worth a return tip. Feels like a dressy place but people do wear jeans there. Very close to the university but it is more of a place for grad students than undergrads."}
