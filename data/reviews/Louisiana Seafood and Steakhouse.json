{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time and Ordered filet Mingnon and Lobster. Ended up  very dissapointed as it wasn't 8 oz and the lobster as stated was 3oz. Discussed it with our waitress to confirm that my steak didn't look 8 oz. She brought it to her managers attention and he came to the table twice saying he'll see what he can do for me. He asked if he can get me a shot of alcohol, or something else. The food was sub par for the price. You are honestly better going to the keg for size and taste. It's too bad to say this. In the end he kept saying he's so sorry and gave 5 dollars of my meal, and a 2 for 1 coupon which I kindly gave back. I was amazed at the customer service skills of this manager. The service in the kitchen was so slow - waited over an hour, and it really was not that busy for a Saturday night. I can say we won't be going back.
I'll definitely will go to the keg,  where I know they pride themselves with exceptional customer service and quality food for their prices."}
{"text":"Poor service. Frozen seafood.. Spoiled oysters served.. Not worth writing any more than this.. Stay away from this place. You're better off waiting 45 minutes for a table at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Ok, we saw the reviews and said we would still give them a try. I must also say say that I am from Florida and have had numerous experiences with southern/seafood cuisine. This ain't it.

We ordered the frog legs as a appetizer and I must say that the batter was tasty. The shrimp cargot was also tasty. However, this is when things took a turn.

I must validate that if you are in a hurry you might want to choose somewhere else. Service is slow but I must say we had a friendly and informed waitress.

We ordered the Stuffed Salmon, Chicken wraps, Arotto Chicken, and the Fish and chips. We were not impressed.

The Salmon was good but the rice had no flavor. The chicken wraps were alright but not too flavourful. The Arotto chicken was heavy on the pepper and the fish and chips was very bland. 

To top it off it is pretty pricey. This totalled $125....not worth it.
 
I wanted to give a better review but in good conscience can't. I will not return."}
{"text":"Saw this Groupon and was in the neighborhood so I thought I would try it out...bad move.

Waitress was on the rude side.  Seemed like she didn't want to be there.  Spoke quickly and did not make us feel welcome at all.  However as the night progressed she seemed to get better and by the end she was smiling...maybe cuz she didn't have to serve us anymore????

For Groupon goers its a different menu than the regular one.  Food did not have that \"Louisiana\" taste/feel to it.  Mussels were small and didn't get a lot.  The scallops in my pasta were frozen, not fresh....or maybe it was shrimp?  Idk..I think I've blocked the experience from my mind :S

For a place with \"Seafood\" in the name I thought I would be getting a better seafood experience or at the very least a Louisiana tasting.  The whole ordeal was prolonged by the SUPER SLOW staff and cooks.  I was there for may be 2 hours??

Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Is there a 0 star?? Where do I even begin. I called numerous times to make reservations and nobody ever picked up. The only reason why we went to this place was there were good ratings on groupon. We ended up getting the voucher from livingsocial instead bc they had a better deal. 120 bucks worth of food for 60 dollars. It did not say anything about a specific menu like for groupon. When we got there .. near empty restaurant.  They didn't even know about the livingsocial deal when we brought it up.. and it took like over 20 mins to get it settled because apparently it was i correctly advertised but seriously it was not our problem. The waitress then got our orders wrong. Then Two plates out of the four was cold.  We got two mains of fillet mignon with lobster tail and the lobster and shrimp mains. Each lobster and shrimp dish came with two lobster tail yet only one was plated for each dish and the rest had to come after. The mashed potatoes were not even real... they were the powdered ones u buy from grocery store. The food tasted ok but nothing special and certainly not worth 35 bucks per plate... ESP when they were served cold. We tipped but we deff shouldn't."}
{"text":"Why isn't there an option to give zero stars?

Fish tasted frozen and horrible 
 
Gumbo had shrimp that were smaller than salad shrimp almost no chicken

Rice tasted like leftover rice a roni

Server was not attentive

2 of 4 dishes sent back one intolerable.

How do you complain to get a comp for horrible food when your meal is prepaid by groupon?? If we came here and didn't have a groupon we would have walked out without paying as soon as the apps came out.

Worst restaurant I've been to in Toronto ever.
Disgusting and shameful"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend because I bought a groupon and the menu selection looked amazing.  I only wish that I looked at the reviews before buying it.  I am giving it 2 stars because our server Tara was great.  

The place is quite nice looking, but nothing about it screams Louisiana.  

We started with the Shrimp Cargot and the Calamari.  The Shrimp was actually pretty good - which unfortunately set the wrong expectations for the rest of the meal.  The Calamari was frozen and just not good at all.  

For our entrees we got the Blackened Catfish with mashed potatoes and the shrimp and lobster linguine.  My pasta was okay, but nothing special.  Had I not known that there was lobster in it, I would have been none the wiser.  The catfish was also frozen.  It was a teeny piece of fish and it was definitely not \"blackened\".  My boyfriend said that the best part of his meal was the powdered mashed potatoes.  

For desert we got the brownie cheesecake and tiramisu which both obviously came out of a box.  

I really wanted to like this place but I really did not.  There is no chance I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is my exact email to the website when no one care to come back to me a week after I have spoken to the management to report that I had suffered diarrhea and stomach Pain after dining at the restaurant: 

To the Management,

I have spoken to John Para on December 29, 2015 to report a food poisoning that I and my friend when we dine in on December 27, 2015 ( reference check # 117033) we have a couple of pictures what he have eaten that night.  I had suffered diarrhea and stomach pain for two days after eliminating all possible source of bad food I have consumed. I have also learned from my friend that dined with me and my family that she also suffered the same. We have eaten same dessert on the night of Dec 27, 2015 at Louisiana Steak and Seafood located on Steeles Ave West and Hurontario St in Brampton. I have waited to hear from John  until Jan 3. I have called again and spoke to Viki, our server on Dec 27. She told me that she didn't not get any message or notification from the management about my food poisoning report and denied that there were any other complaints were received from other customer that night. I remembered only 4 of us and another 6 people behind us were at the restaurant. I also told her that even my son whom I shared a small part of my cheesecake had a couple of watery bowel for the first day. My case was more severe for I have a day of diarrhea and painful stomach until the second day. I was not able to go to work those days. I have only consumed juice, banana and oatmeal. The worst that I was not  expecting from Viki is being laughed at my report instead of showing some sympathy. I asked her why she was laughing? Was there any funny thing about was I was telling her? I told her that aside from not receiving any apology from the management, she was laughing about it? I told her I am calling because I want the restaurant to be careful of how they handle and store the food. Cheese cake is made of milk, need to be always be refrigerated on the right temperature so other customer won't suffer the same sickness I did. I have once have s sushi business and also a certified food handler trained in California. I know that that cheesecake was handled and stored wrong. I bought 4 vouchers from Groupon for $109 each for our other friends. I have shared my experience to a group of friends that will be dining there next week. Because of food poisoning that I had experience I had decided not to join them. I am looking forward that this issue will not be overlook. I am very disappointed, I love to dine out and have eaten a lot in so many restaurants and have never experience any food poisoning nor received a bad customer service. I am now thinking of a reason why your restaurant has to sell thru groupons for such a long period of time."}
{"text":"I normally do not give bad reviews. But this restaurant deserves it. Came here with a group of friends and redeemed our Groupon. 

First impressions was that there was literally 10 people in the restaurant, a lot of empty tables. I already knew this was going to be bad. But I wanted to give it a shot.

We order from the prix fixe menu - 3 course meal. Appetizers we're ok, nothing extraordinary. They were cooked properly and had an ok presentation.

We receive our entrees and this is where it goes downhill.  My gf ordered the angus steak and it was \"cold\" (it seemed as if it was sitting for 20 mins before it reached our table). I didn't complain since I never trust food going back to the kitchen especially at this kind of place. I ordered the ribs and it arrived somewhat cold. My friend ordered Caesar Salad and the lettuce had a slight tint of red (I'm not sure if these people prepare blindly or not). But you should know that you never serve lettuce that's bad. 

The only thing that could save this whole experience was the chocolate brownie dessert. TBH, it was actually really good (if you love chocolate and cheesecake). 

Overall, I would avoid this restaurant like the plague. If your into steak, I would recommend milestones or joeys or Wildfire steakhouse North York (Best service and food)."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve one star. Literally the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. I redeemed a groupon and regretted it. I could have spent that money  at Mcdonalds or any local fast food joint for a better meal ( at least they serve their food hot). Heres how the dinner went: 

Walked in,and the place looked pretty bad but decided to give it a try either way. We received our prix fix menu. the appetizers were not that great but it was the entrees that were HORRIBLE. My boyfriend and I both ordered steaks and both of our steaks were COLD. We took about two bites and couldn't even finish the rest. It was actually quite embarrassing for us to tell the waitress that we were done especially because our plates looked untouched. The only good part about this place is the dessert that we got which was a strawberry cheesecake. 

My advice is: SAVE YOUR MONEY and go somewhere else where you can actually have a nice EDIBLE meal."}
{"text":"If you are in the neighborhood, skip this place and just head for Red Lobster.
Prices are similiar and food tastes better.
Interior layout was odd, bathrooms were gross and the place is falling apart.
Serving staff was ok but I will not go there again."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because the manager made an exception and allowed us to order an item that wasn't part of the groupon. The food was edible but not good. If the decor doesn't disgust you (because it's about 50 years old and literally ripping) then the food bits on the walls will, which are also encrusted on. 
Save your money or go to the Keg. At least you know there's no gross food bits on the walls."}
{"text":"I went there last year as they had a groupon deal. We made reservation, so we were seated right away, however it was not too busy anyway. My friend was asking what beer they had on tap, the waitress listed a couple of beers and he questioned what kind it was, she did not know what he meant. So we asked, is it a logger or ...? She kept on repeating the name of the beer. She did not seem to know that there are different kind of beer. Strange for being a waitress. 

And then, as she was taking our dirty plates away, my dirty fork fell on me and of course I was wearing white. It wasn't too much of a deal but my friend asked \"Are you okay\" and funny enough the waitress answered \"yes\". She did not even apologized and did not bring more napkins until 10-15 mins later.

The food was just okay. Nothing spectacular. Service was generally slow. I only bought the groupon because I saw 1000+ people who bought the groupon and I assumed it would be excellent. I guess I should have made more in-depth research.

I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Darn, I really don't like being the one to lower a businesses star rating however upon visiting Louisiana Seafood and Steakhouse last night I felt it necessary to comment on a few things both good and other... 

I'm not super familiar with traditional Louisiana style cuisine but from the get-go a few items felt off in terms of preparation and quality. Now there was nothing that upset me, our group had a great time but i think the majority of my issue came from several food items AND the service.

Here are some quick points on things that I did enjoy:

 - Stone Hammer (from Guelph) is the house beer and I greatly enjoyed my pint
 - The location is easy to find and provides large portion sizes, tons of parking and apparently WiFi

For food I ordered an array of appetizers for our group to try so we could share family style, listed below are the apps we added and my thoughts on each:

- Deep fried calamari: nicely seasoned, dipping sauce was pretty tasty (chipotle?), howvever couldn't be sure on freshness

- Frog legs: I researched and apparently these should be separated, however ours were served in pairs so it literally still resembled the lower half of a frog. They were deep fried but I felt they were mushy and tasted off. I'm no expert, but something was off...

- Whole crawfish: Considering that our server brought us eating instructions ripped from the back of a box of frozen Crawfish, it's safe to say these were not fresh. However the seasoning (butter sauce and cajun spice) were delicious and frozen or not these were tasty

- Fresh Malpeque large oysters: Served well, and seemed to be fresh (didn't get sick from them). I enjoyed this

The purpose for our trip was to try their alligator, but apparently there is some sort of issue getting the meat across the boarder and they've been sold out for quite some time (sad). But with the assortment of apps, we didn't miss the gator too much.

For the main course I had the New Orleans jambalaya. Now this is one dish that I've had numerous times before and this dish fell well short of my standards. Essentially I was given a large bowl of rice and tomato sauce. The three key elements of Jambalaya (Andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken) were either scarce or non-existent.. boo! I received 3 very tiny shrimp, a few shreds of chicken and not one piece of sausage... very disappointing. This was a cost saving dish, not a quality dish.

I was surprised by the service as well as with my main course as we were only one of two tables and even then I needed to crane my neck around to flag down our server to order and to get the bill process going.

I wanted to LOVE this place, but I feel it fell short IMO, maybe I went on a bad night, but I'll give it another go sometime in the future. My only hope is that management/kitchen see these honest comments and make some easy/necessary changes - there is potential for greatness here and I more than anyone would like to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here during our Valentine trip for dinner and the food was decent. I had the shrimp cargot and the lobster and shrimp linguine which was pretty good. My bf had the chicken and shrimp gumbo which was super salty and gross so we had to send it back. Also, he had the lobster tail and steak and the steak was super burnt and hard and the vegetables were cold and hard. The waitress never introduced herself and we constantly had to ask for water since she kept disappearing even though there were 10 people in the restaurant. I will not be returning here if I return to Canada."}
{"text":"I came here because my brother wanted to try a \"scotch coffee\" that this restaurant offers, and since it was my first time coming to the restaurant and since this was my first day coming back to Brampton from school my brother offered to pay for dinner, however I was so mad with the service we received I chose not to order a single thing

When we got there, we waited for a few minutes before we were even seated but this was fine to me because the restaurant was next to empty so I didn't expect the server/hostess to be waiting by the entrance. When we were seated, my brother asked a simple question regarding the coffee which was \"Is this available for takeout?\" and from there the server had an attitude. She was rude and was speaking to us as if we were stupid which is unacceptable to me. I asked for the manager and when he came over I explained to him that I myself am in the restaurant business and would never be so rude to a customer (I completely understand if a customer is being rude, by all means defend yourself) but she was rude for no reason.

I'm writing this review because I don't think much was done and honestly if I were a manager I would do more to reverse how the customer feels because nowadays it's easy for anyone to hop on a computer and trash your business.

Wish I could review the food as well but I'm too stubborn to give my hard earned money or my brother's to a restaurant that can't even hire friendly servers. Funny enough, this scotch coffee that originated the drama wasn't even the best according to my brother. lol will never return"}
{"text":"Quite a few negative reviews here, but I'm not adding to them. Went on a Thursday evening with a Groupon for 4. Several people have said it's cheaper to order from the normal menu, but not from what I could see. The waitress was polite and efficient.
 Apps: Shrimp, snails and mussels. Mains: Ribs, Seafood linguine, and pizza. Dessert: Tiramisu, Apple crumble, Brownie. None of it was \"great\", all of it was good. I particularly liked my ribs, because they weren't drowning in sauce and they were tender without being so overcooked they \"fell off the bone\", which is the last thing a rib should do.
 All in all, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place out, not once but twice in a one week for their awesome selection of seafood. Busy on a Tuesday night. One of the best sirloin steaks I've had in years. The Land and Sea dish was fresh and the sauces that came with it were tasty. Very friendIy staff and service. Great atmosphere, large and roomy booths and tables with a full bar. I will definitely visit Lousiana Seafood again, and recommend this place A+."}
{"text":"I've been here before when it first opened and it is SOOOOOOOO much better now. The price point is perfect ($$), clean decor and washrooms, excellent customer service (!!!) and the food was really good. Great menu selections for adults and even the fixed price - Groupon menu. Manager came by to politely ask why we ordered an entree for our child - and we told him that there was only fast food options on the menu and not any seafood (our kiddo loves shrimp and lobster and veggies). He offered to plate something customized and told us they would revamp the kids menu to include seafood and vegetables. 
Great place to bring a group - it's big with good ambiance. Every person we met was courteous. We had a lovely time. Thx!
This is CERTAINLY the best restaurant w this fare on this side of Brampton. Everything else is a chain. Good alternative to Milestones, Keg or Canyon Creek."}
{"text":"Outside decor - not good, not really inviting
Inside decor - much better makes you feel much much better it is a little gloomy though and I'm not really sure what the design philosophy was. It's dark my chair was broken the seat was separated from the base and the tables were uneven and wobbly. Which causes a beer to spill.
Staff - when I asked if the chowder was made in house I had to ask multiple times trying to get her to understand the question

The wings - crap frozen bs wings take them off the menu or make them fresh to order 
The gumbo - I make gumbo... That wasn't gumbo it was some depraved idea of gumbo. It was a little spicy but it felt like black pepper not like real peppers.

Clam chowder - good it wasn't out of a can, it wasn't chalky it was decent its worth it if you like chowder

The fish and chips - good size Cajun batter nice came with fries which were good as fries go. The Cole slaw... Was uninspired it takes nothing to make interesting slaw get it together find an edge 

Ribs - A fucking joke. Pre boiled ribs with a couple of grill marks with a horrible BBQ sauce I could have gotten better out of a mcrib sandwich. 

It seems the place is just surviving with no heart no soul it would take such little effort to improve but I doubt its going to happen . 

Also I wanted a Kilkenny and the tap was broke shit happens but the whole experience wasn't enjoyable 


Final note the bread... Some crap quality baguette a few slices with single serves of butter. I don't know man its so easy... Put it in a basket, warm it up and put some oil and garlic and rosemary on it... It take no effort ....  

Only go here if you have no where else to go its not the worst but there is nothing special about it"}
{"text":"Had an awesome Haddock and Chips. Good size portion and quite reasonable in price.

The food was a little slow to come but it was worth the wait. The staff are friendly and stays engaged with you.

Ambiance though is a little too dark for lunch."}
{"text":"Upon entering the place, the atmosphere seems crowded but enticing! The kitchen is an open concept so you can see what gets cranked out as a result. However this is where things change for the worse. 

The waiter was slow (partially due to the crowd so I would keep that in mind) but she was easily distracted and running all over the place, making the restaurant seem severely understaffed. It took me 35 minutes for a catfish! 

Now onto the food. The blackened catfish was flavorful. However in their attempt to bring it out fast after I asked the waitress, the seasoning did not permeate throughout the dish, making the flesh bland despite being cooked thoroughly. The ribs were also a hit and miss, not as tender as desired. The star of the show is the crawfish, being spicy and soft to the shell. I highly recommend it! 

Overall, this place would be a gem of Brampton if it was polished and carved.

Tl:dr : the food was meh, the service more so. But there is potential."}
{"text":"Okay so I was with Kris U and I'm going to disagree with his app assessment, however I would agree with him that the service left something to be desired.  

Frog legs - they reminded me of the chicken feet my mom uses to make soup, so I liked them.

Calamari - bland without the sauce.

Crawfish -taste like lobster and the sauce was very tasty.  I even used it to put on top of the calamari.

Oysters-first time having them... so can't comment with any intelligence.

My main was blackened catfish.  I liked the large fillet however I found it underseasoned which is quite uncommon for blackened foods.  I ended up adding a quarter bottle of Tabasco sauce and that made it taste much better.  

I think this place is good for the occasional meal, but average food despite the interesting entrées and apps.  However prices are reasonable, so 3.25/5"}
{"text":"Not worth the money; nothing about this place says or taste like Louisiana. Started with the chicken wings which were flavourless... Moved onto the steak which was equally as bad.... Finished with the apple crumble which was ok.... Girlfriend had the ribs and and ate a grand total of two ribs off the two racks before boxing it up to take home to our garbage compactor of a son.... Like another reviewer said just go to the KFC (and I hate KFC).... Place sucks."}
{"text":"Normally i do not give out bad reviews but i certainly will not come back to this place, don't even know where to begin. First off ordered some crawfish and it tasted like they weren't fresh at all, at first i thought it was just the first and second crawfish being not fresh but the more i ate the more i couldn't handle the strong unfreshness taste, but the sauce was decent. Secondly, ordered the fillet mignon and lobster tail with rice for around 30$ and the rice tasted like it came from a frozen packaged and i was definitely thrown off and surprised by this one, given the pricing for the dish and the beef was overcooked. The lobster tail was edible but was not the best. The interior layout was rather odd and confusing and looked a little old. And lastly the service was good, the staffs were friendly and thoughtful, came to our several times to ask how we were doing with the food, but didn't bother to complain because the pricing engraved the idea that this dish must be good for its pricing and im not the type to make a complaint (Should have) and made sure we had our drinks filled. As far as the pricing it was not worth, could've gotten a better meal for way less. Didn't think it would be a bad idea to try a new restaurant with friends but turns out it was a disappointment and certainly not coming back."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon in April 2014 for a a three-course meal for two people at Louisiana's Seafood Restaurant in Brampton for $59 because i wanted to take my twin sister out for a nice birthday meal.

We went on Wednesday night at 6:30pm. We didn't leave the establishment until more than 2 hours later.

We ordered the chicken wings and mussels for appetizers. Many of the 10 mussels were broken and closed. The bread that came with it looked like the frozen variety from no frills, came untoasted and cold.

We had the bourban ribs ($23) and salmon(420) for main courses. This is where it gets more than ridiculous, the mashed potato I was served was powder potato, it is the same kind as the ones in the hungry man meals. The ribs tasted exactly similar to the boxed ones doused in barbeque sauce. My sister can attest to the potatoes because she tried them as well, there wasn't a single part of it that was actual potatoes.

My sister's salmon stuffed with shrimp was so gross she had to eat just the outside crust of the fish and the rice that came with the meal was hard and tasted like minute rice (uncle bens).

Throughout all this the server we had took about 30 minutes to take our order and then proceeded to forget about us until we had to chase her down to get our dessert. 25 minutes later she comes by and admits to forgetting us again and laughed about it. The whole night she kept looking at us before going to help someone else.

After a few hours I became really sick at home. I have never been to a worst restaurant ever in terms of food.

I paid $59 for the groupon and it was a joke.

During the dinner I kept thinking about Swiss Chalet because they had a a repeat commercial on their tvs."}
{"text":"Waited months to finally try this restaurant. Ordered Calamari, Gumbo and Jambalaya. If I stopped eating at the calamari I would have given this restaurant an easy 4 stars. Service was quick and friendly but the gumbo soup and jambalaya earned this dining experience the 1 I gave it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"First time and not disappointed.
I heard about this place through Dealfind but I read bad reviews afterwards and I became weary about eating there.
But I am happily surprised.
I was greeted, seated and served by nice and smiley waitresses.
My mussels appetizer was ok and my main course of seafood platter was not bad; everything was ok except the lobster tail. It did not taste nor smell very fresh.
In conclusion, this restaurant is not upscale and u still get edible foods.
It seems to have improved but it can be much better.
Kudos to my waitress Nadia!"}
{"text":"Aside from expensive steakhouses or Red Lobster you won't find too many seafood places around so Louisiana's is a nice place to visit from time to time. The food is good, the prices are a little high, but catch a special and you'll do okay. In all honesty though, I go to Louisiana's once for every ten visits to Red Lobster (over a long period of time) so while not bad, it's also nothing that keeps me coming back often."}
{"text":"Returned last night with a party of 5 people and a little one. We had a great time, Three people had the chicken wings (Honey Garlic) and reported it was delicious, we all loved the Bruschetta and the crepe with stuffed crab with mini shrimp was delicious.
For mains many had chicken with fries or mash. The 8oz steak was cooked well as was the blue rare 16oz, which was impressive in both size and from feed back, both steaks were cooked to perfection. Enjoyed the ribs but once more it's akin to store bought, but the portion is large and filling so I can't complain.
The desserts were all delicious.
Honestly for a $109 Groupon for 4 people it's a lot of food and the experience is fun... the manager has told the servers not to substitute pop for coffee or tea... pretty cheap move, especially since they don't offer you coffee or tea at the end of the meal. The 16oz was not part of the Groupon it was $32 nor was the Bruschetta which was $9. But honestly, I felt they were both well worth it. 
Only concern is that I find the kids chairs a bit unsafe, it's a one size fits all deal and for a 9 month year old...it requires more padding and such around it. 
Overall great experience and well deserving of 4 stars.
Service was very good overall and their tip was well deserved."}
{"text":"I had a a bad experience using a Groupon, was told that I had to have two people present, because \"it's more money\" for them, literally her words, told them it doesn't state that, don't do business with brown people, ps I am brown, but Canadian, because these people make up their own rules, always in their benefit, the food is not bad, but like I said disrespectful conditions, f sri lankans,"}
{"text":"Its with a heavy heart I write this review. Louisiana seafood used to be one of my favourite place and one a place I would recommend often to people. The quality has gone down. Very badly. The food used to be so flavourful before now it is just bland. The service was always okay, but now was horrible. We went on Monday for all u can eat mussels. First there was never enough then they either put too much salt in or no garlic. They did not want u bring new utensils out they asked we used the same ones we had. The mussels leftover bowl. They just kept washing it and bring it back. The plate was never wiped down so it was always wet. When I got there even though the place was empty they asked me to wait like 5 minutes prior to seating us.  It sad when a good place goes bad. I am hoping this review get notice of management to make some changes to the place."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon.  Food was well prepared and enjoyed. I had the Blacken Catfish as the entree with bacon scallops as an starter.  Scallops were cook excellent.   Not overcooked so  not rubbery .  There were only 5 and were  kind of small in size.   Catfish was excellent as well.  My other half had the fried calamari and stuffed salmon.  Again no complaints.  Overall was a pleasant experience and would consider to go back again."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon. Food was good and the portions were pretty large, especially the ribs. I had a steak which was a perfect medium rare. Service was about average speed. We were unaware the groupon didn't include soft drinks but that was just not reading the fine print. We were not previously informed of a \"groupon tax\" however, which brings the star rating down to a 4."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. When this place first  opened years ago their food was awesome! I used to come here with my dad all the time and I remember how great it was. I'm pretty sure they have new owners now. We only came because I bought a deal off of WagJag  ($20 for $40 off of your bill) I had the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. The steak was awful, it had zero taste at all. No seasoning, no flavor, just grilled meat. I'm almost positive the mashed potatoes were those powdered potatoes, they were awful too. Hubby enjoyed the mussels though. The service was slow, food took a long time and the restaurant was relatively dead. The woman who greeted us when we came in was very pleasant, our waitress was nice enough but the food was not good at all. 
I sent back my meal and opted for a wrap instead that I could take home as it was getting late and we couldn't stay any longer and when we got the bill, the steak meal was on there in place of the wrap and was nearly $10 more. When I asked about it they said \"Oh we're giving you the wrap for free\". Ummmm why on earth would I pay for a $22 dollar meal I didn't eat? Eventually the bill was corrected and she agreed to take off the steak that I sent back and add in the wrap (no bill discount was offered even after having to send back a dish, wait forever for our meals and then take the replacement meal to go because we had been there so long). Very dissapointed and would not return. Would NOT recommend to anyone. It's a shame because this place used to be great!

*hubby brought the wrap we had taken to go to work the following day for lunch. He is the FARTHEST thing from a picky eater and he said it was the worst thing he had ever tasted. He took 1 bite and threw it out"}
{"text":"Why does this place have bad reviews?! Well hopefully mine will change its rating. Thanks to a TeamBuy deal, I found this hidden gem. 

Firstly, this restaurant is huge and has a nice small patio outside. What sucks is the location, because it literally is located in what looks like an unpopular strip mall on Steeles Ave, Brampton. I think it'd do so much better in Heartland, Mississauga! 

The food served is top notch. They serve some exotic stuff - varieties of fish, escargot and alligator meat. I had alligator meat for the first time and definitely recommend it to foodie adventurists like me. I thought it was cooked well; everything was presented so well too. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I would have put 0 star if I could, That how bad this place was. First walking in this restaurant already felt out of place. The restaurant looked and smell like an old dirty bar in downtown with poor selected music playing in the background. Restaurant is fairly big but wasn't busy at all. The menu have hundred of items on it. We've ordered the coconut shrimp (overpriced small portion deep fried in old oil, it came out dark brown!), clam chowder (just not good), Crayfish (my friend liked the flavour but it was so crazy spicy that he was only able to eat a couple of pieces), Jambalaya (small portion that lacked flavour and shrimp) and the grilled seafood platter (tasted ok, but the lobster tail was really small). On top of the not too impressive food, service was horrible! The wait was long, one of my friend had to wait 10 minutes before her plate came after ours. The whole time, the waitress didn't picked up any of our dirty plates, refill our water or even asked how the food was. There was 3 waitress walking around and they all saw how dirty our table was and did not come to clean it up, even after we were all done eating. I just wanted to get out of there as soon as I can. We asked for the bills, waited for an extra 15 minutes and even while paying, the dirty plates were still sitting on the table. Did I also mentioned that everything is overpriced too? I will never ever come back here!"}
{"text":"My Orders: Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo (not bad), Frog legs (tasty, esp w/ the dipping sauce!), Stuffed Salmon (t'was okay), Lobster & Shrimp Linguine (YUM!), Brownie Chocolate Cheese Cake (GET IT. IT IS TO DIE FOR.) 

Pros:
- Huge portions; my stomach was punishing me for eating so much for hours afterwards (heard of buyer's remorse? well this resembles something along the lines of \"foodie's regret\") 
- Tons of parking
- Has an outdoor patio & bar
- Free Wifi
- Huge TVs to watch golf games? (that's what was on TV on a late Sunday afternoon anyway) 
- Very helpful and polite waitress 
- I thought the washroom was really pretty; loved the flowers/decor

Cons:
- I can't seem to think of any...? And that's saying quite a bit since I don't usually give out 5's. 

Heaven on a plate. I came across this gem with a Groupon which allowed us to enjoy a prix fixe menu for two. It was definitely worth my while. There aren't a lot of fine dining options in Brampton, to which I'm aware of anyway (and I'm quite the foodie). It's a diamond in the rough, no doubt."}
{"text":"NOT PLEASED!

Reservations are required for Groupon vouchers and that's fine. First, I tried to make a reservation on a Friday of the Mother's day weekend. They said they don't accept reservations for Groupon holders because of the said occasion which I think should have been mentioned in the Fine print. Anyways, for the second time, booking went fine. I clarified on the phone that I have the Groupon Voucher. Now, when we got there, they almost refused to serve us. They said something about the machine not working or something. I was upset at this time and told the manager that when I phoned the restaurant, I stated that I had the voucher and that if there was an issue, they could have told me upon reservation. Ugh. I was getting furious and I guess they could tell so they just let us. 

The entire time that we were there, and let me tell you, it was quite a long time, it wasn't even packed at all. I was shocked because service was extremely slow. I almost didn't enjoy the food because the amount of time that we had to wait. Servings was huge but still that wouldn't matter if you're not that hungry anymore. Gumbo and Shrimp Linguine tasted good and thus the 2 stars rating otherwise it would have been just 1 star.

I would maybe eat here again if I have the voucher but NEVER on a regular occasion. You pay so much for a service that's so bad and an average food. I would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We've been to Louisiana restaurant after getting a coupon from Groupon on Saturday, April 22; the food was not too bad, the kitchen was dark and dirty and The waitress tried to be nice, but messed up the order a couple of times.  We've been charged more than what Groupon said; we ended up paying much more than any restaurant in the area. The seats are old and ripped off, and the entire restaurant is old and dirty. Bad experience especially on my anniversary; not recommended to anyone, and not planning to go back again."}
{"text":"The food at this place was okay but the service was slow. I give them props on their menu because they have many items I'd like to try.
I went here after work, mid-afternoon, and no one was in the restaurant except for one large party that was celebrating something. Still my food took FOREVER to come out. That would be a big complaint. I also found the atmosphere inside weird and the place seemed a bit dirty but maybe that's just me.
I LOVE seafood but am sorry to say I was somewhat underwhelmed.. Nothing about this meal stood out and I'd say it was average in terms of seafood, which is disappointing since Louisiana is supposed to specialize in seafood.
However, with all that, it's not to say I'd never return, but I also wouldn't make a special trip to come back here."}
{"text":"I went here in 2014. I used to pass the restaurant frequently and always wanted to give it a try. It seems big and therefore might have good quality and tasty food. 

The place was quite big, but it was not lit very well. It was very dull in the restaurant which did not make my dining experience and good one from the start. It kind of brought down my energy.

The restaurant was not busy at all. I think there were two other tables with customers, and some at the bar. Yet the service was very slow. 

I ordered the frog legs appetizer just to try it out and it was alight... Nothing spectacular. It was fried with a drizzle of sweet balsamic over it. I'm not one to get grossed out by eating weird stuff. I enjoy trying different cuisines and delicacies, but they left the little toes on the fog legs and that kind of turned my stomach. 

I know an animal died in order for me to eat my meal, but I didn't want to me reminded of it every time I take a bite or its leg... Lol"}
{"text":"I would pass this building so many times without even realizing it was a restaurant.
It's in the same plaza as the Running Room and KFC on Hurontario and Steeles.
Quite honestly, I thought it was a church, or part of a the church behind it. 
I just never noticed it!

I didn't mind the food here, I had to give it a second try before I wrote a review.
First Visit:
I really enjoyed my jambalaya pasta. It was small for $19 though. If I didn't have so many appetizers I would've finished it all and still been hungry.
I liked the crawfish and oysters and this was the only time I've tried calamari that I didn't mind (I usually don't like it).
I wasn't a fan of the frogs legs.

Second Visit:
We had the frogs legs (3 for $10)
Pitcher of Louisiana House beer ($14) it was pretty good
Calamari (it was good!)
Greek Salad
Coconut Shrimp
King Crab ($24)
And Salmon
I ordered the seafood penne ($19). I found the sauce watery and lacked flavour. I definitely like the Jambalaya pasta a lot better.
I found the portion size for this was small too, I finished it!!!!

I wish they had fresh ground pepper and grated parmesan cheese for the pasta (this is the second place I've been to recently that didn't offer it).

For dessert we had the apple pie (yummy!), a chocolate \"sundae\" ($4, came with caramel sauce. I didn't like it), and the tiramisu! Super yummy.

The service was not bad, we did have to ask for water refills and the waitress wasn't  around too much.
I would go back again though. The place gave me  good vibes and despite some things about it that I didn't like, there were more things that I did."}
{"text":"First off, this place is quiet. We were the only people inside and it was dinner time in a Thursday. 

We ordered calamari, crawfish, a shrimp dish, a catfish dish and raw oysters. 

The calamari was amazing. The sauce that came with it was the added bonus. 
The crawfish was good but nothing like how they make it in a crawfish boil. This crawfish although was not fresh and tasted like curry masala. It was drenched in curry. The oysters were fantastic. I would return only for the calamari and oysters. 

The shrimp and catfish dish was great except the rice was not fresh rice. It was the uncle bens rice mix in a bag that got heated. My boyfriend is a chef so he told me. Very disappointing. 

The place is quiet and we didn't feel rushed. I was not impressed with the main dishes but their starters were well prepared.

AVOID THE ORANGE RICE!! 

See pictures."}
{"text":"Since the new ownership... its been better.

Only half shell oysters that I know of in Brampton. 
NOTE: careful.. as their shucking is not the best.  There are often pieces in there.  

Their crab cakes, calamari, mussles (white wine), escargots are good.  portions could be better for all listed above except the crab cakes.

I get the Linguini with scallops... huge portion.  Very good.
My husband gets the seafood pasta.  Comes wiyh mussles, shrimps and fish pieces... which he loves.  

It is a bit pricey... but for a seafood craving... this place does the job.

Patio is great for summertime. 
Friday night has a live band."}
{"text":"I was looking to try something different so we went to yelp for help and found this place.
GPS sent us to the wrong place but I eventually found it.
Place was bigger the I thought, with plenty of TV's to watch the hockey game.
Looking at the menu I noticed a Greek salad??? And when hey gave us the bill it came a long with a ouzo candy?? Strange greek customs in a Louisiana restaurant.

I ordered crab cakes which were not good at all, I guess I have been spoiled in florida with that. Then we orders crepes stiffed with shrimp and crab. Mine was still frozen...so things at this point were just not going good. 

My main meal was snapper blackened style. I asked the waitress to get mine extra blackened. When my fish came it was not blackened but more like reddened!! So I said here we go strike three. But to be honest it was not the bad and the restaurant salvaged a 3 star from me. The fish saved the day.

service was good, our frozen crepe was quickly replace with nice warm new ones without making a big fuss. 

My wife had the Jambalaya rice which I tried and was nice and spicy!!!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant after almost 2 years and were shocked at how the quality and taste of the food had fallen. The wait staff was ill informed and though the restaurant had just 5 occupied tables, they were slow. The craw fish tasted like it had been frozen badly - the flesh was spongy. The gravy it came in was not cooked long enough thus almost bitter. Everything else that we ordered was passe'. I am sad to say, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"worst seafood place on the face of the planet 
haven't been in years, not a fan 
i'll never go back"}
