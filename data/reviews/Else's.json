{"text":"Great place! The interior is really causy and nice looking. It's the sort of place where you could spend hours talking and not noticing it. The staff is really nice and you can also go there to eat. You have a good selection of alcohols."}
{"text":"I don't know who to be mad at... this \"bar\" or Yelp. Walked in after reading all the good reviews wanting to enjoy a drink in a nice atmosphere on a Friday night away from the over crowded St. Laurent. Walked in and asked to sit at the bar to enjoy a drink...the employee responds \"this is a pub you have to order food not just drinks\"    What!?!     I am not from Montreal so I do not know if this is a regular thing, but later that night having to find another bar I asked the door man if we had to order food or could we just have drinks... he just looked at me with confusion and laughed telling me no you can just order drinks...I don't know why yelp has you under bars (bars you can order just drinks) or American (in america ((minus fast food)) you can go to a restaurant, sit at the bar, and just order drinks)... bottom line Im sure this place is awesome...if you are going to order food, but if you want to order just drinks and relax...go elsewhere"}
{"text":"This is a great bar. The food was delicious - I particularly recommend the fish and chips. They also have a great selection of drinks, particularly scotch. The atmosphere is very nice - good music but quiet enough that you can still socialize and hear your friends.  I'll definitely be going back! Note that they do not take credit cards, only debit cards."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very low-key, even during the most touristy parts of the year in Montreal. It's a place where you can go with friends and actually hear each other talk, or go on your own with a book to decompress after a long day. The staff and patrons are the perfect balance - everyone is friendly enough but nobody is overly interested in anyone else. It's worth noting that part of their alcohol license means that you have to have food on the table in order to have drinks, but they have lots of options for small and inexpensive but good snacks. Even though I no longer live in Montreal, I stop by Else's every time I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot with amazing food. You definitely got to try their hotsauce, it is awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. The menu is inexpensive and exciting, and they always have one or two appealing vegetarian options. I recently had the quinoa burgers and they were lovely- filling but I didn't feel stuffed. The vegetarian chilli is great too. The location and decor are lovely, and the staff is always pleasant. I really love this place!"}
{"text":"A chill atmosphere, full of creatives. In the afternoon, definitely a place where it's okay to fly solo, have a coffee or scotch and food, and focus on your writing, design, or other work. In the evening, it fills with interesting people.  Reasonable prices, friendly staff, artsy ambiance."}
{"text":"Another weekend in Montreal, and this time three separate visits to Else's. I don't live in that neighborhood, but my hotel is only about a mile away and Else's is well worth the walk! Once again, the combination of charming bartenders (Julia and Kat, not Mia as previously reported!), and a great vibe with really good inexpensive snacks worked magic on me. The windows are open to the warm street on this charming little street corner, and the conversations are varied and lively. There WAS a television on (bot only temporarily- for an important soccer match), but this is not a TV dominated space, and thank god! Try the shrimp tacos, asparagus salad, and the chicken wings. All were sampled by your humble reviewer, and all were great. You just can't miss with this joint!"}
{"text":"I love that the atmosphere here is low key and there is a great selection of draft beer. Next time I will be trying the food as well!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite bars in Montreal. It's cozy, dark, friendly, and just plain gives me the warm fuzzies.   As everyone notes, they have a restaurant license so you are requested to order food so that you can also order drinks. It used to be that they had super cheap options like olives or samosas for less than $5. That's increased in the last several years and now most of the options are around $10 or more. In my personal experience, we've always been able to share dishes. In the dozens of times I've been here, we have not been asked to order individual plates. But other people's experience differs, so I don't really know of it's something we say or do or just luck.   Beer menu is not huge, but sufficient for most tastes. They've also got cocktails, cider, hot drinks.   If you sit near the back of the bar, there are large notebooks leaning on the piano. They are filled with the notes and doodles of past patrons over the years. They're good for a browse when you're a few drinks in.   I don't really come here for the food, Else's is just that special that I'm willing to put up with this little inconvenient charade of ordering food just so I can keep drinking here. Sometimes, I think this charade is part of the charm."}
{"text":"Bar très charmant, tacos très correct et les boissons chaudes sont très originales !!  Je recommande chaudement ;-)"}
{"text":"My favorite bar throughout my entire visit to Montreal.  Kind of divey, but clean and unpretentious.  Great food too!  A kind waitstaff, fun location and great music rounds out the whole experience."}
{"text":"This was no one's first choice for eats but we skipped Schwartz's due to the line and even had to bail on Santropol due to a 45+ minute wait.  Did I mention it was bitter cold?  We wandered to Else's figuring, corrrectly that we would find an open table.  The food was meh but it was warm in there.  I think its more of a bar but we just got hot cider and tea with our chili.  75% of our group got chili because the waitress couldn't figure out  how to work the oven for the other food we ordered.  The tofu dip was good."}
{"text":"Friends's from McGill's hangout and Else's is still their top 3 for favorite bars. So I must agree it is a good place. Many different beer choices (mixes of beers with Guinness and cream ale.. delicious). The music is always fantastic, and the servers were always polite."}
{"text":"It's been a year and a half since I've been here but I've decided to write this review now because nowhere in Montreal or Toronto in the past year and a half have I been able to find a mojito as good as the one I had at Else's. There was so much mint in it that it was unbelievably refreshing. I'm disappointed by all the mojitos I've had elsewhere because they typically only consist of one or two mint small leaves, which you can hardly taste. Else's is a little out of the way, but I hope to make it back sometime for another mojito and really hope that they haven't started cheaping out on ingredients since I was last there!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I went during a recent trip to Montreal with a few friends. It has a great atmosphere; good music, friendly people, wonderful and attentive waiters, and overall fun feel. Also completely unpretentious. My friend spilled her drink completely upon getting it without taking a sip and the waitress/bartender brought over a new one right away. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pub. Reasonable prices. Perfect for lunch, a 5a7, or a quiet date.  Else's has gone through a lot of changes over the last decade because they only have a restaurant license and periodically re-invent the menu. The current menu, however, is at the best of its been in years. Serving sizes and presentation range anywhere from a solid, comfort food lunch to perfect for sharing. A few of things worth trying include: - the Bison Sliders (2 per serving) - the Shrimp or Pibil Tacos (4 per serving) - or the Philly Cheese Steak (comes with side salad  The place is also a solid bet for a quiet sunday afternoon or pints and cocktails late into the night. The music is never too loud, and even when it's busy, it doesn't seem to crowded (despite its size).  If you're in the 'hood and looking for a satisfying bite or just to catch up with friends or that book you've been working through, you should definitely consider Else's."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Montreal , this place has a dive bar feel despite its location.  A pretty good selection of beers on tap and bottle,not an extensive list. The menu is a unique take on small plates and bar food with numerous vegetarian options. All the workers were friendly and helpful .The decoration was a little interesting but overall this was a great experience ."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood bar/tapas  place  to take a date.  The vibe inside is really cool and the wait staff is super friendly. Amazing scotch /wine list and a really cool inexpensive tapas style menu with about 10-15 items that always change. They have meat and vegetarian options and a couple great dessert options as well."}
{"text":"An older crowd, but a nice place to grab a quick drink! We stopped in to avoid the rain. Waitress was pleasant and drinks were good. We debated ordering food, but found there were limited options."}
{"text":"Intimate place with a lot of character. The food is so-so but you don't really go there for a meal--it's a bar. Good beer list and an impressive variety of whiskeys available if that's your thing."}
{"text":"This bar is really cute and has a great atmosphere. I agree with one of the reviewers that this bar is probably at its best during winter snow storms. There are many advantages to this bar as other reviewers pointed out - the music is not too loud, nice selection of beers, wine and cocktail. Surely, everyone in your crowd will find something to enjoy. However, we didn't drink any beer or cocktail that was really really good but maybe we didn't try enough. I was just much more impressed by the beer at Dieu du Ciel. While Else's offers a range of food options, our food didn't amaze us (but it's definitely ok!).   Basically, I would come here if I was in the area but I don't think it's worth an extended trip down. Also, I would definitely come here if members of your group like different things."}
{"text":"Great bar! A lot more options than most other bars we found in Montreal, especially in the Old District. The beers were great - especially the oatmeal stout (better than Guinness!). I got a scotch off of their extensive list, can't tell you which one I ordered, but I enjoyed it. The service was slightly slow, but it's ok because the ambiance and crowd were good. We got nachos, as there was a 1 food item minimum and enjoyed them thoroughly. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a bar around this area of Saint Laurent."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few regrets I have about no longer drinking. A cozy little bar that reminds me of San Francisco..."}
{"text":"I don't know why they don't obtain a stand alone liquor license.  You must order food in order to get a beer.  And thus add another $12 to your tab.  So not a place to stop in for a drink or two.  Otherwise it is a quirky bistro style lounge with plants and organic colored chairs and walls.  No patio.  A bit noisy inside.  Limited menu.  But one can see outside very well.  They seem to have free wifi.  Unique atmosphere on a quiet side street."}
{"text":"I love Else's. My past two experiences there have been a little bizarre though. I love the atmosphere, it has great drinks and the service staff are phenomenal.   The confusing part about Else's is it's in a perpetual identity crisis. Is it a bar? No because you have to order food - or at least some people in your party do. But it's not quite a restaurant either.  A couple years ago, a group of us would regularly go to Else's, order a couple small dishes for our table to share, drink, and enjoy the place. One day we went, and were told that there was a new policy: everyone must order food (and since we came for happy hour drinks only and not dinner, we left). My most recent night there was for a date, and it was really great! I was looking forward to trying the new menu and was excited to get late dinner and drinks.   However, my expectations for the new menu were not totally met. My boyfriend got the pulled pork which was awesome. I was looking for something a bit healthier, and on the recommendation of my server I got scallops. It was more of an appetizer though (an expensive appetizer; I realize scallops are expensive but they were listed with other main dishes so I was expecting maybe more sides or something). They were still delicious, but if you are hungry and want something healthy... do not get the scallops. So the menu seems a bit inconsistent, but the atmosphere is still wonderful. The best advice I can give is ask your server a lot of questions so that you have realistic expectations about the food. Hoping next time I have a hiccup free experience."}
{"text":"One of the better \"bars\" in Montreal. Very intimate (read: small and dark). Candles on the tables add to the ambiance. Usually good music playing. Tasty food and good drink selection. If you have a big group get there early to secure tables. This is a favorite spot of McGill Geology grad students.  Also a good spot for working during the day."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Montreal, Else's provided a welcome respite from the unseasonable cold.  It was recommended by a great friend and former grad school classmate who is now studying at the nearby McGill University.   She lives close by, in a lovely neighborhood near Montreal's pleateau, and this is one of her favorite local haunts.  If I lived here I could see myself returning to this cozy, mellow establishment during the day with my book or laptop to relax with a cup of their excellent cafe au lait, or at night with someone I want to get to know better.  I sipped my coffee during the evening too, but for those interested in something stronger there is a full and interesting cocktail menu (my friend gave her exotic tequila beverage a stamp of approval) along with a selection of hard cider and wine.  Their food menu is filled with tasty looking small bites, such as open faced sandwiches, a platter of Indian treats like fragrant samosas and pakoras, and a variety of pizzas.  Its worth noting that their liquor licensing is limited, and any drinkers need to order food to accompany their libation.   With two dollar cheese bread with salad on the menu, that's not hard to accomplish on a budget.  With its dim lighting, casual eclectic decor and thoughtful music selections (we heard everything from Fleet Foxes to Frank Sinatra), Else's is an ideal neighborhood gathering place."}
{"text":"Anyone who's ever had a crush on someone else in Montreal has suggested that they go for drinks at Else's. It's cozy, unpretentious and at the comfortable intersection of St Denis East Plateau franco cool, St Laurent hipsterdom and a quick saunter away from the McGill student ghetto. That means that Else's is pure Montreal where you can switch back and forth between eng and fr. It's kindova jam-packed place with the tables tucked in pretty close so if you're bilingual, you can get in some choice eavesdropping while you're having yourself a nice drink. They've got cider on tap as well as a pretty respectable selection of Quebec microbrews and hard liker.  Food-wise, I like: the samosas. They're nice and greasy though the Indian platter feels a bit sparse. The chilli's where the money's at, in my book. You get a nice full bowl of thick red-bean tomato stew with some nice cumin and chili highlights and a plate full of corn chips to go with it. Cheese and no cheese options are available."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my cousin, the decor is great, the food is great(although the wings were a bit too salty for my liking), the drinks were good as well. I asked the waitress what drink she would recommend and she said the Kir Royal but my cousin's Mojito was by far better than that. The prices are cheap, and the atmosphere is very friendly and not too loud. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious - had shrimp tacos, cider, and the cheesecake. Great service and decor, (when I visited) good for quiet conversation."}
{"text":"Cozy bar, attentive service, delicious food! We shared the bison burger and the salad and both were exceptional. The roasted veggies in the salad resembled kimchi and I could not get enough of them. Great variety of beers on draft!"}
{"text":"I live in New York now. I am homesick for this bar/ cafe. Maybe it's who I was with the nights I was there or the timat in my life but this is my favorite bar and probably always will be. I used to live on Laval around the corner and would love running over to get a hot calvacidre and split the mandatory small plate of veggie pizza or indian snacks. There's nothing quite like running head down through a snowy Montreal night to turn the corner and get inside Else's door and find the mellow life going on inside. One night, at the table next to me, a man who I am assuming was a magician pulled a bunch of doves out of a box. It somehow seemed normal. Something about the ambiance and the attitude and the drink menu and the story of the founder Else and her vision for her namesake makes this place the best meeting place, the most special first dates venue, and the best escape from the utter chaos that was St Laurent during uni."}
{"text":"Nice, dark, slightly dive-y room, with warm, almost Christmaslike light.  Good selection of whiskies.  Topnotch chocolate cheesecake.  Decent espresso.  A hint of street life visible from the bar.  Talkative, happy,  grown-up crowd, all seemingly there to converse with their friends rather than to bang tequila slammers down their hatches.  Well-mannered, easygoing staff who'll treat you kindly.    They've got a restaurant licence only and they'll ask you to order food with your glass of Bushmills, but what's a drink without a nosh?  The only real problem I have with this place is getting a decent chair on a cold autumn or winter afternoon.  Usable restroom.  I always peek in when I'm in the area on an errand, just to see if there's anywhere I'd want to sit for a quick drink.  It's too cozy a place to walk past without checking."}
{"text":"Oh Else's, how much have I missed you...Now that I see you again, lots!! Haven't been in over a year, until last night.   What a cool place! Love the energy, we could have stayed for another 3 hours just talking away, sipping our beers, enjoying our table surrounded by a crowd of tightly packed tables of diverse fauna. A microcosm of Montreal, that was it. Yes, that is what it was. E.G. Montreal at its best.  Yup, we also ordered food with our Asahi and Czechvar beers. Tacos Pibil (delish); Grilled Polenta (very surprisingly good. One does not expect it so good from a pub, but this is no ordinary pub!!); Butter Chicken (fair. More British style butter chicken than Indian).   Please keep this place friendly, with good staff and service. It is paramount. We shall be back in a few weeks for certain. Never again shall we be apart for so long."}
{"text":"This is little local bar with nice music and ambiance.  People are little older than other bars on St. Laurent and it's not touristy  but where local people hang out.  My husband and I, we just came back from this bar after having 4 gin and tonic, Guinness, 2 Porto blanc and little quesadilla.  I was very happy with our bill. 3pm to 8pm, there is Happy Hour - 9$ for 2 drinks - Gin&Tonic, Vodka & Tonic, Rhum&Coke and Porto Blanc- and also pitcher of Sangria for 25$ (for large one).   And There are great selections of SingleMalt Scotchs.  Try it!  The music is great.  The tables are nice.  We like to play some games while we are drinking and it was perfect place for it.   The best thing is that All the drinks are Good price - Ok I am from Menlo Park and I believed that the Bay area has the most expensive booze but When you start to live in Canada, that's different story.   I have nice \"real\"pint of guiness with $6- after tax.  All the prices are already included Taxs so you don't have to be surprised by unexpected Large bill after several drinks. - 12.5% Tax usually added to your bill :)   We played Banana Grams - nice game you should try :P-for 2 hours and drank and talked.  Nice place for Local, or people who are little mature side."}
{"text":"C'est l'endroit idéal pour un verre entre amis, pour les grandes confidences inavouables. J'ai adoré"}
{"text":"Great little bar to chill with friends after the work week is done. Food is really good, service is very down to earth. If your ever in the plateau, I recommend going to Else's."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick drink at Else's around noon. As such, there weren't many people there, and we didn't grab any food, so my opinion will be brief.  The bartenders were cool guys, with good conversation. The bar itself has a traditional vibe, with a sparing number of old ball decorations.  I grabbed myself a Brume Suisse (i.e. Swiss Fog), which is a delightfully warm Goldschlager and cinnamon drink. If you're walking by the bar on a cold day, with a hankering for a bit of a buzz, this drink is perfection. It's the sort of thing an irresponsible parent would give to their kid to put them to sleep. Cool bar. Try it out."}
{"text":"Such a great spot. When my Saturday-night plans fell through, I turned to yelp in search of a nearby bar with chill vibes, which led my boyfriend and me to Else's. The whimsical décor and abundant indoor plants provided ambiance, and the quesadilla did not disappoint. Enough people filled the moderately sized restaurant so that I felt satisfied my evening of \"going out\" while avoiding some overcrowded amateur hour. It's a good spot for a casual date or to catch up with friends. Keep in mind you have to order food in order to drink because they only have a restaurant license. I found this a bit off-putting, but then again, I'm new to the area. I will definitely return, but next time I will come with an appetite."}
{"text":"Nice uncrowded atmosphere with a few St-Ambroise and Griffon on tap, which as far as mainstream beer goes, is pretty decent. In fact it's the only place I know of where one can get a pint of St-Ambroise IPA for $5 + tax. It accomplishes what it tries to do. Haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"Bien situé, au cur du plateau et de pleins d'activités, ce bar/resto ne paie pas de mine de l'extérieur, on dirait presque une soirée privée, tant il fait sombre et les gens ont l'air relax! A l'intérieur, il y a un peu de bruit, souvent du monde, les tables rondes arborent des peintures artistiques et sont éparpillées un peu partout. Il y a un 5@8 à 5.75$ la pinte de bière (pas mal de choix), et il y a un menu assez varié avec des plats autour de 8 à 12$ Les chicken wings sont un peu épicées, vraiment bonnes, et les tacos de porc mariné à l'orange sont excellents aussi! Le service est très bon A essayer!"}
{"text":"Nice place with inexpensive menu of drinks & food. Went there with friends and fell in love with the place. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The best neighbourhood bar in the plateau. Best in the early afternoon when the windows are open. All the food is good but I find they do light dishes better than heavy."}
{"text":"Really cool neighbourhood bar that I regularly frequent. The decor is eclectic and the staff are all very friendly and skilled at their jobs. The prices on pints and cocktails are fair, and they have great happy hour deals that last longer than 5 a 7. The food menu is not what you'd expect from a bar, but everything that I've eaten has been very tasty. The crowd is a bit older than other joints in the area, which is a refreshing escape from the wild St-Laurent club scene."}
{"text":"Went there last night after reading glorious reviews on yelp and was slightly disappointed - it's very standard. Food isn't great - just ok (we had the chili con crane, veg burger and fajita), and the beer is great - same as any other pub around. It was a nice place to seat and catch up with an old friend, where the music isn't too loud, but soon after our plates and glasses went empty we were served the bill (without asking), as if to hint that we should leave."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it always seems like my friends are more impressed by Else's than I am. This by no means lessens my affection for this place (There is this cured fish and cucumber salad dish that makes me feel like I got punched in the mouth with a pack full of flavour! Though I do wish the portion size was MUCH bigger...), but my friends always seem to pick the dish that's a decent portion and delicious (Fish&Chips, Calamari). This one friend said the calamari at their place was the BEST calamari he's ever tasted. Quite the praise if you ask me.   Nonetheless, if you're in Montreal and you want to bring your friends to a chill and cozy place with great ambiance,  I think Else's would be a great choice. They have quite a selection of drinks and great food. I'm the type of person where if I happen to recommend a restaurant that my friends like, I always feel like I take full responsibility of the meal as though I'm the chef. Therefore, Else's would probably be my best bet for a great recommendation."}
{"text":"I used to go there a lot, love the chill atmosphere and used to like the food. Sadly things have changed. This week I went there with a couple of friends and it is not the same place I used to love.   The menu changed and there is no more calamaris,fish and chips, or ribs (or any of the other tasty treats you see on the photos in this profile)!!!   When asking about why this change was made we got the answer that they have changed the chef and gotten rid of their deep frier and and as side of attitude from the waitress. After inquiring about the calamaris the quality of service decreased drastically, I guess they are sick of people asking for food they no longer have.  We settled for the chicken wings and noodle salad (a sad substitute for the calamaris), which arrived after about half an hour and the (bland) chicken wings had the same temperature of the noodle salad.   I guess they are trying to be some kind of fancier gastro-pub, which they sadly fail big time at."}
{"text":"Good bar...great bartenders."}
{"text":"A classic neighborhood bar.  I stopped in after exploring Montreal and to finally get out of the rain.  It was packed and only got more packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Canadians know how to drink!  I ordered a Caesar, which was awesome.  You do have to order food in this place regardless, but they were kind enough to let me know and told me I didn't have to order right away.  The menu was surprisingly eclectic but I went with the chili.  It was a good size dish and good enough to hold me over for dinner in a few hours.  I would recommend stopping here and thanks to Yelp, I did."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great little neighborhood pub in the truest sense.  Spicy garlic shrimp were delicious.  Shepherds pie was a bargain at $10.  So good.  Service was great too - attentive but not overbearing.  Tip: they don't accept credit only debit or cash.  Not a big deal but good to know in advance."}
{"text":"Un resto qui joue au bar Nous y allons en général avec des collègues, ou des amis et c'est toujours la même chose : si tu veux boire une bière ou un whisky (leur carte est plutôt bien fournie) il faut prendre à manger. Un peu pénible quand t'y vas en après-midi... En plus de ça, la musique est vraiment forte, ce qui fait qu'on a de la difficulté à s'entendre parler. Désagréable quand on vient entre amies ! Heureusement que les amuse-bouches (oui, à part les cotes levées, il ne faut pas s'attendre à y manger réellement) sont bons !"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great hidden gem!! Amazing service!! Fabulous food. Very lively atmosphere.  So closely to everything. So happy we tried this place out"}
{"text":"Our original plans had to be changed due to the holiday, so we asked at the front desk of our hotel for a relaxing place with affordable drinks and good food.  He mentioned Else's and gave us the history of the place and it sounded up our alley.  I noticed someone mentioned \"coffee shop\" in their review and it almost feels like a coffee shop where people realized the coffee just wasn't doing it for them anymore and they just evolved into drinking alcohol.  Atmosphere is great and has a bit of a pub feel.  Totally non-pretentious.  The servers were delightful and tolerated our massacring of the French language.  Drinking beer in Quebec is a treat.  You don't need to know all of the breweries... just pick a style of beer you like and try it.  I've never been disappointed (and I'm a bit of a beer snob).  We tried the Fried Spinach & Mushroom Pierogis (the server recommended them fried) and they were fabulous!  We were sharing so we did Fish & Chips as well, which was plenty good, but I was craving more Pierogis!  All in all, it was a nice evening.  Service was great and the drinks and food were delicious.  The bill wasn't too damaging (this is Montreal, after all) and we left happy.  If we were locals, I could see us frequenting this place quite a bit."}
{"text":"This was exactly what my friends and I were looking for when we came here for late night drinks! A very chill atmosphere with a simple but good menu to order from and drinks galore. What a cool place to have in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Else's is one of those small neighbourhood gems, tucked in on roy, slightly off St. Laurent. The vibe is of a quieter bar, dimly lit with candles on each table - another great date place.   The food is great for the price you are paying and is definitely a notch higher than your average bar food. They have great tacos on real taco shells (corn based soft taco shells) and their serving of wings is very very generous.   We had their mulled cider (with cinnamon and lemon), not quite as good as ones you get in Europe but paired with the cozy environment, it was definitely beyond pleasant."}
{"text":"If  I was a local i would probably love this place. Its Like Cheers everyone knows your name. We had planned an impromptu HH here and arrived before anyone else. The soccer match was on so most of the tables were filled and a nice stranger offered us seats with him until something opened up. HH here seams to be popular with people who live in the neighborhood. We got a grande pitcher of sangria ($25) and an order of nachos.The sangria was just ok and had a little too much ice and fruit. The nachos were strange i was not a fan. The vegetarian \"chill\" had little flavor and they used mozzarella cheese very weird. The beer list was pretty legit and they offer some specials featuring rum,vodka and Gin. I would put this bar in the dive bar  category and transplant this place to NoLibs where it rightfully belongs."}
{"text":"Like almost everyone else, I can't emphasize enough how much I love Else's. This cozy, slightly dim-lit neighborhood gem is the perfect place to bring your friends or loved ones for some drinks and a nice meal. I went there with my parents for lunch, and everyone loved what they had ordered.  I got a hot calvacidre (calvados + cider), and my dad got an allongé while my mom just stuck with water. My dad said that personally he didn't find it that strong, but then again, he does tend to like his coffee stronger than most people do (I took him to Juliette et Chocolat the next day and he loved their espresso). I thought that the calvacidre was pure boozy goodness with a hit of apple, but smelling it before drinking is not exactly the most pleasing experience for the olfactory senses.  For the food, my mom got the shrimp tacos with arugula salad, my dad got the pulled pork buns, and I got the polenta with feta, prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes, and a boiled egg. I thought the polenta tasted amazing when combined with the other ingredients, as it tasted creamy, slightly sour from the cheese, salty from the prosciutto, bitter from the arugula, and sweet from the tomato, so it really teases your palate. The only thing I wish was slightly better was that the egg was served runny, just how I like it, but it was also cold. If it was a warm egg it would have made it that much better. The shrimp tacos were also fantastic and contained the perfect mix of shrimp chunks and vegetables, and I love how they used corn tortillas instead of flour ones. The pulled pork buns were meaty and slightly sweet, but they weren't overbearingly fatty and they were served with much less guilt than normal pork buns.  Honestly, if it's your first time here, I feel like you could order anything on the menu and it would be a winner. I've also had the mac and cheese and pulled pork tacos before, and they're nothing short of divine. I can't wait to go back and try more things someday."}
{"text":"This place is so adorable! We were nearby and my friend suggested this place for dinner, so off we went. It's in a quiet neighborhood but I feel it fits perfectly. Apparently Else was a kick ass Scandiavian who opened up this restaurant years ago. Sadly she has passed away, but her memory lives out in the food.   I was a bit hesitant in trying the chicken tacos but they came out perfectly. My friend had the quesadilla and felt the same way. The staff is really friendly, case in point I nearly walked out without my sunglasses and they stopped me right in time. :)   This is a cozy little joint where you can relax with friends or take a date out for an intimate night. Highly recomended!"}
{"text":"Decent bar, music was chill, not too loud, they make you buy food to drink here, their liquor license is for a pub/restaurant if you know the laws in Quebec then you understand,.  We only drank, bought a snack for the table, quesadillas, menh.   Beer cold, service good, chill time.  Go here."}
{"text":"Recently Else's menu has changed for the better. The food is out of this world, and I'm actually craving those spicy shrimps. The price is unbeatable and the drinks are great (great drink specials too). It's the best to be for good food, great conversation and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, I went for the samosas and pork and it was so good. Pretty good service. Definitely a place to eat and chill with friends."}
{"text":"What a find!  We stumbled in (with an assist from Lonely Planet). The place is on a corner in a residential neighborhood - albeit one where one window facing the bar has a female mannequin legs dangling out.  Late PM and the place was busting with Mac's.  Obviously a lot of regulars but our service (we were obviously the only tourists in the place) was excellent.    A very good beer selection. You need to order one food item for the table - we were steered to a $4 quesadilla that proved surprisingly good.  A comfortable but vibrant atmosphere - well lit and a good soundtrack that's not too loud for talking or reading. One of the great neighborhood bars."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth. Dinner is standard hipster-fare and a little less spicy than I'd like it, but basically very good; the cheesecakes are next-level brilliant. Drinks are reasonably-priced, maybe a tiny bit more than I'd like, but I'm a cheapskate. Huge selection of scotches and bourbons, and a lot of cocktails made with cider, all of which are worth trying (they mull the cider but keep it carbonated--awesome!). Great décor. The best place to bring out-of-town friends to impress them, especially when it's surrounded on all sides by the great historic Montréal row houses. Same bartenders a lot of the time, and one did a shot of Jameson with me, on-the-house, on my birthday after accurately guessing that it was my favourite liquor."}
{"text":"The service was so slow, the waitress was rude (very snippy and forgot our orders), then her shift ended before our food arrived and we had to pay while we were getting our food (which ended up being pretty meh)."}
{"text":"I've been to many bars in my lifetime all over the world and Else's ranks amongst my ultimate top 5.  There are 'fun' bars and there are 'cheap' bars - but for my overall favourites, Else's is part of an elite circle in my rankings.  My criteria:  1) Good selection of whisk(e)y and draft beer 2) Unpretentious without being collegiate/divey/hipster - I should be equally comfortable going there in shorts and flip-flops or in a suit - it should be cozy and dark with a relaxed vibe. 3) Good for all occasions - suitable for any celebration that entails copious consumption of alcohol or drowning your sorrows by the bar by yourself or drinking for a wake 3) Friendly, eclectic and interesting regulars and patrons 4) Knowledgeable bartender and staff that clearly love their jobs 5) No TVs - NONE.  I don't like sports in my bars.  And music should be in the background and never intrude on conversation. 6) Classless and appropriate for all (drinking) ages  Else's has all this in spades.  And it's definitely a locals bar being off the Ste-Laurent drag and it was one of the few places in Montreal that allowed me to start a tab (seriously Montrealers - paying per round is lame).  Yes, they are officially licensed as a restaurant (check out the history of licensing struggles on the menu) so you may be asked to order some food to drink here.  But there's a $4 vegetarian pizza on the menu... you know what to do.  In a word - this place is comfortable.  I walked in timidly at 10PM expecting to grab a quick pint before calling it a night.  I stumbled out at 3AM with an invite to a rock show, hand-rolled cigarettes, toasting to East Vancouver to someone that lived 3 blocks from me and a few solid recommendations on good hip-hop joints in the city and armed with the knowledge of how to fake a (male) orgasm.  This place is that good - slink in for a bit and you'll comfortably lose a few hours here drinking and bullshitting.  It didn't take long to figure out that no patron here works a 9-5 job - \"everyone here is either an artist or has a story\" as one of the regulars told me.  So yup, I came back for another visit.  If I was living in Montreal, you can call me 'Norm' here.  I'm already homesick for this place."}
{"text":"If I lived in Montréal, I could see myself visiting this bar regularly. It feels like a bar you might find in Ireland, rather than the US. Either way, I ordered the shrimp tacos and Portuguese sausage quesadillas and both were delicious. My favorite thing about the bar was the endless alcoholic beverage options. I ordered a Caipirinha (traditional Brazilian cocktail) and OMG, I'm still thinking about it."}
{"text":"Else's is always chill and cozy, dark, yummy and badass in a punk mamma full of community love kind of way. It's at its best in the winter right after a big snow. The small corner it sits on is the perfect place to watch the coordinated massive machine ballet of Montreal snow removal. Nice scotch collection and beers on tap, tasty samosas and nachos and other little snacks - you have to order the eats to get the booze so they are not crazy spectacular but they are delicious, unpretentious and cool just like everyone who works and drinks and writes tucked into this friendly local institution."}
{"text":"I feel torn about Else's, I love the atmosphere and the fact that although it seems to be packed, there always seems to magically be place to sit. Its a quite bar, low music, low lighting and a good selection of whiskey. BUT due to permits and licensing you have to order food in order to be served alcohol. They keep this because many of the patrons think its charming. You can order a small treat for about 4 dollars. The first time I went only 1or 2 people in our group got food and it was fine, the last time I visited they made EVERYONE order. If it wasnt for that small rule I would visit more often, especially since my favorite time for a drink is after dinner."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a party of 6 and were seated immediately. We ordered the pulled pork sliders, shrimp tacos, roasted veggie salad, and bison sliders. All were outstanding! This was not your typical bar food. The space was snug, but provided a cozy, warm environment. The service was exceptionally attentive and they had a fine selection of drinks and draft beers. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Else's the place to be.   And I don't mean it in a scenester or hipster sort of way. It's just an awesome venue where all of the key elements that makes a good bar great can be found here. That's why Else's THE place!   I loved everything about it: great ambiance, unpretentious, relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff and great music. My friend and I arrived when the band finished their set but one of Else's patrons decided to tickle at the piano keys near the back of the bar and played a few tunes. It was impromptu and fun. Else's that kind of place.   In terms of libation, they have a great Scotch list but instead, we opted for the cold cider. It was a local brew and unfortunately I can't remember the name of it but it tasted crisp, refreshing, and not too sweet. Their food menu is good and simple: from salads to nachos, and other healthy options. I had their veggie samosas, which were delicious.   I would have loved to returned to Else's to spend more time there but it was my last night in the city. Of course, this only means I have to return to Montreal very soon, which is not a bad thing all!"}
{"text":"Our daughter is a regular here and brought us here for lunch today. We've eaten our way from California (we're from LA)  through Mexico and the shrimp and pork tacos at Else's were among the best we've had. The mini bison burgers with that amazing coleslaw were a big thumbs-up too. Absolument délicieux - on recommande un pichet de sangria avec votre repas!"}
{"text":"Endroit où l'on peut manger jusqu'à 2h am. Le service était formidable, l'endroit était très agréable et la bouffe était bonne en plus d'être offerte à prix très raisonnable. Un endroit où je retournerai volontier pour un \"late diner\". Belle ambiance cosy."}
{"text":"This quaint place is off the beaten track - St. Laurent and Roy.   It's a really great place, dimly lit with bar specials from 5 - 8h. You can get 2 drinks for $10, I opted for rye and ginger. They also have some great food offerings I chose the bison burgers with beets and blue cheese. It wasn't bad, fair enough for $10. My boyfriend got the large vegetarian quesadillas, this was huge, served with a side salad and generous amounts of salsa and sour cream. There were lots of other options, including vegetarian dishes such as butter tofu and an asparagus salad.   This place has a really great vibe and a super cool story of it's conception. Be sure to read the story of Else on the back of the menu, it's pretty interesting!"}
{"text":"I wish I could stay in Montreal longer...just to visit Else's! Honestly, it has 100% been the best part of my trip. By Day 3 of this visit, I had basically resigned myself to being treated like sh*t everywhere I went, because I'm American AND I don't speak French. I came upon these reviews and went to check it out.  What a relief from all the nose-in-the-air attitude! Everyone was friendly, helpful, and kind. The house cider was so lovely on a rainy day, and the plates are perfectly sized.   If you miss real coffee shops from the 90's, this place will take you back--in the very best way. Not to sound corny, but...you can really feel the spirit of the proprietor and the relationships she developed, in the way that locals make themselves at home and interact with one another here. I wish I could have met Else...I want to be just like her, when I grow up.  p.s. This is also apparently where the hottest silver foxes in Montreal go to hang out. Wish I'd had a little more courage on that front...maybe I can squeeze in one more visit before I go!"}
{"text":"After four years at McGill, Else's is still in my top 3 for favorite bars. Not only are there multiple strings of Christmas lights (obsessed) but my friends and I sometimes just went there for some of the best nachos I've ever had. Lots of different beer choices (i.e., the Snakebite and Golden Velvet were mixes of beers with Guinness and cream ale.. delicious). The music was always fantastic, and the servers were always polite and crush-worthy. A little off the beaten path, but that only added to its appeal. Lots of different groups of people there, and free wifi during the day!"}
{"text":"Else's has a great atmosphere and was a very enjoyable experience.  I ordered the vegetarian tacos which were delicious, and finished things off with the chocolate brownie ice cream sandwich.  Not to be missed!  The staff were very courteous, friendly, and helpful.  I really enjoyed the experience and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Many pubs have good food, fewer have good deals (Happy Hour pints 5.75), even fewer have a story and charm such as Else's.   It feels like a cosy hole-in-the-wall with charm and friendly staff that are sure to delight. Great selection of beers and devour inside is unique and eccentric"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice date place. Good beer selection. My only qualms are that the service has been pretty bad on several of the occasions that I've been here, and you have to order food to drink (although that's a pretty minor issue, as they have some cheap dishes to get around that). I'd recommend if you're looking for something relaxed and don't mind waiting for service."}
{"text":"Been here twice and stayed till closing both times. Good beer, great scotch selection, and good bartending. Seems to be a favorite with the locals, and as some previous reviewers mentioned, the atmosphere is what makes it. Just come by and hang out and you'll enjoy yourself. Apparently they don't actually have a liquor license, just a restaurant license, but they seem to get by just fine."}
{"text":"I love it here! The atmosphere is chill, the staff is amazing, and the food is to die for! You won't get food this good at such great prices anywhere else. In particular, the shepard's pie is next level! I actually don't even like shepard's pie, but this is like nothing I've ever had. Cheesy, bacon-y, and oh so yummy!  My boyfriend and I have literally tried every single thing on the menu with only one thumbs down, the nachos. They were just ok. Everything else about this place is great though! And they have an awesome extended 5-7."}
{"text":"What a great simple place. Friendly staff, laid back vibe make for a great place to hang off of Roy street. I really loved the story of Else the owner. Only had drinks, though you need to order food. The menu is really reasonable in terms of pricing. Checkout my pictures to see options and cost for food and drinks. Will update my review the next time I eat there."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink before dinner (at Icehouse) a few weeks back, and it's a great little bar. From what I hear it's a Montreal institution, and it's easy to see why.  I had a few of their great selection of scotch (single malts), and the pours were friendly and reasonably priced. My girlfriend had a few of their mixed drinks, and they were all good too.  When we were there the place was busy but not packed. The table and chair setup is good, but we sat at the bar. It was comfortable and easy to talk. I can see how in the warmer months, with the big windows open, this would be a great spot for an afternoon drink.  I will definitely be back for another round (or two) when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Else's multiple times and it never disappoints.   Affordable, decent food and drink, this is a great spot for a date or a meet-up with a few friends. It's cozy, dark and candlelit (so everyone looks good), low key atmosphere, and the music isn't too loud so you can have a conversation over your meal (the establishment requires you to order food if you are drinking alcohol).  My favorite dish would be the fish tacos or the veggie tacos. I also like their simple beer selection and I've never had a cocktail I didn't like here. The wait staff are all very polite and knowledgable.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cute, local place to grab a few drinks and have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This bar has the best atmosphere. Cute blue outside, dark and intimate inside, with ivy and a collection of audio tapes on the walls. Free wifi for studying during the day, and delicious food and drinks at night. Else's has a homey, neighborhood atmosphere but is also very welcoming. It's a great place for a date or a chill night out with friends, and the excellent music they play is an added bonus. I would give this place 5 stars because it is one of my favorites in the city save one fact: their liquor license requires you to get food if you are getting alcohol as well. While their nachos are the best I've ever had (seriously, I dream about them), it is easy to rack up quite a tab as their pints are slightly more expensive than average. Since sometimes I only want a drink and no food, I've had to forego many trips to this place, and it is something for potential patrons to keep in mind when they visit. Even so, it's a phenomenal and cute bar that is definitely worth a visit...or ten!"}
{"text":"Regardless of whether you're with a friend, your laptop, or a newspaper, Else's is the perfect place to spend endless laid back hours on easy afternoons or evenings to the sounds of jazz and Beck. The unique forest green arched interior gives the sense of being in grandeur while eclectic decor is melanged with exotic cacti and memorabilia from yesteryear such as an over sized poster advertising for a Manet exhibition. One need look no further than your own table top to start though, as each tiny round is decorated with a different print, pattern, or painting.   While the menu is predominantly (and impressively) libation-centric, the food options of open-faced sandwiches and and other snacks make perfectly tasty and cheap accompaniments. The Delhi Belly featuring  pakoras, pita wedges, chickpea dip, balsamic dressed greens, and a veggie samosa is hands down my platter of choice."}
{"text":"Wow, just walking by, liked the look of it and boy were we rewarded! Seems a very neighborhood place, but very interesting food and flavors.  Raves from our party on everything on the menu, and finally a decent IPA in Montreal !"}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance of this place and the hot apple cider is amazing!  The food is what you'd expect for any bar.  In all it is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Un petit bar de quartier tout à fait abordable et qui change de l'ordinaire. La carte repas est quelque peu limité mais chacun trouvera quelque chose qui lui conviendra, tant un traditionnel fish and chips que des dumplings frits. Malgré la musique un peu forte, il est possible de s'entendre parler.   De plus, l'endroit est décoré jusqu'aux moindres recoins, nos yeux trouverons quelque chose à observer tant au plafond que sur les murs!"}
{"text":"Bar de quartier très cool ! Si on veut y boire, il faut aussi manger, ce qui se fera sans peine car c'est plutot bon et vraiment abordable. Le vin maison est bon également."}
{"text":"Very nice place to hang drink and eat. The prices are reasonable and the portions are on the small side. Tried the pulled pork and bison burgers. Both were good and homey.  The service is great. Attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Selon les avis précédents, je n'étais pas certaine à quoi m'attendre, mais je savais que ça allait être un endroit que j'aimerais. J'ai été surprise une fois rendue à l'intérieur de voir que c'était un mix entre bistro romantique pour un rendez-vous entre amoureux qu'un pub relax pour prendre une pinte avec sa gang de chums. J'ai été super contente de voir que leurs spécialités incluaient plusieurs variations de drinks à base de cidre (j'addoooorre le cidre!) en plus d'une belle liste de scotch et whiskeys pour plaire à mon copain. Les prix sont corrects et le service est vraiment bien. On était assis au bar, donc j'avoue que c'est assez simple d'avoir un bon service dans ce temps là, mais disons que le beau sourire des barmaids n'a pas passé inaperçu."}
{"text":"MUST try the warm citrus infused calamari salad. It is the best salad I have ever had hands down!  Simple and fresh. Calamari is not fried. The beans and calamari was cooked perfecto! Also this Salad has a kick to it so kudos on that! Great atmosphere and hanging out with the locals! Ask for Vanessa, she took great care of us! Just come chill here!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little local bar.  You have to buy food with your drink order (That's at least what the bartender told me).  Anyhow it was all very good.  Friendly atmosphere.  Going back."}
{"text":"I loooooove bars like these. It's a place where, as Johnson said, anyone can be here. I visited after work, I visited after school. I can look like a bum wearing my puffy winter jacket and eating, because it was so cold. It really doesn't matter.   Other customers of this bar are fantastic. I see all sorts of people. Everyone is friendly. The troublemakers and the clumsy patrons are friendly. The staff are friendly. Love the beers and only $6-7 for a pint! I couldn't help but stay 2 hours longer than expected, even though a long night of assignments awaited me.  Food was delicious. $10 for 2 sliders.  The lights at the back of the bar is extremely bright. Way too bright!! Sitting near the front is ideal for me.  Else's is like a dive bar, but very clean. It's almost undiscoverable if it wasn't for Yelp."}
{"text":"A very cool place where you can find all walks of life. I have lived around the corner for the last 10 years and have had met both friends, colleagues (realtors) and clients here. What I like about this place and why I recommend it, lets start with the story, Elses namesake a way cool chick who decided to open up a bar in the Plateau at a time when the plateau was filled with one of two categories, either Portuguese families, or all the bohemians living on the plateau back when it was really cheap, she was part of the founders of the plateau in my mind  .  I first moved to the plateau over 20 years ago, when you could find an apartment at the rate of 100$ per room, so if you had a 4,5 it would cost 450$, needless to say that at the price the people living there were able to move from one place to another easily, there were tonnes of these cheap rentals and the vibe was all about moving every year, vs having to paint (not kidding it was too easy).    No one had money but everyone lived for dirt cheap and went out all the time to neghborhood places that sprang up randomely like elses, the vibe was about doing whatever you wanted (which is why she is considered a rebel, see this is restaurant according to the permit, so she must sell food, but let's be real, it's a pub where you buy chilly.    Just so you know this place can drop some serious names, I have seen poiltiicans, high end business execs, and once even someone like Will Ferrel  they are mingling in the casual place with other regulars who simply spend their entire lived there The place it around for reason it just too cool a place to not try sometime. Elses is great anytime of the day, night or and yearound have fun"}
{"text":"Had the tacos here and thought it was pretty good. Was with some friends who tried other things on the menu, and they seemed to enjoy it as well. The prices are also pretty good for what it is. The service was a bit slow besides drinks, likely because it's a bar. The ambiance is nice, they have dim lighting around the place which can be nice depending on what vibe you're going for but I thought it was a little too dark (reason why this review doesn't have pictures posted)."}
