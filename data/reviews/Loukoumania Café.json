{"text":"My first time having this dessert and is it ever so delicious. Service is very friendly and they explain the dish well. The taste is mind-blowing, unlike some overhyped you see nowadays. This is quality. 

Yep I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great tasting Puffs with different flavour combos! Worth a look if you're into pastry and donuts."}
{"text":"This is my first time having Loukoumades. These little bites of joy destroy Timbits, cream puffs and even Tiny Tom donuts!!! I'm completely hooked! There's tones of choices for flavours/toppings, traditional cinnamon is great but try adding real bacon bits to bread and honey... ya it's alright!!!! Lol.  I think they've only been open 3 days and I've been there twice. 

Aside from the delicious treats, the coffee was amazing and the staff are so polite and don't mind explaining what you're about to get yourself into when you have one of these heavenly things. 

This is a great addition to the community and free wifi and comfortable chairs isn't a bad addition either.  10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I'm so amazed with this cafe,

Keep up the great work loukoumania xoxox"}
{"text":"When my dining companion suggested hitting Loukoumania Caf√© for dessert during a recent outing, I was immediately excited. I'm pretty sure I'd had this venerable Greek dessert before, but an entire restaurant devoted to it? Color me intrigued.

We walked in around 1:00 on a Monday and the place was empty. The menu was a little intimidating, but the super friendly clerk helped us make sense of it all. I decided to go with the 3 Loukoumades W/Ice Cream option, and elected to forgo any additional toppings and just get them the traditional way.

We were warned that the Loukoumades are made fresh every time, so the 15 minute wait for the food wasn't terribly surprised. And boy were they worth the wait.

The Loukoumades themselves are pretty much the best thing ever; hot and fresh, they're deep-fried balls of deliciousness covered in a delectable honey sauce. Honestly, I have no complaints about these things. They're astounding.

The ice cream, on the other hand, didn't fare quite as well. It's basically soft serve, but it was awfully icy and lacking in a creamy flavor. I ate a few mouthfuls and threw the rest away.

But those Loukoumades... I'll be dreaming about those things."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite donut shop... they have over 31 flavors, every time I try a new one I still have to get the original, cinnamon sugar. I've been here a couple times, they make everything fresh, so there is a wait definitely, but it's well worth the wait. If you must bring it home for your buddy, you are definitely missing out, I would suggest taking one out and eat it when it's still freshly hot and crispy...this is when I say to you, betcha can't just have one. writing this review make my tummy growl."}
