{"text":"While a bit on the expensive side, the food is decent, the service is fast, and there's a lot of seating.

To order, you circle what you want on a paper menu and your food arrives in a few minutes. It's a good place for a quick sit down lunch. I would recommend the rice plates. The pho is so-so, good enough if you need a fix. There's also a variety of Asian drinks like bubble tea, mango slush etc.

There's a patio in the back and inside the restaurant there's a lot of light and a lot of tables."}
{"text":"It looks like I've become the duchess of this place without even posting a review yet. Oops. Sorry Yelp. 

Hue's is a good place to eat if you want a quick meal for cheap. The food isn't true Asian fusion but they compensate with big portions. :) I don't like the pho or most of the rice dishes but that's just because I'm partial to the hot and sour soup (which isn't hot, but is sour). The name doesn't really fit... it's really more of a tomyum with noodles...but god it's good.

If you get dishes with meat options: Beef is boring side, chicken is dry, seafood is frozen crap, ALWAYS get the grilled chicken. It's really tender and they do something with it that makes it super flavorful.

Service is hit or miss. If you get the awkward white guy, don't expect too much. The girls with the ripped jeans are the worst though. (I get it's a casual place, but c'mon, you can dress nicer for tips at least.) The older ladies are definitely the best. 

CAUTION: Although they have pretty nice decor (patio) this place isn't that thorough with cleanliness. Most of the times, my table will have soup splatters or something that was left over from before. Check your napkins and utensils before you use them and avoid dirty areas on tables. The menus also are pretty gross and overly used. If you're lucky you'll get a new one that isn't all crinkled up from water stains, but again they aren't that careful with wiping them clean. (if you don't believe me, take a look at my pix)

4 for the hot and sour soup but the cleanliness and service brings it down to a 3.

I'll still be back though :)"}
{"text":"Firstly the waiter took the wrong order (Vermicelli with Pork and springroll, they brought a Pork Chop with some red Vermicelli...not sure what it was), he then didn't bring me chillies and was sitting in the corner texting instead. The food itself was burned and over salted - which may have been because they were trying to rush the mistake. The place was empty - over priced for what I got. A new waiter took over the bill portion, and even though I pointed out what a horrible job the other waiter did (in a nice way) he just said \"I guess he is new\". Bad food, bad service, so many other better places close by."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered the Bun Bo Hue since I figured it should be their specialty. The soup wasn't spicy enough and was bland, probably because they're trying to cater to Westerners. Also, the \"large\" size wasn't very big.

There was a table of two young Chinese guys beside me and they both ordered the green tea bubble tea. Both took one sip of their drinks and didn't finish the rest. I'm assuming the drinks didn't taste very good.

The thing that bothered me most was that the older lady (who I assume is/was the manager) was berating her workers in front of the customers. She was giving out orders on what to do and how to do it. It's fine if you have to instruct your workers but don't do it in the front dining area where all the guests can see. All of the wait staff at Hue Kitchen were visibly frazzled and stressed. They weren't communicating with each other and orders were missed or filled multiple times.

All in all it was not a pleasant dining experience. Look for an another place if you're craving Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I work nearby Hue's Kitchen, so it's not unusual for me to come here for lunch with my coworkers once every couple of weeks. The restuarant is very spacious, and can easily accommodate larger parties (I once made a booking for 30 people!) 

My very first time here was about 3 years ago, and I have to say ever since it has been slowly going down hill. They used to serve the best AAA quality beef in their phos (it was even advertised in their menu!), but I've begun to see the quality of their food deteriorating. I don't even think they put AAA on their menu anymore. Prices have gone up, and the portions have decreased. I used to be able to eat a small and be full, but now I have to order a large.

Sadly though, this may still be the best pho option around the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"Pho (large) - I counted 4 pieces of beef. Four. Less noodles vs Ginger. Saltier soup. $7.99.
Best pho in the city? Oh gee I don't know, you decide. Extremely disappointed.
Most dishes here have smaller servings vs Ginger, while more expensive.

However, the grilled chicken was grilled perfectly.
The decor was alright, nothing special or too memorable.

If you feel like shelling out tons of money for several servings of food per person, here is the place.

The first thing I thought when I saw the food was \"I should have went to Ginger instead\""}
{"text":"I was also drawn in by the claim for the \"best noodle soup\" in Toronto and that is why I've given it one star. Hue's was, to date, the worst noodle soup I've had since moving here.  The pho is done with a thicker rounder noodle (which you cannot pick up with round plastic chopsticks to get the noodles to the spoon and to your mouth.) The chicken had huge chunks of ligament and gristle on it and had that greasy sickening chicken taste of being reheated in the microwave. Also, it came already dressed with a few onion slices and no basil anywhere to be seen. No circulating hot sauce or hoisin to be found anywhere in the restaurant to punch up the taste.

The menus were so worn and over used that they are actually just filthy dirty. Service was awkward and unhelpful. When you can get decent, average noodle soup on almost every single street block in Toronto it says a lot to get one that is below average."}
{"text":"Hue's Kitchen at Yonge & Bloor is Asian fusion fast-food on the cheap. It is not particularly exceptional cuisine, but there is no better place for a quick business or lunch-break bite to eat in the area than Hue's. 

Hue's somehow manages to bring together a predominantly Vietnamese menu with Thai options, and also, strangely, Indian (or rather, butter chicken). 

Over the lunch hour (not at dinner), one marks down a menu card with their orders, and hands it to the server. All menu options are listed. This is important because it significantly cuts down on service time. My go-to is to choose a simple starter, for example, standard chicken spring roll or tom yum soup (less than $4), and then select one of the curry dishes with chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp. You then choose your \"side\": pad thai, udon noodles, jasmine rice, vermicelli. 

Once your server picks your order up, you order(s) will be in front of you in less than five minutes. THIS is where Hue's gets it right. It is always fast, now matter how many people are packed into the upstairs, main floor, and in summer, back patio. 

Hue's is not for those seeking anything more than a quick basic Viet/Thai/Indian lunch at a very inexpensive price point. On average, I am in and out of there in the span of 30 minutes, and my bill rarely exceeds $12-13, including the 15% tip I typically leave.

My four stars are thus not entirely reflective of the average food, but of the speed and price. Ideal for those of us in a rush and whom would still prefer a sit-down meal, in the Yonge & Bloor area, they can't be beat."}
{"text":"Small menu and food not that good. I will not be returning here anytime soon. The only reason they get one star is because they were quick to refill the water."}
{"text":"They have new copies of menus, so you no longer have to look at the crumpled and dirty menus.
I only had pho here. It is never great nor bad. It tastes rather artificial and inauthentic, as the soup is quite sweet, but hey, you get what you pay for. 
Decor is nice, and it is clean, and they bring the food out fast. Also very affordable."}
{"text":"Great experience, 

We go there all quite often since it's nearby. The food is great, I usually get the sweet and sour or the pad Thai. The rolls are a must as an appetizer. 

Not a big fan of the Bubble tea though. Other than that, the prices are very reasonable. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good asian fusion cuisine at an affordable price but it seems the quality has taken a nose dive. Today I order \"my usual\", fried vermicelli with chicken, beef and shrimp with crispy roll. I was so disappointed I will never order from here again. Parts of my chicken were pink, the 2 pieces of shrimp were overcooked and the beef was really fatty and chewy in parts. But the most disappointing thing was the crispy roll. I almost lost a tooth biting into this. I found 3 chicken ligaments in my roll. So Gross. Yuk! Thank god I didn't chip a tooth or bite my tongue. Let me just say How surprised I was to bite into my roll and find these in there."}
{"text":"I was having a good time on their lovely back patio....... until I came across the cockroach cooked into my curry. They barely apologized and did not take the item off the bill or offer anything else. Cool......... 

Never again."}
{"text":"The flyer was left in my mailbox, so I decided to give it a try. Considering that there is a GOOD Pho place (Pho Asia 24) four doors down from Hue's, one would think that they would try a little bit harder to compete. Pho is supposed to come with sprouts and sauces - Hue's didn't.  The Pho was bland, and not very good at all. The vegetable rolls were ok... but were dripping in oil. I understand that they are supposed to be oily, but this was over the top. They also sell a confusing mix of Indian food, which if they want to be a Vietnamese restaurant, the Pho should be priority #1

The exterior to the restaurant is beautiful, and it really cleans up this area of King St. W, but if you are looking for Pho, I would suggest eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Since moving to Toronto last year, Hue's Kitchen is perhaps the place my wife and I have returned to the most.

What impressed us early on is the staff, which is just lovely.  It wasn't long before one person in particular noticed us returning and struck up a rapport with us.  For that to happen in a busy downtown Toronto restaurant is nothing short of impressive.  What's more, the staff is honest to the point that, on one occasion, our server convinced me NOT to get the dessert because she didn't feel it was good enoguh to serve -- it was frozen and not fully thawed yet.  She cared more about our experience and enjoyment there than about money.  Wow!

Not that frozen dessert would have spoiled things too much (and usually the dessert is pretty great and ready-to-serve).  The proper dinner selections are very tasty and the portions quite plentiful.  My wife's go-to dish is the pho, while I love the grilled beef/chicken combination with noodles.  Our food is always served promptly (never more than a 10-minute wait) and we have plenty of space to ourselves to enjoy it.  The atmosphere is great for a night out, and now that it's summer we're looking forward to trying out their patio."}
{"text":"Gist:
Amazing Patio. Decent Food. Inexpensive eats & drinks. Did i say amazing patio?

Dish to Try:
- Pork Chops with Pad Thai Noodles
- Beef & Chicken Udon Fried Noodles

Drink to Try:
- Create your own fresh juice blend
- Alcohol - it's all cheap

I\"ve been coming to Hue's Kitchen for a couple years. Its a fast cheap eat. The food gets a pass, but isn't remarkable. 

What is remarkable is their patio, in the summer it feels like an garden oasis hidden from a sea of concrete at Bloor and Yonge. 

It's a convenient location and I often catch up with pals here. It's a relaxed place, the food and drinks are inexpensive. 

Factoring food quality, price, ambiance and location is why i give it  4 stars. It is great overall value. Keep you service expectations low, they are very friendly, but not so attentive. I don't fuss over it because i'm with good company having great conversations. I view this place like a cafe that happens to have hot made to order food with cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap, hard to find that combination in this part of the city that isn't fast food. Nicely renovated, good atmosphere. I get the chicken Pho usually."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch after finding out that the KFC near Yonge/Bloor doesn't serve chicken (true story...).  Place is pretty standard -  cheap, greasy, kinda tasty, and filling. My roommate got their house noodles bowl (their claim is \"best noodle soup\") and said it was pretty good. Not much else to say ;)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend during the week, place was nearly empty and we couldnt figure out why. it turns out there is a lovely back yard patio and THAT's where all the diners were. Next time!

On to the food: I ordered the green curry chicken with extra vegetables (bc really, there are never enough veggies!) and brown rice, a mango smoothy. My friend ordered the lemongrass chicken with brown rice, a strawberry smoothy and an order of yam tempura rice paper rolls which we split.

The food came super fast and was piping hot. I cant comment on the lemongrass, but my curry was excellent, with only one comment: LESS RICE PLEASE! I have trouble with portion control, and honestly, no one needs to eat 2 cups of rice in one sitting. While it was super yummy, Im regretting my inability to put down the fork. (Yes, I know this is my issue and not theirs, but for once it would be nice for restaurants to serve normal sized servings of food instead of Ginormo-humungo-norteamericano sized ones.)

Will I go back? Yup. You betcha. I'll just have to remember to bring a takeaway dish to take home some of that rice in."}
{"text":"This inexpensive resto right by Yonge/Bloor is a staple of mine.

Summer dining is ideal and they have a beautiful shaded back patio which takes you away from the city for a little while.

Pho (large for $8) is decent, although they aren't as generous with their portions as Golden Turtle or Pho Hung. For $9 you can get a shrimp skewer, grilled chicken and some Pad Thai-esque noodles that is more filling and feels like a bargain. Salad Rolls ($2) are A-OK, but I have always found the Spring Rolls to be too oily.

It also seems to be a favourite spot for large groups which can easily be accommodated with banquet seating throughout although they're usually placed towards the back right by the garden. Service wanes (as does noise) a bit when they have groups."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers. Their patio is hidden and pretty. The ordering is easy, they served fast, and the prices were decent. They even had our bills ready before we left.

I had the Beef vermicelli with a spring roll. Decent, though Ginger is better, but if you want a restaurant presentation for the same price it's the place to go."}
{"text":"Hue's is like the newer, slightly prettier sister of Ginger, although just not as good. 

Hue's is basically across the road from Ginger on Yonge and shares a very similar menu. (Same owners). The food is decent, and reasonably priced. I have eaten here a number of times, but primarily for the back patio. The patio is an oasis and a welcome addition to the Y&B corridor. 

Just like Ginger, the food is not really Vietnamese, although here it is even less. A fusion of Vietnamese, Thai, Western and Indian appears on the menu, which is broad, granted, and slightly disorganized.

Best are the terrifically inexpensive fresh rolls with a myriad of choices. Worst are any of the Overly-saucy-sweet Tofu + choose side dishes. The Bánh mì (Sandwiches) are particularly poor value.. even for the low price.

For Lunch you can get in and out pretty quick, if you are not basking in the sun on the patio. It is not as quick as Ginger, not nearly as organized,  and the bus people here are much crankier despite the more elegant surroundings.

After work forget it altogether. I came here for \"spring rolls and a beer\" with a girlfriend that had some time to kill between appointments and the service was unbelievably awful. We would order a bottle of beer each, she'd bring ONE. The other would take 20 min. We'd ask for more, she'd forget.. Two beers and spring rolls took 1.5 hours, even though we ordered at the cash on the way in. 

Good Patio, Good \"Fusion\" Food if you have a very western palate. One star is for the Patio."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Awesome service and very chill. MSG is real but it's totally worth it. 

Red curry with chicken is where it's at here."}
{"text":"Cheap, you order and pay at the counter. Food was okay.  I looked at the take out menu which said \"we can cook without MSG at your request\" which surprised me."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special.  But with very nice patio/indoor seating choices, good service and cheap bubble teas, hot chocolate, full bar, good mango salad, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"who? hue.

Everything is better with Bana. Our impromptu lunch date landed us at Hue's Kitchen.  I had heard it was good.

It is for it is.  Fast, cheap, good food.  

Honourable mention to the rolls - salad and fried.  Both tasty and cheap.  I also need to point out the terrasse, sorry, patio...it is lovely and totally unexpected.

At $1.50 I should have ate 10.
 
 My lunch was the pho, bad choice; butter chicken roti, better choice. And it's $5.99, what! 

Apart from the communication mishap Bana and I experienced it was an easy lunch: in-eat-out.

Hue's secured a spot on my lunch draw.  And that my friends, is a good thing."}
{"text":"Fast food Vietnamese is as good as it gets for a place that is probably an OK lunch spot, but not much else. Very busy and servers seemed to be confused much of the time over who got what. If you can grab lunch anywhere else south of Bloor/Younge that looks decent, do it and skip this place. Go here if you're told there are no tables elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time, I believe this place and Ginger are owned by the same people. At one point early on after they opened they had Ginger's logo on their menu. Their food is very similar to what they have at Ginger, casual Vietnamese fare (Pho, noodles, rice dishes, Vietnamese sandwiches). It took them a little while to work out the kinks in their menu, if my memory serves correctly, I believe they originally had steak or burgers on their menu. Most of those items are gone, they do have some random items still on their menu like butter chicken, but overall its almost exactly like Ginger. I used to get their salad rolls, spring rolls, Vietnamese sandwiches, and combo meat noodle dishes which were all pretty good. My girlfriend used to get Pho from there alot as well, she said it wasn't the best but it was OK.  They also have cheap alcohol and smoothies there too, but it never seemed like a place where I would ask friends to go grab a drink.

Its pretty cheap, around $7-$10 for most of their main dishes, their sandwiches are cheaper (around $4) and so are their appetizers. I'd say its just slightly pricier than Ginger, but a much nicer atmosphere and you get table service. 

Side note: They did admit to putting MSG in their food once when we asked, but they said \"only a little bit\". So that's something."}
{"text":"This is a great fusion restaurant that blends Thai and Vietnamese food rather well.  The menu is limited, but that's a good thing as most of the choices are well rounded and tasty.  The atmosphere is nice and the back patio area is nice in the summer.  The staff are friendly, attentive and the food comes out rather quickly. 

I've had the pho and curry here along with the fresh and deep fried spring rolls.   I'd have to say the pho is alright, but compared to other Vietnamese places in the city it is a bit lacking.  The curry however was quite good and the portions were huge.  They definitely give you a large amount of food so you will be sure to be full by the end of your meal.  The avocado shake is also great and quite refreshing. 

Overall a great place to eat and the prices can't be beat in downtown Toronto.  I will definitely be coming back to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Hue's was... okay. It was really just okay. Went for lunch, had the beef pho and a shrimp cold roll. The cold roll was sliced and served in four chunks of varying sizes with a tangy dip that could have used some heat. The shrimp was limp and thin. Don't get me wrong, it was edible, but for the same money and a bigger roll I'd head to Ginger. 

The pho was pretty standard - no cilantro floating around and the bean sprouts were already well-cooked and flaccid instead of crispy when it arrived. Served with a teensy tiny wedge of lime, so if you go here, I hope you don't much care for lime. The small is a decent sized portion, however, and the beef was good, although not as thinly sliced as I like. 

Service was apathetic and scarce. We were two of about three full tables in a large restaurant, and had to ask for an initial serving of water about 15 minutes into being seated, and the bill arrived long before we had finished our lunch."}
{"text":"The Pho was ok and the back patio was alright, but the service was abysmal. My coworkers ordered different menu items and they all were very disappointed. When asked to reorder since one dish was terrible, we were told no. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I haven't had a decent Vietnamese place to eat in Toronto for a while I decided to eat at the one on Yonge Street. Had a bowl beef noodle soup which was decent enough to eat which was at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This so-called 'kitchen' is surviving on borrowed furniture. The previous restaurant, Saigon Sister was an actual restaurant with an actual full menu. They were the ones who set up the large glass windows, the modern wooden decor and the above average patio in the back. Once they flopped, this restaurant (which I think are the same owners) took over -again, inherited the decor and remodeled it as an upscale [sic.] option to Ginger, across the street. 

Nice, yet simple decor aside this place is really not very good. Sure the waiter is very friendly (and part of Movember, no less) however the food feels sub-par. Specially when a place like Ginger, selling Pho at $5.95 beats Hue's $7.95 pho in quality/taste hands down. Their cheap $1.50 crispy rolls where okay and my Spicy Soup, is literally the same pho broth with some spicy pepper oil thrown in... with some slabs of different beef and different noddles. However, the thicker noodles were tasteless and the hot paste seemed like it was added as an afterthought. There was no infusion happening here. 

Food for thought, if both places are cheap, why is it that Ginger is generally packed, while Hue's, with its superior decor remains next to empty almost everytime I have walked by, day or night?

All in all, I have been here three times, the first time, my brain tried to tell me something, a mild, quiet thought ringed in the back of my mind but I ignored it as the soup was not all that bad and I was giving the place the benefit of the doubt. The second time the company was good and I was distracted, however this last time, that thought was quite loud and perfectly clear... \"Next time, when in the hood, go to Ginger instead.\""}
{"text":"The sign up front is a lie.  Definitely NOT the best pho in town.  That said, it IS the best pho in the neighborhood and their quality of beef is far better and more consistent than what I've had at Ginger.

Service is usually very fast and as a result, it's become a mainstay for quick, out-of-office group lunches during the week. 

Patio is very secluded and absolutely beautiful during the spring/summer.  I wish there was some view of foot traffic on the street, but I can't complain given the location."}
{"text":"I had the beef pho noodle soup and a chicken spring roll, my boyfriend had the same thing except with grilled chicken! 
Standard pho, pretty good soup and the bean sprouts were already in the soup, not raw and on a plate on the side for you. There was a good amount of beef slices but no beef balls unfortunately! :( 
Decent price for downtown location ($7.50 for L), so our bill wasn't too much in the end! 
Most likely will come back for their other dishes. However, there are many other options in the area so we'll see! ;)"}
{"text":"Everyone seemed to have complained about the pho, so we stayed away from it.  We ordered the Hues Spicy Noodle soup which was absolutely delicious!  Both the noodles and the broth were tasty.  My friend had the lamb curry and I had the red curry.  Both were very good.  The price was right, service was a little slow, but definitely a good place for a reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem. Great food at very reasonable prices.  They have a patio in the back which you would think would command much higher prices... I recommend the grilled-chicken pho, but haven't been dissapointed by anything here."}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese, but I admire the simplicity of Vietnamese restaurants. Their dishes are practical, delicious, and don't break the bank. This restaurant gets 5 stars from me because it's a good combination of great price, good quality, and the place is not a whole in the wall. It's even close to a major intersection! 

I've been here 3 times. The atmosphere is passable for a date (compared to other pho restaurants). The food is delicious. Pho is a really simple dish so my expectations are not high. The biggest faux pas with pho to me is luke warm soup. This place has pho soup base at the right temperature. Unlike other places, they don't do S, M, L, XL. Their menu is a little different but it's all good. 

I've tried their rice and noodle dishes and haven't been disappointed. Like I said, Viet food is not about extravagance. This is simply a great place to get viet food. If I recall correctly, they have some Thai dishes as well and that's a bonus. So it gets 5 stars because it's as good as it gets. I think pho restaurants have it easy because they are so simple. I find it hard to deduct stars unless they did something terrible or if the food tasted funny."}
{"text":"Their food is ok, not great, not bad. I always feel rushed while eating there. The waitress/waiter will drop by like every 5 minutes asking you whether or not you're done, even when the place is pretty much empty! The second you put down the utensils they'll clean up the table so fast and give you the bill before you could even swallow the food. This has happened multiple times. I'm not sure if it's a norm or just bad luck for me, but I sure have had enough. Even at Ginger they don't rush you like that."}
{"text":"If you like Ginger, you'll like Hue's. Most similar to the Ginger near Church and Wellesley, Hue's serves up some quick Asian fusion that is tasty and affordable. 

Hue's is a more proper Ginger. Proper as in a proper sit down restaurant, not better. There are menus and servers unlike Ginger. The food choices are similar but are overall different. The quality is the same as Ginger but the presentation of the food is restaurant style.

I recommend the pork or beef subs. They are cheap and delicious. Just like a Vietnamese Bun, it's flavour every mouthful. I also recommend the spicy ox tail pho. It's not too spicy and it satisfies the pho craving.

Overall, Hue's is a good hybrid restaurant. You get a waiter but you pay at cash after wards. It's my go to place when I'm at Yonge and Bloor and want to save some cash on \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town?  REALLY?  This is what their sign says outside.  If this is the best pho Toronto has to offer, I'll stick eating my pho in the suburbs.  This place is always packed during lunch time with business types and not many people who live in the area.

I think this is a place where the business types are trying to be cool and hip by having \"Asian food\" even though this place is probably one of the worst pho's I've ever had.  That's not to say it's bad, it just doesn't compare to 99, Lac Vien, or 88.  The broth is very salty and like Rainie said before me, their meat is always overcooked for a pho place.  Not authentic at all as a lot of the meat in pho is supposed to be slightly cooked and then cooked in the broth itself.  Also, the broth doesn't come steaming hot like it should. It's more just hot.  

Verdict: if you want \"fusion\" pho - sure try it out, but if you want authentic - go somewhere else. Ginger is probably better."}
{"text":"I joined a meetup group here last night as the \"dinner\" part of a dinner and pub night.  It was a great choice and the restaurant did a fine job of accomodating our large 20+ something group.

Hue's Kitchen exists in this large category of \"cheap and cheerful\" pan Asian spots.  I think it does a bit better than most: the atmosphere was a little classier, it has a \"cleaner\" feel to it and the service was not rushed.

There was almost something on the menu for anyone: butter kitchen, pho and sushi-ish items are live together on a one-sides placement in harmony.  The fact that most everyone was about $10 or less made this spot really good for our meet.

I had the lemongrass tofu with vermicillie (sp?) noodles--totally what I expected and tasty.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their choices.

You may want to know that you may not get completely full on a dish here--I wasn't.  But then I usually can put away more than most.  

Its central location is fantastic.

I would recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner with friends.  By no means, a place to impress on that 2nd or 3rd date but it could work for a first casual meeting or once you are past the point of needing to impress one another.  And obviously this works for any kind of meet up style get together.  A-OK!"}
{"text":"Hue's Kitchen is a new vietnamese place that's opened in Parkdale.  Their food can be good, but seems to be inconstent (one day extremely good, the next very disappointing).  They also have issues with ordering, delivery and completeness of orders.  Food seems to go through the kitchen sequentially, hence large groups need to either wait (while their food gets cold) for the last dish to come out, or they eat and watch those served 10 minutes later finish.

I hope that Hue's can sort out their issues because when they're good, they're very good."}
{"text":"Pho here was surprisingly good. The broth was good, flavorful and not oily. Too little noodle to broth ratio (my mom would scoff!), but was filling enough. They put \"ngo` gai\" (sorry, don't know the translation) in, but no basil and the bean sprouts were already added. I had to ask for Sriracha and hoisin sauce (hmm...). Different than your typical pho experience, but still a good bowl of soup for a decent price. 
My favorite was actually the eggrolls (aka spring rolls). I could eat a whole lot of that. Yum.
Restaurant was clean and staff were nice. And there's a really pretty outside patio in the back. Can't wait for it to open."}
{"text":"Best cheap eats! Enjoyed the fried fish and mango as well as their vermacilli. The back patio is really nice!"}

{"text":"This restaurant had been renovated although Im The waitress was really attentive. 
The service was really good. The server often checked in on us.
The menu was predominately noodle soup dishes. I ordered beef pho. It took I believe 15 minutes for my order to arrive. The small noodle soup bowls were $6.75 for a small. Tasted good.
I believe the restaurant is gone due to the construction"}
{"text":"Cheap eats but not good. Lol gave 2 stars solely for the server that assisted me with my dry cough. She heard me coughing and provided me with ginger tea and honey. So sweet. 
Otherwise, would not return for the food. 
Looks like they have cheap beers for $3.75"}
{"text":"The patio in the back is a must for summer. Their menu needs updating. Their spicy soup was good but this restaurant is un memorable except for their awesome patio. Go in the summer!"}
{"text":"a few of us from our work went here for lunch one day. All i gotta say is MEH. I mean as far as asian cuisine goes its rampant in Toronto and this is not that good. There is one really good thing though, the beer is SUPER cheap. On multiple occasions i have contemplated going here for pre drinks before a night out on the town, but no one else seems to ever want to do that lol.  The food is sub par, i found my food to be to slimy and just did not look appealing. Not to mention the flavours of the food is super blan. Our server also did not write our order down and proceeded to screw up 2 of the 4 lol If you want to get drunk on a budget go here in the summer on there patio cause its a really decent size and pretty nice. But if you want a good meal, pass."}
{"text":"No better value than having a meal in their back yard on a sunny day.  In colder weather, the pho is the best remedy for what ails you.  Their salad rolls are fresh and not fried, although the tofu inside might be.  The ordering method is simple, using a crayon and order form.  Quite efficient although you have to line up to pay at the end.  Hurry up to try this place as construction next door might shut this place down soon!  That would be more than just a shame.  It would be a pho pas."}
{"text":"This place was terrible :(. Please consider going somewhere else. 

Stopped by for work lunch with a friend. We ordered chicken pho but got beef instead. The beef had mostly fatty cuts. To top it all off, when we were paying at the counter, a homeless man came in and took the food off our plates. The servers just laughed it off...Of course."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend. We always walked by it and there aren't many Vietnamese restaurants nearby (I think) so we finally decided to try it. I won't really take into consideration about price because I understand the area is a bit pricey for the rent in the area, so I understand.

I got their bun bo hue because I love them so much but this one, I didn't love too much. The soup was alright but it didn't taste like.. the broth has been cooked long enough or with enough spices, I'm not sure. It just felt lacking and it could've been made better.  I got a decent amount of meat so that wasn't a problem, that a lot of noodle soup restaurants seem to have. 

My friend got their hot and sour noodle seafood soup. I think there were 3-4 pieces of shrimp, a mussel maybe, some squid and possibly some fish meat. The soup was alright, it wasn't very spicy though either and I felt it was similar to my soup, not enough flavour and not enough time put into the broth. Vietnamese noodles are about the broth, if that's not good enough then it's just mediocre. 

But I'd like to point out that AT LEAST both our noodle soups came out boiling hot. For some reason this is hard for some restaurants. I've had lukewarm noodle soups and that's just disgusting. So thumbs up for this for this bare minimum.

We also shared the deep fried shrimp roll that came with fish sauce. It was crispy and the shrimp was tasty but the roll was folded weirdly so that the very edge of the rolls had no shrimp in it.. as if the shrimp slumped over to only one side of the roll. I'm just saying that they weren't very good looking or symmetrical but.. just that comment. Fish sauce was a little bit lacking too, maybe watered down a little I'm not sure."}
{"text":"I was somewhat surprised by this place on a first visit.   I came in a rather large group of 20 or so folks...we had reserved, but it's not that big of a place, so I thought they handled it rather well, although the food was pretty staggered.

First, of all for a relatively cheap \"Vietnamese\" place, the decor is pretty good.  Well-chosen pendant lights nicely illuminate the place and give it a welcoming spacious feel.  

The Food: 
It's officially a Vietnamese place, but I put that in quotes earlier since Pad Thai, naan, and some Chinese-sounding items end up on the menu. Have no fear, Pho is on offer, but it's pan-south(east) Asian in general.  I found their avocado salad roll to be rather tasty, although in somewhat short evidence of avocado.  Nonetheless, it was incredibly fresh and an excellent refreshing starter.   Likewise the main course of lemongrass beef was actually pretty well done and spiced with abundant lemongrass.  I like that they offer brown rice without trying to nickel and dime you with a surcharge for eating healthfully.  Everyone else around the table seemed pretty satisfied with their offerings.  The desserts were cheesecake and red velvet cake, and I tasted a bit...it seemed tasty but on the oily/dense side.

The Drinks:
Beer, wine, and liquor are cheap here...I had a pretty decent Tiger beer for $4.50 in a bottle.  Their offerings are limited to some Asian beers, the mass market beers, and Steamwhistle/Creemore on the \"premium\" side.  

I had an absolutely amazing avocado shake for my dessert. I was astonished how creamy and chlorophylly (probably not a word) this tasted, and it was an excellent way to end the meal.  They serve the sickly sweet Vietnamese coffee (a nice choice if you're in the mood), but it isn't served with the nice presentation one might see of coffee dripping through grounds at the table.  The avocado shake was worth at least half a star on its own.

The Service:
Decent for a large group, but they had some issues with timing.  Some people got their food after others had already finished.  To be fair, we came with 20 people at peak dinner hour.   Service, though, was polite, informed, and friendly; and, I don't believe there was a single screwed-up order.  

Overall, this place surprised me.  I'd seen some sub-par reviews and was a bit worried.  The salad roll and avocado shake were quite well executed and the lemongrass beef was a tasty value for the price.  It's not a very traditional Vietnamese place, but I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Not terribly impressed.  Yes, it is inexpensive, but it does not have all that many other merits.  The food is a sort of passable imitation of  Vietnamese and some other Asian cuisines.  The pho they rave about so much had kind of a weird tasting broth and other dishes were just so-so.  Get out of downtown and go to an ethnic Vietnamese conclave instead for better Vietnamense food.  Service was okay.   Atmosphere is nothing special either."}
{"text":"this place is right on par. i wasn't lured in by the sign outside that said best pho in town as i know this is just a marketing plow to lure in people who are not familiar to pho. those being of the non-asian race. my friend and i were hungry and it happened to be the option we were dealt because of it's proximity. 

hue not only serves pho but other Vietnamese fusion dishes as well. i settled for the oxtail soup and rare beef. the broth was yummy. it was not overly salty but had a calm flavorful tone to it. i could tell they put some effort into the broth and didn't just drench it with msg. the oxtail was good, it could have been cooked a little a bit longer so the meat would just fell off the bone. i had a little difficulty getting every nook of that tail. the rare beef was sliced a bit thick for my taste but the there was something rustic about it. it was pretty apparent they didn't use a meat slicer so i kind of appreciate that. the sides such as mint, water sprouts, etc. were oddly put into the bowl. normally it accompanies the pho and is added based on preference."}
{"text":"So alot of people complained about the pho but it was okay for me. Little below average but Ive had alot worst. It was great value tho which I appreciate and the size is good.

I liked the furnishing and renovation but its a shame there's alot of flies around the back where we sat. It really bothered us. 

What I had to say was that the service was really good. I really appreciated the young Asian woman who had to carry the pho out. The bowl was super hot! I used to work as a waiter so I am already accustomed to burning my hands often. She was very nice and did a good job."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I've had their pho (beef noodle soup) and every time I did, I was a bit disappointed. So really, my review is only on their pho. 

The soup was fine. The noodle was fine. The real problem is with the beef. Every time I order the dish, my beef came out overcooked and hard to chew. They either always overcook the meat or they choose a really bad cut of meat for pho. Either way, the meat always ruins the pho here for me. The prices are a bit higher than other restaurants too."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pho and I really enjoyed it. Having absolutely nothing to compare it to, the chicken was cooked well and the dish had great flavor. The cold roll was also delicious, I tried the avocado and yam one. 

Service was great, the staff were all very friendly. 

Only reason for not getting the 5th star is the bathroom... Very sketchy. Other than that, brilliant!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to have Pho and we didn't want to go to Ginger, so we decided to come to Hue. 
I didn't end up having Pho because of their very limited menu. I ended up having a shrimp spring roll and a curry lamb.

The shrimp roll was great, crispy, flavourful and fresh. The lamb, not so much. 

The rice and bok choy came on a large plate. A big pile of rice, and a sauce with it. The lamb came on a separate soup plate, and literally, there was only 2 pieces of lamb. t.w.o.

The lamb was good, despite the fact that the sauce was a little greasy, but the portion size is to be reviewed.

We then discovered a patio in the back and it looked awesome too. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the promise of awesome noodle soup, but ended up not ordering it because it was a warm summer day. The menu was a confusing combination of Asian fusion, a sure fire sign nothing was going to be particularly great and a factor in dissuading me away from the pho. I ended up with a combo of fried noodles, various meats and veggies and while it was decent on the variety, it was a bit muddled and monochromatic. The spring roll was pretty greasy, but hit the spot. I topped my lunch off with a Tiger beer (not bad) and a green tea bubble tea (delicious). Most of the patrons were solo eaters, like me, but I'm not sure what that says about the place. Ultimately, it was a middle of the road option for lunch during my day in Toronto alone."}
{"text":"I didn't like Ginger and I didn't like Hue's either.  This was the worst butter chicken and worst butter chicken roti I've ever had.  The chicken wasn't even cooked in the sauce, you can tell it was obviously cooked separately and it was dry.  The portion was also too small, which is really unusual for me since I get full really quickly.

My friend's dish was a noodle dish, and it was just spammed with noodles, I'm not even sure what kind of meat he had.

I had higher expectations for the mango smoothie since it was a staple item in Vietnamese restaurants.  I was disappointed, the mango used was the tart west-indian mango instead of the sweet, orange mango that's usually used for smoothies.  I finished it, it was too bad but I prefer the sweeter mango taste.  Again, the smoothie size was too small.

For the price, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a lot like the restaurant Ginger, except with an ambience.  Hue's Kitchen has a long list of thai and viet cuisine.  While the prices here are comparable to fast food, the decour and ambience say soooo much more!  

Located half a block south of Yonge and Bloor, the back patio is one of my favorate hideouts in the area.  The chicken and shrimp pad thai is very simple but still great.  What i love is the quality of chicken that this place uses and the amount of meat that comes in a $7 meal.  The fresh juices and appetizer rolls here pretty damn good too!  If you like iced tea, i recommend trying their house blend...unique and soo damn good!  For $10, your can pretty much get yourself a fresh juice and close to anything off the menu!  

For good value, great food and a quick escape from Yonge street, this place always keeps me coming back when im in the area!"}
{"text":"We came to Hue's looking for a cheaper alternative to some of the other places in the area, and we weren't disappointed. The venue is large and has ample seating, though if you go on a Friday or Saturday you may have trouble getting a nice table.

As for the menu, it tries to be all things to all people with a smattering of Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indonesian and Indian dishes. The food is fresh but not spicy and packs a ton of flavor. The location and it's wide offering only compounds the added value and I will definitely be going back regularly

Recommendations:

- Red Curry Chicken
- Sweet Mango Salad"}
{"text":"I know the waitresses can be absent minded sometimes or they make mistakes sometimes, but I really like this place! (Probably partly due to its convenient location at yonge&bloor), but I've always enjoyed the food here so that says something.

In particular I think their fruit smoothies are really great!!! (Esp the strawberry, mango and avacado smoothies). Their salad rolls are delicious (and cheap!!! 1.90). And I usually go for the spicy oxtail pho."}
{"text":"I am shocked that I haven't already written a review for Hue's...I eat here more often than any other restaurant (already eaten here twice this week alone). 

The main draw is definitely the pho.  Go with the grilled chicken and you won't be disappointed (but don't expect to get veggies in that...okay, so you might be a little disappointed if you were expecting veggies).  I wouldn't, however, do the seafood pho...the one time I had it I found that all the seafood (except the shrimp) was overcooked and rubbery.  

The service is speedy even when the place is packed (unless you're on the back patio...it's a lovely spot to sit, but they sometimes forget about you out there) and the waitstaff is also very friendly and accommodating.   

The fun thing about Hue's is that the pho isn't the only tasty part of the menu.  The only item I've ordered so far that I wasn't a fan of was the hot & sour soup (something about big chunks of tomatoes and pineapple floating around in broth was just unappealing...can't really put my finger on it, but ew).  I highly recommend that you go for the butter chicken roti or any of the salad rolls.

Oh, and If you're going to get a bubble tea? Have it in the restaurant - you get A LOT more than if you get it to go (found that out the hard way - I was finished my bubble tea before I got out the door).  The taro and the mango are both delicious options!"}
{"text":"This self described \"Viet-Thai & Fusion\" counter service eatery is a more recent addition to the many Asian fusion options on Yonge near Bloor. While perusing the menu outside of Hue's, my friend and I were greeted by the rush of savoury smells that came through the door as a beaming lady with an armful of take out stepped out and gushed about how excited she was to try it for the first time. With that, we were sold!

Once inside, the dark wood decor was more upscale than you'd expect. The closed off second floor and focal point chandelier seem to be reminants from a previous venture and probably wouldn't feel so out of place if you were coming for drinks instead of lunch or even dinner. The biggest surprise is the large back patio which is surrounded by vibrant leafy greens and a great way to enjoy the warmer weather.

The appetizing tofu and avocado salad rolls ($1.95 ea), filled with firm, almost bocconcini-creamy tofu were larger and tastier than the competition's. The incredibly fragrant coco shrimp ($7.25) was served with some of the most flavourful pad thai that comes as a side. Jasmine tea ($1.50), served in a cute little teapot, was a nice warmer-upper as the sun set, although there is a no-can-do policy for additional hot water.

I can't wait to come back to try their special caramel fish mango ($7.95)!"}
{"text":"Great place, a little hide away in the middle of a city. My husband and I enjoyed our Pho Soup and chicken skewers. Servers was very good and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"After having lunch at Hue's, my first thought was \"Shoulda gone to Ginger\".

We ordered the vermicelli with shrimps ($7.99) and the curry chicken on rice.  The vermicelli noodles were limp and loaded down with fish sauce.  The currey chicken was decent but not at all spicey.

Service was quick.  We were given a menu to check off our orders.  Food came quickly but lukewarm.

Not one of my favourite places for food in the area."}
{"text":"Why do the words \"asian fusion\" send shivers down my spine?

Anyway, this place is surprisingly decent for a quick lunch during working hours. Don't go out of your way to visit here, but if you work nearby it's an OK option. Food comes out quick and you can eat for under a tenner.

Decor is modern and the back patio is a nice leafy green space. Won't find many patios like that on Yonge St.

You get your regular \"Viet-Thai\" meal options - bad pho, \"thai\" curries, spring rolls, etc. You get to pick your fav rice/noodle option and can add extra veggies on the side for $1.25.

Place is PACKED at lunch but the service is quick."}
{"text":"I don't know how they were brave enough to put \"best noodle soup in Toronto\" on their front sign, since is really ridiculously not true.

Went there for lunch, wanting to try the reincarnation of Saigon Sister since I've had Ginger before, but was a bit disappointed. The decor is so modern, and so is there menu content, but something about this place just doesn't work.

Their menu reflects an attempt to encompass and infuse South East Asian food, and serve sorta fusion things like lemongrass chicken rotis and traditional things like pho and pad thai, which is a cool concept (sorta like spring rolls) but you seem to get very mixed and conflicted msgs about what they are trying to deliver. 

- The name of the restaurant and its sign tells me it's a vietnamese restaurant that predominantly serves pho
- It's decorated in a very modernistic and clean style, causing you to second guess that it's your typical viet restaurant
- Despite the modern decor, the service is completely Asian--brisk and to the point--and gave us our bill as soon as we finished eating without us asking for it
- There's with an Asian guy taking order, an old guy behind vietnamese sweet bar but it's oddly filled with liquor
- Their menu is nicely fusion and their food smells great, though my pho is mediocre.

I think I prefer Ginger"}
{"text":"Drawn in by the claim \"Best Noodle Soup in Toronto\" I stopped here for lunch. A few minutes after noon, it was positively chocablock with nine-to-fivers slurping away noisily. Fortunately, someone waved us upstairs, and me and my sister snagged un table pour deux.

The place is clean and fairly modern and features TWO (count 'em) two  chandeliers. The service was a little brisk, but I'm sure that's a result of the lunch time crowd. Our waitress was super friendly. You order by filling out a bubbled slip (like a Scantron sheet) with a red pencil. Food comes impossibly fast to your table.

The menu features crispy rolls, soup, rice/noodle platters and inexplicably, butter chicken. That's beyond pan-Asian. I wasn't messing around with naan, so I ordered the Spicy noodle soup with beef and pork. My sister got a chicken pho. 

Our crispy roll appetizers ($1.50 for a 4\" roll cut in two) was OK. As for the soup: best in the city? Not really, but still pretty good. Lots of noodles and chunks of beef. I would have liked the soup to be a) spicier and b) pork-ier, but hey, for $5.75 it was a decent value. And that was for the small portion which I barely (actually didn't) finish. I can't imagine what a large soup is like. (But that's because I am not imaginative.)

Solid value and service, and savoury offerings for lunch. I'd return.

Obligatory Title Pun: HUE is saturated with value. (That's one for the designers.)

Menu Readability: Oval menu with pictures.

Need to mention: You can get smoothys (sic) here also. My avocado smoothie was 3/5 at best.

What this place teaches me about myself: I love standardized testing! Don't you?"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a simple bowl of Pho. I had the grilled chicken pho - decent enough. Got a warm glass for my beer!! Room is dated but my server was very good. I come here for the simplicity - I'd never bring my wife here though."}
{"text":"MSG hit me about 2 hours after my meal.

Service was completely lacking to start.  

Food was okay, not great or good.

Meh City."}
{"text":"I used to love this place back when it was called \"Saigon Sister\", I used to take out beef pho and beef rolls, really tasty! Now the pho is somehow wattered down, less flavourful, prices are gone up, authentic options have dissapeared from the menu. I like the patio though. Good location, dissapointing food."}
