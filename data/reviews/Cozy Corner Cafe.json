{"text":"Finally found my favorite breakfast spot. Best breakfeast food I've tasted in arizona."}
{"text":"I am a ten-year + \"regular\" and I appreciate good food and good service. You get both here. The place is family-owned and they work for their customers because the business depends on their efforts.
The emphasis is on flavor, and the cooking is old-school diner style all the way. The cooks know what a medium egg is, and the bacon is applewood smoked. The biscuits and gravy are deeply flavored, the ham steaks oversized.
On Friday nights, try the prime rib dinner of the fish fry.
Not everyone is born with good taste, but you can find it here.
Stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good service. Breakfast was excellent. Biscuits and Gravy are my breakfast devining rod and the ones I got here were very peppery and generously laced with sausage. The biscuits were light and flakey. My Brother Bob got the skillet with Chorizo and enjoyed it. Said the chorizo had a bit of a kick to it. Menu says it's homemade. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"If your looking for that perfect little Mom & Pop restaurant to have a good breakfast in East Mesa then Cozy Corner Cafe is the place you want to try."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Good food and great service! This is a place they know your name . They have different specials everyday."}
{"text":"My dad had the corned beef hash and i got the country fried steak skillet. They are both delicious. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The Cozy Corner Cafe. We have been here once and we would never come back. The service was terrible, and our waitress acted like we didn't exist. She asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to eat and to give us the bill, all of the other times, she never asked how the food was or anything of the sort. Now the food. I ordered pancakes, eggs, and bacon. All of the food was cold when it got to our table. The pancakes weren't fluffy they were- just- not good. The eggs weren't good either, they weren't fresh and they were undercooked. Now the bacon. It wasn't crispy it was chewy and covered in fat. Overall the food and service were terrible for the time we spent looking for the place so I never come back nor would I recommend it a friend."}
{"text":"How great is Cozy Corner? Well, my wife and I regularly drive up from Gilbert to eat here, passing many other breakfast establishments along the way.
The food is always delicious and the service is unfailingly fast, friendly and reliable. The only downside is that it gets very crowded at times, especially during snowbird season.

Cozy Corner isn't fancy. The decor can best be described as quirky-campy. But you can't beat the food or the staff. Here's a special shout-out to Shelly, the waitress extraordinaire who always remembers our names and greets us with a smile and a hug. She's a treasure."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast joint in the east valley. Great service & great food! Always packed on Saturday & Sunday's so plan to wait a bit- always worth it!"}
{"text":"Hot and hungry after playing 9 holes of golf at Dreamland GC, we happened to be driving by a shopping center and figured we'd drop into the supermarket to get something to eat.  As we parked, we spotted the Cozy Corner Cafe, what a welcoming sight.  Walking in, we noticed most of the tables were occupied, always a good sign.  Soon we were seated and ordered breakfast.  I chose the bacon omelet with hash browns, my wife picked the vegetable omelet with hash browns.  Waitress was pleasant and friendly, service was very fast.  Our food was delicious.  My wife commented on the tasty vegetables which were chopped up along with avocado and cooked inside the omelet instead of being placed atop it.  My bacon was crisp, just the way I like it. The prices were amazing: our omelets were a mere $6.99 each! We will definitely return to Cozy Corner and highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Went there twice for breakfast while here on vacation. Food is excellent, great service and loved the coffee."}
{"text":"If you blink, you'll miss this place. Very friendly and fast service, food comes out hot and in a timely manner. Omelet's are divine and the french toast with hawaiian sweet bread is very yummy. Place has a cozy, quaint feelings to it. Very friendly staff and customers. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"This is such a sweet little place. It is so much better than the unfathomably popular Iowa Cafe. Cozy Corner is not fancy, but it's got a  fab tuna melt, nice breakfasts, and a friendly staff. Sometimes your server may get a little scarce, but once you catch her, she's great.

The only complaint I have is that I wish they had longer hours, but then that isn't really an insult, is it? :)"}
{"text":"Service was really good, no wait, the staff was very attentive.  Food came out fast and was decent, but nothing special.  Hashbrowns were simple, eggs were eggs, corned beef hash wasn't homemade.  My kids liked the pancakes."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast. The country fried steak skillet is so good. Fun atmosphere & great service."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the service is excellent and super friendly.  I would eat here just to talk to Shelly and Hayley who are lots of fun, and some of the best waitresses ever.  I particularly liked how they went out of their way to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times and every experience we've had here has been great! My four year old LOVES their French toast so much that she refuses to try anything else! Their pecan waffles and pancakes are fantastic and their eggs are always cooked perfectly. The waitresses already recognize us and are always friendly and welcoming. We've met the owner, as well, and he's just as nice, eager to get to know you and making sure that everything was tasty. This is hands down the best breakfast/lunch spot in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast spots in Mesa.  They have their signature twist on breakfast that makes a fairly unoriginal meal taste original. 

I have tried a few things here, so I want break down my meal.  I will say everything I've tried I would order again."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for about 3 years, and the food and service certainly falls into the 5 star category. I'm a  little amused by some of the critical comments offered by one or two others: e.g. Yes, there are ads laminated to the surface of the dining tables, but I don't consider this disrespect.  What I would consider disrespect (to the servers) is not leaving a gratuity!  Perhaps, you could stop by some day and make amends. Yes, some the servers wear shorts, but I haven't noticed any butts showing as of late...and if they happen to appear, perhaps you should look the other way. Yes, the clientele is somewhat in the senior age category, primarily due to regulars coming back time and time again; But. I can promise you if your under 50 or even a millennial, you'll be welcome with outstanding service and great food from dedicated people."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Cozy Corner on one of the few nights they were opened for dinner. It was Saturday night. Prime rib night. After trying another local home cooking restaurant in the area, we were cautious about this one. 
First, if you have vintage paintings, signs, and great ambiance, that automatically gives you an automatic two stars, because of great decorating taste. Of course, I started getting new ideas for my own house by visiting here.
I ordered the spaghetti. The sauce was meaty and delicious.  You wouldn't think something as simple as spaghetti would be a tell about a restaurant, but there is a difference between sauce and pasta that has flavor, as opposed to something  thrown together from a  jar. The spaghetti here was already a good sign.
 Then, there was the prime rib. My husband liked it. Enough that we are willing come back again, in the future. 
Sweet atmosphere, good food, cozy homecooked restaurant.   Skip the Village Inn that's in the same parking lot and visit the Cozy Corner Cafe, instead."}
{"text":"This place is very far from where I am, but I have been exploring the N.E. Mesa area lately. There are a lot of midwest themed restaurants here definitely catering to the retirees in the area. The place looks like it is about 50 years old when in reality it is only about a few years old, and I do not mean that as a compliment. So the atmosphere is nothing to rave home about.

Now onto the food, it was not that good. I tried the biscuit and gravy and eggs and hash brown. It was pretty average to below average in taste, preparation, and quality. I would understand if they were reasonably priced like the other midwest places, but they were actually the same in cost  as some higher end restaurants.  So I do not recommend the food and the prices of this food also.

I have to conclude that I was disappointed especially considering the gas money I spent to get to this place. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I would never go back here again. This place isn't just tiny and has midiocre foods. They didn't tell us in the begging that they have Only One table that have space for high chair or stroller and had us waited. Then they blamed on a new waitress who was actually nice trying to make a room for a high chair. Oh coffee tasted like sh**t. I don't know all these people drink coffee from where. This is probably ok for snowbirds but I'd go 10mins down south red mountain cafe for much better portions and nice people serving nice foods nice coffee"}
{"text":"Other than being snow-bird central, we love this place.  Great service, great breakfast food, and they always have the nicest things to say about our one year old!

Wait can be very long from November through April due to all of the geezers and fogeys (old people, snowbirds). However, its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, very clean, worth the 30 min wait. Spoke to the owner who was working the register. His pride and commitment to customers was evident. Offered a money back guarantee if customers aren't satisfied!  We will be back for the prime rib and Alaskan cod fish fry on Fridays"}
{"text":"I come during peak Sunday hours and there is usually a wait but it is very short, about 5 mins. Service is always on point and personal. Southwest breakfast burrito is my go-to. Simply a consistently great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Food was 'Okay' (Husband & I each had a salad & shared a cup of clam chowder , taste like canned soup)

I was a little thrown off by the \"Uniforms\" the wait staff wore... The Tshirts are fine but the Denim SHORT shorts?! YIKES!!
Completely inappropriate for a family cafe.

When it came time to pay the bill, waitress ignored us and started up a conversation with the person behind us in line.
As we were leaving I said \"Thanks have a good day\" & got no response back.

Can't see us every going back & can't recommend..."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to eat. Great food, service, and fair prices. I eat hear at least twice a week and the country fried steak and eggs is my favorite meal."}
{"text":"cute little place.  Good food.  Service wasn't fast, but they are friendly.  We defiantly be back.  Thanks to our friends Hank and Shanny who Yelped about this place, it's why we came."}
{"text":"I have seen this place several times when we were out in the area, but we never seemed to be out there during open hours. We FINALLY made it out there during serving hours, and we were NOT disappointed. I love to try spinach omelet, and this one was so flavorful and tasty. Even my husband commented on how good it was. He went with the blueberry pancakes, and said that they were very good. Even with his full stack, he commented that he didn't feel like a carb overload. Our mom got the corned beef hash, and she said that it was really good. We all agreed that this was a breakfast/lunch place to keep on our top tier list."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.   Bit of a wait, but not bad.  I was going to get biscuits and gravy, which my son got, and loved.   Waitress convinced be to get country skillet... not bad, but the potatoes were horrible.   They were sliced and looked like they were just warmed in the grill.   I was hoping for hash browns, or country fries.   Mentioned I did not like the potatoes and was told by the same waitress I should have ordered the old style or something like that and I would have been served country fries with peppers and onions.   I thought that was what I ordered in the first place. 

Did not like my meal.   I will think about tying them again because the staff was so friendly, and my son loved the biscuits and gravy.  Another miss, and I won't return"}
{"text":"We just moved from Scottsdale and were looking for the Mesa version of Randy's.  Cozy Corner Café has just made the list for sure.  The service is friendly, the food is down home and tasty, and the ambiance is pleasant.  The owner stood and visited with us for about 10 minutes while we were waiting for our food so I can't remember if it was slow or not.  (However, we figure if we are served sooner than that it just came out of the freezer to the micro.)  We love it and we are recommending it to our family too."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been to CCC three times, and each time it has been friendly, clean and efficient. The food is always of good quality and I've enjoyed each item we've had. I'm not a big breakfast guy, die to the fact I know I can make it at home far cheaper and just as good as most places, but will gladly patronize CCC on occasion! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"OMG.......this is the best breakfast in Mesa.  I was turned on to this restaurant last season and was excited to get back here to go to breakfast"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly people, has a small hometown feel. I had breakfast and the food was cooked perfectly for me. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We have been in Mesa for a few days and have visited Cosy Corner twice!  Breakfast was excellent, as was the service.  Highly recommend the eggs Benedict, delicious hollandaise sauce and the english muffin was grilled and crispy adding a nice consistency to the dish.  We will go back again!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever. The only problem is that there most likely be a wait and that is because the food is that good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service. The staff was very welcoming. It was quite busy for a weekday morning but we were seated quickly.

Would go again."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I was very disappointed. We were seated, served our drinks by someone other than our waitress and not acknowledged by her for ten minutes. She finally stopped by our table and said \"I'll be with you shortly\"... by then a couple was seated at the table next to us and their order was taken right away by a different waitress than ours. We finally had our order taken at which time the couple next to us got their food; 30 minutes later we received our food by who must have been the cook/dishwasher. No acknowledgement from our waitress and the couple next to us was getting up to pay their bill. Needless to say I will not return here. 
I am all about supporting small business, but this is one that needs some improvement on their customer service."}
{"text":"My son and I were in AZ for spring training and went looking for a breakfast spot before the A's home game at Hohokam Stadium.  Saw all the good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to pay a visit and we're so glad we did.  Tucked inside a strip mall, Cozy Corner Cafe may not look like much from the outside, but they're serving-up some delish food inside.  

They have a \"Specials\" board outside that you need to sneak a peak at before walking-in.  Once inside, the decor, vibe and hospitality set this place apart.  We were greeted warmly and there were already a good amount of people enjoying breakfast.  However, the young lady asked if we'd be OK sitting at an open table in the rear of the restaurant and got seated very quickly.  I really liked seeing all the local advertising on the tables.  I thought this was a nice touch and shows how connected the restaurant is to the local businesses.

The service here is impeccable.  Not only are the staff super friendly, but they make you feel right at home.  I was impressed with how the staff were all hustling and it didn't matter who your server was, since everyone was pitching-in throughout.  Not to mention doing so with smiles on their faces, that allowed you to sit back and enjoy your meal.  My son ordered the pancakes, eggs and sausages.  The pancakes were very light, fluffy and really good.  I ordered the 2-egg with French Toast Special.  Rather than get hash browns and toast, this came with an order of their Hawaiian sweet bread french toast.  The french toast was just right and this hit the spot perfectly.  

Prices are reasonable and you get your money's worth of food.  Our glasses of water never got below halfway, before someone came by to refill them.  Checked-in on Yelp and received a 10% discount as well.  All in all, an excellent way to start our way."}
{"text":"The BEST biscuits and gravy EVER! Chicken fried steak and fries and hash browns ALL totally DELICIOUS!
Staff is so friendly and courteous, too. :-D"}
{"text":"We live just around the corner from 'Cozy Corner' and we love it!  The service is great and the food is even better!  Took my friends there for breakfast and they loved it!  The food is very fresh, cooked perfectly and served quickly.  We haven't tried their lunch but we will soon.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait, seriously bring a lil snack just in case. They make great use of the space. The decor is homie/welcoming, and the staff are just the right amount of nice/friendly. The coffee is not as strong as i like but its not going to keep me. BEST bowl of grits I've had in a long time and i know some people will cringe when i say that i love the canned corned beef hash Yu-uhm!!!  Myself, husband and daughter have found our breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place has a great omelette (spinach & bacon) that I enjoy coming here for.  They also have good coffee and they give you the good creamer, you know the one with the vanilla in it.  The service is always great, the food is always hot and delicious.  I am a fan and will be going back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast joint in the area. Troyce is owner/Chef and cooks up some of the best hash browns, corned beef hash, homemade chorizo I have had. Waffles, French Toast and Pancakes are superb. Bacon is always crispy thick cut just like I want it. He made a fresh cup of Grits for me today and it was FABULOUS! Cooking grits is an art form and few cooks ever do it right. He put special love into it. This is my \"go to\" breakfast place in Mesa. If you stop in say HI to Amanda and Carly ( owners daughter) who serve with a smile and super friendly service is fast. Be advised the lines are long on weekends."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place ever!! The food is so presentable and delicious. Very family oriented and everyone there is sooo sweet!!"}
{"text":"First visit here 5/27/16. The restaurant was moderately busy and appeared very clean. The booth benches were worn.
Service was great, my food was decent. I ordered two eggs and kielbasa with toast and hash brown potatoes. I forgot to leave the tip, sorry. Never been here before, had to pay at the register at the front door which got me moving that way and I just left without leaving a tip for the waitress, sorry for that. It completely slipped my mind once I was heading for the door.

While my food and service was technically nearly perfect I did have one thing that sort of soured me on this place. This sort of thing may not bother you but it does bother me.

All the dining area table tops are covered with ads. There is a note in the corner showing that this is a service they get, table tops with ads.
I used to sell advertising for a living so I'm keenly aware what ads are worth and captive eyeballs too. Generally I avoid ads, I do not watch TV and seldom listen to the radio. Ads are becoming more and more intrusive and the ones online are increasingly rude. I use an ad blocker on my web browser, but having to sit and have a table top of ads staring at me while I wait for my food is what I would consider disrespectful.
To me, the decision to rent their table tops for ads means they do not respect me. I take it that they feel I am not a person but just an \"it\" to be advertised \"at.\" 
While the service and food was fine I draw the line at being treated with disrespect, so I won't be returning to dine here. 
If this sort of activity doesn't bother you, please assume I gave this restaurant 4 stars for decent food and service but they lose one for disrespecting the very people that keep them in business, give them all jobs."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast to kick off the weekend! Chorizo and eggs with home fries never fails. Coffee cup stays full and the staff is always friendly. I'm glad this little gem is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place in Mesa!  Friendly service, great food, cozy atmosphere and close to home!"}
{"text":"Found this through Yelp when looking for a \"non-chain diner\" for brunch. It's a small cafe tucked back in the strip mall behind several other restaurants and doesn't look looked much from the outside. Inside, it's filled with kitschy decor and welcoming, smiling staff. The servers are very attentive, greeting you quickly after you're seated, bringing refills and removing empty plates without being asked. You can tell that many customers are regulars and are greeted by name. The food is home cooked, the portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. We really enjoy the positive vibe and eat here whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"Tables are so high that i felt like i was shoveling food to my mouth.  Very disappointed in the menu, food quality, service and those darn tables are just too high!!  Ergonomically awful!!"}
{"text":"3rd visit to this restaurant,  kind of a MA & PA setup with lots of Artsy things on the walls to look at.  Service is really friendly an fast.  Today I had Egg Benedict  it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food with a great atmosphere! Went there and met the new owners and they were awesome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and like that the menu has lots of food options.  Staff is always friendly and you can tell they're like family (and in fact, some of them ARE family).  My favorite is the breakfast burrito.  Love, love, love.  This place is also popular with the older crowd, so be prepared for a wait if you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning in the winter."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast stop when visiting my parents each winter. Friendliest staff you'll encounter, big portions, great variety."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great staff.  Most restaurants  don't have the level of service  we received.   Too bad we are just traveling through  or this would be our  new breakfast  destination."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food is mediocre at best, but the great service that you get from a. Dry pleasant staff make things so much better. 
I would say 3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the great service. Combined, a solid 4. 
I will return next time I visit my sister in Mesa."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a suggestion from a family member.  The restaurant itself is very cozy and casual feeling, the perfect atmosphere for breakfast.  

The staff was very friendly and attentive.  

I had the country fried steak.  Very delicious with a good portion.  

Best thing was the prices for me. $7-8 for most of their stuff.... Very good deal!"}
{"text":"A little out dated but it's nice. Staff is lovely. The chorizo burrito is delicious!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast this morning with friends and the food wss excellent.   The staff and owner Troyce were very friendly.   This is a must go to place.  Mostly booths with a few tables so if you have a large group call ahead to get a table.  Pleade go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Let's talk breakfast, I had biscuits and gravy and my wife had two banana pancakes. 
The price was very fair and for the meal I felt is was very comparable. The surroundings are very eye catching. There are little things to look at everywhere and the pig does fly in this place. The staff is very nice and seems to know the menu. The biscuit was soft crumbly and very tasty by itself, the gravy was a sausage gravy and was really good. The wife and I wanted to try them on our own so as to give a fair review. Two thumbs up on both sides. So if ever in the area again we WILL be back to this spot. The price and food speak for itself."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had lunch, but the breakfast is great. It's like a little family here, there are a bunch of \"regulars,\" typically older people and the servers seem to know everyone by name."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.!

My boyfriend and I just moved here from Southern California, and before we moved, we had to make a few trips back and forth to look at houses, jobs etc.

We stumbled upon the cozy corner during one trip, and decided to try to because of the great Yelp reviews, and boy are the true.!

We walked into the door, and although the place was packed on this Sunday morning, we only waited about 5 minutes for a table, and had drinks on our table within another 5 minutes of sitting down.

My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak, with a side of chocolate chip waffles, and I got a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings (I don't like breakfast), and we didn't speak for the entire meal. It was that good, we didn't want to stop taking bites to talk to each other.

The restaurant is family owned and operated, and they make it known, but in a fun way. The dad (owner) and daughter (waitress) were making their rounds, joking around and having fun with each other. I love my dad, so this made me so happy.

Long story short, this place is amazing. The food is delicious, they make you feel so welcome, and everyone is so kind and in a great mood. We will be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Good place for biscuits and gravy. The portions are huge and taste great. Everything else is nice,  but I live for their biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"The place is close and a cozy diner atmosphere. The food was good, but not spectacular. They were a little pricey for what I ordered. 
Also they do not have any pancake and egg meals, you have to buy them separately? 
With no.wait time on a Sunday afternoon, it was good."}
{"text":"Just want to say what an awesome little gem cozy corner is. I have been coming to this place for over 10 years now and absolutely love the food and employees they all work together as a great team, not sure what \"Julie\" is talking about, maybe she got up on the wrong side of the bed!! Love this place and will continue to support them and refer this restaurant!! This place is always hopping and girls are always hustling."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe! Very whimsical decor. Server was friendly and attentive, food was good and coffee was great. Would love to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  They don't take reservations, but with a few days notice Cozy Corner was able to accommodate our party of 13 nicely. Every one was happy with their menu choices."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast. I had the steak and eggs steak wasn't seasoned at all. Food took a lil too long to be served but if you're in the area or a local it's ok to stop by and have a quick bite there"}
{"text":"This place just fell out of small town America and landed in Mesa. They know people's name!! It's like cheers, with less cheap beer and way better breakfast. I've only been a few times and I've always brought my 3 year old son. They treat him like a king and their kids menu is spot on. Biscuits and gravy are pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and friendly. The food was great! I would definitely recommend coming here for a lovely brunch."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mesa.  Best breakfast I've had while visiting here.  Been here twice and will be back again.  Great food, large portions.  Service is outstanding.  The owner is always on the floor ensuring all guests are getting the best possible food and service.  The biscuits and gravy are true to the south.  I would recommend a 1/2 order unless you are really hungry.  The portions are big."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! Seated right away and the food was hot and delicious! Our party of four were all happy with what we ordered. Perfect! Yummy! 
I asked Jolene our waitress for a little whipped cream on the side for my coffee and she didn't bat an eye at my unusual request! Thank you Jolene for your prompt,  courteous service. We will be visiting again here soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, friendly staff! Great service! Inside reminds me of an ole country store w/ all there decorations. Waiters are always near by for refills."}
{"text":"Can u tell I like this place they do a GREAT breakfast have excellent service ! My eggs always come out perfect poached medium and the food is always hot"}
{"text":"This is on of our favorite breakfast stops around the country.  The food is very good, the servers are super friendly and super attentive (it would be impossible to say enough good about them).  We have had several items from the breakfast menu and we were very pleased! And the coffee, it is wonderful.

This is our breakfast place when we are in Mesa."}
{"text":"Wonderfully clean breakfast spot. Described my meal as very fresh- which is not always the case. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast or lunch! They have huge portions for the price and so many options. My boyfriend said it's probably the best chicken fried steak we have found yet. Beware of the giant biscuits and gravy meal- a half order is enough. Decor makes you feel liek your at grandma's house and service is always superb!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a morning hike on a Saturday morning - was somewhat crowded, and was greeted quickly and cordially by the staff. As an observer, the staff was quick to clean off tables once vacant and quick to fill them in as well.

Environment: definitely comfortable - no frills and pretense - which is refreshing to me. The waitstaff is very helpful, cordial, and friendly.

Food: Just-right serving sizes, definitely pleased. I got the three meat omelette and was delighted with how much meat (bacon, sausage, ham) was actually in the omelette. Very tasty. My dad got pork chops and eggs - and the pork chop had a very good marinade and were cooked just right (to my liking).

All in all - I wish this place was closer to home - would definitely go again, and highly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant has service issues.  My fiancé and I decided to re-try this place for breakfast after our first visit together over a year ago. (The first time, service AND food were so bad we vowed never to return.) I used to come in every now and again a long time ago and enjoyed their grandma's homely atmosphere and classic cooking... But I'm so upset by my last two visits because I WANT to like this place. 

Here's what happened: my fiancé and I are in no rush, and wait close to 10 minutes at the front if the restaurant where a sign states \"please wait to be seated.\"  The waitress acknowledged us, but took care of a few tables delivering food and tabs before seating us. We observed a nearly full restaurant with 2 servers, 1 busser, no host... And who we assumed was the manager. We immediately assumed that they were understaffed. 
This is when it gets bad. We overhear a customer checking out ask if they were hiring, to which the server replied that they were not hiring and the manager just hired on several on call servers. Uh, where are they? Because now is the time to call them in, yo. 
We were \"seated\" by someone pointing at our table and walking away.  Unwelcoming and unprofessional. 
My fiancé ordered a breakfast burro and I ordered a half order of biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. Food was good, especially the burrito. That's where the compliments end... 
Both of us ordered coffee. Every time the other waitress came to our table to refill our cup, she did so so quickly and sloppily that my cup was wet, the table around it, and eventually the rest of the booth next to me too. The bus boy took more care than the female server pouring my coffee! Oh, and I know what you're thinking... How many cups of coffee was I served? Upwards of 5 or 6... Because after our food was gone and our plates picked up we sat at our table watching other families who sat down 20 minutes after us receive their checks. We were still served coffee?  We need our server and our check. My fiancé had to ask for our check to the wind behind the waitress passing us... TWICE for our tab. 
What did she do? She took care of the table behind us who arrived after us. We watched her, looked her dead in the eye, and then received our bill a few minutes later without eye contact or an apology.

My fiancé and I felt honestly prejudged for looking young enough to be teenagers. Do we deserve bad service because you expect us not to tip?  We were ignored or received less than mediocre service. Maybe they should consider retraining their servers. We left so mad, the food can't convince us to return for a 3rd try."}
{"text":"Had a dear friend introduce me to the Cozy Corner Cafe earlier this Summer as I somehow didn't have my phone with me, I couldn't snap a few pics on my initial visit.  I was blown away with how good the food was as well as the awesome staff.  I knew I'd have to bring my lady here to enjoy a weekend breakfast. So, this past Saturday, we stopped in and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.

My lady ordered eggs benedict with a side of fresh fruit. I went a little bit off the menu and asked for a rare hamburger steak to go with my eggs and hashbrowns. I've posted a few pics of our visit.  Our breakfasts were delicious and as usual, the staff (Jessica looked after us.  Awesome job Jessica!) were awesome not only in their service but with their great humor!  Really started our day off on the right foot.

Special shout out to Jessica, Annette and Carli!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe with awesome food. Had a bacon cheeseburger with green chilies, yum! The lady had chicken fried steak with home fries, amazing! Minions ate chocolate chip pancakes and French toast, ! Wonderful and friendly staff. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews, we decided to try this place out. We went on a Sunday morning and I was surprised at how quickly we got sat (there were multiple people waiting outside in front of us but we still only had to wait ~10 mins). Service and food was very fast. I had a mini veggie omelette and hash browns which were amazing. The coffee was also excellent. My husband got the corned beef hash. He said it was average but could tell it was canned and not homemade. All in all it was a good place, but we are still in search of some good homemade corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"Great family owned place for breakfast and lunch. We come here all the time. Great people, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great place and very reasonable....old school diner with good food and friendly service-
Shoutout to Jessica for her friendly service"}
{"text":"3.5? I feel thats a much more accurate description for this place. 

I ordered the eggs benedicts with hash browns. I also had some of my friend's biscuits and gravy. The eggs benedict was bare minimum when it came to ingredients. Ham, egg, english muffin, and hollandaise sauce. The size of them were a little smaller than I expected, but at least it had some flavor. Nothing exotic or unique, but at least it got the job done. I could taste the ham, the egg was poached the way I like, and the muffin was sturdy but moist. Even the hollandaise sauce didnt taste like a pool of butter. The hashbrowns were pretty generic. I ate them and was not impressed. They were moist, slightly crispy, and thats about it. I had to use plenty of tabasco to taste anything. The biscuits and gravy barely had any flavor (and Im pretty sure there were sausage chunks). The biscuits were soft, but also pretty mushy. The gravy had no character. Their fried egg sandwich looks good though, and so do their burritos. 

This place flavor wise does better than a straight up 3 star diner, but they have some work to do. I imagine all the old people and families love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff, service with a smile is key with me and those folks were always smiling. Wife ordered a the eggs benni and I got the 2 eggs meal. Potatoes are the best! Go there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. Service staff was really friendly. Visiting my grandparents from out of town and glad to see Amanda knew them by name an treated them so sweetly. Thanks for taking care of my family Cozy Corner"}
{"text":"It does have a cozy type of atmosphere, but it's not small. I ordered the mini spinach, bacon and mushroom omelette, and It was enough for me. I bypassed the toast and potatoes for a healthy portion of diced fresh fruit. The omelette was tasty, the coffee good and the service great. $12."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here a lot. It's really cute & everyone is super friendly!! It's always pretty busy but the wait is never too long except for on Sundays!! The food is good but it's not to die for. My boyfriend really loves their BLTA. Yummy country gravy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere.
The Swedish pancakes are good.
They have a lot of repeat business.
They sing happy birthday.
Come over and check it out.
Have a good day."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend and now that I've had the food there I will definitely be a regular. Can't wait for out of town family to visit so I can take them here. Luay the owner make me feel very welcomed and is a character  make sure to ask for him, he will for sure make your day."}
{"text":"This is One of my favorite morning breakfast places they have an excellent eggs Benedict I switch out the ham for bacon they make homemade hollandaise sauce the owner and the staff are all wonderful this restaurant gets very busy in the fall winter and early spring and the summer normally you can get in without a problem I like to get there before 8 o'clock on a Sunday I would highly recommend this restaurant every dish we've had so far has been delicious"}
{"text":"There was a noticeable wait when we got there.  We were told it would be about 30mins., but it only felt like 15mins.  Once inside, it is on the smaller side, but does in fact feel \"cozy.\"  The staff was very friendly and there was always someone constantly walking around refilling coffee.  As for the food, they give you very good portions and everything tasted good.  I would recommend the biscuits and gravy, great portions and great gravy.  Fantastic place to stop in for breakfast.  There's a Village Inn nearby, do yourself a favor and come here instead."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my buddy because I found it on yelp. I expected it to be good but not anywhere near as good as it was. We had the half biscuits and gravy with eggs and sausage. Some of the  best biscuits and gravy that I've ever had. The waitress Allison, treated us like we were long lost buddy's. I can't say enough good things about this place I will be a loyal customer for as Long as I can see in the future."}
{"text":"Old people central! My boyfriend found this place on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. The service wasn't bad. A lot of the people eating there were clearly regulars.

The whole ambiance was clearly catering to the elderly. Which is fine! But as a couple in our early twenties, we felt a little out of place. My boyfriend got steak and eggs and he was not too wowed by them, but seemed to think they were fine. One thing I liked was that they had an option for a mini omelette. Perfect for if you are not totally starving. It was not too bad.

I felt too young for this place, but it was a nice little restaurant, I liked seeing the staff interact with the regulars. Also liked the little candies they had out to take before you leave. Exciting when it is something other than a mint haha."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for breakfast, service and food are impeccable and always there. Like the decor of the place.

Chicken fried steak is always good and hot, gravy is chunky and very well-made! This is our go-to spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Had the Sausage Quasadilla (sp?) it was very delicious. Don't let my spelling discourage you from trying it."}
{"text":"Cozy indeed--friendly service and a good hot breakfast on sat am. I had pancakes and eggs and my husband enjoyed his hashbrowns. Omelette had lots of meat, which he loved! Good vibe here for sure."}
{"text":"I had a lot of trouble deciding what to order off of the perfect diner menu at Cozy Corner, but finally settled on the Eggs Benedict. Then the helpful server asked: How would you like your eggs? Soft, medium, or hard cooked? I went middle-of-the-road and ordered medium. Five minutes later two PERFECTLY cooked eggs arrived on top of smoky Canadian bacon, with goey centers that drizzled out in a photo-worthy way when I pierced them with my fork. And the home fries were sizzling crisp on the side. An awesome meal. My only complaint: the restaurant doesn't seem to be on the corner of anything. Cozy, yes indeed; corner, no. But who cares when they deal amazing meals from their straight-arrow location?"}
{"text":"We have found this to be our favorite breakfast place in Mesa. The meals are delicious and the portions are just right!"}
{"text":"Finding a good place for a simple breakfast isn't always easy.  The Cozy Corner does fit the bill though.  It is actually in a convenient location but still hard to miss if you are not looking for it.  The decor is simple and the seating takes advantage of their space so they can efficiently take care of their guests.  The breakfast menu has everything you would expect from a neighborhood cafe.  Pricing is reasonable and the portions will not leave you hungry, but also will not cause you to hire a moving truck to take home the left overs which I think is wasteful at other places.  Will need to come back to check out their lunch selections one day."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The customer service is outstanding. They all amaze me, as they are always moving and never empty handed. They don't care if you are seated in their area or not, they will assist you. The food is just good old home cooking and the portions just the right size.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place!  The staff is fast and friendly and the food is always great.  The kitchen is accommodating to special request regarding your meal and still manages to deliver things fast and hot.  We have never had a bad experience.  Some of the best Eggs Benedict around!  Be sure to read all the fun signs while waiting for your food!"}
{"text":"First time here, won't be the last!  Had the country fried steak breakfast.   Eggs were perfect,  meat tender, hash browns crispy, gravy delicious!   Not sure why this place isn't a 5 star from everyone.  The French dips at the next table looked delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM! It's loaded with Old Phoenix memorabilia and has excellent service. The food taste great and the prices aren't bad either. The Cozy Corner Cafe brought you right to grandmas kitchen and there was plenty of props to look at. A little heavy on the advertising of local businesses but hats off for them helpping the community."}
{"text":"Standard good breakfast joint. I cleaned my plate. It was like country scramble or something with everything in it. So good. I will definately return and so will my family when they visit"}
{"text":"This place is a great find. Packed restaurant and was only 15 min wait. Food came out in 15 and was great. Biscuit was soft, gravy was perfect and portions were big and bill was more then reasonable. Would come back if ever in the area again"}
{"text":"Service was friendly but, we were disappointed with the food- the supreme southwest burrito was big for sure but not much flavor in the salsa and the burrito itself had too much potatoes, some eggs, and very little sausage. My corned beef hash seemed to have come out of a can.  Coffee was weak, just a little better than hot water. Too bad! We drove a few miles out of our way to eat here because of the reviews and it didn't live up to them."}
{"text":"Still one my favorite breakfast places in the east valley. Finally got some friends to stop settling for the chain breakfast places & try Cozy Corner. Needless to say, no more chain places for them. I go here about 4x month with friends and/or clients. Great service, consistently good, simple breakfast at a very good price. Biscuits & gravy are comfort food done right - fluffy biscuit & creamy sausage gravy. Pecan waffle is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Just a great home style, comfort food cafe with great service. We have made this a stop when we are in Phoenix visiting family and friends. I can't talk about the lunch menu, but if it's anything like the breakfast, it is great as well. Besides the typical breakfast menu, they usually have some sort of special. This isn't an over the top experience, but if you are looking for a great place with great food and staff, plus a little memory of home town diners...this is it."}
{"text":"The place was cute and clean. The crowd was elderly. The service was prompt but surly. The fish fry wasn't great. (We are from WI and have yet to find a good fish fry around here.) We may go back to try their breakfast which looked pretty good, but not again for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, The food is amazing, My favorite is the pork- tenderlion sandwich and of course the onion rings, also the burger is awesome, The  staff, Jessica, Annette, Renee, Allison,Shelly, Amanda, all of the staff is just awesome  Great Food , Go get you sum !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cozy Corner Cafe is a solid place for breakfast. My family and I went here and had a really enjoyable experience. We went on a Saturday morning and had about a 25 minute wait. Not too bad for prime time breakfast. 

I ordered the veggie omelette. They have several omelette options for us vegetarians which is awesome. My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy and enjoyed them. The food was your fairly average breakfast diner food, not terrible at all (in fact pretty good) but not amazing. The service was prompt and friendly. Prices weren't too bad (I didn't pay so not sure what the total bill looked like)."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious. Whether it is an omelette or eggs Benedict, you'll leave beyond satisfied. Phenomenal customer service from all the servers. You must try this neighborhood cafe it is definitely cozy."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant! We're from out of town and didn't know what to expect, but the food was great and the service was amazing. All ten of us were thrilled with our food. I ordered the spinach omelette and scarfed the whole thing. They also give a generous portion of fruit and have a huge toast selection. The staff graciously topped the coffees and asked how we wanted our checks to be split. Couldn't have had better service!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot.  The service was prompt and food was very good.  The French Toast was a particular favorite with the kids."}
{"text":"This cafe is a local gem. We stopped on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The line was out the door, we put our name on the list, and the line moved along quickly. I say we waited 10 minutes at the most. The decor is old fashioned, but gives the cafe a homey feel.
We were seated and our waitress was by our table to get our drink orders right away.
I ordered the classic breakfast. 2 eggs, hash browns and toast. There was a choice of home fries or hash browns.
Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering how busy it was. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns were crispy. Yum! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. This will be a breakfast stop for is again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years.  Their eggs over easy come out perfect every time.  Staff is efficient and always friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day because Waffle House was too crowded. It was about a 15 minute wait and my party if three was seated. The ambiance was quite bizarre, but I expected nothing less from a Midwest themed restaurant. The waiter was nice and got our order quickly. The drinks were the first downside. I got orange juice (small) which was a cup about 5in tall with some generic orange juice, there was no refill and it cost $2. My dad's coffee was also not complimentary. We ordered the three meat omelette, pecan pancakes, and I had a country skillet. The omelette was good but not really big even though my dad ordered the full size and he ended up eating part of my food. My moms pecan pancake was mediocre. The reason why I am giving this 3 stars however is because my country skillet was really good. The potatoes and country fries steak were cooked perfectly. However, the biscuits and gravy, while being a nice addition to my meal, wouldn't be as tasty alone. It was very filling and worth the price ($10ish). Overall, service was lousy and we had constantly empty cups. It also costed pretty high. I mean, $30 for mediocre food? The talking stick resort breakfast charges that much for breakfast and they have free drinks, and salmon for breakfast! (Sorry, going on a tangent). We may return because we like small local business', but I think we will order smarter. I definitely recommend the country skillet, and next time I would probably get the country fried steak."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place open early 6am for us Early risers. Service is fantastic, food is very good and their menu is full of appetizing options."}
{"text":"Cozy Corner has great food, but what I really like is the pie they serve.  They purchase their pies from Piefection and they are the best pies I have ever tasted.  Cozy Corner carries different varieties from Piefection, but I especially love it when they have their coconut cream pie.  It is honestly the best pie I have ever tasted.  You should try the food at Cozy Corner, but DO NOT forget the pie!"}
{"text":"My family and I are Visiting from California loved the breakfast here, their service and prices are great, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"This has been a staple for me ever since I started coming to Mesa to spend time with my then girlfriend (now wife). Good old american food, mostly come here for breakfast, very reasonable prices, food is consistent, always busy. The eggs Benedict and french toast are on point.

Be prepared to wait a bit if you come by on a weekend morning, especially during snowbird season."}
{"text":"First time here I really enjoyed the old timey charm of this place.  Food was good, service was great, not too busy, but I can imagine it gets fairly crowded in the winter time especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Walked into a great atmosphere. All the staff was very friendly. The food was AMAZING!! Good portion size. We will definitely be making this a regular spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"Good food, nice diner feel here and comfortable seating area.  Prices are great but only one concern: Kitchen Staff arguing in the background heard throughout seating area. Better cool that pot or that anger might seep over into that great food.  good Stuff!!  But some needed Anger management"}
{"text":"The Corner Cafe is located between Kohl's and Fry's. It's good, down-home cooking.  Food tastes like Momma made, comfort food!"}
{"text":"Consistently great breakfast each time we've eaten here.  My parents went based on our recommendation and they regularly eat here when in town."}
{"text":"Service is very fast and friendly. Price is on the average slightly high side but at least here you get what you pay for. Very yummy food."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices. We visited when my parents were in town and they loved it. A good alternative to the typical chain breakfast restaurants. The server was really attentive to our large party with 5  kids. Only drawback, Cozy Corner is so good that it's really popular! Big parties will have to wait a little longer, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I went because of all the positive reviews.   We got there and the place was full on a Tuesday morning, a good sign. We were seated right away and we brought our drinks. We ordered. As we watched several other people come in and be seated and get their food, we kept waiting. And waiting. 50 minutes we waited as everyone around ate and left. We were about to leave and the waitress said it will be out in a minute. Another 10 minutes went by and then the food came.  Worst service ever. No apologies either. Not wasting my time on this place again."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Food is average. No fruit or garnishes just plain eggs, bacon & toast. Service good.  Place needs a good cleaning especially the doors, handles and tons of artificial plants and flowers."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast mid-week.  They were not especially busy that morning.
The service was a bit slow, the food average, and the prices above average.  Overall it was ok, but not as good as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Enjoyed this awesome breakfast spot.  It looks small but actually has a good amount of seating and they move the wait rather quickly.  It's worth the wait.  I ordered the French toast:  great taste and not soggy, really enjoyed it.  I also had chicken fried steak with two over medium eggs, smothered with country gravy all over a biscuit and potatoes.  Super delicious.  Biscuit was so good.  Eggs perfectly cooked and gravy had tons of flavor.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great find. Friendly locals and great service. Gravy for biscuits on home fries is the best. Weekday visit not too busy, but when snowbirds are back watch out. Lovely place."}
{"text":"Not a fan. My wife had been here before and liked the food. She had talked to the owner who told her everything was made from scratch. Not so. When we went there was black pepper in almost everything (she is allergic to this) and no way to get dishes without it. The salad dressing was commercial. I had a carne asada burrito, meat was good and plentiful, but was pot roast."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had their biscuits and gravy and it was simply...amazing. It reminded me of my fathers biscuits and gravy. 
My boyfriend ordered the burro with chorizo and that was super tasty too. We go there just in time and the staff was courteous and on top of it. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Waitress was really nice and helpful. The whole staff seemed to be really friendly and in good spirits. Food was really good and they have a great selection. Prices were higher n line with the chain restaurants so skip the chains and eat local!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Hands down the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had in the state of Arizona. Cue little place and great food. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We are regulars. Love the place. Staff is friendly and attentive. Food is always on point. I would recommend you visit."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! Love the Swedish pancakes 
The service is outstanding, I wish they had more coffee selection ."}
{"text":"Always great food. Quick even when busy. I've been getting the country skillet. A lot of people order the omelettes."}
{"text":"Just as all of the previous comments described, this is a great find, nestled into a nook in a busy shopping center. The line out the door to the tiny restaurant can be daunting but it moves quickly. We sat on the waiting bench out front for just a few moments before the friendly waitress sat us inside and I promptly received my morning coffee. It was Sunday morning, around 10:30 am, and I bet at this time when the weather cools, and the winter visitor's return, the wait will be longer!

I ordered the half order of biscuits and gravy with an egg and hash browns, and they were everything I could have wanted them to be. The waitresses were so on the coffee refills, I almost had to cover my cup and move it to the wall side of the table so I wasn't slipped a refill when I wasn't paying attention. I definitely never drank the whole cup. Everyone from the waitresses to the person at the cash register were extremely friendly and many regulars were greeted personally by the staff. 

I definitely recommend this spot, although if you need an intimate setting, the booths are pretty close together, and the tables are wide, so it can be hard to hear the person across your table over the chatter of the people in the next booth."}
{"text":"Nothing gourmet here , just classic breakfast & lunch fare, but prices are reasonable , service is friendly and food is much better than you will get next door at Village Inn, well worth a try"}
{"text":"Found this place at a strip mall in Mesa on Sunday. Definitely cozy. There was a wait but honestly, well worth it. I had the chicken fried steak as it was a recommended favorite and we ordered a full order of biscuits and gravy and a Denver omelet. The omelet was fine, nothing special but the chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy and coffee were exceptional. Service could have been a little better. I will most likely go again."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The food has been outstanding both times.  Our server the first time was great. The second time was ok, but she didn't let us know we had to request onions and peppers in out home fries and it was a little hard to get her attention so that was a little frustrating. She just wasn't as kind as the first, but to be fair, they were also much busier on the second visit. The important thing was, they have the best chicken fried steak I've ever had. Home fries were great too but be sure to request the onions and peppers if you want them.  Great overall."}
{"text":"Typical mom and pops type breakfast fare. I cant say that my experience was bad, but it wasn't the best. The food was mildly mediocre at best, however the breakfast burrito that my wife ate looked damn good. Maybe on a whim I'll return, but am not making it a must to venue."}
{"text":"Great food and a very unique dining room with interesting antique items and cute signs scattered about even if it is a bit cramped. Our waitress was really nice and attentive but not so much the cashier who didn't acknowledge me for several minutes while she yacked with a customer at a nearby table while I stood there waiting. Also, when she finally got around to me, she didn't exchange any pleasantries and acted cold towards me even though I had never been there before (was visiting family from out of town). This really took away from the experience and ruined an otherwise great visit."}
{"text":"Great little cafe. And when I use the word little I mean it. Still the food is always worth the wait. Great breakfast every time we come here. And the staff makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place and have been coming here for several years. It's one if the best places in the neighborhood. The staff is always friendly, knows us by name and gets us in quickly. The food is awesome! We just couldn't ask for a better breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast and lunch. ( closes at 2). Staff Very friendly and prompt. Have always had a great meal! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been too!  totally recommend this place! They have the perfect size meals, my favorite is the 1-1-1. It's one pancake, one piece of bacon & one egg, totally filling!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was not. The lady who brought out our food was awesome, but all the other staff we encountered from the host, to the waitresses, cashier...unfriendly. As other reviewers said, this place is packed with regulars. My sister and I came on a busy Sunday morning after finding Cozy Corner on Yelp, and even after informing the host that we had never been there before, she just shrugged us off and gave us a menu. Talk about first impression. The two waitresses who took our orders seemed equally annoyed when we asked questions about the menu. I really wanted to like this place since it's so close and the food was fine, but the service was such a bummer that we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times for lunch with family. The food I have had has been pretty good (always breakfast items). Other family has had lunch items and liked them. Would have given more stars, but they do not have desert. How does a place not serve desert??? We were told that they only have it on Friday nights. Most likely won't be back as my typical lunch group and I have a sweet tooth, and lets be honest, desert is the best part of any meal."}
{"text":"BAIT AND SWITCH!  Purchased a discounted coupon and they refused to accept it so we left and never to return.  Bad business to sell coupons and then refuse to take them and give you the excuse that they can't make any money if they did.  The right thing to do would be honor the coupon that are already sold and stop selling more. DUH!! Ducking Idiot!

If we would not have put the coupon out before we ordered then we would not have known until after the fact.  Not my problem that this business went into contract to sell coupons and they just decide that their  business is going so good or bad (who knows?) that they don't need to honor them anymore. 

 I don't think so!  I have been a customer for many years and will never return."}
{"text":"The coffee here is on point so good!! Servers are fast and on top of it. Food was just amazing! For sure you have to try the French toast. My cousin was having his birthday breakfast there and they brought out a hot cinnamon roll with a candle and invited the whole place to sing to him!! Just a great family experience, go try it!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff....fresh chow. ..fast staff..great for breakfast.  Biskets and gravy homemade....sausage gravy....yum"}
{"text":"Very busy for a Thursday morning.  Service was quite slow.  Food was average.  Not a lot of choices.  I had the breakfast burrito supreme - 2 stars.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Very good skillets. The service was also great. But could have used an area to wait while we were waiting to be seated. A small but comfortable breakfast place."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the Cozy Corner Cafe for the first time on Saturday and it was so busy! When we got there, we were about 6th in line to be seated. It took less than 3 minutes! Super impressive. The service was wonderful. 

We ordered quickly and the food came out super hot which was great. The food was delicious and kept me full the rest of the day. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch.  It is a pleasant atmosphere.  We had a very lackluster waiter that gave my wife the wrong order and was not eager to correct it.  The prices seemed high for average, mediocre food.  Maybe the breakfast is better."}
{"text":"Was out and about and checked handy dandy yelp and found this place. There was about a 15 min wait but on a Saturday morning, can't say it wasn't expected. The inside is cute and small. But definitely a great use of space. A normal setting would have two rows of booths on both sides but this place also had a row down the middle. 
Service was great. Everyone was friendly and things moved like a well oiled machine. Food was great! 
My mom had the eggs Benedict. I was impressed they actually toasted the English muffin well! Hash browns were perfectly crisp. 
Husband had the mini French toast and country skillet. I normally don't care for French toast because too many places make it soggy with too much batter but this one was dry and had a bite to it still. Yum! 
Then I had the silver dollar pancakes with eggs sausage. Again. Perfectly cooked. 
Very impressed. Definitely will be back. Even if it's a bit of a drive for us"}
{"text":"This has been hands down the best lil breakfast cafe in East Mesa. Environment, food and service deserve well above 5 stars. We've definitely found our Sunday spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my stop by the Cozy Corner Cafe. I had passed it many times while shopping at Kohl's and swore to stop by. This morning I did! And I am glad I did! I had prompt service by friendly waitresses, fresh hot coffee with swift refills, and a lovely chorizo burrito smothered in salsa.  It was tasty. The chorizo was crispy and spicy. Personally, I love chorizo burritos and this is probably one of the best I have had!

Overall, it's a simple diner. The food isn't fancy, but it is good. They had a large breakfast menu. I will be back to try more! Only one warning, there are only two larger tables for large parties (more than 4) so it is not the best if you have a big group."}
{"text":"The cozy corner is everything you want and need for a local breakfast joint.  

I stopped in the other morning when I was on this side of town.

I used to live in the area years ago, and it's like nothing has changed.  Great food, friendly service and low prices.  

$8.99 Country Fried Steak and Eggs with hash browns and toast, what an awesome meal for less than $10!

My pops enjoyed his bacon and eggs, which was $8.49 but included (4) strips of perfectly cooked bacon!

Bottom Line, if your looking for a good meal at a great price, this is the spot for you!!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Friendly atmosphere. The service is on point and the food is delicious.  Very reasonable prices and would definitely recommend if you are in the area.  Make sure you go early, they close at two."}
{"text":"After leaving the Iowa cafe we came over to the cozy corner cafe.  We were seated immediately and our drink orders taken.  We both ordered omelets which were served promptly.   Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The food was good and the service was excellent. We will definitely become regulars here. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant, little being the operative word here. We arrived to a line of people out the door. Obviously a local favorite on a Sunday morning. The lady ahead of me said they have been coming here every Sunday morning for years. This place really knows how to deal with a breakfast crowd on a busy day. As soon as the line went out the door, they set up chairs outside to sit on. This was short lived as the rush of people were soon seated. These people staff according to peak business times. We were seated in about 6 minutes. 

Our waitress was Mandy. She was right there to greet us with menus and to take our drink order. I ordered the breakfast burrito. While waiting for the order, I took time to admire all the antique country items that adorned the walls. Given the amount of people at the time, our orders were up reasonably quick. We were eating within 25 minutes of being seated. My burrito was one of the best breakfast burrito's I've had. It was made with fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, and topped with cheese and salsa. It was very filling. The price is reasonable.

One thing to keep in mind. If you show up in a group, wait until everyone is present to be seated. They don't hold tables for a party."}
{"text":"Cozy Corner Cafe didn't disappoint.  Upon arrival we were intimidated by the wait crowd outside, but put our name in anyways as we weren't in a hurry.  We seated quickly and waited on promptly.  I had the Breakfast Burrito.  The salsa covering the burrito was delicious!  My girlfriend had the French Toast and said it was ok.  They give you a free drink and a 10% discount for checking in on Yelp, so don't forget to do so!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Highly recommended. I'm new to the area and am trying out different places. I really like the French vanilla coffee creamers."}
{"text":"I've only been for breakfast.  Great food, good service and relaxing atmosphere."}

{"text":"If you're looking for a very casual breakfast in a cozy diner type atmosphere, then this place will work well.  The staff is friendly,  and as I said, it's very casual.  The walls are littered with little knick knacks.  

The food, is your run-of-the-mill diner food.  I went in for a breakfast, i.e. eggs, bacon, potatoes, and pancakes.  That's precisely what I received, no more no less.  It didn't knock me back by any means, but it wasn't bad.  The pancakes were made from a premix, but other than that the food was acceptable and appreciated.  

Not a place I'd go out of my way to visit, but in the area and hungry, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"This is a place you would take Grandma that requires bland imitation homestyle cooking. Nothing wrong with homestyle if done well! They also try to be too much with below average Mexican dish, like a carne asada burritos.. really? And for the 8$ they charge you would be thinking it was as good, if not better than Filbertos, but sadly, no it is not. This place if over priced for microwaved mediocre food that wants to be cracker barrel but falls short at every turn. Service is hit or miss. My son had ordered a burrito that was as big as the plate and enjoyed it, he does not have a refined palate, anyhow, he conned me into going a 2nd time and order the same breakfast burritos, it was literally 1/4 of the size as the week before. Worse yet there table next to us ordered the same and they were regulars and guess what the burritos were humongous. So I asked the waitress if they accidentally sent my son the child size and showed her the extreme differences in sizes, she gave a weak excuse and told my son to order something else. No problem, but that same waitress 2 min. Later came and sat at the table next to us with the burrito and starting eating it. She then proceeded to call over her co-workers asking them to help her eat the huge burrito. I am not joking!  The worse part is she was not in a break she has at least 5 tables including ours and really thought she was putting me in my place. Needless to say that hole in the wall will never get a cent from me again. Furthermore, I paid for the burrito she ate!! Ha ha."}
{"text":"A terrific breakfast-lunch restaurant with excellent food, service, and hospitality. It is no wonder there is always a line out the door when we go.  Give them a try, you won't regret it one bit."}
{"text":"This was a very good breakfast place. I went on a sunday morning for breakfast/brunch and it was quite delectable. We spoke with the owner and he was incredibly nice and told us all about the business and we seemed to become friends even though it was the first time we had ever met. Very personable personality, helps to have somone like that behind the drivers seat of a business like that. The food itself was good, and they had ood juices as well. The southwestern breakfast burrito is what I ordered and it was scrumptuous, and I also had a side of corned beef hash, and a bowl of fresh fruit. The fruit was good (although it clearly had preservatives), the burrito was also very tasty. The corned beef hash was not my favorite but one of my friends liked it so they had that. Overall quality breakfast/brunch experience. Very good food, quality service, and a very friendly staff! I do recommend this if you are in search of some good breakfast foods!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local breakfast spot! If you are looking for a fancy meal and mimosas to impress your Scottsdale friends, DON'T come here. However, if you are looking to have a nice simple breakfast with the BEST staff, this is the place. You will notice a lot of customers are on a first name basis with the waitresses and frequently engaging in conversations. The owner is always around mingling with customers, and everyone is genuinely in a positive mood.To sum up the review if you want to have a regular place where you will be remembered go to the Cozy Corner."}
