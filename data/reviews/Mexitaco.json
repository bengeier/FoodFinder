{"text":"It's not the fanciest place, and the neon lights can't be flattering, but this place has delivered EVERY time I go.  Authentic, flavourful Mexican food that is difficult to find, unless you are near a bus station in Mexico.  I find it much better than the tacos at Asador down the street (which in all fairness is Salvadorean, so you should really just stick with the pupusas...). I always get the Mexitaco platter, last time I came here with my sister it was gone in about 8 minutes.  It's that TASTY."}
{"text":"There is quite a bit of Mexican in this area, but I don't think this is the best one. Service is extremely slow and the food is pricy for what it is.   Patio in the summer is great though."}
{"text":"Bland, boring skimpy portions and misleading.   Go to Tacos El Asador for good portions, flavours that are more Mexican and prices that match what you paid for.  Mexitaco is a rip off joint."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is fun and casual, and the proprietors are really nice.   My wife and I went for lunch. We weren't super hungry so we split the tacos de carnitas. You get four small tacos, each with cilantro, onion, and their spiced pork. It was incredibly delicious. I think everybody gets their signature salsa rack, which has a red and a green salsa, and spiced onion. We got the guacamole too. Not the best, but competent. The tortilla chips are homemade and very good. I also had a Mexican tamarind soda.   We liked the place so much we went back that evening. I got the tacos again, and my wife got a beef fajita plate. They were terrific. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Service was terrible - we were there for 25 minutes before we even had drinks. There were 3 other tables. Food (quesadillas and burrito) was bland and flavourless; never going back. I have no idea why people review this place with high ratings."}
{"text":"\"Autentica Comida Mexicana\"...\"Tacos y Antojitos\"...the sign does not lie...and that the place even mentions \"Antojitos\" is a pretty good indication that this is Mexican \"Mexican\" food, real and unpretentious, and not the masquerading crap you find throughout most of North America.  The taco meat is nicely textured and flavoured (and there are real Mexican meat choices, like pastor...and carnitas on the weekends), the salsas are fresh and made from things over than canned tomatoes , and the chips are homemade . The people running the place appear to actually be from Mexico...and all the conversations at the tables around me were in Spanish. This is a Mexican restaurant.  I've never really understood why so many \"Mexican\" places fail at making anything resembling Mexican food...it really doesn't seem that hard..and yet they fail. This place does not...what a wonderful discovery."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Food is always fresh. The staff is so friendly and efficient. I feel like I'm in Mexico when I come here. Definitely worth the drive from Mississauga to here."}
{"text":"I was pleased to see Mexitaco set up shop at the corner of st-clair and Vic park. They even have a small patio set up for some sunny weather meals.      Unfortunately, the food is not living up to my expectations. I have tried the food twice just to be sure I was getting a fair taste of the menu. The burrito was good enough, nothing really makes me want to have another, it was simply ok. Today I tried the fish tacos which was simply presented with onion, chopped tomatoes and a fresh tasting taco. The fish was fresh and tender. You get 2 small tacos for 5.95. Well done.      I also ordered the pork taco which was similar yet inferior to the fish taco for 3 reasons: the meat was tough and overcooked, it was underseasoned and worst of all... the cilantro had not been properly cleaned leaving gritty dirt in each  taco bite. Very unappetising! Unforgivable.     Overall, Mexitaco can deliver a decent meal if your expextations are moderate, but nothing here says \" damn that's good!\"  If Mexitaco wants to succeed at this location they are going to have to up their game, pack some REAL flavor into their meals and most of all...clean the cilantro!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, but strictly Ok. I hate it when restaurants tone down the spice level for Canadians. Let spicy food be spicy!!"}
{"text":"Limited parking space since they're just right on the street.But McDonald's is right across. Service was very good. Food was great. Chicken Nachos,baja fish and shrimp tacos and churros was top notch. The carne asada wasnt much. Overall, food and service was awesome. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!  My favourites were the Baja fish tacos, tinga tacos and churros which are made fresh!  The shrimp ceviche tostadas were good. Guacamole satisfied my craving.   Yummy jurrito pineapple pop."}
{"text":"Been here once with family - great service, delicious fish tacos and guacamole (we've been to Mexico a few times so know a good taco!), good location and reasonably priced. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. Food is fantastic and people are wonderful and courteous. Atmosphere is happy and light."}
{"text":"Ordered:  Flautas Al Pastor Tacos Cochinita Pipil Tacos Tortillas Pico de Gallo  Tall can of Tecate and a Coke   First, we went on May 5th - likely one of their busiest nights of the year, and there were only two floundering waitresses attempting to cater to a full house and a half-full patio with food and drinks.  It was obvious that the large tables were eating, drinking, and talking - Help a table that has nothing on it, and at least get us our drinks.   30 minutes of waiting for the first girl to come get our drinks, and even then, I had to get up and get the Tecate from the fridge myself.  Unfortunate they didn't slow down and focus on what was important for their restaurant.  Relax, take a breath, and the two girls would likely have noticed what was failing.  The Pico de Gallo felt like the leftovers from someone else's table - only 4 pieces of tomato, so not really like Gallo at all.  Wet onion and cilantro. The flautas were 85% tortilla, and 15% dry, unflavoured beef - which we could barely get down they were so dry.  Only the green salsa made them better.  I've had much, much better.  The tacos were standard - but the Al Pastor meat was stiff and firm, but with an okay flavour.  A bit sweet from the pineapple, but uneventful.  The best part of our meal were the Cochinita Pipil Tacos which were full of flavour and topped nicely with a lot of shredded pork in soft shells, topped with pickled onion - very well done!!  Had they not been that excellent, Mexitaco would have received one star.  Will not go back. There are other places in Toronto that have stepped up their game to bother with the terrible service and the terrible flautas."}
{"text":"I actually went to this place based on the Yelp reviews since I just moved into the neighbourhood. I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. I'm certainly not gonna go here again and while I don't like to write a negative review, I feel like I have to give people a heads up about my experience there.  So the decor in there is cool, the staff was nice, and the desserts were great (churro and fried ice cream). That's why they're getting 2 stars. But the disappointment was in the meals. I ordered the pollo asado, and it came with the tiniest, thinnest piece of chicken I've ever been served at a restaurant. I mean it was miniscule. So basically I paid $16 for like a dollar's worth of chicken and then a plate full of beans and guacamole. It was pretty tasty I guess, but all I could think about was how good it would be with some chicken. So my gf ordered the burrito de camarones al pastor. It's supposed to come with shrimp and pineapple, it's the highest priced burrito on their menu. It had a minimal amount of shrimp and 2 pieces of pineapple. So you're paying $13 for mostly sour cream and beans.  The bottom line is that I dropped $60 for dinner at this place and I made myself a sandwich when I got home because I was that hungry. This place looks cool and they were nice, they seem to use fresh ingredients, but the fact is that they are stretching out their ingredients by stuffing their meals full of stuff like beans and sour cream and skimping out on the meat. That's obviously better for their bottom line but it wasn't good for our dining experience and they lost any chance of repeat business from us because of it. Maybe we caught them on a bad night or something, maybe it's not always like this. But they totally chinsed out on our dinners the night that we went. I would rather that they charged me more but gave me an actual satisfying meal. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Great! Pulled chicken tonga and fish tacos ware well made.  And to me... that means --- sauce not too watery, fish was perfect firmness.  Price point was perfect (unlike Xola which misses that mark).  Chips are made fresh in House, definitely needed in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Ah almost like being on Juarez having some tacos del pastor! The only difference is the price... In Mexico 2.00 in Toronto 8.99 ;-)"}
{"text":"Mexitaco is a diamond in the rough of what is the sad state of Mexican eateries in the downtown core.  With all of my favorites like chorizo tacos and flautas, it's a wonder I don't go to Mexitaco more often.  Not only is it great in comparison to other Mexican places in town, it's great in comparison to pretty much all of the restaurants in its immediate vicinity.    Their very tiny patio is open during milder months of the year, and also incredibly popular.  One great way to beat the rush and save some money is to go in the afternoons and hit up their lunch specials, which offer some pretty great deals.  If you aren't sure what you will like, ask the servers for a recommendation, or just go with friends and order a variety of dishes to share.  I highly recommend the chorizo, even if you aren't familiar with it or don't think you like sausage.    The guacamole is great, as is every single one of their desserts (although special props go to buneulo).  There aren't a ton of meatless choices so your veggie friends might consider a trip here an empty victory - although have them ask the server if substitutions or meatless versions of existing items can be arranged.  The staff is great and always willing to go the extra mile to provide a great meal.    One caveat - the wait for food can be a bit much, especially if you're really hungry.  So go ahead and order a basket of chips and guac, a margarita (or jarritos if you're driving), and stave off the hunger during the inevitable wait.  Just remind yourself, it will all be worth it and you can't rush quality."}
{"text":"We stopped in recently and had a horrible experience.  The drinks we ordered tasted so horrible that we asked for some additional Clamato to add to offset the taste. The waitress gave us a lot of attitude for that small request. We ordered 2 tacos and shortly after ordering, another waitress came by confirming 1 taco- which we corrected saying we had ordered 2. We settled and said the 1 would be fine, not to inconvenience them. She gave us more attitude and said the 2 were ready and she would be right out. We waited 5 minutes and feeling very uneasy about how horrible the service and overall experience was so far, we reluctantly paid for our untouched drinks and left before any sign of a taco came out.  I never had a problem the last time we went but I would never go back. There are so many other amazing restaurants in this city and no one should settle for poor service, rude waitresses, and horrible drinks that you to pay $20.00 for when you hardly took a sip from."}
{"text":"I visited with my family of four and I wasn't impressed.   First, the location, there is no accessible parking we had to wait to park on the street. Secondly, we visited on a day that was hot and the place didn't have any AC which was not pleasant for a sit down dinner.  The good, the service was great. The waiters were nice and friendly and made suggestions as to what we should try. We tried the specialty drinks and they were great.  We ordered the guacamole with tortilla chips which was ok. Then we ordered the pollo asado which for the price was a small portion of chicken with a little bit of the side dishes, not worth $16. Then we tried the tacos- tacos de tinga, tacos de carne asada, tacos al pastor, and tacos de pescado asado. The portions were small and the flavours were sub-par.   For dessert we tried the churros.  These churros were heavily coated with cinnamon that left a bad after taste.  Unfortunately, I would not return because I can find other places that serve a filling meal, that tasted good for the price we paid."}
{"text":"Very good taste soup and taco, cheaper than average Mexican places in Toronto ( I believe that Mexican places are generally overpriced in Toronto), feels more authentic here."}
{"text":"Portions may look small but trust me they fill you up and very good to share. The nachos are really good but make sure you have guac and some protein to it which makes it better. Tacos are really good.  The tostadas are filling and good."}
{"text":"Tonight was so hot the ice in my michelada melted completely in under 10 minutes.   That said, it was still a delicious, refreshing counterpart to the umamifest that was my bowl of pozole.   Great pozole garnish selection, including radishes, lettuce (could have used a bit more), onions, dried oregano, cayenne powder and fried tortilla chips, plus they also gave me their usual entree accoutrements of pickled onions, mild salsa, salsa verde and lime slices.   The pork in the soup was perhaps a bit too lean, therefore not as tender as I would have liked.   There were only two servers who were super sweet but just too swamped to handle a full patio and dining room with efficiency so I suggest going in the afternoon or earlier in the week (like a Tues or Wed) if you need your Mexi-fix in a hurry."}
{"text":"A real pleasant surprise!  Food was amazing, service was amazing. Everyone in my party loved the food.    A real neighborhood gem! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Expected much more from this place, which claims to be \"Mexican ambassador\" in Toronto. I have eaten food worse than this but let's put it in few short points: - Burrito's (13$) are very dry, bland and uninteresting. Especially the chicken in it is the simplest cooked dry chicken white meat mixed with boring beans and rice. A salad that comes with it is a tiny serving of dry paper lettuce type...and more rice on the side.  - Tacos (8$) were very greasy (small portions too) - Guacamole (8$) was a bit on a not-very-flavorful side and very small portion (not for sharing!) - Nachos was greasy I will not be going back and do not recommend it. I am still trying to find a good Mexican place in this city...."}
{"text":"Do not order take-out from this restaurant! Mexitaco is a 20 minute drive from my house and by the time I got home my enchilada and taco was soggy (I do take out all the time from other mexican restaurants and this has never happened). The worst part was the enchilada was bland but the baja shrimp tacos were OK. For $13.99 the enchilada portion was disappointing. On the bright side the lady that took my order seemed polite."}
{"text":"Went once, never been back.  The portion sizes were extremely small for the price.  Food was bland and unexciting.  Was with a group of 4, all agreed that pretty well all dishes basically sucked.  When in need of Latin food I walk 10 mins west to La Bella Managu (Nicaraugra) or East 10 mins to Tacos El Asador.  Both are WAY better than Mexi.  There is no value here - total rip off for food that is not much better than the straight-out-of-the-freezer junk in the supermarket."}
{"text":"Walked into this place by chance after finding Banjara closed due to a maintenance issue.  We were pleasantly surprised at how successful this random selection was.    We ordered the nacho-quesadilla-jalapeno popper platter for an appetizer, all three of which were winners (especially the jalapeno poppers!  You'll need a spice neutralizer on hand for those).  We also had the chicken tacos, as well as the chorizo tacos. We both favored the chorizo tacos, but the chicken wasn't without it's charm.  Sadly, no fish tacos were on the menu.    All in all, everything was yummy; the guac, the salsa verde, and the corn tortillas were all tops."}
{"text":"Decent food but there is better in the city. The Azteca soup though is the Best thing on the menu. The crunch from the tortilla and mixture of flavours will hit the spot"}
{"text":"I ventured in to this restaurant at the recommendation of everyone I know.  Looking for good mexian food, I'd passed this place more times than I could count but had never gone in.  It is always busy and now i know why.  I loved it and will be going back as often as my taste buds can warrant the heat!"}
{"text":"Micheladas were great....we ordered the platter of nachos, guacamole, fajitas., The guacamole was really good, fajitas bland....... Would go back and try again......"}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time about 10 years ago when we lived in the west end. Happened to be in that part of town and stopped in because my husband was craving their Pozole (pork soup).  I ordered a burrito and quesadillas for the kids.  Not sure if the cook has changed but the food has definitely lost it's lustre...  So sad--they did have some pretty good food back in the day."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place and stopped in to check it out with my wife.  We had a great first impression! I had the steak tacos and my wife had the Baha fish, everything was fresh and tasty.  Very authentic Mexican, very friendly  staff and owners. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The guacamole is not bad, with fresh corn tortilla chips. Maybe slightly watery, but it was served icy cold so possibly it accounts for why it seemed a bit bland. It needs a hot day and some spicy food to go beside it, so possibly a re-do. Grabbing food from a near-freezing fridge might also mean they don't make 'fresh' foods that often, which weakens flavor.  The chicken enchiladas en mole seemed thrown together - half-cold and nearly empty of chicken, it seemed more like a messy bland appetizer than a $16 entree. The coldness (or reheated-ness / unfreshness) of the tortillas made them a bit cardboardy, and not generous and toasty/corny in texture and taste. There was a tiny amount - about one chicken wing's worth in total - of meat hiding in the four enchiladas, and they managed to include two small bones. An outright meagre portion of a cheap ingredient.  The mole sauce was sort of OK, maybe tasting a bit like chocolate syrup, not a subtle blending of savor and spice. From a jar? And since there was nothing inside filling the enchiladas there was little to soak up the sauce with, not that I really wanted to. I still can't believe I went there for dinner and they brought me that bizarro plate of dark brown shiny guck with so little food on it.  I really have to read other reviews & then go back to see if it was really that amazingly bad. I went in hungry and left unsatisfied, and feeling a bit unwell (it passed in a day.)"}
{"text":"Really great.  Real Mexican.  Everything about it seemed authentic.  Legit.   The evening we dropped in, the Air conditioning wasn't working.  So it was hot.  Really hot.  Really really really hot.  Just made it even more legit.   Something about being super hot, drinking ice cold Estrella and eating really tasty tacos, tostada's and nachos.   It was really hot.  Did I mention that already?  That didn't stop us from sampling loads of items off the menu.    We had the tinga chicken tostada, the ceviche tostado, carnitas tacos, the Baja tacos, the tinga nachos.  It's fast so we were able to order almost tapas style...adding a dish at a time, trying it and then deciding on what to have next.    All the dishes we tried were amazing.  My son even tried everything.  That says something right there.  It's good good food.    The service was really friendly and easy.   The owner was super nice and real.    We ate way too much.  Had a great time.  Tried a ton of menu items.     And the bill was really reasonable.    We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Eh, I expected to eat good Mexican food since my friend took us there(and then he regretted it as well). I am not an expert, but what I had there wasn't even close to good. If I have to describe their food, it's simply bland and dry. We got tacos in the beginning and those were quite good actually. And that was the only good thing I could say about the place. Then we ordered the main dishes and that's when it went downhill. You know your food's bad when the only part you enjoy is the bean sauce. That was mine We were 4 people, and I tried everyone's food. None if it was good. My friend got quesedilla, which compared to the last place I went to, was a pain to eat.  I also tried the fish, which I probably could have made better myself.  For me 2 stars is exactly how much the food in there deserves, and that's because of the tacos. Unfortunately it's not even cheap to justify the quality. Service was below average. We were the only people in there and we got almost no attention. In the end it took them so long to split our bill in 2.  I rarely have negative impressions of the places I visit, but I will definitely skip going to that one again."}
{"text":"This place has really authentic mexican food, and tasty guacamole. They do have  a few great vegetarian options but be careful ordering any of the dishes and asking for 'no meat' because you might be in for a surprise. I've walked all the way home with my take-out only to find chicken or some other white(ish) meat in the dish.   I'd recommend going on a nice day so you can hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for lunch on Friday and it was empty when we got there(12:30 ish). The servers are very nice and helpful, and importantly they were fast.  However, I think the food was very overpriced.. two tacos are $5.99. And that's if you don't add any cheese or guacamole each for $1.99 EACH (what taco doesn't come with cheese already?...)   I got the carne asada burrito with cheese (again $1.99 for that cheese). I was disappointed with what I got. It tastes worse than Burrito Boyz burritos.  I did try my coworkers quesadilla, which was pretty good. But the portions were very small again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times already and really enjoyed their food, service and atmosphere. Their food tasted authentic comparing to ones I've had in Mexico, nicely flavoured and delicious corn tortillas! We ordered a bunch of tacos and some were better than others.  The staff is super friendly. Atmosphere is great, they have live singers and dancers when we were there. It is a little on the dark side (haha) and does get pretty loud. Parking is hard to find so we usually park at the plaza across the street.   Would return and would recommend."}
{"text":"I found this hidden little gem on my hunt for authentic Mexican food so I decided to check it out and was extremely happy that I did. Everything was crazy delicious. Their ceviche tostada tasted super fresh, everything in all the tacos were well-seasoned, and their salsas were the perfect companion for it all. Portions were also great for the price and the wait staff were super friendly. Felt like a little piece of Mexico was brought back here to Toronto. Definitely coming back here to check their mariachi band out and obviously for their great food.   Yo encontré esta joya oculto mientras estaba buscando de comida mexicano auténticos. Entonces yo decidí probarlo y estaba muy contento con mi decisíon. Todo la comida era muy delicioso. La ceviche es tan fresco y los tacos estaban bien sazonado. Las porciones son más que suficiente y el servicio fue muy excelente. Se sentía como una parte de Mexico estaba aquí en Toronto Este. !!Definitivamente estoy volviendo aquí por su mariachi y obviamente por su comida muy sabrosa!"}
{"text":"Good cozy atmosphere, nice helpful staff, quick service, great music and good food. First time there and just noticed a couple weeks ago."}
{"text":"Overall, the food (pork, chicken, and veggie tacos) was decent, but could have used a bit more \"punch\" (zest/flavour).  Be disappointed by the \"fried\" ice cream though: It isn't an authentic ice cream wrapped and then fried--it's just ice cream covered in crunchy fried bits.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Not bad. If I'm in the neighbourhood again and feel like having Mexican, I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican food I have found in Toronto.  Very reasonably priced, service is polite but could be more friendly.  Food is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This little corner spot has been on my Saturday morning radar for a few weeks now and finally we found it open at noon. Sure it looks like more of a bar than a fast food place but with a cute small side lot patio it could easily pass as a brunch spot for lunch and beers.  The bar features Dos Equis on tap which would go nicely with some chips and hot sauce, along with guacamole of course.  We ordered chorizo tacos along with a shrimp taco and they were both perfect! Loved their hot sauce too. The shrimp was fresh and tasty and the chorizo dripped bright red fat as usual and was hearty and filling as well.  The chips and guacamole was a nice compliment to the savoury tacos. Great spot and I'd love to go again."}
{"text":"This place is so unexpected, given the location, and given that Toronto is not really known for having great mexican food. I came in with zero expectations, and left really happy.  In short, the BAJA fish tacos, were really really good. The batter was light, super crispy, and piping hot. They give you two tortillas with this one because the fish is too big for the one. Other things I ordered and enjoyed: Shrimp Ceviche Tostatas Chorizo tacos El Pastor tacos  Prices are REALLY good. You get small tacos, but since the price is good, you can order a bunch and feel full.  The service is fast, friendly, and attentive. They were great at splitting the bill with a huge group of people, and were organized. The restaurant is clean, but has that authentic divey feel that you want when you go to Mexican bar. They have an ok selection of Draft beer, happy to see Lowenbrau on there, as that's usually not an option.   I'm really happy with this place, and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was very hungry on my way back home in the evening when I decided to get some Mexican food. I ordered one Nachos (good quantity) and one Taco! Very nice food and would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to a real taco outside the state of California! Okay that may be a little far-fetched but this place is damn good nonetheless. I'm fairly discerning so in order to impress me you gotta be really on your game. AND this restaurant did just that."}
{"text":"Great spot good quality food they only thing is, it's way over priced if they were more reasonably priced it would have way more customers.  Even better spots downtown near Kensington are cheaper and much better.  Overall its great very friendly staff and enjoy the environment."}
{"text":"Honestly, don't let the looks from the outside or (sometimes the people) deter you from entering or wanting to stay because you will potentially miss out on a great experience! Please note I only say that due to how some of my friends reacted when I suggested this restaurant and they thought some of the patrons inside looked questionable - however, after reassuring that everything would be fine, it actually was, and turned out way better and more than what I had originally expected.  So I popped by on a Sunday with no line ups or deafening crowds and the service was on point, attentive and very friendly. My friends and I ordered some baja fish tacos; shrimp ceviche; tacos de carne asada; tacos de tinga; and started off with some guacamole nachos that were delicious! My friends planned a surprise for me by giving the staff my cake ahead of time and it went off without a hitch to which I was definitely shocked, appreciative and happy, all the while unbeknownst to me! I also ordered a dessert thing of churros that came with 2 dipping sauces. Both were pretty tasty.  After that, everything was pretty smooth sailing and I ended up giving them some of my cake to try. The wait staff were extremely sweet, and super friendly - honestly it's one of the best experiences at a Mexican restaurant I've had and I plan on coming back and enjoying more of their menu!   I say Mexitaco is a definite must try if in the area or just craving for some tacos and you're not down to go all the way to Seven Lives for that."}
{"text":"Their burritos have improved!   They're just as delicious but now they're BIGGER!   So if you're looking for dinner/lunch-for-tomorrow, grab a chicken or beef burrito and enjoy.  That's all i usually snag at this joint.  I'm not as adventurous as most, in that i go with what i know.      Also, if you're interested in spicy, the burrito might not be for you, unless you want to douse it in red or green sauce.  Might i recommend the diablo?  Also note:  I'm usually too stuffed for desert, but the flan was astounding!  I'd go there for flan alone.  I WILL go there for flan alone."}
{"text":"From Mexico City, I longed an authentic place that I could call \"my personal heaven\" here it is... Not perfect but it's delicious and in particular de drinks, salsas, and great tacos that are good and just right for me.  The ceviche tostadas revived a long lost love for fish.... I no longer think it's gross I love fish again.   Come here try stuff you never have tried before and be prepared for a pleasant surprise at the most reasonable price in the city I call it best value Mexican food in town.  If you think you like Ceasars or Bloody Mary try Ojo Rojo!!!! It will blow you away.  Gabriela is an amazing host."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Pleasantly surprised by how beautiful and delicious this spot was. Their menu was authentic and extensive! The food was DELICIOUS and service was even better. I'll be coming back here and have already recommended it to friends. Truly enjoyed my meal, we got the Baja fish tacos, Baja shrimp tacos, Nachos with jalapenos and a coronita with spicy ceasar mix! I gave it give stars because there's lots of room for seating the place is laid out well, our server helped us understand the menu and made reccomendations and there was a poster of Frida in the bathroom so ... Yeah"}
{"text":"I would say it's a decent place to get your Mexican fix. The Baja tacos were crispy but a bit too battered. The pulled pork had no real taste and a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on this place I was sadly disappointed. I was really craving Mexican food.  When we first entered the restaurant, it had a funky washroom cleaner smell too it. Not sure why it had such a weird ordour. After a while we got used to it and didn't notice the smell.  Service: 3/5 Servers were friendly and prompt. Food came out in a decent time.  Food 2/5: For appetizer we had the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was okay. I prefer my avocado more chunky, but I did like the chips that came with it.  We got a variety of different tacos:  We ordered the shrimp, beef, and baha fish taco. The best by far was the baha fish taco. The piece of fish was cooked perfectly and the batter was nice and thin. I felt like the shrimp and beef taco was missing a bit of coleslaw or something that would make it stand out more.   We also ordered the pulled pork quesadilla - which was my least favourite thing of the night. The pulled pork was salty and the cheese made the whole thing overly salty. I woudn't recommend ordering this. Stick to the tacos.  The place has quite a number of seats and since we came on a weekday there were quite a few tables. I did get busier once the rush our hit.  Not sure I'd be back."}
{"text":"A somewhat limited review since I came in during a work lunch break (no drinks) and I went for the fajita platter (Texmex) rather than possibly more authentic Mexican items on the menu.  Though the fajita platter is fairly straightforward and hard to screw up, I have to say that the meat had better seasoning on it (likely pre-marinated) than other places I've had it at. The veggies and onions also likely had prep in advance, as they were more slow cooked and deliciously caramelised than other places as well. I went with the steak which was pretty good quality, and the two others I was with went for the chicken which was a platter for two. A tip that the platter for two will save you a few bucks rather than ordering two fajita entrees separately.  Another positive aspect was having authentic and spicy salsas compared to Pace-type chunky salsas.  Not much else to report on, but we also shared the churros. Since we were sharing, they offered to prepare them in smaller 6 pieces rather than the 2 long ones which was a nice gesture (easier to split with 3 people). They also did bill splitting with no issue, which included the single churro order 3 ways, and splitting the fajitas for 2 on two separate bills.   So far, so good, and looking forward to trying other things."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican restaurant/bar. We were happy with the food, the atmosphere, and the service. They made this place look and feel genuinely Mexican.   We had the quesadilla de tanga and the tacos de tanga and they were DELICIOUS! The taste of that chipotle sauce blended with the pulled chicken and cheese was incredible.  We also tried the Nachos which were also very good and came in a good portion.  Overall this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came here pretty late on Sunday night (9am). Place had like 3 other tables of customers. We ordered tacos and quesadillas. The food is great for sharing and if you don't really know what you want. Really tasty as well. The food comes with two hot salsa sauces and limes. The interior was quite clean and homey. Service was good. The washrooms are in the basement, which I didn't really like. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We were living in the West End for a few weeks while our house was under renovation. I have a really special place in my heart for Mexican food and was really missing our fav place on the Danforth, La Cabana. On a recommendation, we walked like 20 paces from our friend's apartment where we were staying to Mexitaco.   They have a really broad menu, all authentic, perfectly seasoned, cheese-covered, corn tortilla-rolled Mexican food which comes so quickly and for such an incredible price. They even bring a little tray of a selection of salsas to your table to burn the hell out of your taste buds before your food comes!   They have fantastic Margaritas and a seriously stocked bar.   There is limited seating indoors and it can get a little warm. But, that's where the takeout option comes in handy.   Lastly, we ended up going 6 times in 5 weeks. I guess that means it's really good."}
{"text":"SO SO GOOD. First, I love the decor of the restaurant. It's so different and fun which creates a nice environment to be in. We ordered the Baja fish tacos, the pork with pineapple, and beef tacos. It was SO good. Our favourite was the pork with pineapple. The baja tacos doesn't come in 2 but it's because it's much bigger than the ones that do come in 2. We went around 12 and it wasn't full but still busy. The waitress and waiter was extremely friendly asking if we're enjoying everything etc. Up to when we paid the waiter looked at our bill and was checking out what we ate and what we can the next time. Love it!"}
{"text":"I came back from SXSW determined to find a place where I could find my new favourite drink, a Michelada, in Toronto. Google pointed me towards Mexitaco.   Basically, it's just a Caesar with beer instead of clamato. Limey, salty, and spicy.  The one I had at Mexitaco wasn't quite as good as what the Hotel San Jose in Austin serves up - but it definitely satisfied the craving. And, I'll be sure to stop back in the next time I find myself wanting one."}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos, nachos, bean dip and guac in the city. Can't believe it has taken me so long to review! Bathroom is tiny."}
{"text":"Really good authentic non-texmex food.  The chicken burrito was delicious."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm so glad I came! The restaurant was empty so our service was super fast and the waiter was extremely friendly. As for the restaurant's appearance, at first glance from the outside, it looks unfinished and a bit cheap (sorry), but upon entering you're pleasantly surprised with a rustic atmosphere with Mexican themed decor everywhere. Even their light fixtures were so unique and I just loved everything about this place. To order I got the camarones al pastor (I think that's what it's called) and my friend got the ground beef nachos which we both enjoyed. I'd have to say, however, the absolute best part of my meal was the churros for dessert! These were honestly the best churros I've ever tasted and I love that they're made fresh in-house everyday. They also make their caramel sauce from scratch--I kind of embarrassed myself by slurping up the rest lol.   Overall, I had a great time here and really enjoyed the service, atmosphere and food so I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the enfrijoladas with chorizo ($13.99) to go. The best way to describe this is like a tortilla lasagna filled with chorizo and drowned in bean sauce, sour cream and cheese on top. It took about 10-15 minutes for them to make it. When we got it, it was piping hot. It also smelled amazing. When we opened it up, it looked like soup covered in sour cream. It tasted pretty good though. More bean than I'd like, and that chorizo was undistinguishable under the beans, but whatever it was, it tasted good.  The restaurant itself is relaxing. Cute fact. Their salt and pepper are served in what looks like drink bottles."}
{"text":"Mexitaco is a great little spot.   I love the refried beans that come with everything.   The churros could use some work - churros aren't supposed to shred the top of your mouth from deep fried unfreshness.  The flautas are spicy and glorious and this is the closest to traditional Mexican food in this part of town. The Tortilla soup is one of my winter staples!   Service is always friendly, quick and kind."}
{"text":"Is it easy on the eyes?  No, but didn't your Mama ever tell you not to judge a book by it's cover? Mexitaco might not look like much on the outside, but the food is the most authentic version of Mexican Street food I have had in the city.  Sure the dining area is a little sketchy looking, the decor a bit dated and the Spanish music videos might be playing a little bit too loud, but you're here for the food not the atmosphere so tell your eyes to shove it and listen to your mouth.  The guac is creamy goodness, and the tacos are greasy deliciousness and all of it is best washed down with a bucket of Coronas or an ice cold Jarritos. For first timers I recommend the Taco platter so you can try a bit of everything ,after all variety is the spice of life."}
{"text":"I really love Mexican food, so I had high hopes that this place would live up to the reputation. Plus I was really exited when I saw actual Mexican people working there. This must be authentic I thought.   We collectively ordered many of the traditional items, tacos (of course), quezadilla, pico de gallo, horchata drink, hibiscus drink, and nachos.   The tacos were disappointing, the meat was so dry, there was hardly any salsa on then or garnish. The quesadilla was small - nothing wrong with that - but it was so bland, no spices, no flavour. The food was missing the Mexican spice and taste I know and love, it was almost like the cooks were blind or had run out of all the ingredients and were serving food with barely nothing on it.   I mentioned our bad experience to the server whom in turn mentioned it to the cook, who says that is how he does it! My family we all understand Spanish and the conversation between the server and the cook was clearly audible. Basically the cook said \"that is how I cook, if they don't like it they can leave.\" In the end we paid our meal left no tip and got out.   This was the first and last time we will be going here."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Don't let the tired interior fool you, if you  want some great Mexican definitely try Mexitaco."}
{"text":"The service at Mexitaco was excellent. Found the service to be fast and efficient. My food was out within 15 mins. The food was astonishing, especially what I had to eat The Alambre and the chicken quesadillas. Also I tried the margaritas and churros. Very good!  Highly recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally see a real Mexican restaurant in the East York and Scarborough area. as we did not have one in the area. After living 15 years in the are and we finally have one. Went last Sunday, and the food was AMAZING. I have been several times to Mexico, and tried authentic real Mexican food, like (Tinga Tostadas.) Tried them at Mexitaco with a side of beans and it tasted great as the ones in Mexico. I also asked for the drink menu and had a Mangonada and it was very well prepared, tasted very good, and for dessert the churros are very delicious as well. Very recommended if you come here.  The presentation was really nice and creative. I loved the atmosphere, all the lighting and decor in the establishment. Especially the music was very authentic. This is a very recommended spot. Will be for sure coming back with friends to enjoy the tasty and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"So this place looks sort of frightening. I walked by once in the warmer months, and the outside patio was busy and looked fun and inviting. When I went back last night in the middle of a freezing winter day, and no one was inside except a couple of staff behind the bar, it did not look welcoming at all. In fact, I said to Brian S that we should order one thing at a time \"just in case\". What I meant was, just in case it's absolutely awful and we don't want to stay.  Fortunately, appearances can be deceiving. The stark uncomfortable decor hides the well seasoned food and pleasant staff who work at Mexitaco. We ordered a few Negro Modelo beers and tucked into a small portioned, but pretty tasty, plate of guacamole with homemade corn tortilla chips. The chips were really good, and the guac was OK. It could have rrbeen fresher, but the side plate of sauces was nice to dip the chips into also.  I asked the server what his favorite dishes on the menu were, because there is A LOT to choose from. He was really friendly and made a few suggestions. The one we went with was the tacos suadero, which was a really flavorful beef with onions. We easily split the 4 tacos, adding our own sauces from the accompaniments offered.  Other people came in while we were sitting there; one ate in, and one who seemed like a regular who was doing take-out. He had the right idea. The Mexican video show on the TV was hilarious entertainment though! I especially loved the cheesy boy band with their cougar-esque well-endowed girlfriends. Courtney Cox would love that.  We were too full to try anything else, the bill came to $34 (including 3 beers). I would definitely return to try some of the enchiladas and other plates, especially in the warm months on the patio. Ole!"}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos which weren't half bad. It was a decent price and comes with 4 small tacos. I've def tried better tacos else where. I wouldn't go too far out of my way for this place. But if you are in the neighborhood worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican cuisine. Happy they moved to this location because now Scarborough can enjoy the great atmosphere they've created. I had a pork burrito with grilled pineapple and it was so tasty. The salsa it served with is so fresh with the right amount of heat. Must try Mexitaco!"}
{"text":"Sorry for your loss Bloorcourt Village but Mexitaco now belongs to us East Yorkers and Scarberians *evil laugh*   Hubby and I caught them during their soft opening; so they're still finishing their decor and feeling out the neighborhood. I really appreciate that their platters are two tacos each which was more budget friendly for us while giving us more flexibility in ordering other menu items. Our favorites were the fish cerviche tostada (fresh and flavorful), tinga (deliciously smoky and spicy) and deep fried ice cream (delightful flavors and textures). Tortillas are not made in house but are made fresh and delivered daily.  The owners and cooks are all from Mexico City. Family run: dad is head chef, mom is hostess and waits tables, and their son is the bartender. If you want to know anything about Mexican culture ask the cool bartender, Alex, who also happens to be a fellow Yelper! We had an engaging talk about the biopic Selena (played brilliantly by Jennifer Lopez), Lucha Libre wrestling, the origins of chocolate and vanilla, all the while listening to lively Cumbia music.  This is the closest you'll ever get to the authentic flavors and feel of Mexico City in Toronto my friends. Make a run for the border!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good quality Mexican food in Toronto.  It's even harder to find a place that isn't downtown.  Well thankfully a good friend mentioned this place had moved and was now in the east end.  Blink and you might miss it but it's on the corner of Victoria Park and St Clair (right across the No Frills).    It's small inside but they pack in a lot of tables.  Went on a Friday night and the place was jumping jumping.  As the night wore on it just got busier (apparently around 8-9pm there is a show Friday nights).  We were finished eating by that time and stayed a bit to see if started but we ended up leaving as we didn't want to hog the table when others needed it.  I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos and the baha fish tacos (you get 2 of each).  They were delicious.  No greasy, not bland, just delicious.  The owners/staff are from what I have heard are Mexican.  So they know what they are cooking.    The atmosphere is lively, the service is friendly and the food is GREAT.  I will definitely add this as one of my regular rotations of deliciousness"}
{"text":"I love coming here.  This is one of the few good Mexican places with a patio.  I don't really like dining in the restaurant itself.  I find it a bit too warm and tight. As soon as the sun is out and i'm craving some Mexican, I come here. My usual order is La Parrillada and a sangria.  La Parrillada is a large fajita style dish that can be shared.  The service is friendly.  I've tried the pulled pork before it was very tastey but i find La Parrillada the best value for just hanging in the patio with friends...  I haven't sampled many of the other dishes as they didn't look appealing.  I'm sure many of the other Yelper's comments about quality consistency between the different plates is valid."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree more with Roy A. Appallingly disappointing considering the buzz. My friend got the veggie burrito and it was, indeed frozen vegetables. The only flavor I could extract from my vegetarian enchiladas was salt. I understand the argument that maybe the veggie options aren't the best representation of Mexican cuisine, but fresh ingredients and spicing do go a long way. Don't waste your dough, compadres."}
{"text":"It is not easy to get authentic Mexican food in Scarborough. This place was excellent. Had a variety of tacos and were very happy. The restaurant looks like you just stepped off a beach in  Puerto Vallarta."}
{"text":"We came for a friends birthday on a weekday. The place wasn't crowded and this is definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants in Toronto. The food had a lot of flavour, staff were very friendly. I will be coming back here again!   The only negative comment is that I wish they had more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The first time I drove by and saw that a Mexican restaurant was finally coming to my hood, I squealed with delight. We waited very impatiently for them to open, and had our first visit on only their second day of being open.  We decided to get a few different things to share, so we could taste lots of different dishes. We started with fresh guacamole with the most delicious, hand made tortilla chips I've ever had. Then we had a chicken tinga tostada and shrimp tacos. We also shared the carne asada, which was a minute steak with 5 fresh corn tortillas. Absolutely everything was freshly made in house. The carne asada on the corn tortillas tasted exactly like what we've had in Mexico.   Not only was the food home made, but so was the entire restaurant. Our waiter told us that everything in the restaurant was handmade, including the tables, the bar, and the wood panels on the walls.  This is truly a family run restaurant with home made food right out of mama's kitchen, if only you were lucky enough to have a Mexican mama."}
{"text":"If I were to describe MEXITACO in two words: SPICE OVERLOAD  I love tacos and usually don't mind a bit of spice, but I found that the taco spices here were too overwhelming--almost to the extent where every taco I tried tasted like the same slurry of flavours. Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad (I enjoyed it), but it lacked variety to fully please my flavour palate. Like the tacos, the guacamole also tasted like salt and a jumble of different spices. If it wasn't green, I wouldn't have even known that there was avocado in it!  As for service, it was decent. Ordering was no problem and food came fast, but no one was refilling water and asking for the bill required a bit of effort.   Overall, decent restaurant, but will not be my go-to for tacos."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside and there's not much in terms of parking (though some street parking is available), but this is seriously the best Mexican food we've found anywhere in the GTA! Which is amazing because tacos have been a pregnancy craving of mine, and before finding this place, there was nowhere I could convince hubby to go consistently. Now he asks to come here.  We both get the chicken tinga quesadillas (comes with a side of fresh crema) and the Baja fish taco. At first, we were annoyed that there's an upcharge for cheese and guac, which makes it a pretty expensive single taco. However, it is huge! Almost double the size of tacos from some competitors, and the fish is brought in fresh. We're full after a quesadilla and one taco, maybe a churro.   When you sit down, they also bring over a little caddy of limes and salsas. They have a nice selection of Mexican sodas too. Cannot speak to the alcohol situation due to pregnancy, but they have a full bar. Overall, we find this restaurant tastier and more authentic than anywhere else we've been for Mexican in the GTA."}
{"text":"After hearing great reviews about this restaurant, I decided to give it a try since I was in the neighbourhood.  First thing to note would be that the parking situation is not ideal. There is no parking lot and you have to either park on a residential street and walk 5 minutes to the restaurant or park at the No Frills or McDonald's across the street and risk getting towed or ticketed.  We visited on a Thursday night and the restaurant had a few tables occupied. We were given a menu and water promptly.  After looking over the menu, we settled on a Tostada and 5 different tacos. Before the food arrived, the server came with two hot sauces and fresh lime to squeeze on the tacos. Both of the hot sauces were not very hot and it was hard to distinguish them from each other besides the colour.  Shrimp Ceviche Tostada ($5.99) Fresh shrimp tossed in a citrus marinade with pico de gallo and two tiny slivers of avocado served on a crispy fried corn tortilla. This dish was quite bland and you could tell that it wasn't cured or marinaded long enough and was quickly tossed prior to serving, thus lacking flavour to be a real ceviche.  Carne Asada Tacos (2 for $6.49) Marinade grilled beef, diced onion and cilantro. The beef was moist but lacked flavour, it seemed like it wasn't marinated but rather quickly seasoned.  Chorizo Tacos (2 for $6.49) Chopped spicy sausage, diced onion and cilantro. These were the best tacos of the night as the chorizo were very flavourful and moist.  Al Pastor Tacos (2 for $6.49) Adobo marinated grilled pork, grilled pineapple, diced onion and cilantro. Pork was bland and the pineapple didn't taste grilled and looked like it came straight from a can.  After eating these 3 tacos, we quickly realized that they weren't easily distinguishable from each other as they all were drowned with the diced onion and cilantro. It would have been nice if they each had different garnishes and more flavour in the meat.  We thought we'd give them another shot so we tried the Baja Tacos.  Baja Fish Taco (1 for $5.49) Large piece of beer battered fish, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo and cilantro. These were quite tasty but the fish was not very crispy and it looked like the oil was a bit old as the batter on the fish was quite dark.  Baja Calamari Taco (1 for $5.49) 3 pieces of beer battered calamari, pico de gallo, chipotle mayo and cilantro. The calamari looked and tasted it came from frozen and were not home made. The batter fell off after biting a piece of calamari and tasted stale.  Overall, the different tacos all tasted very similar to each other as the garnishes were all the same. This place would get a better review if different garnishes were used, the meats were marinated or seasoned more and the oil was fresher. One positive was that the food is quite cheap as the entire bill with tax came to about $40."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is fresh and so full of flavour, and the staff makes you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service. The drink we ordered was a \"double\", but it was pretty weak. The food portions were good, but not huge (don't expect leftovers). They charge extra for cheese on a burrito???"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Found this wonderful Mexican restaurant in Scarborough. Wasn't expecting to find such amazing and authentic Mexican food in Scarborough. First impression was I felt I was teleported to Mexico, the decor was warm and welcoming. We order the nacho, shrimp ceviche tostada, tacos de pescado asado (fish), and to finish off we got the churros. The nacho were okay, they served the crispy nachos. I liked the tacos a lot more. The shrimp and fish was really fresh and the mixture of taste just works. The churros were fresh and warm."}
{"text":"We come here after volleyball league on Thursday. This is one of the few places opened past 10 nearby, not only that but the service is friendly and the food is delicious and authentic! The fully loaded nachos are great when topped with pulled chicken and guacamole, the chips are fresh! Their tacos come in pairs and even though they are on the small side, the come packed with flavour! Great beer list as well!"}
{"text":"This review is for fish tacos ($9 for 4) and a small fish ceviche ($9) from the late night menu.  The food was not half bad.  I could tell these people know what they are doing.  I could also tell they cut corners carefully to fit the prices.  And I am fine with them, because their prices are reasonable/aggressive enough to justify them.  What I love: 1) They know how to make fish food, and the core things that they must do to call it good, namely they manage to maintain an acceptable level of freshness on a shoe string budget.   2) They pan fry the fish fillets, not deep frying them in a batter.  They make damn good nachos in house.  They reheat the corn tortillas by lightly pan frying them.  I haven't seen this trick before, and they pull it off well.  The tortillas are warm, taste fresh (or refreshed) enough, and are soft.  Corners cut:  1) They use non-meaty white fish, likely Basa, instead of meaty white fish.  At just over $2/taco, I expect defrosted fish.  No problem; even restaurants do.  I must stress, though, the fish I had was not fishy or spoiled even at late night.  The issue is this non-meaty white fish has no taste or texture, even though there is sufficient quantity of it.    2) Both tacos and ceviche have onion and cilantro as toppings only.  No diced tomato, not even as a side topping on the spice tray.  I love simple toppings in my fish tacos, yet missing the acidity of tomato is a big miss to me.    Mexitaco is a decent joint operated on a shoe string budget.  There are better fish tacos and ceviche for sure, but I like them enough."}
{"text":"Location of this restaurant is not too inviting, but once inside it is a nice Mexican Cantina. Servers are ok, but could be a little friendlier. We ordered burritos, quesadilla, and fajitas. All very fresh and good taste. The churros as dessert were great! Good value for money, but first you have to get over the threshold of location and outdoor decor. A closed gate before a glass door that has an 'open' sign sends mixed signals. Please check them out!"}
{"text":"My patio season is not considered officially started until my first visit to Mexitaco's east facing patio for stuffed jalapeños and a frozen margarita(s).  Their stuffed jalapeños are NOT for the faint of heart.   We eat a lot of spice and often find these almost too spicy but they are just so good I can't help myself from finishing them off.  Solid 5/5 for these homemade gems.    Their frozen margaritas are pretty average and their unfrozen margaritas are pretty bad.  This is not a cocktail restaurant.   If margaritas are your thing, stick to the frozen.   In reference to their other food, I really cannot comment as we are strictly creatures of habit at this particular place, although everyone around us seems to enjoy their plates.     They are family owned and the service is wonderful - 5/5 again.   They renovated inside&out approx 2 years ago.  The net of this:  lovely outside patio area but uncomfortable seating inside as they changed their tables to barrels which make it virtually impossible to sit with your legs under the table- awkward for more than a few minutes.   Highly recommend for service, stuffed jalapeños  and patio"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff but on a terrible corner of the street. The food was ok, very small portions for the price, didn't like the idea of paying additional money for guac and cheese as a topping. Drinks were reasonably priced but didn't like the idea of bringing glass bottles with a straws for the kids. Also the guacamole had very little texture and much too spicy."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Had to try it out because it's pretty close to us and boy were we pleasantly surprised! Very authentic Mexican food! Tried the pork and chicken tacos... Very good! The fish ceviche tostada... Excellent! And the churros for dessert to die for! Service was great! Don't judge from the outside because once you step in it's like a slice of Mexico. Will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"It's with a heavy heart writing this review. I've only heard great things about this place.  We went over and ordered 3 dishes: jalapeño poppers, a veg burrito and a beef dish (memory fails me on this one).  Jalapeño poppers were perfect. However, the lettuce served with the other 2 dishes were soapy tasting (!).  Also never ever get a veg burrito here. It consisted of rice, beans and frozen vegetables. This was the first time in my life that I had to struggle to finish a burrito.....Very very very dissapointing.    And it's more expensive than the other Mexican joints as well. $50 for two people I would have expected food that was at least palatable..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and give it resounding \"pretty good\" over all.   The food I've had has been more or less tasty each time but the service isn't fantastic. The price to portion ratio is a bit on the small side for some dishes but the platter of assorted tacos for 2 that hovers around the $20 mark is a decent value and a great datenight option.   All in all a good option when I want something better than nachos and don't want to get too far from home."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! Got to Mexitaco at 9pm on a Friday night,... and it was packed and rocking!!! There were singers and traditional dancers, yummy nachos, delish tacos tacos tacos!!!   I was skeptical before I came because of the location and what was here before,... but, now I know Mexitaco is  a little paradise hidden in Scarborough/East York border.  I'll be coming back! back! back!!!"}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time and have never gone in.  Tonight was the night.     Ridiculously cool authentic Mexican food.   Pride screaming from every corner of the place.   The Red White and Green aesthetic permeating everything that we could see.  Mexican soap operas playing on the telly.   Beautiful bronzed women.  Big lips.  Big eyes.  Silicon enhanced bodies.  Caricatures of desire.   The food came quickly.   The food disappeared quickly.   The sign of a good taqueria.    Remarkably different from the El Salvadoran Taco El Asador down the street.   Not \"bad\" different.  Just different different.  Toronto never ceases to amaze me.  Down every street you can find a truly authentic ethnic eatery.     This is a keeper."}
{"text":"Best tacos al pastor I've found in Toronto - better than al asador just a few blocks away, more place to sit (including a patio) and slightly cheaper :)  I like that they serve you the tacos with a few sides (including both a verde hot sauce and a red sauce). The pickled onions are a good side choice too.  I'm probably just going to stick to the pastor when i come here. I pretty much see no need to try anything else."}
{"text":"Stopped here one night with my wife, the food was amazing. We had the mexitaco which is a set of 10 tacos, five different kinds of tacos which came with two kinds of hot sauce, and limes. It was fantastic... the wife and i had beer with these tacos which made them taste better."}
{"text":"Extremely disgusted in this place. I ordered delivery with door dash (best service ever) and was disappointed to see the food that arrived. Extremely over cooked food with browning guacamole.. DISGUSTING. I spoke to one of the employees on the phone and he was very kind and professional and offered me a full refund. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. It's surprisingly hard to find decent Mexican food in the East end. While downtown is spoiled with Mexican goodness, the East end is mostly filled with duds and canned refried beans.   Mexitaco is not one of those places.   Not only is the whole interior done by the owners, the furniture is also homemade from what I hear. I learned that they used to have a Bloor and ossington location for over 16 years, which makes sense; their recipes are great.   We ordered a bean and cheese tostada, a chicken things tostada. 2 carne asada tacos, and 2 chicken things tacos.   Surprisingly, the chicken things tostada and taco were able to differentiate themselves. They had that same tinga flavor but we're still distinct from one another.   The carne asada tacos were my favorite item. Meat was perfectly tender and seasoned. Mmm.   Extra quac and cheese on tacos is 1.99 each, so a little pricey. I don't think they need the extra ingredients though, which is a sign of a good quality taco.   So happy to find such a gem so close to home."}
{"text":"The food was ok but it took 15 min to get guacamole and chips. Then another 30 min to get 4 tacos and a quesadilla. We were thinking of ordering more but we were nervous to do that based on how long it took that point. Also for some reason the guacamole was super spicy. In fact it was spicier than the hot sauce they brought to the table. We asked about the guacamole and were told they make it in one big batch and couldn't do anything. They did not comp the guac even though we had hardly touched it."}
{"text":"Loved the service and loved everything that we ordered (shrimp ceviche, quesadilla tinga, beef tacos, churros, and margarita + coronita). Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - hands down THE BEST and the closest you can get to an authentic Mexican restaurant. It's exactly the kind of vibe I want, located in the corner of a street, run down patio, messy interior, and actual Mexicans working here. I would come here on a regular day just to remind me of the days in Florida.  The people here are super nice, and treat everyone like their regulars. Something I love in a Mexican restaurant that Toronto lacks.   Food here is decent. You can't really go wrong with tacos! They got a good menu with lots to choose from. From traditional Mexican dishes to some with a twist that I never heard of."}
{"text":"Great food in an unexpected neighbourhood.   Fresh tasting.  The burrito al pastor was exceptionally tasty."}
{"text":"A little disappointed coz I guess I expected better. I had the pollo and steak asados it tasted bland nor authenticity. Very tight on the portions. I wasn't expecting fancy but I was expecting bigger potions. I've gone twice just to see if they've made any changes but was still disappointed. I think they need to spice it up."}
{"text":"Came to Mexitaco for the first time. Really good food, we tried the quesadilla's, nachos and fajitas. The fajitas are delicious and the quesadilla's were also good. The tortilla chips are fresh to order and tasty however the nachos are very spicy.   All in all great food and service was not bad either."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for delish tacos. I'm not sure that I'm a specialist on soft shell tacos, but I love what they serve. Tacos taste like they are made from scratch. Try the mixed platter along with a Mexican beer and kick back and enjoy some tasty food in an unpretentious place.   I'm still on a search for the best Mexican food in Toronto and this place is on the top 10 list."}
{"text":"Mexitaco is a small, authentic Mexican restaurant with an extensive menu of interesting dishes, most of which I'd never heard of before. The space doesn't have a whole lot of character (brightly lit, a few Mexican souvenirs on the wall, and a TV playing Mexican music videos), but there is a nice patio in the warm weather.  Browsing the menu things looked promising; all sorts of dishes I'd never heard of: flautas, sopes, enfrijoladas, and so on. Definitely a lot more selection than the usual burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. The tasty chips and salsa we were brought reinforced the positive feeling.  We ordered a few vegetarian dishes (big mistake) and everything went down hill from there. The food looked excellent and all the various sauces were great. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have already mentioned, the vegetables were a total disaster. They literally filled our food with frozen peas, corn, and carrots. The rice and beans weren't great either. A total dissappointment.  I want to like this place so I've returned a few times to see if they've improved. No luck.  So, why 3 stars? First, I had a couple meat eating friends with me and they were very positive about their dishes. So, if you order the meat and avoid the frozen veg you should be good. Second, this place has huge potential. If they would just use some fresh vegetables (red peppers please) and get some better refriend beans (it tasted like Old El Paso for christ sakes) they could be a four or five star place.  Pro Tip: Don't order anything vegetarian. Get the bunuelo for dessert: deep fried tortilla with cajeta, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's sign is a bit small but you definitely don't want to miss this restaurant. The servings are small but very filling. During my visit, I tried almost everything and here's what I think you should get. By far the Baja fish tacos and the Tinga (pulled chicken) tacos is a definite must buy. I also ordered some pork and beef tacos which were a bit on the slightly dryer side. While they were pretty flavourful, the baja fish tacos definitely beats the competition. It has a nice crunchy beer battered crust with a juicy, tender and flavourful basa fish which was accented with onions, cilantro, tomatoes and lime which overall was bursting with flavour and umami. While it's only one taco, the taco itself is pretty long. Also if you're coming with a group of people, unless you're buying two things of tacos, I recommend getting the nachos with Tinga although you should eat fast since the nachos do and will get soggy if you leave them while you're eating your tacos. The corn chips and tortillas are made in house and are delicious and the churros are a perfect dish to complete your meal. This place is a definitely not a place you want to miss."}
{"text":"Here for my friend's birthday. The party started late so it wasn't too busy. Great vibe and great service. Staffs are friendly and very helpful. Nice Mexican themed decors with Latin music.  The food was A-OK. We ordered shrimp (Camarones al Pastors) and chicken (Tacos de Tinga) tacos. The portion is small, in my opinion. I've had better tacos around the same price. This is by far the most basic tacos with such a pricey price. The chicken one was subpar.. It was bland and lack of flavours. We were still hungry after but I mean, after trying their tacos, nothing else here made us want to order more. Definitely not affordable when it comes to food here! Drink selection is good tho. I ordered myself Trojo Rojo , which is beer Bloody Mary.  My expectation was probably built up from all the good reviews. So if you come here with a moderate expectation, you may enjoy it more than I did.  Keep in mind there is no accessible parking. We had to park at McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Athentic Mexican food. Great atmosphere.  Parking is okay with street parking"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was kind of a disaster. My food was bland. My brother's was off-tasting, and my sister-in-law couldn't finish her veggie burrito because all she could taste was tin. Yeah, pretty much just bad. All became clear when I walked by the kitchen to use the bathroom and some 19-year-old punk rocker was manning it alone. Maybe he's the problem. Don't know.  Not sure what's with all the glowing reviews. My theory is Torontonians don't have a good frame of reference for Mexican food. We get much better on the west coast. Either that or this place has gone downhill in a hurry.  Also, overpriced, even if the food was decent, which it isn't."}
{"text":"Although it was a quiet evening when we walked in to make our take-away order, the promise of it being ready in five minutes seemed too good to be true. However, lo and behold, a swift handful of minutes (utilized to make a quick trip to the neighbouring Q2 for a movie rental) after we placed our order, there the bagged Mexican feast was patiently awaiting.  The Maya platter which consists of a large quartered cheesy quesadilla plus monsterously ricey and beany burrito sided with frozen veggie speckled rice, perfectly mushy beans, and salad of iceberg strips was enough to fill both of our not-thaaat-hungry, but very excited bellies.   The beauty of Mexictaco's combos is that you get the choice between beef, veg, chicken, or chorizo for your mains to create different variations of each meal. While the saucy beef worked well in the big burrito and the drier chicken strips made great contrasting textures with the ooey gooey cheese in the quesadilla, I'm already looking forward to mix things up next time.  The room's hanging sombreros and mariachi figurines are fun but the open room is otherwise sparsely decorated and overly bright. I'll probably stick to take out, but if you do the same (and are a fellow super fan of condiments), just be sure to check that you have enough sour cream to last you through your meal - they only provide a decorative zig zag if you don't ask. Don't worry if you forget though - There's always the delicious green chili sauce to keep things interesting."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out after living near it for almost a year and only finding out about it a couple weeks ago during a Mexican food craving we were having. So far it's the most authentic Mexican I've had in Toronto. Just go in with a friend, order the \"Mexitaco\" dish and you will have 12 delicious tacos to try - 3 of each of the 4 main varieties. They serve it up with guacamole and real tortilla chips made from the same tortillas you eat the tacos in (a sign of a proper Mexican place) and have a well stocked menu with all the standards you should expect.  We ordered the jalopeno poppers and the Mexitaco. My mouth was on fire but my heart was aflame for this place. The Mexitaco is $24.99 which works out to $2.08 per taco. Factor in the included guacamole, chips, salsas (verde and regular), the spicy onions and the limes and you should see the real value of that deal for some real tasting Mexican.   The only drawback of the place is the TVs showing Telemundo all the time but I'm no priss. The food was good so I didn't care and in Mexico many tequila/taco joints have the exact same ambiance.  If you're a fine dining snob, don't bother eating in (they do cater though). If you just want to have real Mexican in one of the handful of places in Toronto that has then go here, eat well and shut up."}
{"text":"Just recently came back from Mexico and was missing it; so what better way going to try out this new joint that I have bookmark for awhile.  I was a bit styptical trying out this place since the previous restaurant/bar before this was a dump.  But seeing a bunch of positive reviews I was a bit more excited to check it out.   They have parking on the side but very limited. I just park across the street where McDonald/subway   The interior of the restarting did remind me of Mexico, I love everything about it! It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night! Even the patio seating was full.    Food: Tacos Al Pastor $7.99  comes with 2 tacos  It was a soft corn tortilla, chopped marinated grilled pork and pineapple, onions, cilantros  I felt the portion was a bit small, the pork was a bit hard but overall tasty. But I will add cheese next time.   Gringa Quesadilla $7.99 Marinated grilled pork, grilled pineapple,cheese, and side of sour cream and Habanero hot sauce(not spicy, nice kick to it)  Churros (2pc) $6.99 It was one of the best churros I had. It was warm and had a side of homemade caramel and chocolate sauce.    Overall I would def come back to try other items on the menu and have the churros again!"}
{"text":"You know what makes me happy? The cheese on nachos. Know what makes me unhappy? When the hot delicious cheese from the hugenormous pile of nachos is stuck to a piece of wax paper. The latter was the case at Mexitaco.  I should say that I got take out, so who knows if this is how it's served in-house but definitely a poor choice for take out purposes.  The 'Nachos Grande' should be the 'Nachos Muy Muy Grande Share Those With 4 Friends' Huge portion, comes with guac and refried beans. Now. The beans were burny tasting (some exploring by digging my finger into the container (don't judge me) found lots of burned bits so that would explain it) which I found depressing. The guac also has lemon in it...I find that odd. Now I know I'm a white girl from NYC...but...lemon? So there's that. I also (stop judging me!) ordered the Arrachera Tacos which were delicious. Good flavor, could use something saucy on there (but I think that's my personal preference).  Way too expensive for the lack of quality/attention to detail so I would probably not go here again."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. You owe a visit here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"There are a lot of burrito shops around but not a whole lot of dine in mexican restaurants like Mexitaco. Having recently coming back from LA and having mexican food that was out of this world. I was quite excited about coming here. I can't say it was on the same level, but a few things were on par.  We ordered quite a lot of stuff off the menu. -Nachos + tinga -Tacos de carne asada -Tacos al pastor -Tacos de pascado asado -Camarones al pastor -Burrito de tinga -Quesadilla de picadilo -Churros -Fried ice cream  Nachos + Tinga Tinga is chipotle chicken. the chicken is pulled. Lots of sauce, not dry at all. That being said, the chips did not get soggy and turn into mush. Solid nachos. The habanero sauce was delicious as well. I'm not a spicy person and I handled it just fine.  Tacos - come in 2. each taco is like a 2 bite taco. you're gonna have to order a few of these. Carne asada - marinated grilled beef, diced onion, cilantro. Beef is cooked all the way through, nicely seasoned, but would have preferred the beef to be cooked to a medium so it was a bit more juicy. Al Pastor - marainated grilled pork, grilled pineapple, diced onion. same thing, lacked a bit of juice, but overall flavourful. pineapple is a nice touch. maybe add cheese for the extra $2? Pescado asado - marinated grilled fish, pico de gallo, cilantro. one word. excellent Camarones al pastor - marinated grilled shrimp, grilled pineapple, diced onion, cilantro. also excellent. shrimp goes along with the pineapple beautifully.  Burrito de tinga again that's chipotle chicken. The burritos are good sized for a meal. Not filled with just rice and has a good portion of chicken and beans.  Quesadilla de picadillo ground beef in tomato stew, cheese. this is also great for sharing. quesdillas are never enough for a meal in my opinion. the cheese was nice and stringy. delicious.  Churros these are made fresh. super crispy on the exterior with a nice soft center. the caramel sauce is amazing. also made in house. i could die for these.  Fried Ice cream choice of vanilla or chocolate. we went with vanilla. also has pecans. I think the pecans were fried. Not sure what else about it could have been.  Overall, excellent. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I like the staff here, and the food is delicious. Cheesy, meaty, cilantro-y heaven.   But, mostly I'm writing this review to explain why my friends and I so often opt for Al Asidor instead, because I feel a vague sense of guilt.   In the summer, mexitaco's patio tips the scales, but the interior lighting is a visual scouring pad.   Realistically, eating is kind of a weird thing to watch, which is part of why restaurants are always nice and dim. Mexitaco only has flourescent lights and it IRKS me. It irks my eyes. I just want to sit around wood and softness and candle light. This is not a freakish preference.   I know I\"m throwing lampshade here but I believe in a better, darker future. Thank you."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstandingly friendly service. My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch. We split a carnitas taco plate. These were possibly tge best carnitas I've ever had. Perfectly roasted and seasoned with cilantro and. I think green onion. The server, who turned out to be one of the owners, Alex, was pleasantly surprised to hear us ask for a tamarindo. Now it was about 2;00 and my husband was having his afternoon chai/Vietnamese coffee craving. No problem. He skipped out to purchase a cup of chai (even borrowed the glass from an Indian restaurant a few doors down and Alex had no problem bringing it in. He chatted about Toronto and wanted to hear where we were visiting from.  That evening our friends arrived and after much deliberating over where to eat on Bloor St,, we found ourselves back at Mexitaco-- and quite happily. Alex's face lit up when he saw us and he introduced us to his mom. There are only 4 tables or so in this restaurant and we were lucky to snag tge last one by the bar. Because they were so good, my husband ordered the carnitas and convinced a friend to do the same. I splurged on the sizzling steak fajitas and they did not disappoint. And our other friend, the birthday girl had the beef burrito and really enjoyed it. The margaritas were good, though I'd recommend only the lime one,  and they have a good selection of tequila and beer . To top it all off, Alex brought around tequila shots for our friend's birthday and then surprised us more with a delicious caramel chocolate cheese stuffed Mexican pastry. This restaurant is a great place and I can't recommend it enough for its great food, excellent and thoughtful service. It really puts a neighbourly  face on a big bustling city."}
{"text":"The menu has a  huge range of authentic-looking Mexican dishes. I don't feel qualified to comment on the authenticity. I will say that the food seemed very different from what's found in typical Tex-Mex style joints (in a good way). The portion to price ratio is rather small. Especially when it comes to the tiny tacos. I had the chorizo tacos. They came with a spoon full of meat, chopped cilantro and onions on each taco, which were about the size of my palm ($8.99). The tacos tasted ok but needed a little kick. The condiments (seasoned onion, salsa verde and salsa) brought to our table took care of that.   Next time, I would consider one of their platters for more variety."}
{"text":"I went there about a week ago with a couple of friends and we decided to share a few dishes. We ordered Quesadillas, Tinga, Enchiladas & Tostadas.   We found all the dishes to be decent but way too blunt in our opinion, they were definitely missing some spices..  Nothing really special about this place..   I will not be going there again.."}
{"text":"Finally made it in here on a rainy winter afternoon.   The food is really authentic. I was the only person in the restaurant so service was good since he didn't have to focus on anything else other than getting ready for the dinner rush. I went with a michelada and the chilaquiles. The michelada was tasty. While I've recently had better chilaquiles in California, this dish was quite good. Very simple and filling and hit the spot."}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews and was looking forward to eating here.  I so wanted to love it.  We had the fajitas for two.  They were just okay.  The portions were a little on the small side for two people.  The taste was okay but I guess my expectations were built up from the previous reviews.  I am also comparing it to the outstanding homemade food I had in Mexico.  A few minutes after eating these, I had a bit of a reaction and couldn't stop coughing.  Normally a bit of spice doesn't bother me but something in these just went down wrong.  Not sure about this place yet and will see what others say as time goes on."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Feels like you're transported to another place with the festive decor and latin music. Happy with the service and owner is friendly. Will definitely be coming back here for my taco cravings."}
{"text":"Tiny place, feels authentic and the food was reasonably priced.  I tried 3 typos of taco, pretty delicious and compared to what you get from Mexico, I'd say they do a fairly good job.  I'd stop by when I'm in the area but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Mexitaco is DEFINITELY the place to go for authentic Mexican food! The restaurant is family owned and offers some seriously delicious food!  - We ordered a mix of burritos, different tacos, coctels, & some drinks!! Everything was freshly made and really flavourful.  - This photo features the camarones al pastor: marinated grilled shrimp, grilled pineapple, onions & cilantro. ($7.99 for two tacos) We really recommend the Baha fish taco!! - Seating area was spacious and we didn't have to wait to be seated as we went during the middle of the day on a Wednesday haha"}
{"text":"Not surprisingly, Mexitaco is a restaurant that is Mexican and serves tacos.  I so wanted to like this place, however, found that the quality of the food really varied between dishes.  Tacos are fantastic here, particularly the El Pastor and the Chorizo.  The coriander is a nice complement.  I also ordered a drink called horchata, which tasted a bit like a watered down eggnog, but was thoroughly refreshing.    My friend ordered a steak, which she liked, but the side of nachos and guacamole was super gross - the nachos were all soggy and deflated.  My other friend ordered a burrito, and the inside was completely cold - he had to get them to reheat it in the microwave.    I didn't try the desserts, but all were a variation on the theme of ice cream, tortillas, and deep frying.    Beyond that, the people are super friendly and attentive (and which is why I want to like it!)  Spartan decor with Mexican talk shows, pop and Reggaeton music videos playing while you are eating (somehow this adds to the air of authenticity).  Come here only for the El Pastor and Chorizo tacos."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite mexican restaurant in toronto, it has a very authentic feel and the service is great. It is a very family frienfly restaurant with amazing food. It can get busy on friday and throughout the weekend but has live music on these days which make it worth the wait"}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I COME HERE I THINK, \"WHY DON'T WE COME HERE MORE OFTEN?\"   This place is an underrated local gem. It's a really warm, comfortable place with genuine Mexican food that's wicked delicious."}
{"text":"Lived in Mexico City for a while...so I know what authentic Mexican food should taste like. Was great to find a authentic Mexican restaurant in the city...had the pastor and quesadillas... followed by a modello...will definitely be back"}
