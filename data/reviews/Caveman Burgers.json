{"text":"I went here yesterday for dinner.  Had a turkey burger with pepperjack cheese, tomatoes and lettuce with a side of sweet potato fries and a small lemonade.  The food was very good---fresh tasting and made to order. However, the bill was $15.00. Kinda pricey for a hamburger and fries. I will probably go back, but not too soon, based on the price."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!  If you are in the mood for a great burger but are short on time, you want to go here. Very friendly and helpful staff and quick service. Our juicy burgers were delivered to our table in five minutes. We ordered fries and ranch dressing for dipping too. The ranch is homemade and very good, although very salty (made sure to drink extra water the rest of the day). They offer grass fed and vegetarian burgers too. We also enjoyed the atmosphere; a rustic style restaurant with plenty of room to hang out and a nice patio. Needless to say we are excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Great burger place, chipotle style menu. Good quality burgers you can customize your way. Extra cost for some add-ons but worth it. Reasonable prices. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A good burger and bun, yes....but unfortunately there are LOTS of those around a city like Phoenix.  The prices are so high that we can't afford it for two of us, so we won't be going back.  What difference does grass-fed or angus beef make if you aren't eating it EVERY day!?  We eat healthily, but to pay $30 for two for a hamburger meal is absurd."}
{"text":"It can be extremely difficult to eat out when you follow a Paleo lifestyle, even more so when people you're with don't.... Until eating at caveman burger! I was so pleasantly surprised that we could all find a delicious meal! Amazing quality meat, fresh toppings and delicious sides, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and good customer service!! Had the veggie burger and fries...the patty was delicious! Manager checked on us and was kind. They have a punch card. Worth going!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews for this place on yelp so my husband and I decided to check it out since moving in the area. We both got the grass fed burgers, my husband got the garlic fries and I got the sweet potato fries. The burgers were cooked just right and juicy. We both agreed the these burgers were far superior to 5 Guy's burgers. I liked the sweet potato fries but the garlic parmesan fries were amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a delicious treat! Grass feed angus beef on a pretzel bun- yes please! My son ordered a salmon burger and loved it. The sweet potato fries are amazing."}
{"text":"Liked it a ton and will go back!! Was impressed they cooked it to the temperature I asked for and the fresh baked bun was yummy and light. Fries were amazing.... fresh and super hot, also cooked perfectly. The staff was super friendly and had good energy. Thumbs up for me!!"}
{"text":"I went there today for the very first time. Ordered the Turkey burger and absolutely loved the taste. I like that they give you an option  to just have your burger on a salad. They use high quality meats and you can taste it. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Unique style - every burger is custom. Burgers are pretty big! Great taste. Onion rings are some of the best I've ever had. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"After WEEKS of wanting to come here, tonight we finally did after all the hype we have been hearing. We ordered and our food was brought out to us to-go in a timely manner. We drove home and opened our burgers. I had ordered a mushroom and Swiss burger with raw onion which we were also charged the extra charge for the add one. But sadly, what I got was a burger with only a little Swiss cheese and onions. Not only was I missing what I was charged for, this burger did not look appealing either. I drove back immediately and they were happy to refund me my money, which was nice. Although this first experience was not the best, I would like to try them out again. Hope next time is better."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn, because I loved the bun, the toppings and the freaking onion rings at Caveman burgers. Like, a lot. What I didn't love was the meat. It just tasted a little off to me. I'll try it again and see if I was having a weird meat day, or if this burger really is slightly askew.   But seriously. The onion rings. Holy cow."}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is the best burger I've ever had. The pretzel bun is to die for. I added bacon, grilled onions and American cheese. The party is cooked to absolute mouthwatering perfection. The owner or manager was present and working alongside the employees. All were super nice. The restaurant is an order at the counter style. Lots of mix and match options. Super clean, beautiful interior yet non pretentious. . We will be back again and again. And the Parmesan and garlic seasoned fries are amazing. I died and went to burger heaven."}
{"text":"Good quality food, nice place, friendly staff.   Opportunities: I like the build your own concept, but for a gourmet burger with a gourmet price tag, I'd like some options that have been put together by a chef as opposed to me randomly picking toppings. I don't mind paying 10-15 bucks a burger, but it should be a gourmet creation in my opinion (Zinburger, PV Burgers, etc). As a build your own, I see no reason to pay the added cost versus going to a 5 Guys or Lennys.  Simply put, cost/value makes it a 3 star."}
{"text":"It's good but my fries came out late and they seemed to be wet for some reason I even had to dry them off with paper towel  ! Zinburger 100% takes tha cake for best burger but this place ok for second pick"}
{"text":"The burger was ok, I'm not crazy for it.. I've had better, but it's still a new place and maybe with time it will get better, the employees had a good attitude and the place was clean, I might give it another try in time just to see if it's the same or not."}
{"text":"We recently moved near this area and I dined in with my mother and sister. And our first time here was exceptional!! You can craft your own burger with the toppings of your choice. It was pricy but definitely worth it.   Food was super delicious and the service was beyond outstanding. I tried one of the sauces that they have, it was the chipotle ranch lime. It went perfectly with my angus beef burger! I went back to the counter and asked if I could have a bit more on the side, and the a nice girl and a guy in the back kindly recommended that I try the salmon burger next time with the same sauce. They said it paired up so well.So now I have the perfect excuse to come back and try their salmon burger!   Everyone at the counter was so friendly! I believe it was the manager who kept walking around and asking how our food was. He was very polite and thanked us kindly when we told him it was our first time eating there. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New place, very tasty burger and good fries, well worth it and will be back. #cavemanburgers.  Local spot that should get busier over time. Don't pass it by."}
{"text":"This place is great! Where can you find grass fed, local burgers that have not been frozen? Tastes fantastic and great service. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Decided to try CMB tonight and now I am hooked! I think it was the owner who helped us this evening and he was very helpful and friendly. You choose your protein and what you want on it. The wait was not long and the burger was delicious! The fries, which you order separately, were just right - not soggy but not burned. What made the experience even better was their Gluten free menu. Gluten free buns from a bakery in Colorado are available (for an extra $2) and the sauce was GF as well. I am celiac and very sensitive to cross contamination. After finishing everything on my plate, I went home feeling happy and satisfied. The best part was that I did not get sick so the meal truly was GF!!! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We read about this place online and have been trying to get over there to give it a try. TOTALLY worth the little drive. My husband had the angus on a pretzel bun, bacon, jalapeno, cheese, and egg. The pretzel bun was soft and doughy and chewy and amazing. I had the angus on a traditional bun, bacon, avocado, cheddar, CMB sauce. I regret not getting an egg and putting it on the pretzel bun. However, the traditional bun was amazing. Toasted perfectly. Husband had fries with CMB seasoning delicious. I had onion ring with CMB dipping sauce. The onion rings literally melted in my mouth.  It was definitely a bit more expensive than we expected, $35 for 2 burgers, 1 fries, 1 onion ring, & 2 drinks. But that will not deter us from coming back.  The service was ridiculously fast. The place was full and there were about 10 people in front of us. I think we waited on food maybe 10-15 minutes. We both commented it was fast. The gentleman who brought us our food was very nice. I don't know if he was the owner or not, but if he wasn't, the owners should be proud that he treats their company so well.  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, but too much bun and the bun does not taste fresh. The fries are too expensive for the little portion. Sweet potato fries are soggy and the onion rings are extremely expensive for the small portion. Thankfully I had a free coupon for fries.  It is nice that they have grass fed beef and high quality toppings."}
{"text":"Wow ! We loved this place. Walking in we were greeted and it was clean. They explained the menu and even help with options. My husband got an angus burger on a pretzel bun with lime cilantro fries. He said it was great. The fries have a lime infused oil and fresh cilantro. He ordered a dry bun with lettuce /tomatoes grilled mushroom & Swiss and said the meat was done perfectly. I ordered an Angus burger lettuce/tomato & spicy peppers on a gluten free bun and was told the buns are flown in from a bakery out if state . The meat was cooked medium and the bun was moist unlike most gf buns! I had sweet potato fries and a side of creamy chipotle  lime sauce, I could have just had that for my dinner, it was fantastic. Their burgers are big juicy and tasty cooked just right. They even came out to ask us if every thing was cooked ok. Bathrooms were clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Fries didn't come out til I had already ate my burger. Manager said the cool forgot to make the fries. Then a couple were cold inside, I'm guessing he tried to rush them out after the mess up. The manager offered no kind of compensation for the mess up. The atmosphere is kind of bland. Could use a tv for a ball game or more decor?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  2 cheeseburgers 2 fries $20.   Saltless fries,  burgers cooked to leather quality, oh and lets not forget when I made it home and opened the burgers up the cheese was missing.  Youll get better, juicier burger, well seasoned fries from village inn out front of this establishment."}
{"text":"With high hopes and expectations based on other reviews my experience here was nothing anyone else's. Possibly with this being a newly opened place I should have lowered my expectations.  When walking in we were passed by an employee who looked like skrillex and was not greeted by him. Who also ended up being our cashier. He did not know how to ring anything in and needed help the whole time this making our ordering process take an eternity. He took my order and thought we were done ordering while my wife who standing next to me has yet to order. He didn't speak loud enough to even hear him repeat our order. I ordered a large drink and he handed me a small cup when there is obviously two sizes cups in front of us.  After waiting for a very long time for our order our food shows up separate! The same cashier brought our food and didn't know who's it was or what it was. He then brings out my wife's order awhile later and it's wrong. They take it back to just sprinkle the correct topping for the fries. The cheese was not melted and you can tell it was a fast fix. The burgers were over cooked and fell apart. Not worth the wait or money for this type of service and over cooked under seasoned food.  We will not be returning and I wish we would have went to five guys instead. If I could put negative stars I would have."}
{"text":"Great Turkey burger, great atmosphere, and awesome service. Best Turkey Burger I've found love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My first and last time the burger was pricey but very average. The fries were horrible they tasted like old potatoes."}
{"text":"So good.  Loved it all.  Couldn't get a call in once to get pick up, but husband went in and it was quick.  I recommend the fries with the cilantro lime:)"}
{"text":"Super yummy burgers and fries! We had both sweet potato fries and regular fries loved them both. Meat and buns were fresh and wonderful .  Great to shop and eat local !"}
{"text":"yummy!! Ordered to go and was not disappointed when I opened up the bag and saw my food. Only suggestion to Caveman burgers is get hotter green chili  other than that no complaints. Staff was nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Killer onion rings. Wish they had draft beer instead of cans but I can't even complain. The onion rings are genuinely awesome, super fresh, onion doesn't fly out with the first bite, just super great."}
{"text":"We tried Caveman for the first time today, and we are hooked! Wow, the grass fed beef burger was so juicy and flavorful! The toppings were generous, too. Ordered fries, and although good, I was too full to eat them. As others have noted, it's a pricier burger compared to others, but I think the quality warrants it. It is a real treat, and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"First Time in tonight. I was going to take a picture but I couldn't stop eating it. My bad. Service was great, food was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We live in the area and finally tried it out. 1. Build your own burger so as you move through the process the price adds up. 2. Lots of choices to choose from to build your burger from the beef, condiments, and add ons like bacon, fried egg, etc.  Add on sauces were a cost though...like BBQ or Ranch.  Also dipping sauces for fries were extra. 3. Place is clean and staff made sure to quickly clean tables and high chairs after use.  Bathrooms were clean too.  And yes Yelp - they were gender neutral/single use bathrooms... 4. Food was good and fresh with my only complaint that bun was a little doughy and too big for the contents.  I had about 1/3 of a bun left at the end. 5. The place was too hot - granted it was 114 degrees outside but either their a/c equipment is lacking or they are trying to save some money and keeping it around 80 in there. 6. They have Coke products which is a must for us 7. The staff was friendly and attentive.  Will I go here again? Sure if someone else wants to go.  Will I pick this place when wanting a burger and tell everyone that you have to go here?  Meh...they deserve better than 2 stars but this place doesn't breach my top 10 burger places in Phoenix but that is a tough list to crack."}
{"text":"Don't pass this one by! While it is situated in a typical shopping mall that's where typical ends. We were greeted by friendly employees who explained how we could customize our burger. My husband was thrilled to see they had fried duck eggs(when seasonally available). We both loved our grass fed beef burgers! My gluten free bun was super tasty. The fries were so good too. The decor is great with rustic booths and community style seating. Your meal comes on a tin plate. The chef there was awesome! He came out to see how we liked everything. Thank you for an amazing meal Kalin(hope I spelled that right!) and top notch service!! We will be return costumers for sure."}
{"text":"This is gonna be the next big thing.  In a health conscious society this is what we need.  The burgers are grass fed beef and you can taste the goodness.  The duck egg is like gold on top of your burger.  Go here now"}
{"text":"First visit and it was awesome. You can make your own custom burger...choose the protein, bread/salad/lettuce wrap, and toppings!! The patties were perfect- not overcooked at all and the buns (I'm picky) were rrreeeaaal good. Got an American beef patty with pepper jack cheese and green onions, will def return to try the salmon & fill up on sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"We LOVED this place. A little pricey but worth it. Get the pretzel bun and siracha ketchup. Phenomenal burger. Extremely clean...highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food, ok service, good location. I hate to complain about having too many options, but I went with two friends and it took us 10 minutes to order even with no line because we couldn't decide what we wanted. We talked out loud about it and I could feel the awkwardness from the cashier, but even when we asked for suggestions she just said \"everything is great\". Wow, really? I was under the impression that everything was awful here... that is the worse response you can get at a restaurant unless it is the obligatory intro to what they actually recommend.  I'm not the most decisive person I know, but I love food so I normally don't have a problem ordering it. There are a couple suggestions on the menu, but they are so plain that they weren't appealing. I ended up going with a pretty plain burger any ways (patty, lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and one of their specialty sauces), but I was so distracted by the choices that I forgot to get cheese. What is a burger without cheese?? It's still a burger (I know!), but I have never forgotten cheese in my life- my profile is pretty much dedicated to my love affair with cheese in case you aren't understanding how upsetting this was for me. But, I digress. It took about 20 minutes to get my burger and another 10 minutes to get the sauce I had ordered with that burger (you know, when I forgot to order my cheese... I'm still not over it).   There were 7 people other than us in the restaurant so it wasn't busy, but they could have fooled me with how long it took to get our food. When we got the food it was pretty good and I'd put it in my top 10 burgers places in AZ, but I only know of like 5 burger spots other than fast food and large chain burger joints so that really doesn't say all that much. I'd say that it is worth a try and if you are going on a trip across AZ to find the best burger places I wouldn't cross this off your to go list, but I also wouldn't put it on your bucket list.  Side note: the décor is pretty cool, but the chairs are super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited so long to try this place. Mostly because I'm really not a Burger person, not that I don't like them more that I hate paying for something I can easily put together myself.  But this place is worth it. Everything thing we had was on point and delicious. Best sweet potato fries I've ever had at a restaurant. Homemade ranch was the bomb. Burgers were super fresh and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Was upset when I ordered takeout and they forgot to put the egg on. I paid extra for a fried egg and they didn't even add it. I didn't look until I got home, but very bitter. Also I got the garlic cheese fries...it was not worth the extra money, more like a seasoning. I thought it would be minced garlic not just garlic salt. I could've done that at my own home. Expected a lot more from the place. The burger itself was big which was nice and was pretty good, but not for all the extra cost, especially when they don't put everything. The lady at the front was nice though."}
{"text":"Super yummy burgers. Amazing variety.  My girlfriend and I had the beer battered onion rings and they were some of the best we've had, even though they're a little pricey for the amount of rings.  Build-your-own burger, like we did, or choose from one of the specialty burgers, complete with catchy names.  The menu on the website only shows the burger component options. A little expensive, however it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Customer service is great. Recommend this place to lift your spirits. Very clean and food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Good food, freshly prepared, really friendly staff! Tried the Savory-Toothed Burger, but was not brave enough to try it with peanut butter. Will have to return to do that!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. Not sure why you would recommend you burgers being cooked medium well lol only if I want a nasty over cooked burger. Fries are extra and are pretty good. Very limited beer selection.  Probably won't be back with a Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers close. Way better beer selection and better burgers."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Seems a few places are going to this style of walking to the counter, ordering and the food coming to you.  When we walked in someone thankfully was near the door to direct us to the counter.  We looked at the menu online so we didn't have to stand at the counter long to decide. This might make for a longer wait when it's busy because you have several choices to make to complete your order. The order taker was friendly and asked questions to make sure we ordered everything we wanted (cheese, type of bun, additional items).  I got the black and white bean burger on a regular bun. No cheese but mayo, mustard, onion, lettuce and tomato. It was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. You can literally see the whole black beans and the seasonings were tasty. But don't expect it to taste like meat, it tastes like beans but very delicious.  The other two in our party ordered the grass fed beef and both said they were excellent tasting. They also both had an egg on it and mentioned the seasoning used on the egg was tasty. They weren't expecting it so next time the condiments (mayo, etc.) may be reduced because the egg tasted so good by itself.  The French fries were crispy and hot. Meals are made to order so everything comes to the table warm.  If you sign up for their club you get 20% off your order. It's a little pricey, with our discount and a free French fry we were at $36 for three people (3 drinks along with our meals). But the taste and freshness make it ok for the price.  When I come again, which I'm sure I will, I'd get the black bean burger with the lettuce wrap instead of the bun.  That's a personal issue though, nothing against the soft, slightly grilled bun.  They are located in a strip mall type location so there's plenty of parking but most of it is not near the door, but not bad.  Not sure if they ever get extremely busy but it seems there are plenty of tables inside and some outside as well.    Nice, casual atmosphere and friendly staff woukd make this a place to come again and again."}
{"text":"Tried it on a whim one day and was not disappointed.  It was a little more than I like to spend but the quality of the food was great.  We ate at the location and it looked nice, it was clean.  They were very nice while taking our order and someone came and checked with us while we were eating to make sure everything was good.  We got an order of their sweet potato fries with the pecan dipping sauce, and it was surprisingly good for someone who doesn't normally like sweet foods.  I would recommend them if you want a good burger, just be prepared to spend a little more."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch since we were in the area. Honestly I can say that this was one of the best burgers I've had. Although it was a bit pricey. We paid almost $40 for 2 cheeseburgers (we made our own burgers with a couple toppings and pretzel buns which added up quickly), 1 sweet potato fries, as well as cheese and garlic fries, and 1 large drink. While we were thrown off with the price at the end we'll be returning whenever we're in the area. We recommended the place to close friends. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Caveman Burgers is a fun little spot, sort of tucked away off of Bell Rd. Small-ish and cozy with a good patio area, especially nice in milder weather. One nice thing is that this is not a chain restaurant but one of a kind. Using locally sourced, I believe, Angus beef and grass-fed beef, Caveman Burgers gives you a plethora of choices for your toppings, as well as several bun choices. I'm a fan of the pretzel bun. Ordering is done at the counter, choose all your toppings, etc. and grab a seat.  Burgers are generously-sized and I thought quite tasty. I had the fries on the side, but there is available a giant sized onion ring item on the menu that might bear investigation next time I visit.   The staff was friendly, helpful and very informative. The space is very casual and laid back. Prices may seem a bit steep for burgers but frankly I didn't think it was too over the top. Caveman Burgers is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. And, as it's a local business, I'm all in favor of giving it a shout out. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My first visit today was amazing....especially since I've gone plant based/ vegan. This place has and awesome black and white beam burger encrusted in panko. It's flavorful, holds together and not dry! They will be on my lunch rotation here on out. A+ customer service too!"}
{"text":"So, this place is amazing! Dozens of sauces to pick from and the homemade sauces are fantastic. Met the owner. Really nice guy and helped give suggestions.   Yes, the price is higher than most places but the food is local (grass fed beef from AZ) and even their hot ghost pepper sauce is made from a local resident. This place is worth it for a simple date night!  Love this place and will be back"}
{"text":"Fresh. Clean. Deeeeelicious. I don't love the paper wrapper under the burger- it gets all soggy! Also didn't get napkins with our burgers and they were kinda messy, since we got all the fixins. Love the peppercorn sauce. And the turkey burger."}
{"text":"Good burger! I got it as take out. You order your outer part, then your protein, then your condiments and veggies. I ordered a regular bun with natural angus beef, mustard, green chiles, lettuce, tomato and pickles. I added cheese and grilled onion for extra charge. Fries are a la carte here but I got the regular fries. (Thanks Yelp check in!) I could have substituted for onion rings or sweet potato fries (next time). The bun was good!! It was substantial and didn't break apart, yet it was fluffy and tasty! The meat tasted good. You definitely could taste the organic meat because it just adds something to the meat flavor. It was a juicy piece of meat too, but it didn't taste greasy. I liked my combo of veggies and condiments. Just a warning, the grilled onions aren't rings, but larger cut pieces.  I would definitely come back here. No vegetarian options on the menu but a turkey burger was available for the healthier folks along with a salad or lettuce wrap option."}
{"text":"Really good turkey burgers and Attentive staff fries are a little on the dry side. Their special sauce is awesome too ! Great gluten free and paleo options"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times (including dinner last night) and will definitely be back soon!  Fresh burgers made to order - lots of themed offerings but also many cheeses, veggies, sauces and sides to make it your own - vegan and gluten-free options, friendly counter service, excellent fresh-cut fries!  Nice post-industrial atmosphere, nice shaded patio, good ambient music, but not too loud so you can actually have a relaxed conversation.  A little pricey, but a good value if you join \"The Club\" (Get it?  Caveman ... Club ... ok, whatever ...); you'll get 20% coupons regularly via email.  If you like a beer with your burger, they've got you covered several ways.  It's tucked away in a strip center next to Jimmy John's back aways from Bell Rd., but worth the search.  Even a Caveman can do it!"}
{"text":"Expensive burgers. My turkey burger fell apart after 1st bite...soggy & wasn't that tasty. Husband ordered a beef burger, was crisp & under cooked. Our fries were uncooked as well. 2nd day of opening & they ran out of onion rings & sweet potato fries...not really the wow factor. I'd rather spend $28 for 2 people at Fuddruckers for a buffalo burger & plenty of fries plus drink. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is fantastic.  Best of all, owner grew up in the area so let's do our part and support him as a friend, family and local business owner."}
{"text":"10.00 for a burger, and they wanna charge 2.00 extra for a pretzel bun? Hahaha. It was good, but not 10.00 good, especially in this neighborhood?  Please, you are in a grocery store strip mall"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple months ago. Burger was great but customer service not so...found the guy behind the counter taking orders unfriendly. There was a charge for some sauces so we didn't try them...pay of sauces???  We were the only people in the place and the music was so loud it was difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Fresh cut French fries or sweet potato fries. Cage free turkey, Angus and Arizona grass feed beef. All the topping are here to create a tasty burger an enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Price is high. Burgers are good.  Fries were below average. Would for sure come again."}
{"text":"Best burger in North Phoenix.  Service was kind and friendly.  \"Topping Tuesday\" may just replace \"Taco Tuesday\" from here on out.  Kinda hidden...worth the find."}
{"text":"Good burgers, fries and rings.  A little pricey i thought but not horrible.  The patio seating is nice and the large fountain provides good background noise.   Overall i liked this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"The truth is, it's a high priced burger shop. You pay extra for each item you put on the average burger. It could be a great concept if it were not overpriced. 23.00 for two just ok burgers at lunch is not a place we will return to"}
{"text":"First time here. Their menu is definitely small but from what I had it was pretty good. A little pricey but the burger was pretty good. I might have to try it again."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Love the concrete floors, rustic feel and tall wooden tables.  Burgers are great and the burger to bun ratio was spot on.  Its a relatively limited menu (good thing) so hopefully the quality / consistency remains solid.  Only knock on it was the fact its cafeteria style rather than sit down.  There are very few quality restaurants in that area and if it wasn't cafeteria style I would go there more often.  Will try again in another month and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Cheap beers before 6pm.  Great burgers also. My wife ordered the matador, 3 patties, fired egg, the works.  Staff was very friendly, fires were fresh as well.  Our 2 year old got a grilled cheese sandwich and fries, she enjoyed.    This place is good and a lot like 5 guys but with more customizeable options."}
{"text":"Had an Arizona raised beef burger and fries. Yummy and fresh. 4 stars only because the green chili was canned and not fresh so it was not as flavorful as it could have been (to match up to the rest of the burger and other toppings.  I only have water when I eat out so I really appreciate when the water is filtered and fresh tasting....as it is here. So I thank them for that!! The place was clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. They also walked the dining area checking on the customers needs and satisfaction. They promptly took the used dishes away. Great service!! It was also nice and cool inside. It is getting hot out....ok it IS hot out and nothing worse then going in to a place to eat and it is hot inside as well. So it was nice and comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Not just another burger place! Excellent burger and awesome service.  Customization options are unbelievable- they even have diced green chile as a free add on!  You can make your burger exactly how you want it and there are so many options, you can try something new every time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Burgers are real real good. Fries are delicious. Staff was super friendly. Kind of expensive for a family. But superb to say the least"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time.  The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was delicious.    We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best burgers we've ever had. The place is clean, food is amazing and the service was spot on. We will definitely be returning with friends and family in tow."}
{"text":"I love everything about the food at Caveman Burgers. Great taste and fast service. The only complaint I have is that frequently when I call to place an order, their phone doesn't always work. Sometimes it goes directly to a message that this number is not taking calls... :("}
{"text":"Had to come back because the food is awesome.    On our first visit, Amanda was very helpful building the perfect hamburger and sides for me.  Jeff was super nice and both checked on us often while we ate both times we have been here.    This last trip, I had gone back up to the register and was waiting for a straw to get cut in half (grand-daughter was with me and had to have a short straw which they accommodated!) when the staff in the back noticed me standing there.   They went out of their way to make sure I had been taken care of.   Great atmosphere and very clean tables.   The bathroom was super clean as well."}
{"text":"The hamburgers here are absolutely amazing. This place has a walk up counter to order at, but the servers bring your food out to you once you sit down. If you go, get an awesome burger, but skip on the fries. We got regular and sweet potato fries and neither ones were worth eating. I have a hard time letting French fries go to waste but it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered this through UberEATS. My god. This was the best burger I've had in years. Absolutely beautiful. I'm talking premium patty, perfect bun, cheddar cheese just melting into the bacon and grass fed beef. And the fries?   I recommend this place 1,000x over.  UPDATE: May 27, 2017.  I still think about the burger I got from this place. This burger is officially the burger of my dreams. I currently live in Los Angeles and am legitimately trying to think of a way to eat this burger again as soon as possible.   UPDATE: August 3, 2017  The burger I ate here encourages me to continue eating burgers in the hopes that their exquisite taste will be replicated in the burgers I have access to. The memory has propelled me forward, yet I've encountered none like it. Why is your deliciousness so far from me?"}
{"text":"Just ok.   Nice selection of topping.   Fries were soggy, bun tasted as if it was a few days old.  Beer served from a can and plastic cup."}
{"text":"So I decided to stop by this place with a coworker. Saw all the reviews and figured why not .. it's got a good amount of positive comments and man I have not had a better burger . I love the way the menu is set up . The girl at the register ( Joanne I believe) was more than accommodating to tell me and my coworker how the menu worked. She was concise with the different sauces and how they were and what went good with what .. We got our order and sat down on the patio which was inviting. Joanne came out 10 minutes later with our order,  I had the onion rings which were phenomenally fresh and crispy ( and seemingly double dipped ) with a little spice on them . For the burger I had the Arizona grass fed burger with the pretzel bun , a fried duck egg ( yes really) bacon , mushrooms & their CMB sauce . It was terrific. Before we were done the manager ( or maybe the owner) came out and asked how we liked everything of course no complaints at all from either of us . Just as a mention For those who want a gluten free bun that's available.. vegan burgers .. angus burger.. they pretty much have anything you can put on one . It was so good that I took my roommate here 3 days later hence me writing the review:)  go check them out.. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place. Burger was phenomenal, turkey burger was good (didn't blow my socks off but I have never had one that has.) the fries are crazy delicious! Our onion rings took longer then expected d/t a mix up in the kitchen (we didn't say anything) and when they brought them out they refunded our money, which wasn't at all necessary So we left it as a tip, which was well deserved. Super friendly staff & great service. Hopefully they keep that up. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of few places with duck eggs. You can personalize you burger and staff still have smiles. I wish fries were better. I found them hard."}
{"text":"Burgers are very tasty! The service is great everyone is smiling and very attentive. We got the AZ grass fed and one Angus burger with regular fries and an order of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries are very good not soggy like other places they are done to perfection.The burger was a little big but it's better than over paying for a small one. At first I thought it was a bit over priced but once I saw the size I felt it it was justified. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place ! We ordered through Uber eats and wanted to change our order and they totally went above and beyond ! Thank you Lexi !  Such good quality of food ! Can't wait to order again this weekend !"}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing. The pretzel buns were so delicious and the habanero ketchup is the perfect sauce for burgers. Also the onion rings were the best ive ever had!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch and dinner. The staff is very friendly and ready to help! I have gotten the white and black bean burger and grass fed burger here. Both delicious depending on what mood you're in that day. Get the fresh cut fries with CMB seasoning!"}
{"text":"This was another great place for burgers . Great food and atmosphere. Great staff . Do need to have a few domestic beers like bud light etc. but was great otherwise. Will be going back"}
{"text":"Their intent appears there.  The name and the resteraunt looked cool.  However my angus burger with a fresh bun and an order of onion rings totaled 14.00.  Nothing really special. No flame broiled burger, no specially grilled bun with awesome seasoning etc.   I was thinking must be tasty .  But just a plane old boring burger. So a bit pricy.  They need to invite feedback? Via a comments card etc. Ask what patrons would like at Caveman Burgers."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. The burger was really good. It more expensive than the McBurger across the parking lot, but this is also a much better experience. I'll definitely return. I think it's a good value for you money."}
{"text":"Mandy and the staff were so great, very friendly and happy to make delicious recommendations to us as we were \"first timers\"!!! I went with my husband and son and we all absolutely loved it...best burger in town and tastes amazing!!! I had the Angus burger with my choice of fresh baked buns and local fresh toppings...out of this world delicious. If you haven't visited Caveman... you're missing out, get in and visit the owner and the staff... treat you're taste buds!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, fast and friendly service, and I really like that they give you a gluten-free bun option. My friend and fellow yelper Deb M. recommended this place so I went to try them out, even though it was a bit of a drive for me. I was definitely not disappointed. I ordered the Angus burger topped with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and onion rings , and a side of fries. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked and I really recommend having onion rings as a topping - it's a great way to gild the lily. I need a burger fix pretty often so this one is on my list for when I'm in the north Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The food here was good - a bit greasy, but you get a lot of it!  The fun part about visiting here is how you order - they have so many choices, and the cashier walked us through the process because there were so many choices!  Our burgers were huge and sloppy and really good. Super fun to take the family - like I said, a bit greasy.  Overall recommend."}
{"text":"When they opened I thought it was the greatest burger I've ever eaten. The last time I went it either lost its luster or went down a little. Having said that, it's still very good."}
{"text":"Nothing special to see here. I had high hopes but tastes like any other generic burger that you could get priced at way less. Two burgers, two fries and a large drink for $28? Definitely overpriced and they charge you if you want seasoning on your French fries, something I've never heard of. Won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on ubereats. It was delicious! We had the angus burger.  It was cooked perfectly and went great with the sweet potato fries. Can't wait to see this place in person soon and try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good burgers great service well worth the extra couple bucks, me and my daughter we're very happy and satisfied"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled across this place on our way home. It was a great choice! We both enjoy our meals! I loved the inside! The customer service was awesome ! It has cute little hand painted cave mans on the wall. You get to build your own burger which is actually pretty cool! The total of our meal was $28.19 which wasn't bad. It only took about 10 minutes for our food to come out and it sure was tasty! Highly recommend Caveman Burgers!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger, but there are better options for the price (around $12 for a burger, fries, and drink). Their sides are overpriced considering portion size. Burgers and toppings were tasty, but some of the \"premium\" add-on's (grilled mushrooms, onions) are free at places like five guys. One of our orders was wrong, but was promptly fixed. The staff is friendly and they do offer local craft beer choices."}
{"text":"The burger was good and the fries were tasty without being greasy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Would have given 5 stars except the prices are a bit high for what you get. If you find a Groupon or other discount you should give them a try."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries.  We didn't care for our onion rings and they brought us replacement fries at no charge.  Outstanding customer service.  Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"So I tried Caveman's for the first time today. I ordered over the phone & when I went in to pick up my order the chef came out the kitchen like \"MANI? YOU GO MANI. HERE'S YOUR LUNCH GIRL.\" & I'm like damn a burger & a confidence boost? OKAY. & my food was ready right when I arrived &  hella good. Only 4 stars cause they forgot my lettuce... I need my lettuce.   Update: I went back & they made sure I had my lettuce"}
{"text":"Good place to get a good burger. Flame broiled and not cooked to death (and not smashed, so it doesn't fall apart in your hands!) I got mine with pepper jack and green chiles. The fries could use a bit more seasoning. Better than some of the 'upscale' burgers that cost more"}
{"text":"Out-of-towners coming to relocate and wanted to find a local place and not a chain and this place is fantastic! Looking for a great burger able to build it ourselves and they actually provided table service for us as we were enjoying our burger on the patio outside. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another amazing burger joint! I've been to most if not all the burger spots, this is my go to every time. The burger is worth spending a little extra on, and the sauces are to die for. I recommend the creamy peppercorn ranch! Fries are homemade and come in a variety of seasonings. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Excellent Burgers! A must try Grass Fed beef. We had the Angus, Grass Fed and Wild Salmon burgers.  The beer battered onions are the best!"}
{"text":"First time here...the young man at the counter was very nice, but distracted. It was clean inside, and the service was good. I should have stated I wanted my burger medium rare. All of our burgers were well done, which made them dry...however, they were flavorful. Then, they mixed up the toppings on our burgers. I ordered grass fed and got some toppings my daughter ordered. She ordered angus. I received the angus with some of my toppings and some of hers, and she got my grass fed. It was very dry, and I didn't realize I had the wrong burger until I was almost done. After spending $40 on two burgers...(most toppings are extra) I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place and finally decided to stop in for a late lunch. There was hardly anyone there but it was late for lunch so it's understandable. You order at the counter here and build your own burger by picking the meat, bread, toppings, cheese, sauces, etc.. the price can add up quickly but you get exactly what you want. Three burgers with fries and soda's cost us $41.00. They give you one of those \"coaster\" type things to let you know when your order is ready but someone just brought our order out when it was ready.   The burgers were huge, moist and delicious. They asked if we wanted medium well but they were all closer to medium rare. I had the CMB sauce on mine which was sweet, savory, and pretty good. There was a lot of sauce so it was a bit messy. They were little heavy on the ketchup and mustard on my sons burger which created a mess as well. The fries were the star of the meal. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The atmosphere here is cool. I liked the rustic decor. It was also super clean. They have booths, tables, a tall community table and they also offer outdoor seating. The service was Excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I got home with my order and they completely messed it up. They took FOREVER to prepare it. I'm never going back here. When I called to ask for a refund they said no and they were extremely unprofessional. Never going back again..."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! Burger was top notch, staff was super nice and helpful and the atmosphere was nice"}
{"text":"This place is honestly like a hidden jem! It took me a second to find it but I really enjoyed eating here! We went round lunch time! It wasn't as busy as I was expecting burning lunch time! I'm happy it wasn't! The man that took our orders name was Jeff! Turns out he is the owner as well! I love seeing and owner that works on his actual business shows character he was so kind and gave a great vibe! It was our first time here and he was very informative on the menus and how it works! We both got the Lucy burger meal with a few changes! Although the price is a little high it's still well worth it! The food came out fast and Jeff brought it right to us! Oh my goodness the fries are so good great flavor and perfectly cooked! I liked the burger a lot too it's definitely enough food to share we will be splitting it next time we come in! I definitely recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Got the Angus burger. Was not bad nothing special. My fries were ok didn't really seem to be cooked through. The guy working the counter stared at me when i walked up, my first time so didn't know the layout or procedure for ordering. I thought it funny that a family refilled their drinks as they left and this counter guy stared at them. Stared at me too when i went to get a refill. Didn't see any signs prohibiting refills. Was an uncomfortable feeling. Need more of a people person working the counter. Not used to paying over $12.00 for a burger fries and regular size drink for one person."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the French fries and the creamy peppercorn sauce that I picked.  Burger was good, you can pick whatever you want on it and there are $11 lunch specials that come with a specialty burger, fries and a drink."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was great. They were very helpful in helping me figure out what the best burger would be for me. My only issue was the pricing. It was a bit too expensive."}
{"text":"got a burger with cheese, fried egg, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, mayo, mustard and an order of fries. some other reviewer said it was salty and indeed it was a little but i love salty!!! fries were on point, burger was perfectly cooked but it was a solid burger. will come again!"}
{"text":"This is a little local pound burger restaurant that did not disappoint, it's located on 7th Street and Bell. You choose your style of burger then you choose your cheese topping sauces. Lots and lots of options. The burger itself was the star of the show as it should be cooked well, good quality. Cute atmosphere and very clean! Sides are good too - I had sweet potato fries - yummo!"}
{"text":"There was 6 of us tonight for the first time. It was really good food! Clean and great service. We met Jeff the owner, really nice guy! We all definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered a single patty burger with bacon, cheddar and a fried egg. Regular bun.  Place wasn't to busy, sat afternoon ish. Food came out in a good time. Was good, not great.  Drawback being, 10$ for a burger, it better be a out of the park homerun. Bun was fresh and nicely toasted. Fries were freshly cut and lightly seasoned. On par with five guys.  Would come back if I happened to drive by. Tbh much prefer 5 guys"}
{"text":"3 out of 4 burgers were still raw. We took it to go otherwise would have sent it back. Not trusting to try again.  Update: we got food poisoning that evening."}
{"text":"Good food great service. Even catered to gluten sensitivity. They made our burgers with a lettuce wrap. They also provided for good selection of options with the food."}
{"text":"BEST ONION RINGS EVER.  Also great sweet potatoes fries and grass fed burger. Excellently seasoned. Though a little over priced. Still worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I wasn't sure what to expect but will say this burger was awesome! The fries were hand cut freshly made! I am definitely coming back! This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, fries, and onion rings and great service! Our first time here but definitely not our last. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible!!! Definitely will be back to build my own burger. My only small complaint is the temperature of the fries. They were all room temperature on the cusp of Luke-warm. This was the case my fries and all of my friends fries as well. However, a great place and a must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent yummy burgers. Made them exactly how we ordered them. So juicy and the fries were excellent! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try caveman burgers. Try it--you won't be sorry! It is a tad spendy, but the food is delicious and great quality. I do not each much beef--so I went with the turkey burger. It was flavorful and juicy. I built my own (forgot cheese-what was I thinking?!) ?  Got a side of fries--yum! Not greasy, very tasty.  Hubby got the grass fed beef burger and onion rings. Said burger was wonderful and that the rings are legit. They looked amazing! Ambience is great, good music when we were there. You order at the counter and seat 'yo self. We had a few employees check in on us to offer extra condiments, etc. very friendly!!  Overheard that if you sign up for their emails that you can get coupons. Will have to do that!"}
{"text":"Upscale burgers of Natural Angus beef, grass fed beef, cage free turkey or wild caught salmon filet.  Choose your bun, choose lots of toppings including a fried egg & duck egg. French fries great but sweet potato fries just ok."}
{"text":"If you are vegan, vegetarian or just like veggie burgers you must try the black and white bean burger here! Went for the first time and had this with a gluten free bun and all the veggies that were free. Also got a side of the fries. The burger was delicious, with a crispy outside, fresh and overall delicious. If you visit their website and signup for email you'll receive a 20% off coupon. I will definitely be back to visit!"}
{"text":"Burger was good the fries were very good I don't like most fries but these were  great. The service was very friendly and they are very clean"}
{"text":"Was craving a Turkey burger something crazy, I look up turkey burgers and it sends me here... When I say one of the best Turkey burgers I have had outside of my own!!! Great experience and customer service was very helpful with how u put the burger together. A lil pricey but well worth it..."}
{"text":"VEGAN review (and a money-saving tip at the end of the review):  Caveman Burgers is a fast food burger joint with options to customize your own burger. Lucky for us vegans, Caveman has a vegan bean patty, bun, and sauces (vegan options are: BBQ, habanero ketchup, and steak sauce... ironically). I asked for the BBQ sauce and the habanero ketchup on the side. I liked both the sauces I tried but the habanero ketchup was my favorite. It's not too spicy but gives the fries and burger a nice bite.   The vegan bean patty was fried as a way to keep the patty together. I thought it could use more seasoning and definitely more salt, but I appreciated the effort. The sauces can mask the taste of the patty, so I would recommend asking for the sauces on the side. The vegan (and gluten free bun) was fine, but cost an extra $2.   What really stood out at our visit was not just the vegan-friendly food, but the amazing service. From the woman taking our orders, to the cook, and the person on the floor, my friend and I received nothing shy of the best service.  To find Caveman Burgers, it is nestled next to the Jimmy Johns!  Money saving tip: you can get 20% off with Groupon and 7% off your visit with Yelp by linking your card. You can also get 20% off your first visit when you sign up for Caveman's emails through their website!"}
{"text":"East valley resident here. Was in the area looking to buy some Craigslist vehicles last Saturday. My wife and I got hungry so we looked for places nearby and stopped in for a late lunch. We were blown away by this place. Enough for us to still be talking about it two days later and we just got back from an exciting day of wheelin' in Box Canyon for what it's worth.  It is indeed a bit pricy but it's well worth it. I ordered the Arizona Grass-Fed Beef burger with a plain bun, grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, bacon, and peppercorn sauce with a side of fries and their habanero ketchup for dipping. Can't remember exactly what my wife ordered but she got the pretzel bun and onion rings with peppercorn dipping sauce.  I can't understand for the life of me how a simple burger, fries, and onion rings could taste so different yet good. You know that feeling when you're trying to decide what to eat by first trying to figure out what KIND of food you want (Mexican, Italian, etc.) but what you really want is something so new (to you) and/or different you'd probably be better off trying to invent or discover something no one's ever thought of? Caveman Burgers did just that (for us anyway) with just a simple burger and fries. Like, even with the fries and onion rings.  If they opened up a location in the east valley I'd send everyone I know their way, if only to sustain the place so we could keep eating there ourselves. (Caveman, we're around Country Club Dr and the 60 btw.)"}
{"text":"First attempt was opening week and they closed as we walked in because kitchen equipment had failed, I understand the restaurant business so I wasn't upset. Second attempt was a success and I don't have a bad thing to say. Food was de-lish and staff was friendly. Definitely go back again and I've recommended them to others."}
{"text":"Had the Arizona raised beef with a fresh baked bun with all the goodies and it was incredible! The house ranch was off the charts addictive."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best burger in town. Build your own burger with tons of options and good fries. Every time I come here it makes my day better. I like to get the Arizona grass fed beef 'cause it's nice to know you're keeping some of the money in the local economy. That's another reason this place is cool, it's not a chain, and the owner is usually there, and he obviously cares a lot about his  restaurant.  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Have to say that was a good burger! Loved the meat and the French fries were so good!"}
{"text":"Not really a read meat/burger fan. I went here with my family and could see how one could be a read meat/burger fan. Best burger I've ever had in my life. I had the grass fed beef on a pretzel bun with a duck egg on top. AMAZING!!! will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late lunch here today. The burgers were cooked perfectly and very fresh. We also had the onion rings and sweet potato fries. The onion rings are huge! The service was great! The staff checked on us to make sure everything was good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time I tried it the burger was awesome. Today the patty seemed much smaller, less flavor. Plus who charges for pickles? Will not go back."}
{"text":"Caveman is the best! They have gluten free options, vegetarian & vegan. The restaurant inside is a little small when busy but the food is great and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and outstanding burgers. If you like burgers, and let's face it, who doesn't, come check this place out. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful and delicious. I had the pleasure of seeing an old friend from school all the while being given exceptional customer service. But it didn't end there the food was phenomenal!! I picked exactly what i wanted on the burger and nothing short of delicious. The french fries crisp and not to salty as well as the lettuce full and satisfying. The meat didn't fight back to much all the while the sauces weren't overbearing nor barely there. All i can say is i will be back again soon hungry for more!! A+ for bishop\ A+ for food"}
{"text":"Caveman Burgers is a casual restaurant where you order at the counter, get your drink and seat yourself and wait with your pager. You have your choice of patty. Angus, Local Grass Fed, Wild Salmon Filet or Free Range Turkey. Then pick your choice of bun (pretzel is extra $2.) Toppings, some are unique like duck eggs and the prices can add up. They also offer other choices, sides and extras.  The staff made us feel welcomed when we came in and took the time to explain the menu to us.  I ordered a Wild Salmon Filet Burger Medium Rare on Fresh Made Bun with several toppings and we shared the fries. The Fresh Made Bun is Very Large and is too large for the small piece of Salmon. After one bite of all Bread I decided it would be a better ratio to eat the salmon open faced with a knife and fork and not eat the top bun. Some things about the sandwich were really great! I liked that the bun was fresh made and unique. It was soft like a cloud and didn't fall apart. The Beer Battered Onion Rings were Awesome! They were the tastiest onion rings that I remember eating. Basically everything about the sandwich was great expect for the bread ratio and....THE SALMON. My medium rare salmon was prettified and dry like chalk. The girl at the counter did drop by and asked how it was and I did tell her and she said that she was sorry and would tell the kitchen. I would not recommend getting the salmon.  My husband had the Local Grass Fed Beef on Soft Bun with some extras. He asked for Medium Rare and got Medium Well. He said his burger was OK but he thought the fresh bun was also a little large for the burger.  I liked that they let you get 1/2 & 1/2 Hand Cut Fries (Regular and Sweet Potato). I thought the fries were good!  This restaurant has been open a few months at the time of this review and they need to learn how to prepare salmon or buy a different kind of salmon or take salmon off the menu.  An overall OK but with some reservations"}
{"text":"Good burgers, really good fries but i thought it was a bit too pricey. The burgers were cooked well and fresh. Tasted very good quality meat :) The only thing i didn't like about my burger was the bun, it definitely overwhelmed my burger.   The fries were great as well as their peppercorn dipping sauce. The service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have ever had!  Grass fed beef with any of the toppings you can imagine! Great customer service.  The location is a little hidden but very much worth the time to find!"}
{"text":"Okay first of all these burgers are HUGE. I was stuffed after eating mine. It was also delicious! I ordered a burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, cheddar, green chilies, and mushrooms and it was amazinggggg. The burger was cooked to a nice medium, the meat was really flavorful, the toppings were fresh and there were lots of them, and the bun was nice and soft and dense enough o hold the monster burger. My husband ordered his with bacon, bbq sauce, and grilled onions and an extra patty and he was too full to finish it. It was equally delicious. The fries were just okay and the onion rings were huge and crispy, but a little too greasy. They also were almost $6 which was too much. I am giving four stars because it was expensive. For our two burgers, onion rings, and fries it was about $35. Next time (and there will be a next time) we just won't order fries or onion rings to make it a little more inexpensive. We were too full anyways from our burgers to miss them. Overall, delicious burger place, just skip the fries!"}
{"text":"First time in....friendly VERY friendly happy staff members. My burger was so fresh and the fries are bomb. I will be back in!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What great burgers!! We ordered them online and picked up our order! I have to say I was very pleased! The buns are delicious pretzel buns!! The meat is high quality and you can taste it in Every Bite!! The fries were really tasty also! Nicely done Caveman!! We will be dining there again...I highly recommend if you love a good Burger  like me!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique and delicious burgers I've ever had! When I'm up in the area again I'll definitely bring friends along again!!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers  Today, I visited Caveman Burger for the first time. The food and service are both excellent, great parking, extremely clean restaurant, owner on site, and the staff is  pleasant, helpful, and accommodating.   The menu is written on the wall. There isnt a huge selection however, there is enough, and you dont really need a huge selection, just a really good quality burger.    Caveman Burgers offers several beef and non-beef options. However, the attraction is the  quality of these fresh burgers, that are expertly prepared to order. Understand that there are no bargains here; expect to spend $10 - $15  for a burger, fries and a drink, more if you choose to have a beer or glass of wine.  I appreciated the fact that I can get a truly medium rare burger grilled to order.  I enjoyed the Angus Beef cheeseburger and fries, both were delicious. If you're looking for a fresh, delicious, grilled to order burger, give Caveman a try; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Burger! Really good fries too It's wonderful having a burger with Quality meat!  Fresh veggies and bun too, everything was to a higher standard.  Great option list too. I've been there about 5 times now and it's nice having a place my wife loves too, the hamburger is so good she hasn't tried the line caught salmon yet.  We like trying non-chain restaurants and Caveman's Burgers is a true winner over chain and non-chain.  Enjoy, we sure do."}
{"text":"Had a very good burger here, just wish the burger patty was thicker. Better than Five Guys by far... I got the natural angus burger with regular bun. The burger was juicy and tasteful. Again it would have gotten a five star rating if patty was bigger. My friend ordered burger from Five Guys across the street, it was dry and average. They didn't even finish their burger, I felt bad and let them rehab on half of my delicious Cave Man burger... they felt better."}
{"text":"Man oh man!!! I've been sleeping on this CMB establishment!!! They are located in the plaza immediately to the left of Safeway next to the fountain.  Today I did not feel like beef so went contra the norm and ordered the black and white bean burger and it did not disappoint!!! The burger is made of, duh, a delicious bean mixture but what really kicks it up a notch is the crispy panko breading. The manager?/owner mentioned he orders the bean burgers special for a local company right here in Phoenix. It held the burger together well without taking away from the true texture of the beany goodness ...mmmm :) :)   On to the french fries: They are fresh cut, not overly salted, double fried, I think, cuz they weren't limp and to top it off they were just as tasty cold (I eat slow lolol) as they were hot.  The sauces I tried were the peppercorn and CMB sauce and both were bomb! In fact, I think that CMB sauce would pair nicely with the salmon burger which is next on my list to try out.  Take your pick between comfortable outdoor and indoor seating to enjoy your burger and fries along with your on tap Coke product or bottled libation :) ;).  Something Yelp has been checking on lately is whether the restrooms are gender neutral and YES these are so you choose door number 1 or door number 2.  One regret I have though ;) is that I did not dine here sooner.  Carnivores and vegetarians can unite and happily dine together here. I will most definitely be back! \^_^./"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Definitely satisfies that craving! I will be going back often to get my fill of a darn good burger!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and kept the place clean. Food was very good and great quality. Will be back."}
{"text":"We LOVE Caveman Burgers. Since becoming vegan, we've been searching for places to go that have both vegan and non-vegan options so we can go with our family. This restaurant is PERFECT! No modifications necessary as it is a build-your-own-burger set-up. The black and white bean burger on gluten-free vegan bun is amazing. Choose whatever toppings you like! The staff is so friendly as well. Will continue coming with friends and family.  Only things stopping me from a 5-star review are: 1. It was questionable that they asked if we wanted the chef to refrain from buttering our buns since the buns are advertised as vegan, but definitely glad they asked. From now on we will specify that we want our gluten-free vegan buns to be vegan.  2. The burgers are pretty pricey. Recommend going during happy hour to avoid a $30 casual-dining experience for 2."}
{"text":"So, we hit this place out of the blue. It is a stand alone and not a chain. I really had no thought that this was going to be good from the outside but was pleasantly surprised after embarking upon it.  The place is nice and has a cute patio. The ordering process is cool and you get to make tons of choices and combinations for your burger. On the beef you can choose between Angus or Grass Fed. Their are many bun options including Gluten Free for the Celiacs.   Toppings are bountiful and if you are really adventurous you can opt for a grilled Duck Egg on your creation. The place is clean and well kept and the staff members were so accommodating.   They have alcohol offerings as well for those in need of a beverage to slap your burger down. This is a burger joint! There are no chicken offerings or anything else (fries of course) but alternative choices are not there. The is La Casa de Carne (The House of Meat).  We will be back as we all enjoyed it! If you are in the hood, come and check the out.  #cavemanburger #irishcatv2 #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Went to cmb yesterday got 2 burgers side of fries and onion rings, came to 30 bucks!!!! when we got home to eat there was no sauce like i requested on the burgers, also no side sauce for the fries or onion rings, was very exticed to try this place, but the price and no sauce kind of blew it for me."}
{"text":"Update 12/07/2016:  Their Angus Burger rocks.  The angus meat is very good.  Much better than the grass fed patty.  This time I ordered Angus Burger with cheddar, bacon, CMB sauce, pickles, sliced onions, green chilies, and tomato.  Ohhh So Good!!  I ordered it medium and it came out medium, perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time a couple weeks ago and I was pretty impressed.  You order exactly what you want on your burger which is important to me as I usually have to order burgers without things at most restaurants.  The fries were really good and the burger tasted great.  The one thing that irritated me (and this irritates me about 95% of burger places) is they asked how I wanted my burger cooked and I said WELL DONE, absolutely no pink.  Of course the middle of the burger was pink.  I have a huge aversion to eating red meat that is not fully cooked.  But I just cut this part out of the burger and ate the rest.  We would come back again - my husband really enjoyed his food as well."}
{"text":"We have found the BEST burgers and fries AND customer service in Phoenix. We were looking for a healthy (somewhat) burger and went to try Caveman Burgers. WOW. AZ grass fed beef, pretzel buns, amazing add ons like bacon, green chiles and avocado. And I'm not talking measly bacon. Quality. Like if you made the bacon yourself. Tips are not even asked for. Not on the check and no tip jars. They don't want you to feel pressured. But the service is stellar. EVERYONE SHOULD GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This is a great \"burger joint\". Had the 100% Arizona grass-fed beef burger with some toppings on the fresh-baked bun. One of the best burgers I have ever had! The ambience is clean though not \"fine dining\" - but if you're looking for a great burger, you may not be looking for white table clothes anyway, I know that my wife and I were not.  The owner/manager came over to check on us and I was quick to point out that it was one of my favorite burgers ever. Also, cooked to a perfect medium. The French fries are worth mentioning as well...you know, fresh cut slightly crispy on the outside, potato-y on the inside.   And for those not wanting meat, my wife highly recommends the white and black bean burger, made fresh locally!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place twice a day on my commute, so today we decided to check it out. The decor really fits the theme and the customer service was top notch. Being our first time, they really explained the process to us (think: build your own burger). Both of us ordered the grass-fed beef, one medium well on a pretzel bun & one medium on their standard bun. Both were amazing! My favorite thing was the onion rings. They almost have a tempura thing going on. Definitely worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: A medium sized burger causal restaurant, definitely would not call it a greasy burger joint as it has numerous high quality touches to the place. Has about ten tables inside and about ten outside. Decorated in caveman motif, appears new and well kept. Outside patio faces a large fountain. Good tunes playing, patrons of all ages.  Food: Obviously burgers but they are made to order where you choose EVERYTHING. your protein (beef, turkey, salmon, black bean) bun type (regular, pretzel, lettuce wrap) cheese type (American, cheddar etc) topping etc. Everything was delicious and given in very generous portions. Big props for them including turkey/fish/black bean options. They also have a kids menu and a decent beer and Wine selection.   Price: As mentioned before price somewhat on the high side. You'll up charge for some toppings ( 0.94 cents for grilled onions/shrooms). Then again this place serves quality grade meats so not maybe it fair pricing.  Service: Dined in, was well taken care of, checked on us numerous times.  Overall: A great place if you're in the mood for burgers but also want to dine in a nice atmosphere as opposed to greasy burger joint."}
{"text":"Saw the sign ,caught my eye. Caveman burgers catchy right. I tried the cheeseburger topped with Swiss. The burger patty itself was of good size.but way too much butter on the bun.thats all I could taste!.needed salt and pepper and nothing to be found anywhere.i would have ordered fries but I just can't justify almost 3 dollars for a potato.maybe I'll give it another try?"}
{"text":"This has to be the best burger in Arizona! Onion rings are to die for and they even have duck eggs as an option! Definitely will be returning..."}
{"text":"Burgers were ok. The pretzel bun was the best part. Everything was fine until afterwards where my whole family got the humdingereedoo shits (excuse my French). We ubered it by the way. Don't think it matters tho"}
{"text":"Nothing is bad, just not worth the almost $15.00 they charge. As I was eating my sandwich I glanced out the window and saw a Five Guys across the street and asked myself why I hadn't just gone there instead. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"okay... this is NOT your typical fast food burger.  Let me start with, it ain't cheap... especially when you add all of those delicious add-on items.  Now, I have to say it... it was worth every penny.  The basic burger is like $6.95, not bad... but then $2 to add a pretzel bun... (best pretzel bun I've ever had) and I added cheese and grilled sweet onions, again worth it, the beer battered onion rings and a soft drink... and POW, your over $13.  The staff is outstanding and friendly and very patient.  They truly want a satisfied customer.   Also, it not a standard burger... grass fed beef, Angus burgers, salmon , free-range turkey... yes it was that good....  the sweet potato fries were just okay, but their regular fries were above average. Three of us ate, and all three were impressed, and none of us finished our burgers, they were hearty meals.  In Summary...  try it, and don't worry about the sticker shock.... it ain't a McMeal!"}
{"text":"Seems as if the owners/employees and their friends or family are writing all these 5 stars. Speaking of 5 stars.... you'll find me across the street at 5 Guys unless your lower you're outrageous prices. If you're gonna charge 5Guys prices than you must have better food or at least offer something different.  Buhbye"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ever.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Juicy, not dry, the bun is nice and soft, doesn't break up, and the ingredients are fresh.  The staff are friendly and helpful when ordering, I went with what they recommended.  The fries have a twist on them as they can be seasoned.  Will go back whenever I'm on that side of town again."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Davie Bowie - Suffragette City)  Caveman, oh sing me a song you know Caveman, oh Bo Bites, get off the Iphone, I gotta Caveman, I gotta review your place This mellow burger just put my taste out of place Caveman, your burgers insane Caveman, your beef's are grass fed Caveman, well it's a total blam-blam   Caveman Burgers, so I gather it's what Paleolithic man would eat.  The place is somewhat hidden on the NW side of Bell and 7th Street.    I came with my buddy and it was a quiet Friday cause we got to ordering right away; awesome!  So the process goes like so; pick your beef, sides, buns, and finally type of fries.  Caveman offers everything from Angus Beef, Grass Fed, Cage Free Turkey, Wild Caught Salmon, and even Blackbean for Vegans.  I shot for the Grass Fed with the basics of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  I was also intrigued by the habanero ketchup; not to say I haven't had it before just wondering how it's made here.  For the bun they offer Baked Bun, Pretzel, Lettuce Wrap and Gluten Free Bun.  I went really basic and ordered the Baked Bun.  Finally, ending with a side of regular fries.    Overall, I thought the burger itself was cooked to perfection; medium and also the condiments were fresh as can be.  My habanero ketchup was a perfect mix; it was not overly spicy, but enough kick where I can taste other things.  My fresh cut fries were done correctly since it was not limp like most fresh cut fries; just the right temperature and crisp to hold!  I think my biggest \"beef\" was the bun and patty ratio.  I felt my beef patty was drowning in my bun and had to fight through a lot of bread to get to my patty!  Less bread or more patty would be my input. I gather it's larger in size to hold the extra sides so it doesn't get soggy, but I'm pretty basic.    Needless to say, I still like Caveman Burgers for their concept of fresh, locally, and environmentally consciousness.  I can always support any business doing such things.  The place itself is like a log cabin or a wood chopping mill.  Service seems pretty on top of things and in the end a place for quick bite for sure! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a very good burger. But we paid a little over $24 for two burgers and a drink (we had a coupon for free fries otherwise we'd be pushing $30). Admittedly we got some extras that added up, like cheese, mushrooms, fried onions, and even an egg but when the bill tallies up such as it did it sets expectations sky high. While good, Caveman just didn't reach such lofty heights.   Each burger was perfectly cooked to order and the service was VERY attentive. The quality is definitely good. I think I'd save the buck and a half each and go with the angus next time rather than the grass fed. I just don't think there's really going to be much difference.   With so many choices for a premium burger Caveman definitely is up there with the best of them. But pricing is a bit steep which would prevent me from becoming a regular."}
{"text":"My burger was cooked perfectly to order and tasted fantastic. Their fries are fresh cut and delicious.  I tried the Lunar ( it has two slices of provolone stuffed with blue cheese) for my first visit and am looking forward to going back to try another custom burger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so excited to try this place because of the grass-fed burgers and amazing Yelp reviews, but what a disappointment!  We should of known something was up when we were the only ones in there on a late Sunday afternoon.  I ordered a build your own type of burger and my bf ordered one of their specialty burgers that came with fries.  We were both disappointed with the huge lack of flavor of the meat!  Since it was our first time, the girl that took our order asked if medium was okay and we both agreed, but these burgers were very dry as well.  The fries were barely warm and not worth the calories, and the $5 onion rings that everyone raves about didn't taste like anything except the grease you could feel coating your throat as you ate them.  We didn't finish the fries or rings as they just weren't worth it.  Sad to say we wont be coming back here and wasting our money on flavorless food again.  Five Guys for the win!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a burger because a coworker recommended the place and wasn't disappointed.  The burgers are great.   All the veggies were fresh, the bread was good, the staff helpful.  The best part were the onion rings! OMG best I think I have ever had!  Go be a neanderthal for a half hour at Caveman Burgers and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had to try it out because it is so close to my house and I loved it. Knowing the meat is all Natural is the bomb for me. Wish it was less like a fast food inside but I am still a fan and will go back!"}
{"text":"Great build your own burger place.  I usually hate the back and forth with the questions and answers but the service was fantastic.   The burger was very good.  I ordered onion rings as my side.   Huge!   I would go (and will go) back just for the beer battered onion rings!"}
{"text":"Not bad, the fries and Burger needs more seasoning.  They shouldn't charge extra for specialty ketchup. The grilled mushrooms were a good addition. The tropical tea is good. I liked the bun and how they grilled it."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time since we were craving burgers! Found it by all the high yelp reviews and seemed like a newer place to try.   First impression. The atmosphere was great and super modern. I love all the rustic decor and was big with tons of tables and nice patio. Customer service was also great and everyone was very friendly. Food came up pretty quick and was hot. We took it to go.   The food would of definitely been better eaten there and super fresh but it was still good eaten at home about 15min later. I got a BBQ cheddar bacon burger and it was very good. Good size and tasted great. The bun was a little soggy and hard around the edge but that could of just been from taking it home. We also got the garlic and cheese fries that has shredded Parmesan cheese on top and they were amazing!!  I would recommend this place to others but to eat it there while it is fresh. Food is decent price for quality food but could get pricey depending on the topping you add. It was about $20 for my fiancé and I to get 2 burgers, a fry and a drink to split. Thank you (:"}
{"text":"Meh... reminds me of a fancy attempt at fast food. Unfortunately, they charge you more on the fancy side. Way overpriced food where you order at the front and just like an order from a Caveman, they bring you out your order 20-30min later. Must be figuring out how to make fire back in that kitchen or something. Food is good though. Nothing special in my eyes and I love a good burger, but it's not bad by any means. Next time I plan on spending $20 on a meal for myself, I'll go somewhere with a server and spend the same amount even after the tip."}
{"text":"The burgers especially the az cow meats have a great flavor ! I had to get the duck egg wth bacon on the burger , so good ! The fresh cut potatoes and sweet potatoes had the best flavor of fries!"}
{"text":"Great burger, lots of choices to build it the way you want.  \"Chip truck\" fries to go along with the burger.  Much better than the popular chain guys across the street.  Decent selection of brews to go with the burger, but alas no shakes.  I'll happily forgo the shake for a burger this good.  Staff are all very helpful and friendly too."}
{"text":"What a fun and unique place to get a burger or salmon or chicken sandwich. A sort of is a build-your-own sandwich select a  protein, bread, then sides.  I did a grass-fed beef and added a farm fresh, cage-free egg and bacon. You can upgrade to a pretzel bun which I'm going to try next time. And then they have all sorts of fun sides for free like mayonnaise etc.   The onion rings were probably the best onion rings I've had in like 10 years. The french fries weren't bad either. For the upgrade definitely get a side of ranch for $0.59 you will not be sorry.  Pro tip I was going to give this for stars but instead of give it 5 Stars cuz I believe I'm responsible for the one thing I didn't like.. the burger comes out with almost no pink next time I'm going to order it medium rare and then I will enjoy it even more."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a great burger.   Came on a Tuesday night and we were told it was \"topping Tuesday\" which means that all the toppings are half off. I had a behemoth of a burger and it was GREAT.   The burgers are cooked to your liking, the toppings are fresh and delicious, there are some unique toppings you can add (duck egg for example) and it's all really affordable.   The staff was friendly and happy to help and we just really enjoyed our meal here.   Highly recommend checking this new place out!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious! I had the salmon filet on a gluten-free bun and my husband had the turkey burger. Gluten-free bun stayed together and tasted good. Sweet potato fries were yummy and so was the pecan dipping sauce that we tried. Turkey burger was crazy juicy and better than most beef burgers for the same price. Love the fry seasoning choices. Whole restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. With all the options available for food and drink, it was not over complicated. Great experience will be back to try the beef. Brdrdrdrdrdrdaah pop pop pop!"}
{"text":"Excellent for people with food allergies.  The staff of very friendly and conscientious. The food and choices are excellent.  Amanda is very helpful"}
{"text":"The food is good for the price here. I had a gyro and it was tasty. My date and his daughter had burgers, both were good. Nothing blew us away here. For where it is and the price, this place can stay on my list, but there are definitely better burgers out there!"}
{"text":"Such a nice surprise! We stumbled upon this place for lunch and decided to give it a try. The firecracker burger was perfectly balanced with a nice kick, same with the fries. The owner came out and checked on us while we ate, very nice service to compliment the great food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint that doesn't seem to get talked about like the others. The menu is quite simple, but what we have had from it was delicious. We have already been back and will continue to do so when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Came here with my daughter and was pleasantly surprised!  Thought it was just another boring burger place but really enjoyed it. Staff was super friendly too!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a Caveman Burgers near me! This is as good as it gets!  Local Arizona Grass-Fed Beef is a patty option, along with their own Caveman Rub, Caveman Spices, and Caveman Sauce, etc. All delicious options. As well as seasoned fries and garlic parm fries. I was able to add fresh sauteed mushrooms and have a lettuce wrap as well.   I also love their long communal table and decorative accents. They definitely have an eye for detail in their atmosphere as well as their food.  Perfect-sized portions, high quality food and great service. Every burger lover should definitely give Caveman Burgers a try :-)"}
{"text":"Average burgers. Average fries. I've ordered from this place twice and each time it's... just... eh. And I keep saying \"well done\" for my burger and each time it's still a little pink.   Lastly, the build your own is a nice concept but also price can add up quickly."}
{"text":"Yum! Used ubereats for the first time with this place and it is one of the better burgers I have ever had. Be prepared to get dirty, between the sauce and the grease."}
{"text":"We came to visit during lunch time. We wanted something quick and easy. Luckily for us, there were only a few people in the restaurant so we didn't have to wait very long. I liked that you order at the counter and pick up your burger when it's ready. For a custom made to order burger, the portion, flavor and price wasn't bad at all! I ordered a grass fed beef patty with bun, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, chipotle lime sauce, and some other stuff. Hubby ordered a burger too with ranch and we used the check in offer for free fries. The order came to around $22.   Hubby liked his burger. I thought mine was good but I thought the patty itself was a little dry and because there was so much sauce on my burger, the bun started to get a little soggy. The ranch was really good and I liked the fries. Service was friendly and quick. Restaurant was clean and I dig the decor. Overall, it's a great place to get a good burger quickly at a decent price."}
{"text":"This place is great! First, let me just give a specific shout out to Elyssa. She was our cashier, and she was super nice and helpful. One thing that is frustrating at visiting places where the ordering system is different is that sometimes the cashiers seem annoyed that they have to explain it. Elyssa was super positive, greeted us warmly, walked us through how to order and gave us recommendations. Second, the food is good. They support local AZ farms by offering AZ grass fed beef. They cook the meat to perfection. And the CMB sauce is delicious. Also, the establishment is clean., and the food is affordable. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little neighborhood joint. Service was great the owner came out and spoke with us and thanked us . The good was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Just had this for dinner, and oh my goodness it was amazing. It's so well priced and I love that you can customize your burger (and bacon for $0.74 instead of the usual $2? AMAZING). I highly recommend this. It's such good quality food."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Great burgers and fries. The onion rings are the best I have had in Phoenix. I am glad it is close to home as we will be back soon"}
{"text":"I dislike the price of the meal but with the deals they offer I'm okay paying for an upscale burger. Since it's close to where we live we decide to go on occasion and have always enjoyed a great burger and fries. You order at the counter which can get kind of confusing as everything is ale-cart but the cleanliness. Friendly service and fresh food have me coming back for more"}
{"text":"My wife, world famous onion ring critic who must remain anonymous to protect her integrity, said \"best onion rings ever. Grass-fed beef burger was better than anything in our home town.\" I loved sauces, habanero ketchup, and the atmosphere. It's a place to eat and eat again."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for the ultimate burger, only think I would recommend is that I grabbed a double next time!"}
{"text":"First timer. Got the Dino's lunch special. BBQ bacon burger and fries. Fries are crunchy which I prefer and taste great. Burger is cooked medium and taste  like a quality patty. You can build your own burger or You can get vegan and turkey patties as well. Love the wood and metal decor. I will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give more stars because there are so many good things about this place. So keeping that in mind, the stars are really based on one very important thing. I ordered the Arizona grass fed beef. The cashier asked if medium well was ok, I said yes. I also heard her asked other customers the same question. One bite into the burger and I knew that it wasn't medium well. It was more like medium rare. Very pink inside. Of you're ok with pink then there are no issues. To be fair, this could be just that particular visit, I don't know. I'm visiting from our of town and won't have a chance to try it again.  Now the good. Aside from the burger patty, the bun and toppings were all very fresh and very good.  Now for the really good. Get the onion rings. They are among the best that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious!  It does get a bit expensive as you add things to it, but if you like to customize a nice juicy burger occasionally, this is the place to do it. Fries are delicious as well! Not greasy, and a large serving as well!! Servers were pleasant and greeted us right away. We'll go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent burgers, thick 1/3 lb burger not thin barely meat like a lot of places, however you pay for it, burger start at $8 and everything is ala carte, a burger itself can quickly end up $11-12 just for the burger, then add $4-5 for fries or onion rings plus drink.  Lots of options for add ones, bacon, several different cheeses, fried egg (don't know where this trend came from), pretzel bun or gluten free bun options.   I found the onion rings to be super greasy, fries also were very greasy, but at least not over salty.  For family of 3 it was over $50   We like to try new or different places, but I think it's unlikely we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Finally a place  where you can get a real burger. Mushroom Swiss my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy place to eat but I was also very hungry and tired. I came across this place online and I thought the menu was pretty different and healthy for a burger place and I saw they had a turkey burger option so I decided to try it. I placed my order and about 20 minutes later, Grub Hub delivered it to my hotel room. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! I'm going to order from them again .....maybe tonight! I cannot recommend this place enough, and I'm a very picky eater! GO HERE, that's an order! LOL"}
{"text":"Food was pretty awesome! The pretzel bun was fantastic and the over all quality very pleasing. I didn't get to try the fries but will on my next stop!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving burgers and figured we'd try this spot out. We ordered delivery on Uber Eats and got our food promptly! We both  tried the Dino Diet burger and were pleasantly surprised by the great flavor/tasty bacon. I love the fact that you can add fried egg to your burger! I guess I am used to Smash Burger where it's an over hard fried egg, where as Caveman burgers prepares a slightly runny fried egg (not my preference). We were a little disappointed that our receipt specified pickles and grilled onions but neither of our burgers had them. Our fries weren't fresh (probably because we ordered 10 minutes to close) but still decent. Overall this place was good, I will probably dine in next time to avoid getting an incorrect order."}
{"text":"Grass fed meat was really savory with the gluten free bun! Getting to choose what toppings you want makes it a unique burger everytime!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Caveman Burgers once I found out they had grass-fed beef. It's not easy to find places that serve that! Unfortunately, after I had the burger my excitement dwindled.  My husband and I stopped in on a weeknight and when we walked in there was no one there. We went to the counter and the woman working walked us through the options. We both ordered a make-your-own burger with grass-fed beef. And we got an order each of sweet potato fries and onion rings. First things first - this place is not cheap. My husband did get a couple add on's - bacon and an egg, but I didn't and we didn't order any drinks - our bill was like $30!  Considering we were the only customers it seemed like our food took kinda long to arrive at our table but it's made to order so I suppose that's to be expected.   The burgers were very messy, you will definitely need extra napkins. Now, I could get behind a messy burger if it tasted good. This one was just kinda meh. One, it was overcooked. No pink whatsoever. Two, they totally skimped on the sauce. Three, the flavor of the meat was just kinda lackluster overall.   The fries and onion rings weren't much better. Fries were pretty overdone and the onion rings were just too much of everything - too much onion (really thick), too much breading (fried gut bomb), and too much grease. Plus the $5 price tag for like 6 onion rings that we didn't even finish because they were basically just fried on top of fried onions and grease.   One thing that was really good was their ranch. Highlight of the meal.  After we left we saw a Five Guys across the street. Next time, we'll just go there."}
{"text":"So on a whim the wife said let's go get a Burger for Dinner.  Wanting to go somewhere new, we decided to come to Caveman.  Best decision of the week.  Great Burgers! Great Fries! Great Onion Rings!  But if you like Ranch with any of these ?  Let me tell you this is the best Ranch Dressing I have ever had!  Looks like we have found a new weekly dinner spot!   Thanks Caveman for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Not too happy with the food. Husband ordered Grass fed burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and cheese. Burger tasted like it had been reheated. Onions were barely existent. Also had sweet potato fries which also tasted like they were reheated or maybe oil just needed to be changed. I had salmon which was good but now I have a stomach ache from either the fries or salmon. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place.  I had high hopes, but it just didn't live up.  We tried the grass-fed burgers without a ton of toppings (to taste the meat itself), and it was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  We tried the fresh cut fries, onion rings, and sweet potato pie fries with pecan dipping sauce.  None were very good...the sweet potato fries were downright soggy, bland flavor even with the dipping sauce.  The regular fries were slightly more crunchy but still soggy-ish.  Onion rings were too heavy on the batter:onion ratio, and...you guessed it...soggy!  Sadly, the 2 stars is just for the vibe of the place and the nice customer service when ordering .  Food was just blah.  And our dinner was $30...I could have spent the $30 much better, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I was very excited for Caveman Burgers to open and followed their FB religiously to find out their open date! Me and my boyfriend went there, and ordered to go. The total came to a little under $30, which for me is fairly expensive for a burger and fries. The food was quick and when the employee came over to let me know that my fried egg was separate so it wouldn't pop in transit, I let him know I ordered it hard, so there should be nothing to pop. He took it back and fixed the order quickly which was appreciated. So, once we got home, my burger also has no lettuce, which I had ordered. Also, my boyfriend ordered the fresh avocado which was not ripe at all. He ended up taking it out of his burger. He tried to smash it his fingers and it was so hard that it would not even do. Pretty disappointing considering the extra cost. My final complaint, is that a pretzel bun (upgrade) costs $2.00. This was what I was most excited about, and then to find out that my burger starts around $8.00 and to have the bun I actually want takes it to $10 without any toppings! Seems a little outrageous to me... Now that I have voiced my grievances I can highlight the pros. One, it was very filling which can be hard to do with burgers. Two, the French fries, while they are a little too greasy for my taste, taste phenomenal with the garlic and cheese topping. Finally, I am ecstatic about having green chilies for a topping!  I have not decided if I will be back or not."}
{"text":"We loved the visit the food was great and juice gets and onion rings great clean and meet and the restrooms. We will be back"}
{"text":"Heard some good buzz among my fellow Yelpers and wanted to check this place out. Very cool decor inside with lots of treated wood and modern light fixtures. Music was a little loud but we imagine it wouldn't be as noticeable with a dining room full of patrons to help balance it out.   Service was excellent. Gentleman came over and went through the menu with me knowing it was my first time and helped with some recommendations.   We tried the Salmon Filet on a bed of lettuce, an Angus beef burger with American and a side of their fries. Fries were very good and cooked perfectly. Not quite steak fries but thicker than shoestring. The salmon was undercooked for our liking but they didn't ask how we wanted it prepared so maybe that was our fault for not specifying cooked thoroughly? If we come back we'll make a point to ask how they cook it to make sure that isn't the norm. Burger patty itself was of good quality, but didn't come wth all of the toppings I requested, which was surprising since they were not busy at all. Luckily I didn't get charged for the up charge ones so no clue how the fella didn't hear me while ordering. While the bun was good, there was waaay too much of it for the thin patty so I ended up taking the bottom bun off completely.   It was worth a try and glad we did, but most likely won't go out of our way to come back anytime soon. Sad to say, but I'll hit the place I can get \"In and Out\" of by our house for half the price of Caveman 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Great place! A little bit hidden. Very good food at reasonable prices.  Service was outstanding.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for dinner the other night. It was our second time. He loves the grass fed Arizona burger. The buns are fresh and buttery. I had the black and white bean veggie burger and it was delicious as it was the first time we were here. I don't eat much meat so I appreciate a good veggie burger. We shared the natural cut fries which were great too. Portions are big here so I can never seem to finish my food. But even with the large portions quality is good and prices are very reasonable. I like that they try to use local stuff. Everyone here is friendly and welcoming. A great place to drop by for fast casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hidden little jem! All natural grass fed burgers, great flavor and awesome dressings! Definitely a great find"}
{"text":"While the concept itself is anything but new in present day food culture, I'm always up for trying these \"premium\" burger shops. There's a Five Guys directly across the street, so I'd suggest just pretending that it doesn't exist.  Servers were eager to welcome us and explain the menu. Grass-fed beef or angus are your choices - unless you're into chicken or fish. There's a traditional bun, pretzel bun upgrade, or lettuce wrap option. For someone who only eats at corporate chains, it's probably mind-blowing! But for a foodie, it's a fairly textbook concept that most of these places follow. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  The question is: Are the burgers as great as people are currently saying?  Well, they're definitely decent, but it might take a bit of experimentation to find what works best for you. I opted for a grass-fed burger with a pretzel bun and a duck egg. Those upgrades alone, when you factor in the fries and a small soda, ended up totaling 20 dollars.    Ouch!  My girlfriend played things more conservative by sticking with a basic angus burger with a traditional bun, avoiding all of the pricey upgrades. Honestly, her meat was just as good as mine, while her fresh baked bun seemed a better fit than my pretzel. Maybe it's just a subjective thing, but there was just something overly chewy about the pretzel. Again, that's only my opinion.  French fries are decent, but be very careful with the seasonings. There are various options. Probably far more variations than are necessary, as if they're trying to cater to the tastes of virtually anyone who might step in. Sometimes simplicity works best - which is why some of the best fries you'll find find don't use (or need) seasoning.  Although it's by no means the best burger I've ever had, it is more than enough to satisfy people who are seeking something beyond the chain restaurants that fill up these Bell Road strip malls. For that, I give them credit and predict that they'll do quite well as word continues to spread. I'm sure we'll revisit at some point in the future and I plan to update my review accordingly.  Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Good spot for paleo focused diet. The build your own approach is convenient and allows for customization. The decor is somewhat utilitarian but they do serve craft beers!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have awesome burger and fries, but the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Definitely going here again. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"VERY IMPRESSED!!!  From the service to the food the attention to detail is fantastic!  We were asked if it was our 1st time there, said it was, and was told how the place works in a very useful and concise manner. The manager was there to explain the restaurant concept, options and process to us.  Place was a little empty, won't be for long once the word gets out!  The food:  I had a regular old bacon burger with bbq, mustard and jalapenos.  Nothing too crazy, want to try the burger itself without getting too lost in toppings. Loved it..maybe my favorite burger place now!!  Friend got the burger with the pretzel buns. The pretzel buns are brought in fresh daily we were told, and you could sense that. My friend had one and said it was super light, airy and amazing!  I will definitely try that next time.  Fries were cut from actual potatoes and were nice golden color.  Not under cooked like so many places do.  Everything was perfect!  ***Only corn syrup in the place was in sodas, they even offer organic ketchup as well as the Simply Heinz they use by default.  That's amazing!  Been trying to cut out corn syrup for years, restaurant ketchup is the only time I ingest that 'stuff' anymore...not here!***  5 STARS!!  WILL BE BACK AGAIN REAL SOON!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best black bean I've ever had! All ingredients were very fresh, service was swift and the location is spotless."}
{"text":"A-FREAKING-MAZING I love that you can customize your burgers down to the sauce. It was so gooood! From avocado to all the bun choices, you can't go wrong if you love burgers!  Plus, the name of this place is unique. Do stop by if you're near by!"}
{"text":"Homemade ranch, beer batter onion rings....I mean you just can't go wrong.  We ordered a Captain Caveman burger which has a duck egg and green chilies among other things and a Dino's diet which is a standard burger but throw in bbq sauce.  The ambiance is ok.  I like the rustic look but the benches are a bit hard on the tushie.  Burgers are delish, fries perfect.  They have some great concoctions or you can build your own.  Highly recommend!!  I would have given 5 stars but the seating needs some work.  Open till 9"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint, however it is a little on the pricey side so I haven't been back.  For 30$ for my husband and I we would rather go din in at a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a fast-casual spot with upscale burgers, fries, and onion rings. Small storefront, but surprisingly spacious interior.  I like it. I want to bring people here. It's a really nice space that would actually be great for a casual business meeting with plenty of table space for laptops (I wonder if they have wifi?). Or to meet a lunch date. They have a nice little beer and wine selection available too.   So I ordered a regular burger with mushrooms, avocado, and CMB sauce. I opted for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun, along with a side of sweet potato fries because I can't decide if I want to be healthy or fat sometimes.   I was handed a buzzer and the owner said they would bring my food to my table when it was ready. I chilled with my beer for a bit before he came around to my table. He apologized and said that he didn't like the quality of the avocados for the day and that he could either replace it with something else or refund my money, no problem. I love when businesses do that instead of just slide out sub-par food and cross their fingers that the customer doesn't notice.   Anyhow, he very kindly added a duck egg to my burger. Duck egg! I felt very fancy despite my unwashed hair.   Dude. This burger was delicious and messy as all hell. Note to self: lettuce wrap a burger only when dining alone.   Five stars. Will definitely return. Great employee interaction, quality food and beer choices, and it's super close to my place. MORE BURGERS PLS."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended Caveman Burgers to us, since it was close to the house.  So we cruised over one night and gave it a shot.  The ordering system isn't too bad.  You are essentially building whatever you want your burger to be.  But, you also have an itemized fee structure for the toppings.  It's nice to know I can build my own custom burger, but get stuck behind someone that can't make a decision... it may be a while.  I'd suggest posting a Top 5, or something to that nature.  It would speed things up a bit.   Once we got the burgers, my wife and I had different opinions.  She felt her regular Angus burger had no flavor.  I felt that my Angus burger patty tasted pretty good.  She got the pretzel bun, which overwhelmed the burger.  Way too much bun for the size of the patty.  I had the regular bun and it seemed to fit just fine.   I tried the sweet potato fries.  They were OK.  My wife had the parmesan fries.  Those were WAY better!   All in all, the food was good.  We sat on the patio, and staff checked in on use which was nice.  That made us feel like we were in a service oriented place.  What made the experience LESS than desirable was the price.  We were just under $40 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 drinks.  In my opinion, it was not a $40 meal."}
{"text":"cool burger spot, will definitely come back whenever we're over on that side of town.    people have commented in their reviews about high cost, but honestly the price is comparable to any other restaurant that sells a gourmet burger.  the difference is this meat is grass fed, even with the option of of grass fed AND locally raised beef!!    i got my burger on lettuce and sweet pot fries - loved it!  the guys that we were with were stuffed halfway through eating theirs, so splitting a burger is definitely and good idea at this place, it is really filling and i think its gotta be all the fresh/healthy food that they use.    quality spot, i'd recommend to anyone and i'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to this place and both times the service took over 30 minutes. Today I had to spend another 10 minutes trying to get a refund because it turned out that they had lost my order and gave my food away.  The cashier claimed she was new but it was clear that no one in the restaurant was in a hurry to fix their mistake. I'd  expect a little better out of a $14 burger."}
{"text":"If you're a burger guy, you have to try this place. I got the angus beef on pretzel bun and It was great."}
{"text":"Very disappointing... I stopped eating my burger half way... Or just didn't settle well. My bf ate all his and we had upset stomachs app day, they just day there like a rock. The service pretty much sucked and for what it cost  We really could have went to a nicer place. I'll never go back, it's actually become a joke."}
{"text":"Straight garbage. Don't waste your money. Bun was ice cold and the whole meal was below average. Charged me for bacon and didn't even put bacon on the burger because it wasn't ready, came out 10 minutes later. Five guys is across the street y'all"}
{"text":"Caveman Burgers is a great burger place because they are juicy, big, and healthy. I love burgers and almost always order one wherever I go, so of course I liked this place. You can build your own or order a named burger on the menu! I built my own, but everything you add makes it pretty expensive. I am gluten and dairy free so I had the gluten free bun that was dry and not great. I prefer lettuce as my bun but wanted to pick it up and eat it. My family said the onion rings were the best they ever had! The French fries are just ok... I liked the burger to bun ratio because the burger was much bigger and that there are healthy options and organic meat. I wouldn't go out of my way to go again, but it was good and a fun place to go with family and friends."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!! You will not be disappointed! Fast food style with better burgers that Red Robin."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! one of my new favorite burger joint. Definitely worth giving a try. It was everything I expected plus more."}
{"text":"I ordered caveman burgers using UberEATS for the first time tonight. It was the best burger I've ever had. it was perfectly cooked and came on an awesome freshly baked bun and it was the perfect size perfect size burger. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and onion rings and they were good but I could only eat a couple because I gobbled the whole burger enjoying every bite. This will be my go to burger from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger I've ever had. I got The Lunar and will 100% be back! The staff was friendly and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"Great burger place with exceptional reasonably priced burgers!!! Came to this place based on the yelps reviews and this place definitely lives up to the hype. My girlfriend and I both got Angus beef burgers, and the temperature was cooked just how we liked it. The concept of BYOB was perfect as premium toppings were reasonably priced. We did not have fries (wish we could on our diet!) but they looked great. Definitely a place to come for a quick eat or a casual dinner with quality ingredients. Decor was great and created a quality atmosphere. Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Good but gets pricey.  The burgers are good but the get increasingly more expensive if you want toppings such as cheese or grilled onions. The garlic cheese onion rings are definitely worth a try I would go back for those alone"}
{"text":"Ordered food late from Uber eats, granted last minute and it's never fun. As a fellow cook and also chef, delivering sub par food to a guest no matter what time. We continue to provide the best value of food at all times, be it VIP or a random first time guest; in which I was. Ordered the Salmon Burger on a lettuce wrap, two sides of onion rings and one side of sweet potato fries. Burger was good and as well we're the onion rings! Though, the fries look like black truffles... Double, maybe even triple fried. Unsatisfied with that lack of quality."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on 4/17/17 having heard of it but hadn't had the opportunity to try it. When I first walked in, I immediately liked the theme with all the caveman symbols and decor - it was like the movie Encino Man. I was greeted by a very cheery & chipper customer service oriented woman named, Mandy. She patiently walked me through the slightly confusing ordering process & how the menu worked. Its very hard to find \"grass fed\" beef these days since most beef cows are unfortunately \"corn-fed\" which is completely unnatural for beef cows, so I naturally gravitated toward that option. They have other options for their beef patties (Natural Beef, Salmon-Filet, Turkey Burger & Black/White Bean Burger) but the grass-fed was the choice I wanted.   Now, the menu options are set-up similar to Five Guys on how you add your toppings with one caveat, some of the toppings are free while others are up-charged - cheese being one of them which was disappointing but understandable. Some of the \"Specialize It\" options include a \"cage-free fried eggs, avocado slices, mushrooms, bacon as well as extra patties\" ($2.74 or $3.84). The next step in the ordering process was the \"Trim-It\" which is where you order your choice of sides including Fries, Sweet Potato Fries and Beer Battered Onion Rings (This was what I ordered) all of which cost $2.94, $3.94 & $4.94 respectively. The sides are cooked in sunflower oil and seasoned with salt & pepper. After this you can \"Change It and/or \"Dip It\"  which basically means adding specialized seasoning and sauces which I opted for the \"CMB Sauce\" which is their house sauce and resembled Thousand Island dressing but was much much better tasting - and messy but delicious.  I took my ticket and order number and sat down and was promptly greeted by the owner, Jeff, who thanked me for coming in and asked how my day was. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, my food was delivered shortly after and I began to devour it! This was one of the most tastiest, juiciest burgers I've had and definitely of restaurant quality . The bread was very thick and fresh baked - I was told the bun was thick because some people like to make a $20 burger and add damn near everything so the bread is thick enough to hold everything together and not fall apart. The bread had a sweet and soft taste to it. The burger simply tasted better than most burger joints, and I love Five Guys but this burger tasted gourmet to me. I was then greeted by Jeff again asking about how the food was showing genuine care for his customer's satisfaction. That alone was an exemplary example of great customer service and how a business owner truly puts their heart & soul into their business by putting their customers needs at the forefront.  In theory, this place was very unique and a good eat; however, the ONLY downfall to this place is the price. I paid $17.22 for a single 1/3 lb grass-fed cheeseburger, onion rings and a large fountain drink. That's a lot of money to spend on one person for a fast-food themed lunch compared to In-N-Out or Five Guys where the prices are much lower. Now, this will not deter me from coming in again, but it will limit the amount of visits I make when I can go get a cheaper burger and fries/rings elsewhere. This is not a dis on Caveman Burgers by any means! Let me make that perfectly clear - the fact that the owner and the people inside were beyond friendly and accommodating was worth it weight in gold, but in hard economic times, pricing is everything to a lot of people, it's simple microeconomics and people vote with their wallets most of the time. Thank you Jeff & Mandy for the welcoming experience. I'll be back again in the future."}
{"text":"People are very friendly.  Food comes out hot.  Tomatoes, onions, lettuce are all cut thick and are fresh and tasty.  French fries hot and tasty and not oily at all.  Their sauce is watery and all leaks out of the back like a waterfall.  The burger patty itself doesn't have any flavor (frozen?) and has a thick grainy texture.  The eating area is just plain with tables, chairs and a few booths. We sat in a booth and the seat was really uncomfortable.  This is a hamburger place and the one thing that wasn't very good was the hamburger patty...................."}
{"text":"Don't go. Sweet potato fries have no staying power, as soon as they cool down even a bit, they are cardboard. I got this thing called \"The Gatherer\". It's vegan, which is why I ordered it. Oh yeah, and it is deep fried. Kind of tasted like a falafel, but instead of yummy chicpeas had this stale beany flavor that took over the whole sandwich. I'm not a snob. I love meat and even grubhubbed a 3rd-pound Angus burger for my wife. She never got it. They canceled the order. So I guess this a barb against GrubHub too. Three to five days on prepaid orders \"as your banks make it happen\". Then they sent me a five dollar coupon as a salve. Piss poor. That was the second and 'last' time I use either services."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, you wont get a dry burger here. Dress it up how you like. The onion rings were incredible. Service was very attentive. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Burgers were so delicious! The cashier didn't even judge me for ordering a vegan bean burger on lettuce, no bun, with steak sauce!  However, I docked em 2 stars due to irresponsible waste bins. Literally 100% of the things I had to throw away were either compostable or recyclable. I feel like a piece of $H*T for sending it to the landfill.  Caveman's fault."}
{"text":"Firestarter is the best burger in town. No one is even close. I wish they were on the west side."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a burger joint for sometime now. I ate at The Caveman Burger which has a little flair with their menu without being pretentious.  Well my wait is over. Wow this is the tastiest burger I have eating. I just had the basic Angus Beef it was spot on temp wise ( medium rare) & the fries were absolutely done to perfection as was the burger. Downside when word gets out the line will be out the door guaranteed. Now that I tried their food time to try their a little more exotic selections. Although the fries were superb, but how about fries cooked in Duck Fat. I found my homebase for burgers and only 1.5 miles away. I would have given 4.5 stars but wasn't able to.  First visit never gets 5 stars and never had I given out 4.5 stars for that matter."}
{"text":"This place servers some kick ass burgers and fries.   I got the pretzel bun with the Angus burger, avocado, pickles, and condiments. It was really good.  Fries were crisp and the ranch tasted like buttermilk ranch. This place seems like Fired Pie the Burger Joint....and I dig that.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  They offer deal discounts for your birthday, weekly specials and frequent visit punch cards!  Indoor/outdoor seating is comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Great brewed iced tea!"}
{"text":"Crisp flavorful French fries and ranch were my favorite. I got the roasted garlic and cheese on the fries. Mmm.  Burgers were alright although I didn't like that the bun is not warmed at all."}
{"text":"Not as impressed as I hoped to be. Burgers and toppings were good but the fries had seasoning options (pass on this!). I was so excited for the garlic Parmesan and it was basically dry seasoning w some Parmesan- think popcorn seasoning. Made it very salty and inedible."}
{"text":"This is  a place the Flintstones would like. Everything is fresh & not frozen, the beef is  fresh & the salmon. Fries are fresh. They have a homemade sauce that so amazing. The owner is Jeff & very accomodating. Go to groupon & get the 20% off, you do not have to buy it, just claim it the discount applies once you order, Enjoy"}
{"text":"Awesome grass fed burger joint! I eat primarily paleo so it's great to have a paleo friendly place nearby. Service was amazing and prices were not bad. I will definitely be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"So again UberEats to the rescue. Friday night after a long work week my boyfriend and I pulled up the app and I found Caveman Burgers on the list, not too far from the house, and looked like a quick turnaround. I showed him the picture and he was sold, so we ordered burgers and fries, onion rings, some sauces and chowed down.  It was so delicious, after being driven to our house, that we both looked at each other and said we've got to go in. Yesterday afternoon we stopped by Caveman and was pleasantly greeted by the staff. The décor was pretty modern, some reclaimed wood on the walls, metal sconces,  but honestly who's going to Caveman for the décor, lets talk food.  We both ordered the grassfed which was cooked to a medium-rare. Delcious and large portion. I got the pretzel bun because come on, pretzel bun. It's a freaking pretzel as a bun. He got the regular bun, some bacon, and other stuff I don't know I didn't pay that much attention. I just wanted MINE. Friday night I ordered a swiss mushroom burger with grilled onions, delicious, yesterday I got a pretty basic burger, ketchup, mayo, tomato, lettuce, pickles, and onions. I wanted to see if it still held up, oh it did. We also ordered fries and onion rings on Friday and had to get some fresh hot out of the fryer onions rings. So I ordered sweet potato fries and he got the onion rings. These onion rings are delectable. When you bite into the crispy beer batter and pull, the entire onion stays within the confines of the rest of the batter. It doesn't slide out, you know the kind, where it's over in one bite. These were perfect each bite, the onion stayed inside! Dip that sucker into the chipotle lime sauce or the CMB sauce and it's heaven in your fingers.   My favorite part, they had La Croix on hand. I know I'm one of those people, I love sparkling water, give me a break. They also had some local beer available, and a soda fountain so you don't have to drink my fru fru water. But hell, I'm pretty peachy keen on it.  We'll be back, we'll be back multiple times. I know Five Guys is across the street, but IMO Caveman has a better burger."}
{"text":"SKIP THE BALLPARK FOOD AND EAT HERE AFTER THE GAME! Eating paleo and travelling is tough... but not here! Had a great lettuce wrapped Arizona grass fed burger, with tomatoes, jalapenos, red onion and more lettuce. It was amazing. The owner also came to our table to check on our meal and tell us he appreciated it that we came in."}
{"text":"Great turkey burger, glad they will customize burgers.  Kids loved kids meal and the Lucy burger.  We will defiantly be back.  I love the homemade ranch with the fries.  Great selection on beer, glad it's not domestic.  Friendly staff and manager."}
{"text":"Caveman has the best burgers in Phoenix. You can choose one of theirs or build your own. The french fries are amazing! They are kennebec potatoes and they are fried twice. I like mine \"extra-crispy\" and the staff is happy to oblige. The salmon is delicious on a salad and is generously portioned for the price. They serve coke products and have heinz ketchup as well as other house made dipping sauces. The place is Paleo friendly if you are into that. It is such a treat to have a restaurant like Caveman nearby."}
{"text":"This is a great burger place! Get away from the chain burger joints and try this one. Build your own burger and friendly staff. Clean and unique restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like the concept that caveman Burgers has for eating paleo or not without having to special order. I love that you can get your burger lettuce wrapped, on a bed of mixed greens, or on a regular or gluten-free bun. Side dishes however are all fried in sunflower oil, which is a food sensitivity for me. How about a non fried side dish? I like that the toppings are all half price on Tuesdays, and are fairly reasonably priced to begin with. The meat is very high quality, cook to order. If you join their email list, you get the 20% off coupon.  Oh and the logo CMB turned on its side looks like a little Burger, so cute! I will be back."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant visit at this location. I was immediately greeted by the cashier and manager. I ordered there lunch special which was only 11 bucks, it came with fries, drink and a burger of your choice. I did wait 8-10 mins for the food to come out but it was well worth it. The French fries tasted fresh like they hand cut them, the burger was really good, the meat was definitely from grass fed cows, and tea was good. I also had the manager come up to my table and asked if everything was ok. Great customer service guys!"}
{"text":"One of the worst hamburger places I've ever been to ..sweet potato fried were soggy ..no taste meat and definitely over priced ..McDonald's would be a much better choice  .. can't understand how these pig food places stay in business  .."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows that I seek out burgers like a hungry dog on the trail of a rabbit.  Caveman came across the horn pretty high on the list with some high praise so I decided to check it out.  I was alarmed to say the least and almost didn't go in when I saw that there wasn't a single person inside at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  In fact, the only customers I saw the entire time I was here was two, maybe three, people picking up to go orders.  Maybe it was just an off night or maybe this is more of a lunch spot.  Despite my skepticism based on the empty restaurant, I ventured in and am glad that I did.  Once at the counter I found Amanda, an extra friendly cashier that upon learning that it was my first visit, enthusiastically explained the menu and ordering options.  Finding someone who is friendly and actually acts as if they care is not nearly as common as one would hope so a plus to my experience here.  As for the burger itself, you start with your choice of natural Angus beef, Arizona grass fed beef, salmon, turkey or veggie.  Being a traditionalist, I stuck with beef and opted for the Angus beef in lieu of the grass fed option at a $1.30 up charge. I thought the base beef option was great and personally cannot imagine that the premium option is noticeably better in terms of taste.  As for the transport device, you get you choice of fresh baked bun, bed of mixed greens, lettuce wrap, pretzel bun (+ $2) or gluten free bun (+ $2).  As tempting as the pretzel bun was, I stuck with the fresh baked bun and was glad that I did.  The bun was fresh and seriously as fluffy and soft as a high end bath towel.  This is a very impressive bun to say the least.  Another plus here is the sauce and topping options that far exceed that of most any burger place that I've experienced.  Among the no cost add topping options they have the standard lettuce, tomatoes and pickles along with sliced red onion, green chilies, jalapeños and hot peppers. As for the no cost add sauces, there is the standard ketchup, mustard and mayo along with CMB (savory house sauce), sweet and tangy sauce, habanero ketchup, BBQ, ranch, steak sauce, chipotle lime. dijon, hot sauce, siracha and creamy peppercorn sauce. In terms of premium add (+ $) options, there is cheese in choice of American, Cheddar, Swiss or pepper jack and topping choices of grilled sweet onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, avocado, fried egg or onion ring.  Realistically, just about anything you could think of to want to add to a burger is offered here.  I opted for lettuce, tomato, pickle, diced green chilies, bacon, American cheese and the house CMB sauce and the result was absolutely outstanding.  The CMB sauce, while very good, did seem like it kind of took over the burger.  If ordering the CMB, I would recommend asking for a lighter dose of it to ensure none of the other flavors are over powered.    At $8.12 for the basic burger with house bun with a premium add of bacon and cheese, the price point seems a touch high and more so with a total of $14.34 with the addition of fries and a medium drink.  There is currently a check in offer on Yelp for free fries that will save you $2.94.  Despite the slightly high price point, I do not mind paying extra for quality and uniqueness, both of which you definitely get with Caveman.  I would welcome any chance to eat here again and try some different burger options."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for a really good burger? How about top of the line adds like natural bacon, a fried egg, or even a fried  duck egg? Then there are a few sides; we went with cooked-to-order onion rings that were excellent. There are a couple of delicious sounding desserts, but we passed-- even on the sweet potato fries pie with pecan sauce. The atmosphere is  a bit fancier than chain burger places, but nothing special. The service, order at the counter and they bring your food to the table, is considerate; we were asked numerous times if the food was good. It was better than good. The two negatives are a limited menu--vegetarians go elsewhere-- and the price. When you add it up, the bill is a lot higher than that chain joint that you'll find at every highway rest stop."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for a hamburger this is where I head! Grass fed beef and locally made gluten free buns with all of the toppings you could want, even sweet potato fries! The employees here are always super friendly. Great little neighborhood burger joint. Plus, if you sign up for their rewards program they are always sending deals to me via email. Fast service but still room to sit down and enjoy your meal, or take it to go."}
{"text":"Caveman burgers are good but expensive. The last time I was here my order was messed up and I went back the next day and my meal was replaced. I love the garlic and cheese fries. I'll be back in soon."}
{"text":"I visited Caveman Burgers last night with a friend and the burgers were tasty.  However:  if you are gluten free they do not offer any gf burger buns.  You can order a lettuce wrap but it is not wrapped up in waxed paper so that you can actually pick it up and eat it.  Very messy and inconvenient.  Also last night my friend and I both ordered sweet potato fries.  The fries they brought to our table were lukewarm, soggy and dark brown.  They did not taste good.  When my friend pointed this out, the waiter said that \"maybe\" he could cook us up one fresh order of the fries (we each had an order), or that he could place them back in the fry vat.  What?!  After he made the comment about the fry vat I realized that is probably why our fries were overcooked - because they were cooked earlier, then reheated in the fryer a second time and served to us.  When I took the fries back up to the counter and mentioned the problem, the person at the counter got me two fresh orders of sweet potato fries, which were quite good.  Why in the world we were served soggy twice cooked lukewarm fries in the beginning is beyond me.  Those things should have been thrown in the trash."}
{"text":"If you want a restaurant style burger meal and beer in a quick serve setting, this is your place. Try the beer battered Onion rings. I like all of the serving options and there are beef alternatives. My only complaint was that I found it expensive. I did upgrade quite a bit however and my recommendation to save is skip the pretzel bun. Soft but not as pretzel like as other places. They may have to consider specials to compete with the other options nearby. I will for sure be back to try other combos! The staff was super attentive in a non annoying manner and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Recently moved to town and was looking for a local favorite. Found this hidden gem on yelp! Walked in and immediately noticed the rustic decor. Went and placed the order and the owner explained to us the build your own burger concept which is totally awesome! I did the grass fed burger with regular bun and my girlfriend did the grass fed burger with a pretzel bun. We both did the CMD (something to that effect) sauce and that's DELICIOUS!!! If you're looking for a great atmosphere, friendly staff and one of the best burgers ever look no further!!!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome atmosphere! Customer service was terrific too. Best Burger I have probably ever had! The only issue is the cost and sides like Avocado, bacon and such are very costly! With the expensiveness won't be able to indulge to often! Will highly recommend though!"}
{"text":"Highly Recommended by some friends!   Good call!  Food was great ... Portions huge...service amazing! If you can pay it forward with a recommendation...Here ya go!  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Got delivery through Uber Eats from Caveman Burgers last night and was leery after a few of the reviews. That being said, the food was delicious! I got a Caveman turkey burger with cheddar on a pretzel bun and a side of fries, my friend got the Caveman Angus burger with cheddar and fries. By the time I asked my friend how the burger was, the reply I got was \"Gone.\" I think that says it all. The only things I wasn't much of a fan of were the CMB sauce and the fact that the turkey burger is an added charge, but the Alaskan Salmon isn't. How is that possible?!?! We both said we'd definitely get a burger again from there. If anything changes, I will be sure to update my review."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all of the 5 star reviews for this place. I live in the neighborhood and was excited to see a new place would be opening up. I ordered a grass fed burger wrapped in lettuce and an order of fries, and apparently they think that constitutes $13.00... I got my food to go and they didn't actually wrap the meat in the lettuce, they separated them, which was really annoying and lettuce wraps are hard enough to manage already, so having to put it all together myself was kind of difficult since I ordered to go and wasn't dining in. The fries tasted like any other fries out there, the beef didn't taste that great, and they wrapped it in ice berg lettuce, which again was really aggravating considering the price. They also didn't ask how I wanted my meat cooked so it was well done and chewy, which is rather annoying when you go out of your way to order grass fed.   I also felt sick after eating the food, which makes me assume that they use preservatives since the food has no seasonings or sauces, because they charge you extra for that, something else I have never seen at a quick serve place... Honestly, Five Guys across the street is ten times better and it's like $5 cheaper. I think this place is reaching a little too high on the price, especially for the taste and quality of the food. For that reason alone, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great new business! Excellent service, friendly staff, very clean. The food was amazing! I am currently stuffed on an Angus burger with a pretzel bun and their house dressing. Very good stuff! And SUPER filling for those with an appetite"}
{"text":"A bit pricy for a burger, but well worth it. #1 burger joint for sure. The staff was very helpful and involved. Was in the area on vacation."}
{"text":"Even in this era of gourmet burger aplenty, Caveman is unique and worth the while of burger seekers around the valley.  The meat is all angus. Grass-fed option for a dollar more. Eats like hamburger that was just ground, and I'm guessing they are.   All the options you can imagine. Chilis, various  cheeses, bun selections.   The sauce/dressing options were also on point. Along with all the usual condiments: Dijon(I can't stand when there's no Dijon), habanero catsup (not my style but interesting), barbecue, caveman sauce, ranch, and more.  Owner was working the register when I arrived to pick up my phone-in order. He was happy to accommodate me for a side of green chilis i forgot to order over the phone. Free of charge.   I only happened visit Caveman Burgers today bc my work required my presence on this side of town, however, I would happily make the commute  all the way from Scottsdale for burger like this."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, someone ahead of me was complaining about the price but it says gourmet burgers in the description. If you want gourmet you gotta pay."}
{"text":"Great local burger place, check out their social media for deals! Everything I've eaten was amazing, try their ranch."}
{"text":"Just so you know, Caveman Burger is a fast casual, counter service kind of place. That being said, the burger was pretty legit. They have many options for toppings, meat, and bread. The az grassfed beef was super tasty and the bacon and onion rings I put on top made it even better. My only complaint was that the burger fell apart a bit in my hand (to be fair, I did have a bunch of toppings). Further.... the garlic fries..... oh em gee.... this was insanely good. Get the fries. Don't question it, just do it."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. I got the Arizona Grass-fed Burger.. absolutely delicious! The quality of not only their burger but the rest of their food was phenomenal.  I have a corn allergy and when I mentioned it the guy that took our order (I think he was a manager) he let me know that their Sweet Potato fries have corn starch on them and that they are cooked in the same oil as the regular fries. It was so refreshing to go somewhere to eat and they are actually knowledgeable about their food especially to the extent that I need to know about with my food allergy.  I can tell that they take great pride in their food and their customer service. We were more than taken care of and took turns on checking on everyone that was there.  My boyfriend got onion rings on his grass fed burger and it looked so good! He let me taste one and they were delicious, perfect amount of crispy just like their fries.  I would recommend this to everyone I meat, great quality food for what really isn't that bad of a price."}
{"text":"1st way to over priced for what it is 2nd the burger I got was so salty I couldn't stand it. And the beer was way overpriced. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Now that's a tasty burger.  Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime. I can't usually get 'em myself because my girlfriend's a vegitarian which pretty much makes me a vegitarian. But I do love the taste of a good burger."}
{"text":"We went to Caveman Burgers for the first time today for my son's birthday as he said he wanted a hamburger. We didn't want a crappy chain burger joint and found this place on yelp. I'm so glad we did. The food was great and the service and employees were both fantastic and super nice. We don't live near the area but when I want a good burger I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This burger place is somewhere in the midpoint. Customer service was great. The burger are better than 5 Guys but not as good as some others. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Terrible. The worst burger and experience ever. Do not try. These reviews MUST be paid for. Try once and will Regret it! They just tried to kill me. I told them I CAN NOT under ANY circumstances have sugar, that I'm allergic and I would DIE. First they tried to offer me dressing on my side salad assuring me it didn't have sugar. It did and at the last minute someone saved me. Once they brought my lettuce wrapped burger, they added BBQ SAUCE. Yeah LOADED with sugar. I spit it out thank goodness and ran inside. Their \"system\" was down they couldn't refund us. So they paid us out cash never apologizing. It took 15 min to \"find\" a manager. My throats is swollen as heck and my husband says his only bite before I ran in to wash my mouth out was burnt to a crisp anyway and all bun. Terrible terrible terrible food, service, everything!!!   In response to the below apology.  Jeff you are ASKING for a lawsuit. I can't believe you are still in business this way. If I was remotely sue happy it would be my lawyer responding instead."}
{"text":"This place been open for about 5 months and does a very good job on their hamburgers, french fries and onion rings. Everything has made to order fresh produce, beef with a friendly helpful attentive staff. Definitely a good burger at a good value. The interior is clean and well maintained. If you're in the neighborhood check this out if you're looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"Great service and great burgers.  If you love a good burger, you must try....not your McDonald's burger, more compared to Smashburger.   Will surely come back!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Staff was friendly, and really helpful with their menu and giving recommendations. Their AZ grass-fed burger was really juicy, flavorful, and had the perfect cook to it. Even my 4 yr old, who doesn't eat of a lot of meat, devoured her burger. The dining area had a cool feel, and was nice and clean, however, the restroom was not. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"This is a follow up review and sadly, I think this was our last visit. One of the things that's literally hits you in the face is the smell in the parking lot. That shopping center (as well as Target across Bell) has a horrid sewer smell. It doesn't help that Village Inn's dumpster is directly outside the front door. We had 2 burgers (mine was lettuce wrapped, mustard, pickles, onions) I had no drink or fries. He had fries and med soda. We had our daughter with us, she got a kids meal with chocolate milk, they charged to add cheese to her kid's burger and to my disbelief....$28.00 (and that's after a veteran's discount!) Sorry, we gave it more than a few tries..."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, you can get local grass fed beef. The sweet potato fries are pretty tasty. I have eaten here a few times and not been disappointed. The workers have always had a very positive attitude as well and great customer service."}
{"text":"Rare that you can find grass fed meat in this part of town, even better they have wild caught salmon and any burger can easily be made into a salad. The price isn't far off from other quality burger joints. Finally a place I am comfortable bringing my family. Plus Monday nights kids eat free. I do recommend getting double meat if you're hungry though!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Sweet potatoes fries w/ brown sugar. Yum!  I got the pretzel bun w/ Angus, special sauce, toppings, etc - delicious!  Also, they have a vegan patty now for those who aren't carnivorous."}
{"text":"Found this while doing a family staycation at a nearby resort. We're a paleo family so we were delighted to find a place with local grass-fed beef, wild caught salmon, sweet potatoe fries and more! Plus, everything is customizable.   I had the Angus beef burger in a lettuce wrap with tomatoe, Swiss, sweet grilled onions, mayo and avocado slices, paired with fresh cut natural fries and an iced tea. My partner had the grass-fed Arizona beef burger on a gluten-free bun with lettuce, tomatoe and their special CMB sauce (described as salty-smokey-spicey). Everything was delicious, savory, juicy and we left happily full.   We would definitely recommend this to paleo people or anyone who enjoys a really excellent burger! Worth the drive if you're not in the north central Phoenix area!  Fresh baked bread, gluten-free/vegan buns or lettuce wraps. They also have a veggie bean burger for your non-carniverous friends :-)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch and there were hardly anyone eating here.  The restaurant is decorated nicely in a wood decor with the counter at the very back. Personally, I would have had the counter at the front with the seating in the back.  We ordered a few different things to give it a try being first time. We ordered the Angus Beef Burger, one with the Pretzel Bun with Fried Egg and the other Fresh Baked Bun. Also ordered a Turkey Burger along with Sweet Potato Fries, Fresh Cut Fries and Fresh Cut Beer Battered Onion Rings.   The Angus Burger was good size but with average taste,  I generally order a burger with Fried egg and Bacon and a Pretzel Bun is a bonus. This pretzel bun was ok and the burger together as a whole did not have the wow factor to it.  The sweet potato fries were good, the fresh cut fries were better, but the beer battered onion rings were a winner with an awesome crust.  As a warning as you add certain items, pretzel bun ($2) and fried egg makes your burger add up quickly. The \"Own It\" side is complimentary and the \"Specialize It\" is all extra $$.  I have my favorite burger places and this is not one of them."}
