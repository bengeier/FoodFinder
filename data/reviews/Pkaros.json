{"text":"Amazing service and great food! It was my first time trying Venezuelan food but I loved it :)"}
{"text":"Great location and service. The food was just awesome!!! They have burgers with a Venezuelan twist and much more. You have to try the Pepito and the ice cream! We are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit.

Charming and friendly service alongside authentic and delicious Venezuelan cuisine made with fresh ingredients. The newly renovated burger shop still offers a variety of burger choices, but now boasts an appetizing Venezuelan menu. I recommend adding some avocado sauce (always free) to enhance the flavours.

More than just a meal, they serve hot and iced coffees, fresh fruit smoothies, and made-in-house desserts."}
{"text":"Awesome.  There's this big buzz about bang bang ice cream and it actually doesn't come close to tasting as good as P'Karos Gelato,  especially the coffee flavored one. YUM!"}
{"text":"I have forgotten to review this place but I have been several times and I highly recommend it. I'm from Venezuela and I can say that this food is truly venezuelan. I have tried the arepas, parrilla and cachapas and they are exquisite. They also have lunch specials during the week and I have tried the asado negro and strogonoff and is very good. The soup deal is amazing. And finally the service is amazing, the people that work here are super nice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I like the Venezuelan selection, but the rest is meh...

The gourmet burgers can't be ordered a la carte and the combos are pretty pricey for what they are. With so many other gourmet burger joints around, they just don't stand out. Also, don't bother with the gelato. I watched one of the workers mixing up a batch with flavouring powder. It's gummy and tastes pretty awful. 

Stick to the Venezuelan menu and avoid setting yourself up for disappointment."}
{"text":"Very good service, delicious food, very clean. The pepito was a steak sandwich and the avacado sauce is a great addition. Would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service. All around a wonderful experience. Burgers and Venezuelan food? Sure! Gelato and smoothies? Yes, please! 

There's even some off menu stuff that I didn't get to try but I'll definitely be back to try more things.

We got the wild burger, blue burger, cheese epanadas, papaya smoothie and we thoroughly enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Pkaros on Yelp and thought we'd head over and try their burgers. The charming owner told us about a few of the Venezuelan specialties and persuaded us to try a couple instead of the burgers. The food was fresh, delicious and something we hadn't encountered before. We thought it was great. The restaurant is casual, bright, clean, fresh looking and very comfortable. The dishes were a bit slow in coming out but we reminded ourselves that everything is made fresh and from scratch. Definitely worth the wait. 
We even tried their house made gelato on the way out. Yum!
Luckily we live around the corner as we are sure to include Pkaros among our favourite local restaurants. 
Can't wait to bring our son who is a chef here. He'll love it."}
{"text":"On the Yonge St. stripe, its a nice welcome. The food was very good, the service was welcoming and attentive. The space is clean, cafe but canteen like. My only issue was the plastic cutlery. The entree price at around $12-16 is not cheap and came on white glass plates. But to cut meat with a plastic fork was impossible. There is a bit of an identity crisis here. 

But I will recommend trying the entree with cassava and specialities here. I will be back and hopefully some of the kinks get worked out."}
{"text":"If you are a foodie, you will find in this place some tropical fruits ice cream that are amazinngggg. (Guayana, Guanabana and passion fruit)."}
{"text":"I tried the Venezuelan eats at P'Karos and enjoyed the pulled pork arepas ($6.99) and the papellon ($3), a drink made of brown sugar, lemon and ice. They make the sauces and wrappers in- house and offer daily specials.

Now for things the restaurant can improve on. ..they need to decide what kind of restaurant they want to be. Their sign says P'Karos coffee, but the restaurant serves pricey burgers ($10 to $17), pizza, gelato....and Venezuelan food. Yes there's a coffee machine but the restaurant does not look like a coffee house or that they specialize in that. 

My Venezuelan friend was the one who recommended the resto to me for Venezuelan food, otherwise I would have not known passing by. The Venezuelan eats is only a small section on their menu."}
{"text":"I cannot in my wildest imagination understand how any sane person could rate P'karos with 4 stars or greater. In our experience it was pretty mediocre.

Wandering Yonge street looking for interesting dinner options, We too were intrigued by the idea of trying Venezuelan cuisine.

First don't be fooled. This is a fast food snack place not a restaurant. Complete with blaring sound track and. 24/7 TV.

Alas the Venezuelan offerings are very limited, about 7 options. The main choices are burgers. And not very good ones at that. While no one should ever expect a burger outside of home to be good (they all have to cook them to a sad grey death) they don't have to be frozen industrial hockey pucks.

amazingly little deep fries starters were both still room temperature in the middle. (and salty!? Wow!)

I was the only one to venture onto the V menu ordering the Patacon (i believe its called) pulled beef on fried plantane. Not bad but $13? Really? (and Venezuelans do not seem to be big on vegetables - there were nine in sight.) it was worth $7.

1 starter, 6nasty \"salty\" (that's how it is on the menu) cheese sticks, 2 burgers, my Vez. dish and a water and pop = $54. I can get mediocrely for half that.

Venezuelans must also like their food salty and this all filled the bill.

Interesting too the 2 adults suffered crushing headaches on returning home. MSG maybe?

On the positive side, The gelato was quite good. And the server very gracious in allowing us tastes.

But if P'karos is still around in 6 months i would be amazed."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place to enjoy everything!!! The food it's so delicious!! The coffee indescribably creamy!!! If you're from Venezuela you have to try they cachitos!!! OMG like the most famous bakery in our country!!!"}
{"text":"Just superb. Venezuelan mixed parrilla is amazing, just glorious! 

Plus, the place is all nice and lightened the attention is really good and all the waitress give you a nice smile. A+

Don't forget to have a 'Chicha' for drink, simply the best!"}
{"text":"Formally named Capitano's, It's not just a burger place anymore!
I recently stopped by Pkaros to check out the renovations and the updated menu.
There is still a good selection of burgers on the menu, but they now serve Venezuelan items! 
Everything is made in-house, including the bread and the gelato!

I tried the mixed meat pepito, it was delicious and one giant sandwich!
The chicken and beef mix was juicy, spicy, and tender.
The avocado sauce was sooo good!

I didn't have room for dessert but the the dulce de leche cake looked delicious. The baked goods change here daily.

The arepas (pancake + meat) was popular here and so were the fries (almost like Latin American poutine!)

If you like croissants, the cachitos are ham and cheese pastries perfect for breakfast.

The service here was warm and friendly. I had a great experience here and Pkaros is one of my favourite spots to grab a bite in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If you are curious or nostalgic about Venezuelan food you might want to try P'karos!  The two hours I spent there brought lots of memories from my childhood and my time at the university. My 'regression' started with the very friendly welcome from the owner -just like in my country.  It was really hard to pick a few items from the menu when I actually wanted to try them all, so my family and I decided to have a 'full Venezuela immersion'. My favourite were the \"Cachapa\" (Corn-base pancake) and the \"Yuca frita\" (Fried cassava) as they exactly tasted as in Caracas, my home city.  Check the 'Cachito de Jamon' (Ham cachito) too... It reminded me of the time my mom used to get me a Cachito before heading to my school! Would you like to try a typical Venezuelan Summer drink? Try their \"Papelon con Limon\" which is basically sugar and lemon... so refreshing and DELICIOUS.  Let's talk desserts now. I went back to a dilemma mode again after trying several options for gelato: Ron-Pasa, Parchita, Mango...OMG. I finally picked Parchita and had 0 regrets! But wait, P'karos and us are not done yet. We will go for the Arepas (Cornmeal bread) soon!."}
{"text":"We came to p'karos last night for trying their Venezuelan food, it was amazing. We ordered parrilla with yuca frita and cachapas with cheese and meat, both of the dishes were perfectly cooked, we also ordered chicha and papelon con limon, they just reminded me of the food back home. Also the staff is really friendly and helpful, I will go back to this restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  We were looking for just a quick bite to eat, and discovered P'Karos while just wandering by. My fiancee had the 'Aprepa de Pollo', and I had the Pina Burger.  The portions were huge, and absolutely delicious.  For a lunch, it was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"I took some friends to this place hoping to show them some good Venezuelan food (I grew up in Venezuela). I was disappointed. The arepa reina pepiada wasn't good. The tequeños were a bit burnt, and very expensive. I really wanted to like this place, but maybe it was just a bad day for the cook? Maybe I'll give it a second chance in the future."}
{"text":"This place use to be burger and gelato  until recently when it became pkaros after several months of  renovation. 

The interior has an orange and white motif with wood tones that are reminiscent  of the old capitanos. 

There is a gelato bar and a selection of deserts, macaroons, cakes, etc.

The burger was substantial in quantity. The taste was pretty good, for $15 I would expect something top notch."}
{"text":"I went here one night when I was walking and I saw a Venezuelan flag. Of course I went inside to see what they make but I was too full so my friend and I (both Venezuelans) ordered tequeños and a tres leches desert. The tequeños were just acceptable and the tres leches was extremely sweet. We couldn't finished it and we tried very hard to eat the tequeños too. 

The place is nice, new, clean and modern, but the servers weren't super friendly. They looked tired and without motivation. I now it was late and they were probably tired, but common! A positive attitude is necessary when dealing with customers!

I wish I wasn't full that night so I tried real food. Now, with my sad experience, I'd probably just continue going to El Gordo Ex when I crave Venezuelan food."}
{"text":"I went here a few times when it was Capitano's. This evening was my first visit since they changed the inside/menu etc.

I played it safe with a burger from their old menu, but I'd go back to try the Venezuelan dishes.

The interior looks new and clean. The staff are all polite and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had! Staff was so nice and helpful. I will definitely be back to try some of the more authentic items on the menu."}
{"text":"Never had Venezuelan food before and I must say, this place definitely gave Venezuelan food a good impression. We had the taquenos and empanada as starters and they were really good.  Not to greasy as I expected, and had the perfect crunch. 

I then ordered the cassava with beef and chicken. I don't remember the name of the food but it was the last item on the menu. It was great, the fried cassava definitely made it taste different in a good way. We also got the plantain with pulled pork (patacon) and it was great. All bold flavours.  Lastly, the best one yet...but I forgot the name...was the pancake texture (I believe it's made of corn) with beef inside. That was amazing lt had a touch of sweetness and mixed with the meat, it was magical. 

I will definitely come here again for more of that Guac sauce though!  Best thing there is and made everything taste 100 times better!"}
{"text":"Decided to try on a whim. Decent food and friendly staff...a little pricey for what you are getting considering it wasn't that much. The fried yuca was on point, hands down...and their green sauce on the table is like crack, lather that on EVERYTHING! The beef was a little lacking in both flavour and preparation...overcooked and under seasoned. Overall didn't regret the experience."}
{"text":"New concept after they were shut down for a couple months and changed their name......and what an improvement!!!! . They have about 10 different types of burgers and house made fried and onion rings and food from Venezuela !!!! WOW amazing !!! 

They have a daily lunch special which is a huge meal of homemade soup, rice, mashed potatoes, cooked plantain and chicken or beef in a sauce....... Too big for lunch except the 6 construction workers a in front of me ordered it 

We ordered the wild burger which is house made with caramelized onions, mushrooms, goat cheese & peppers with a drink called papelon which over ice is soooo refreshing. And the fish burger with fries. 

The place is small in the seating area - the kitchen and prep area with the gelato counter takes up allot of space. They had tables made with ribbonwood laminate (nice) and accent them with some plastic orange and white chairs. The walls are simple and just paint with two MASSIVE LCD Screens. Latin music plays rather loud and all the talking the place is loud. You have to speak loud to hear the person  your eating with.  with about 12 tables and the decor is very simple - no real design actually

The fries were amazing - arrived nice and hot and ever so good. They have this \"green sauce\" they make that is like avocado cream - OMGosh is that good when you dip fries into it !! The burgers were both great, in house made buns and just the toppings were fantastic ! 

Will return here for sure - next time going to try the Latin dishes !"}
{"text":"The place looks amazing, but I think their taking advantage of the renovation and location. Me and my wife spend $44 on two papelón, a hamburger,  one salad (which I found too expensive for what it is and how much it's served), a cachapa and and extra of cheese ($3.39 per two slices, really?) . I was worth it? I dont think so. We had a OK experience but I think we'll not return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both Venezuelan food virgin. We stumbled upon this place and decided to pop our cherries. 

Upon entering, we were asked if we were first timer and we told the guy yes so he explained everything on the menu, everything! He made me hungry just by the way he was so passionate about his food. 

Anyway, we tried the tequenos (cheese sticks), pepito, and (I forgot the name, sorry but it was on the very last page). 

Tequenos were delicious on its own or with some guacamole or lots! 

Pepito was good too. I got mixed meat, a generous amount of chicken and beef. It was a little messy to eat but it was satisfying! 

The dish on the last page of the menu, my bf got mixed meat as well and the side option he picked fried cassava. He found the beef to be very salty but the cassava was perfect - lightly fried and well-seasoned. 

The service was amazing too. The servers were polite and friendly. I'd definitely go back to try their breakfast food :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers, delicious and authentic Venezuelan food, and fantastic gelato.  The service is personable and attentive and the decor is spacious and bright. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent home made food. I just ate a dish that they call \"pabellon criollo\" that is a typical Venezuelan dish. It has shredded meat, rice, black beans and fried sweet plantain. Everything was so tasty! And price was not bad for a full homemade dish. 

Place is neat and clean and staff is very nice and friendly. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I thought this was just a burger joint... But I was so excited to find that this is an AMAZING Venezuelan restaurant. Huge portions, authentic, fresh and soooo delicious. Our family of from Colombia... And this is good Latin American food!"}
{"text":"Gelato review

With their gelato sign projected onto the sidewalk of Yonge Street, how can I not come in for an after dinner dessert? The place was modern, clean, and all orders were done at the front. 

I sampled strawberry and dark chocolate and decided on the dark chocolate gelato which was extremely rich, creamy, fudgey and delicious. Kinda like McDonald's sundae fudge sauce-cold, sweet, melts in your mouth but 100 times better! Would definitely recommend if you're a chocolate addict.  

I also tested almond and Oreo flavours from my boyfriend's cup which was also really good! Recommend the almond more because I love a strong almond taste. 

One scoop came to $5.xx and two scoops came to about $6.xx which is a little pricey for the amount given, considering marble slab's huge one scoop with unlimited mixins is less than $6."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try South American food, and this was the first time I ever ate Venezuelan food and it was so good. This place is so underrated! The restaurant was clean as well as the washrooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was served in big portions and was priced reasonably. The food was full of flavour and they do not skim on the meat ;) I enjoyed the guacamole sauce they had at every table. It was so delicious and went well with my order to add extra flavour to every spoonful."}
{"text":"If you want to eat something amazing you should ask for the Pepito!!!! I love it! Actually the food in this place is very nice! My husband ordered an arepa which is a Venezuelan cornmeal sandwich with cheese inside and it was very tasty! Definitely I recommend this place 100%!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, however the service is a different story.

Ordered 1 tequeño and 1 arepa, got charged for 8 tequeños and 1 arepa, which is an $8 difference. The menu doesn't list prices of arepas so i assumed it was super expensive when the cashier told me what I owed Once I sat down and later on got served 8 tequenos I understood they had charged me wrong and told them. The server said sorry but nothing was done about it. The homeless sitting around the corner got lucky that day.

The arepa was really good, the tequeños not so much. All my friends loved their arepas as well.

Other than that I self served myself to everything else as service was very slow and there were not that many people on a Sunday at noon."}
