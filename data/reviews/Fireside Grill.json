{"text":"We ate here and the environment was stale. Food was not good. Ordered a steak tasted like it had freezer burn"}
{"text":"I really didn't expect much from this place, since Fountain Hills has an unfortunate shortage of good eats. (not saying that there aren't good places, just that they are few in number)  Anyways, I had a feta and walnut salad with a vinagerette.  It looked nice, but the taste was something else entirely.  They used iceburg lettuce that it tasted like it was out of a Fresh Express Bag.  There was also so much feta that it would have been overpowering had it not been for the sickeningly sweet vinagerette.  The place does have a view of the fountain if you are there for the tourist thing, but I would recommend going across the street to Euro Pizza.  Euro Pizza sits right on the edge of Fountain Park and has pretty decent eats."}
{"text":"When vacationing in the metro Phoenix area, we always take a drive out to lovely Fountain Hills to enjoy watching the fantastic fountain amidst the lake which shoots into the air usually once hourly on the hour for about 15 minutes.  We like to view the show from a window table in the Fireside Grill restaurant in Holiday Inn while enjoying a good lunch or dinner.  The Grill offers a menu with a variety of choices so one can count on finding something to please every taste.  Service is prompt and friendly.  On our most recent visit, my wife and I both chose the Chicken Fireside which included salad and vegetable selection.  On past visits, the food has been A+ perfect but this time we were disappointed to find the chicken was tough so I felt I should deduct one star.  Our very nice waiter treated us to chocolate cake to make amends.  We will definitely return next time we are on vacation and highly recommend eating here.  Portions are large and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast during the Thanksgiving Day Parade. Drinks were served about 15 minutes after ordering - mine came out wrong. I didn't bother telling the server.  We waited literally 30 minutes more to order, being quite patient since clearly they were understaffed. After several unsuccessful attempts to waive down any server we left $10 on the table to cover out tea and coffees and got up and left.  Appalling customer service, can't say we'll be back. Bummer too because the patio has a nice view of the fountain and mountains."}
{"text":"Great looking place, the food was OK and the service was below borderline.  Went in for their breakfast, seated quickly got our beverages (ice tea and coffee) came quickly as well.  The food was... OK, but my breakfast companions eggs which were order over medium came with runny whites, and the \"hot and ready biscuit\" on their menu was like a brick.    I do not know if our server was just having a bad day, but she seemed rushed and primary concern was anything but waitressing.  She was non-existent after just dropping our plates off at the table and we could hear her talking with someone else about txt'ing schedule changes.  This conversation went on for 10 minutes at least, at no point did she come back to check on us or refill drinks.    We waited another 15 minutes for our server to reappear and mentioned the rock hard biscuit, which she comp'd our drinks (a small carafe of coffee and a large ice tea which were $5!!!) on the ticket.  I appreciate the customer service at the end but it was a little too late.  Food was nothing to be excited about, beverages over-priced and the staff inattentive, will not be going back."}
{"text":"The Fireside Grill consistently has good food and great service with a wonderful outdoor patio that overlooks Fountain Park.  We really enjoy sitting out on the patio with friends and watching the town's signature fountain, which at it's full height is 560 feet.  What a sight!  The menu is extensive so whether you are a meat eater or a vegetarian like myself, there is something for everyone.  There is also a full bar!  They have a great happy hour and live music on some nights.  I would highly recommend the Fireside Grill."}
{"text":"Phil made sure our special event yesterday the 17th of May was very nice.  The food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went for a soda and to relax after street fair.  Server seemed frustrated that we didn't want to order food.  Took a looong time to refill soda.  Not many in restaurant.  Couple at table next to us ordered meatball sub and crab cakes.  Cakes were perfectly round and exact same size, as if from a frozen package.  Meatball sub had potential but came out with ripped hoagie and meatballs and sauce running out side.  Messy.  Then manager(?) came over and joked that you just can't trust servers with your credit cards.  He was kidding, but wasn't nice to say in front of his server.  We will NOT be back..."}
{"text":"I am singularly unimpressed with this place. I've lived in town for four years and for some reason I keep trying this place hoping one day it will change into a place that sells good food at reasonable prices.  Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over expecting different results?   Easter Brunch: $29 and pretty much completely tasteless. I don't mean the people were rude or the colors clashed, I mean the food had no flavor.   Unless someone else buys this place and turns it into a restaurant I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant! The only reason we even tried this restaurant was because we had an Entertainment Book coupon. We were a bit hesitant when we arrived as there was only one party on the patio and the whole restaurant was empty, a bit surprising as the art show just ended and you would have thought it would be packed! However, we decided to stay as the view is nice. Service was good. We had drinks and each ordered an entree. We put our coupon in with our credit card and the server came back and apologetically informed us that the new owner refused to honor our coupon. I could understand if the restaurant had changed names, but that wasn't the case. Needless to say we will never go back due to the way this was handled and his lack of business is a direct result of his poor business ethics!"}
{"text":"Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. There was only 2 other couples seated at the time. We were seated after about a 10 minute wait, got our menus, waited another 10 minutes for our order to be taken. Got our drinks, waited another 15 minutes for the food and drink refills to arrive. Would have given them 2 stars, but the food was good. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"First clue was no one in restaurant. Dinner rolls were burnt and Chicken Parmesan was overcooked. Out of 4 of us at the table ... No one liked their dinner. One friend who is vegan asked for plain noodles with veggies. They accommodated, but then topped it with cheese (not vegan). #fail"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant I have been to in Arizona. They got my order wrong twice and then they got the price wrong. All of which happened on my first time going there. Never again will I go back. After getting the order wrong the first time the waiter had the nerve to argue with me and tell me that that was in fact what I had ordered. How would he know when i originally had a waitress who for some unknown reason was changed to a waiter. When I asked about the switch I wasn't given an answer, I got the feeling it was because the waitress didn't like the color of my skin. It seemed like this place doesnt like minorities at all. Horrible expierence that I never want to go through again."}
{"text":"I should have written this a long time ago but forgot. You can see from the photo that my English muffin was burnt on this plate of eggs Benedict. What you can't see is that the eggs themselves were hard. You couldn't cut through the burnt muffin with a knife and the ham was dry and tough. What you can see is that there wasn't enough hollandaise but what you can't tell is that it had an odd taste.  Strangely, this dish was both burnt and cold.   Store bought burnt potato bites and a sad orange slice. Just look at that plating. I could even forgive that if the chef wasn't supposedly \"certified cordon blu\" (for profit culinary school, Scottsdale (now defunct)).   Even the coffee was bad.   All that aside, and I would still give this place 2 stars but it took almost an hour to get served and the place only had one or two other tables dining."}
{"text":"Over priced poor quality just Bad food / the bad service is either young kids who seem to be more on vacation than actually doing there job to tired looking waitresses that look like they would be happier having a smoke in the bathroom to a Latino guy that just seems so out of place you wonder what kind of scam are they running in this place - Do your self a favor and stat away from this place ..."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Fireside for a cold beer and some appetizers. We ordered potatoe skins and artichoke dip and 2 beers. Well we got the cold beer and by the time the appetizers came the beer was drank 45 minutes later we where ready to walk out. There was another table of 4 people that got their beer and no one ever came back to them to take their order they drank their beer and walked out. There were tables that had not been cleared off that I'm sure had been sitting for hours. The potato skins were okay nothing special and the artichoke dip not that good. WE WILL NOT GO BACK THERE."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Fireside Grill this past week.  We each ordered a ribeye steak, salad, french onion soup, and a vodka cranberry.  The horror show night started out with an incredibly inexperienced waitress that frankly had no business attending to patrons.     Positive: The drinks were strong.  Negatives:  1. The salad: Nothing to write home about.  It seemed like the salad premixes that you buy at the grocery store that are never fresh.  2. The soup: Mediocre, nothing special.  3. The ribeye: The steaks took the cake.  My wife and I were expecting nice juicy rib eyes and they brought out some kind of strip steak that you would expect to see at a crappy diner with your eggs for breakfast.  We ordered large 14oz rib eyes and were served steaks that couldn't even have weighed 4 ozs and each being no thicker than a nickel. It was so shocking that without giving it a second thought I told the waitress that there was something wrong and that we ordered rib eyes.  Her answer was unreal, \"This is all we have tonight.\"  After complaining to the waitress and the manager I figured they would try to do something nice for us, however, they decided to add insult to injury and did absolutely nothing.  The meal cost over $60.  I really hate writing a 1 star review, but this place needs to be put out of its misery.  The location is amazing looking out at the fountain and a good restaurant could really thrive here."}
{"text":"I recently worked with Phil and his team at the Fireside Grill to plan and host a memorial reception for my sister. They were an amazing team to work with. They set everything up exactly as I had hoped and were very accommodating to our guests.  The menu was Italian as that was a favorite of my sister's and the Tiramisu was an excellent end to the meal. The price was very reasonable and the service staff were exceptional.  If you are planning a luncheon or dinner reception I highly recommend the Fireside Grill."}
{"text":"Loved happy hour . Great Friday night entertainment.  Great food and can't wait to home back.  Can't believed it took me so long to come in!!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Monday morning around 9:00am. They had a couple of tables but wasn't extremely busy. We waited about 5mins to be seated, nobody was working the floor. A lady showed from the kitchen and told us to sit wherever we wanted that she will follow. Long story short, we were at the table good 10mins and nobody came to serve us. The phone was ringing nonstop and nobody answered. We spotted another couple that was there before us with not even coffee at their table yet. About 5 more minutes after, they decided to leave and the server came to our table for the order. We asked her if the orders were taking long and she honestly told us:yes, I have 3 orders before you...(and they had only 4 tables besides us!) They are not prepared to serve and seems like they actually don't care. Too bad for such a premium location!!! If you are a guest at the hotel, don't have a vehicle, and feel that there is no option, do yourself a favor and walk across the street and go to Euro Pizza. They have a great breakfast with reasonable price and great service. That's what we did!"}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY.  Tonight we enjoyed the chicken and fish tacos for ONLY $2 each !!!They were fresh and delicious. Both were served with green and red house made salsa. We added beans and rice to have a great meal. For dessert we had the Cherry Crisp and it was enough to share with lots of cherries, crumbles and vanilla ice cream. Don't forget to order the Fountain Breeze-Tini  only $5 every hour on the hour when the fountain is going off.  The service was great, the restaurant is very comfortable and welcoming. It may be hot outside, but it is cool at the Fireside Grill."}
{"text":"Great Locally owned and run restaurant with unsurpassed views! They have the best onion soup on the planet and their Rib Eye Steak is cooked to perfection. They steam their veggies with just a bit of Olive Oil.. so healthy and delicious.. Don't let reviews scare you this is a wonderful local dining option. Their desserts are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck! I had a chicken wrap and it was very dry!!! Chicken seemed like it was frozen before and it was burnt!  Service was ok and the booth is sat in was very broken in! I had to sit on the wooden bar in the middle so I didn't sink in! The long island iced tea was very stiff!"}
{"text":"My breakfasts this morning at Fireside Grill was very good. This morning I again enjoyed my favorite California Omelet loaded with bacon, cheese and avocado. Fireside Grill is located within the Holliday Inn Fountain Hills, AZ. The service is always welcoming and the view of the World Famous Fountain, Lake and Park is tough to top in downtown Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio at this place by the fountain. It was a beautiful early evening. Had a great meal at a reasonable price and had the lovely view to boot!  Service was excellent. Being on the property of the hotel makes it even better for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"The appeal of the restaurant makes you think the food is going to be horrid.. But yet it was amazing! I think they really need to get a makeover on the restaurant. The prices were fantastic too! The food was great, cooked perfectly. The chicken fried steak was crispy and delicious. They just need to work on the look of the place!"}
{"text":"09/06/12  The floors and tables had crumbs all over. Paint was peeling from the ceiling. Was I still inside the Holiday Inn? It did not seem so.  I ordered the \"low carb south of the border style\"  The salsa tasted terrible. The avocado \"slivers\" we're already brown, yet we're the best part of the meal. The grilled chicken was unspeakable, and so dry I thought it was a freeze dried concoction made for a space mission to Mars. I tried to eat the eggs, and they were about the same as McDonalds in taste/quality/texture. I suppose the cheese on the eggs was decent. The meal definitely should have been 4.99 and not 8.99.  The OJ tasted like SunnyD, which I guess isn't bad but for 3.29?  I was tempted by the photos of a beautiful lamb shank on the posters on the elevator. (those are 29.99) I wanted to try them, but if they can't get grilled chicken, avocado and eggs right, I'm going to skip and head to the grill across the street or the Puerto Rican place nearby instead.  I should have listened to yelpers - shame on me."}
{"text":"New ownership! We were passing through to Northern California and found this gem. Everything is home made, no frozen! Both dinner and breakfast was awesome. I suggest everyone try it!"}
{"text":"We came here every year for Spring Training and love this place.  Great food and the view of the Fountain is awesome.   At least stop by and have a drink."}
{"text":"My wife and I were seated quickly and had our menus and glasses of house merlot in very short order. The merlot, while not served at the proper temperature, was fruity and fairly quaffable at $4.50 a glass.   My wife had chicken parmigiana that was certainly better than my prime rib special. A chain saw would have been the appropriate cutting device for the prime rib; however, our waiter, Luis, brought another piece of beef that was considerably better. The pasta dish was tender and had a wonderful sauce.   The restaurant's ambiance was enhanced by a  singer with a very pleasant voice singing country songs...songs that must have detailed every bucolic God-forsaken city in Texas, Oklahoma, and Lousey-ana. Still, though, the people in the restaurant enjoyed the songs, even the quaint folks married 62 years who were celebrating their anniversary with champagne. The elderly gentleman accompanied the musician by playing along vicariously with some spoons."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch with my two sons, my brother, and his family. The place was big and had a neat looking interior, but we decided to eat outside. The waitress was not too attentive despite how dead it was. I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich. It took longer than 20 minutes to get our food, and to be honest, I was not impressed. The bbq sauce was nothing special and the brisket was dry. The French fries, however, were pretty good. My sons split a hamburger off the kids menu. It was not very impressive either.  We considered leaving but didn't want to spend the time changing restaurants. We all made the comment that we will not be returning, and I can not in all honesty recommend this place."}
{"text":"I finally have the time to leave a review for this terrible restaurant. I was at fireside a little bit ago and had the unfortunate luck of ordering the hamburger. What I got was an undercooked mess. I ordered and even reiterated that I would like my hamburger cooked medium and what I got could only be described as well done with a raw center. Only at fireside could you get a burger cooked that defies the law of physics. I am not even sure how it is possible to cook a hamburger both well done and raw at the same time. The waitress did the best she could given the quality of meat and the skills of the cooks. Complaining to the manager was a waste of time and effort. Run away and never look back."}
{"text":"#104 I arrived at the Fireside Grill after a really HOT day in Arizona last May (yes, it took me a bit to post my review).  I was looking for something refreshing and comforting to relieve me from this tough, hot, steamy day.  A friend suggested the Fireside Grill in Fountain Hills.  Sounds great.  We entered the place and the bartender/manager Louis greeted us in a super friendly manner, welcoming my group to the establishment.  We took a seat at the open bar area and began watching TV--they were showing the Baltimore situation as it unfolded.  Louis asked me what would I like to drink as I looked over the menu.  I ordered a drink and began to ask Louis about the menu.  He offered several suggestions; however, I (and my companions) decided on a few items:  The Southwest Chicken Salad The Cobb Salad The Pasta and Meatballs  The Southwest Chicken Salad was incredible.  It was served in a toasted tortilla bowl with beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, olives, avocado, and sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side.  The Cobb salad was good, not amazing.  This salad was replete with tiny chunks of turkey, bacon, thinly sliced egg, fresh blue cheese and whatever dressing we chose.  It was a large portion, but kinda boring.  Finally, we had the penne pasta and meatballs with marinara sauce.  This pasta dish came with garlic bread layered with melted cheese and a small side salad.    The place is clean, and open, looking out onto a pool and the valley.  Live music was preset with a singer.  Many regular guests were there as Louis knowingly greeted several customers as they arrived.  The service from Louis was impeccable.  He was attentive, friendly and informative.    Stephani Smiles for Fireside Grill ;)"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast menu is excellent. My favorite was the cinnamon french toast! The floors and tables were spotless and the whole room had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food - best Eggs Benedict I've ever had! Biscuits and gravy was too spicy for us. Good service, nice atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 stars button. I read some reviews on Facebook about this place so we finally decided to try it. First, The menus are pieces of paper stapled together. Really really cheesy. Then we had to wait about 10 minutes for somebody to come acknowledge us at the table. Then everything just went downhill from there. I had to ask repeatedly for more ice tea, and I asked for extra ice and it never came. I finally got my ice about 15 minutes later.  We ordered the regular size Caesar salad, and it came on a teeny tiny plate. We were really turned off by that and asked how they could serve an $8 salad on a tiny little plate. They didn't seem to have the answers but they did bring us a 2nd salad for free. Can't really screw up a salad, so that was at least good. My boyfriend ordered chicken tenders and fries. He said they were nothing special at all. And they were served on a bed of hard fries, for $10. By the way, the plates that they serve here are really really cheesy. Looks like something they picked up at Goodwill for God's sake.  I ordered chicken marsala on a bed of linguine. Sounds fancy right? Well it should be and and then some, for 21 freakin dollars! When they brought out my plate, I was so shocked. There was a little tiny baby piece of chicken sitting on top of the nastiest looking linguine I've ever seen in my entire life. On a tiny little goodwill plate. The chicken tasted like dog shit. It was awful, it tasted like it was frozen and then microwaved. And the linguini was beyond disgusting. It even had an odor to it. I only took one bite and that was it. It was super super nasty. I would not feed this food to my worst enemy for God's sake. I don't even think prisoners eat this bad.  I am beyond shocked that this plate was $21. Disgusting disgusting disgusting. To serve such shitty food in a hotel is really really a bad bad sign. I've been to a million hotels in my life, and they've always had 5 star food! This is a joke. They should be really ashamed of themselves. We will never ever come back here."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! If you're deciding between here and American sports bar across the street, this restaurant is far superior! Great service & great food! 10/10"}
{"text":"Great food, and for germaphobes like me, the restaurant was incredibly spotless and clean. Will definitely be coming back ."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a wedding and stopped at the bar area between the wedding and reception.  Nice cozy atmosphere, and I heard live music in the main dining area but was too far away to enjoy it.  Bartender was friendly and professional, fast service.  I saw a plate of nachos that I really wish I could have had to time try, but unfortunately we were too rushed.  Compared to other places in the area, I would say this would be one of the nicest places in Fountain Hills for dinner. Would definitely try it next time I'm in the area, especially for the nachos I'm still craving!!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. The coffee was not vey good and the  \"eggs\" did not look or taste like real eggs. Someone ordered sausage I'm my group and Saud It was tasteless. My bacon and bagel were fine but overall disappointing and seemed expensive for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday which was Italian night and they offered \"bread/rolls, salad, pasta dish and ice cream\" for $12.99. We sat outside and had a view of the fountain going off. There was someone smoking while eating outside which we weren't a fan of- but that's not the restaurants fault, and we were far enough away from them we couldn't smell it. The proportions were big and tasted decent! The service was good- our waitress was very nice. Quick service too. We had our salad and rolls at the same time, and got our main dish before finishing our salads. They have happy hour on drinks as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in there despite the less than stellar reviews because they had outside seating and would allow our 4 legged kiddo!  Much to our surprise, the view was superb, the patio clean and well kept, server was timely and friendly (without being asked our dog was brought fresh water)!!!  The food was above average and we would be repeat customers if we lived closer.  Thank you Diane!!"}
