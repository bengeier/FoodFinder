{"text":"These people will rip you off. I live next door and they will not honor the coupon they delivered to me.  They have shorted my order more and more as their business is failing.  Stay away from this place as there is much better pizza at a much better price than this available all over the neighborhood. This place will be for rent again in a few months."}
{"text":"We order from here about once a week. The prices are great for the portion sizes. I can get two meals out of any of the pasta dinners. The best sauce I have ever had! They put so much cheese on their meals and it's amazing! I recommend this to every one I know."}
{"text":"I have not a clue about what the others are saying about the owners.... Two of the nicest people ever. I order from here at least twice a week and they have some of the best sauce and garlic butter. I order and my food is ready for pick up within 15 minutes. They're one of only places that even has garlic butter anymore. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"I've had trouble finding decent pizza near my North Side neighborhood. Some are okay, others are terrible. This is the best I've found so far.   I found them on Yelp and, without a menu, called and ordered a large cheese pizza for delivery. The guy who took my order didn't speak the best English but he was polite and patient as I kept asking him to repeat himself.  The total was less than $10 which I was happy about. The pizza came about fifteen minutes late but the driver apologized and was very friendly.  Seriously though, the sauce is damn good. I hate cheap sauce and most places dump tons of sugar or corn syrup into theirs, but this sauce is fresh and savory. The crust doesn't have that post-frozen taste and the cheese was a notch above average.  All in all, I'm sure I'll order from them again."}
{"text":"We moved to Brighton Heights 18 months ago and have tried several places in the area. This is my wife's favorite. We get the same pizza every time, Cerasoli Special with her half less the bacon and sausage.   Fresh ingredients and a lovely staff. After seeing the pictures I'll get a Chicago style next time.   I always pick it up so it's ready in 15 minutes.  I don't think it's fair to give a poor review due to delivery so in my mind the place gets a better rating overall than what Yelp shows."}
{"text":"Oh my God I can't believe this place isn't busier. I love the two old people that work there and probably own the place they make really really good food"}
{"text":"This place was recommend to me by another northsider as we were discussing lack of good pizza in our area.  I ordered a deep dish pepperoni and buffalo fries with bacon and cheese.  The pizza was heavy, because it is Chicago style, but tasty.  Not quite up there with true Chicago pizza, but good.  The fries were seasoned and covered in a fabulous amount of melted white cheese.  Based on the melt I was guess a mozz and provolone mix.  Portions are good for the price.  Online ordering is through GrubHub whether you do delivery or pick up."}
{"text":"Cerasoli is good pizza.  Their delivery times were slow at first, but they've gotten much better. I think that's why they have a low rating.  I love that i can order from within the yelp app too. Helps me organize my thoughts."}
{"text":"Best pizza sauce that I have ever had! Generous portions, extensive menu, good prices and it is very clean!  This all adds up to being my new favorite place for lunch! The wings are fresh, all of the ingredients are fresh, there is no skimping on toppings either!  You owe it to yourself to try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a mushroom pie for my mom one night while she was at my house. I decided to try this place out after searching Yelp and seeing how close it is to my house. My mom couldn't stop talking about how good the pizza was! Fast forward to last weekend. I ordered a pizza online and picked it up about 15 minutes later. The shop is the cutest. An elderly couple is actually in the kitchen making the food! When I saw that, I knew my pizza was going to be good! Cerasoli did not disappoint! The pizza was hot but not too greasy (just enough to make it good pizza ;) and there was a good perfect amount of cheese on it. I definitely found my \"go-to\" spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"Go for the food; wait, and wait, and wait for the delivery.  Pizza is always hit or miss in Pittsburgh--mostly \"miss.\"  I hate to sound like NY-centric pizza snob, but if that's who I have to be, that's who I'll be.  I need to look out for the East Coast transplants to the 'burgh.    The pizza and hoagies are pretty good.  The pizza is doughy, so if that's your thing, this is your place.  The hoagies, likewise, are better than your average pizza place in Pittsburgh, and certainly better than most spots on the North Side.  My biggest complaint is that Cerasoli doesn't have their own delivery drivers, but use GrubHub instead.  I can respect that is probably a financial decision, but this is why I'm only giving it two stars.  I've ordered delivery from them twice over the past two weeks.  The first time, it took two hours to get my order delivered.  Last week, and this is the last time that I'll order from them, it took more than three hours.  Again, I blame GrubHub, but again, it makes it too inconvenient for me to want to order from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza delivery around 10:30 pm. However, didn't receive pizza after hours and couldn't call the restaurant to check status. STILL MISSING PIZZA. I already PAID online"}
{"text":"I ordered garlic fresh wings and a steak hoagie. The hoagie was a good size , with a fair amount of toppings. Kinda sloppy and it made the lettuce too wet to enjoy. The wings were large and they were generous with the sauce. I also ordered one slice of pepperoni pizza and it was Large. The cheese was thick and juicy and there were a lot of pepperoni and the dough was thick. Overall i would order from there again."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro salad and received exactly that: a gyro on top of a salad (pita and all). They made a gyro, sliced it, and placed it on some lettuce an tomatoes. No flavor, little meat, and slightly expensive for what it was.  I would not recommend this menu item."}
{"text":"I could not taste the pizza.  It never arrived.  After an hour, I called and was told the driver just left and it would be 10 minutes.   After another 20 minutes, I was told the driver had a flat.  I cancelled my order and thankfully got a full refund through Eat24.  I also recommended Eat24 not partner with this Pizza Shop anymore."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first but I ordered the deep dish with sausage and pepperoni along with cajun wings......wings were crispy and spicy like I like them.  Pizza was very flavorful and filling. It was the first time I've had Chicago style deep dish and I'm a fan,of it now"}
{"text":"I have finally found a good pizza to order from in Brighton Heights. I stumbled upon a Chicago Deep Dish w/ pepperoni and OMG.  The pizza is not too deep or doughy and the crust is very nice.  At first I thought they forgot the pepperoni but it was in the cheese!!!  Yes in the cheese apparently where it should be was also very nice.  And finally the sauce, holy amazing gravy.  Fresh on top with a tiny spice kick to awaken the taste buds, and this was better than very nice.   Delivery was slow, but good things come... well Yinz know the rest.  I will be ordering this again for quite some time."}
{"text":"Great sauce!  I'm not usually a fan of pizza sauces but they have the best sauce on their deep dish pizza which I may add a small deep dish is enough to feed 4 grown men.  Owner seams like a nice guy even delivered me a order personally.    Bbq wings are also good.....I would recommend you to try this place.  By the way a small deep dish is only 9 dollars and 12 wings are 9 dollars which are cheap for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza with my co-worker. We both agree that is top-notch. Delicious sauce and they certainly did not skimp on our toppings!"}
{"text":"Always fast delivery and specials, I don't order delivery from anyone else. Pizza is fresh and a great size.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food trough Grub Hub around 7:15pm on a Tuesday night, my \"estimated time of arrival\" was 8:32pm, around 9pm I called just to double check on my order and was told \"we're waiting for the drivery driver to come back  and your order will be ready\" and was rushed off the phone?! Now since I used to work for a pizza delivery place I was very patient,  but also was very turned off buy the customer care!! My food finally arrived at 9:25pm and the driver still reciever a more then substantial tip of $5 (which was put in in advance) but for the business its self... well I wont be ordering from here ever again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizza is awesome, the subs are awesome, the family is awesome. The wings are great, and salads are great too. They have delivery or you can eat in. Nice clean place. Actually, very clean.  I love the crust on their pizza at, and the deluxe Italian sub. Garlic wings Yum. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The deep pizza is amazing and simply delicious, the deepest, cheesiest pizza you can ask for, the pizza is perfect it self, too bad it got to me cold today."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery only. The other night I ordered a large cheese pie from Cerasoli Pizzeria. I also asked for a dozen garlic knots which they said they do not have?? The delivery was fast and the pizza was still hot. The pizza itself was just ok nothing special at all. I would have too say I would not order pizza from Cerasoli Pizzeria again. Also When I called to order the pizza I could barely understand the gentleman that answered the phone do to his thick accent. The delivery guy was really nice and came fast. Too bad the pizza was nothing special."}
{"text":"First time we ordered from there we got the  Chicago style deep dish pizza. It was one of the very best I have ever tasted. After only one bite you know all the ingredients are fresh. And sauce is outta this world! It was Nice and hot too.  Second time we ordered a regular pizza and wings. Again the ingredients were super fresh, you know that the onion and pepper were cut just for that pizza. The hot wings were bland and not spicy but nice and hot. They deep fry all  their wings as I perfer baked in sauce.  Third time got another regular pizza and a steak and cheese hoagie. Pizza GREAT, hoagie bland.  Moral of story.. They make some the of the BEST pizza in Pittsburgh. So far with the other stuff for me just seems lacking. But with Pizza like that, who cares?!? Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and house rolls are awesome! Everything else I've had there is sub-par. But the pizza is legit. Sauce is amazing and they loadddd on the toppings. Definitely recommend it!"}
