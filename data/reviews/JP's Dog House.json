{"text":"I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for JP's! I am not normally a hot dog kind of person, but JP's has left me CRAVING more since my first visit. The man knows what he's doing, and never disappoints with his nightly special. I only wish that he would serve these awesome dogs more nights a week on the corner of Bethany Home and 16th St."}
{"text":"There's hot dog stands and then there's jp's. You want pulled pork on your hot dog? No problem. Smashed avocado? Sure. Chimi-churri sauce? Duh. Fritos? Why not! And don't forget to grab a taco while you're at it. Grab a seat at the picnic table in the parking lot and enjoy your regular sized or jumbo sized hot dog. You won't regret it. This place will change your life."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that the hotdogs are pure deliciousness, JP saves the night when you have a late night craving! If available, try the Barnyard. Shredded chicken, pulled pork, bacon, sriracha and cheese all atop a perfect dog, it is always my go-to! When he doesn't have all the fixings on deck, you still won't be disappointed with JP's knack for perfect flavor combinations."}
{"text":"So I rolled up to this hole in the wall bar a friend of mine wanted to go to. And there before me was this hot dog stand. Yassss!

I'm from L. A. so when I go somewhere and there is a hot dog stand outside of it, there are two things I am certain of: 

1. The place your going is going to be off the chain. 

2. When you're done partying, they'll be yummy for your tummy afterwards."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. The quality of all the ingredients are outstanding. The owner himself serves you with a smile. He makes your dog and street tacos himself! If you are lucky enough to catch it, there's street corn!!"}
