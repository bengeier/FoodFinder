{"text":"One star, at least it's edible and not poison.  Forged tips on my card on a take out once.  Waited 20 minutes on sushi,  ( (I guess I wait 2 more minute on my pepsi to go, please) with 2 tables in the whole restaurant and chef surfing online, ah, told me there's a party for the wait?  Ah.........speechless, 4 star price and 2 star sushi, unbelievable.....came back only because it's close to where I live.............speechless"}
