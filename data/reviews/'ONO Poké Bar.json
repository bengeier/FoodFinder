{"text":"Honestly this place is the best! The staff are so friendly, the portions are huge and most importantly the food is delicious. They really take care in choosing quality ingredients while also being creative with their combination of flavours. My go to is the ahi tuna bowl and it never disappoints. Definitely recommend to anyone craving delicious fresh and filling poke bowls. Ono for the win!"}
{"text":"Got the seared tuna burrito. It was delicious. The flavors infused in the burrito were perfect. Spoke with one of the owners after my meal. He was humble and friendly and I'll definitely be back when I visit. The staff was friendly and made this a very pleasant meal. Thanks ONO and hope the business blooms! P.S. The packaged wasabi is extremely spicy. Be careful as you use it!"}
{"text":"The portion of their poké bowl is so much!!! I couldn't finish one by myself which is so worth the $14 compare to other poké place! I love their sauce and food are fresh! Definitely recommend to others. Will be one of my favourite dinner takeout place!   The owners are so nice by the way!"}
{"text":"I have some diet restriction which the staff here are very understanding about and cater to.  They go above and beyond to make sure I'm getting the right poke bowl.  The won me over from the moment I walked in the door, as they went above and beyond what I was expecting.    The food and customer service here are great!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people give this place high reviews but I'm not sure why or if they're legitimate. Many people I talk to told me it wasn't good food or service and my two experiences there were horrible. Once I waited at the door for 10 mins while the 3 workers didn't even look at me or say hello or anything. I assumed they were busy and let them keep doing what they were EVEN AFTER I told them I wanted to make a custom bowl. They took 2 random people that came in during this time and finally I said \"is someone going to help me\" and claimed that you have to wait right in front of cash to order first. I mean...really? I was the only one in the store for the first 10 mins and told me I wanted to make a custom bowl and nobody felt the need to say ok let's order here or ok can you pay first or OK CAN WE HELP YOU.  The second time it was the same horrible no help experience and the food was bad and soggy on top of it. I love poke and toronto has soooo many good places around, so don't waste your time here, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant with a nice twist on Japanese cuisine. The food and service are both great and the location is accessible. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the spicy mango salmon poke bowl that I got from 'ONO Poké Bar! It was really delicious and I definitely recommend eating here. I didn't expect to receive such a large portion and was pleasantly surprised to see how much you get in comparison to the burrito."}
{"text":"Ordered the torched salmon poke for lunch. It was pretty good and a nice change from the same old lunch spots at LV. Service was quick and staff friendly. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"The BEST poke place ive ever tried! Got my poke fix. The torched salmon is so good. The ingredients are so fresh. Great value for the price, the portions are so generous. Would definitely go back and try the other flavours. P.s the guys working there are so kind and cool."}
{"text":"Food is great! The ingredients are fresh, it has a great balance of tastes, and the portions are huge! I couldn't finish a bowl on my own.  It's a bonus that the staff is so enthusiastic."}
{"text":"I gotta start by announcing that the pictures on here are downright deceiving - they make the Poké bowls look tiny in comparison to their actual hefty size. My eyes actually widened when I saw the amount of rice they filled the bowl with, and my belly protested afterwards too when it stretched to its limits. I have a decent appetite and I had to split by bowl into two separate meals.   SPACE - The store itself has limited seating but they have a lovely patio area available, which was the perfect setting for a laid back dinner on a warm summer night. Space is clean and well organized, and they do have a washroom inside!   FOOD - I got the torched salmon build-your-own bowl (after reading others' reviews about how rare this meat option was) with corn, carrots, cucumbers, and edamame beans for veggies/fruit options; a little of everything for toppings; and the spicy mango sauce for dressing (refreshingly sweet at first taste and a kick of spice at the end that sets your tongue on fire in a good way). If you're unsure of which sauce to get don't be afraid to ask to try them! My friend got the unagi bowl and as with my torched salmon bowl, I was surprised with the generous portions of meat given. The rice was also perfectly cooked!  SERVICE - I was THAT person who hadn't decided what they wanted to order by the time they got to the cash register. Not only were the staff understanding and endlessly patient, they gave honest suggestions and opinions when asked. I struggled big time with choosing toppings, and throughout my whole \"uh, do I want onions? Uh..no I don't want that.. actually yes a little..\" disaster the staff remained helpful and good spirited. Honestly, I would give 3 stars for the amazing service alone (1 for each of the kind souls who held my hand through the whole process).  Overall, the food was delicious and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. I will be returning to fulfill my Poké cravings in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Poké Bar, and....... WOWWWW! This was amazing! Definitely a different experience, with a variety of tastes and options! The location is a great and the customer service is phenomenal! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is always a go to in the neighbourhood. Glad it opened. Good size portions and friendly staff! Hope it sticks around"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Toronto poke spots and this is my favorite of them! It feels the most authentic to my ultimate favorites back in California and Hawaii.   Portions are definitely reasonable for the price (cough unlike Calii Love's robbery on King West), salmon is fresh, topping selection is expansive, good choice of sauces too. Next time I will try their torched options!"}
{"text":"This establishment is right in my neighbourhood. I popped in once at a friends request. It was a big portion of food but not what my tastebuds were expecting. The people there were really nice and I'm used to line ups but not a place I'd visit again."}
{"text":"I ordered a make your own bowl with tofu and added crab meat on half brown rice and half salad. The serving is very big so make sure you bring your appetite! I ate it in 3 separate sittings because it was a LOT.  The service is friendly- they are happy to explain menu items and provide samples. Personally the tofu is a little too sweet for my liking. If you are going to get tofu then I would recommend offsetting the sweetness with a spicy sauce.   Their menu has quite a variety but does not have chicken or zucchini noodles as I have seen som other Poke restaurants have. The prices are comparable to other Poke bowls in Toronto at about $12-15.   The restaurant is quite small with a intimate dine in area. I'm guessing it's more popular for take out.   I tried the ponzu sauce and truffle mayo for my bowl and it was very tasty"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have tried their mango bowl and their torched salmon. I do enjoy the fact that they offer more unique bowls and have torched salmon and tuna, though I wasn't a huge fan of either of the bowls I've had. Ingredients were fresh but I didn't really think they went well together, and like someone else had said below, too much tempura bits. Their wasn't much fish in the bowl either. I'm also not huge on non marinated fish in poke bowls, but that's just personal preference. At the $15 I paid per bowl, it also seems a bit  pricey, though the bowl was huge. Maybe they should have a smaller size for people to choose from for less.  I work around here so maybe for my poke cravings I would visit again, but this is definitely not my favourite poke place unfortunately ."}
{"text":"Ono Poke Bar delivers to it's full extent. The special thing about Ono's Poke Bar is that they have torched salmon and torched tuna on their menu. As a fan of torched sushi, of course, I ordered the 'Ono' Torched Salmon poke bowl.  Surprisingly, when the employee first took the empty clear plastic bowl up, I was shocked of how big the bowl itself was. Other poke places that I have been to don't have such a big bowl and I knew I was in for a treat. The employee put in masago, tamago, a big lump of avocado, carrot, corn, edamame, green onion, tenkasu, fried onion, furikake and topped it off with the torched salmon and wasabi mayo.  After all that, I was ready to dig in. The poke bowl looks very appealing in terms of looks. After my first bite, I thought it was fantastic. All the ingredients compliment each other very well as the texture and taste were great. I am not a huge fan of wasabi in general so I thought the wasabi mayo overpowered much of the flavour of the bowl. Next time, I'll ask them to put less wasabi mayo. However, if you are a fan of wasabi, you would love it. The decor is nice with the limited amount of space they have. They also have a patio so you can enjoy your poke in the great outdoors.   I definitely will come back to try the 'Ono' Torched Tuna poke bowl and maybe one day a sushi burrito but my love for poke bowls grew stronger after eating at 'Ono' Poke Bar."}
{"text":"Pricey for students but expected for everything on Liberty Village. Lots of variety for veggies, protein option, and sauces. Everything youd want on a poke bowl. They also have some desserts like raindrop cake for three bucks extra. Friendly staff.   They do Ritual! Don't forget to ask for stamps when you arrive to pick up.  Note: probably better and cheaper to build your own bowl!"}
{"text":"Best poke bar in downtown Toronto IMO. Very generous portion sizes and super fresh ingredients. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Although the location is a little odd it is definitely worth it to come here for Poké. The portions are quite huge and they are quite generous. I ordered the smoke salmon bowl ($14) and it was very filling and tasted fresh (they smoke the salmon in front of u).  The wasabi sauce was really unique as it gave the wasabi taste but not as spicy as wasabi. Finally the staff were quite nice and asked me if i wanted certain sauces or garnishs on my bowl."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different after flying into town. I love Hawaiian Poke, but hadn't tried the bowls that are becoming so popular. It's a lot of food, tons of different combinations of proteins, fruits/veggies, and sauces. I designed my own bowl, but I think I'll do one of their combinations on a future visit. I tried a few different sauces and settled on the spicy mango. It was a good combo of flavor and spice. The people are super nice and patient with a first-timer. I'm in the area very infrequently, but hope to return."}
{"text":"I think I may have found my favourite poké place in Toronto! This place is amazing! Large portion sizes, a build-your-own bowl option, a double your protein option, a variety of sauces and a loyalty card! The shop is small, but has one table at which you can sit. They have a snap your meal program where if you share a photo of your meal on social media, they will give you an extra stamp on your loyalty card. Honestly, you have to give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Overall, ingredients seemed same day fresh & nothing tasted off but the following is where the meal fell short:  * Steak & rice at room temperature, not hot (concern of safe consumption). * Protein portion short of 4oz. (4oz is a bare minimum to curb hunger). * Mostly filler ingredients & lacks nutrient dense inclusive options (short on value).  For the same price, there are hot options at Metro that would cover two meals.  Also, Bento Sushi at Metro Liberty Village offers poke bowls with a reasonable amount of protein and at decent pricing."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the serving sizes are huuuge. I had the torched ahi tuna sushi burrito with raw tuna instead of torched and it was excellent . The staff is really friendly, they have a loyalty card, and they're available on ritual"}
{"text":"We visited on the second day of their grand opening. 30% all orders this weekend. The portions are huge! Very delicious food. Great customer service. Also try out the raindrop cake. It has caramel and soybean flavored powder."}
{"text":"This place serves delicious poke bowls that are topped with fresh, creative and unexpected flavour combinations. Well priced and bonus points for using in environmentally responsible packaging. Definitely on my list of \"go to\" places when I am hungry and craving a healthy and flavourful meal. The owners and staff are also super friendly!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews for restaurants, but I honestly felt like I had to for Ono. As so many others have said, they are great. The food is always so fresh and filling, I've tried three different bowls now and they have all been delicious. The staff here is equally as awesome as the food - they are so helpful, patient, fun and friendly that I literally leave with a smile on my face every time. Once we ordered the steak bowl and they were all out of steak, so we got another option, but they gave us a discount on our order/extra toppings because they felt so bad! Totally unnecessary but a really nice thing to do. Ono is amazing food AND amazing customer service - a really valuable addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've tried two of their pokes and tried one of their sushi burritos on two different visits.   Sushi burrito I received was soggy and falling apart. Mushroom juice was literally leaking out of the burrito and there was not enough sauce.  Poke bowls were tasteless and not alot of toppings. Mostly rice, not enough dressing so it was dry and not very satisfying.  On the upside, the employees there are really nice. Unfortunately, their food is not worth it. There are definitely better places in Toronto for your poke and sushi burrito fix."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend when I was starving! Thankfully ONO filled me right up! I ordered the \"Classic Salmon\" and I remember it being very fresh and refreshing. The way I am most satisfied with a meal is when I have variety of components on the dish and I eat them all together. Poké bowls are a great way of achieving that. I ordered my poké on a bed of white rice. The salmon was very fresh and had that great raw texture. The greens and the tangerines added a rich freshness and more texture of the bowl. A few of the ingredients on the poké bowl were new to me, however all the components of ONO's poké bowls singed with harmony and pleasantly brought bold tasting favour into my mouth. I always accept the sauce when they ask me if I want any and the customer service was very nice. I couldn't finish my poké bowl because the portions were large and so you really get your bang for your buck. (Which is great because you can save more for later)    Overall, I would definitely come back here if I wanted more poké bowls in my life."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mac' A What bowl because I've heard great things about this place.   I don't think I have eaten anything saltier in my life. I ate half and had to toss the rest. I'm not sure what ingredients were particularly overwhelming, but whatever it was made this inedible for me. Kind of a waste of $14 unfortunately.   I ordered through Ritual; service did appear to be good, especially during the busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"The salmon bowl with wasabi mayo was delicious. There are so many sides to pick from you can customize your bowl to be everything you ever dreamed of. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered the Spicy Mango Salmon mostly because I love spicy poke bowls and I love salmon. But I regret this choice and should've gotten the ONO torched salmon that most yelpers have gotten. There was too much rice in the bowl so the ratio of toppings to rice was small. I personally think a poke bowl should have either seaweed salad or crab salad, and majority of the bowls didn't have that. I also really love pickled ginger but i didn't see that in many of ghe bowls either. The bowl was not spicy at all and towards the middle of the bowl, there was barely any sauce so it became a little bland. I did like how fresh the vegetables were. If I do return I am going to try something else. Overall, it didn't make my top 5 poke places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this poke but bother of our bowls we're underwhelming. The portion was huge and the facility was organized, clean, and friendly. The poke was also pretty expensive compared to bowls we get in the states and the flavors didn't mesh as well. The torched ahi bowl was my least favorite of the two and the mango was the saving grace of my spicy mango salmon bowl."}
{"text":"One word. WOW.  This is the best poke place I have been to. The fish is fresh, they have a huge selection of unique toppings and their sauces are made in-house and taste amazing.  I've been here 3 times already since they opened and their torched salmon bowl is my go to order.   The owners are super friendly, patient and helpful with their recommendations. They also have a loyalty card that lets you get the 5th bowl for 50% off and the 10th bowl for free. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I spontaneously discovered ONO on ritual and became an instant fan! TBH, the other poke places in Toronto aren't very good... they add so many random toppings (i.e. kale??)... it ends up tasting like a freshii rice bowl.  Back to ONO, the portions are pretty massive, the toppings are delicious and compliment the raw fish nicely. I also really like how they TORCH the raw fish in their poke bowls. I wish they gave more fish so i'm not only left with toppings half way through the bowl. I hope they open a  second location closer to central dt!  Recommendations:  ONO Torched Ahi Tuna ONO Torched Salmon"}
{"text":"This place is ok but super limited seating and people not eating seem to just hang around in it and take up table space. The portions are HUGE which we weren't expecting. It felt a lot like a chipotle. The food was ok but the setting itself was a huge turn off when trying to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"I was lucky to attend the soft opening for the LV community. They took over the old ice cream parlour. The tasting event offered 5 choices of poke bowls / burritos. I was surprised that they served torched salmon which I think no other poke place has on its menu.  The torched salmon bowl was really good. In the bowl was a choice of brown or white rice with some edamame, tangerines, roe and other stuff.  It was a good balance and I was full at the end.  The sushi burritos were also good with torched salmon.    In the summer, people can enjoyed the patio. We sat at the patio with heat lamps as the inside was finishing up the renovations. Definitely, a welcomed addition to the area."}
{"text":"Their torched salmon burrito is the best sushi burrito I've had! Service is awesome and fast, plus they are super generous on the serving size. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Very delicious, filling and Instagram-worthy poke bowls! It's quite a walk from my office but I am super down for trying out more poke bowls!"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 7.5/10 Drink: n/a Service: 9.5/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 9/10 Aesthetics: 8/10  Came here after walking for a couple hours at the Toronto Fall Home Show.   The sushi burrito I ordered had was the torched salmon. The ingredients were reasonable, the torched salmon adds a bit of smokiness, but also left a bit of a weird aftertaste from the fuel used to torch it.   I also tried a little bit of the mango salmon poke, it was decent but the salmon tasted a little off to me. The portion was much more generous than many other poke stores.  The cost is ~$15, which isn't really unusual for a poke/sushi burrito.   I think it is a decent place, but it's tucked away in a more residential neighborhood near liberty village. Aesthetically, it's not bad looking, the simple black decor. The staff was friendly and service was great.  Not bad value when compared to the rest of the neighbourhood, but the food itself could use a little more tweaking."}
{"text":"While driving back home and stuck in CNE traffic my boyfriend and I decided to use our RITUAL app to pre oder some food while stuck on the road. We both ordered their vegetarian bowls (avocado tofu and truffle mushroom) really tasty and perfect portion size and price was just right. Really awesome to have a place like this in the neighbourhood!!! Two full and happy people for $25.00"}
{"text":"In the heart of Liberty Village, Ono Poke is a great addition to the area. Jen and I decided to catch a quick bite before the Toronto FC evening match. Quickly preordering via mobile app we saved $5 off our total order and ion arrival our meals were ready to be devoured. The venue is a nice place, with both indoor and outdoor seating available.  They've got a great selection of dishes along with its condiments.   Torched ahi sushi with Brian rice, crispy onions, cabbage, edamame beans, etc.  Melody of great, fresh, colorful, delicious flavor.    Original sushi poke bowl - I was able to scam some off Jen lol. Though original, you can't go wrong with this one.  Overall great place, If I am ever at a Toronto FC game, this will be my go-to place. delish!"}
{"text":"I tried the torched salmon poke bowl and loved it. I can be a bit hit or miss about fish, but the flavour of the bowl was awesome and well-balanced. Initially, I thought the price seemed a bit high (after tax and tip) but you get ALOT of food (like, there is serious weight to these bowls), and there are a number of high quality, expensive, ingredients in the mix. I'm so happy that this as an option in the neighbourhood now... I think I could eat a bowl for every meal!"}
{"text":"Came here for their grand opening on Saturday at 1pm.  Was only 3 customers there at that time.   They were offering 30% off, free samples, music and selfie booth but nothing was fully setup at the time I was there.  I was able to get a torched ahi tuna bowl for around $12 with tax and 30% off included.  Other than the fish being torched, it pretty much tasted the same as most shops that serve poke bowls.  Amount of fish was less than I would like and there was too much tempura bits in my bowl.  Around 1:30 pm they started giving out free samples of there nigiri sushi and candied sushi which I enjoyed more than the poke bowl."}
{"text":"I ordered the torched salmon bowl from Uber eats. Unfortunately, just didn't hit the mark.   The ingrediedents just did not mesh... and the scant amount of protein was soooo much less than other poke places out there. Our bowl was 90%rice, then 10 % additional toppings. Would have ratcheted a 70/20/10% ratio so at least we'd have a respectable protein representation.   Will likely not be back, mostly based on the lack of protein for the $$$."}
{"text":"This is the best poke I've had in the city! They have such great combinations and options, and I love that you can build your own bowl or burrito. The option to have it on greens is a plus too. The flavour of everything I've tried so far has been amazing, and it's also great value. I've had both the regular and seared tuna, as well as the unagi bowl, and all were fantastic. Highly recommend this place; it has become a new go-to spot for a quick, yummy and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. I always order on ritual and love their options. The flavours are just right and the portions are very generous. Location is great for those living in liberty village. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Poke' and was so excited when I saw that a Poke place opened up in Liberty Village. This place did not disappoint, the fish is fresh, they have a great selection of toppings and sauces, and they are friendly, it's a winner. I get the build your own bowl on brown rice with one scoop of the raw tuna, I add some Avocado which a little more money but I think worth it. The portion is huge, definitely worth the money. Fresh, healthy and so good."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite Poké spots in the GTA. Along with Calii Love. Very generous portions, I've had a couple of their bowls, however my favourite is the Kabayaki Unagi! I had it as a burrito but I can imagine the bowl being just as delicious. Their ingredients are so fresh, especially their avocado, which is a key indicator that they know what's up. They are very generous with their portions, and you will definitely feel full.  I highly recommend some taro chips for the road as they are crisp to perfection! Add some garlic mayo on the side too. Love this spot, will be back!"}
{"text":"Great combinations and flavors. Friendly staff, quick service. Will become a regular lunch spot with coworkers~"}
{"text":"Honestly the service was so friendly and the food was really amazing and done the way i wanted. I never ordered from here before so i was pleased with my first try. it'll be a high recommendation for me to anyone asking !"}
{"text":"Great Poke spot in liberty village. Had the torched salmon and honey tuna which were both good. It's a small area with not too much seating, would be a good take out spot. Quite a lot of filling, moderate amount of meat, still gets you full tho. You can't pick and choose your toppings like customizing dish. Overall decent poke place."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised coming to this place, because I've been spoiled by real poke in Hawaii and did not have high hopes. While this place does not necessarily match up with the original stuff on the island, my poke bowl was delicious!   I ordered the torched salmon bowl bowl with half brown rice and half mixed greens (the fact that you can do mixed bases is soooooo nice because only greens is not super filling, but only rice is way too much rice). The bowl was topped with a decent amount of torched salmon, edamame, tomago, fish roe, crunchy onions and there was flavoured nori spinkled in. Overall, super tasty and filling.   PRO TIP: The line is huge, but we ordered with Ritual, and our food was waiting for us on the counter when we got there! I heard people grumble about 30 minutes waits, so DEFINITELY ORDER ONLINE and save yourself the headache of a long wait! (as I re-read my review I realized that this sounds like an add for Ritual, so I would like to say that I do not have any personal or professional affiliation with Ritual...this is just going to make your life better if you don't like waiting for your food!)"}
{"text":"Excellent! So fresh, so tasty, so friendly! I finally stopped in here after two weeks in town and picked up a poke bowl. Steven and Jessica were very nice and helpful. All of the ingredients are incredibly fresh and tasty. I got the spicy mango salmon bowl with a perfectly flavored sauce (that I had on the side) and the tofu bowl. Next time I'm in Toronto I won't wait until a few nights before I leave to visit this place...so I can get it more than once!"}
{"text":"For $15 a bowl, I'm more than disappointed. Yes they have very unique bowls such as torched salmon and ahi tuna, but it doesn't help when you only get three pieces of torched salmon in a giant bowl. Also the fundamentals of rice cooking is lacking, as it was lumpy mushed together rice clumps. The corn pellets were powdery, not sure what brand of corn they are using? Also wayyyyy too many tempura bits, my mouth is overflowing with crunchy bits that are not what I paid for. To say that I want my money back would be an understatement."}
{"text":"Oh man. You wanna get filled up, go here immediately.  It feels like about a metric ton of food. And good food. They have torched salmon - which is pretty uncommon, I think - and crazy tasty tofu bowl. It's pretty sweet, but there's an awesome mix of ingredients and textures.  It's heavier than some poke, mostly because of delicious delicious sauces. So don't expect to be all low cal/carb with this place. Think comfort food poke.  If you can finish one in a single seating, you're my hero. So, go try."}
{"text":"I love this place - I discovered Ono through door dash and omg...it's so good (please don't ever stop doing door dash or I think I'll legitimately cry). The torched salmon is so good...I'm usually not crazy on poke bowls but I crave Ono atleast once a week. I just wish they were downtown so I could eat it more often. I'm a pretty picky eater so when I find a place I like, I love it :) I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was in a very obscure place, right under a condo I believe and in the middle of a neighbourhood so my friend and I thought we were lost at first because we were walking into what we thought was a private neighbourhood  but other then that their bowls are very large and tasty! The fish tasted fresh and not fishy at all, it wasn't busy when we went but we went around 2 so I'm not sure what it would be like closer to noon. I would definitely come here again as their food was filling and really hit the spot for my poke craving."}
{"text":"Value packed deliciousness. It's more of a take out place until the summer where they have ample patio seating. I've tried build your own and the Saikoro steak bowls both with white rice. Seriously they are jammed with toppings. I wasn't familiar with some of the toppings (ie. tamago) and they let me have a little taste test. Oh and the staff are super sweet."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Ono Poke Bar. The staff were friendly and the poke bowl that I ordered (torched salmon) was well presented. Its slightly overpriced. I also thought it lacked flavour. However, I wouldn't be opposed to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here cause coworker introduced me to it.   Food: 3 / 5  Have been here 4 times.  The bowl is awesome.  I wanted and tried ordering the sushi burrito through Ritual, when I opened the burrito back in the office everything fell off, which made a horrible eating experience.   Customer Service: 4/5  Quite attentive most of the time  Price: 3.5/5 Most poke bowl / burrito or wrap places' pricing are usually around this price.   Overall: Definitely try the bowl, I would hesitate about the burrito."}
{"text":"Nice service, friendly staff, tasty food! I love it! Definitely I'll be back there."}
{"text":"My friend has an obsession over poke bowls so she took us here for lunch after the gym. It was a bit pricy but so delicious and filling. I got the torched salmon poke bowl and half of it filled me right up.   They don't have jalepenos but they have these wasabi packages that are extremely spicy and so good with the fish. I love spicy and when I used the whole package, my poke bowl was even better with it."}
{"text":"So happy that this placed turned out to be a gem, it's right beside my apartment!  Can be a bit of a wait if you catch them during peak hours but the food is fresh & delicious. I had the classic salmon sushi burrito, generously sized & really tasty.   Can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"big portion but too much veggies and not much salmon in my poke bowl... the price ain't cheap either!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Sushi, and so I had to try this place! Super local, and I had heard all the rave reviews.   I quite enjoyed it, however as he portions are quite large, it got somewhat ..boring halfway through. I'd like there to be a smaller size of possible, and more customization on the menu would be super great.   Price seemed a tad steep to me.  Would definitely recommend it though as I'm not familiar with any others Poke Bowl places in the area. Tastes very fresh, very filling, and is local."}
{"text":"4/5  I was craving a poke bowl for the longest time, and I'm super happy with my decision coming to ONO Poke Bar.  ONO Poke Bar is your typical Poke Bar but executed well. You can choose from a base of spring mix, brown rice, or sushi rice. There are 5 - 7 pre-determined combination pokebowls/burritoes, and an option to create your own as well! (choose base, 3 vegetables, and various toppings, 1 protein) for $13 + additional cost for deluxe toppings/extra protein.  When I first went into the store I was like WHOA there. The store was just so compact. Once you enter you are literally right in front of the waiting area for the poke bowl. You have to literally SQUEEZE by just to get to the end of the line... and this is especially difficult when there are several people waiting/deciding on their order.  The order area may be super squished, but the Patio and dining area are a little better in terms of breathing room. The earthen decor definitely makes up for the lack of space though! Cool paintings, statues, and signage everywhere you look!!!  The staff are also incredibly sweet. They were very patient with my picky customizations. I ordered a Classic Salmon Poke Bowl with sauce on the side, purple cabbage instead of fried onion, and extra furikake. They pleasantly asked if I wanted a bag, and were very courteous about everything from my transaction, to ordering, to pickup.  SOYA!!! (sauce) I love ONO Poke Bar. It's healthy, delicious, and the service is friendly. But the reason why I'm only giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that 1) it's pricey... now usually I'm okay with paying $13+ for a meal so long as the quality of the expensive ingredients is acceptable... but the salmon in my Classic Salmon Poke Bowl was subpar. It was unnecessarily fatty (chewy white parts), it didn't taste that fresh (no taste of ocean :( ) and I felt like the added soy sauce just masked the tastelessness of the salmon even more. Honestly would have been perfect if they used better quality seafood :'( oh wells.  They also have a customer loyalty card. 5th poke bowl is 50% off, and for every 10 purchases you get a free poke bowl/burritoes.  Overall, let's hope my wallet doesn't cry because it looks like I'm gonna go for the free poke bowl :P"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what I was getting but they helped in choosing the perfect bowl for me. Amazing service and great food! What more could you ask for?! If you haven't gone yet, just do it!"}
{"text":"This place was in a nice little spot. Super fresh and really good mixture in the bowl. We got the classic salmon bowl. We mixed brown rice with salad which made it balanced. Really friendly staff"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to check this place out since it received such positive reviews. I've been to many poke spots in Toronto, but this one was a big let down for me.  The space is actually quite snug with maximum seating for 6-8 people, but there is patio seating outside of weather permits.  The poke itself was not what I expected. I ordered the \"ONO Torched Ahi Tuna\" bowl for a whopping $15. The fish was okay, but the blowtorching was a bit of a gimmick here. The ingredients used to put together this bowl didn't quite work with the flavors. They used bits of tempura which I felt like I was getting cheated for the price I was paying for. The tuna didn't seem like it was marinated (very small portion of tuna), and they put way too much rice to \"fill the bowl\".  Overall, it just didn't wasn't on par with the other Poke places I've been to."}
{"text":"Tried this yesterday- amazing customer service and the food was sooooo good!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite poke places as of recently, smaller place that doesn't fit many for sit down, but their ingredients are fresh, have a great assortment of things to chose from and very satisfying for he size you're getting. Great for take out (order on ritual for easy access) and really friendly staff :) love he blow torch salmon!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best poke I've ever had in the city.  I've only been twice and both times I got the build your own. You pick your fish, 4 add ons, plus a bunch of free things and sauces you can add.  They don't skimp on anything and have unique ingredients I haven't seen at any other poke place like cheese!! I didn't get that, but it's there!  What really put the cherry on top of my amazing poke bowl was the truffle mayo!!! MMM! I love anything truffle and this really did it for me.  The staff are also beyond friendly!  It's a small place so don't count on a seat If you go during a busy time but it's an excellent meal to get as take out."}
