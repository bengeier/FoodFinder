{"text":"The BEST nuggets EVER! Made of chicken breast and not that masked meat like other fast food restaurants serve .. And their fries are on a different level .. And the garlic dip sauce just ties things perfectly together"}
{"text":"Bruh.  In a city dominated by smoked meat (which I also like, just to make it clear), I cannot even begin to tell you how much better my life has become since I ran into this place on Yelp.  Hands down, the best fried chicken in Montréal. Also to add to that resume, I'd say almost inarguably the best fries in Montréal. Guys, just listen. Those fries stay crispy even when left out cold. HOW DO THEY DO THAT? The fries are so good, the fries are so good, the fries are so good.   The fried chicken is also really delicious. Both the leg/wing and the breast: oh god, flavour right down to the bone. And the chicken nuggets. UNREAL. These are nothing like McDonalds nuggets. These are pieces of real chicken deep fried to create the same crust as your regular fried chicken. So good.  They also have chicken poutine using fried chicken. Need I say more?  Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I use to order delivery from them all the time but I think whenever they don't feel like delivering to the lower plateau, they just say they don't deliver to that location (even if they've delivered to my address many times). Otherwise, I am still a loyal and faithful customer."}
{"text":"I had to change my 5 stars because after coming to this place several times I have to say the quality is not consistent. And the last time the chicken was horrible, it wasn't fresh at all and it smelled bad I couldn't take another bite! That was my last time eating there and I still didn't build up the courage to give it another shot. Very sad."}
{"text":"This is awesome! I've been searching for fired chicken restaurant and I followed the map to get there and it didn't disappoint me, I had 2 chicks pcs combo, very filling and yummy! This is what  exactly I want!  And the guy there is so welcoming and super friendly! Will definitely go there again!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great chicken! Big servings! Great friendly service! Affordable price!  Poutine gave me the squeak squeak in the back of my teeth! (sign of good poutine) The chicken was moist and cooked just right! Palestinian rice was filling and cooked right there by the lady taking our order! Awesome!  Overall great place. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend and I must say it's pretty darn good.  There isn't much selection but everything on the menu is worth the price.  I usually get chicken poutine here since it is the only place I know of in Montreal that will fry the chicken before putting it in the poutine. Surprisingly, it mixes quite well.  Chicken tastes great, fries are above average, gravy wasn't that disgusting black oil that some joints use. Although it's of decent quality, the gravy isn't hot enough and seemed to have been mostly dumped in the middle leaving non-melted cheese curls on the side :(. It seemed to be a common repeated CRIMINAL offense (I'm kidding) so I removed a star.  Price: 4/5 - Very decent price, student friendly. Order the biggest portions and share with a friend is my advice. Selection: 4/5, limited menu, not much to choose from, but what's on it is good. Place: 3/5, small but good usage of what little space there is."}
{"text":"If you were to cut me, I would bleed fried chicken.  Poulet Bronzé is hands down my favourite chicken place in Montreal. I love everything about it. Slightly spicy, crispy, golden brown goodness in a brick building bathed in golden light. The place is reassuringly cozy in a way only places in the Concordia district seem to be.  The feeling of biting into a crispy fried chicken leg cannot be described in words adequately. It's a state of mind and body rivalled only by orgasm.  God bless Poulet Bronzé you guys are the proof that a better world is possible."}
{"text":"The pluses:  Meal was hot (had to wait for it to cook but the wait is worth it when it comes to eating food that's freshly cooked compared to food that's sitting under warming lamps).  Fries were surprisingly good as they had a nice outer coating and crunch to it.  The minuses:  Chicken pieces were quite small and the coating was average tasting at best.  Sadly, I came here to indulge in fried chicken so my experience was a disappointment.  Overall, a failing grade.  If you want to charge a premium price you have to make sure your product is likewise otherwise repeat visits are not warranted.  Ordered a three piece fried chicken and fries combo.  A canned drink is included.  The search for good fried chicken in Montreal continues."}
{"text":"Cheap and semi-affordable fried chicken. Service could be better on delivery and in store."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Service is always friendly!! I always have the spicy fried chicken and it is to die for! The spice is more of a background flavour, their fries are some of the best I've had, their chicken is always succulent, their macaroni salad is bomb, and their prices are damn good for the quality of food your getting! Honestly one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place as my friend was bugging me about it for a while.   Fried chicken and fries, nothing special. The fries are seasoned fries same as metro pizza. The chicken is fried a la max so if you're looking for greasy food then this is your place. I'm not a fan of fried chicken at all so it's not my thing but they did come super quick which was great. My meal was 7.99 which is another great factor. It's good but everything taste the same.Fast, cheap,good."}
{"text":"One of my inlaws recommended this place to me because they all know how much I love chicken. Got a chicken sandwich trio and found it to be pretty good. While the sandwich was decent, the fries were amazing. Would come back here just for the fries."}
{"text":"Deliciously crispy & spicy fried chicken breast nuggets with amazing fries and garlic mayo - my fave junk food spot in the city!! This place may not be the prettiest but it sure is tasty and affordable. Seriously, this is my go to for halal fried chicken in MTL."}
{"text":"So far this place is the best when it comes to quality and prices. The food is fresh and the portion is really big... For four years now I go to this place twice a week.  I strongly  recommend it. I recommend the fried chicken and shrimp. Also, I recommend the chicken with the rice. They have one of the best cheese cakes ever but I dunno why it's not in the menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this restaurant out, because of the all great reviews.  I'll get straight to the point and say that their fired chicken and French fries are great, but there's nothing special about it. Maybe I had a high expectation about it, but the French fires are basically from Costco that's why they are great.  Nonetheless service was great and the food too, but nothing special about it. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Howdy!  Normally Poulet Bronze is my go to place for late night fried chicken. $2.25/piece for a very spicy and crispy coating is nothing to sneeze at, especially when it is delivered to your door after 11 pm.  However, last night they screwed up right royally and I am questioning my need for fried chicken in a city that knows how to do steak tartare, foie gras croissants better than anyplace else this (or that) side of the Mississippi...  In short, half the order was forgotten. No one said \"sorry.\" When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told he wasn't in. When I asked that the manager call me, I was told he would, but he didn't. And then on top of it the delivery guy/driver yelled at me when he returned (an hour later) with the forgotten half, because he had not been trained properly to check that he was taking everything on that was written on the bill.  They opened a second location in ville Saint Laurent, and the more I think about it, the more convinced I become that like East Side Mario's, Madison's Barr + Grill, and other wannabe American restaurants they belong there and not downtown in Montreal.  Perhaps, if I am racked up in a hospital and unable to do anything other than blink my eyes in order to communicate, I might reconsider ordering from them, but only because Poulet Bronze is 12 letters long and Dinette Triple Crown is 18 letters long. But ultimately I think it comes down to a question of respect. And nothing shows how much a restaurant respects a client as when the delivery guy yells at you in the hall and the manager can't even be bothered to say \"I'm sorry.\"  And finally, as I alluded to earlier, there is so much good food that is native to Montreal, I'm not quite convinced anymore for the need to deal with what could only be considered average food imported from elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times when I was studying at Concordia! Loveee their fried chicken and loveeeeee their poutine!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. It's open late so it's convenient if you're hungry and around there. I went there around midnight and ordered a chicken poutine. The service was pretty decent and took about 5 mins for me to get it. The poutine's chicken was fried which I like better than grilled so that was good also the small size is a good portion for around $8. Overall it's a good late night spot or if you're at Concordia."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place I get fried chicken from in Montreal. Especially late nights it opens and delivers to around 2-3ish. Very good and portions are filling. Fries are bomb esp + the garlic sauce. I've tried most things on their menu, would recommend to stick with the chicken pieces. Their chicken wings are pretty dry and their chicken sandwich tasted like something you could make at home. I'd recommend you try other places if you wanna get those two things but other than that the traditional chicken pieces are very good"}
{"text":"Tasty fried chicken and shrimps too. Freshly prepared. Very good portions. Stuff is really welcoming. Usually fast service. No bad experience in the 10 of times i went there.  I always try their fried buttered shrimp, big ones. I was however annoyed that they increased the price without changing their menu or the board in the restaurant. You have the choice of getting 8 pcs instead of 12 with the dame old price or paying 6$ more for the usual 12 pcs combo. I an also annoyed buy their small extras you gave to pay for spicy or extra dipping etc... I would have easily gave then 4 stars if it wasn't for these comments."}
{"text":"Best halal fried chicken ! I love to visit this location when craving some fried chicken. The service is quick and the crunch of the chicken is very consistent. The fries are tasty and also have a nice crisp to them. The seatings are very limited but dont let it a turn off, take the food to go and sit by the benches in front of concordia (right in front of the A&W and tim hortons , coner Guy and Maisoneuve)   If poulet bronze is too far and you are craving fried chicken check out Basha Fried Chicken in Montreal Est.  Cheers n enjoy the comfort food"}
{"text":"Long time back Poulet Bronze used to be a good fried chicken joint in Montreal.  All the recent times I ordered, the food was cooked in old oil and caused severe gastric issues.  The customer service was also not up to the mark.   Good for cheap late night delivery. Very inconsistent in quality."}
{"text":"They say this is the best Montréal fried chicken you can get.   I must admit it for the price & quality & quantity. Not bad place at all.  I went to this place with most of my friends to try.  Their chicken nuggets are really good. Only one thing is you pay 1$ to add spicy but you can't taste it. You may see few red pepper.  I specially like their fries. Really good just like the one at Blanche Neiges on street Côté Des Neiges."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on a bad night, plus I had delivery. But my chicken tasted like it was fried in old grease as well as the fries. On top of that, it had a slightly unpleasant smell. They also were not customer friendly over the phone. Maybe it would have been a better experience dining in, but it sucked my first go round."}
{"text":"For service alone, this place deserves five stars! The food is decent (fries, poutines, sandwiches), but the portion sizes are consistently big. They have no problems delivering, especially during the dead of night on a super snowy evening (they've always arrived within 25 mins of placing my order)! Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Wonderful fried chicken and good service. Hope they're planing to add fried fish sometime."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a little bit hidden and a little bit run down. There's not really any nice decor whatsoever so it doesn't really stand out.  FOOD: The first time I had their fried chicken, I thought it was amazing. I craved it for weeks afterwards. Then the second time I came back, it was not good. Super greasy and the worst part was there were little hairs on my chicken. It made me lose all appetite. I hear their poutines are good but I'm not sure if I would come back after my last experience. Maybe one day I'll try the menu again.  PRICE: Prices are not very expensive, especially since it's in a student-friendly area.  SERVICE: Service is ok, the staff don't seem like they're the friendliest but they did their jobs."}
