{"text":"I have been looking for a place like this since moving to Calgary.  I was there around 11 AM, so it was super quiet.  Found it rather by accident!

Lovely graffiti decor and local art.  And they have music sometimes!  Decent food selection, good prices.  It wasn't super fast, possibly because it wasn't long after they'd opened; I wasn't in a hurry.  The sandwich was delicious.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service is excellent and friendly! Environment is clean and joyful and it's located in a quiet part of Calgary"}
{"text":"I love this little caf√©, quiet, good espresso and good baked goods. It is a shame it is not busier because it is much better than your typical coffee shop offering."}
{"text":"It's 2018... they need at least one vegan item on their foods menu (or at least something that can be made vegan) and staff that understand what the word \"vegan\" means.

Guess I expected too much from a hipster joint."}
{"text":"Love love love this cafe!  I'm not sure why but this cafe reminds me of a place in Amsterdam that I love and miss.  It is cozy, friendly and has a nice selection of food and refreshments.  Hot coffee, fancy lattes and the like if you don't want the basic filter stuff.  Baked goods and yummy sandwiches. The staff are laid back and friendly oh and did I mention it's licensed too.  Nice place for a glass of wine on a fall afternoon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, typewriters, local artwork, graffitied washrooms, coffee beans in the counters, a menu board on the ceiling and why haven't you gone yet??
Super neat space it's a loft cafe in the Orange Lofts building in Calgary's East Village. 
The menu board looks like a trap door in the ceiling... But I guess it drops down to write on .. Although I'm still going with trap door!
There's also a bathroom under the stairs with a tiny door inside ... Again I assume for Dobby or small people to live.
The artwork is all local and really cool and I found out its through a neat program in the city which gives the artist 80% I believe you'd have to ask for the specifics..
When you go up to the loft portion there is still artwork hung near the windows so there are actually binoculars set up around the edges so you can check it out!"}
{"text":"Popped in here when I was doing a job in the condo building above. There was a new guy working that had never made a london Fog before. He ended up just throwing the tea bag and vanilla into some steamed milk with A LOT of foam.

No big deal though, once I figured out that it was wrong I went back in and someone else fixed it up for me.

Its a cool space with a loft area above. One of the menus is mounted to the ceiling as there is a lack of wall space at the counter area. The ceiling is very low so hopefully you're not claustrophobic when needing to place your order."}
{"text":"Visually stunning / creative decor. 
Decent food. Friendly service. Great location. Licensed. The drip coffee & Americano was ok but the Latte's lack creaminess, richness that other specialty coffee shops provide. Even though the coffee isn't their strong suit,  this is definitely a really cool place!"}
