{"text":"Very cheap sushi in North York. We came here after a day of shopping at Fairview mall. We were craving sushi but didn't want to settle for macsushi so drove to the closest sushi joint we can find.  You get your moneys worth here. Boat specials for one person starting from $14.99. The specials come with soup, salad, and ice cream.  Lunch specials starting at $4.50.  Portion sizes for sashimi are on the smaller side but you get what you pay for.   Sashimi house is a japanese restaurant that is owned by chinese owners. Unlike other chinese owned sushi houses, they do not try to make themselves look japanese. This was a very wierd experience for me (in a good way) as this was the first sushi restarant that was not ashamed to advertise that they are chinese owned. Instead of japanese accompanying the english descriptions on the pastic menus, each dish was followed by a chinese translation.   The atmosphere in terms of decor and noise level like being at a mcdonalds but with sushi and servers.   Will definately pop back here when I'm in the mood for cheap sushi."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place - not anymore! Really poor customer service and seems to have gotten dirtier! Never would go back here. Owner was also very disrespectful and rude. If you're in the service industry, there should be a level of service that should be up kept. Food quality has also deteriorated. Far too many other places to go for sushi than be bothered to go here anymore."}
{"text":"Other reviews were really mixed, but the food here is pretty good. It was all pretty tasty. It might be a little pricy (I am more used to Sushi/Japanese food prices in Markham).  Place gets super busy at lunch - which ensures it is fresh. They didn't seem to have enough servers, only saw 3 and they were pretty much at full run the entire time. They still managed decent service.  And they openly accept American Express!"}
{"text":"I have been going here regularly for years. I keep returning because the fish is fresh (the slices of salmon sashimi are large), they have good prices and it is my go to place for buying salmon sashimi by the pound when I do takeout."}
{"text":"Decided to have late lunch here since its close by to my bank. Their menu is quite big and have a lot of options to pick. From lunch bento box, to daily specials. My gf got the 'Deluxe bento box' with beef. Basically you get get 3 california piece roll, some tempura veggies, and 2 tempura shrimp, steam rice, and whatever protein you pick. You also get a single scoop ice ice cream at the end.  I got the Yam tempura ($3) for 6 pieces.  Baked Scallop Roll ($9.5) for six pieces. Its spicy sauce with it being baked. It tasted alright.  Deluxe Spider Roll ($14) 8/10 pieces. Envision spider roll but add avocado and eel on top. Tasted nice, definitely justify the price point i'd say.  Amaebi Sashimi ($6) 6 pieces of shrimp. Its quite small. I'd say its better to get that at an ayce where you can gobble loads of these.  This place is quite spacious, and the time we went they were not busy, so they were attentive to our needs (not that we had any). Bill came to $48 before tip.  Definitely worth a visit when you're in the area, service is nice and they're Chinese ppl."}
{"text":"Food is above average, well made and fresh, nice presentation, spicy mayo definitely tasty, great snow dragon roll.  Staff very courteous, polite, and great service.  We had a birthday party here, they accommodated our group nicely, we were able to have our bday cake as well, no problems.  Lunch time is busiest, nights are much better usually."}
{"text":"I like this place because not too many places offer my favourite kind of sushi... ``Spicy-Crispy`` vegetarian (WITH avocado) maki rolls ... mmmm !   their yam tempura is yummy with its extra crispy batter...  they only have ice cream for dessert though..  their sushi might not taste a fresh as say `ten-ichi`s`  but like i said , i`m won over by their SPICY CRISPY !!!!!"}
{"text":"Want to give it three stars as this place is pretty decent and the prices are great for lunch. But today they were out of salmon and tuna at 12:40. WTF?! They said they would substitute with [imitation] and charge the same amount citing \"same value\". My reply...\"not in the supermarket\" they then said at least we're letting you use a credit card we normally have a $10 minimum. My lunch was $9.04 after tax."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant about 2 weeks ago based upon good reviews I saw on another site.  Anyhow, the sashimi was just ok and the ramen wasn't very flavourful.  With that that being said, I probably won't be back as its nothing special.  For the same price I would go to Gonoe Sushi on Don Mills which is where I normally go for Japanese food.  I would say that they did have really good,friendly, and quick service which is surprising as some other reviewers mentioned the poor service."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through JustEat. It's pretty cheap compared to others in the area and delivery was really fast. Food was fresh but quality was mediocre. Nothing special. Not overly impressed not overly unimpressed. Might order again"}
{"text":"When we stepped up to the door and saw the plastic sushi plates in the window, Katie Z and I knew we were in for something truly unique.   (Read: sarcasm)  The ambience: Dime-a-dozen, been there, done that. This isn't a \"come for the atmosphere\" restaurant, it's a \"come for the cheap lunch specials\" typa spot. The service: Decent. Smiles. Timely tea refills.  The food: Not an attraction. The rice was quite chewy and tasted old. Otherwise you can't really mess up an avocado or yam tempura roll; they were supermarket satisfactory. Can't speak for the fish. The edamame was way over salted.   On the plus side, this little joint was close to Don Mills subway station (a 4 minute drive). AND it was crazy cheap - 2.50 for each of my rolls and 2.99 for the edamame. That I can get behind."}
{"text":"I came here for early dinner and ordered a eel bento box for $12.50. the eel was terrible!! it tasted like it had just been taken out of the freezer and microwaved, worst eel i've ever had, not fresh at all. My sister ordered a Tokyo Ramen for $7.99. The soup was so blaaaand. and the sliced bbq pork had no taste.  Bad eel, Bad ramen. I dont think i'll be coming here again for those. maybe the rolls weren't so bad, i don't remember, i was so turned off once i tasted the ramen."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The staff are friendly and treat you like family. I would recommend their don buri bowls. The tofu don is a perfect mix of flavours. The best roll on the menu is the deluxe jumbo spider roll. It is perfect every time. I make a point to try as many sushi restaurants as I can, and in the Gta this rivals all others. Even their delivery comes fresh and delicious. It's hard to find sushi that doesn't taste like Mac sushi in Scarborough, but this is awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night around 6:30PM.   i ordered bento box combo 1. It came with Teriyaki beef, two spring rolls, shrimp and vegetable tempura and one bowl of rice. The shrimp tempura was amazing! The shrimp was fresh and crispy! It came with ice cream, soup and 6 maki rolls (avocado cucumber). No salad. Food was delicious. Not bad for $9.50. I didn't order any raw fish, so i cannot comment on how fresh their fish is. The rest of the items in the menu look reasonable prices.   This place is roomy. 6-7 tables occupied at this time. Maybe its long weekend, not so busy. But customers come in and go. Bright and casual setting. It looks like they have a patio but was not set up for the season yet. Its Cantonese run Japanese food. Great for families with babies (since its really roomy between tables). The waitress came regularly and refill the tea. The washroom was clean. It felt a little rushed that while i was eating my ice cream the bill already came."}
{"text":"Decent. Not the best but relatively inexpensive for Japanese. Lunch is cheap"}
{"text":"We love this place for cheap sushi! It's nothing to rave about by sushi is at par with other cheap sushi / AYCE joints. Prices are cheap and the portions are generous. Gave an extra star since the owners are always very friendly. The boats are not expensive either. I always get the teriyaki beef bento which comes with tempura, and California rolls! Don't forget the ice cream that comes as well"}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood Japanese restaurant. Staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Lots of seating. Parking is a little snug. Food was served quickly and piping hot. Maki rolls were excellent. Teriyaki shrimp and chicken was excellent. Good variety.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I like the place not for the quality, but for the price. I am a sucker for cheap sushi and I can't deny it. I love paying for quality as well but when I am hungry, half-ass quality food that comes with a low price is definitely a deal for me. So in other words, I am definitely a fan of this place.  I work right at the offices across the street from this place and I literally run my butt all the way there on my half an hour lunch break (takes only two minutes) to pick up my takeout order from there. They have an awesome and cheap lunch specials and the rest of the menu isn't bad either. I always get their Spicy Salmon, Tuna Sushi and Salmon Sushi combo for lunch for $5.99! (yes, and that is like 8 pieces of sushi for that price) and sometimes when I feel like splurging a little for lunch, I order their spider roll for like $14.99 i think - which is like my favourite maki rolls and this place is generous when it comes to the soft shell crab they stuff in that shit. If I wanna be a total piggy sometimes, I even order their rice specials too and they start at $6.99 I think?  I have no complaints about this place at all, I definitely will come back and will keep coming back for more, maybe for lunch again tomorrow?   For the rest of the reviewers: I think a little slap of reality in the face is needed for you guys, because honestly, this place is not really a five star quality restaurant and we all know we're just paying like chump change for the food their serving. That is all."}
{"text":"I love the maki rolls here, especially the spicy salmon. They also have pretty good house combos if you're looking for a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for sushi at great prices.  Try the salmon sampler 'L' meal with salmon sashimi, sushi, salmon dynamite, and a salmon handroll for $7.50. Beats the usual bento boxes that you see at every Japanese place in the area."}
{"text":"So. Delicious.   I always skipped past this place since I thought it was a bit dingy-looking and reviews weren't that promising. There's another sushi place near my house that's like this place too and it's just... meh. But I decided recently to try this out when meeting with a high school friend and omg, it was amazing. Let's start with the taste. It's somewhere between decent - great sushi I've had in Toronto. I got the udon one evening and salmon sushi combo the other lunch, and was mostly impressed with the cleanness and great service. I don't ask for much service but they are impeccable in a unique way. They'll keep filling your tea. They're fast. Sometimes they're rude (bumped into this guy, said sorry and he just sighed and looked at me and moved on) but... well, they're Asian and they aren't Japanese. Lol. But here's the key moment: when I got my leftover udon for takeout, they separated the noodles and soup and tempura. I thought that was so thoughtful to make the noodles not soggy. That extra step made me come back for lunch where I got salmon sushi combo, and was surprised with relatively fresh sashimi. The maki was alright (the nori was chewy... strange) and the spicy salmon roll was yummy, but MM that sashimi! My friend got one of the boats and looked really full to polish it off herself. I tried a little but not too much :P   I also love how affordable it is. For example, you can get agedashi tofu for $3 and my salmon sushi combo was $9. I think the udon was $12? Either way, I will def be back soon!   PROS:  Cheap + yummy Get their sushi and sashimi and udon Thoughtful service  CONS: Caution against their maki and bento (makis aren't very tasty, and bento always looks not very aesthetically pleasing)"}
{"text":"I am big on Customer Service so when I see the waitress being friendly to my children and trying to accommodate them.  It is much appreciated!  Their tea refills are quick and they come by once in a while to see if there is anything I need.  I think the food is good.  I have never gotten sick over it and my kids love the california rolls.  Bento boxes are nice and cheap as well."}
{"text":"This is just one of your average sushi joints, not amazing but not bad either.  Had the 5A party tray ($30/40 pieces) and the spicy scallop roll, everything was pretty decent, nothing spectacular.  You won't find any special cuts of sashimi here like otoro.  Service was very good, waitress always had our cups full of green tea.  Prices are pretty good when compared to the others around the area."}
{"text":"My last visit here sucked. I suggested to my mom and brother to come here after my great experience the first time. We came on a weekday around 5pm. My brother ordered their Sashimi plate and it was pretty pathetic. The presentation was horrible and put on a shitty looking plate, size of Sashimi prices way too small for the price, and on top of it all, they ripped him off 2 salmon Sashimi pieces. The waitress seemed annoyed that we brought it up. No apology or anything. I noticed the sushi chefs laughing about it too. Not impressed my second time around."}
{"text":"After returning home from work, my fiance and I decided to order in just because it's Valentine's Day and a lot of places are either already all booked up weeks ago or simply aren't taking any reservations. We decided to order from Sashimi House because, well, it's only 10 minutes away.   We ordered the Salmon Bento and the Teriyaki Chicken Bento. It took them literally 1.5 hours + to have it deliver to our place which as mentioned above, 10 minutes away. I had to call them twice to follow-up with the order before the food were delivered. The price was very reasonable but the quality was very mediocre. The salmon was extremely tiny and the tempuras were soggy upon arrival. Customer service was pleasant - the lady answering the phone was polite. I think I will just go back to Gal's in Markham next time."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and find the place to be satisfactory. Nothing to rave abiut but no real problems with the food either. Just a safe bet sushi spot.  The staff has turned me off of the pleace though. I'm a vegetarian, I started the order by stating this and inadvertently seemes to have ordered a bento box with shrimp in one square. Now, no biggie my bad. I asked the server, to take it and just please remove the contents of that square. The steaming mini, frozen ten minutes ago pile of unwanted food was unappetizing to me in that moment. She goes \"why? Just eat it I'm going to have to throw it out, I can't use that again.\" I again asked her to just scoop it off the box and she told me it was a waste of food. Needless to say, there was a lot of wasted food because I was puttl off of my appetite. I changed my review from a 3 to a 1 while writing this. That's how strongly I felt about the interaction.   I have not been back since nor will I be"}
{"text":"I've passed by this plaza for years and have never thought to go in until recently. Unless you live around there, you really have to make a point to go to this plaza in order to eat here. We finally decided to try it out one night and I have to say, it really wasn't that bad and met my expectations. It's a lot bigger inside that it looks from the restaurant front (which really is the back) that faces Sheppard.  We got one of the boat specials which also came with soup, salad, dessert and shrimp tempera, and added in a chicken teriyaki bento box. The value is definitely pretty good."}
{"text":"I called for delivery, three potions of Salmon sashimi with rice and two potions of miso soup.  The quality of salmon is average, nothing can complain. But they did not have me enough soy sauce, the miso soup tasted bland."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced. We eat here once a week. Very fresh 90% of time. Only negative is the interior is a little \"blah\". It's not very intimate. Feels like high school cafeteria. But food is great. Great delivery."}
{"text":"Okay, when you walk into a restaurant and it smells like bleach, it's best to just leave.  My cousin and I came in here, and despite the bleach smell, we were super hungry and stayed. We ordered some rolls and a katsu udon to share and some miso soup and salad. The soup and salad were fine, but the rolls were small. They also weren't super tasty. The katsu was good (served on the side and crunchy), but the udon soup was bland. VERY bland. Contemptuously bland.  Service was friendly, but unfortunately, it couldn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have tried almost all the places accessible within my lunch break. Sashimi House is more or less what I expected: yet another Chinese run sushi place with nothing special, but you wouldn't mind coming for a meal anyways if you want your standard fare. Good amount of seating. Pretty good service (for a Chinese place).  I had their lunch specials. It's not the best sushi/bento box/whatever out there. It's not cheap or expensive. Everything they do is just standard. Which can be ok. With Sushi places almost as common as finding a Starbucks, this is a restaurant that I would consider only if I happened to be in the area and want sushi (unless you want the crap from a mall food court).   I will probably come again. There's only 1 other sushi place in the area so not a lot of options if I want sushi. And the other place even more expensive."}
{"text":"I don't come her very frequently but I've been going to this place for years and years and I love it. It's an affordable a la carte place where I can always find a table. The staff is very nice and there are tons of options. Sometimes if someone gets a miso soup in part of their meal then they'll give everyone a miso soup at the table which is a nice bonus I've never had anywhere else."}
{"text":"I always pass by Sashimi House but have never tried it until recently. It's been around for a while.   There's miso soup, which is a bit on the salty side. There's no salad.  The sushis only 3 pieces. Everywhere else I go there's 6 pieces.  I got the beef teriyaki bento box for $11. It was good. They do include 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura.   At least there's ice cream. Everything is average. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it's close to work and on the way home. Good place, lots of seating, really clean. Service is pretty good and quick. Servers are friendly.   Food is good. I suggest trying out their daily specials. All specials come with miso soup. Me and my BF have been going here, and we keep coming back due to the food and service.   Today I tried their beef ribs bento box special for $10. It comes with beef ribs, rice, spicy salmon roll, miso soup, and green salad. Definitely a must-try. Beef ribs are tasty and it's good value for what you pay.  Sushi tastes great and miso soup is good too.  Over-all no complaints and this is my go-to place in the area if I feel like sushi after work."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the past 4 years but this time was VERY DISAPPOINTING. Wanted a treat for Friday dinner so we ordered take-out. The cashier was appallingly rude (to say the least). No customer service, no hospitality. She made it very clear we were disturbing her by giving them business. VERY DISAPPOINTED is an understatement. I did not want to be this upset for a Friday night."}
{"text":"These guys and gals deserve two thumbs up. Nothing exciting but cheap, fast, and good. It is fills you quite well. Best Asian in the area where I am located!"}
{"text":"This is a good place! Price is very reasonable and the sashimi is really fresh. I like the their 5a party tray. Lots of choices of sushi and sashimi. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"it feels like entering a house. interesting experience. Good service. Good food. Probably it is part of the experience to make you feel like home. Friendly manager."}
{"text":"Close to Fairview mall, Eastbound along Sheppard Ave, Sashimi House has been here for over 20 years as per what we were told. Coming back from vacation, and meeting up with one of my friends, I was craving sushi badly.  SH interior is quite spacious, and if you're lucky, during their summer time they've got a patio! which is a big plus in my books.  The cleanliness of the place was rated at 4/5.  The service we had was exceptional and well knowledgable when it came to decision making.   The food! firstly, the presentation was up to my standards.  Both my friend and I ordered a whole list; salmon sushi, avocado sushi, california, spyder, and zuchinni avocado. All dishes were successful according to my taste buds!  Overall the place is great! but i'll definitely be back in the summer to try out more dishes, my rating is a 3.5....so hence a 4!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here forever, mostly b/c it's super close to my mum's house.  Their lunch specials are particularly good value.  I don't think it's super great quality sushi, but it does the trick when you need a sushi fix!"}
{"text":"First delivery try went fairly good. Got the spicy salmon and tuna. Also the 15 pieces of sashimi. Twas satisfying. However the shrimp tempura/vegetable did not taste fresh. Mostly due to the tempura. I would rate the first outing 3.5-4."}
{"text":"I am finding that sushi is sushi in most sushi restaurants in Toronto! But this one has points above others: lunch menu specials are varied and the dishware they use is so pretty!  It also gets points docked for size of sushi...While it does fit in my mouth, it just feels too small and unsatisfying at the end of the day.  The service is very good for large parties."}
{"text":"Taking class in the area and search some Asian food nearby. The don I tried is abit more sweet than the normal one but I prefer sweetness. Sashimi is fresh too. Service is very god too."}
{"text":"Simple sushi restaurant with a storefront facing the main street but it's main entrance facing the internal parking lot. There is plenty of tables so it's good for larger groups, but expect to wait because the service is hit and miss. We came on a night that they were short staffed so we had to flag down service for tea a couple times, and they never came back with our change after paying the bill. They were apologetic about the situation, and we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big problem. But it could easily upset someone else's meal.  For the food, there is nothing absolutely amazing. The menu carries all the staples of a typical sushi restaurant, the quality is passable and the portions are good. You can find a bento box dinner with miso soup and icecream for $11 so it's not a bad place to cure a sushi fix or a quick dinner. My bento box came with 3 pieces of California rolls, which were not done particularly well.....all I could taste was avocado which is weird when eating sushi."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Spent two hours waiting for tray 5A to show up with less than half the pieces advertised.  Never ordering from here again !  Said the gps sent him to Scarbrough when they are only 1.4km from my house!  Rude staff that doesnt speak English. They just kept saying that it will arrive in 15-20 minutes"}
{"text":"My friend told me that this place was great for lunch.  The combos are \"totally worth it.\"  My other friend was craving for sushi, so we decided to go to this restaurant since a) I've never tried it; b) we were in the area; and c) my friend recommended it.  So we went.   Granted, the combos were really really cheap and worth it. However, we weren't feeling bento boxes.  We wanted sushi.  There were some different kinds of sushi combos.  I ordered House B, and my friend had House D.  The House B combo included assorted sushi (including salmon, shrimp, and fake crab), a california roll (6 pcs), spicy salmon roll (6 pcs), and a crispy avocado hand roll.  This combo also included miso soup, salad, shrimp tempura (and some vegetable tempura), and ice cream.  My friend's House D combo had this weird grilled chicken sushi maki; however, she said it was okay.  So understandably, it's really cheap and worth it for lunch.  Cost me about $20 for alllll that.  It was quite filling.  However, the sushi quality wasn't the greatest.  I was saying to my friend that I could have made the sushi myself!"}
{"text":"Amazing bang for your buck! For the price you pay, you get great sushi and bento box options. Definitely going to be a top list for me!"}
{"text":"3 stars is about right Nothing is amaZing nothing is horrendous I got a yam roll- pretty good Yam avo roll- skimp on avocado for sure Phili roll- for my husband but the menu dosent say it has avocado in it and we forgot to ask- hes allergic so it didnt get eaten. Their menu is non descriptive so ask about all ingredients. Then we got yam appetizer tempura- so so We got crispy beef roll- its like shredded beef with some tempura bits- drenched in teriyaki sauce- not good at all. And we got the crispy tempura chicken app- also not good. Delivery took 1 hour 15 mins (we are only 10 mins from the resto) It all came to 40$ Which is fine. But nothing was great. Dont think I would want to eat here again."}
{"text":"This is still my go to restaurant. They have expanded into the Alara Restaurant location next door in the same plaza at Sheppard Ave. East and Brian Drive."}
{"text":"Yesterday, the family wanted to take out my Hakka Wife for her birthday so we decided to go to my sisters-in-law's favourite sushi place... Sashimi House on VP & Sheppard.  I order the Salmon special along with one order of Unagi BBQ Eel.  The sushi did take a tad of time to come and when it did, it was fresh.  The Unagi BBQ Eel and Spicy Salmon roll were my favourites.  Although, the Spicy Salmon had chunks of white fat in it.  Flavour, right?  Can't go wrong with a spritz of soy sauce and crumbles of wasabi.  MMM!  The waitress was always smiling and very nice.  Came over to our table often to check up on us, fill our tea and waters which was good.  Everything was A-OK.  Not blown away and did not detest going.  It was a good time and I enjoyed eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered kino (crab) salad, and it was 7 dollars and the portion that they provided was not even worth above 3 dollars honestly and I've been in Japanese restaurants that they've had kino salads and they were a lot more portion for less amount of money. this is ridiculous. I wish I could've gotten my money back for this but it was delivery but don't buy from this place again, they're too over priced for whatever portion they're providing and it's not even that fresh and literally sticks together which the content is not suppose to be sticky"}
{"text":"I went in one night to get take-out because I was really really craving Japanese food.  I decided to get their spicy salmon roll and their chicken teriyaki bento box.    Wait time on the Friday night was absolutely ridiculous.  I think it took them about 35-40 minutes to make my food.  However, the woman did apologize and said they were really busy.  However, I was playing Candy Crush the whole time in the corner waiting and they weren't actually at full capacity in the restaurant itself.  I did, however, notice that a lot of people were calling in for delivery or pick-up.    I question about the hygiene of the place because at one point, a waitress dropped her table wiping cloth on the floor and picked it back up.  I *think* she put it in the laundry but I was actually way too scared to look so one can only assume.    Enough people creeping and now the food.  The spicy salmon roll was actually pretty good but it doesn't stand out.  I wouldn't say it's better than any other restaurant that I've been to.  The chicken teriyaki bento box was okay.  I did particularly like their tempura sauce because it was actually quite flavourful and I ended up using it on my teriyaki chicken that really lacked flavour.  I do dislike the fact that they gave me a tiny piece of chicken on a really really big bed of sprouts and basically glorified \"chop suey\".    Overall, this place is okay if I'm super desperate for sushi."}
{"text":"My favourite is the lunch all salmon set. Great price and very filling.   Understaffed most of the times I'm there so it takes longer to get the cheque. The food is pretty good, not the best but good for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here after a drink across the street for a light dinner. Thinking a chirashi is always a good option, boy was I wrong. I believe the sushi chef butchered the fish wrong so the fish ended up having the wrong cut and hacked up. When I saw my chirashi I was shocked by how it was presented and they dared to serve that dish. It's like going to a steak out and ordering a T-bone but they ended up giving you minced beef - its that bad. BF had the small love boat and it was just as bad. He was scared to eat the fish because it didn't seem fresh and it looks even more hacked up than my Chirashi. I guess you get what you pay for.   The ambiance is comfy and they have two TVs on which kind of reminded me of a pub instead of a sushi place? The servers were alright, nothing to scream about.   I wouldn't recommend this place for its food, it's probably fair to say I have had better overnight takeout Japanese food (sans sushi) than this place."}
{"text":"I was prepared to write a rave review about Sashimi House before I went to dine there but now I'm glad I waited because wow, this place has gone downhill in the last year! I was seriously craving sushi and decided to pop in here for dinner with a friend after work. They have a new menu now and I think there might be more offerings in terms of bento boxes. I think the prices may have been raised a dollar or two as well.  Anyways, this place has been frequented by me a lot and I even had one of my birthday dinners here last year. Sashimi House has always served as a place for cheap but satisfying lunch. I always get the bento boxes which have never disappointed but my last dining experience was pretty horrible.  My friends cup was dirty, there was a fly in her rice and the teriyaki was not only lukewarm but also extremely bland, tasteless and watery. The sushi here has always been somewhat sub-par with the rice being hard and they even cut down on the amount of sushi they give you per bento box! Service was still good but the food was very lackluster.  When it came to the bill, I had to go up to the counter to pay with my Visa and the server hovered over me the entire time. I had made up my mind that all these issues meant no tip because these were 3 majorly big problems imo. When we were getting ready to leave, our server came over to collect our boxes and rudely informed us that service charges were not included in the bill, making it sound like we broke a law. As I recall, tip wasn't mandatory and based on the time we had at their establishment, I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"For the price this place is alright. A hot lunch spot for the corporate offices around. I recommend the combo boxes that give you a good bang for your buck. Comes with miso soup, ice cream, tempura, spring rolls and a main dish."}
{"text":"We've been here many times, mostly coz it's cheap and close by! However having said that, this is probably the last time we'll eat here!  After ordering the \"favourites tray\" which consists of Salmon sushi 4 pcs, red Dragon Roll 6 pcs, Green Dragon Roll 6 pcs, Spicy Salmon Roll 6 pcs, spicy Tuna roll 6 pcs, California Roll 6 pcs...34pcs $36 Yes it's cheap but only if u want fish bone in your roll!  Yes you read that right! Found an actual FISH BONE within its Spicy Salmon roll!  When i tried to tell the waitress, she just said, \"Oh sorry! Probably coz the chef couldn't see very well! Good thing it was you that found it and not Caucasian customers\"  Seriously?!? Wtf?!? So just cause we are Asians?  She offered to pack it up for us when we asked for the bill, I said no thanks don't want anymore bones in my rolls! She did however offer us complimentary Ice Cream... Oh and perhaps cause she felt guilty for her nonchalant attitude at the end she offered us a 10% discount for nearly choking on the fish bone!"}
{"text":"My group of 3 ordered the Shoyu Ramen, a bento box, and a vegetable tempura udon.   When everyone finished their meal, the server quickly came to take away our plates and gave us our bill right away without us asking! It felt like they were kicking us out, which didn't make sense because it wasn't like there were people waiting for our table.... the restaurant was empty.  But it was okay, we didn't mind leaving. The thing was though, when we asked the server to split our bill she was really annoyed. She basically said \"you didn't say you wanted the bill separate when you sat down\". That threw us off... since when were you supposed to sit down and inform the servers right away that you were paying separately??? But anyway, I guess she realized how rude she was acting because she came back and asked us to calculate the separate prices of our meals ourselves. Unprofessional, but sure.  When the server noticed my friend didn't give his tip yet, right away she came up to me and asked me to tell him (even though he was sitting right across from me) to tell him the tip wasn't included in the bill. What I didn't understand was why she was asking me to relay the message to my friend when she could've directly spoken to him BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER? Not cool.. it sounded like she wanted us to shame our friend or something. I've never gone to a restaurant where something like this happened so it was quite a shocker.  Overall, the food was alright. My ramen was about $10, and it filled me up so that's great. The service, on the other hand, is making me re-think whether I want to go back in the future."}
{"text":"Sashimi House has lunch special starting at $5.99 which is not bad.   Quality for the fish is quite good... as my lunch specials though does not come with any salad or miso soup..   Spicy Salmon Roll/Salmon/Tuna ($5.99)  - 6 pieces of Spicy Salmon roll has quite a bit of salmon and Tempura bites  - Salmon and Tuna are both standard  - Rice has a good balance of vinegar, nice and bouncy chew...  For this price point when compare what I get from T&T supermarket, this is much better..   Service wise.. is cold and efficient... The waitress are Cantonese speaking. Most people here for lunch are working in the area and the restaurant was half filled.   Sashimi house is not bad as a cheap quick sushi fix but would not be the one that I will bring or recommend my friend if they want really good Japanese food!  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. Most recent time, the food was terrible. Fish was not fresh and rice was mushy."}
