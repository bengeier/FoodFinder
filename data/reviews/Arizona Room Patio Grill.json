{"text":"Trivia on Tuesdays is great.
If you are there to play and not eat DO NOT expect the server to want to bring you soda or water. She will act like you don't exist because she thinks she won't get a tip. When I take someone's table for an extended period of time I tip them what they would get for about 3 tables. This was not the case for my waitress. I didn't give her a penny because she ignored me and seemed irritated that we weren't eating, most people are there for trivia night not to eat dinner. I got up to get my own drinks from the bar and ask for refills. Her loss, could have made $30 for an hour and a half use of her table but instead she got nothing."}
{"text":"Went to watch the UFC fight at the Arizona Room last night with my family and we all enjoyed the food, the comfortable seating, the nice staff (manager checked on us two times) and the prices were Great for the taste and portion sizing.  Can't complain about yummy quesadillas and nachos for about $6 each.  Burgers were great, too (my aunt and uncle said so).  We ordered the sopapillas for dessert (just ok) and the churros with ice cream (ok also).  Great place to watch sports on a big screen and eat and great food for a great value."}
{"text":"Went to the UFC fight event this weekend pretty excited about a night out at the casino.  WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had there.  
They used to have good food here but they changed the menu and now there are only 13 items on the menu including sides and desserts.  And none of them are even appetizing.  
Then halfway through the fight the volume shot up to near heavy metal concert levels so we couldn't even talk at our table anymore.  I saw people tearing up napkins and shoving them in thier ears.
These guys need to get thier game together because they just lost all my future business."}
{"text":"Place is open and nice. Seating is comfortable wherever you sit. Only problem was we sat at our table for 15 mins and I'm not sure but there was nobody to wait on us. I figure we needed to go to one of the two bars to order drinks but noticed one bar had nobody there. We finally just left without ordering anything."}
{"text":"I had the Nachos with Carne Beef for an extra $2. Very little beef and what I did find was dry. Cheese was tasteless but guac and salsa were good. Good service and the waiter brought out chips and mango salsa while we waited. My husband said his burger was good except the patty was thin."}
{"text":"The food is still running slightly above average, but not as great as in previous years. The best part of the meal is usually the free chips and three salsas. On this visit, two of us tried the patio grill burger. The burger patty was very even thinner than IN and Out and was more bun than meat. I guess it reminded me of a fancy fast food burger due to the Brioche bun. The fries were very good as they were dusted with some spices. Most other items got average reviews including fish n chips, quesadilla and pulled pork sandwich. Prices are still reasonable, but will try a different item next time if I return."}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour most days. Today we came in to watch some football and have a few drinks and snacks. Order the green chilies stew if you get the chance, its delicious.  Today we also ordered the guacamole and chips. Yum."}
{"text":"Service at the bar suck! That's being nice about it. If you are not a regular, then you get overlooked for an obscene amount of time. As if the bartender is thinking, \"If I ignore her, she will eventually go away\". Wrong! I'm toughing this one out Boo-Boo! The bartenders card EVERYONE! So what if you look without a shadow-of-a-doubt like you're 75, you are getting carded. AND if by chance, your bartender takes a break and rude bartender #2 fills in, you get carded AGAIN. So freaking what if you have an open tab and an empty glass in front of you. Bring those credentials back out baby.  \"It' for his own peace of mind.\" 

On a positive note, the Ceviche was out-of-pocket!!! I will put up with the rudeness of the staff just for that Ceviche! The Arizona burger, however,  was not so great. ...Reminds me of Wendy's square, flat-behind burger. The only thing that saves me from talking more about that sorry burger was those seasoned fries. They were hot and tasty! So, to recap... Service is non-existing, but take a chance!  The food is hit or miss! Lol. You're at a casino right!

County dancing is taught on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Dance lessons are awesome! It's a great group of people, including the instructor! The band that plays on those nights are good too."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about both Arizona Room Patio & Grill and their fiery band: Original Impulse!

I'm a regular at the tribute shows at Casino Arizona and this business is also located inside the casino.  Immediately after a tribute show has ended, I may walk on over to the Az Room and this last Saturday I was thrilled to come across the incredible sounds of Original Impulse again! They are extremely talented, professional and ooooh M Gee!!!! They can ROCK tha house!  I wasn't able to stay throughout there entire performance since friends of mine had to call it a night and that would have left me solo.  

This band is well liked and I would love to bring a lot more people into this place when they are performing. There is NO cover charge and Az Room is gorgeous, with super yummy food with EXCELLENT staff representatives: Sanjay-Manager and Becky a sweetheart server, both were attentive and very enjoyable and easy to speak to. I have been to this place a couple of times and each time has never disappointed. My friends and I had their quesadilla and opted for chicken. It was delicious and I was like what, all of this to share with friends for ONLY $4.50?! 

Arizona Room has a lot going on for itself and I am looking at posting a Yelp event in the NEAR future to dance the night away with Original Impulse. Although, I was relayed that Sapphire Sky is very good, I cannot vouch for them yet; since I haven't experienced them. Stay tuned on the Yelp \"events\" page for my posting in September! :)"}
{"text":"Our server Chris is always our guy. He busts his butt and is always on top, as much as he can be. They always seem a little understaffed but it's not terrible. Food is great and inexpensive which is great. It's nice to be able to take a break from the Smokey casino to grab some nice grub without all the smoke. If you're looking for good food, Arizona Room is a good choice!"}
{"text":"The service here is really bad. I asked what the soup was and the waiter said \"I don't know I think they quit making it\". It was only 6:45pm really!  We ordered quacamole it came out fast but had no flavor it might as well been just an avocado. Ordered two margaritas and dinner. The dinner was better but service still sucked our drinks were almost done didn't ask if we wanted another. Finally checked on us and then ask if we needed another drink. We were done eating at this point. I would find another place to spend you're hard earned money this place is not worth it."}
{"text":"Street Tacos were cold. They didn't even throw the tortillas on the grill. Ordered ice tea at bar they actually squeezed the lemon in the drink?. Who does that? Then the bar tender didn't know what was on the street tacos. Ok could have been new. Tried ordering peach cobbler ala mode. She didn't know what I was talking about. I do not recommend this place or the place right infront. Their idea of ala mode is just throwing ice cream on top. Pie was ok but not warmed up with cold ice cream rate it a 4 maybe out of 10. See this place off freeway keep going."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's impressive when you walk in (compared to the dated carnival that is Casino Arizona) modern, open, good amount of seating and beautiful open air patio with sliding glass doors. That's about where the good ends. I had a party of 15. I'm not sure if our server was the ONLY server in the entire restaurant or ????? Our drinks took forever to get. So much so that half of our party ended up just go directly to the bar, rather then wait for her. The table across from us went and spoke to the manager regarding their nonexistent server.. right behind her my husband had a word with him as well. All that did was give our server a pissy attitude. AWESOME!! Perfect Birthday party. 

The appetizers were really good. We tried 1 chicken & 1 steak quesadilla and a couple steak skewers. Food was super tasty! Drinks were terrible -- WEAK. I thought maybe it was just mine, so I had my friend (that's a non-drinker) try my vodka tonic and she said it tasted like.. TONIC -- FROM A NON DRINKER?! The entire table said their mixed drinks were terrible. We all decided to go into the casino and find a bartender that would pour a decent drink. 

The topper -- We all closed our tabs and left. Later that night one of my friends mentioned that a 15% tip was already included in everyone's bill.... Wait WHAT? WE ALL TIPPED HER DOUBLE because we didn't read the receipt ((we just wanted to LEAVE)).

I dislike writing bad reviews because I know how hard it is working in the food industry. Everyone has an off day and perhaps they were down a few servers, but I really don't appreciate it completely effing up my birthday. Super disappointed with the entire experience."}
