{"text":"Not very impressed with atmosphere and up keep.  Seems like want to be nicer place but they don't take care of the place.  Server was not very experienced. Actually came back to the table saying she wrote down our order ,which she didn't, but couldn't read her own writing.  This was after 10 minutes after ordering the first time.   They did have a large party in the event room. So might be the reason for the bad service.   Kids ordered standard  chicken fingers and Mac n cheese. Man n cheese looked like right out of kraft box.  Kids were hungry so ate and said everything was fine.   I order the Hawaiian burger which was okay. Nothing exciting.  My wife had the wrap and said it was good.   Outside seating is nice  except smoking area that was next to us. Place has potential but doubt we will try it again unless see at lot of very good reviews."}
{"text":"Went here with a restaurant.com certificate for my daughters 12th bday.... A wedding reception was going on at same time.. We witnessed an extremely drunk girl, who DID NOT look old enough to be served, stagger thru restaurant to the bathroom.. Said bathroom was then closed due to vomit, we had to go outside to use bar bathroom. Went back in and while finishing our mediocre (at best) meals, witnessed the ems being called and the drunk girl being taken out on a stretcher. Horrible experience, service, food and my young kids had to witness the incident with an overserved guest."}
{"text":"Don't. Eat. Here. The word I would to describe Grazie is \"indifferent.\" The service was indifferent, the food was indifferent, the d√©cor was...indifferent."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would!  When my husband's outdoor 40th birthday plans got changed at the last minute due to the weather Mike (the owner) and his staff were more than happy to accommodate our party and our guests when I called.  We were given a big area for our group of 30+ guests, a table for gifts and the service was WONDERFUL!  A few of us ordered dinner before most of the guests arrived and we all loved our meals!  I can't recommend the apple walnut salad and meatball salad enough- SO GOOD!  The girls that were on duty that night were on top of everything as well.  To have a party as large as ours thrown on you at the last minute could have been challenging for anyone, but they made sure that we all had a drink in hand (even me and I was only drinking water all night!), they informed everyone when the kitchen was closing to get all last-minute food orders taken, and our tabs were ready and delivered within minutes of being requested.    If you're looking for a great place for dinner or a party you MUST consider Grazie.  From the venue, to the food to the service, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. The place was empty on a friday at 6pm. Not a good sign. Walked in and seated ourselves as the sign said. The table was covered with crumbs and dried on food. We waited 10 min before anyone came to our table. There didn't seem to be anyone tending to the dining room. Someone did come in and answered the phone but paid no attention to us. After a while I thought I should call their phone to ask for service. Just as I was dialing the waiter came over. We ordered mussels and crazy bread for an appetizer. The mussels were good but the crazy bread, a Grazie favorite, was a hoagie bun opened up cut into sections with butter and cheese. Very disappointing.  The other food was under-whelming. Fish tacos, Italian hoagie, buffalo chicken sandwhich...blah. Not terrible but just.ok. Once the waiter came in the service was good. Waiter was friendly and another waitress helped out. Service is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. This mediocre experience surprised me. This restaurant is in a nice area in the same building as the Oxford club. There is a great bar in the back called the cabana bar too. I'm not sure how you can stay in business with a restaurant like this in such a competitive market."}
{"text":"What an amazing staff they gave us for our benefit dinner!  Every request was met with a smile and timely action. The set up was marvelous. The pasta, meatballs, fresh bread, salad, and beverages hit the spot and received compliments from many guests. I can't say enough about how the staff contributed to an overwhelmingly successful benefit dinner."}
{"text":"The food was a slight grade above Eat 'N Park.  Our waitress was nice but on a Friday, not a soul eating there but us.  Interesting venue though....."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner and I was excited to visit the place since I had herd many good things about it (especially for the location/outdoor patio).  Starting with that, the place is ideal for a summer dinner, with a huge outside patio that sets the mood right.  Other than this though, I feel that the specific restaurant is not something special.  The service is mediocre - slow and at times nonexistent as well - while the food is at best \"ok\" (at least what I tried and what I heard from the other people I went with).  I ordered a turkey wrap.  How can someone mess up a simple turkey wrap!?! The tortilla was for sure stale, while the turkey itself had a weird taste, as if there was some type of alcohol in it (beer I would say - and I did not have alcohol with my dinner :) ).  It might have been just my palette, but I am not sure if I will be going back to this place, unless there is a group occasion I will have to attend."}
{"text":"Went to a large fundraiser and they do an excellent job with logistics and with handling large groups.  There were some things here and there, such as the enchiladas were cold, but in general the food was delicious.  The wait staff is attentive and prompt.  There's plenty of free parking available."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Had a Groupon so thought we would try it. Can't tell you how it is because we never got waited on. The place was empty except for a guy at the bar. No waitress no bartender.  No one! Sat there for a good while , then just left. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"No complaints from this guy. Beer was fresh and cold, served with a smile and without having to ask.  Wings were fantastic, loved the dry Cajun rubbed ones the most.  Fresh mussels and delicious flatbread to round out the meal. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a business dinner here a short while ago. Food wasn't the worst, nor was it the best. I can see how this place is a convenient place for a family to gather during the cold winter months after playing tennis or engaging in other activities, but I would not necessarily make the effort to come here unless I had another reason to be in the Sports Club complex. That being said, the staff were very friendly and attentive, and seemed to make a sincere effort to treat our group well. I think that if you wanted a sandwich and a beer, it would be a reasonable stop... then again, My Big Fat Gyro is basically across the street, and that place is awesome... Hmmm."}
{"text":"My family loves Grazie and we've been coming here for years. Excellent food and outstanding service! The outdoor seating is great too. I highly recommend this place!"}
