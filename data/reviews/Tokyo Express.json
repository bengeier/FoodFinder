{"text":"Maybe I was just unlucky the first time I went here, but I got teriyaki chicken and the california sushi roll when I was nearly starving, and I couldn't finish either.  The chicken was overcooked and just tasted ... weird.  The sushi roll had like a 10:1 ratio of rice to imitation crab meat.  The only way I'll go back is if someone has a great recommendation for me to try there."}
{"text":"Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but I've got no idea what.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But that's ok.

The food was right on, and I'll be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?  

The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about 5 minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list."}
{"text":"Yuck. The sushi I had was about 90% rice, with some microscopic peices of meat & avocado. The Thai Beef bowl tasted horrible. To top it off, they didn't give me chopsticks with my take-out, and the soda was almost all ice. Go to Kyoto if you want good sushi or bowls for a cheap price."}
{"text":"The idea is great, but the food and atmosphere is mediocre. For some reason, there seems to be an odd lack of lighting here. Oh theres plenty of lights, they just arent all on. Also, wouldnt exactly call the place clean. Bathrooms are gross and the whole place just feels unsanitary. The green color with beige color scheme that they chose doesnt help. 

I was feeling in the mood for something sweet, so I got some cake to go with my sushi. The sushi wasnt anything special, but it wasnt bad. Didnt expect more since I sort of see this place as a McDonalds for Japanese food. The cake, however, was just gross and stale. Should not have been served.

Honestly not surprised it closed. the building was run down and I figure they kept most the lights off the save electricity because they just weren't making a profit."}
{"text":"Had never eaten here before and I have a list full of food allergies and I was getting some chicken and rice for my dog. I had a lot of questions and the two employees behind the counter answered all of my questions confidently and were kind as well as patient. We got home to find out how delicious everything was! Definitely will be seeing more of me here!"}
{"text":"i think this is the only place we can get authentic Japanese for in our budget. Oyako is my favorite. I wish they don't over cook eggs, but rice is cooked nice moist (not watery) , Sauce is lite sweet but tasty,    Green tee is good for refresh. this Carot cake is very yummy."}
{"text":"Well the food was good though it took 15 min. And no one in the store. The condition of the store has gone down hill over the years. The cleanliness is a major issue in my opinion. May not return."}
{"text":"I really like this place for a healthy post gym meal. Its all about the Terriyaki light and if you can afford the calories - the egg rolls are the best i think ive had."}
{"text":"I think this place recently changed ownership or something.  Menu is reduced and new people are running the show.  Last four times I came for lunch, it was awful!  Slow service, got order wrong (EVERY time) and food seems overcooked or something.  Used to be a favorite lunch place, but not anymore.  :("}
{"text":"Terrible lunch service. Attempted to call in an order and was placed on hold, after 10 minutes I called back and got nothing but a busy signal. Ordered at the counter instead and spent 40 minutes waiting for the food. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not worthy of a stop, continue looking. Rude cashier's favorite answer is no. No to this and that. Choses to not hear requests that she feels are bothersome. Good is meh. Service is substandard."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Tokyo Express but was disappointed when I returned from a long blank in patronage to find that the portions had decreased. Not much change in pricing but an obvious decrease in the portions. I guess everyone is compensating in every way they can. The food was still good and as I remember it."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food restaurant of all time.  Fast, healthy, consistent, quality!  I have been going there for like 25 years.  It's the bomb."}
{"text":"I tried 3 of their sushi rolls....first of all, No Chopsticks? Seriously? The specialty roll with the scallops on top was decent, but the other two, the California and the Shrimp were bland and just so so. I honestly have had better grocery store sushi, for the price they charge. I ordered my Dad the teryaki chicken bowl with veggies. He is eating it, but said it was just ok. This was my first order from this place, and dont think I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Got my food real fast (Express, I guess). Curry rice was over-spiced, not tasty at all."}
{"text":"I love their teriyaki rice bowls. I don't eat Sushi so I have no opinion about that. Great place for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I heart Tokyo Express. I have been coming here ever since I was a little girl, when I would come to work with my parents. Now that I am a big girl, I still come here about twice a month for lunch, sometimes 3-4.

I always order the same thing, teriyaki lite bowl with egg rolls. But today I decided to switch it up & I ordered bento box a. It was ok, the best parts were the teriyaki chicken & eggroll so I think I will just stick to my usual.

The 2 girls up front who take orders are always smiling & super sweet. I have never had to wait more than 5 mins for my order.

Like I said, I heart Tokyo Express!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a change taste in an area stuffed with mexican restaurants. Quick place to grab light and tasty teriyaki."}
{"text":"Decided to give Tokyo Express another try after being recommend by a coworker. Called in the order for pickup and the lady on the phone was being extremely rude. I would place my order and asked her for \"white meat only\". She said very rudely \" Yeah, yeah I know\". She continued taking the order with a bad attitude. In that moment I told her to cancel because I wasn't going to deal with rude staff. This is another reason not to go to a Tokyo Express which was once a great establishment but continues to disappoint."}
{"text":"Our teriyaki chicken was dry and the wait was long. Enough said.

Tried this place a few times before giving review, but each time very disappointed. The place is clean and the staff was there."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tokyo Express since I was a baby with my parents! I've traveled the US and have stayed loyal to there version of the teriyaki chicken!"}
{"text":"The inconsistency really turned me off eating at this particular location. Sometimes the serving portions were tiny;  the amount of chicken on the teriyaki bowl was meager at best. If you can't even pile on the rice to the rim there is something seriously wrong.
Also, the restaurant is not that clean. Take a look at the infant booster-seat that's available - its filthy! I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"Cheap, good, and has a drive through! A rare combo!"}
{"text":"This place is just plain nasty. I tried it once and it was so bad that I took a couple bites and threw it out. Fast forward a year or so- I was in the hood, in a hurry for lunch and craving Japanese but needed something quick so thought I would give it another try. Nope, bad idea. Got it to go, went back to the office, took a bite and in the trash it went again. I lived in Japan for years and travel there frequently still. I don't expect this to be up to the standards of what I could get there but I've had school cafeteria Japanese food that certainly beat this."}
{"text":"Their miso soup was cold and SPOILED. They made us another batch that was actually hot and no longer tasted a few days old, but still nasty. Their teriyaki chicken was also salty."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  Have been going here for 25 years with great, consistent service and quality - over the last 4 months this place has gone down hill fast.  They reduced their entire menu by 90%, their service is slow and inconsistent and the quality of their food (especially their brown rice) has gone down hill.  They now \"out source\" their California rolls and they are now made with a disgusting \"paste\" like substance that is terrible, they are also now using poor quality seaweed that smells terrible.  The entire place needs a good cleaning and when people walk in they think it is closing.  Very sad for a place that was once very good.  I would eat here 2-3 times a week, now it may be 1-2 times a year if they don't focus on quality, service and overall appearance."}
{"text":"I have been getting the katsu chicken from Tokyo express for quite a while now and just tried getting it again and had a terrible experience.   First it took longer then other orders which if that's the case it would be nice to communicate that while I see people who order a few minutes after me get their food before me.   When I checked the food knowing there would probably be a mistake based off of the cashiers actions I noticed the katsu did not look like the usual katsu.   I know they have a sign up stating they are working on their menu but katsu chicken is katsu chicken not Oyakodon like they gave me.   The cashier told me emphatically that it is their katsu chicken so I assumed it might just look a little different now.   Once I got home to eat it I realized it is definitely not katsu.   I called and spoke to the manager and she just went into the fact it is a different version of katsu and that it takes a little longer to cook instead of listening to me.   I added a pic of the so called katsu chicken.   Won't be visiting them ever again and plan to tell everyone I know and work with to stay away from this place.   What a shame"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely awful. Waiting over a half hour for a rice bowl is unacceptable. The product is still the same and I've liked it for over 30 years but the service has about done me in for good."}
{"text":"I have been going here for well over 20 years. They have the best teriyaki chicken around. It is very healthy and it tastes wonderful. They grill the chicken so it has a nice char on it before they put the sauce on. I also really enjoy the sukiyaki bowl. The place is a little old now but it's still really good and very consistent. When I have a craving for teriyaki chicken this is the place I must go to"}
{"text":"Dude.. authentic Japaneese in a crappy strip mall.. it even has a tree growing inside. Its an oasis of goodness in a crazy world.. evrything i try is awesome but the bento is my fave.. the gamazio dispenser is an unprecedented discovery! even i cali i'd not seen one.. This is so awesome! I'm a habitual vistor.. its just that freaking awesome!"}
{"text":"It's not bad.  The oyako and katsu are moist.  They haven't messed up an order yet, which I appreciate.  Their rice bowls are passable, and probably the best I've found for fast food locally, though the portions are not generous.  The inari sushi is good.

They ran out of white rice near closing time once, but I didn't mind having brown rice instead.

The interior is a little dated and tired, but it's been clean whenever I go.  Try to park on the hidden side that wraps around the building, and not in the main crowded area.

I do wish they could find a way to use all the seating for Cherry Blossom in the evening."}
{"text":"Toyko express has been around for 30 years easy and we've been going there on and off for all that time. They are famous for their teriyaki chicken bowls and California rolls. The price has remained reasonable so it has always been a good value. However, the restaurant itself could use an update or even just a good tile bleaching. If I had never  been there before I might reconsider ordering. The staff is quick and efficient but could use some customer service tips like acknowledging someone who is waiting with a \"Hello, I'll be right with you\" or maybe some even some eye contact and a smile."}
{"text":"I use to come here 15 years ago!!

If the rating was based on nostalgia or their incredible salad dressing that I'm sure they packed full of something addictive then 5 stars it would be easily. 

However, it can't be. The dark meat is always always like leather (hard to do) and usually charred black. They charge extra for everything so little as far as sauce, veggies also- all extra. 

I'll drink the dressing in pure bliss but the rest, not good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Great service, Great prices and GREAT JAPANESE FOOD!!!! Just wish they had onion soup!!!! This place is so CLEAN and so Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I miss you Tokyo Express. Ive moved far away. And in my new home their is nothing as good as Tokyo Express. All the teriyaki places here miss the mark in so many ways. 
I loved how convienent and healthy your food is. My favourites are your miso soup, tofu ginger salad, ahi tuna, teriyaki salmon. Also you cold noodle salad. Your mixed vegetables were perfect too. A good assortment of veggies steamed yum!. 
Please come. to Portland or Vancouver. 
Its dire straits up here when it comes to Japanese/teriyaki.  Theirs just nothing around up here like Tokyo Express or like your competitor Yoshi's. Please consider opening  a Tokyo Express here"}
{"text":"Love the chicken katsu with the side of curry. They also have carb-free menu options. Most stuff on the menu is less than $10.

The best part : It's a drive thru!! And you don't have to wait that long for your food."}
{"text":"I will never come to this place ever again. I'm pretty sad and disappointed about it, as this is a nostalgic place for me to go since I've been coming here when I was little. I ordered my usual, teriyaki chicken rice bowl, and after nearly finishing half of it I felt like I was chewing on a piece of hard flexible scrap. When I spit out whatever it was in my mouth I had realized that it was a dirty black piece of fingernail. At first I thought it was a piece of bone or cartilage from the chicken, but after examining closely I realized what I had just been chewing on and I nearly vomited and vowed to never go back. If I could, I would have given zero stars. However, I guess the one star is that they refunded my money back and apologized."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They closed the one by Mesa Community College.  Very disappointing over 10 years ago.  Great authentic dishes and preparation since I've eaten quite a few meals in Japan.  It's cheap and quick.  It will fill you up, but you'll be hungry again sooner than normal.  No alcohol.  Serves different rice and noodle bowls."}
{"text":"Nobody understands. I have this weird affinity for Tokyo Express. But only this particular location. I've been to the other's in Scottsdale and Mesa and they just don't taste the same. Maybe it's because I used to come here for lunch in high school and almost everyday when I  worked at my crappy job down the street. Maybe it's just my nostalgia of growing up here and being young(er)....
Mostly, I just freakin' love the teriyaki bowls here more than any other 'yaki chain. There is never too much sauce, chicken to rice ratio is always perfect and it's always piping hot. What makes it hit the spot? A large Tropical Passion iced tea...ahhh yes...you go home, add a little Sriracha and it's the perfect meal. 
Yes I feel like a loser because it's next to the wonderful Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe and I could get a much better meal there, but when you want something quick and good, this is always my favorite. 
Minus one star due to the ambience changing a bit over the years, it's smaller and they used to have this great English-style red phone booth in there, not anymore. Boo. 
I realize I've just written way too much about Tokyo Express, but nobody understands! Ah well, I will continue to remain loyal."}
{"text":"I went because JohnJay from Johnjay and Rich talked sooo much about it. I got something simple. Noodles, veggies and chicken. And let me tell you.... IT WAS SOOO GROSS. Johnjay said everything is so healthy... but I am pretty sure everything is microwaved here. The chicken was definitely microwaved. Noodles were so plain and veggies were also very plain, no flavor besides being frozen and thawed."}
{"text":"WOW...  this place has horrible customer service!

I will not return here.  Tokyo Express was the place to go in Phoenix for Teriyaki Chicken years ago.  It has changed to a place that does not care about the food, customer or cleanliness.  Sad state that are in.

Why and how can you ruin a place like this?

Beware, In my opinion there are better places out there for Japanese Food."}
{"text":"Worst Asian food I've ever had - nothing Asian about except the name.

I ordered a beef special and a chicken special, neither resembled the photo.

They were bland, the beef looks like and has a texture of pork. The chicken does not taste anything like the description"}
{"text":"I used to love this healthy choice.  They've changed the menu and removed my favorites.  This place is a dump that's changed for the worse.  AVOID!  SAD!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tokyo Express since I was a little girl and they have remained just as good. I freaking love the dressing on the side salad. I always order the terriyaki chicken bowl and 2 side salads. Always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I have not eaten at Tokyo Express in awhile as most of the ones I frequented closed and I saw this one so I thought I take my boyfriend to lunch..well the quality of the food has really gone downhill and the service was slooowww even for lunch..they didn't have change for a 20, the person on the register didn't even have a key to the safe to get change so we had to use plastic..the food took 20 minutes to be delivered to the window and not enough sauce to make the rice taste better it was overcooked..so disappointing w hen this use to  be 5he place to go for good fast Japanese food..I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Not even for the price was it good food. It wasn't particularly bad it was just meh for the price I have had much better. Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of better places to the north and south that are better and, honestly, worth the money. Save your nickels and dimes and cook at home then go to a real restaurant with the savings."}
{"text":"Absolutely, without a doubt, THE GROSSEST excuse for sushi I have ever attempted to consume...
Please, God, remind me the next time that I'm in a hurry and craving sushi, to head to the freakin grocery store!
The rice was oddly wet and smooshed down (I could barely detect that it was rice), the seaweed was mushy, wet and stringy, and my tempura shrimp roll was the size of a woman's fist. 
The whole experience (if one could call it that) was deplorable...
The woman did give me my money back after I took the slop up to the counter, but oh, my God, I can't get that foul taste out of my mouth....
What was I thinking?"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. Now it is plain dirty. Food quality is unpredictable and mostly poor."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tokyo Express for the last 15 years or so, and it's always been amazing. There's something about their teriyaki chicken that just beats everybody else's."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this location for the past 15 years.  I have only eaten the teriyaki chicken meal special which is my favorite it comes with salad and drink.  The chicken is grilled and perfectly seasoned withe the teriyaki sauce served over white rice. The salad is  plain lettuce cucumber and carrots covered with a savory vinegary dressing that is cool and refreshing. LOVE IT!  I usually order a side of egg roll  and or California roll. The egg roll is tasty and just the right size. My last couple of visits the California roll had been dry, don't think I'm getting this anymore.

The only reason I scored this as a 3 star is because the location is out dated. I believe it has not been updated since it was built. I remember going to this chain since I was in high school on the east side of town."}
{"text":"I ordered meals to go . When I got there the parking lot was completely filled . Some moron decided to park in the driveway.  There was one group in front of me but I had to wait 10 minutes while the served the guests before me.. The  chicken we had good but not much sauce so it was a little dry"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to stop by food was good and friendly service. I had the Bento box it has little bit of everything"}
{"text":"This places is nasty the rice is always over cooked and the teriyaki sauce is just to salty the only good thing there is the side salad"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews first! Ordered teriyaki chicken and noodle bowl! Ordered at 12:05 and it's 12:41 now! Not express! Far from express! Apparently I will grow old here waiting my 8.00 bowl!! :/ not happy and wouldn't recommend this place based entirely on the wait!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment:( I have been going to Tokyo Express for about 30 years. I hadn't visited this location in quite a few months and I can guarantee that after tonight it will be my last. When I arrived it wasn't busy. It never really gets that busy. This was at about 6:45 pm. I went to place my order for sukiyaki and Inari. I asked for a container for gomasio, a condiment they have always had and I was told by the woman at the front counter that they didn't have it. They have always had it! Gomasio - black sesame seeds and salt! It's a staple at this restaurant! However I figured it was just a small thing. Then I asked that they not put tofu in my daughter's sukiyaki. She then said we don't use tofu! I looked at her..... I thought am I at Tokyo Express? Sirloin Steak, Tofu, Onion, Rice Noodles, Rice. I've been eating this since I was 11, but okay, still placed my order. I waited and waited and waited. I watched the front counter woman go to the back and help the one cool start cooking. She then came back around to the counter called a couple numbers and went back again. When she came back she started asking the three of us still waiting for our food what our numbers were and what we ordered. When she got to me I told her and she said, \"oh it's ready, it's right here!\" It had been sitting on the counter in a to go bag for a good 5 minutes before she had realized it was for someone sitting in the restaurant waiting. I had waited 30-40 minutes for my food. Thank goodness it was Inari and not California Rolls! Anyway unfortunately it was dry and had a lot of onion in it, more than usual. No green onion either. If I return to Tokyo Express it will be to the on 51st Ave and Indian School."}
{"text":"I called in my order , the meals were ready when I got there. However the rice was  over cooked and sappy, when I brought it to b the cashier attention , she just said sorry snd disregarded me. The meet was also  overcooked"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, so figured I would write a review. This is a great place if you're looking for something fast, cheap,and healthy. I really like their all white meat terriyaki bowl combo, it's fresh and not greasy and pretty good deal with a side and salad for around $6. Their ramen salad is really good too, with a generous portion of ramen noodles, chicken and veggies, it's also super cheap (around $4)."}
{"text":"It has been a while since my previous visit to this place and the meal I had then was far from memorable. Today I decided to give it another try while my car was being serviced at the AAA service facility a block away. I ordered the spicy bento to get a better sampling of things this restaurant offered. The meal was a disappointment: the rice of the sushi had a watery texture, the spicy chicken and spicy beef were overly salty, and the vegetable curry was no more than a starchy gravy with some bits of overly mushy vegetables.  On the positive side, the place is bright and clean and the service is fast. Those are not enough to bring me back, though, since food is the main draw for me as far as dining establishments are concerned."}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised at how far this place has gone downhill! I came in here the other night after not being in for a while, and for how dead they were (every time I go in here, the place is dead, so--how are they staying in business?), the service was inexcusably slow. Isn't this supposed to be \"fast food\"? The manager was unresponsive to my comment to that effect. There was also a cockroach just inside the front door, so maybe the health department should get involved. Also, just yesterday I hit Whole Foods' sushi bar, and for about the same price got a truly fresh product, so I won't be going back into Tokyo anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tokyo Express defined the Quick Service Rice Bowl take out segment a long time ago.  
For over 20 years I have frequented this establishment and been through all of its acquisitions, transitions, growth and downsizing.  One thing remains today: much of what was great is still the same.  The teriyaki sauce is the best (in the early days it was homemade fresh daily), the lemon ginger dressing for the salads should be bottled.
Much of the menu has been duplicated by other similar restaurant concepts and in some cases, done better.  I can agree with the quality of the chicken on the regular rice bowls (dark meat) could be better; rather than raising the prices, lesser quality was chosen which was a shame.
Two decades have allowed me to try everything on the menu and it is all great.  Standard Japanese fare served up quick and hot. Yum.
Maybe its nostalgia but I really love this place and hope it continues to find its niche and endures another 20+ years
Final Rating: 4.9 for consistency for many, many years of quick service and tasty meals; Thank you Tokyo Express."}
{"text":"For the money.....great job! I don't know what I like more, the option to sub white rice with brown or the spa-like music playing at just the right level. The bamboo shades & slatted seats (however counter-service the place is otherwise) really made this eatery feel relaxing and soft and COOL on a warm day :)
I wasn't sure what my taste buds really wanted that day. I played it safe and ordered something I could compare easily to other restaurants: Teriyaki chicken bowl was tasty & lite. I would have used a bit more sauce, but i tend to do that anyway, so maybe it was par for a good bowl presentation. They offer Bento box, some sushi, lots of veggie and fish options, and a kind approach to service with authentic smiles :)

{"text":"Everyone has their favorite fast food Japanese place, whether it is convenient for lunch or your go-to place for takeout.  When I moved to this area, I was sad to leave behind Sakura, and did not think I would find anywhere in comparison.

Then, I found Tokyo Express and I was ecstatic.

Disclaimer:  I am somewhat of a picky eater.  Tokyo has great rice, shrimp sauce, broccoli and chicken.  This is my Plan B, whenever I don't feel like cooking, rainy days, late night, or when I am just plain tired of the traditional fast food chicken nuggets.

Do not confuse this with the Tokyo Express @ Concord Commons, not the same chain (completely different quality of food)."}
{"text":"I remember when Tokyo Express was one of the only places of it's types in Phoenix.  That was when it was over by 36th st and Thomas.  It was better then.  Now it's an ok place.  The food isn't to bad and is reasonably priced.  It's good to stop for a quick lunch.  Plenty of parking is an advantage so you can get in and get out."}
{"text":"In a world where up is down and left is right. Where the Clintons have a chance at a third term in the White House and their greatest opponent is a business suit wearing riches to rags to riches to rags to riches story personified, whom everyone loves to hate. A world where there's hot and there's chicken and there's Thai. The people of Tokyo express decided to take the hot, the chicken AND the Thai, mix them up into one delicious meal and called it \"Hot Thai Chicken\".

That's right mister Trump, I implore you. Please, put up that wall, put it right up around Tokyo Express and never let me leave. I'll be just fine here, eating the world's sorrows and troubles away with this bowl of Hot Thai chicken on my lunch break. It smelts guns in the hands of people everywhere, brings peace in war torn African nations, this bowl can end world hunger. Is there anything this delicious bowl can't do?

Warning, no guns were smelted in the making of this review and the world is still hungry, but if they were to make enough of these bowls of Hot Thai Chicken then maybe, just maybe, Siberian children wouldn't be cold or hungry anymore.

Happy yelping Phoenix, eat more Hot Thai Chicken!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Tokyo Express a lot more when I was younger and cared perhaps a little less about the quality and taste of my food then than my wallet. I still have the occasional desire a few times a year to go and the quality is nothing amazing but I've never gotten sick from their food. The decor is a little drab and probably hasn't changed in over a decade but not dreadful either. Never seen more than one or two customers when I go. The sushi is \"so so\" but I find their chicken teriyaki and my favorite dish the Oyako bowl (white meat chicken with egg and onion) very good. A place to good if you're running short on cash, don't want to eat home buy can't afford one of the good sushi places nearby."}
{"text":"Tokyo is one of the first places I ate at when I first moved here.  It was right around the corner from the school I teach at, so it was our go-to place to grab lunch (before our lunch was shortened to 30 minutes).  

Anyway...you could say I'm a regular.  Or maybe the fact they know my order as soon as I walk in would mean I'm a regular.  LOL.

I get the Teriyaki Chicken Lunch Special every single time I go.  It comes with the little salad and the tasty ginger/soy dressing and a drink.  Sure, this isn't the most spectacular food in the state, but it is just one of those places that I rely on when I am super hungry and know I can get a filling lunch or dinner.  There's something about it I can't pass up.  

I have been to the one near downtown Phoenix and that one was yucky and the staff wasn't as friendly.  My bowl had crunchy half steamed rice, blech!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location at least 10-12 times and have never been disappointed.  The fact that it's been in business so long (early 80's?) certainly says something.  It definitely has that outdated, whitewashed decor with bad fake plants and too much lighting, but the food is solid, fast Japanese and is reasonably priced.  I also like the fact that they have a drive-thru.

I've tried a number of items on the menu including the Sushi combos, chicken/noodle salads and the low carb entrees w/ all veggies and no rice,  however, the last few times I've ordered the Bento Box B.  It offers a nice combination of flavors and satisfies my need for variety and spice.  Served in a somewhat traditional style bento box, it includes Thai Beef Salad (very noticeable heat factor), Teriyaki Chicken, steamed rice/mixed veggies, inside-out California Roll, edamame and a small egg roll which is either pork or beef.  I would also recommend Bento Box A which includes Yakiniku Beef w/ Cabbage, steamed rice/mixed veggies, Teriyaki Chicken, green salad w/ ginger dressing, edamame and an egg roll.  If I'm in the S. Scottsdale area and hungry for lunch, I will usually stop here."}
{"text":"Loved Tokyo Express when I used to visit my brother.  I ate there a lot.  We need them in Atlanta."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch disregarding the not so great reviews. When you first get there it's pretty abandoned looking, but once walking inside I was surprised by how many people were there. I thought, \"GREAT! the reviews are wrong.\"

I ordered a las vegas roll and a teriyaki salmon. When I opened my box that held my roll...I was disapointed. The roll was very pale which normally indicates that it wasn't cooked long enough. I still gave it a try, and I could tase the doughy batter. Once I peeled off the outside of the roll I was left with cream cheese, salmon, and rice. The rice wasn't very good either...After about the third \"piece\" I gave up after my stomach started to hurt. I would not recommend this roll, I would much rather go to RA and spend about the same amount of money on their sushi. 

I haven't eaten the salmon, but from what I was seeing that and the chicken are very popular...Here's hoping when I'm feeling better, they will get an updated review."}
{"text":"If this wasn't my husbands favorite place to eat I probably wouldn't make the drive. Recently they have gone WAY downhill. The owner has basically canceled everything on the  menu and they serve 2 dishes now. It sad, since we have been avid customers for 18 years. There used to be more stores and MUCH better food. I shall miss the curry very much."}
{"text":"First timer and the food was very good! I don't normally eat hole in the wall Asian food due to past experiences but I decided to give this place a try with a positive attitude. I don't regret it one bit. I ordered the teriyaki bowl and a small salad. The salad was a great start, and I love the dressing they use. The teriyaki bowl was very fulfilling, I added extra teriyaki sauce. Might have to give more spots like this a try"}
{"text":"My Cousin turned me on to this place. He likes the Sukiyaki bowls. I tried them and they are pretty good. He told me that this place used to be all over the Valley about 10-15 years ago, but is down to just 2 locations now in the Valley. it does seem a big dated in the restaurant we were at, but the food was good and seems cooked to order.

I doubt we will come back as they are so far away and quite expensive for what you get. Mostly rice with a little bit of meat on top.

Services was 5/5. Food was 3/5. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"This place is not that great. Shogun express has way better chicken teriyaki rice bowls and beyond.
The chicken is what really bothered me here. It was really tough and extremely chewy. And that was the white meat. They're bowls are around 5 bucks which I like, but they're not even filled to the top. 
All in all I came here because Shogun was closed and there aren't any other rice bowl places in Scottsdale that I know of. Eh."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Pre packaged or microwaved. I can't tell which. Either way, horrible quality frozen meat. Will never be back."}
{"text":"THE BEST! 30 years I've been eating this food, and it's still PERFECT!
I wish they stayed open later, but I'm willing to work around THEIR schedule!"}
{"text":"Pretty healthy fare for not much cash."}
{"text":"I have a fond place in my heart for this establishment

I've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ years

I've lived all over the world

I always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)
1.  Skim Milk
2.  Mexican food
3.  Tokyo Express

Now pay attention

If you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should order

An all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl
5 extra sides of spicy sauce
A small salad
2 extra sides of salad dressing

Ok, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.

This place makes me want to cry I love it so much."}
{"text":"I grabbed the indoor handrail as I climbed the 3 or 4 steps inside the restaurant, and immediately touched something gross, which I wiped off on my bluejeans. The first table I sat at was sticky. I moved to the next table over and didn't notice until I got up to leave that I had placed my phone in a big gloopy mess of something. My chicken bowl had two pieces of what was clearly beef in it. At this point, does it even matter what the food tasted like? There seems to be zero quality control here.

I only have one thing to say about the food. I ordered a \"moderately spicy\" Korean chicken dish whose name escapes me. It was not even a teensy bit spicy. I suspect I just got Teriyaki Chicken.

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Tokyo Express since I was teeny tiny.  My fam used to go a few times a week.  It's still the same and still as good.  I have tried alot of the items on the menu.  I like the regular terriyaki, the tokyo chicken, the sukiyaki, and the bentos.  The bento boxes are a ton of food for only about 7 or 8 bucks. I would definitely recommend this place for to-go japanese or a quick rice bowl lunch."}
{"text":"This is my hood, yo. I've been eating at TE since I can remember. Since before high school, I'm sure, but it is in high school that my most fond memories come from. After football practice, this was a must. 

I've always been a fan of the terriyaki chicken, double meat. Haven't strayed much from that, honestly. So... Maybe it's time to try something else. 

I've wanted to try the curry, but after going to Tokyo, and having curry there, I'm hesitant to try it. We'll see....

Thanks for the memories, Tokyo Express."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here since high school. Chicken Terryaki lite w/ brown rice is the business."}
{"text":"I had never been into this place before (because let's be honest, it looks a bit sketchy from the outside) but I am so glad my friend Melissa introduced me to it the other day on our lunch break! I had the Teriyaki Chicken combo and also had dumplings. All was good and I plan on going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Ordered a #11 and my girl ordered a #1. Mine tasted good but was a little meh... only rice, chicken, and carrots. Jazz it up a bit! Her teriyaki chicken was good but kinda soy-saucey tasting. Egg rolls were awesome though!   Overall not bad but nothing amazing. Place was clean but kinda outdated and could use sprucing up. Bathrooms were old and beat... toilet in the woman's was cracked lol. specially for Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since it opened in 1982, I must say the food has been going down hill since 2000. I went there today and ordered the beef curry and an egg roll -which I had to spit out and through away, it was discussing.  I'll have to try to find somewhere else to get my beef curry fix. Good luck Tokyo Express."}
{"text":"I would never visit this location again. The food was so bland and the girl working and manager are both very rude and dont understand the meaning of customer service. AT ALL. You want good food? Great customer service and a wider selection of sushi?? Go to the one off of Scottsdale Rd and Osborn in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The food is ok. I like the bento boxes but they're a little pricey for what you get. Just be prepared at lunch time for a wait. There were only two people in front of me but it took over 10 minutes to place my order and another 15 minutes to get my food."}
{"text":"I have no idea why there are so many good reviews here! My hibachi steak was like boiled grey leather with just mushrooms--no onions or zucchini like every other hibachi place I've ever eaten. I did get carrots but they were candied carrots eaten like dessert, not to be eaten with the meat. So weird. And gross. AND $1.25 for ginger sauce? Come on now."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time and I will be a regular. Their chicken salad is my favorite thing and their teriyaki chicken was delicious. Fast service and courteous."}
{"text":"3-1/2 Stars...  I was driving by the old neighborhood and had to swing by.  The chicken teriyaki bowl still taste the same from when I was a kid.  The chicken is grilled and perfectly seasoned withe the teriyaki sauce served over white rice.  I did not stay got the bowl togo, but they could update the place a little."}
{"text":"I could remember Tokyo Expresses were everywhere in the valley.  I loved their food.  I was surprise to see them around and excited to eat the food again.  We entered the place and it smelled like bleach.  STRONG.  It is ok.  We move to the menu and ordering area.  Everyone picked out their meal.  Ordered and sat down.  We got our food pretty quickly.  I got the Katsu Chicken meal (side sui may and drink).  The sauce in the Katsu was kinda of bland.  I remember the sauce was savory.  The sui may, I am sure was the pre-made frozen kind.  I was hungry so I ate it."}
{"text":"I only had 20 mins to grab dinner before I go to the comedy show, so Tokyo Express was close to M's house I run in.  Got my food in 10 min and inhaled my gyoza, terriyaki chicken, and my drink.  The sauce and chicken was ok.  It was a little warm inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I remember coming to Tokyo Express some 30 years ago and the consistency of the food is just as good now as it was back then. Nothing fancy. Just good inexpensive food.  It's unfortunate that there isn't one near my home."}
{"text":"We love Tokyo Express! Been going for years! The food is always fresh and well prepared. I get a large teriyaki bowl with double chicken after the gym for some good carbs and protein.  The sushi is nothing extravagant but tasty."}
{"text":"The hibachi chicken is fantastic! They serve it with the sweet carrots which are pretty hard to find. Delicious. Would recommend! Will return next time I'm headed to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Small place, seats about 30 ppl max. Have only had the hibachi steak but it is pretty darn good. I come here all the time for a good inexpensive meal. I guess I need to try some of their other meals pretty soon. It's never crowded when I come here usually about 4 to 5 people."}
{"text":"I love this place! When I used to live on that side of town,  I would go here all the time!!
The teriyaki chicken bowls are so tasty!
But the small side salad reigns supreme with me,  the dressing is a lemon ginger combo and oh so tasty!
So after 30 years of this awesome place, I have to go again when I am over that way!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this Tokyo Express is that when I see it from my car, I know I have almost arrived to El Molino, which is right around the corner. 

Oh, so back to the point, Tokyo Express is ok. I mean, I guess you have to be really trying to screw up a chicken teriyaki bowl, but the mere fact that they have the wherewithal to identify that as their specialty scores them some points so far as I'm concerned. 

As for the sushi, I haven't gone there, but I have a sneaking feeling that I don't want to. I haven't heard anything to support or contradict that sentiment, I'm just being honest. I feel like ordering sushi here would be the equivalent of ordering beef tar tare at McDonald's. They carry the ingredients, but I wouldn't recommend it. 

For a quick chicken teriyaki bowl and a soda for less than eight bucks, look no further."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Walked in and planned to have lunch here, but it reeked like bleach and sweat so bad that I left. Super outdated, junky, pot holes all over the parking lot, a really crappy area. The food looks really good in the pictures, but I don't trust it based on how the inside of this place looks."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Tokyo Express at the now closed location of 36th st and Thomas.  The food isn't exactly authentic but it was the first sushi I ever had and I still love their California rolls... I still haven't found anywhere that competes with their teriyaki chicken bowl."}
{"text":"Chicken special is the best!!! You get what you pay for. I have come here since I was a kid and every single time I come to this location they never dissapoint. Clearly the lower rated People had veeeeerrrryy bad luck."}
{"text":"Very small location, but food is always cooked fresh and is delicious.  I got the chicken--amazing--and my husband got the shrimp, which was better (he said) than even what he got recently on a trip to the beach. My family loves the carrots, but I don't eat cooked carrots, so that's hearsay. This is always a go-to when we're in the area. Delicious!"}
{"text":"So, I dated a Japanese guy in highschool. His parents owned a Japanese restaurant and I work there busing tables. I got hooked on the food. Tokyo Express has my favorite food on Earth. Well, almost. Their chicken katsu bowl is very close. Although its a bit funny because the real deal is made with pork, which is 'katsu' in Japanese, So their bowl is a 'chicken pork bowl'. LOL"}
{"text":"My dad raised me on Tokyo Express as a kid. Used to be a go-to spot and everything on the menu was awesome. The quality has gone down quite a bit in recent years. I used to order the ginger ahi tuna bowl almost every single time I went there, which they have taken off their menu. 
To get that old school Tokyo Express flavor, check out Eastwind at Tatum and Thunderbird, which used to be a Tokyo Express."}
{"text":"Maryvale Terrace Shopping Center, 4105 N 51st Ave # 151, Phoenix, AZ 85031

I checked three websites and I called twice -- to make sure -- I have the right restaurant and the right location of this chain of restaurants.

I double dog dare you to go there and eat a whole meal-- HORRIBLE!

I swear to God, I swear to everything that is holy to me this is the worst food I've ever had in my life. DOG FOOD. 

To put that into perspective, well, proper perspective, I have been made ill by restaurants and their food, and I dislike this dump more. 

The man stands back in the kitchen conducting business like he knows something - he doesn't know anything let alone tasting quality!

HEY! I've had three dishes in three visits and they all taste like dog food. The spicy Thai beef tasted like horribly-tasting spicy dog food meat. Oh, the orange hue on the beef is odd in and of itself. The curry is Dog Food Soup. What little flavor was there is quickly even buy the rice and you are just left for the plate full of mush. Dog food mush. 

I didn't have anything against these people until they served me horrid food for money. They don't know what the F their doing, they don't know what the F their serving, stay away from this dump,  
I beg of you!"}
{"text":"I called an hour before , my question was:\" what time do you close today?\" A young man answered: \"we will be here until 8:30pm . I drive over and they are CLOSED.  its 2:45pm. They just lost my business."}
{"text":"Not very good at all, I think it's time to close their doors! Food is horrible I have the tempura shrimp and it tasted like old oil, had a few other dishes and they were just as bad"}
{"text":"I've ate here twice. Both times I got a different bento box.

The food is not bad at all. Just keep your expectations in check. Pretend it's a Japanese fast food place inside a food court at the mall, and you'll know what to expect. 

I like it better than Kyoto bowl on 7th ave."}
{"text":"I used to live just a few blocks east on Camelback and would come here fairly frequently. 'Fast' Japanese was more unique back then, but Tokyo Express is still one of my favorite cheap eats every time we visit the Valley. I've always love the vibe this place gives off..."}
{"text":"Not impressed. When I ordered the Oyako bowl, the conversation went something like this: 
Me: What type of sauce comes on the Oyako bowl? 
Female employee: Chicken 
Me: Yes, I know it has chicken in it, but what type of sauce comes on the chicken and rice? 
Female employee: Chicken sauce 
Nico: Just order it Teresa 
Me: Ok, can you substitute noodles for rice, please? 
Female employee: Puzzled look of total confusion 
Me: Repeated the above question 
Female employee: Uhhh, no, no substitute for noodles 
Nico: This is not the time to be picky Teresa 
Me: Fine (as I'm looking at the sign that states \"Substitute noodles for rice for $0.80) 

Now I can see why the employee was so confused. There was NO sauce in my rice bowl. It was just chicken, rice, egg, and green onions. I had to add soy when we got home and I am not a huge fan of soy. Nico raves about this place and he very much enjoyed his Teriyaki rice bowl. I will go again and try something else, and I will probably make him order for me."}
{"text":"I am really shocked at all of the decent reviews for this place.  The only reason I am giving it one star is because the service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the Seafood Bento box and my husband got the chicken teriyaki and a beef bowl. 

Midway through, we discussed going through the Wendy's drive through.  It just seemed like the lowest quality of everything was used- gross rice, fish with a weird texture, even the chicken seemed of a lower quality then you get at the Asian food places in the mall.

Tokyo Express actually was recommended to us, unfortunately, we wish we would have stayed home and cooked.

I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tokyo Express for YEARS! About 24ish years to give you an idea. Everything is always as expected. I always order the teriyaki chicken with brown rice and a couple small salads and it always comes the exact same. Service is always pleasant. This particular location needs a remodel but it doesn't take away from the food at all.  I Love Tokyo Express!"}
{"text":"Best fast food Japanese in Arizona - period. Take a look at the locals, we've been going there for 20 years.
Tip - add on a small side salad for 25 cents"}
{"text":"Hibachi Chicken comes with fried rice carrots and mushrooms. The portion size was small especially since I added broccoli. The shrimp sauce was average. I would return in a pinch but would not be my first pick."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid. Their teriyaki and curry chicken bowls are my favorite. Also if you order their sushi they make it next door at the upscale sushi place that I'm sure is owned by the same people."}
{"text":"Good place for teriaki chicken and California rolls, fast service, pleasant environment. I have been coming here since the '80's."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: Tokyo Express was my first job (in 1994).  So I'm probably biased.  This is a Phoenix locals favorite.  The same people have been going here forever.

That being said --- I have tried boatloads of Japanese fast food in my life... and nothing comes close to 'the Tokyo.'  (anyone who EVER compares it to Shogun, etc.  Thems are fighting words.. and I'm a pacifist)

It's fast.  It's cheap.  I love that they place your announce your orders with \"ah-nay-guy-she-mas\" (which if I remember correctly, means 'please')

The sauce and rice are always perfect.  The salad dressing is out-of-this-world.  20 years I've been going there and I have no idea what's in it.  Probably an addictive chemical.  I don't care.  It is terrific.

I haven't worked in many restaurants but nobody cleaned a kitchen like the management at Tokyo Express.  You never have to worry about the back.  As a teenager I once ordered a sukiyaki bowl 27 shifts in a row... and I still wasn't sick of it by the end.

I only wish there were still more in town but if it's lunchtime and I pass by the one at 10th & Camelback or the one in old town Scottsdale.. Tokyo Express sucks me in like a tractor beam.

If I move away... upon returning, my first meal will be a spicy teriyaki chicken, a couple of side salads (with extra dressing) and a medium tropical iced tea.  That's not a meal.  That's utopia."}

Ninja stomach silent but hungry.

Order: Soba Noodles, Side Curry, Small Salad, Side Vegetables

Entree: Soba

Culinary Thought: I enjoyed this, all while applying a not-so known noisy ninja noodle-noshing technique .  Whilst consuming noodles, it is the only time for ninja to make sounds!  Also, it allows one to truly experience the essence of  soba.  Come with me sometime for a demonstration.  

Ninja Eating Plan: The season of winter was heavily upon the area at the time so it was appropriate.  I did negate the chicken provided, for this ninja is a vegetarian seeking the ultimate enlightenment. The gentle mix of gomashio (Japanese black and white salt granules) and shichimi (Japanese 7 spice pepper) nicely accompanied the broth but I do wish it was hotter due to my extensive ninja warrior training in the cold.  The noodles were the star of the dish, with the spinach playing a strong second shamisen.

Dessert: Chocolate Cake

Culinary Thought:  Normally ninja pass on dessert.  Tokyo Express is an exception to that ninja rule.  They KNOW dessert.


Gotten better since last time but I am eager to discover if it is even better now in 2013!  Happy New Year Tokyo Express!

P.S. I will return before the first blossoms of Spring after extensive ninja mountain training.  Itadakimasu!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE: this location has changed!!! I've loved many meals at Tokyo express until today. Many fond memories of delicious  calories was replaced by this unpleasant rice filled 'meal'.  Sadly, the food quality and flavor has left this location. I hope it's just this location and not the whole brand. 
Thinking back, I remember many meals at T.E. Thinking, 'I'm full. why can't I stop eating this delicious food?'. This is no longer a problem. It seems that most of my meal could easily be tossed aside. On the positive note, the line to order is much shorter. And another negative, the food take just as long as when the food was awesome. Why Toyko Express, Why?"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a huge food lover and me coming here starved and ordered the chicken katsu and tuna sushi rolls and I gotta say I didnt finish it. The chicken was too dry and not enough rice with it and the sauce that came with it was just bad as the chicken. The sushi had too much rice in its roll and just barely any fish meat on it. So i just tasted rice and sea weed on it. Will not recommend anybody here."}
{"text":"They recently remodeled and put in a new sushi bar at this place.  Some people are hesitant walking into a \"rice bowl\" place and ordering sushi.  I always was, until they added this bar.  It inspired me to try  their sushi.  I liked it.  

There is a combo that I always get.  Its a shrimp tempura roll (5 pieces), a spicy salmon (or tuna) roll (8 pieces), small side salad, cup of miso soup and I usually throw a drink on top of that.  I'm out the door stuffed for 10 bucks.  I have had this meal 3 times there in the past 3 weeks and I enjoy it every time.  Its absolutle the perfect place if you want to grab a quick bite of sushi on your own or don't feel like dealing with the sushi restaurant crowd."}
{"text":"Opted to try a noodle soup. Description did not include that shrimp was part of the soup. Sadly, not being able to eat shrimp, my entire to-go order was a waste. No happy belly on this trip."}
{"text":"McTokyo!! 
This was a fast food meal...Very bland, and boring 
Should have ate the noodles next door, or even a dominos pizza all in same strip mall 
This was the most worstess Asian food ever...

I will laugh as I pass this place by...you should too."}
{"text":"This place is rather old and a little run down, but huge!
I've never been in a Tokyo express this big. They even have a tree growing inside.
Great selection on the menu and prices are average.

I ordered the White meat chicken teriyaki bowl and a side of egg rolls. The chicken breast was dry and tasted more like turkey??? Egg rolls seemed like they most likely started out frozen, but then what do you expect for fast food.

Since its close to the office, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great stuff!  Food is good, drive thru is very convenient and, like it's cousin Eastwind, the sushi is pretty good too.  Definitely a diamond in the rough.  The Bento Boxes are absolutely the way to go.  Plus they serve Pepsi, and I like that better."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my mom. Walked in and it was empty and got to the counter and no one in the front. Someone saw us and took their sweet ass time to come help us. The food didn't seem fresh it was like they re heated up the meat and put it over old rice. Idk about this place anymore it use to be really good. Now the empty place speaks for itself. It's Losing it's flavor and touch"}
{"text":"Why did I agree to go here? BLAAAAAAH! Even for fast casual Japanese food, it sucked. I got the low-carb (no rice) teriyaki salmon bowl. The vegetables _ a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots _ had no flavor whatsoever. It was like hospital cafeteria veggies. Ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth? The sauce on the salmon was OK but once you eat off the top layer, no flavor inside at all. It was not worth $6.62 or whatever the price. I rarely go so far as to say \"Oh I could have cooked better at home\" but in this case, it's true. One of the worse meals I can remember having. And their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a) way too labor-intensive otherwise and b) that had more flavor. How can it be next door to Cherry Blossom Noodle? I need a good meal to counteract this."}
{"text":"The best Grilled Chicken/Rice Teryaki Sauce Combo in Scottsdale. Cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I'm craving this right now.  I want my Ahi Tuna with veggies and brown rice.  SO Freaking good.  Or maybe I'll splurge and get an Oyako with chicken egg and onion with that yummy sauce over brown rice, or is that the Katsu bowl?  I get the names confused but they are both good in case I order the wrong thing. 

While my friend is a huge fan of the Terriaki Lite bowl, I can honestly say I've never really had their terriaki bowl.  It's just not my thing, but I will say if you get the Terriaki Lite it's all white meat.  

My friend and I used to go there for lunch and get their combos, which while more expensive than burger fast food - are SO much better.  Rather than \"would you like fries with that\" you get like 6 different options including edemame (her choice), california rolls (My choice) and a side salad with ginger dressing.  And then your choice of drink includes green tea - my fav - with free refils of course.  During the lunch hour they are always playing classical music.  How cool is that?  

Final bonus - they have a drive through.  Healthy (ish) food on the go is awesome.  And what takes this from a 4 to a 5 stars for me.  

Well....that and I'm craving some right now."}
{"text":"Reached home with my order and it was the opposite of what I requested.  Called them and they simply told me that I ordered wrong.  I paid good money for something I could not eat.  Since when is chicken and a bowl full of white rice Teryaki Lite...  Ok, no time to go back - as they were not going to make it right anyway.  Tried to eat it... Chicken was dry as cardboard, and rice was a sticky mess.  Never again.

Save your money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often. Love the Karubi Spicy Chicken with noodles. Really appreciate the assistant manager, Lorena. She has great customer service and is very polite. Definitely recommend trying this place out for some authentic Japanese food. And make sure you leave Lorena a tip:)"}
{"text":"This place is progressively getting worse..... food amazing. Service is so terrible. The owners really need to step in."}
{"text":"I have been to Tokyo Express a couple of times.  I value authentic ethnic food, and this seems like an Americanized fast food joint.  I do have to say this is a step above a Panda Express.  I have tried the teriyaki chicken with white meat and sushi.  I will never get sushi here because it tasted like the fish was spoiled.  I asked for another serving, and they gave me something else for free instead.  The teriyaki chicken is pretty decent.  I think some of my friends have tried the eel, and they have seemed to enjoy it.

If you want quick Americanized Japanese food, this is a decent place."}
