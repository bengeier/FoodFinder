{"text":"The atmosphere is great it's not to big of a place but it's done up nicely and always warm and comforting. I have been going for about 15 years and the food is always good and consistent the odd time they make a mistake and they fix which I don't mind. What I have noticed recently is that the service has gone way down hill. From making a reservation to getting drinks and your food. As much as I like it the staff is making me not want to go anymore. If they could put better training into place I'm sure the place would do a lot better with customer happiness."}
{"text":"I have extremely mixed feelings about this place. I love the atmosphere, but I had a pasta dish once and it was disgusting, I couldn't even finish it. Recently I went back because I was craving good pizza and it was good. I'd go back to sit on the patio in the nice weather with a good pizza and glass of refreshing wine. The patio here does get the lovely afternoon sun as it is on the East side on Yonge street."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Italian restaurant serving up fabulous wood fired pizza and pasta dishes that are just wonderful. In addition, one of the best on tap European beer selections to wash all that Italian goodness down. We've been here three times and have never been disappointed. And all of this with prices that are more than reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This local Italian eatery is constantly packed along a street awash for places to eat Italian and it's our favourite.  Would highly recommend the Penne Porcini, a favourite of my better half who loves this place for the comfort pasta and their pizzas are delicious.  This is a great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Lovely cozy atmosphere with the smell of the woodfire oven. It's a favourite among locals in the area. Reasonably priced too.  You must try their gorgonzola gnocchi! Best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"We have been going to Piazzetta as a family for more than 15 years and they almost never miss. When they do, because it's busy, busy, the recovery makes you love them. It's our go to wood oven pizza and pasta comfort food neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"Just another Italian restaurant on Yonge between York Mills and Lawrence. We shared salmon pasta, romana pizza and bruscetta. They were alright. Though delicious I didn't think there were anything special about them. The pasta was salty, but it was expected as smoked salmon is naturally salty. We liked the pizza. It felt authentic. Bruscetta was ok.   I didn't like the ambiance as it was too casual. Service was good though. Our server was really friendly and always smiling. Restaurant was busy and it was difficult to carry on the conversation I was having with my friend."}
{"text":"Waited 70 minutes from when our order was taken to when our appetizers arrived. One appetizer never made it out at all, and this is with reservations. Food was ok but the terrible terrible service left a bad taste.  Never once did anyone come to the table to refill water or ask for re-fills.  Even when asked, the re-fills did not come.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"I felt like the service was mediocre, the pizza was very average to below average (with little toppings - you could see strands of mozzarella, a few sausages and it was very light on tomato sauce). The eggplant in tomato sauce was yummy but otherwise I didn't think this place was that impressive. We also had to ask for bread."}
{"text":"Our new fave little Italian spot! I had been driving by this restaurant on my way to work for almost 2 years and we finally went in last Saturday night and we were not disappointed!   It is the cutest spot (looks to seat about 30-40)... you do sit close to others but that didn't bother us because of the family vibe the restaurant gives off. The manager or owner was even putting on ladies coats as they were leaving their table! :)  And not to mention, the wood oven pizza was delicious! It came with all these different oils you could put on it too (see photo). Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is the worst.  You can save $$ here because you won't want to leave a tip.  And they don't care if you are pissed off. They load up on patrons with Groupons. If you have 2 hours for a dinner that should take 1 them try it. Otherwise go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been going to Piazzetta for years now,  and if you enjoy authentic Italian this is the place for you!  The seafood appetizer platter is my favorite,  and the selection of pasta and pizza are excellent!  Wine selection is great and complements the menu perfectly.  Owner here is awsome and makes you feel welcome and special. Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend and it really reminded me of a small family run restaurant in Italy (only the wine was slightly more expensive as it always is here!).  To start we had the Carpaccio and it was very well done, very fresh and thinly cut with large thin slices of parmesan accompanying it.  After that I had the veal parmesan and she had a pizza. The veal parmesan was huge and came with pasta on the side so I had no regrets. My friends Pizza was also great. They have a large pizza oven in the back which you can see from almost anywhere in the restaurant so it adds to the authenticity.  One thing which I loved more than anything was that it had 4 different types of Paulaner beer and the Paulaneer Lager is my favorite beer on the planet and hard to find in Canada. They're not an italian beer so I'm not sure why they were serving them, but they obviously have good taste!"}
{"text":"Note: this review is of the location at 936 Eglinton Ave. West.   This was my 2nd time visiting Piazzetta Trattoria. The first time was over a year ago for a friend's birthday party and we were sitting at a large table in the middle of the restaurant. My lingering memory of that occassion was the noise level. It was one of those Saturday nights where the restaurant was packed and you had to yell if you wanted to communicate with someone not sitting directly beside you.    So, when I recently purchased a Groupon (spend $25 get $55) for the restaurant, I did so with the hopes that maybe it wouldn't be as loud this time around. Fortunately, I was seated in a corner of the restaurant at a small table and as a result seemed to be a little easier on the ears.  For my meal, I chose the soup of the day (French Onion ($7) - yes, I know, who orders French Onion Soup in an Italian restaurant? ;-)). For my main, I chose a pizza with chicken and diced tomato ($15) (the exact name of the pizza is escaping me at the moment). For dessert I chose the Tiramisu ($7).  The soup was ok. Not bad. Not outstanding. Simply acceptable. It was not served in a typical French Onion soup bowl. Portion size was generous and there was a healthy amount of onions. Only thing that I would have done differently would be to dial down the salt. I needed to drink a half glass of water just to quench my thirst. Next time I'd probably try something more Italian like Minestrone.  Again, the pizza was ok. Not the best I've ever had, but not horrible either. It was a typical Italian fine dining restaurant type of pizza. It was thin crust, however it was also soft/chewy. They were not overly generous with the toppings, but it was just enough to get by. The sauce was tasty, and could have used just a bit more cheese.   The tiramisu was tasty, however, I found it to be a bit soggy. Further, by this point, I was quite stuffed, which impacted my enjoyment of the dessert. I chose to take a doggy bag for the dessert, and a few days later, it was quite taste when consumed on an empty stomach.   My friend ordered the gnocchi for his main and the chocolate mouse cake for dessert. No complaints were uttered, so I am going to assume that it was good.  The service was quite attentive. I was greeted immediately upon entry to the restaurant and we did not have to wait long for our server to arrive or for the meal to arrive from the kitchen.   I would rate my experience as a solid four stars and would recommend Piazza Trattoria to others looking for an Italian meal in the Eglinton West area."}
{"text":"This used to be a really great spot for a simple pasta dish or oven pizza, particularly if you live around the valley.  Easy in and out.  Unfortunately when ownership changed some years back (and it has been a while at this stage) the quality dropped off."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! But the food was.. meh... Me and my boyfriend got the antipasto piazzetta to share, it was small considering it says it was for 2 people, the calamari was kinda burnt and the cheese was really hard. The zuchinni and eggplant were delicious though. We got the Ossobuco and veal chop. They were pretty decent. Got the cherry cheesecake for the dessert, not really a big fan. Overall the main was good and the service was excellent. Would go back again."}
{"text":"We went for a nice diner with friends today. The service was excellent (thank you Albi) the Pizzas delicious and the desserts a dream!"}
{"text":"From Yonge & Finch to Yonge & Lawrence, this is certainly one of the better Italian restaurants to go to. I've probably been here at least five times.  One of the draws is their woodfire oven that is used for their pizzas and baked pastas.  Although not my absolute favourite Italian restaurant, I've never been disappointed.  The prices for the pasta mains are in the $15 range but they are very generous in their portion so I guess you get some good value there.  The place is consistently busy, especially on Saturday evenings so a reservation is highly recommended... especially close to the pizza oven during the winter. If you can get a seat there, you'll definitely enjoy a comfortable dinner."}
{"text":"Nice cozy spot with some great pizzas! Had a beef salad which I wasn't crazy about but the pizzas are worth going back for."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I will definitely come back. they have a great selection of wine and the food comes in great portions and prices are affordable"}
{"text":"Loved the place run by dad and sons.  Ciao Italia For sure.  The gnocchi was the best ever - had it with tomato and bocconcini!  Pizzas were great!  I chose the house wine which was full bodied and perfect.  My husband loved his Italian pilsner.  Will def go back.  Must book over weekends."}
{"text":"Last summer, I taught at a school (yay for summer school) at Yonge & Steeles so my route would be to go along Yonge Street. Something about the store front stood out to me and I quickly took notice of this place. A year later I have finally dined at Piazzetta.   My friend and I made a reservation for seven o'clock. When we first arrived, I thought that the making of a reso was completely unnecessary and I felt a little stupid ... however, within a half hour, this place became packed and I no longer felt like a drama queen for saving ourselves a spot.   The resto is quite small and will seat no more than 45 people. There is also a party room on the second floor. I liked the ambiance and decor of the place. You can see the pizza being made in Piazzetta's wooden oven. Italian ez-rock is played in the background. For the summer, you can sit outside on Yonge.   It's a very 'kid friendly' place I noticed. In fact, I'm thinking I should have rented a kid for the night as the friend and I were the only non-parents. There's a children's menu, which would be a bonus if I was a mother ... I think anyway.   Service was pretty good. The food came quickly and our server always came by to fill our water glasses.   Now for the most important part of a review ... THE FOOD  I thought the pizza was pretty good! The prices here are quite reasonable considering portions are h u g e . If you do order a pizza, I would suggest sharing with someone as it was hard to finish an entire one on my own. Our neighbours ordered pastas - lasagna and spaghetti. It smelled delicious and these people seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their meals. Once again, portions are huge so you can def share a pasta dish.   Yay, I'm a fan.  We have a 4 star here ~"}
{"text":"We ordered a cheese-stuffed mushroom appetizer, sausage pasta, a chicken dish, and an ice cream desert. The entrees were good, but I'd consider the other dishes decent/fair.  Service was extremely slow. It took 40 minutes before our food orders were taken, and the restaurant was only half-full. The table behind us were also wondering aloud where their server disappeared to (they were waiting half an hour for their bill). We waited half an hour after our entrees were finished before our server came back.  I was also informed that Osso Buco was excluded from our Groupon, but there was no mention of this anywhere (even in the list of exclusions on the Groupon).  Decent food, good price, slow service. Beware of unlisted exclusions if you're using a Groupon."}
{"text":"My second visit wasn't quite as enjoyable as the first. We went with children later than intended on a Saturday evening, and it was quite busy. We were asked if we had reservations, which we didn't, but we were seated right away anyways. We were seated in front of the door, which made for an uncomfortably cold experience.  Our table's appetizer and the children's pizza came at the same time -- a big pet peeve of mine. The appetizer was not very appetizing; the grilled vegetables were cold and mushy and nearly made me gag, but perhaps this is how it's meant to be served. I won't be ordering it again.  A long 20 minutes later, our pasta arrived... but only one dish. I asked the server if the other dish was coming. For some reason, she assumed I had ordered one dish for my girlfriend and I to share. We had both ordered the same dish, and I figure because the restaurant was so loud, the server misinterpreted my hand gesture as me saying we were going to share one dish. She offered to have another one made, but service had already taken much too long, so we just shared the dish.  The food was still very good, although the appetizer was not really to anyone's liking.  The pizza was a bit too thin and floppy and very difficult to handle for an adult, let alone a child.  Service was extremely slow on this busy night, and the restaurant was very loud.  I'll probably come back some day, but perhaps on a less cold, less busy night.  And I'll probably go straight to the main course."}
{"text":"I went with a friend a few weeks back when I was carb loading for the Scotia Half.  The place wasn't busy so we were giving choice seating selection, and lots of attention from the staff. I ordered the PAGLIA EN FIENO AL PORCINI. My dish was delicous! I would certainly go again for the same dish.  The only downside to my visit was the cold coming in from the door which we were sitting near.   I would go again and invite new friends to come and discover this little gem!"}
{"text":"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. I ordered $62.78 for delivery from Piazzetta Trattoria via a food service. After 45 minutes, the delivery service called and apologized because Piazzetta never entered the order. They were at the restaurant and would wait until the order was made. Then the driver had to call again and say Piazzetta would not fulfill the order because now they were to busy. The order was for my children who waited over an hour only to be told that they would not be getting their dinner until I could either make something quickly or call another delivery."}
{"text":"This is our second time at Piazetta with a voucher and decided to buy another one since we had a pleasant experience the first time at their EGLINTON location. The second voucher could only be used at this location so this review will be for this specific location.   We made a reservation for 6pm but there was only 1 other table besides us which was unusual for a dinner time at a typical restaurant.  When were ordering, most of the dishes on the menu wasn't available without any explanation. We ended up choosing just whatever from our limited choice.   Our appetizer, Calamari Fritta, took 30 minutes to arrive.  We ordered this at the other location expecting it to be equally delicious.  Wrong. There was barely no breading, it was dried and hard, and the veggies used for presentation were not fresh.   The Entrées finally came out after waiting over an hour. My boyfriend's dish which clearly stated 3 tender sirloin on the menu only got 1. The waiter told us it was a 'big' piece that's why he only got one as they go by \"weight\".  My Veal Parmigiana was very small and thin, and the side pasta was over-flowing with sauce.   During our 2 hr+ dinner(service was ridiculously slow), 4-5 different groups of people came by knocking on the door and on our window trying to get into the restaurant. We realized the door had been locked. The waiter was busy going back and forth from kitchen to the tables, and was ignoring these people waiting outside. Finally when the sound of the knocking was becoming loud and aggressive, the waiter went out to talk to them. From what we heard, apparently the cook was sick so they had to close the restaurant and only let in few parties that they were capable of serving due to limited staff.  Unfortunately, we were one of them... so for all this time, this \"waiter\" guy was cooking and serving at the same time. That explained the tardiness of the service, limitation on the menu, and poor quality and presentation of the food. Eventually the waiter told us that although the cook was sick, he knows how to cook and told us not to worry. Obviously we were very worried because he was not the chef but a guy that works at the bar and cashier.   The waiter did not apologize, and complained to us that the vouchers were not worth it for them since they're \"losing money\".  We should have walked out when our appetizer came out, but because our voucher was expiring soon we decided to stay. I will NOT return to this location, and it is truly the worst restaurant experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm a pasta fan! Actually I make my own pasta from the scratch and I have to say if  If you want to eat the second best pasta in the city you have to eat here! ( The first one is my pasta lol) The environment is amazing! And the staff is very friendly. And the food of course is amazing!... Definitely I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"I had high hopes with the good reviews. Servers were completely understaffed, the door was open so there was a draft and it was cold at certain tables. We didn't get water until we placed our orders, we had to ask for bread (bread didn't taste that good and the olives were wierd tasted like raisins).. and the pizza (siciliano) dough tasted undercooked and not crispy enough. The mozzarella cheese was scarce on the pizza and  the toppings weren't as flavorful as it could have been. Whole wheat pappardelle was cooked ok but the chicken was a bit on the dry side and again flavors were lacking in the dish in general. Eggplant parmigiano was good though!  Noone came to ask us how the food was."}
{"text":"2.5 star  I have been to Piazzetta Trattoria twice, I guess it is time for me to write a review.  The dinner room is quite small, so make sure you make a reservation if you want to dine here on Saturdays.  I have sampled the following items:  Caesar Salad ($8)  Veal Scaloppine Limone ($20) - one of the worse veal I ate, rubbery and chewy  Spaghetti Bolognese ($15) - Great meat sauce and the pasta was cooked al dente  Linguini Pescatore ($16) - Tons of Seafood and the tomato sauce is light, good value at this price point!  Pizza Affumicata ($15) - though it supposed to be a thin crust pizza, it tasted soft and doughy  Services were so so! One of the waitress reminded me not once, but twice that I need to tip the amount before the voucher and in a really condescending tone that I found offensive! And that's even before we started ordering!"}
