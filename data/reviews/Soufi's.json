{"text":"Everything I've had here has been delicious. Came twice on my own and on my third round brought a number of colleagues -- all of them loved it."}
{"text":"Super delicious flat bread pizza (Manasseh) that you can also request in whole wheat. I have the red pepper paste with cheese version and it was so good! I also tried the dessert. Reminded me of a cheesy and soft version of baklava. Super friendly service and they serve legit cappuccinos! Also very affordable. Perfect for a mid week lunch or casual dinner. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Authentic tastes of the Middle East in the heart of Toronto! Delicious Manaeesh and Kunafe! Recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe here. Had their mhammara Manaeesh (flatbread) and it was delicious! The music, art and decor are beautiful artifacts from Syria and excellent service :) hoping this place continues to do well and bring in more patreons"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese manaeesh and also the sujuk with cheese. The cheese manaeesh was great,  the cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was nice and toasty and a great size, it went perfect with my coffee. I also tried the sujuk with cheese and OMG the flavours were amazing!! I was full but I wanted to keep eating it just for the flavour of the wonderful spices used. It was the perfect late breakfast. I went in on a Saturday around 12:30, it took a little less then 10 minutes and it wasn't busy but had some movement. I would definitely recommend this place and will be back because I just love it! What a great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, highly recommended, and very good service. You should try the spice beef manaeesh"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and delicious. My first time trying Manaeesh and I love it. Friendly staff and just a lovely, clean place to have a quite bite."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The staff are always smiling and the whole place has a nice happy vibe."}
{"text":"The knaffeh is incredible, better than Paramount and Adonis. I haven't tried the manaeesh, but after seeing their oven and housemade flatbreads I'll definitely be going back to try it."}
{"text":"A hot flatbread stuffed with cheese and other things? It's the snack I never knew I needed in my life."}
{"text":"Feels like you're waking into a grandmother's kitchen. The food is well made and quite flavorful and delicious and dare I say you can taste the love? Bring a friend, have a bite and take a load off. The music, the atmosphere and the food will have you leaving with a smile on your face and a note to self to come back next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for Manasseh and coffee... great staff cute comfy spot. Knaffeh is amazing too. Def try it if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Incredible food! I had spinach manaeesh with labneh and shredded knaffeh. Folks who work there were really welcoming and the small space is lovely and casual. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything at Soufi's was amazing. The hummus was delish, so many of the manaeesh's were great. My personal favourite was the spiced beef with cheese...it's so good. The cheese knaffeh was also just amazing!   Aside from that, it's a family owned business and they are the sweetest and kindest. Would def def def recommend this place..affordable and tasty!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but was unfortunately very disappointed! I ordered the labneh Manasseh, which was supposed to consist of yogurt, mint, and vegetables on a pita bread. When I was ordering, the lady told me it would have vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers stuffed in it. What I received however had absolutely nothing except a thin layer of yogurt and olives! When I brought my concern up with the staff, they took my half eaten dish to the back, opened it up, and stuffed it with 2 slices of tomato. At the very least, they could've made me a new one with the ingredients that I was promised! Very unprofessional service - will not be returning.   If you're looking for overpriced and underdressed pita bread, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I don't find them too filling - can easily do 2 if a bit hungry, 3 if hungry, 4 if really hungry, and 5 if starving.  My favs are the pizza, the cheese, and the beef.  Absolutely worth a try."}
{"text":"The food was meh and the vibe was pretty off. Staff doesn't seem happy or excited about the place. I was met with no eye contact or any explanation of what to do to order. Staff looked really unhappy to be there.  I was really excited about this place     The bread is really good, the fillings are meager and really dry.  Hope they can tweak these things to improve. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was here with the fam Sunday for lunch. FAB! We shared & tasted a few flatbreads - ALL tasty. Liked the Red Pepper & Avocado (tangy!), but the Spiced Beef/Provolone was primo! What nutmeg! Mmm-mm! Luckily nearby fro-yo cooled my tongue afterward, but I'd DEFINITELY go back to Soufi's! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Friendly, welcoming staff with an array of new tastes and  flavours to discover. We ordered one every Manasseh they had on the menu. Wasn't the best I ever had, but good value for price. Our favourites were the sujuk, haloumi and zataar. The pita bread was made to order, so be prepared to wait a bit.   Don't forget to try their homemade knafeh desserts, they were wonderful, not too sweet and interesting textures.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soufi's is a small, intimate cafe that exudes warmth from the moment you step in. Be it the beaming smiles of staff that greet you or the decor on the walls / quotes written on the napkin boxes resting on tables, you feel welcomed and excited to try what they have to offer.  The menu offers a variety of Manaaeesh (flat breads) and Knaffeh (a sweet seal to the flavourful savoury meal).  This was my first time. I ordered 2 Manaaesh   (Zaatar and Sujuk) and a Knaffee. One bite into the Zaatar Manaeesh I experienced a burst of flavours with the labneh, tomato, cucumber and mint it was topped with. It was delicious and so refreshing! Sujuk, a minced meat Manaeesh, was recommended by my friend who grew up in the Middle East. Admittedly, I was most skeptical about this one because I'm not a fan of minced meat on my pizza or Manaeesh. With a quarter of my Zaatar left, I decided to work on this in case I didn't like it and could use the pleasant Zaatar as my last bite. But was I surprised! The meat was very flavourful - an absolute delight. The last one I had was the spinach /lemon / walnut. I was a little underwhelmed because on paper it sounded very good.  The star of the meal was warm knaffee. Sweetened with honey, this is a must have!  Recco: Knaffee, Sujuk & Zaatar Manaeesh."}
{"text":"Love the food here - specifically the Banoffeh (banana caramel knaffeh) and the spinach man'ousheh! Cozy place and great atmosphere, love the Arabic music they play!"}
{"text":"The knaffeh... OH MY GOD. Ask for it warmed up, that's when the flavor really shines. The cheese gets gooey, the syrup makes the whole pastry melt in your mouth... That first bite is pure heaven. I come here mainly for the knaffeh. I've tried the manakeesh and they're good, nothing out of the ordinary but the knaffeh... If you eat there and don't order it, you are so missing out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quick meal or a big snack this is the place to stop to have one! Manakeesh taste just like the real one we have back home I do not know what to tell you about the smell. I ordered one mankooshe half zaatar half muhamarah felt like dreaming with every bite! Banofah is a MUST!! If you don't like it too sweet ask them to put the syrup before heating!! Whenever I am back to TO I will definitely visit this restaurant again!!!"}
{"text":"We happened to be walking on Queen West when we decided to have some snacks. Soufi's exterior decor looked interesting and we decided to give it a go. We both ordered Turkish coffee and Knaffeh. There is also an assortment of Manakeesh but we did not try them. The open concept sitting arrangement at storefront is great for people watching while you enjoy your meal.  I will give it a solid 3 star. Service was prompt, but the food is average. It is a decent place to sit down and grab a snack."}
{"text":"Sujuk was perfectly spiced. The bread was crisp, warm and fresh from the wood oven. I've tried this dish in the past elsewhere and I like that Soufi's Sujuk is not runny and that weight ratio between the spicy ground beef and the flat bread is well balanced. The tabouleh is also incredible. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with syrian cuisine. I had a wonderful time here. I tried a syrian version of a savory crepe called Manaeesh. It was light and tasty and perfect for a breakfast snack. The service is friendly. I had a lovely conversation with the owner about the food and the music from the region. She helped me identify the music of Abdel Halem Hafez that was playing at the time. Overall a great experience and I will go back again. I must add that being a vegetarian, i found many options to choose from."}
{"text":"Cozy little space, SO delicious, and the owner and staff are super welcoming and sweet. You can tell they are passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"Soufi's is a Syrian restaurant specializing in flat bread sandwiches (Manasseh) served with a variety of meats/toppings, as well as a pastry with orange blossom honey syrup (Knaffeh)  The flat bread (about the size of a small/personal pizza folded in half) is served fresh and hot with the toppings on the inside.  It tastes quite good, yet likely needs a side (tabbouleh-also available) to make it a full meal.  Definitely worth trying. My flat bread sandwich with beef and cheese, along with a can of Pepsi was $11."}
{"text":"This place will become a Toronto institution!  I will definitely want to try each and every item on the menu (more than once)...It's an absolutely must do!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! Music and service were amazing. I really enjoyed the Knaffeh! Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"My favourite mana'ish place in the city!! In a very convenient location on Queen and Bathurst. Their food is authentic and tasty. They have amazing vegan options too. Highly recommend the muhammara with avocados"}
{"text":"Food was good (we got 2 Manaeeshs) but the service here is a way way too slow. We ordered two things and waited over 25 minutes. When we arrived the place was empty so there is really no excuse. They also forgot to bring us tap water."}
{"text":"My daughter and her boyfriend were in town and after reading the New York Times article on Soufis, I wanted to take them there to try it as we are Lebanese and appreciate great Mideast food. The environment is more cafeteria style. There's only room for maybe 10 people in there. But that's fine, as long as the food is worth it. I asked the woman behind the counter if the eggplant flatbread Manaeesh was big enough for a meal and she said yes. All three of us ordered one each (different types), but when we got them, my eyes nearly fell out of my head - it was barely enough for an appetizer. Three of them cost about $24. We were so hungry after that we ordered the dessert, which was good but certainly, again, not worth the 18 extra dollars. The food was good - not amazing. On top of it, later when we went home and said to each other what a ripoff the price of the food was, we discovered that using Yelp, we could have gotten free coffee. Of course no one in the restaurant told us that. Overall, I am all about supporting newcomers to Canada, but if I'm ripped off, I don't care where you're from."}
{"text":"I had the zaatar and my partner had the spiced beef, both great tasting and they came out of the kitchen quickly. We had been here before to have the banana caramel dessert which was also delicious. Great addition to Queen Street West!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a higher end coffee shop.  If you are interested to be full, I would suggest getting two Manaeesh, one will be enough for a smaller lunch or a bigger snack.  I got Sfeeha - ground beef with spices and veggies and cheese.  It was very tasty, and a great blend of spices.  I would recommend it.  It was $7.25 before tax.  The place is a coffee shop, where you order the food at the counter, pay for it and pick it up from there.  There are a few seats for those who want to dine in, but not great for groups."}
{"text":"When in doubt, I make my way to Soufi's! It takes me waaaaay too long to decide where I want to grab a bite, but that's changed since Soufi's has opened. I'm definitely a Manaeesh enthusiast and have tried almost all of their vegetarian options. My favorite will always be the egg and cheese with avocado. My taste buds are also huge fans of the Mhammara with cheese.  The vegan knaffeh is deliiiiiiish and I love knowing that the cashew cheese in it is made in house.  So if you're looking to take your senses on an affordable trip to the Middle East, Soufi's will do."}
{"text":"Finally a proper manaeesh place! My friends and I tried four flavors. Super light and tasty. Their knafeh is also delicious."}
{"text":"Really nice cafe!  Their Knaffeh is delicious! The cafe is very busy so it is hard to find a seat and you might have to wait. This can be hard because some people could spend hours there. However, a great place for take out. I really hope this cafe does well."}
{"text":"The flat breads were delicious and very fairly priced. The tabouleh salad was great. The service was really good and super friendly staff. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Bonoffeh (banana caramel) Knaffeh @ $4.75 is pretty tasty with espresso at $3.75 total for two items was $11.00 something ... This Syrian Dessert was off the hook the music in the background was loud and Arabic and the outside company of a Rottweiler was just an icing on the cake.. Great addition to the neighbourhood!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I checked out this new queen street gem and enjoyed it. It was quite authentic with s few tweaks for the North American market. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I picked up a Manakeesh, Zaatar flavour. Really tasty! Nice people too."}
{"text":"I had never tried Syrian food, so while visiting Toronto, when I heard about a little Syrian restaurant recently featured in the New York Times, I obviously had to stop in. And so should you. Here's why:  1. Manaeesh - flatbreads (perfectly chewy), topped with SO many things. Examples:  cheese, thyme, sesame seeds, olives, spinach, pomegranate molasses, walnuts, eggplant, beef, mint. Choose from one of the recommended options, or create your own. (I got the Mhammara - spicy red pepper and tomato paste - yes yes yes). 2. Knafeh - delicately flavored filling (either cheese, cashew cheese, or caramel-banana-tahini), topped with phyllo and drizzled with orange blossom syrup. Gah so good. 3. Plenty of vegan options, as well as whole wheat flatbread. 4. Cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable staff, which is excellent when you're choosing from a menu of options you have never heard of and cannot pronounce.  I can see why Soufi's was featured in the New York Times; if I had a newspaper, it's pretty much all I would write about."}
{"text":"A place where you can enjoy good food, Middle Eastern baked Manakeesh fresh from the oven that taste great. You end up eating one more and then finish it with Kenafa the heaven of sweets"}
{"text":"I heard many good things about this place and I followed them on Instagram and been wanting to try it for a long time and now I did.  It is a great place to hang out with family amd friends, people are very friendly, music is awesome and reminded me of back home. Food, is so delicious, I tried their Zaatar and labneh manousheh, sujok, halumi cheese and spinach yes I did eat too much all where amazing, the spinach one was so so needed more spices. Then for desert I had Knafeh, and then first bite took me directly to my home country. I loved this place and will go again there.  Their tea with mint is good too"}
{"text":"I think Soufi's is off to a great start. They're really trying to deliver a welcoming experience and food that is truly delicious.  I visited them for three reasons:  1) We were starving and across the street 2) We had guests (6 including myself)  and 1 of my guest preferred to eat Kosher. 3) I had high expectations because it's Syrian food!  Overall, the food was great but you need to know what to order so here is a pro tip:  Try the Spicy Beef Manaeesh but you have to ask for their homemade hot sauce which is delicious (the kitchen is pretty accommodating). The on the shelf hot sauce at their cutlery station is Tabasco. They should probably sell the homemade hot sauce for an additional charge because it's worth paying for and it should definitely be an option. It's not listed on the menu or I may be wrong here but I certainly didn't see it. The Spicy Beef wasn't spicy at all but it was delicious and had ample flavour.  Off topic:  I don't think Tabasco should be allowed in any restaurant. It destroys the flavour and masks it with vinegar. Not fair to the kitchen. It's cool if you're having oysters though. Then you better have Tabasco.  Back to what I was saying:   We ordered olives but the olives never came. I realized this a day after visiting the restaurant and I feel that they're new so they are still figuring things out. No hard feelings. They're just olives.   The hummus is stored in the fridge where the drinks are and it's pretty cold. I recommend keeping it out for 30 minutes before eating it but I don't know if anyone would want to wait thirty minutes before eating their hummus. Hummus needs to be at a certain temperature so when you dip the pita, the pita should just scoop it up. There was a fight between my pita and hummus.  The coffee was really good. We all enjoyed our coffee's.  Some of the staff were working the front and in the kitchen as well. That's not fair and certainly would be overwhelming for anyone.  It's an excellent place to have a snack. I don't think the Manaeesh menu is a solid lunch or dinner space. I recommend ordering 1.5 Manaeesh per person. 1 Isn't enough  I think they have a lot of potential and will most certainly visit the space in the month of September and I intend on updating my review during that time."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch at this tasty Syrian spot a few weeks ago. They specialize in manaeesh flatbread.  We tried several manaeesh, including halloumi, and akawi cheese. The best was the Sujuk, which had spiced ground beef inside. We also enjoyed a knaffeh, melted cheese with shredded phyllo soaked in syrup. A cross between lunch and dessert that was really good. We should have ordered two; the kids went crazy for it.  I could have used a little more flavour punch, but that's a quibble, especially since the price is so low. Definitely a strong option for a quick bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY!?  The Turkish coffee (very strong!). You only get a small espresso cup size of that coffee too. The Manaeesh is their famous flatbread to try at this restaurant. Comes with different toppings/spreads that is inside the flatbread.   Perfect for a snack, breakfast, dinner or lunch, you can get it with cheese, meat or veggies. I personally think if you're a big eater, you'll need two flatbreads to fill you up. I think the Manaeesh is definitely a great snack option though.   The flatbreads are made to order and they have a big oven in the back to make it. I ordered the cheese and meat option and the eggplant option. Both taste distinctly from each other, and I really like the moist inside yet crunchy outside of the flatbreads. For a more satisfying experience of the Manaeesh, I suggest adding additional toppings to make it a fuller meal.   The flatbreads are part of the Syrian cuisine, so it's definitely worth a try. I suggest coming in if you're looking for a snack mid afternoon to see if you like it.   LAST TIP?!  There's a mix of vegetarian and meat options however there is only beef or egg option for meats. I suggest sharing two or three of the different Manaeeshs so you can try a few flavors."}
{"text":"This place serves incredible, fresh and delicious food. I highly recommend! Favourites so far? Sujuk! Haloumi! And the Cashew knafeh!"}
{"text":"Love that they have lactose free/vegan options. I tried the Cashew Cheese Knaffeh, which came with a little side of extra orange blossom syrup. The knaffeh is super sweet, so if you have a sweet tooth craving then this would be a good choice.   It takes about 10 minutes to bake/warmup the dessert, which I didn't anticipate as I thought you could just grab and go, so be aware of that!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Soufi's for lunch on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised by the service and delicious Syrian manaeesh! I ordered a sujuk (spiced beef) and added cucumber as well as cheese (at the recommendation of the staff). The wait for the manaeesh was around 3-5 minutes and was piping hot when it came out of the oven. The flavours of the beef, cheese, and cucumber paired well together (was quite cheesy!).  Staff were friendly and the eatery had a welcoming and warm atmosphere. Will definitely come back to try more!"}
