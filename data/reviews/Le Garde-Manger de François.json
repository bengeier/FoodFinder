{"text":"Les croissants: un pur délice quant au capucino il est imbattable. Je recommande aussi le pain de mie,la baguette etc.En bref aucun article qui ne soit pas à la hauteur de ce qui se fait de mieux et le personnel est d'une grande courtoisie. Ne manque que le pain carré traditionnel et la perfection est atteinte."}
{"text":"The best croissants and waffles on the South Shore!  You can sit outside on the small porch or inside and have a coffee and a pastry.  The inside is not decorated and very bland in decor but the pastries are lovely!  Try the nut bread as well."}
{"text":"Place agréable pour une petite bouchée dans la journée ou simplement un café. Personnel toujours accueillant. Cote boutique de beau produit dont le pain baguette  bio ou encore le \" poêlant \" lui aussi bio"}
{"text":"A hidden heavenly place. Lot's of pastry varieties are available. Coffee is great. Various types of breads. Desserts (especially for apple based ones) and of course typical French croissant.. Very pleased to be here."}
{"text":"There's a way to know when you're legit.  It's not when everyone else wants to copy you.  It's not when everyone else hates you.  It's when they want to make money off of you, and Le Garde-Manger de Francois (please pardon my lack of diacritical marks, it is solely due to my laziness and lack of 10-key numeric keypad for ANSI codes) is legit because the stuff they make is for sale elsewhere.  As in an IGA elsewhere in Chambly en route to the Montregie cider route.    When IGA bakes their own bread, but sells Francois' bread right next to it, you're legit.   Don't believe me.  Go to Chambly.  If you're a local, you are blessed with a wonderful small-town-feel place to spend a day.  The fort and canal are beautiful, the parks are plentiful, there are a handful of ice cream stands.  Get a picnic lunch at Le Garde-Manger de Francois.  Have them press the sandwiches.  Take them nearby, or all the way to Michel Jodoin cidery, where picnic tables overlook an absolutely dramatic view of the Rougemont apple orchards.  Buy a bottle of cider (bring your own glasses), let them open it, and enjoy.    Don't want to take-out?  There's a nice porch, or tables inside.    The bread is of course fresh, and the ciabattas are perfectly done.  The crust is solid, just enough bite, and the dough is resilient without being harsh.  It is so wonderful.  Their duck breast sandwich is so simple, but so delicious.    Two sandwiches and around 200g of a salad - in this case, homemade yellow beet salad, sweet as candy - ran us around CA$21.  This is what you'd freaking pay at Panera.    If Trump gets elected I'm emigrating to Chambly solely because that's where Garde-Manger Francois is located."}
