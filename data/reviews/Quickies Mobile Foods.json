{"text":"Great from scratch kitchen Mobile Food Truck! The owners Noah and Heidi are so friendly and extremely passionate about the food they are serving which is awesome to see! I would highly recommend this truck to anyone at any event."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this awesome food truck! We got a burrito bowl and it was super tasty. The breakfast sausage inside was OMG good. All of the ingredients were so fresh. The best part about the experience was the service. We were at The Wander Tortoise in Arcadia where the food truck was parked on a Sunday and we were waiting on one of our friends to arrive. We knew they were leaving soon and didn't want our friend to miss out on the food but had no clue what to order him, so we waiting. After a couple of beers we forgot about our friend's hunger, but Quickies did not! They came inside and found us to let us know they'd be shutting down shortly so it gave us time to put an order in for him. They whipped something amazing up for him as well and was on their way. Couldn't ask for a better food truck experience. Go Quickies!!"}
