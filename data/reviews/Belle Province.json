{"text":"The poutine here wasn't that great. For 6$, you get a relatively small sized serving (which is good I guess, if you're worried about the numbers on the scale). The cheese was definitely 'squeaky', but the fries tasted like they were in the fryer too long (i.e. they tasted burnt) and the gravy was nothing to write home about. But being in a state of inebriation, I still ate the entire thing. Such is life.

Considering Frites Alors is just down the street, I recommend going there instead."}
{"text":"I was hung over, starving and looking for a greasy food fix on St. Laurent one afternoon when my friend suggested we go to La Belle Province.

The inside was just like any other cheap fast food restaurant, and the decor was quite tacky. The staff at this particular location were less than enthusiastic about their jobs and appeared to be annoyed at having to even take our order, although I have worked in fast food restaurants before and I know it's not the most fun and glamorous job. 

I am a huge fan of anything hot dogs, so I decided to get the hot dog poutine. It was a large serving, but still kind of pricey for what it was. The fries were the lame pre-frozen kind and the cheese curd quite rubbery. The sauce and hot dogs were alright. I did eat the whole thing, only because I was so hungry and it seemed like a waste to spend that much on a shitty meal and not eat it.

My friend had ordered a regular hot dog and quite enjoyed it. I was pretty sure I would be sick as hell after eating, but I wasn't so I guess that's a bonus."}
{"text":"One word: POUTINE!  Yes, after strolling along St. Laurent, we decided what better place should we enjoy this calorie fest of a plate than at La Belle Province...a greasy spoon spot in its own rights.  The poutine was interesting and far from disgusting, but I don't think I'll be craving it anytime soon.  It was great fun experiencing this Canadian treat."}
{"text":"Okay, if you're hungover and you're on saint laurent after a night of clubbing, this might be the place you'll be hitting for some late night poutine.

Honestly though, the poutine here isn't that good. The cheese curds are rubbery--they literally squeak in your mouth and are not warm. The fries are also limp and are just your average frozen fries and the gravy isn't to die for either.

The staff are also over-friendly sometimes...meaning that they sometimes hit on you, and all you really want is some poutine since you're super hungry. 

If you're drunk, this place is not that bad, otherwise not worth the trip."}
