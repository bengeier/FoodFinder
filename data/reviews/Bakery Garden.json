{"text":"Very poor customer service/communication.  I went in to purchase a pasta and orange juice. The pasta took about 8min to prepare before I walked up to the cash register, where I was informed that their visa AND debit machine were broken and only accepted cash. I asked them why nobody told me when i ordered and she told me they had 2 signs up. I asked them where the sign is and she showed me....the problem with their signage was that it did not say in bold letter CASH ONLY, instead, it was a paragraph explains their debit/visa machine was broken and so they will only be accepting cash payment. The sign was not highlighted or the word cash was not even underlined. I had walked right past the sign without thinking anything of it, that was how not visible their sign were.  If both their debit AND visa machines aren't working, I believe their staff have the obligation to inform customers when they do their ordering, so that they don't waste their time like I did. They suggested I go to the bank next door, which I tried, but as I didn't bank with that particular bank, I was asked to pay a $3 convenience charge, which I was not about to pay as it was the restaurants problem, not mine. I ended up walking away without my meal feeling very annoyed having my time wasted. It did not help that the staff were unapologetic and blamed me for missing their puny sign. I will try to add a picture to this review after. Never going back."}
{"text":"Delicious afternoon Mac and cheese date spot. The food was wholesome and tasty made from scratch rather than the mass produced chains littering the usual malls. Girlfriend had the creme brûlée waffle and it was decadent. Felt like a French bistro moment. Coffee is of better quality than your usual bottom barrel chains. Come here for a lunch/afternoon to feel special and off the normal walk of life."}
{"text":"Rude staff, very high prices. For example $3.99 for 355ml of orange juice. They charge extra for the little jams. $4.00 for a butter tart. I just had a western omelette with orange juice and coffee for $15.07! My mug was chipped and they were out of clean knives."}
{"text":"The manager/owner of this establishment is one of the nicest people I have ever met. The restaurant has undergone a makeover and the new look and new menu are great. She even gave me some food to try on the house from the new menu(My friend had a smoothie..so the manager gave me a smoothie on the house to try..was amazing..She also gave other items to try as the new menu had just begun) . Much better than before..Service. Quality of food Decor..all top notch. Congratulations to the Manager/owner for doing a great job in customer service Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Getting breakfast at Bakery garden @ Bayview village. Picked up tray, lined up, waited...got my Spinach omelet (special offer $7.75 comes with bagel...great deal I think). Now holding my full tray I start looking for a seat. When I came in two tables free, and few seats at the counter. Now it's full, but many of the \"customers\" are just chatting, I guess waiting for stores to open. Standing up I eat my food. Prices great, seating not so much."}
{"text":"The worst order process ever. Yelled at me. Repeated same words at me. Refused to fix order. Driest sandwich in world. Ordered drink didn't give it to me. Please don't come here. Go across hall to aroma. Seriously."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on July 6, 2011 and found the experience quite frustrating.  There is no clear signage as to where to place an order, so I ended up standing at the sandwich counter for several minutes while being ignored by the staff. I finally decided to walk down to the cashier at the back of the restaurant to inquire as to where I should be placing an order, and she hastily directed me back to the sandwich counter. I returned and managed to get the attention of one of the staff and placed an order for a soup & sandwich. I was soon handed a bowl of soup, but no tray. I looked around in the vacinity for a tray, and had to ask where they were. They were back by the cashier. Odd, but ok. I put the soup down, retrieved a tray, came back, and waited for the sandwich. When it was all ready to go, I went back to the cashier and paid after she had messed up my drink order several times, which did nothing to improve her mood. I looked around and found a table, only to realize I hadn't been given any utensils. I looked around the tray area for spoons, but couldn't find one. I went back to the now clearly aggrivated cashier and asked her for one, and she directed me to a spot obscured in a corner behind the cashier and drink cooler.   All in all, there was no signage, and the layout of the ordering/trays/cashier/utensil station was only apparent if you're used to coming here or a member of the staff. The portion size was quite large, but I didn't want to pester the already annoyed staff with a request for to go packaging. The staff was rude and inattentive. I would not go back, since the food wasn't good enough to outweigh the poor service and bewildering lay out."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite this afternoon. In spite of going to Bayview Village often, it has been a good 10+ years since I've been here or even glanced at the BG.   When I was younger, this place was bigger with more to choose from. It halfed in size when Senses came to the Village of Bayview and then that space continued to be occupied by businesses other than the Bakery Garden. Total memory lane here... they used to have a huge oven and made the world's best bruschetta with melted cheese on it. *drooool*  My first impression of this place was ... C H A O S. You're not really sure where to line up or where the line starts. The ratio of customer to employee was like 50:1. Chaos makes me very tired.  There are quite a few tables with only one gentleman in charge of the cleaning of it. Obviously he can't clean all of them within minutes so when walking around and looking for a place to sit, many of the tables looked disgustingly dirty.  The food was 'meh.' I ordered the vegetable barley soup, which is apparently low in fat and low in calories. It was bland, but this might be due to the fact that its lacking in yummy fat. Who knows. For an additional $0.43, you could get a very stale piece of challah bread. I should have been paid the forty-three cents to eat it imo.  If I ever come here again, it will be too soon."}
{"text":"The most despicable customer service by their Persian employee Overheard her asking a senior gentleman in line behind me if he was deaf because her idea of good customer service skills is mumbling , scowling the entire time, barking orders at you & pretending to be the manager on a major power trip. This is the second time I've encountered this particular employees nasty attitude - she gives the establishment a bad name! It's unfortunate -because we used to be regulars but her unsettling attitude has left a bad taste. If the manager was any wiser he would have hired an employee to represent his business in a better light. Truly disgusting service- food is mediocre, stale and bland and not to mention over priced. Just take your business over to aroma or origin for a far more pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Today, I finally got to have a sit-down meal here after meeting up with my cousin for a brunch meal. We both went for the omelets, you can't go wrong with eggs and toast now can you? And I was right! The omelets are cooked within view of the customers and you get to see the Omelet Maker flip your order with precision. My order of ham and cheese omelet with mushrooms and toast with a side of roasted potatoes (at additional charge) filed up the plate on which they were placed and turned out tasty. Alot of the ready-made food like salads and sandwiches are also invitingly display in their respective stations. The delicious looking cakes are also well-displayed but there is not an overwhelming selection of them so that makes it easy to take your picks from the sweet choices. There's even a cute-looking bunch of gingerbread cookies among the display for this festive season. And there's an eye-catching nifty row of mugs with the Bakery Garden logo displayed on the shelves behind the counter of pastries. The moderately sized cafe is spacious enough for customers to move around while looking at the food and reading the menus. There is also enough seating inside so that the place doesn't get too filled-up with patrons. My cousin and I were there around 12pm and the cafe was getting busy enough but there was still room to move around without bumping into anyone, and we were able to get a table for the two of us. This place is definitely one of two places at Bayview Village that I'd go to for lunch or an afternoon coffee moment."}
{"text":"Located in the newly upgraded restaurant corridor of the Bayview Village Mall, this popular lunch spot offers up some reasonable home cooked fare, and a place to rest your haunches. I have been to this restaurant many times over the years. It's where my I'd eat with my family as a wee lad, halfway through being dragged around the BVSC.  But I digress, things here have been pretty stable throughout the years. The restaurant is run cafeteria style whereby you line up with a tray, order your food, grab a drink and pay. They offer a standard variety of bagels and sandwiches and a selection of different salads and cold toppings. Next they have a pasta/omelette station, where you can choose the toppings and sauces...etc. The portion is always pretty decent and it tastes AOK. There are a couple soups to choose from, little personal pizza's, you get the idea.   I recommend they improve their \"lunch specials\" and introduce some combos so that drinks may be included rather than added on top of the $8-10 meal. If your looking for something sweet, they have a nice little selection of dessert items including meringues and little cakes.  Overall, it's a nice little refuge come mid-day with some dependable options to choose from (especially if your not a fan of the insidious chocolate dispensing Aroma chain, which has taken over the former Laura Secord location right across the strip. Think a more relaxed version of Michele's Baguette."}
{"text":"The lady who cooked the pasta is friendly, but I thought I could DIY next time myself after seeing how they make it. Should go to Thai express. This restaurant needs some cleaning to be honest"}
{"text":"oh man. building up my \"date, don't rape\" list just makes me so depressed.  I came here for breakfast in the morning with some friends after a serious late night crash. how happy we were to hear and smell the omelettes sizzling. they're definite winners. they make the omelette fresh for you, so you have to wait a few minutes...but then again, the chefs are scary in their efficiency.  omelettes are yummy. perfect for the morning. I'd probably save this place for morning or brunch food--not sure about their other offerings. the salad and sandwiches didn't look particularly appetising.  bonus points: they offer \"white\" omelettes, cooked with only egg whites (no egg yolk). it's 90 cents extra and it's not racist."}
{"text":"Just because you're in a busy mall that doesn't give you permission to serve crappy food. I had a stale tuna sandwich with cheese for lunch. The service was ok but that where it ended for me. They charged me $2.30 for can of Soda!!! Really folks?? This is not a do-over & I'd choose something else waaaayyy before I go here again."}
{"text":"Lots of health code violations when I went in today.  Aside from the fact we ordered smoked salmon omelettes and what we received was more like scrambled eggs.   The smoked salmon also did not taste fresh even when cooked.   Plus, I thought the idea of eating smoke salmon was having it raw, but the Cook basically fried it and overcooked it.  What we received was scrambled salmon eggs for 11.95!   It looked really unappetizing.   The biggest concern I had was when the Cook handled raw meat before touching our bread, etc. ~ we requested refund afterwards for our food.   Wanted to order their juices, but could tell they were not up to code standards when they kept it in a bucket instead of using the fridge - stacking cups on top of one another!  The funny thing is, they put fruits and veggies in the fridge where the drinks use to be.   Really odd that they are using the fridge like a display cabinet.   I have been at this location many times before and it was never like this; and it seems like with the change of new Owners, I hope it's because they are still sorting things out and things aren't  permanently this way.   If so, I'd stay far away from this place."}
