{"text":"I had a hunkering for a burger, so when I joined my wife for lunch near her work we meandered over here for a quick meal; that was somewhat of a mistake.

Service was not rude, but not on top of things either. The food itself was rather bland; the patty looked like they literally took it out of the freezer pre-shaped and then tossed it on to the grill for 5 minutes.

I miss In-N-Out from California."}
{"text":"terribly bad value, burgers are pretty tiny relative to what yer paying and relative to other burgers similarly priced in the neighborhood. 

what really gets me though is the smell. no ventilation at all in this place. your clothes and hair will reek of greasy fry oil all day, making the afternoon at work unbearable and embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've never quite been a fan of Hero, their burgers mediocre, their prices too high.  I am a fan, however, of maintaining the strong social bond only formed when a group of co-workers peer pressure you to spending money on food you don't necessarily want.  Ya know, being a team player.  Unfortunately that drive towards team-playerability would prove hazardous to my well-being (and sure-footedness) on a fine March 14th lunch.

Arriving shortly before the lunch rush we came into an empty restaurant  ready to \"get our Hero on\" (marketing team, that's on me).  After placing my order, rearranging some finances, and promising my future second born (first born child contracts are soooo BCE) we found a table and sat down amidst an invisible fog of oil which clogged every 9 out of 10 of my smell receptors and clung to my clothes like a cute koala on a eucalyptus tree.  I was number 9.

After what seemed about 10 minutes or so my number was called.  \"Victory!\", I thought as bells rang through the chambers of my stomach. Standing up I looked upon my fellow friends and customers, no longer numerically challenged was I. I was the next to be sequentially chosen. I was a winner. I was number 9.

The first two steps towards hunger satiation were simple: Left, followed by right. I've done it a million times before, even a billion perhaps, \"I got this\"...or so I thought.

On the third step of my march towards the counter, I began to slip, not a 'w-w-w-woaaah that was a close one' slip.  This was a, \"better protect my face in case there's an open casket\" slip.  

With less friction between me and the ground than between an overly religious couple before marriage, all hope of recovery was lost.  That is, until I found hope of recovery with a chair right next to me, \"I'm saved!\".  In desperation I did a half-quarter spin, grabbed the chair with my right hand, prayed to a God that hasn't even been invented yet and attempted to regain balance.  

It was too late, the chair and I together crashed like it was 1929 all over again.  With my body, my new chair friend and my dignity on the floor I took the march of shame towards my combo.  Oddly, I had a sudden loss of appetite but proceeded anyway.

Arriving at the counter I was greeted with a blank stare and a \"ya ok?\".  Ok I was, but what I really was looking for was, oh I don't know, someone to actually pick up a mop, paper towel, set of napkins, group of sewn together sponges or anything to pick up the spilled milkshake that apparently had been biding its time, waiting to strike before we even got there.

We sat at our table, ate our meals at a comfortable pace, and just as we were about to leave, about 45 minutes after 'the incident', I hear a disproportioned set of wheels finally rolling towards the scene.

I have asked myself many questions since that day.  Why wouldn't they spend the 20 seconds to mop up the spill they knew was there when it happened?  Why wait 45 minutes after I fell to even do anything?  Who was this mystery spiller and did he get a replacement milkshake?  What sort of higher being would allow my video game and space bar thumb to suffer so?

To these questions I'll never find an answer, for those lie with someone who arrived before I. Perhaps number 3, or number 7, even number 1. None of which was me, for  I was number 9.

The burger wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Good poutines, good toppings, good veggie burger! Glad to have them in liberty village!"}
{"text":"I completely agree with Courtney - tried this place (\"hey, a new burger joint near work!\"). The burger itself was passable, nothing to write home about. I ordered onion rings - gack! The batter was WAY undercooked and the rings so greasy that they actually DRIPPED oil! Disgusting. Worse, getting back to work (after a 5 minute walk outdoors), everyone gagged - my jacket had picked up the grease odours - I guess the place is not ventilated! Took a day of airing out for my jacket to smell okay again!

I think I'll stick to Merci Mon Ami for my occasional burger treat day!"}
{"text":"Not familiar with the Hero chain so was a little overwhelmed at the number of different choices (i.e. having to list every individual salad item I wanted). The guy was so rude, like the stereotypical ditsy customer being undermined in the car mechanics.

The burger was really below par. They forgot the cheese (seems to be a common occurrence looking at the other reviews!) and the meat was poor quality.

Shame because it's right across the street from my new apartment, won't be returning."}
{"text":"I hate to admit but I am a Hero burger fan.  They have created a yummy, juicy burger.  I love love their sweet potato fries.  I prefer them to their regular fries.  They now serve milkshakes, so you can get your full burger meal.

This location is quick to serve and have friendly staff.  They are my go-to burger joint in the Liberty Village area."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. 

First, the man at the cash register was extremely rude taking our order. Second, they called our number about 10 minutes after we ordered, my partner went up to grab it, and it's only 1 out of 2 burgers that were done. Why call the number if it's not done? Third, my burger had no cheese on it even though we paid an extra dollar for it. She says \"sorry\" and slaps a piece of cheese on it. Thanks for the cold cheese slice on my burger. Fourth (yes there is a fourth!) our fries were disgusting and soggy. 

Honestly, I never expect much from this chain, but this was beyond horrible. Horrible enough that they're getting a corporate email requesting my money back. 

I will never go back to this location and my recommendation for you is HARD PASS!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving 1 stars but this Hero Burger deserves 0.

First off the cashier wasn't friendly at all. I told him I'd like a burger and he just looks at me silently. I then realized he wanted me to pick toppings. A simple \"what would you like on the burger\" would be nice.

When we ordered we were number 90 and 87 had just been called. About 10 minutes later our ticket was announced. After approaching the window the cook told us only half the meal was ready... Why did you call me up if it wasn't ready? She began cooking the other burger and we got it in another 5 minutes.

My partner paid $0.99 extra for cheese that they forgot. When he went up they just plopped a piece of cold cheddar cheese in. Pictures on the menu showed the cheese melted and delicious while ours looked cold and unappetizing.

Finally to top things off, avoid the fries. They were really soggy. Biggest regret was not checking Yelp before going in thinking we could rely on the Hero brand. Never again."}
{"text":"Fast food, two words that are revolting in the mind of most food luvers.  There are exceptions of course but sadly this place is not one of them. 
They do market themself as selling Angus Beef Raised without Hormones or Antibiotics Gluten-Free / Halal Certified (wow that's a mouthful) 
I went for the classic burger of which there are 3 options (4, 6 and 8 Oz) 
you get a choice of bread (with or without up charge) and then there quite a few options for cheese, condiments and extras. 
IMO its a hybrid of something like McDonalds and Subway. 
They do have sweet potato fries which I like order whenever see em.  Partners in crime also ordered Onion rings and normal fries. They went for a combo though.
Sadly we were behind a huge order and had to wait quite a bit to get our food. 
They combos can cross 10$ mark real fast so I thought this better be good.
We had a take out but I started munching on my fries while we walked back. 
Now for the main attraction the burger looks OK similar to other fast food joints as for the taste it was OK not great better than Big Mac for sure but is it better than the whopper hmm IMO no.
Sweet potato fries were decent.
2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Loser Burger!

After the customer ahead of me was finished ordering the girl working the cash looked at me told me it was her break and walked away on her cellphone. I had to yell back and forth with the guy working the grill in the back to make my order. Did I mention the food sucked? Never again!"}
{"text":"Had never tried Hero before but since this chain opened in my neighbourhood and I was starving and craving a burger I figured I'd give them a go. Wow I wish I could have my $11 back!  For the price I was expecting something way better! I could not even eat it, it was a horrible frozen patty with awful taste and texture. I give them 1 star for the fries which I rather enjoyed but I will definitely not be returning.  Wish they had of opened a five guys or burgers priest instead!"}
{"text":"Never again with this place.  I only went there because it was next to the dollar store, where i picked up some xmas wrappings.  I ordered a quick burger to take back to my desk during my lunch break.  When i got back, the grease from the burger patty literally soaked and dissipated the lower bun as well as the paper bag it was being held in. They put the blue cheese on the bottom side of the patty, not top, the fries were soggy, the burger patty was so greasy that it literally took a couple of paper towels to get it to a moderate grease level and the mushrooms were covered in greasy char.  the only saving grace?  the cola from the fountain machine.  All this for $14 bucks, no thank you.  I could've went to mcdonalds and got a way better experience and this saying a lot!

will never eat here again, as i write this i'm starting to feel a bit queezy from the food."}
{"text":"I'm a burger person. Possibly the best thing in the world. Apart from the fact that I'm trying to go healthy and avoid meat, tonight I needed some comfort food.

Long story short, it was the first time in my life that I didn't finish my burger even though I was starving. Certified Disgusting! 
It was like chewing tofu that has gone bad. 
I wish I didn't stop myself and have gone to Wendy's.
I'm eating crackers right now to change the taste in my mouth.
Like why???"}
{"text":"Ladies were smoking outside.  They had to enter the store after me.  Anyways I had a bday coupon which was only redeemable printed.  A bit disappointed especially in our generation of high technology and environmental issues.  You'd think showing it on my mobile screen would be good enough.  And the email didn't even have a code."}
{"text":"This is an excellent burger joint in liberty village that does it's own meat!  I usually order the large beef burger (8oz) which actually comes as two smaller patties (4oz).  The most important thing about any burger is the meet and this meet tastes amazing!  I really hate places which have burgers that taste like they are from Costco.  If I want to eat Costco burgers I'll go buy them at Costco.  

I don't get what others are whining about - this is the best burger meat in Liberty Village, bar none!  I always add a fried egg on top of my double burger here (only $1.25 extra) and the combo is amazing! I also always get my burger on Ciabatta bread (+0.75) so the juice from the patties never make the bun soggy.

The place is pretty clean, the staff are not bad, sometimes a bit slow, but nothing to get excited about.  Again I see others here bitching about the cleanliness and vibes at this place, but they were fine every time I've been there.  Maybe too much of great expectations, eh?  The burgers are not cheap, but then nothing is in LI.

And PLEASE don't whine about your coupons! Who uses coupons nowadays anyway???!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Absolutely horrible service. There's only ever one person working and he always takes his sweet-ass time. So frustrating."}
{"text":"Best hero burger location I've been to. amazing service! The employees went out of their way to make the experience great."}
