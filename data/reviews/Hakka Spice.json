{"text":"Yummy! We visited Hakka Spice late one Thursday evening a few weeks ago. We were graciously greeted and shown a table, even though they were closing in 30 minutes, we were never rushed! We ordered two dishes and it was plenty for two people.   \"South African Fries\" to start. This is a dish of spiced French Fries topped with chopped onion, bell peppers and cilantro. The fries are wedge-shaped which gives more surface area for the dry rub to stick to. Very tasty, very filling and spicy! We had to force ourselves to stop to save space for the main, \"Manchurian Eggplant\". This is a stir-fried eggplant in the staple of Hakka cuisine, the Manchurian gravy. The eggplant was steaming hot, perfectly cooked and it was so fresh and sweet! The gravy was a good blend of ginger and Hakka spices, and to our delight, not too salty or oily! We ate until we were stuffed and still had enough leftover for one meal the next day. Thanks! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"At Hakka places I tend to order only two Dishes: Singapore noodles and shrimp fried rice; the shrimp fried rice was just so-so and will not order again; the Singapore noodles was good; got alot of food but shrimps were lacking;   The location will be a struggle as a few restaurants have been thru that space, but if they get a big sign by the road they might get noticed;"}
{"text":"Their General Tao's Chicken is delicious!  I order about twice a week for lunch.  Price is $10.15 incl. tax.  For those that think it's spicy and don't like hot food, don't worry.  It looks spicier than it really is.  The sauce is so good. More sweet than hot, but tastes great.  Lunch combo comes with salad portion, rice, 2 spring rolls and a spicy soup.  Soup is good, but it's the spiciest portion.  I like it, but if you can't handle hot food, you may not.   There's also the option of buying just chicken and rice portion.  It comes with more chicken and rice, but it's about $12.50 incl. tax.  I also recommend their Manchurian Chicken.  Tastes great as well.  Give it a try!  C.L."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place and ordered the Crispy Beef and Hakka Chicken Chowmein. When it arrived, I thought it appeared darker than usual. Tasted it and it tasted like burnt meat. While it was crispy, the beef was charred badly and covered up with a sweet honey sauce.  Every piece thoroughly burned and coated in sauce. It tasted awful and was inedible! The Chowmein had traces of burnt crumbs on the noodles and included literally 3 pieces of chicken. Each dish was $10.50 for which we expected a decent proportion of chicken to noodles. Otherwise, the place appeared clean with friendly service."}
{"text":"This is an amazing addition to the Winston/Dundas food scene and adds a much needed change.   The food in and of itself is nothing to write home about. The guy taking the orders is friendly enough- we got our food to go so I cannot comment on the table side customer service. I must mention the portions are what a true Hakka place should be - enough to feed a family of 4 easily if you stick to the standard one meat and one rice dish.   Our food was still hot when we got home so we were happy about that. So we ordered the Hakka staples - chicken lollipops, chicken corn soup, house special fried rice and chilli chicken.   The chicken lollipops were delicious and juicy. The chilli chicken was made with an extreme amount of soy sauce so it was very salty and the gravy itself was quite dark. The chicken corn soup was tasteless with large chunks of chicken - add the chili vinegar which they thankfully provide and some soy sauce and it saved the soup to make it yummy! The fried rice was good - but it wasn't true Hakka style fried rice - it did not have that fire kissed char flavour you look for in great fried rice.   Overall I will definitely come back because it's so close by and in a great location. They offer wonderful lunch specials which I would suggest making use of it so that you can try different things each time!   A must try is the chicken lollipops - they aren't as good as Hakka Legend but they hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Updated Jan-2018 The Manchurian was again amazing the sauce/gravy is the star of the dish. The Hot n Sour Soup was great, a little bit more spicy hot for the family, however perfect for me. The Szechuan Paneer Fried Rice was for the family and they loved it. The spice again a bit on the higher side than expected, but good. However we requested NO eggs in the Fried Rice and towards the end we found a few pieces of eggs. All Indian restaurant chefs know that one DOES NOT put eggs in a Vegetarian dish. Disappointing to say the least   Was in the neighbourhood and daughter was looking for something not fast food. Had been to Longo's nearby and seen this sign a week ago. Decided to give it a try, but wanted something to take home.   The inside is still not ready as of yet. The decor inside seems incomplete and does not seem to be a place where you can still eat in. When inquired found out that the restaurant had opened less than three weeks ago. Once complete would surely give it a try.   Picked up a Veggie Manchurian and a Vegetarian Fried Rice. No waiters just the owner/manager busy with some big takeout order. The Manchurian comes with an order of steamed rice.   The Manchurian was spot on. Perfectly spiced, good flavour. The pakoras was a bit soggy for us, but perhaps it was take out. The Fried Rice was amazing. The rice was long grain rice and not sticky rice kind. The rice not at all greasy which we like. The spices used was different and came out authentic Hakka taste; Indian Style. Not too spicy and perfect blend of rice and spices. The veggies couldn't have been a bit more.   The plain rice was good.   All in all, good food, averagely priced. But the taste was amazing. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes and perhaps do a sit in."}
{"text":"Not very busy, but friendly service. If Halal is important to you this place also fits that bill. Ambiance is good, it's clean, well maintained and airy. Portion was quite good (though I missed the lunch specials by 5 minutes) value for the money, chili chicken was spicy and flavour filled, with an ample serving of rice.  They don't really check up on you if your dining in, so if you want more water or something your going to be kind of on your own. There was only myself and one other table while I was there.  I'd go back, but maybe more for takeout."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  There was a chicken place in here, then another Hakka place called Hakka tonight which was not so good.  We went in very hesitant and tried the Dry Chilli Chicken and the Chicken and Shrimp Chow Mein.    We went back and had the Manchurian Chicken (wet) and the Crispy Beef.  Exceptional good quality for such an unassuming place.  It's a mom and pop operation but the food really was exceptional for the price they charge.  Full of flavour and taste.  Decor is lacking a bit of ambience but hopefully that changes as they get more successful.  If they keep the quality and taste up I can see this place being a regular for us."}
{"text":"After reading the few reviews here, we decided to order some take out for dinner.  We ordered lollipop chicken (as the last reviewers raved about it), chicken corn soup, spicy cauliflower, pakora.  The lollipop chicken was raw inside. We called back the restaurant to complain. The lady who picked up the phone refused to acknowledge that they did a mistake and insisted that the chicken was cooked properly.  Extremely poor service.  The rest of the food was not impressive.  After the treatment we had, we would NOT recommend this place.   Please note that this happened in the spring.  We tried it again recently to give a fair review, service and food were both poor."}
{"text":"This is a solid place. First of all, the lunch special is a steal. For $8.99 plus tax you get a ton of food-- salad, soup, two spring rolls, and a main dish served with steamed rice.   Our take-out order consisted of a Manchurian chicken lunch special, fried eggplant in Manchurian sauce and vegetable pakoras. I had to wait 20-25 minutes for the order because of the pakoras which I didn't mind.  My dad enjoyed his lunch special and was so full, he could barely finish everything. I enjoyed the fried eggplant dish. I would order it again, and would be up for trying it with a different sauce or ordering something completely different next time. The vegetable pakoras were good, but I prefer the onion pakoras from Oh Bombay across the street (which are also cheaper I think).  I would've liked to order a lunch special for myself but they only had a couple of vegan options available. So I just ordered the fried eggplant from the regular menu which comes with a side of rice.  FYI -- When they say spicy they really mean spicy lol. The spice levels are elevated here... My mild machurian eggplant seemed more medium. I asked for the Manchurian chicken at medium spice level for my father... He loves heat but thought even the medium was more like spicy lol. They can adjust the heat level indicated on the menu for some dishes so feel free to ask. This was our first visit so we'll know to go one spice level lower for next time.  Overall it seems like good food and we'll order again!"}
{"text":"After reading the first review for this restaurant, I was convinced enough to try them out at least once. The restaurant ambience is well enough, the staff was courteous. Though this place does seem family owned and run. I ordered the Lollipop chicken which were delicious, and the same goes for the Chilli Chicken & Chicken fried rice. But the only item that thoroughly disappointed me was the house special soup, it was chicken corn soup with shrimp added.   I think in the future soups will never be in my order. Anyways I hope to go back again & try other item's in the menu. Let's hope i'am pleasantly surprised and not shocked."}
{"text":"We got takeout from Hakka Spice the other night and wow, everything was delicious!  We had the mixed masala fried rice which had shrimp, chicken and beef as well as some veggies and egg. It was quite spicy and very tasty.   We had the spicy ginger beef which was in a gravy and was VERY spicy but sooo good! Not for the faint of heart lol.   We also had the butter chicken masala. It wasn't spicy, but was just the right creaminess with just a hint of sweetness.    The lady at the cash was very friendly and efficient.   We'll definitely be back for more spicy deliciousness!!"}
