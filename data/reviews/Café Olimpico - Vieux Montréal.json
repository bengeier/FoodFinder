{"text":"My brother and I go to Olimpico on a nightly basis. Helps that I live three blocks away. Bartenders are super cool and know how to brew a great coffee. Décor is super chill and brings a great look to the ancient building it occupies.  Gelatos are really good and I often bring my little one for a scoop. Would recommend this to anyone hanging out in the Old Port. You won't find better value for your money, trust me!"}
{"text":"Our tour guide told us about this cafe. Amazing authentic Italian coffee. The building of the coffee shop use to be a Montreal old town warehouse. Enjoyed the ice latte and the relaxing historical shop."}
{"text":"Tout y est parfait, du fantastique café aux pâtisseries, en passant par le merveilleux service offert à chaque passage."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Had the best coffees and conversation with the employees!! Such a great little gem tucked away behind Hotel William Gray! The drinks are delicious and made with such care. The pastries are equally just as good. We appreciated the late hours and quietness of the cafe. We came each day we stayed in Montreal we loved it so much! They have lots of regulars and I can see why."}
{"text":"Not the same vibe as Mile End One. The cappuccino isn't the same either. But nonetheless, the cappuccino is good. It had the sweet soft foam with cocoa. They use white sugar here instead of brown sugar which I think alters the taste. The playlist is entirely different in the old port one: much more electronic instead of pop rock. The cafe is part of a boutique hotel so expect a lot of tourists here. The ambience is very preppy and uptight which suits the Old Port location. Barista is great and friendly though, the only thing similar to the Mile End branch."}
{"text":"The coffee isnt as great as the one in St viateur. The cafe is in old port which is convenient and has great views. This cafe has a completely different vibe than the one in saint viateur."}
{"text":"What says vacation coffee more than an Affogato (Ice Cream topped with Espresso shot?) Nothing. Except when it's paired by running into one of your favorite musicians you just saw at the festival in which you traveled for (Vance Joy!)  This is the kind of place I would desire to spend a ton of time in if it were in Tulsa. Cozy, relaxed and all around an inspiring place to be. My affogato was truly picturesque and equally as decadent to eat. The espresso was so impressive I hopped back in line after to get an Americano to-go."}
{"text":"My favourite café in Montreal. The coffee is amazing and the service is second to none. They make you feel at home whether you're just grabbing a cappuccino or spending the day working from there.   Ask for the off-the-menu cold coffee remix, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very clean, gorgeous little cafe!! Very welcoming host and the coffee is what coffee should be, amazing! Try the crema...   wow!! Going back when the gelato comes out!!!!  I know it's going to be simply delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Was strollin through Old Port on a brisk afternoon, and stumbled upon this Cafe Olimpico. I've been to the one in Mile End, which I typically enjoy, so it was good to find a familiar spot that isn't named Barstucks. However, unlike the one in Mile End, this one is very small (or to put it kindly, \"intimate\"), with 4 bar tables and a couple other small tables. There was one barista which was probably enough; a pleasant gentleman who was quite skilled with handling multiple orders and tasks. I ordered the Allongé (a long pour espresso), which was delicious, along with a croissant. I imagine this place is better for folks on the go who don't plan on hanging out here, but if you happen to come at a time when it isn't busy, having a seat and sipping your coffee slow is a good choice."}
{"text":"Great prices for quality coffee.  The espresso cream was perfect. Friendly barista.  Will go back when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe, definitely a nice spot to stop by in Old Port - Caffe Freddo was on point!"}
{"text":"Popped in just for a coffee and never regretted it! The server was so kind and helpful. The coffee was even better!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop with delicious coffee and friendly baristas. The lattes were small and perfect. We also encountered Justin Trudeau just outside as he was going for a jog after meetings next door. What a way to mark a touristy trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This cafe located in Old Montreal cozy without being claustrophobic. The staff are friendly without being intrusive. And the cappuccino. Oh the cappuccino. The cappuccino has the right amount of foam and consistency. Worthy of many returns."}
{"text":"This cafe and the view of Old Port are  the best perks for staying in Hotel William Gray.  We got coffee, gelato, pastries, or what-have-you every day we stayed...all were wonderful!    Madame particularly liked the slushy machine coffee.  The espresso and the cappuccino were both very on point.    Dog friendly!  Also a great spot for hotel gossip.   This is where I learned Lady Gaga was staying in the HWG.  I only regret I didn't get a chance to try the St-vietur location."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to try their affogato, but they didn't have it so we tried other things.   Latte was delicious! I usually don't like adding any sugar into my espresso drink if it's good beans it's worth drinking just with milk/soy milk and the shots   Bomblane; it's like a donut filled with filings. It was alright, wouldn't get again.     Service was awesome, our barista is very good and with a genuine smile."}
{"text":"Very small place, good service average cafe. Tables under airducts very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My fav kind of cafe is located on a lively st, is bright with large windows, has great coffee, some freshly baked goodies, comfy chairs and a cozy vibe.  The location of cafe olimpico is perfect: its in old Montreal but off the busiest st. It's small, but with the stone walls and old windows it has a charming character. That is except the jangly club music they were playing when we visited :( My almond latte was pretty good, though served in a glass which was kinda inconvenient. My friend and i shared a biscotti which was quite sweet and had a surprisingly chewy texture - the taste was alright, but perhaps it should be given a different name? I'm generally not a fan of high chairs as i find them uncomfortable; but, and this is the highlight of this place for me, there is window sill seating with pillows here and there, overlooking stone paved streets of old port and all the lively restaurants... So not the perfect place to work, or to have a long chat w/ a friend; but excellent for people watching or a date with a fav book :)"}
{"text":"This is a little tiny location, but my latte was AMAZING! It was smooth and delicious. The barista was friendly and quick, and made sure my drink was just how I wanted it.  The cafe is small, and seating is limited. However, it is attached to a hotel, so you can sit in the hotel lobby if need be if there's not enough seating. I found the location secluded and peaceful - a nice change from the Mile End location (which we also visited while in Montreal)."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop tucked away in a small narrow road in Old Montreal. The coffee here is perfection! You can certainly enjoy some sweets and baked goods while you're here too.   I also liked the space with its exposed brick, high top chairs, and the cute cushions on the window sills offer extra seating. The cafe has a laid back vibe and is much quieter than some other places in the old port which I totally enjoyed after walking around on the busy and crowded streets of Le Vieux Port.   Warning that sitting is limited but you can always enjoy your coffee standing along the long marble coffee bar!"}
{"text":"Non mais, quand t'as envie d'un bon café très tôt le matin, David, le gentil Barista du Café Olimpico est prêt, avec un grand sourire et un excellent café! Je me suis même laissé tenter par une chocolatine qui.. m'a donné envie d'en manger une autre. Deux cafés et une excellente conversation plus tard, ma journée était partie sur un excellent pied! Merci pour ton accueil David, on se revoit très bientôt!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop Friendly bartender, tasty coffee and a relaxing atmosphere  Besides if you get coffee here you can go to the terrace at the top of hotel next door to enjoy the view of old port"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato, chill vibe, dope playlist (Mos Def, CL Smooth & Pete Rock), sleek decor, mad cool peeps.   The workers here very friendly and super cool to talk to. We would definitely come back each and every time we visit Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Their lemon cake was superb. It didn't overwhelm and had the perfect amount of sweet and savory. For me, it's a struggle to find a flaw with this cafe. The service was efficient but helpful and attentive. The ambiance, unlike many tourist traps in the area was authentic and the prices to die for. Certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"The coffee and biscotti taste great. The rustic interior is beautiful. It's the kind of place you want to relax in, sip a coffee, and observe the passersby."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my coffee at cafe olimpico ! It was my first time trying it and I had the cafe freddo (iced coffee). It had great bold flavour and was very refreshing! The location isn't huge but it's in a nice area of old Montreal and there is seating inside. Great cozy interior with friendly service and reasonable pricing. I definitely recommend this place for a quiet coffee with a friend or a date , may not be a great choice for a big group though due to limited seating."}
{"text":"Who knew I'd be in Canada, sitting in an Italian cafe, and listening to Rick James. Yes, I could have hung out here all day. It's not a large place, but the atmosphere is chill and the guy that works there is chill, so why not hang out here all day? Plus, he didn't get super annoyed that we weren't fluent in French (like most other places we went to in Montreal).  I ordered a latte and he asked me how much sugar I wanted. Ok, maybe it's an American thing but I've never been asked how much sugar I want in a latte. Normally, they just serve it to you and you have to figure out the rest. I was also trippin' that my hot latte came in a glass and not a ceramic mug. Again, I don't know if Montreal is just way cooler than the States (ok, I mean it kinda was), but it made me feel fancy. Oh, and the latte was good. We also ordered the donuts and they were delicious. Not too sweet, but just sweet enough.  Yea, this was the jam for me."}
{"text":"Cappuccino was meh.  Service okay.  Great location off of the William Gray hotel.  Easy walk to any location in Vieux Montreal."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee place in Montreal so far! We found this little gem through yelp and decided to give it a try before the Bascilica. I personally had the mocha and it was the BEST mocha coffee I have ever had. My friends got an americano and lattes; they were equally pleased with their orders. Not only are the coffees amazing, it's connected to a cute little boutique store that sells a bunch of items including Adidas, Nike, Hershel and much more. For those who can't find seating at the café, there's more seating in the back! Just go through the little boutique store and it opens up to a beautiful hotel lobby. There's tons of seating in the lobby with amazing decors. We also saw people playing pool in the back which is also available to people. Overall, I loved the coffee itself and the ambiance both within the cafe and the connected hotel lobby."}
