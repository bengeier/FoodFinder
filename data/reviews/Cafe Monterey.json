{"text":"I was very sceptical when I saw the menue. Dishes from India, Japan (Sushi etc.), Morocco und classic Canada are combined. I went for the Indian lentils and they were delicious! Not only a superb taste also the presentation and the service was great. Only four points because I feel it's slightly overpriced. The place is in the big old hotel lobby next to the pool, kind of outdated."}
{"text":"From my experience, hotels and restaurants rarely do well together (unless you're in Vegas of course) but Cafe Monterey was a pleasant surprise to try out.

It's kind of confusing to get here first of all, because of where the hotel sits, you may have to go through a car dealership right next door to get to their parking lot (which is through a gate, which means you have to pay; first two hours are free with validation). But once you get there and park, the restaurant is not hard to miss as it's on the first floor through the lobby.

I like how the restaurant is open to the hotel in that there're no walls or a conference room converted to a restaurant space. The hotel space is the restaurant space which has a nice open feeling to it.

The service was great and quick. The menu is very eclectic and honestly a bit too big but I was finally able to figure out what I wanted to get (Buffalo Burger) and it was pretty good. Despite my wariness, my cousin ordered sushi rolls and they were surprisingly good.

I'd definitely come back here when I'm in TO.

Parking: Hotel parking, first 2 hours free with validation
Price: $10+
Wait: 15 mins after ordering"}
{"text":"OK a very good restaurant in a Holiday Inn in Toronto, really? Yes!  Trout tender and not over cooked with perfectly cooked veggies.  Tandoori chicken so tender and perfectly spiced.  The Naan wasn't done correctly but overall the restaurant was a nice surprise... Nice selection of local wines selected by the Chef Kalvin Keigher who did come by the guests!"}
{"text":"I remember having the Breakfast Buffet there, the selection for food was unbelievable, and huge, it felt like i was a kid in a candy store. Our server Vesna, was very polite, and helpful. She makes the place brighter, and seems to make that place enjoyable. If you ever get the chance to go here, it's located in the Yorkdale Holiday Inn, I recommend it, and if you manage to get Vesna as your server you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the sushi bar because the Milestones in Yorkdale is closed. It was a bit odd because there were kids in the pool on one side, and kids playing ping pong on another, but it wasn't as off-putting as one might think.

My guest had the sunomono salad and I had the spider roll. Both were fine. 

The next morning we had the buffet breakfast. Lots of options, something for everyone. They offered GF muffins, an omelette station, fresh fruit, smoked salmon and hot and cold cereals. The buffet is $24 per person, but you receive a discount card when you check-in. There is another card for free appetizer, and a third discount card that can be used at Caf√© Monterey and the sushi bar.

Service at both meals was surprisingly good."}
