{"text":"Today I got the burger combo  ($6) which includes a very large drink, loads of fries, dill pickle spear, tomato, shredded lettuce & onion slice. The menu has a wide range of food choices. I've eaten here 3 times and the food is non-greasy and seasoned to perfection...this chef knows what he's doing!  For such a small place inside a grocery store (American Discount, which also has smokin' bargains), I'm impressed!  And it doesn't matter if you're hungry for breakfast at 3p or lunch at 9a, they serve it up. Dessert? How about an assortment of ice cream flavors in a cone for a buck? Place your order and have a seat. Sometimes there's a wait for your food, BUT you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We chose West Grill for breakfast yesterday. We had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, biscuits & gravy, & the ham & cheese omelette. SO GOOD!!..that gravy! Those biscuits! Omelette loaded with ham & cheese. The burrito was large & the chorizo was not greasy. Around $13 total + leftovers + the owners friendliness = an all around winner!! Thank You, West Grill!! See you soon"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough. This place is located in American Discount foods, and it used to be a small cafe run by the discount food workers. Although the cafe used to be really cheap, the food was not that great and the service was meh. They took the previous cafe out, and put 1360 west grill in. Headed by a professional chef, this place is FANTASTIC. Great prices, (although not American discount prices if you are familiar with that store, but you pay for what you get) extremely friendly service, and FRESH FRESH FRESH food!!! The guy who owns the place really cares about the food and what you think. I've had their daily special 3 or 4 times and it's been great every single time. I even tried foods that I didn't like previously (thanks to Apple bees and other mega chain restaurants) like zucchini fries, and it honestly was the best thing I had EVER tasted. The zucchini was crisp and fresh, and the fried part was piping hot, it was a perfect combination. Their house salsa is also great if you get a burrito. I cannot recommend this place enough, I live too far to go here everyday but if you are near by please go to this small cafe. I really want this place to blossom and be successful, because I honestly think the food and the people deserve it."}
{"text":"Located inside American Discount the 1360 W Grill is a Favorite on our weekly trip for groceries. Today their special is Clam Chowder and it is the best I have had in any Arizona restaurants that I have tried - better than many Pacific Coast famous restaurants.  Their Beer Battered Fish and Chips are fabulous as well - CAN'T be beaten for any price"}
{"text":"We love this place! This grill has amazing food! The food is fresh food. Not any of this frozen stuff, plus the portion sizes are more then generous for the price. The prices are more then fair. We have had several breakfast items and eaten lunch multiple times too. Always love the friendly service they have here. Pair that with the great tasting food at great prices. Don't hesitate to come here. I can feed my 4 kids for about $20 here, with leftover to carry home. I can't do that anywhere else. But mostly I am just happy that it's all fresh food. They press their own burgers, bread the chicken tenders, make the cheese sauce, etc."}
{"text":"What a surprise.  Just like mom used to make breakfast. Which is what I've been back for again and again. Fresh, simple and absolutely delicious.  You wouldn't think you'd find a really good restaurant inside the American Disount Foods store, but we tried it one day while checking out the deals inside the store and we're so glad we did. The owner is so nice and really cares about your business. The food is prepared hot and fresh. I love their omlette breakfast. It comes with toast and home fries. Today I tried the sausage breakfast burrito. Yum... Everything is perfectly cooked and the portions are generous. The pictures do not do this place justice but if you like mom and pop restaurants definitely give this place a try. I'm not affiliated in any way. It is the food and customer service that prompted me to write this review."}
{"text":"Had the Fish and Chips special. .What a nice surprise.Not greasy at all."}
{"text":"The food is good and an amazing value. The staff is so friendly, too. You can tell they appreciate the business."}
{"text":"Nice people. Good value. The hours are not the same as the store hours. The restaurant is under new management. The appearance looks cleaner and more professional than before. They brought me my food out to my table. Polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and always hot and fresh. They ALWAYS have Daily Specials, and the portions are well worth the price.  If there isn't an item you want just ask and they will try to accommodate your needs and request.  Everyone that works this are always happy and smiling it's a very happy and pleasant atmosphere."}
