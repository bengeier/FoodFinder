{"text":"This is decent, if Americanized noodle cuisine.  Lot of sugar in everything.  Cool bar and unfinished concrete urban decor.  Nice to drop by if in the neighborhood, but real Asian food is just right down central without any pretense of fusion.  Also, fusion."}
{"text":"***EDIT*** This place recently closed. Boo hoo!

I have come here a couple times, with friends from out of town, or on a bar-hopping whim, and pretty much every visit has been weird.  The food seems a tad overpriced, but that isn't to say there aren't delicious items on the menu - I seem to remember being seduced by a delicious curry sauce that accompanied some steamed mussels. 

Yet as some people have mentioned, food can be overlooked when the service is poor or snobby.  I don't particularly enjoy feeling out of the loop or not cool enough when I'm giving money to a place for dinner instead of eating at home.  As another reviewer stated, going in there for a drink or to pick up take-out can be something to dread.

Some friends and I went to the bar for drinks and were treated with an indifferent/rude attitude from the bartender (AKA the owner herself), who seemed to favor the regulars sitting at the other end of the bar.  We got the cold shoulder... which I think is weird because, again, I'm here to give you money for a beer instead of buying a six-pack and drinking it at home."}
{"text":"With its exposed rafters and minimalist design, the decor intrigued me at first. I really like Creation's meat dishes, particularly the chicken satay and Bangkok beef. It's a nice place to meet a friend for dinner and a glass of wine.

They do takeout orders, but it often feels like too much work. Many nights, there is a crowd of regulars at the bar there. When you walk in to get your takeout and head to the bar in hopes of finding someone who can help you, the regulars just look at you like you're in the wrong place. 
I'm pretty much always pleased with the food, but it shouldn't be a daunting task to pick up an order on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Creation is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. There are lots of things that are great, from the decor to the prices to the service...it's one of the places I come back to again and again, and I like to bring friends who are visiting from out of town here.

My favorite thing on the menu is the cabbage wraps with tofu. It's too much, which means I can bring some home. The half-price bottles of wine on Sundays are (obviously) an awesome asset as well. 

It's a minimalist, warehouse kind of feeling inside. I love the big windows, the clean spaces, and the muted colors. The bar is nice as well, and it makes for a great escape from the Penguin's weekend frenzy if you want to be able to breathe and hear the folks you are with talking."}
{"text":"Creation has asian-indian-thai inspired dishes - think noodles and curry.  I think that they have a sushi night as well, but I haven't been over to try it?  Why, you ask?  Ummm... bad too-cool-for-school service.  We walked in the back door (which is right off the parking lot and is probably where most people enter) and stood around for a few awkward minutes while some dude who worked there (who we later realized was the OWNER) stared us down.  We even waved to him to see if he would give us an indication of where we should go to be seated - he actually just LOOKED AWAY from us and no one helped us!  What a great manager!  It is no wonder this place is always almost completely empty.  Surprisingly, we still sat down for dinner.  It is so uncomfortable in there - the chairs are folding chairs that I guess are made of bamboo or something, and when you shift forward they fold up on you!!  Unreal!!  I just can't believe this place hasn't shut down yet.  The dishes are decent though - since it is in my hood I will probably go back when I feel like eating some curry and getting treated like crap."}
