{"text":"My wife and I just went to Fatso's for the 2nd and LAST time recently. We sat at the bar and the 3 \"gentlemen\" (one was a high school coach) who sat on the other side of my wife carried on an audible conversation laced with numerous \"F\" bombs. The bartender/owner said nothing as these \"gentlemen were regular customers. To top that the pizza we ordered was tasteless and the crust was more like cardboard. After we each ate a small piece, we had it boxed, left and put it in the trash...end of story."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza . Could not even force it down . Buyer beware . I would have  no stars but app had me check one to complete review"}
{"text":"Good food but very rude staff. Opened 15 minutes late on our arrival and just told us to wait outside until they finished cleaning restrooms. Not really what you expect to hear when arriving to eat lunch."}
{"text":"I am Rating by quality of the pizza. I came in just for a soda and decided to try the pizza. I sat in the cafe area and not the bar. The guys were really nice when they did make it over but i was left alone a bit. The bar, obviously the main focus. Im sure there was better service at the bar.  The Pizza.   I, like every one, love pizza and eat it a lot. But i don't like cheaply made commercial crap pizza. If you like Taco bell, Berger king, Dominos, Pizza hut and other low grade food thats fine. There is a time and place for that. When i eat pizza i want a nicely risen crispy crust, an appropriate to conservative amount of sauce and quality cheese.    What i received was loose doughy crust, not crispy. I don't know if it was pre bought, pre made or frozen. It was wet with tons of over sweetened sauce and had a little cheese. The cheese swimming in sauce. I really wanted to like this pizza because the guys were so nice but i left sincerely believing i had just tried the worst pizza i have ever had in Phoenix. Wait it was the worst pizza I've had anywhere. I was only able to eat one slice of a small personal pizza. I think the closest i could compare the pizza to was time a friend took me to hungry howies.     I am posting this for the pizza connoisseurs. If you are going for the bar it looks like they were doing a great job."}
{"text":"Great pizza, solid baked wings, and a nice selection of draft beer. Try the specialty pies including the Killer and the Great White.  Nice, friendly staff and a lot of regulars at the bar.  Live music on the weekends.  The only problem I have is that they close a bit early for weekend nights, so make sure you are there before 9 to get your pizza order in, because if it's slow they may have shut down the kitchen early."}
{"text":"First time coming to Fatso's pizza and we receive and unwelcoming vibe from the waitress. She had no costumer service and she made it seem like she definitely did not want to be at her job. Very empty and lonely place. The pizza was cold once it was handed to us. She did not come back to ask if we were doing okay, and there was no more then 10 people at the restaurant. She was very impatient when we were asking for our food. Definitely not coming back to that place. Very disappointed in the costumer service and upset with the poor quality they had."}
{"text":"I love pizza and the price of everything in the restaurant definitely made it worth it too, the pizza was pretty good and I did like it. I'm pretty boring when it comes to pizza mainly because I don't really like too much on pizza and just prefer the whole simplicity of cheese and tomato pizza and will continue to keep picking it no matter where I go.   It's definitely a great place to go for the kids though, my daughter is quite the little meat eater and she definitely liked her Pizza and I will take her back there because she forced me to promise.   Unfortunately we aren't in Phoenix that much and when I do there, I'm usually there for my job which is a real pain in the ass because it takes up so much time out of my day but I will definitely make the effort for her."}
{"text":"Strip mall pizza place. Location had a unique mothy ball smell, like a old smell. Odor was hard to miss or forget.  Restaurant seating up front. Larger bar area in back. Old decor, pink walls and green carpet.  Several TV's Attentive staff. They have soft pretzels. Pizza sauce is tasty.  Chicago style pizza. Little squares. Nice tasting pizza. They advertise live music on Thursday Friday and Saturday nights.  Outdoor seating also. Overall experience was okay. Probably would not run back"}
{"text":"Great food and beer! Great service! Can't say this enough. The wings are fantastic. You can tell these people take pride in everything."}
{"text":"Fatso's is a neighborhood pizza joint with a great selection of beers on tap, friendly staff and a casual atmosphere. When they have live music, its usually pretty darn good!! We've eaten there several times and have always enjoyed the pizza. I especially love their POPEYE and SOUTHWESTERN pizzas.  My only complaint would be that this place desperately needs a makeover... they need to remodel the interior, they need to redesign their menus, website and logo. When we eat there, I always say to myself... this place has such great potential. I wish the interior reflected how good their pizza is. (If it did, I'd probably eat there more often and be more likely to recommend it to others.)  The food probably deserves 4 stars, but the atmosphere gets a 2... so that's how I ended up with 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was really hopeful for this place! Disappointed with my cold pizza.   I just moved to the neighborhood and was craving pizza and wings to go along with some Sunday football game watching at home.   I called and placed my order, thin crust cheese pizza and honey BBQ wings. I asked for delivery and the girl told me they don't deliver until 5pm on Sundays. Bummer. I agreed to pick up. She told me it would be ready in about 20 minutes.   22 minutes later (I hate cold pizza so I usually show up 5-10 mins early but couldn't this time) I arrived.  First thing I noticed was a nice outdoor patio but not 1 TV out there. Bummer.    Walked in, noticed plenty of flat screen TVs and comfy booths around. Pretty empty though for the first football Sunday of the season. Decor is very outdated. Booths are an awful peach/pinkish color.   Stopped at hostess stand so I never made it back to the bar area. My pizza was ready and they brought it out right away. The hostess was friendly. She took my 10% off coupon after she already rang it up and wasn't annoyed that I didn't give it to her earlier.   I was starving so as soon as I got in my car I opened the box to grab a slice and could see it was cold. Took a bite, yep cold. Seemed okay but I hate cold pizza. I had to nuke it when I got home and so it didn't taste how it should. The honey BBQ wings were delish! They were a little on the cold side too, but really yummy. Small in size though. Their menu said they were big. Crispy and yummy sauce.  Next time I order take out I will leave as soon as I place it so I can get it fresh.   Also looking forward to catching a couple NFL games there as they have the Sunday ticket."}
{"text":"I ate here this weekend for my first time... The wings and pizza were GREAT! The atmosphere was great... It was a mixed neighborhood crowd and the people were all friendly.   I'm definitely going to be back soon! Enough said!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good. It has a real pizzeria feel to it. Also seems like a cool bar to hang out at.   I havent had there wings but I heard they are pretty good. So I was going to order some for delivery one night. I tried to order them like I always order my wings, with the hot and bbq sauce mixed together and then tossed on the wings. They told me they couldnt do that. WTF?! Any legitimate place that sells wings will do this. So I asked if they could just put the hot sauce and the bbq on the wings, you dont even have to mix it. They still said no but they could put the bbq sauce on the side.. Haha, so I said, \"you cant just put the bbq sauce on the wings instead of on the side?\" still no, so i said no thanks and hung up.   Kinda ridiculous if you ask me, It might sound like I was being a pain in the ass but i really wasnt asking much of them. I have worked at many restaurants and people order wings like this all the time, its a really simple task to complete.   But the pizza really is good."}
{"text":"Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor."}
{"text":"I called on a Wednesday evening just after 6:30 and ordered a 16\" pizza with fresh garlic and pepperoni and 12 hot wings. The girl that answered the phone was eh. I could definitely tell that she'd rather be anywhere than where she currently was: work.   She said it would be 45-50 minutes. I was pretty excited, based on all the positive reviews, for some really tasty pizza.   Wellllll... 45 minutes came and went. Another 5 minutes went by. My pizza was late. Yes, I'm that person. I understand 5 minutes. 10 is pushing it. 20, you're out of the ball park. And 30?! That's where I fit it. My pizza was 30 minutes late.   BUT! The reason they didn't get a one star is because that pizza was hands down one on of the best pizzas I have ever had. Oh, me. Oh, my. Delicious. The fresh garlic was the perfect touch. If only they had fresh basil as well.   With all that, I will say I will give them another shot, and they owe ot all to the delicious cheesy garlic pizza they delivered to my door (30 minutes late.)   Oh, and the wings? Eh. Nothing special. Standard wings you get anywhere. Hot sauce wasn't so hot."}
{"text":"Great naked wings I suggest the honey hot sauce.  The Redeye beer from Lumberyard is very good and the service was great, owner operated and very nice people.  This place is bike friendly as well"}
{"text":"Fatso's is one of my favorite pizza places - I highly recommend the Pan Big Johnson. Prices are reasonable and on retailmenot.com there is ALWAYS a 15% coupon in circulation (just in case you don't live in the area). Try it - it's unreal!"}
{"text":"Not much beats this place in North Phoenix. Plenty of good beer, good pub food and good company. Great place on a Friday night for live music."}
{"text":"I call this my neighborhood pizza place even though it's 20 miles from my house. My friends and I are frequent visitors and love the casual atmosphere, great beer selection and the awesomely tasty and huge sandwiches. It's definitely a place where \"everyone knows your name\" if you come often enough. Super friendly."}
{"text":"I had almost stopped eating Pizza because it was so difficult to find really good Pizza anywhere in Virginia.  When I relocated to Phoenix and a friend recommended Fatso's I didn't expect to find Pizza I could love again!    The thin crust is perfect, the cheese not too greasy or too salty and the pepperoni is cooked just right for me.  I like it crispy like bacon.  The green peppers are fresh and the sauce tasty.  Can't ask for more than that!    I've eaten in a few times and the service has been sporadic.  My first time the service was fast and attentive, the last time just the opposite.  The waitress seemed to have better things to do.  The times in between were nothing memorable so the service must have been adequate.   The live music is fun and they change musicians enough to allow for conversation in between singers.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the sporadic service."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Not bad, not the best. Kinda pricey... The staff is super friendly, which makes the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly, accommodating, and the pizza and wings are always good.  It is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out."}
{"text":"Have been a regular here for years. Just ordered 48 dollars of food to go. We asked for 2 extra ranch dressing.  The bartender re ran our card for the extra dollar.  Seems awfully cheap.  The pizza and wings are already overpriced.spoke to the owner about the charge and he couldnt care less.  We come here 2 or 3 times a month and spent 50 bucks a pop. Never again . I dont understand why an owner would tell a customer tough shit, I dont care what you think. You dont like it go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza place in North Phoenix. You pay for it, but it's well worth it. They have live music and it has a good \"dive\" feel to it. Absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on two different occasions, and had three items. 1. Wings - GREAT!  So excellent, I ordered them both times. 2. Calzone - gross.  It was a hodgepodge of ingredients and I was extremely disappointed.   3. Pepperoni Pan Pizza - Again, I was disappointed by the quality and taste.    I had such high hopes, but overall I don't think I'll be recommending nor returning."}
{"text":"Was hoping for good pizza but it was average at best. Not a fan and we won't be ordering it again. Delivery was a typical amount of time (30 minutes or so). Sadly not as good as some other pizza chains. Sounds like it's better to dine in."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Fatso's all the time! At first we were hesitant because of the name, but they won us over! It's my favorite local pizza and the servers are like family. We enjoy the live music too. We're fans of the Hawaiian pizza and the Carnivore pizza. Worth checking out..."}
{"text":"Great pizza ! Nice costumer service! I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Some may claim that they have the best pizza in the valley or country, but Fatso's  is where it's at. This is a fantastic independent business that truly cares for it's customers.   The food is delicious and they have a large menu offering far more that their great pie. Fatso's has an extensive selection of international and local beer on tap. Stop by and taste what you have been missing."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer. We thought the pizza was a tad overpriced and extremely greasy.  We ate it all but I would probably stick to the beer and wings in the future. Cute place with some charm and live music though."}
{"text":"Just had another Fatso's pizza .. however, this time we tried the pan pizza style dough .. LOVED the pizza part, but not so much of the crust (the part where there is no ingredient, and its like a bread stick part) ... it was tasteless ... but the overall pizza was fantastic :)"}
{"text":"always great, service pizza and wings. best time to go is when there is live music! Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Fatso's is a neighborhood institution that our family loves to walk to on Friday or Saturday nights. Great music, pizza, and beer; what more could you ask?"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for the family to get great pizza.  They are extremely friendly and attentive here.  We had the thin crust pizza.  It was hot, fresh, and delicious.  It has the atmosphere of a neighborhood bar and grill that is perfect for a family, even one with a few, noisy kids."}
{"text":"Yep...Pizza Time! Two words Great White...try it at Fatsos you can thank me later. From the fun ambiance, good service, Great Pizza and that name, makes this a Top Must Try in Phoenix.   Oh and live music on the weekends if your looking for something to do! Oh and Mrs. Pack man and Centipede arcade games WHAT!   There is only one thing I go to Fatso's for, and that is the Pizza.  My #1 all time fave is the Great White...Mozzarella, cheddar, provolone, olive oil, Italian spices, fresh garlic, and any one topping (no red sauce). \"Ooh Yeah!\"  \"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six.\" Yogi Berra"}
{"text":"We love Fatso's!! Such an awesome hidden gem that we discovered while wandering around one day/ great beer selection, the pizza is awesome, and live music on the weekends. I mean it's great. We never worry about bringing the kids with us because it's family friendly. My daughters asks once a week to go to Fatso's for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! 20 beers on tap! The owners and staff are super friendly. They have been here 20 years...that says something"}
{"text":"We took our two kids here for the first time. It was a nice family atmosphere. Very casual and loud so we didn't have to shush our kids. But, they recieved no crayons etc. It also took a really long time for our server to show. The wings were a bit dry but still tastey. We loved the pizza though. It was delicious! Our only complaint would be the slow service. There seemed to be only one waitress for the entire restaurant! I would go here if I wanted to take my time and socialize. The food was good and the staff was friendly. Our waitressed worked her tail off so I blame management for the slow wait. I'd go again for sure. Maybe just order takeout next time though! (only because I have impatient little ones)"}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant. It's delicious. I crave the thin crust pizza all the time. They use quality ingredients and they cook things just right.  The only thing that I would change is the service.  THE SERVICE IS SLOW AND THE WAITRESSES AND WAITERS ARE NOT FRIENDLY.  Go here for the food it's worth it."}
{"text":"great pizza, family owned place (almost like a Cheers place), friendly staff, lots of tv's ... live music on Fri/Sat nites. Stop on by, you won't be disappointed.  They now have a patio area too for when it gets cooler"}
{"text":"Awesome little find in this area that is bleak for restaurants.  Good food, good beer selection."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in all of Phoenix! I have been eating here since they opened in 1993, and they have NEVER disappointed me. I typically order a thin crust pizza with mushrooms and a dozen hot wings with LOTS of ranch dressing :) Let me break it down for you:  Pizza - The crust is not cracker thin, but it's not doughy. It's basically the perfect crust. The sauce has great garlicy flavor with loads of yummy spices, and the cheese they use is YUMMY! I'm guessing it's provolone?  Wings - I typically order the mild wings, and they still have a kick to them. They are pretty big, nicely crispy, and sauced to perfection :) They are delicious when dunked into their home-made ranch dressing!  They have a full bar, which is really nice for watching football on Sundays. They also have a pool table, live bands on some nights, and open mic night (not my cup of tea, but I thought I'd share it with you). All in all, this place is great, and I will remain a life-long customer :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad thin crust pizza, but definitely on the more expensive side for what you get. We ordered a large pizza w/ 20 wings for pick-up and our total came our to like $32. It was nice to try something new, the food was okay, but not something that I would probably return for."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty terrible. The entertainment is cool though. Kinda seems like the food was an afterthought."}
{"text":"Can't really tell you if the food is good or bad since we couldn't even get our order taken. We were greeted at the door and told where to sit, but then completely ignored by the staff. Bummer."}
{"text":"Food is always great, but the service when you call in is terrible the server #501 cashier guy/bar tender was very rude when I went to pick up my order, saying I didn't order something when I know I did for a fact. No apology just a snarky remark not any rush to get it done since I did have two other items that were ready but now I had to wait for one that \"I didn't ask for\". Please give him a lesson on customer service. I was pleasant but I wish I would of game him a piece of my mind."}
{"text":"Our first time here... didn't really have a good experience, most likely will not be coming back. The server was very nice but the service was VERY slow. Luckily we added pepperoni to our pizza or there would have been no flavor to it. The wings were good but small. The place was very clean. Wouldn't recommend this place unless you're getting pizza for a kids birthday."}
{"text":"We love coming here! The pizza is great, and fair priced. It has a nice mom and pop feel to it and the place is almost always hopping. Easily our favorite pizza joint when you want a comfortable, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"What can I say about Fatso's???? Pizza, great meatball or sausage sandwiches, awesome calzones AND a sports bar feel!! Well sort of. Live music on occasion as well for your pleasure. A great local place!"}
{"text":"We are always on a search for good pizza and we found Fatso's at a strip mall area. The decors had beer signs, golf clubs, and TV all over. Our server was super friendly and nice! She suggested beers and pizza favorites. We shared a thin pizza and wings. The mild wings had a kick to it and was delicious. The thin crust pizza came out nice and hot and was delicious! Crispy, crunchy, and tons of toppings. We will definitely be back because the food and server were great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten several times from Fatso's. The first time I walked in, I had placed an order for pickup, and was impressed with the ambience when I saw the place. The waiter/waitresses are very cheery and warm. The gal working the register told us she loved the place so much, she'd been eating there for fourteen years, and ended up working there! It's a homey bar with cheery low lighting and casual vibes at the bar. I ordered the veggie sandwich, which was AMAZING. Like, moaning while you eat it amazing. I actually had a dream about it last night and woke up hungry.  The only thing I would caution is, don't alter ANYTHING-especially if you are picking up a to go order or having it delivered. I have never had a correct order when I requested any changes-even as simple as \"no cucumbers\" or \"add mustard.\" Also, the veggie sandwich has avocados listed as one of the ingredients, but they do not include it unless you request avo-and then charge extra. So, I jazz up my sandwiches when I get home. The works sandwich and the French dip are also very good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how or why some people give these bad reviews since we've never had anything but a great time.  We live right in the neighborhood and I'm guessing have been here 15 to 20 times. The pizza is great. I love the thickness of the regular (thin-ish) crust, the cheese and sauce are perfect and the dough tastes great too. I always order the pizza well-done and it comes out right every time. They even have a gluten-free crust which isn't bad at all. The wings are well above average too. Maybe most importantly, they have a good selection of craft beers including their house beer (brewed by Lumberjack IIRC) which seems like a hoppy red ale and also have a good selection of IPA's. I'd come here much more often if it wouldn't pile on pounds of fat. Lastly, we've had nothing but great service here every single time.  Love it!"}
{"text":"These guys will take care of you. There was a little communication breakdown during a delivery, and they were proactive with the resolution.  Just a fantastic job of turning a mildly annoying mistake into a positive experience. That's why I'm here writing this review! Oh yeah, real good pizza. Not the best in town, but it is good. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"19 beers in tap, specialty bombers and great pizza.  Also, they have live music and sports."}
{"text":"Good pizza and excellent service.  This place never disappoints.  Great  craft beer selection. I highly recommend the veggie pizza and chef salad. Lots of toppings."}
{"text":"Open mic night so pretty busy.  Have to get our name on a list.  Waiting for them to clear a table and other people walk in and are told to sit anywhere.  REALLY bad customer service.  Wound up walking out to go somewhere else.  Want to go to the neighborhood places, but if this is how they are run, STAY AWAY. Too bad"}
{"text":"A great pizza place in the north phoenix!  Their wings are so amazing I dream about them. The pizza is equally delicious! It is a great place to hang with friends and catch up over a beer (they have a tone on tap) while you treat yourself to some great food!"}
{"text":"Went today with my toddler, had the lunch special (a 9inch cheese pizza) to share, it was ok, a bit reminiscent of a Totinos frozen pizza though.   Service was ok, though when my son threw up after a few bites of the pizza (and right as the server walked by) the server did not even offer more napkins. So that was disappointing.   Previous delivery experiences have been better. Which is the only reason they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"The pizza is well prepared, the atmosphere great. The pizza tastes sweet like someone's family recipe suggested they add sugar. Wow, to pizza? But I don't like pineapple on my ham either. Service was good."}
{"text":"3 stars for their food, 4 stars for their service and beer menu. I enjoy eating here though it is not the tastiest joint in town, the service makes it feel like a good hometown spot."}
{"text":"Pizza is good and you can't beat the beer selection.   Theirs wings have a good sauce also."}
{"text":"You can't beat Fatsos for friendliness and a HUGE selection of salads, pizzas and sandwiches.  The salads are plentiful -- enough for two people and full of delicious fresh produce.   My friend and I were able to catch up over two hours without feeling rushed out the door.  This family owned business has been at this location for decades and is a winner!"}
{"text":"I decided to come back the next afternoon with my peeps and order up another fantastic meal. I am still waiting till that day I get discouraged to stop coming and maybe gonna say I think now is the time because I woke up with a headache and no not from drinking because I don't.... MSG? Gotta wonder what the secret ingredients are though..."}
{"text":"Love this spot, really good food and has a small bar as well!! Live bands make this spot very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This was VERY expensive for the portion size, tea tasted like metal and the pizza was tasteless!! A small Caesar salad for $10?? We expected a much larger serving for that much money, it's fricken lettuce!! Will never return, save your money and eat else where!!!"}
{"text":"I'm never in this neighborhood, but I was seeing a friend's band play at Joe's Grotto across the street and went in here for dinner. We had the Popeye on a thin, whole wheat crust and it may have been the best pizza I've ever had. THe ingredients were fresh, the crust was crispy, and there were no puddles of orange cheese grease on top. I just had my leftover slice for breakfast and it was just as good the next day. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a pint and a pizza!  This place reminds me of the Clover Leaf Tavern back home in Tacoma WA.   So far all the pizza's we've tried have been amazing!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!! Wish I could live next door. Perfect crust, cheesy goodness and if you are anywhere near 32nd and cactus - this is a must stop!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place. They have amazing baked wings. Good pizza with fresh ingredients.   Service is good. If you don't like coffehouse-type music, don't eat in Thurs.-Sun. nights!"}
{"text":"I decided to wait until I had eaten a couple of meals to rate this place. I had some of their sandwiches and two of their thin crust pizzas. Their thin crust is pretty good. Good toppings, thin on the sauce, overall it'll put a smile on your face. Their extra large thin crust will feed 5 adults pretty easily. It has a very relaxed atmosphere. My niece and the children at the other table approved. The bar had a few televisions with different football games on them."}
{"text":"This was a great local hangout. Delicious thin crust pizza (we had the Big Johnson) and inexpensive beer. Tonight they had a fantastic guitar duo. Really fun to hang out and see the locals and watch a game or two."}
{"text":"Even if it is busy, they know how to create an atmosphere that makes you more than okay with waiting maybe a little longer for your pizza and wings. From what I'm aware of they have a live band that comes on the weekend. The pizza and wings are great and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time last night & have to say, I'm impressed! Usually thin crust pizza I reserve for Spinatos - a favorite of mine, but decided to give these guys a try and I'm glad I did. Very flavorful sauce, thin but not \"cracker\" thin pizza with loads of toppings. We got pepperoni and black olive. We also got a Chef salad which was delicious -my other half only complained about \"iceberg lettuce\" but he is a salad snob (loves micro greens). Lastly, their ranch dressing is killer. Not your typical buttermilk like at most places but flavorful. staff was nice & delivery was timely."}
{"text":"We always come here! I love the giant salad. Their ranch dressing is delicious. Their wings are really good as well! They have sports on TV's everywhere, a usual beer drinking, age 40-50 crowd at the bar, and live music on the weekends...classic rock type music from what I've noticed. It's a good laid back family place."}
{"text":"So I thought I would order from my local neighborhood pizza joint for a quick Saturday afternoon lunch. Big mistake! The cheese tasted like rubber, pepperoni was small and crusty, the crust itself tasted like cardboard. I picked it up and the atmosphere seems pretty cool inside, just don't expect good pizza, this was by far the worst I've ever had. We got a large and threw the leftovers out, you know it's bad when that happens."}
{"text":"Why is it pizza joints in the middle of a shopping plaza always taste the best? We've driven past this place for years and always thought it was a great name but didn't stop in for dinner until a random Thursday night for Open Mic night.  My husband and I each had a side salad and we split a large pizza (with food to take home). The pizza was wonderful and so was the service.  My only complaint was the salad dressing was nothing spectacular but other than that, wowzers. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here, had an hour to kill before a concert near by with my daughter.  Great little local pizza place, not overly busy for a Sunday night, football on the TV's, B-day party at the table next to us, local drunks at the bar......  Ordered the Great White pizza with ranch, and it was great. Good selection of beer on tap. I really liked this place, too bad we live 45 miles away.  Our waitress was outstanding!!  I almost got carded!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this side of town and have been excited to try some new restaurants. Lazy Sunday night in and decided to try a new pizza place and we all decided to give FATSO'S a try.  They were extremely polite answering the phone and taking my order. This obviously left me with such high hopes after reading the bio on their website. I for one love small family owned businesses over super corporate. I was told my pizza would be there in 45min. Pretty average time I thought despite being a block away but nonetheless was okay waiting 45min. Little over an hour has gone by and I decided to give them a call back to check on the pizza. They assured me the pizza was already out for delivery and should arrive any min and apologized for the wait. At this point I was still not mad or frustrated Just checking. Another 20 min goes by so if you're doing the math it's been 1 hour and 20 min.  So I decided to give them a call again. (Keep In mind I could have walked there ordered food to go and walked home by now.) Again they answered the phone and were just as confused as I was and assured me my pizza would still arrive. This time i wasn't near as polite. Told them this was the worst first impression and they said it would be free if it didn't arrive in 5 minutes. About 7-8 minutes later the pizza arrived. Only about 45 min late if you're counting. Delivery guy of course apologized for the wait. I asked if the pizza would still be cold. He gave me a shitty look and I told him this would be the last time I ordered through his company.  Just as I suspected the pizza was room temp. Bummer too cause it probably would have been pretty damn good had it been fresh out of the oven. Wings were cold. Didn't have the energy to call back and complain. Just decided there are far far too many good pizza places around to waste my time with theirs again."}
{"text":"I started going there after I moved into the neighborhood. I couldn't help but go back, the brother owners and their wives are just so friendly! The pizza is really good with always fresh ingredients. I love the \"carnivore\" is all the meats! (i'm a guy). The wings are baked, not deep fried and they are delicious. The \"hot\" is really hot so watch out. I usually get the honey BBQ or the terriaki.  They have open mic on Thursdays for the local performers and it's always entertaining. Great music on Fridays and Saturdays.  I go there on Sundays too to watch the games and listen to the regulars cheer on (and complain about) their favorite teams. Fatso's is a great neighborhood gathering place.  Oh! and if you have a charitable event, Bob and Joe will host your group and give to your cause, great guys!  Did I mention how friendly they are?  You should go tonight!"}
{"text":"They actually have pizza crusts as an appetizer on their menu. How cool is that? I mean some people just want the pizza crust and some sauce. Groovy! Two of my fabulous friends met here and are now engaged, so they decided to celebrate where it all began. They are regulars and it shows as the entire party was waited on hand and foot. They have a ton of different pizza options and their salads are big enough to share. Not to shabby if I do say so myself. I will have to come back again soon and try some other options as well as the secret  menu of wings for those that like them extra spicy like me."}
{"text":"I gave it a shot based on the Yelp ratings, but this was just awful pizza.  It was on par with Little Caesars and Eats-a-Pizza.  The crust was hard and overcooked.  The toppings slid right off since it was cooked to death and arrived with the center BOILING hot.  If your a big fan of cheap frozen pizza, I think you'll love Fatso's Pizza because it's totally reminiscent of Red Baron pizzas you'd find for $5 at Walmart.  I'm not going to go deep into what was wrong simply because everything was bad about the darn thing.  I ended up just leaving 75% of it there and paying my bill.  It's not the waitress fault and I tipped her, but only the old standard of 15% because she was no help making our meal any better.  Wouldn't you think she'd offer to take it back, remake it, or offer something better on the menu?  Nope, she just looked at us like this was the first time she'd ever heard their pizza was dog food on a hockey puck and went about her way.  \"Sorry you don't like it\" is all we got from her although she seemed to be a nice lady.  The wings were baked and that's okay as long as I know that going in, and the menu told us so very clearly (I liked that).  Although I definitely prefer fried, these were okay.  They were nothing special since they just seemed to be un-doctored hot sauce and butter.  My issue with them was that they were tiny, teeny, itsy-bitsy, little baby wings.  Seriously, if you're going to charge that much for wings, offer up wings that are at least thicker than the celery sticks.  An average person could eat 2-3 dozen without spoiling dinner.  All in all, I'd have to say this is a great place if you want a local drunks hangout and high school cafeteria food in one convenient location.  I'll not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite food is pizza; Phoenix has the finest selection of pizza selection (I am from the hometown  of LIttle Caesars, not that it should really matter, but helps with the credential to judge pizza - trust me the original Little Caesar's restaurant was simply amazing!).   I have traveled the globe and have even eaten pizza next to the Leaning Tower of PIsa in Italy and must say that Fatso's is my favorite pizza anywhere.  I know New York, Chicago, etc.  Fatso's delivers an amazing deep dish pizza that I usually order for dinner twice a month.  It is divine.  However, they also have pan pizza with most toppings and sizes ranging from personal to 24 plus inches in squares.  I do not know what they do, but they do it right.  In addition, I highly recommend the Caesars salad.    The food her is simply done right.  Throughout the week Fatso's has live music which is always fun.  The service is excellent and the management is friendly.  Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since they opened in the 90's. Pizza still rocks and service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza has the pan deluxe it was amazing will def be coming back!  The aptmosphere  is great small private the staff is so friendly!  The wings are baked not fried, I was scared at first because I love wings but they hit the nail right on the head! Hats off to fat so's!  We will be back"}
{"text":"To say the pizza & wings here is amazing would be an understatement! This place is great. It's small, not fancy, but it's a great atmosphere. They have live music on the weekends, and it can get loud.  The only downside is that the wait staff is a little slow. Since they are so busy, i'm not sure if it's due to lack of staff or just . . well, being busy. The wait staff is wonderful however. Always happy and willing to help you.  Another sad thing is, even though Fatso's delivers, they miss my street (Union Hills) by ONE LIGHT!!! So I will forever have to pick up my delicous food, which is also ok to see their happy faces!"}
{"text":"I'm a Dip is the BEST French Dip ever!! The salads are hit and miss, sometimes they are made quick with a lot of lettuce stems. The pizza is pretty incredible. I don't eat pizza often but when I do it has to be phenomenal, and this place qualifies. This is one of those places I have to stay away from because I will almost always over indulge."}
{"text":"I didn't think I liked thin crust pizza until I ate here.  I didn't think I liked Cheeseburger Pizza until I ate here.  Seriously!  It would be what I recommend to everyone, pizza-wise.  Just try it once, dude!  Onions, cheddar, ground beef & bacon! What's not to love?  I've also tried the Carnivore (meat), & the... I can't remember what it's called, I think the Luau - The Carnivore was ok, but nothing really stand-out regarding toppings, and the hawaiian one? Maybe I was just too excited about it, with onions, ham, pineapple & tomatoes. I wasn't so into it. It tasted light & fresh, but suffered from needing lots of parmesan to salt/flavor it up.  They have tons of fun & interesting sounding pizzas to choose from, so I'm certainly going back to try more.  But I'd also just go back for their wings & salads.  Dang, they make a good chef salad!  Their pink paper menu has this awful, ugly drawing on the front that I must admit, also endears them to me.  Stop by and pick one up, laugh at the cover & the funny pizza names, & then order one!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Most of the reviews were good. I didn't want to order from a chain, so I thought Id try it. Let me say that any chain pizza place has better pizza than fatso's. Any name brand self rising frozen pizza is better as well. This place has lots of beer on tap. Probably to get you can get drunk so you can eat this garbage!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems you wouldn't think to stop at just by looking at it. Its tucked away in a little shopping center and doesn't look like much on the outside but MAN ALIVE the pizza is best I have ever had. Big Johnson special pizza is my go-to every single time. I don't know what they put in it but it is heaven on a slice.  Weekends they have a live band which sets a cool vibe while dining and I really like the desert here as well. Cant go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Yep they really know how to please a costumer of 7 years. Found a bug in the salad was told well we do use fresh produce.  Then told me I will have to talk with manager tomorrow proceeded to hang up. I guess they dont have to eat the crap they serve. Never going back and thanks once again home made food much better. Safer wonder what Maricopa county health department will say about the pictures I took"}
{"text":"What a rip off this place is. I First i'd like to say food is slightly above average, way over priced. I had coupon for a pizza and 20 wings all I asked was for them to do half honey bbq and half hot and they wouldn't budge. I ended up buy 1 medium 1 large and 2 dozen wings it cost 50 dollars. I will settle for Dominos or even red devil, never again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Told 30 minutes for delivery. An hour later I had to call in and ask what happened. Told them to cancel my order. Regardless how busy they can get, that's just poor service."}
{"text":"Great casual place for a beer and some delicious deep dish pizza. Staff was so friendly and it had a small, hometown atmosphere about it. We got a half and half Hawaiian and carnivore pizza. Both yummy and covered in toppings. I definitely feel like a \"fatso\" after eating here. Portions are huge, but so so worth it."}
{"text":"I had really fond memories of a sausage and garlic pizza here years ago. Went back recently to watch some football and tried it again. While not quite as spectacular as I remembered, this is a fine spot for watching football and enjoying dinner. Personal sized pizzas allow everyone to get what they want (versus having nasty peperoni grease make it's way onto my half of the pizza, for example). Nice neighborhood-y spot."}
{"text":"Beer, pizza, sandwiches, and shockingly even salads.  This place hidden in strip mall is amazing. And, don't forget live music nights."}
{"text":"Live music the night we visited, had great pie and cold beer!"}
{"text":"Ok pizza - their pies are square cut and bland.  They use a very simple dough that is soft and flaky, and tastes mostly of flour.  I know some people like this, but it's not really my bag.  Had the cheeburger, cheeburger when we went and toppings didn't liven it up.  I'm not trying to be mean or harsh -- the pizza wasn't bad, just not all that great.  What we did like though was the wings and the atmosphere.  Wings were just the right level of spicy for both myself and the wife (medium) and were crispy and came out nice and hot.  Women's soccer was on and the place was packed.  Lots of tv's and a nice local crowd.  Plenty of beers on tap, and the big cookie with ice cream was worth saving some room for..."}
{"text":"We used to come here with the kids starting in 1996. They are now all grown and moved out so some how we stopped coming here. Last week out of the blue we went back. Same great service, Pizza and wings are still awesome. Great cold beer. We still felt at home, like we always did. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Only had the Chef Salad and while it lived up to the name in portion size, it was boring as all get out. I'm gonna have to try to their pizza on of these days. No lunch special besides the slice of cheese pizza, booooooo.   Really, nothing special. 12 bucks for a salad and an iced tea. Should have went to Picazzo's."}
{"text":"I LOVE pizza, so needless to say I am very particular when it comes to eating at a pizzeria, I was visiting in Phoenix and 2 block away I saw this pizza place so I decided to stop by and try them out  WOW!! what a treat! the pizza is fabbbbbulous, deeeeelicious, yummmmmmy, and the crust is to die for, I had a Pepperoni, mushroom, bell pepper, and GARLIC pizza all I can say is, it's the BEST yet, too bad it is over 300 miles for me to have to go to eat,  If your ever in Phoenix, AZ  please stop by it won't disappoint! the people were very friendly, seems like lots of locals eat here, I've been here a week and I've eaten there 3 times, that should tell you something about the place, plus they have lots of 'Golf' memorabilia all around the place and I love golf, so stop by and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"The meat lovers pizza is awesome! Not necessarily the best New York style pizza what they do a pretty damn good job on their special pies ."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are okay. Nothing special. The wings were pretty good for baked, but aren't going to win any awards.   Best thing about the pizza is the sauce, which is on slightly on the sweet side, making this better than the typical non-Chicago pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best baked wings! Their pizzas are unique and delicious.  My boyfriend has to stay away from gluten and he loves their gluten-free crust.  Don't even get me started on that cookie dessert yum!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood pizza joint. I'm here at least once a week...usually twice. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel welcome.   I've tried several items but my top choices would be the Great White Pizza (no red sauce, loads of garlic), Caesar salad and the Gus Sandwich (similar to a french dip but with fresh jalapenos added).  They offer live music Fri and Sat nights and Thursday is open mic night. All in all a great place to grab a beer (they have 20 on tap and a few that rotate monthly), have some pizza and relax."}
{"text":"Clearly, they're doing something right, because I was back within a week. This time got a Great White with mushrooms. Of note, the white pie (duh) doesn't have the red sauce of which I was so fond, so I got to experience a whole different side of Fatso's. I just have to say, I'm hooked. This place has a completely unique taste and I love it. Strongly recommend the Great White. I'm craving it now, but I'm going to be the size of a house if I eat here as often as I want to."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage and garlic is one of my favorite pies in all of Phoenix.  So good and so addicting!  I pretty much stick with that when eating at Fatso's.  I tried their wings and the Big Johnson specialty pizza.  Wasn't really a fan of either, but I'm telling you, you won't go wrong with a thin crust with pepperoni, sausage, and garlic pizza.  It's INSAAAAAAAAAAAANELY good!!!  Dip the sucker in some ranch, and you got yourself a deliciously, decadent and gluttonous meal. Damn, that's some good $#*%!"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad!!!!!  I am not a person to complain, or really write reviews for that matter, but this place was awful!  The service was horrible.  The bartender was the only server and he basically ignored us the entire time and was laughing it up with the regulars at the bar.  I could have over-looked that.  But the food!!  OMG!  The pizza was most definitely either microwaved or frozen.  The crust was literally like cardboard, the cheese was rubbery and over-cooked.  Just not good at all.  When asked how everything was, the server walked away before we could answer.  He was arrogant and, quite frankly, rude.  The place is also very tacky.  There are towels hung up all over the walls.  It's like one big dust magnet.  I will never return!"}
{"text":"No doubt about it, it is confirmed that they have this amazing big and delicious Pizza's. There are people that usually don't like the idea of eating pizzas in the evening there are also a group of people like us who wants to eat pizzas all day long. Although it's not healthy, but who cares, we eat what we want. Thank you Fatso's Pizza for the amazing pizza. You did a great work on it that's why it's very delicious. I love the fact that its supersize and it has this nice and delicious unique taste. Very addictive."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from this place for 17 years and it was the most amazing pizza, but the last 2 I have got from there made a frozen pizza taste good. Both were luke warm  and barely edible. I don't know if it was sold or new mangement. Never again. I hope they go out of business so someone that knows how to run a business moves in."}
{"text":"Our advice is spend your money elsewhere. We ordered pizza crust but when it came out it was literally cardboard. We actually sent it back. When the pizza came out it tasted bland. We expected crispy crust and instead got soggy crust. Service was good! They even gave us an 3rd refill even though the menu said no refills."}
{"text":"I almost always get this food as take-out, because I know the service is notoriously slow and unfriendly.  That being said, the pepperoni pan pizza is something I get on a weekly basis.  I'm addicted.  Their salads are HUGE so I usually get a jumbo garden salad along with it.  The only downside to this weekly craving I have is the price.  Fatso's is not inexpensive.  If you want a \"deal,\" then hit up Domino's or Little Caeser's.  But if you want good, quality food, Fatso's is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"When my wife and I were there, we both agreed on how to gauge this place.   This is where you bring your kids to have sit down pizza. It is a step up from Peter Piper...okay thats not nice of me to say, it is a big step up from PP, BUT it is no Spinatos by any means.   This has a great local bar feel over on the bar side, but it is far enough where you could bring your children and not worry about the belligerent drunk giving your kids new vocabulary words to try out at school.   The pizza like i was saying is the type to serve to your kids...It is a little bit more pricey than i would prefer, but definitely isn't super greasy like other places.   i might bump them up to 3 stars if I ever visit the bar and it's fun, but i can't see more than a three."}
{"text":"Where everybody knows your name.  Great food, awesome beer selection and owners that make a point of remembering your name when you come in."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have had in a long time.  Ordered the so called deep dish.  If you like thick doughy crust with absolutely no toppings you may be thrilled.  It was terrible.   All you get is undercooked crust.  What a waste of $21 bucks."}
{"text":"The food is ok, not great. We had the deluxe pizza and medium dozen wings. I had the honey brown beer for $3; reasonable drink price. My only complaint is that they charge for extra ranch. I understand that restaurants sometimes practice this for take out orders, but charging for ranch at a dine in transaction makes the restaurant appear to be cheap/penny pinching. If they are hurting for money to where they need your charge for extra ranch, when a small portion is given to start with, perhaps they should bake the cost of the $ .50 ranch in the price of their pizza/wings.   Another issue is that were were not told that there was a charge for the extra ranch. If we would have been told, were would have just laughed at the fact that they were being cheap, and still ordered it. But we only discovered the charge when we were given the bill. When I asked the waitress about the charge she said, \"Yea we charge here, we make it homemade\". I told her that she did not provide us with that information when we asked for it, nor was the extra charge stated on the menu. She replied, \"Yea, we charge for it.\"   Yes, it's just a $.50 charge, but the way it was communicated, and handled was off. And the ranch was runny; nothing special."}
{"text":"Let me explain my 4 stars...The pizza is mediocre at best. But what makes this place is the simple atmosphere, beer on tap, and local vibe.  Not a fancy place at all, but that turns out to be a good thing for this establishment. This is the place to come for a game, or fun night and you can be ensured that the service is decent despite the number of patrons versus servers. We came on a Monday football night and only 2 people were working. We never felt neglected. The food was decent and I would come back just for the comfortable atmosphere. I normally don't give 4 stars to restaurants that aren't food worthy, but the family that runs this is so friendly that you can't help but love it. Thank you for making our experience seemingly to be catered to us (you changed the tv to our station). Is this a foodie destination? Perhaps not, but it is most definitely a neighborhood joint that everyone must go to. The atmosphere and people are the crux of this place. I have found a new fun place to visit where I feel welcome at any time."}
{"text":"I can really see why people don't like this place.  Let me suggest a paradigm adjustment.  Don't think of Fatso's as a pizzeria.  You'll only be disappointed.  Instead, think of it as a bar with really cheap pizza. I say this because Fatso's has a fantastic beer selection for a little neighborhood place (biased; it's my neighborhood).  They have some of Oregon's finest combined with the Southwest's finest, and that is some damn fine beer.  You're not very likely to find places around here with a similarly diverse + good menu of choices.  It's a great environment - very homey - with live music on a regular basis.  I can't speak as to the quality of the music, but I'm optimistic.  The owners are nice and friendly and treat you like a neighbor should. But then we come to the pizza.  And I have to admit I've only tried the pizza, and not any of their other offerings.  The pizza is just not that great.  In particular, I dislike the sauce.  I feel that it doesn't do any justice to anybody, and that it probably comes out of a can.  The crust could be okay, but I think it gets brought down by the sauce, and, eh, I dunno, I'm just usually not a fan of really thin-crust pizza unless it has other things going for it.  'Fresh' isn't a word I would use. But it is REALLY cheap.  It is cheap as hell.  So if you come here to drink with your friends, and happen to incidentally buy food, then Fatso's likely rates as a 4-star drinking establishment.  Maybe 4.5 if the music is good."}
{"text":"Awesome place to relax and have a beer and some food.  Lots of screens to watch sports and lots of beer choices to choose from on tap.  The guys that run this place are great they always say hello and are always friendly and cheerful.  I have never had a single problem here at all.  I go here often and will continue."}
{"text":"Good Lord does Fatso's have the BEST pizza around. No seriously, it's the bees knees! I just moved back from California and you best believe this was my 1st pizza stop!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Fatso's is tucked away in a little shopping plaza next to a Planned Parenthood.  It's a neighborhood favorite, but other than the people that live right by, not that many people seem to know about it.   The pizza is really good, but the salad is excellent.  The sandwiches are tasty and humungous and the beer is pretty cheap.   The restaurant itself is nothing fancy- it's filled with your normal tables, booths and bar- it's just a casual pizza joint that serves up some really delicious food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you hate to tell anyone about and want to keep all to yourself. That wouldn't be very nice though would it. I can't find a single fault with their pizza. The sauce is perfect with just a hint of sweet the dough is like really good New York (they have a Chicago deep dish style to, looks fabulous but I haven't tried it.) They use good quality cheese and toppings and aren't skimpy with it. Just as a bonus a nice beer garden, full bar, live music on the weekends and an incredibly friendly staff. This is all hidden away in a strip center that you almost have to search out.. So search it out. The large pizza is huge, it's a guaranty of pizza the next day if 2 people order it. Try the pizza cookie for dessert.. Big warm fresh out of the oven cookie topped with ice cream.. What's not to like about that."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizzas to go yet we did wait in the bad area for a bit having a beer. Although we weren't there long I noticed it has a great neighborhood vibe to it. I like how the bar area is somewhat separate from the main dining area yet you're not completely cut off from the tvs in the bar.   Service was quick and friendly and the staff was all decked out in Christmas wear.   The pizza was great, especially if your a thin crust fan. The XL doesn't mess around size wise!  Can't wait to come back to stay longer!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, consistent, good service and so CLEAN!! Friendly staff and patrons - Good music and it didn't drown out the conversation. I was surprised at how good the pizza was - but a friend from back East recommended it - which is saying a LOT! Bring the family or come as a couple - either way they make your seating work for you. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I like independent pizza stores, however these gentlemen need to step up the game. I want really hungry so I got a small pizza, and it was too loud so it was a take out. I got 4 small slices with cheese and oil dripping out of it. I was already in road when I saw oil dripping through the box on leather passenger sit.   I eventually got rid off the stain with carpool passengers and smell with  fabreze. But you guys need to work on your pizza without oil and quality package. Step it up!"}
{"text":"When we want some good cheap pizza and beer, we go to Fatso's.  Very casual, neighborhood bar/pizza joint atmosphere. Live music on weekends. Love the Cheezy Wheezy and Carnivore pizzas!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in arizona  I eat there every time  I'm in town.Great owners  Make you fill at home"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and good pizza.  Appetizers leave something to be desired but the good service and live music make it worth coming back."}
{"text":"This is my new pizza hang out and take out joint.  I really like it.  It is a total neighborhood bar and pizza place.  I've had the salads, pizza and wings -- all were really good and at a good price.  I am looking forward to trying the sandwiches.  They look really good.  It's casual, easy going and the bar looks like it can get pretty neighborhoody fun."}
{"text":"Fatso's is great!  It is a small pizza joint, and while it isn't fancy or glamorous by any stretch of the imagination, it is the perfect place to grab some wings, pizza and beer.    We live close by and come to Fatso's often.  There are several things that keep us coming back.  The Gus....so simple, yet so delicious.  The perfectly crusty bread loaded with sharp cheddar, lean roast beef and fresh jalapenos is undeniably one of favorite sandwiches of all time (check it out Nader!).  Their honey barbecue wings are awesome.  The sauce is made in-house and it is remarkable.  Think sweet, smokey barbecue with a spicy kick.  The wings are baked, an added bonus for me.  The thin crust pizza is good, but don't go in expecting a New York Style pie.  Add fresh garlic to your pizza of choice and you will never want to eat a garlic-less pizza again!  Fatso's has a surprisingly large selection of beers on tap and a number of bottled craft beers (Stone, Rogue, etc.).    Lastly, treat yourself to a Fat Cookie.  It is100% worth the thousands of crunches you'll need to do to work it off!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for more from this pizza place. There isn't much to say, it just wasn't good. If you want a standard, flavorless pizza then fatso's would be fine.   Personally, I like dominos more. I was hoping for more, because I wanted to find a great pizza place (big chain pizza places are overrated because of their convenience)."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Guinness, great pizza, doesn't get any better than that. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The four is for fun, casual atmosphere and wait staff, not really the food.  The wings were good, but seemed pricey (8.50 for twelve!!!) (they don't have mild), but the pizza was very ordinary.  But, we only ordered thin crust cheese as we had non adventureous people with us.  Barros is FAR better for pizza.   We'd go back to Fatsos as we really liked the Thursday Open Mic night and the general low key atmosphere, but likely wouldn't order pizza again- medium pizza for 11+ bucks was really no better than a 5.00 Little Ceasars- they cut it like a checkerboard (might cut in wedges if you asked).  The wait staff was great... not at all slow as in other reviews.  If you are looking for REALLY good food, this isn't your place, but if you are looking for average 'bar' type food, nice people, very low key atmosphere and some live hipster music, this is your place."}
{"text":"Always stop by when im in the area.  Great pizza and sandwiches.  Super cold beer..great draft selection..friendly fast staff ....wings are baked not fried..super good flavor... cool lil spot fir a quick beer ir a big dinner...good prices too...even have pacman and centipede lol"}
{"text":"Average food, VERY limited delivery area, and abrupt customer service.  Very meh."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Live music on the weekends (Friday and Sat. nights only, I think). Always a lot of people, but I've never waited for a table. Excellent service. The only pitfall is that there aren't a lot of food choices outside of pizza. A few calzones and sandwiches and very basic salads, but not much else. Still, it's called Fatso's PIZZA - so if you want pizza, check it out!"}
{"text":"We love this place and always order the same thing.  House salad with ranch, wings (dry with honey hot sauce and ranch on the side) and a deluxe pan pizza.  By the time we get to the pan pizza, we are only able to manage 1 slice each and take the rest home.  The food is consistently good and the service is great.  Some nights they have karaoke night so it can get a bit loud.  But if it's bothersome, then take your food to-go.  Thankfully this place is just around the corner from our house.  We are definitely repeat customers."}
