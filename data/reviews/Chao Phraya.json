{"text":"Food was excellent... authentic thai food! I strongly recommend the crab claw appetizer. Service is great and the ambiance is cool."}
{"text":"Meilleur resto thaïlandais je j'ai essayée. Le décor est chic et agréable, le service parfait, et la nourriture délicieuse! Je reviendrais avec plaisir!"}
{"text":"Like it here! It was very pricey to me though. I went here for a friends birthday and my bill was 50$. I ordered the eggplant chicken with steamed rice. My friends and I got appetizers to share and split the cost and my bill was still very expensive. I really did like my main meal though. I found it very savoury and authentic. The peanut butter dumplings were yummy."}

{"text":"We went here on Mother's day. We were really disappointed. We had to wait for more than two hours for our food. A lot of people around our table had the same problem and they started to leave without their food after waiting for too long. When we wanted to leave, the cashier could not even produce the bill with our order modified. While we were waiting to have  our bill produced, the foods arrived. It was a total disappointment!!! First, the cook did not bother to chop up the vegetables in the fried rice. They left big piece of broccoli in the place. The Pad Thai taste was bad. It was supposed to be sweet, sour and spicy. However, the only taste it had was overwhelmingly sour. In addition, Pad Thai is always served with chopped peanut and lemon. We had none of those. The plates were plain with no decoration. I did expect better quality of food and service at the price charged. In summary, the restaurant decoration and ambiance is nice. The quality of food is at more or less the same as Thai express, a mainly take out chain of restaurant. The service was very ordinary. They are way overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely excellent. Probably the best Thai food I've ever had, and well worth the prices which do seem slightly elevated compared to peers. But it's worth a trip and worth the price. Their kow pad poo (crab fried rice) is about as spicy as I can handle food without it being too spicy. The curries are much milder but extremely flavorful. And their pad see euw is almost like vermicelli noodles instead of the wide noodles I'm used to, but is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I'm confused about this place...

Have not been here in ten years. The place looks nice and all but the price is out of whack with regular thai food. 

Anyhow, I do find the decor nice, and the service was very good and efficient just that the food is kind of blah. And yet when you have and listing of 5 best thai resto in MTL, this place is always on it...

My problem with this place is that everything tastes too sweet. When you go to and asian restaurant and the food is too sweet, you know something is up... this s*%!t ain't for real right?

Thai food and everything at once, sweet salty spicy sour hot cold crispy bitter so on and so forth... all in varying combinations. Here we have some semblance of sour, or salt or crispy but it always ends with sweet. It's very one note. 

After two appetizer and two mains, I had had 3 water and one drink that I ordered. If this is what's best in MTL, we are lacking in Thai food. 

I really want good hoi tod!!! goddamnit!"}
{"text":"Good selection of items on the menu. Two of us shared the panang beef and the battered shrimp in chili sauce. Both were delicious, especially the shrimp, which were very lightly battered to add just a little crunch to the dish."}
{"text":"Repas plus qu'ordinaire et service à l'avenant. Les plats aux saveurs typiquement fraîches et explosives étaient fades (même ceux marqués de 3 piments), tièdes et tristes. Accompagnés de carottes rapées et de persil fatigué, aucun n'avait de relief particulier. On nous a apporté le café avant le dessert, le serveur ayant à l'évidence oublié notre commande... et le restaurant était presque vide. J'avais l'habitude de fréquenter ce restaurant quand l'envie de manger de la bonne cuisine thaïlandaise me prenait... Plus jamais."}
{"text":"Love the peanut sauce and the tom yum with coconut milk"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a flight into Montreal. I was famished so my friend recommended that we go to this Thai restaurant. The ambiance is nice, but not quite like Thailand. Actually, I am not sure cause I never visited Thailand before. We sat down and ordered a couple of appetizers. I recommend the dumplings  with peanut sauce. It was delicious, but eat it while it is hot otherwise it does not taste as good. We shared 3 entrees and they were good, but nothing that I would recommend as a must eat. One thing that did peak my interest was the fried spinach. I have never had that before, and decided to try that. It was light and crispy, but it was too much to handle cause the portion size was huge. The service was prompt and good. A good place to go to hang out with some friends for a nice dinner (or a date place)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!

Came here for supper and my mouth and I left very satisfied!

We were 3 and not overly hungry but we all like a variety of things to nibble on so we shared a few dishes. A spicy squid with chili and sweet basil, a seafood medley of crab claws, shrimp scallop and white fish in a curry coconut broth, jumbo shrimp with garlic, pepper and basil, spicy eggplant and pad Thai.

I'm not a fan of pad Thai so I didn't have more then a bite of it but the rest of our meal was truly delicious. The shrimp was heavenly, sweet buttery, roasted garlic with basil that I will definitely be ordering again. The squid was fiery hot that kept building in intensity but I wouldn't have had it less spicy, truly perfect. The eggplant was tasty but I will try somethjng else in terms of vegetable next time and the seafood medley was amazing. The coconut curry broth was the perfect balance of sweet and curried, nice sized scallops, crabs claws, chunks of white fish and shrimp.

We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal and were stuffed but decided to share the mango on coconut rice for dessert. The rice could have been soaked in more coconut cream for my taste but the mango was smooth, ripe and succulent!

Loved this place, I will be coming again soon!"}
{"text":"Our experience with Chao Phraya, food wise, was spectacular. But overall, we were a little befuddled with their service. 

Our appetizer was served very quickly. We had as much as we wanted as quickly as we could since we were ravenous, and wanted to get on to the next course. After that, we waited for 45 minutes for our entrees to be brought to us. At the 40 minute mark, I asked our server if there was a problem with our order, since we hadn't received it yet, to which they expressed surprise since they thought we were still working on the appetizer (there were two spoons of it left). 

While we were waiting all that time, we kept drinking water to silence our grumbling stomachs. Our wait staff kept forgetting that our water had no ice in it - whenever they would come over to refill the barely sipped glass, they would top off our warm waters with ice, and after we reminded them about the no ice, they would go change the glass. This happened almost 11 times (I counted). 

After we licked the plates clean and FINISHED our entrees, we kept waiting for the staff to turn up for desert order, but no one did. Finally at the 15 minute mark, I had to climb down the upper level where we were seated, find our server, and request him to bring the desert that we wanted. Very weird. The staff was polite and apologetic, but since they did the same thing twice, I have a feeling that they did not understand the problem at all. 

Again, the food was really really reallly good. Maybe the staff was jsut having a bad day?"}
{"text":"Super Good Thai restaurant. There is .a lot of flavor in their meals. The service was marvelous!  I took Chicken dumplings with peanuts sauce plus a good Green curry meal with basilic ! Miiiiiam!"}
{"text":"I'd give this resto 2.5 stars, but in this case I have to round down. There were two major disappointments with our dinner: one was the price. It was very expensive for Thai cuisine, for example a tiny portion if sticky rice was $6. My second issue was the quality of the meat that they used. We ordered a sweat and sour fish and a pad Thai with duck. In both cases the meat was dry, rubbery and not too tasty. It really seemed like a quality of meat that you would find in the frozen food section of Super C. Given the aforementioned priciness of the dishes this surely is in appropriate.  

We also ordered a tofu with crispy spinach and peanut butter sauce which was good. In all cases the vegetable, noodles and tofu component of the dishes were good. 

With so many Thai options in the city I see no reason to splurge at Chayo Phara as there is better Thai food to be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"New place for this New Yorker. Server will ask you how spicy you like your meal.There is also a scale of chili peppers next to each menu item. I ordered won Ton soup and heat was perfect for a cold Montreal Night. For Main course I had chicken with Cashew Nuts which was so delectable that I finished it. Becoming a fan of Thai Food, healthier and lighter them Chinese Food. Bravo Staff!!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel this place at all. 

Let's start with the good news: the service was quite good. Nice service all around. Warm, friendly. You usually expect this from a Thai restaurant and they delivered on this very well.

Now onto the less stellar aspects.. the food is bland. When I go eat Thai food I expect - and really want - to be slapped  in the face with a giant hammer of flavor. I need to feel the pain! The spices! The flavor assaulting my very core from every angle. Not so much here... Very bland flavors that left me without any sort of teary eyes, runny nose or deep satisfaction when delicate balance meets raw power - which is usually the staple of great Thai food. The dishes should punch your guts in but gently, and politely. It usually brings along friends to accompany the spiciness. Here I got a long highway paved with pillows and elevator music.

Blandness.

No depth, no balance, not enough flavors. Yea you feel spiciness but that is never enough on its own.

We had 5 dishes and they ranged from being just weirdly put together like their cucumber salad with a sweet cough-like-syrup to being OK like their tofu with red curry. The spring rolls were under-seasoned which to me takes out a few stars right from the get go. The sauce was quite poorly made - I could do better and I am terrible in the kitchen. You simply cannot serve food at your restaurant like that.

Sorry for the lack of detailed description but my meal there is a long lost memory of mine and Chao Phraya has been put in my \"never go back there\" stash. It's not terrible but when there are dozens of other choices out there, why even bother?

The people working there seem really nice, honest people. i would suggest to consider changing some of their kitchen staff.

Vegetarian food: 2 un-Thai-like stars out of 5
Service: 4.25 out of 5
Value: 2.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"I went here a long time ago and it sticks out in my mind as a heavenly experience. The service was fantastic, the restaurant was beautiful, and the food was beyond delectable. I had a fish dish that was possibly the softest, most succulent piece of fish ever. 

Definitely a restaurant for a special night out."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai in town!! I used to like it more back then when it was the old owners..I found the food was more tasty! Anyhow, it is still good. 

I love their chicken wings with spinach leaves. They are one of my favorite. Love the duck, one of their specialty! The peanut chicken is not bad also! I love their tom yum soup, one of the best in town.

Prices are very reasonable! Service is good. This place gets crowded on the weekend so don't forget to reserve!"}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot after my friend made me wait hours to eat and it seemed like every single restaurant in Montreal except Subway was closed until 5pm. I had Pad Se Ew and it was among the best I've ever had. Pricey as hell. But worth it."}
{"text":"Chao Phraya was a nice neighborhood find. We just stumbled upon it and were glad we did. The space has a upscale feel--good for a special evening out. The food was delicious. I had a vegetarian dish with the right amount of spice for me (moderate). My daughter enjoyed the pad Thai. The food is traditional and you get what you expect. The ingredients were fresh and the veggies nicely cooked (not overcooked). Service was great!"}
{"text":"We started a family tradition a few years ago called \"restaurants of the world\" where every few months we pick a different country and eat out at a restaurant featuring that country's cuisine.  We got off track for a while with the arrival of Baby, but picked up where we left off with Thailand.  

I find Chao Phraya to be one of the nicer Thai places in Montreal.  Warm decor, on a pretty part of Laurier Ave.  We were greeted warmly at the door by a gentleman, either the owner or manager, always a classy touch. 

We were four people and ordered five plates to share, plus rice, which was more than enough.  A chicken curry was very flavourful but a bit lacking in heat, despite the \"two chilli\" warning sign on the menu.  Very good pad Thai, tasty veggies in peanut sauce, and a really great chicken dish with onions and ginger.  The only disappointment was the garlic shrimp.  The flavour was good, but the shrimp were very over cooked to the point of being rubbery.  Prices are a little on the high side compared to similar places, due in part to good quality ingredients and an upscale neighbourhood.

Service was good, not particularly outstanding but no complaints."}
{"text":"How you say YUM in Taiwanese? The food was very tasty, very flavourful and the ingredients  were very fresh.  A great selection of different varieties of main dishes and appetizers.  I loved that you could actually buy a half bottle of wine with dinner at a very reasonable price!  

The staff was very friendly and attentive and the pace of the meal was very relaxed and well timed.  The restaurant is located in the Plateau area of Montreal and even though it was a bit off the main strip, the place was busy the whole night.  

My only complaint that I would have to mention is that they charged you for parking in what looked like a auto repair shop that was closed for the night that was right across the street from the restaurant.  I figured that if you're spending what I thought was a decent amount of money for dinner, that even if they were being charged by the business, that they could spring for parking to make the experience 5 star worthy.  

I'd still go back but might spend the extra minute or so to find a parking spot on the street."}
{"text":"Amaazzzinggg Thai food. I've been here twice and both times I was very satisfied in terms of service and quality of food. The first time I came with my visiting sister and mother and we ordered pad thai, green and red curry. It was served in a perfect portion, not too much and not too little. The curry wasn't so spicy but it was so rich in flavor! The coconut milk was just right and didn't overpower the rest of the dish. The presentation was great too, the curries were served in a medium sized blue and white porcelain (i think) bowl. They decor of the place was beautiful too, you feel like you're in Thailand or something close to it. Ok I might be exaggerating, but basically the place has a wonderful ambiance. The second time I went i ordered a duck dish and it was so tender yet crispy, I LOVED it. I also ordered a great lemongrass soup. Very rich in taste. This place gets busy so I suggest to reserve. Probably the best Thai restaurant I've had so far."}
{"text":"We went here on our first night in Montreal. I love Thai food and this spot did not disappoint! The prices are higher than your normal neighborhood hole in the wall. But the quality of food matches the prices. Really good flavors. We had a curry and a noodle dish and both were delightful. Recommend."}
{"text":"I went here with an old girlfriend a while ago and I will always remember the food, and the ambiance. It is a great date place, the service makes you look smooth as heck and the food is romantic in style and flavour. No messy plates or warm food that should be hot or cold salad that got caught under a hot lamp. We had the crab claw cakes with sweet chili sauce and wonton soup. Flavour profile was there without tasting like a typical asian style soy based soup. The meal was great if I remember correct my girlfriend had the peanut butter chicken and fried spinach and I had the vermicelli with beef skewers and sauce. All food was hot and had chopped peanuts to make it salty and crunchy, added with some fresh cilantro and coconut flavor --- yeah it was a great night."}
{"text":"This is hands-down, the best Thai food I've had in Montreal! The decor is elegant, but effortless. The service is wonderful and warm without being over the top. It's certainly not cheap, but it's not overpriced either. This institution has clearly been around for some time, but they manage to keep the restaurante feeling exciting, fresh and interesting! If you go, try the duck Pad Thai! Mmmmm :) As other folks have said, the green curry dishes are also very good."}
{"text":"Chao Phraya is a nice place with white table cloths and welcoming as well. We arrived here around 7 and were immediately seated. My boyfriend and I were quite famished and decided to quickly place our orders for Thai Iced Tea and the Imperial Rolls once we sat down. To our surprise, they didn't have Thai Iced Tea.  We opted for the iced waters and began our meal with the rolls.  We also ordered the Pad Thai with duck and the Spicy Beef with Basil. The entrees were delicious, but the Imperial Rolls were horrible. They were bland and filled with vegetables that just didn't seem to be fresh. Nonetheless, our entrees outshined the appetizer and service was great."}
{"text":"Bon, frais et  authentique. 
C'est de la bonne cuisine thai. Tenu par des thaïlandais ( c'est important :D)"}
{"text":"Reportedly the best Thai in town. I had high hopes after reading up on the restaurant and they delivered a nice meal, but the best Thai food I've had, it was not. 

Open only for dinner service, reservations are highly recommended, but if you go later in the evening finding a table should be easy.  The interior is all very nice and worthy of bringing a date, but the staff seemed young and poorly trained.

Portion sizes were a tad small so factor that in when ordering. The lack of Green Papaya Salad on the menu was the first hint that things were amiss.  Everybody seems to rave over their peanut sauce, but I was unimpressed, I guess warm peanut butter with loads of sugar just isn't my thing. The red chicken curry was the highlight of the night and I enjoyed drizzling the curry over my rice, I just wish it was a bit spicier. To end the meal, we had the Pad Thai that was so sweet it was almost inedible, apparently sugar is the chef's secret ingredient.

Without drinks our bill came to about $35 a head after tips and taxes. A classy Thai place with mediocre food at OK prices.  The hunt for a great Thai restaurant continues."}
{"text":"I came here twice and the food is very nice (try the dessert too!) and the service is too! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Classy but casual, tasteful wood and art that's just fine, not trying too hard, full of Montrealers, sun as it sets, friendly accommodating service all carrying around strollers for you, seating last minute guests without a reservation, and smiling gently making everyone feel calm and comfortable. The little things: hot plates delivered right before the mains are served, drink orders remembered and duplicated with ease, and yah. Delicious food. Everything is clearly homemade, the unique kick to the peanut sauce attests to it and makes me want to eat it with all dishes, every meal, for all time or at least a week. I love this section of Laurier for it's cute shops and bars and restaurants and overall feeling of a small, slow French town, and I hugely recommend Chao Phraya."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there for Thai food because of the excellent review on yelp. 
The ambience was really good with good decor. The service was great too, very friendly and lots of smiles. 
Lastly the food. I like the food there. We ordered the mango salad with lobster, tom yum soup with fish, seafood with eggplant and red curry with beef. 
The green mango was refreshing, but the lobster does not taste too fresh. 
The other three dishes are great, good taste, but VERY small portion, and WAY OVERPRICED! You are paying $10 for a small bowl of soup, for an example. 
Also we waited for very long between dishes even through there were very few customers in the restaurant.
We also ordered sticky rice with mango for dessert. 
I would recommend going there with the expectation that you will get small portion for lots of money. 
Overall, good food"}
{"text":"This was our first meal when we arrived in Montreal, and it really warmed us up from January's winter chill. Don't come here expecting cheap eats, though. It's one of the nicer Thai places I've been to, and a favorite of our local friends. We had a large party, which the staff were able to accommodate in the mezzanine level of the restaurant.

We ordered a variety of appetizers and dishes to share family style. Everything was rather flavorful, although the portions are not as large as you might usually expect. The chicken/gai satay, green curry with duck, and mango sticky rice were some favorites.

The place was packed for a Friday night dinner, so a reservation is a must, especially for larger parties."}
{"text":"I've known this restaurant for over 10 years now, I just do not go often because it is quite a drive from my place, and a little pricey for thai food, but it is good !

I went back tonight for my bday dinner. You can reserve on OpenTable, but only for 6 people (max) so I called them to change it to 15 and they cancelled my Open Table (oh well). We were well greeted and were seated in the back, and since we were the only group in the back we had privacy, which was great ! 

I really enjoy their papaya salad (you can ask for the shrimp powder on the side if you're not too sure you'll like it) and their pad thai !! It's well spiced, and you can ask for citrus (they don't serve it automatically but have it). I also really used to enjoy their tom yum, in my mind at least, but tonight was a bit disappointed to it, it's not as tasty as I remember it. 

Service was really good and we did not wait that long for food. Everyone on my table enjoyed their meal !!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I need less than a \"trendy\" restaurant in a city where men in capri pants are \"trendy.\"  Chao Phraya is full to the brim with these \"bon vivants\" and with a lot of American people whose want of nightclubs has rocketed them north of the border.  If you walk into a restaurant and see a man with an open collared shirt marshaling the distribution of shots in tiny porcelain cups, it's not a great sign.

The food leaves something to be desired, as well.  A mango salad (I can't be troubled to navigate CP's monstrosity of a Flash website for translation) was fair.  A small seafood soup was by far the best thing we had, with a good, fresh prawn and a decent crab leg.  The broth was as we requested, swimming with chiles.

Vegetarian entrees were nothing to write home about.  The service was nice and friendly and the prices were semi-reasonable."}
{"text":"As an avid foodie, I've been to at least hundreds of restaurants in my life. This was the by far the worst restaurant experience of my life. After a two hour wait, the food finally came. The plates were carelessly decorated and was very subpar. You can get a better meal at Thai Express minus the wait and the high end price. There was clearly a lack of service and the restaurant was evidently understaffed. I usually never leave negative reviews, however this restaurant experience stands out as one of the worst. Our table was not the only one to experience this as there were many disgruntled clients who completely cancelled their orders due to the wait. Would not recommend, not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Montréal. The place was completely full but the service was impeccable. The dishes were well done. Pad Thai and coconut curry was by far the best choices."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The waiter encourages you to order more than a plate each so you can share just like they do in Thailand, but at 25$+ a plate, I'd rather not. The flavours were too overwhelming and didn't blend well together, it was either too sweet (ex. the peanut butter sauce) or too salty or bland (ex. the pad thai). We just wanted to eat authentic Thai cuisine not the kind you make to please westerners tastebuds. I gave it two stars because of the nice staff and their service and the place looks neat as well."}
{"text":"I can't offer any comments regarding ambiance or decor etc as I have not physically been on location. I ordered delivery from Chao Phraya and was pretty disappointed :( I had such high expectations for their shrimp Pad Thai and peanut butter dumplings but both fell short.  They were both sort of just ordinary-with not a lot of flavour/texture , not bad but not memorable especially when I consider the price-which is not horrible but at the same time I've had way better pad thai and dumplings for cheaper. That being said, the delivery was pretty quick and the delivery person was friendly. All in all this was not a horrible experience by any means but I can safely say this wouldn't be my first choice for the next time. Perhaps this was simply one of those times when the food is better in person. Based on the good reviews this place got  on Yelp I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it for themselves but just felt that my experience didn't match up to all the good reviews I saw."}
{"text":"Tried their deep fried tofu in red coconut curry and it did not taste that great.! Heard their fried fish in green curry taste good. Too expensive I felt"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai eateries anywhere in the world. No matter where I travel I will try the \"best\" local thai spot. After looking for what was best in town this is showed up. And after a meal, I completely understand why. 

For starters it's always packed with locals who keep coming back for more. The spice levels were on point and they have chopped chili if you need more. The flavors are fresh. And then we were told that it's cooked fresh, nothing is pre made. 

The beef salad is a must. It's real filet mignon unlike other places that use a cheap cut and heavily salt it. Grilled shrimp, green curry, and satay were some other choices and all good. Ask your server for recommendations, they are good what that.

The only thing they need some more attention on is the servers rushing around. Slow down!

I'm surprised there aren't more yelpers reviewing this place. Anyway, if you're looking for good Thai food, don't miss this. It was the highlight of our trip to QC and Montreal."}
{"text":"Overpriced! 12$ for 4 tiny boring spring rolls. 19$ for mediocre Pad Thai, shrimp way over-cooked."}
{"text":"The negative reviews really, really surprise me.  I went here several years back when it was rated just short of a 30 (highest score) on Zagat.  It was beyond incredible; the best Thai I have ever eaten in my life.

Now, I see these reviews and can only think there was perhaps a change in management.  That's disappointing."}
{"text":"descent food, small portions. overpriced food!! bad slow service.

would not return!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm happy about it. It might be a dollar or two more expensive than it should be, but I have had some good thai food in my life, and this is some good thai food. On top of that, the service is really fantastic when you are here as a couple. Maybe even a little too fantastic, but I have to admit.. it's kinda nice sometimes."}
