{"text":"Just had a Cuban sandwich there. Holy mother of God it was good. The staff isn't super chatty but thy definitely care about their food. I'd order in advance to avoid a wait, because it takes time to make food right."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot and recomend to try it out portions are awesome Great food and place to eat very nice pastry staff friendly very clean nicely priced"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, friendly staff and owner.  I ordered the Cuban, the bread was fresh and they used pernil not just bland ordinary pulled pork."}
{"text":"This location just recently opened and I wanted to give it a try and support a restaurant that focuses on delicious Caribbean style foods. The restaurant is quaint and colorful. It is inviting and the staff is very friendly. I ordered the Tripleta Sandwich. It was delicious! It has meat, cheese, ketchup/mayo combo, lettuce, tomatoes and comes with a side of fried plantains. It was toasted and in a Cuban bread. I loved it and highly recommend it! I noticed that they sell desserts like flan, tres leches, tembleque, quesitos, pudding, etc. I can't wait to try those! I also noticed that they sell coffee which, if it is anything like my mom's coffee, it's most likely delicious! How can I forget?! They also sell bottles of coquito! I met the owner, Sergio. Very nice guy. He was appreciative that so many people were trying his restaurant and was open to any recommendations. It was busy, but I am sure it is because people want to try his food and because the restaurant recently opened. The food was worth the wait! I recommend this location to everyone and I will absolutely be back to grub on some more sandwiches and desserts!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the staff was very pleasant. I can't wait to see how they create outdoor seating come summer. Though a deli, I feel this is a place that can one day evolve into a full service restaurant. This is a must try if you are in or near the area. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them more stars and I know they are relatively new and they can definitely improve so with that in mind I dare to give them 3 stars I just wish I could understand why are the sweet stuff to expensive like why? It's just the price with the portion they don't go well together. They are friendly and the food overall is good."}
{"text":"For starters I'd rate customer service and friendliness of staff a solid one 1/2 stars. The lady at the register didn't even ask if we were ready to order or ask if we had any questions with the menu. I think it would be helpful to explain some of the dishes possibly to people who aren't as aware of the menu it would probably make customers more likely to come in and explore the menu. I got a #7 pollo & tostones and the best comparison is to a chicken philly or a chicken panini. It was very good. HOWEVER the tostones ARE TERRIBLY PLAIN. no flavor whatsoever. I think they need to definitely fix those. If they could better explain the menu a little to new comers I'd definitely feel more comfortable coming in and exploring new tastes!"}
