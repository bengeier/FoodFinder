{"text":"I love this place! Everything on the menu is so good, its hard to chose what to get. My favorite thing is the nacho skillet. Definitely my favorite restaurant in downtown Champaign!"}
{"text":"Yelpers, you let us down on this one. 

Precious reviewers noted that while the beer is not exceptional, the food is awesome.

Not. True. This was the worst food I've ever had, by far, at a place that bills itself as a gastropub. Ironically, their slogan is \"boycott bland...\"

We got the bison burger and the bacon mac and cheese. The burger was dry, tasteless, and unevenly cooked (one end was raw and the other was well done). There was no seasoning in the burger at all and it needed some sort of aioli or mayo component. There was way too much bun relative to burger. The worst part, though, was the lettuce. It literally tasted like dirt. No exaggeration--I think this was the worst burger I've ever had.

The bacon mac and cheese was okay in that there was a lot of cheese, but it too was unseasoned and could have used more creamy sauce. It was basically noodles covered in grated melted cheese. 

French fries--hot and good. Not sure this made up for our $45 ticket. 

I was completely depressed to spend my hard earned money on food that was this subpar. Why didn't we say something? Service was abysmally slow, to say the least, and we had four servers over the course of our visit. We didn't want to wait any longer to get out of there.

We did a flight of beers. They were perfectly fine, but not legendary. The mango IPA was tasty and I'd totally get a six pack of it. 

The whole restaurant has a very corporate feel, which I find strange for a brewpub/gastropub. Normally, this food and beer culture lends itself to a friendlier  feel.

But whatever; I won't be back and will consider it a draw if I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"The best thing on the menu was the fries.  I continue to be underwhelmed by this restaurant.  This is my third time,  and enough is enough,  three strikes you're out. 

I went here for dinner this evening,  I am even writing this from the table.  I have had the Thai chicken,  fish and chips,  burger and fries.  All of these were subpar with the exception of the fries.  Temperature  wise the food wasn't hot and even though I shared that the food was not good, no one ever came to the table to address my displeasure.  The waiter was fairly attentive,  but the food was BLAND. 

People often recommend this place,  and for the life of me,  I cannot figure out what the attraction is. Possibly  it is the location or the ambiance,  but shouldn't  it be for the food?  I'm  incredibly disappointed and will need to go elsewhere to find acceptable nourishment."}
{"text":"We always go to Destihl when we visit my daughter and son-in-law -- who happen to be vegan.  This is one of their favorite restaurants though it isn't targeted to vegans.  A great variety of food, perfectly prepared, and complimented by their excellent beers.  Our waiter was upbeat and attentive.  Try their rye wine ale.  It's a little pricey, but a nice treat."}
{"text":"I am so happy the Champaign Destil finally opened!  The food menu is a bit different from the Bloomington one, but awesome nonetheless.  Beer battered bacon is good, flatbreads are awesome, and the stout ice cream sandwiches (incredible!) have enough stout that they card people for that dessert!  4oz taster glasses make trying multiple beers fun, and the bartender will even give you a FREE 2 oz taster if you don't know what you want.  Will be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is above average in selection but average in delivery. We ordered a couple of entr√©e salads which were small but quite good. One person ordered sweet potato fries which were so overcooked we asked for a replacement which was not much better. The iced tea was unique and worth it. I suspect the draw here is the beer which none of us ordered."}
{"text":"Four girls squeezed into a booth. Cue a \"movie\" waiter. 

My friend named our waiter as someone you would see in a comedy movie or sitcom--talkative, funny-ish, and always popping up at random times for small chat. Needless to say, our server was very attentive (e.g., good at recommending/not recommending dishes, clearing the table). He skated the *annoying* line very closely, never crossed it though so hurrah.

Food got thumbs up from us: Med. pizza (really delicious and big for $9), Bison burger (fries were a hit), jambalaya, and dopple chop (it was good, but pricey at $20 for what is received). 

Drink-wise: Belgian pale ale (ugh, no. a bit of an off-taste), torched cherry caiprissima (too much lime juice for me, but my friend loved it), and don juan (nice). 

Overall, a good experience.  But not a place I would have cravings for or feel the need to re-visit. It felt like a safe night-out dinner. Plus you can wear what you'd like, I saw fashions of all kinds without much judgment."}
{"text":"I went here on Friday with four friends. Although the restaurant wasn't filled, the wait to get seated took over forty minutes. The staff was friendly and the mood of the restaurant was comfortable yet fun. As for the food, some of my friends had good dishes, but mine turned out horribly. I had pasta with mushroom sauce and too many chunks of sausage. Each ingredient tasted fine by itself, but together they were a hot mess. I would go here again, but not if there are other options."}
{"text":"Had \"Pork Two Ways\". Fantastic!  Service first class. Excellent cocktails. Large selection of beer and ales. Great place!"}
{"text":"You won't go wrong with anything on the menu. All of the food here is incredible. Things you can't miss: Beer Battered Asparagus,  Flat Iron Steak Quesadilla with Blue Cheese, Mediterranean Pizza and Stuffed Poblano Pepper. Leave room for the S'mores!"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant with great ambiance, depending on who you are being serviced by.  I came for my brother's 21st birthday lunch and the hostess made us wait 30 minutes despite at least 8 tables and booths that were empty.  Not only were we waiting 30 minutes, four parties similar in size were seated within 5 minutes.  She was rude and if she were our only interaction with the restaurant, I'd never want to come back.

The food was not bad, the ancho chip crusted pork loin was huge and delicious, fish and chips had a great batter on it, both top notch. However, the spicy chipotle chicken sandwiches was well seasoned, but could use a little more substance than just chicken and arugula.  There was too much bread for the sandwich. As for sides, the potato wedges were not bad, french fries were soggy and floppy.

Four stars for the food, three for the hostess."}
{"text":"Easily the best Wagyu burger ever! Ask the chef to replace the bleu cheese with goat cheese. It tastes great!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The location is nice and the tables are spacious. It can be both informal or formal and the seating and decor are mellow. The service was very good and our server Aaron was excellent. However....the food is another story.

We started with an appetizer that was fine but our meals were terrible. My date ordered the dijon chicken and it was incredibly dry and also came with TWO HAIRS in it!  My kobe burger was also very dry and unexciting. The bun was stale and the beef was extremely dry and tasteless. For dessert we ordered  a large chocolate cake that was $11. It was okay, but nothing exciting.

I'm not a food snob but for the money I would expect a lot more. Sorry to say that this was my first and last experience at Destihl. I hope others have a more favorable experience."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great- it feels upscale and classy, but the food was sub-par. I'm vegetarian and I thought their pastas were bland. I wish the food matched up to the price I paid for it."}
{"text":"wild sour is my only experience with this brewery. I've never had a more off-putting beer. i'm not even picky, in fact I'm surprised by my motivation to write a review. This beer literally turned me back to major brands just to avoid disappointments like wild sour. I used to love open-air sour brews"}
{"text":"Food ok, service nice but labored.  Overall ok, nothing to get excited or disappointed about.  Solid C"}
{"text":"This place is very hyped up. I will say the service has been great the few times I have been there. Their beer is great and so are their mixed cocktails. The food is decent, but it wasn't over the top great. It is Usually pretty busy and a very clean establishment."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I had the salmon and potato salad.  This is no ordinary salad, the dish is served warm with fingerling potatoes, grilled vegetables and  salmon carefully laid on top with a  spicy mustard sauce. My description doesn't adequately represent the delicious meal. It was quite surprising for a brewery. The staff was great and knew the various beers to recommend to my novice palate. I am more fond of wine.  

Great experience."}
{"text":"Asked waiter J... If they could make apple martini since it wasnt on their menu... He said absolutely! Well, what was made wasnt apple martini... He explained this after I had taken a sip of it.. Had my boyfriend try it also.. Had it returned.. Ordered something else. Couldnt believe he charged us for it.. He should tell patrons they dont have the right stuff to make drinks that r ordered.
Also, food wasnt too bad.. My steak was more well done than medium rare.. Have been here twice.. Last two times was good. This last experience not soo great! They (waiters) need to do a better job with communicating when they r busy! Be consistent with great service n food!"}
{"text":"I could eat the chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon and the Thai fried chicken everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best in Champaign. Try the POBLANO PEPPER. It is sooo incredible. Try it with \"avocado mousse\" which is basically an avocado pesto. Very fresh and pairs so well with the sauce."}
{"text":"Shiny, new, and inviting, Destihl is definitely one of Champaign's nicest restaurants. It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare.  

Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps.  

I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye.  

Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right. I feel like their menu is a bit too unoriginal to justify the price, but regardless, I'm sure you'll enjoy your meal here anyways."}
{"text":"I always stop in at Destihl when I am in town.  My favorite dishes:  the chorizo stuffed dates are absolutely amazing;  the two kinds of pork dish (pulled and ribs) is  succulent and flavorful, and the ca toke (which easily feeds 2) is a decadent way finish the meal.

Also a  great selection of craft beers delivered by servers who are attentive and friendly.  Love this place."}
{"text":"One of the few good, non-chain food options in Champaign, IL. Their cheese curds are to die for and their white sangria is delicious. On busy weekend (Mom's + Dad's weekends, Graduation, Holidays, etc.) reservations are a MUST!

They also sell growlers of their beer!"}
{"text":"Bison Burger
Completely delicious, lean bison surrounded by fresh lettuce, tomato and a thick bun.  It was perfect, not dry!  

My one complaint is the service.  There is one server who takes the order, one who brings the food without direction, and many who wander the restaurant without the initiative to look to see what customers might need. 

Read my review at: http://foodiecoma.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/destihl-restaurant-and-brew-works/

Update: I had their Imperial Stout at the Great Taste of the Midwest beer festival. Awesome! It's dessert in a glass. The brew roster certainly knows their stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered the Steak sandwich...medium. The waitress brought out a big chuck of meat sandwiched between a french roll. When I bit into my sandwich, it was bloody red! Nowhere near medium! On top of that, it was smothered with caramelized onions, which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak! The service was average. Nothing great. Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant, as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"Foodie euphoria. You can presume the food is going to be incredible when they offer a sous-vide entree on the menu. I actually altered my business travel plans to come to Destihl based on Yelp reviews, and am super glad I did. I drove through Illinois on a day trip and passed the Destihl sister location in Normal early in the morning before they had opened, so I decided to stay overnight in Champaign to visit the other Destihl location. I ordered the Red Chili Pork entree and it was, quite simply, remarkable. [note: I posted a tryptich Instagram photo of my dining experience here on Yelp] I also sampled several of their beer offerings, conveniently (and affordably) sold in 4 oz. taster glasses. All were more than satisfactory as compared to other microbreweries, of which I have been to many. The interior is also pleasant, being situated in a newly constructed building. There is outdoor seating, which was in high demand on the warm early evening I was here in late June. As one who travels a lot for work, I can strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and it was delicious!  The only reason I did not give Destihl five stars was that the serving sizes were not as big as I would have liked.  The burgers are a bit pricey, but the food is top quality so it's worth the treat."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Decent wine list. And an extensive gluten free menu to boot. Our go-to place when we are in Champaign."}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan. I try to come here one a month or so. Food is great. Would recommend the cheese curds. They are to die for!"}
{"text":"The beers are always good, sometimes great, and the food has never disappointed me (and it's had many chances to do so). I think what I like most about the food at Destihl is that the dishes I might normally overlook are my favorites, like meatloaf, pot roast, stuffed peppers. All these dishes are humble, but really taken to the next level by the chefs at Destihl. I'd say Destihl is easily my favorite restaurant in Champaign."}
{"text":"This place has great food, wonderful beer and a really pleasant outdoor dining area. Beer battered asparagus is amazing and their Banana Cream Pie is killer!  Only knock is sometime the food takes a little while, but who could notice or care with so many great beers to try! Best place for dinner to start your night out in the downtown area."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely LOVE Destihl!  It has become the go-to place whenever my parents visit (I am in law school).

The first time we went there, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many options were available for myself because I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian.  Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting, but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options.  We started with the beer-battered asparagus which was pretty tasty.  I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing.  It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye, which they both loved.  My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes.  

The second time we went was for lunch.  I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup.  The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious.  Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye.  My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed.

You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch.  They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2:00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well.  We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Plus, they don't have a corkage fee!  The first time we went, we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge!  

All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and pretty good service. Drinks were pretty good as well, bloody marry was great. There beer wasn't spectacular but still good. Recommend the brew master pizza and cheese curds defiently. I had the North Carolina barb q two way and was pretty tasty, coleslaw was amazing and had a little kick to it. Defiently would go back."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation online through yelp and was seated right away. My partner and I were able to taste test some beers and our waiter recommended some for us to try.  The beers are reasonably priced. We started with the pretzel appetizer which was freshly out of the oven and came with two delicious dipping sauces. My partner got the trout and I got the vegan cashew cream zucchini noodles. Both were tasty. As a vegetarian, I appreciated the vegan and gluten free icons on the menu. The icons made it easy. There's lots of vegan/vegetarian and gluten free options available!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal at Destihl.  Pretzel and Reuben appetizers were amazing. We all loved our meals .  The waiter recommended a beer for each of us and we really liked them too. Good service and seated promptly. Great experience."}
{"text":"I've been in for both lunch and dinner multiple times since they opened. I've heard about their Bloomington-Normal location. The food is quite delicious and very flavorful, however I must say they go overboard with heat at times! (But that us a matter of taste of course !) very clean facilities, comfortable space and very nice selection of beer. I must say that the hard alcohol drinks are not always consistent in flavor or liquid amount."}
{"text":"Such a fun trendy location. Nice for a Friday evening out. Amazing signature cocktails and the food was great! Our waiter was also the nicest guy ever. Will definitely be back. However next time we will make a reservation, was a bit of a wait but they did their best to get us seated quickly and we were able to find a spot at the bar while waiting."}
{"text":"Update: I had eaten at Destihl a couple months ago, and the best word for my dining experience at that point would be \"inconsistent.\" Last night I returned to Destihl so that I could form a more definite opinion. For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign."}
{"text":"Passing through town and stopped in Champaign for the night. This place was recommended to me by the front desk clerks at my hotel. If you are a craft beer enthusiast you should definitely stop in. It is definitely worth the short drive even if you are staying by the highway in Motel Hell. I arrived early and was seated promptly at a table in view of a big screen TV near the bar area. My server was knowledgable and attentive. I had a flight of three craft beers, guided by my server. As an appetizer, I had the mac and cheese. Loved it and managed to avoid eating it all so I could take some back to my room. For an entree, I had the salmon over a bed of roasted vegetables. This was also quite good. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse, which is accented by a topping of cinnamon-coated maple bacon (amazing) and mint. This was also good but could be more chocolatey, IMHO. If I lived in the area I would dine here regularly. If you are a visitor, do yourself a favor and avoid the generic chain places by the highway, and drive into town to go here instead."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the waitstaff was very concerned with making sure everyone was happy. I like the prices as well, thumbs up here."}
{"text":"the food is pretty great, price point on part of the menu is fair, others not so much.

however the beer is absolutely incredible. i recommend trying their sours if you get a chance."}
{"text":"We had a nice evening! Mandy was our server and she was great. Very knowledgable about the menu and the beers. I had the spinach salad and the dressing was so yummy...Perfectly sweet and spicy. Was great with the white stout. We finished with the 1lb chocolate layer cake."}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and have been to this restaurant seven times in two weeks. I love almost everything on their menu from the burgers, chili, chorizo-wrapped dates, battered asparagus, Brussel sprout salad and banana creme pie. They serve Wagyu beef burgers or lamb/bison-delicious! I'm not a fan of the Dijon chicken but that's the only thing that hasn't been delicious. My coworkers enjoy the fish tacos a lot. The service here has been great, too. This is my favorite restaurant in Champaign by far."}
{"text":"Super tasty food and a good variety of drinks (lots more than beer for other non-beer lovers). Only issue I had was the excessive saltiness of the food, which is what took this down from a 5 star to a 4 star."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few months ago and have to say I was very impressed with their food.  So much so, that I've gone back several times and introduced numerous people to it.  Their beer is not too bad and they have a wide selection.  Definitely going to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This was short and sweet, but I scouted this place out ahead of time for a visit from out of town.  The best compliment I can think to pay this place is that I wish we had gone here first.  We ate somewhere else (which was good) and tried to get beers at the Blind Pig with little success.  After going here and having a few 4 oz pours among three of us, I REALLY wish we had skipped everything else and ate/had beers here.  If the beer was any indication of the food, we missed out.  Very good."}
{"text":"We were there for a very special going away party.  It was a shame the waiter made us feel so unwelcome.  Typical of CU.  Crummugeonly students who begrudgingly take wait staff jobs but really act as though it's beneath them to the customer.  He was curt and indifferent.  The food was barely so so.. the arugula salad was inedible.  The cook overdosed it with 1/2 cup of salt.  The beer is good, but the server knew little about it.  I won't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"We were told it would be a 35 minute wait. 1/3 of the tables were empty and the hostess just had us standing there. They clearly weren't understaffed so I'm not sure why we were literally standing by empty tables. Once we were sat, the service didn't improve. I'm adding a star just because the beer was decent."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good, service was good, but nothing to RAVE about. 

Must try the beer battered bacon though, quite the experience for your palate."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. The atmosphere is nice, and the food sounded amazing on the menu.  I had a Thai Chicken dish, which was overwhelmingly salty...the idea of it was good, but the rice was drenched in a salty sauce.  The chicken was beer brined and deep fried which was quite tasty, but the sauce sort of killed it.  We also ordered deviled eggs, which were nothing special.  I have had some mind blowing deviled eggs at other restaurants, and I guess I expect when you put a classic on the menu it should be done in a unique new way...which wasn't the case when I had these."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Waited about 10 or so minutes to get seated and then once seated, no waiter came. About 4 waiters passed us, served and checked in with the tables around us. No \"I'll be with you guys in a bit\" or nothing. After about 15 mins of sitting there, me and my husband got up and left. Not sure what the problem was but was very dissatisfied and unhappy."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer, food and staff.  Spicy shrimp Po Boy, IPA and Banana cream pie was great!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorites.  I've been twice now- once for lunch and once for dinner- and have been very impressed by the service. The waitstaff has been extremely helpful, knowledgeable about the menu (both beer and food) and very attentive.

My favorite thing on the menu so far has to be the Flat Iron Quesadilla.  I wasn't that excited about it when I ordered (I planned to share with my mom, and that's what she wanted) but I was extremely impressed.  It's not your typical quesadilla- it comes deconstructed and has components like bleu cheese and roasted garlic vinaigrette.  At the risk of sounding like a total weirdo, I have to confess that I have been thinking about this quesadilla A LOT and cannot wait to go back and have it again! :)

The beer is good and the atmosphere is very modern and chill.  I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best food I've had in a long time, with light, fresh, and unique flavor. I ordered the trout, and the entire dish was fantastic but the corn sauce had some of the better flavor I have ever tasted. Has a fun, hip atmosphere that isn't over done and friendly staff. Plus it is really reasonable for how good the food is. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place serves the weirdest reuben sandwich I've ever had, and not in a good way. Instead of rye bread, they use this cranberry nut bread that, while interesting, is also too thick and dry. Instead of the usual \"Russian dressing\" (similar to thousand island), theirs has this \"mustard\" with an overpowering horseradish taste that is not pleasant at all.

Overall, Destihl seems like a place that tries too hard to be \"hip\" or \"unique\". You can tell just by looking at the extravagant descriptions on their menu. I give them credit for trying new things (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but when it comes to food sometimes it's better to stick with something proven."}
{"text":"Excellent food at very reasonable prices, beer was very tasty, environment was pleasant and even upscale, and I would recommend this place to anyone.  My family thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Back to the beer, I did a sampler and found the various beers to be very much above average.  I tried their hallmark sour beer with trepidation, but enjoyed it.  It's like a cider with a sour twist--done right."}
{"text":"The food at Destihl's is delicious. The bacon mac 'n cheese is some of the best anywhere!! Cooked in a cast iron skillet and loaded with a variety of cheeses! So good!! Would recommend please turning down the lights in the dining room in order to not feel like we are dining at Golden Corral! Atmosphere matters."}
{"text":"Told us it was a 45 minute wait even though tables were empty. Went on yelp and could make a reservation for 15 mins. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of my go-tos, but beer selections are continuing to fall flat. Date night is not quite as enjoyable when my Cab is more manly than the beer the fianc√© has to drink."}
{"text":"Interestingly in the middle of nowhere are a few blocks full of restaurants, somethinv like 40, one of which is this one. Not too bad especially the sitting outside part. For some reason all cities get it right except boston. Anyway, the fried chicken with the thai twist was one of the exciting things on the menu for a brewery type place. Decent attempt, and very flavourful however I would not call it thai per se. Very mild spices...lemon berry desert thing at the end nailed it though."}
{"text":"We have had Destihl in Bloomington-Normal for some time but I've been looking forward to the addition to the Champaign-Urbana restaurant options for some time.  And I'm glad it has arrived!!  I found the atmosphere cozier than the B/N Destihl.  The service was FAST!  My iced tea was never empty (which is impressive because I drink fast and a LOT....which is why I opt for the iced tea and not the beer).

The food did not disappoint.  I'm a fan of the beer battered asparagus appetizer.  And opted for the Brewmaster Pizza on this trip.  Everyone in my party of 6 had something different and came away pleased with their meals.  

I used OpenTable to make a reservation which was quick and convenient.  We were in and out in about an hour....much quicker than I expected.  

In my opinion, a great addition to the Downtown area!  Perfect for dinner before hopping over to The Art Theater!   Welcome Destihl!!!"}
{"text":"The beer here is extremely tasty. And I like how the restaurant decorated. The burger here is better than the dish entries."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Hot Rod Power Tour, and it looked like a good place to check out. Their beers are fantastic, and the food is even better. They don't sell traditional growlers, however they will fill them if you bring one in. Instead, they have 32oz cans that you can purchase filled on the spot with any of the beers they brew. The bar and wait staff were very friendly and had zero complaints about their service. If I'm ever in the area again this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, credit where credit is due: There are some delicious appetizers on the menu, and desserts are HUGE and great for splitting. My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. 

Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.

Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of \"craft beer,\" but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.

This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there. It's confusing. 2 1/2 stars, rounding down."}
{"text":"The thing that comes to mind immediately when I think about Destihl is the phrase \"three stars\". I don't have very much in the way of complaints about Destihl, but I don't exactly have much that makes me love the place either, especially since it is downtown and it has a lot of competition in the restaurant scene that does a better job. Let's start with the beer. To me, being a \"brewpub\", the quality of the beer is pretty sub par. I've had some good brews, but definitely some bad ones. I was here just last week and got a red ale that tasted more or less like fizzy cough syrup. Not the total end of the world, and beer taste is very subjective, but the beer here isn't exactly cheap and I feel like it's one of their main draws as a brewpub. On the other hand, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with the food. They have great pizzas with a pretty neat variety of toppings and some pretty killer appetizers, the thai wings and the pretzels are a pretty normal addition to my dinners here. They will consistently cook a cheeseburger medium rare (sad that's something I have to even say) and the other entrees are usually pretty quality. They have a number of specials usually every week too. All in all, this place is certainly not bad, and I would feel a little more comfortable with giving it a 3.5 instead of a 3, but I would rather round down than up. If you haven't visited I definitely would check it out but after you've been here a couple of times I don't think you will get excited to go back."}
{"text":"I cannot review the food here because the restaurant did not allow us past the front desk.  Arriving on a Wednesday at 12:35 pm,  we were told we would have  a 25 minute wait,  despite there being few patrons in the restaurant. When we inquired as to the reason,  we were informed that there were reservations coming.  Okay,  perhaps,  although we suspected it was because we had 3 toddlers in our party of 8. (Note,  we are all professionals and do not look like haggard ragamuffins.)

Indeed,  our suspicions were confirmed when,  after departing to another downtown Champaign restaurant, we called Destihl to inquire whether they would able to take a party of 8 (immediately; did not inform them of the ages of the guests). And yes,  we were told,  \"absolutely, just come on in.\" \"No wait?\" we asked,  and they responded, \"no, no wait.\"

So there you have it. Needless to say,  we will not be returning or recommending Destihl in the future.  Sad,  because it looks like a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Five years ago I tried Destihl and was not impressed, a year ago for various reasons I decided to give it another go. In that year their service was outstanding, while prices definitely went up the food and its presentation lived up to it. I quickly became the person recommending this establishment to visitors, friends, and colleagues.

Recently, as in this last week, my visit made me uncomfortable, highly dissatisfied, and pushed me to be the person taking pictures of my food.... the people I sometimes roll my eyes out (but no judgement). I decided to order their flat iron steak, which has been quite excellent every other time. Temperature ordered was Medium, the steak was delivered to my table 3 times inaccurate and not properly prepared each time. The server tried his hardest to make things right, but insisted I send the first one back, after I had already agreed to eat what was in front of me. Round two came out, just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. The steak pictured is round two, again what was supposed to be medium came out raw, or blue rare at most. I tried to indulge, I couldn't. Round three I said to my server just cut it up cook it longer medallion like steak bites will work so that I could enjoy the time with company. It's not what was deliverers but I couldn't take it anymore folks. The server began defending kitchen, to the point of blaming the lighting in the restaurant....not acceptable.

Management was aware of the situation and did not check in or table touch my table until I requested to talk to them at the end of this experience. Said management when asked why I was being charge the full amount for the horrible experience and entree insisted that it was due to \"waste cost.\" 

I have rated this experience as such due to the a managements inability to be proactive and have an upset customer leave happy in any way possible. They had the ability to make a bad situation better. I'm hoping this was just a \"rare\" occasion for Destihl."}
{"text":"The place looks great and I love the beer. The food looks great but it doesnt taste great.... it's usually overly salted. like calm down with the salt shaker.

I like that they offer $2 mini beers so that you can try multiple. That's a-okay in my book. 

one last thing... what's up with the waiters? ALL of them! They've all got the personalities of awkward engineers.  I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I.  Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences. WAAAAH?

Anyways, moderate place for food, good place for beer, awkward but polite service."}
{"text":"Best roast chicken I have ever had. Slurped the bones. Bread pudding dessert was also great. Beer was fabulous. Glad I stumbled on this place. If I ever come to Urbana again, I will definitely seek it out."}
{"text":"Reading other comments about the high prices here made me chuckle. We felt like Distihl was a great bargain, but since we are from Chicago, our scale is perhaps skewed. Dinner for 6 for $100 made this place fantastic for the price. Granted we were not drinking, but still. The cassoulet was very good, if light on the promised sausage. We will go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"If its TL;DR: Great food, great drinks, great service.

I've gone to Desthil a few times, and I'm consistently impressed by their food and attention to detail.
Once, I sat at the bar with my dad, just there for drinks; bartender was great, amiable and had suggestions when we knew what we liked and wanted recommendations. Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. 

Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a \"fried chicken\" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. 

The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. 

Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!"}
{"text":"Nacho appetizer was awesome! Meat loaf was very dry! Flat iron steak was average. Service was top notch! Nice atmosphere. A little pricey for the quality of food. This is the place if all you want is great appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! I've been here twice within a week (once for lunch and once for dinner) and was wowed each time by the food and the excellent service from the waiters! Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"I have had two meh experiences here.  The atmosphere is great.  The deco is great.  The service was meh.  The food is just ok.  I had the jumbalya the first time and a pepperoni pizza today.  Both okay experiences. Highlight food wise: my kids were given root beer floats at the end of service.  Nice touch.  I would try it again but only if it was someone else's Idea.  It is a cool place just not a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group of friends and felt the food was very over rated.  Bison burger was salty and the service was took forever.  Had to ask for condiments after the food arrived and drinks took forever.  Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Desthil a couple times, and it's pretty nice. The burgers are really good, as are the Cuban sandwiches. I was also fond of the house drafts that I tried (including an apricot beer that's one of my favorite Belgians). The beers they brew onsite are all really good. The dessert menu is also fantastic- try the chocolate cake that's the size of your head if you're looking for diabetes. The Smores plate is also fun.

All that said, the food here is a bit more expensive than it's worth. Burgers are cheaper (and better) at Farren's, Radio Maria has better Cubans for the price and the entrees are nothing too impressive- good, but not great. I've also found service to be a bit hit or miss- we've had waiters that have been remarkably friendly and courteous, but last time they substituted a more expensive glass of wine for one they apparently didn't have without telling us. I like going here, and it's a nice change of pace every once in a while, but rarely do I go \"Boy, we need to go to Desthil.\""}
{"text":"Beer-Battered Asparagus, Craft Beer, and great food on the menu.   You can't beat it."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong here. The beers they have on tap are always spectacular and the ones brewed in store are even better. It's an all-around homie environment, haters are stopped at the door."}
{"text":"The food is presented beautifully. There's not a bad choice on the menu with decent prices. Staff is well trained. Tasty entrees plus a killer Reuben and burger. I highly recommend it as one of Champaign's best."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great menu for vegetarians. The tempura asparagus is delicious! They have an imaginative, healthy (but tasty!) deconstructed chicken pot pie that my husband enjoyed. The risotto was very good. The carrot cake slice is huge but that's good because it's so moist and flavorful you won't want to share but will have trouble finishing it yourself. It seemed to be kid-friendly too (we didn't have children with us)."}
{"text":"The beverages are good.  The food is average.  Everything tastes a bit bland."}
{"text":"Destihl is an upscale pub-style restaurant with a low key atmosphere.  The menu is quite large and has a lot of variety from small tapas style plates, to salads, pizzas, burgers, steaks, entrees, and even some thai-fusion style dishes.  Because of the variety, I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you're not sure what type of food they prefer.  The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent, but I've never been blown away by any of their brews.  

I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon. On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce, the server asked if I would like more.   I am not a dessert person, but I LOVE their dessert menu.  So, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert!

Be warned, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait. I have actually left a few times when I haven't been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving.  If you sit in the main dining room however, the service is superb."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my friend.
The interior design is interesting as you can see the machines which I guess should be for brewing.
I wanted something salty that morning so I ordered the chilaquiles. I never tried it before, but I like it. Different flavors confused together.
My friend ordered the mascarpone french toast. He likes it too. It's not too sweet and the softness is great.
The service is also good. 
We are planning to come again for their beer."}
{"text":"Chain-like food in a chain-like setting.  The pizzas are ok, but not outstanding. The burgers are pretty good (but not blow-you-away good), the beers are pretty good (but not the best you can get in Champaign -- go to the Blind Pig or Triptych for those), the service is always friendly and chipper. But definitely adequate for a casual bite with friends.  Their signature beer battered bacon should be tried once, and then quickly forgotten (it's amazing in that way that you hate to love it).  My major complaint is that they over-salt things -- salads are too salty, fries are too salty, etc."}
{"text":"Good variety of menu items.  Brewed on site beer is high quality."}
{"text":"Excellent service, all meals of our group of 14 came on time, the food was great and the prices like in any restaurant - about 15-20$ a person including a drink!
I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary ever. Best in Champaign, best in the world. Decked out in all possible garnishes and gleaming like a amazing tomato mountain."}
{"text":"I ate here May 2013 and enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Came back February 6 and had terrible service.   I was seated at a table and waited 14 minutes without seeing a waiter or being offered a drink.   A table directly across from me sat down after me, was given water and drinks.    I asked to see the manager waited another ten minutes so got up and left.  Only as I was walking out the door was the manager able to find me."}
{"text":"When I looked at their menu online, I was intrigued by how varied and tasty it looked. However, I feel like they are more concerned with making food sound good than taste good, and more concerned with breadth of options than quality. I did enjoy the beers that I tried, and the service was fast and friendly. The swordfish tacos were very dry and the tortillas were so chewy that the tacos just fell apart. The rice and bean side was a joke because there were just a few beans mixed in the rice which had no flavor. I want to go back and try some other options, but from what I tried off my friends' plates, everything was pretty lackluster and much more bland than the menu made it sound."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad.  The decor looks like the contractor went to Lowe's or Home Depot and bought all the \"fancy\" materials from the discontinued materials section (and just a note here to the management: really?  bathroom stall doors that go all the way to the floor?  Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee-filled serial killer).  The service was equally uninspired -- my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent, and the food was mediocre when it got there. It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant, but no such luck.  And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources. This might be technically true -- they might like it -- but there's not much evidence that they actually do it.  I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Having heard and read so many different views on Destihl, I was looking forward to being part of a group dinner tonight. My group of 12 was immediately seated and drink orders were quickly taken. Service was interesting. Although our waiter was excellent, there seemed to be several uncertainties when drinks and food were brought to the table. Things got to where they needed to be, but I was surprised there seemed to be so much trouble just getting the orders to the correct guests.

The food was wonderful! We had some excellent shared appetizers -- beer-battered asparagus, stone oven pretzels and beer-battered bacon. I had the Greekish salad and the cedar plank salmon. My wife had bacon & brussels and roasted beet salad. Others had a variety of chicken, seafood and meat entrees. For dessert my wife and I shared the chocolate cake.

I tried a few of the four ounce beer samples and had a bloody mary. The beer was very good, the bloody mary excellent in presentation but only average in taste.

We were not expecting to spend almost three hours having a leisurely dinner, but the evening was very nice. I was impressed with the general vibe for a Saturday night.

All in all, I was impressed with Destihl and will definitely come back to try lunch or perhaps dinner with my wife or a smaller group."}
{"text":"Destihl has a HUGE menu. This is a great place to go if you want options. They've got burgers, sandwiches, salads, seafood, pizza, a bunch of appetizers and more. They also have a gluten free menu which is pretty rare in Champaign. They have a gluten free crust for pizzas, but it is baked in the same oven as the regular pizzas. They also have a great brunch menu on weekends.

I've come here a bunch of times and overall I've been really happy with my experiences. I've had two bad experiences though. Once I got some entree that was pretty worthless and one time I had a waiter that continually messed up our orders throughout the course of dinner. Besides those two occasions, the food and service have both been great.

Food recommendations:
Appetizers - Ancho Chips & Dip
                      Bacon & Brussels
                      Chorizo Stuffed Dates
Salads - Ancho Chicken Salad
                Thai Steak Salad
Entrees - Dijon Chicken
                 Cedar Plank Salmon (If you're in the mood for something light and simple)
                 Gaucho Skirt Steak (The best option on the menu!)
Drinks - The Bloody Mary is pretty delicious

I almost always get the gaucho skirt steak. I've never been disappointed with it! 

Again, if you want a place with lots of options and good food, definitely check out Destihl!"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker, so my opinion is based solely on food, atmosphere, and service.

First of all, their menu is extremely imaginative and varied. I had very hard time deciding on what to order on my two visits here. Be careful when they ask what kind of salad you want when you order - because they're going to charge you ~$8 for it if you bite. The food has been sensational, but they tend to overseason some dishes. Several people in our party ordered Caesar salads (which is half a head of romaine topped with a fried egg) and they were grossly over peppered. The pulled pork from my Carolina pork two ways was the spiciest pulled pork I've ever tasted in my life, so much so that I couldn't take more than two bites in a row. It wasn't a problem ubiquitous throughout our group or between visits, though.

The atmosphere is very nice. It's dark and clean. The service has always been good."}
{"text":"The pastrami reuben is bad.

I always come here with a desire for sour beer and good food, but the pastrami reuben is bad.

They brew a lot of good beers, and I really enjoy their wild sour series. My friend said he felt like a kid eating warheads. But their beer selection isn't just sours - they offer some really smooth and really strong beers, but I don't know enough beer words to do them justice. The pastrami reuben is bad.

I love the chorizo stuffed dates appetizer, and their pretzel and asparagus aren't bad either. The pastrami reuben is bad.

Their burgers are really greasy and fatteningly delicious. The Dijon chicken is so tender and comes with just the right amount of Dijon. They have a \"pound of chocolate cake\" which my friends love, but I personally think their carrot cake is the one to die for. The pastrami reuben is bad.

The food is pretty pricey for urbana-champaign, but not bad for a downtown restaurant. But no price could ever convince me to order the pastrami reuben again.

The pastrami reuben looked like a great sandwich. It had a bunch of pastrami and fancy looking bread. But that's exactly the problem - they tried so hard to make it fancy that it tasted like a misguided dessert. The bread was studded with so many blueberries that all I could taste was fruit. The sauerkraut was mashed together and fried. Fancy, but that took out all the sour flavor and left a dry, crunchy patty. The bread was way too big and thick and dry. My mouth was a desert, constantly bombarded by lip ripping, roof of mouth scraping chunks of tough blueberry bread. What little meat flavor that made it to my tongue was instantly washed out by all the water I had to drink. There was also no horseradish. Or if there was, I could neither see nor taste it.

A pastrami reuben should be about the meat. It should be tasty and juicy and slathered with horseradish and stuffed with sauerkraut. Yet at destihl, I got a fried blueberry pastry. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Really good vegetarian options. Thank you for that! Stick with the pizzas and burgers. Their entrees are a little on the small side for the price.
Their carrot cake is to die for!! Their chocolate cake is awesome too. 
Free dessert on your birthday :)
Cocktails are OK. The \"fresh margarita\" (not on the menu) is the best one; the others are watered down, let's be honest. If they had better drinks, I would give them 5 stars and would probably go there every weekend. Now that Boltini is closed, C-U is in desperate need of a decent cocktail bar.
I've eaten here several times over the last 3 years and always get great service."}
{"text":"We always enjoy eating here.  Great staff, nice atmosphere (especially if you can eat outside) and of course, good food.  We've had many menu items, and we can always rely on a tasty good quality meal."}
{"text":"Terrific place to grab some food and a pint. The staff here is extremely friendly and courteous. The food is on par and goes well with some fine brew that is on tap. I like this place for lunch and would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place very much for lunch.  We started with the beer battered asparagus - yum!  We were happy to see that they offer 4 ounce glasses of beer and sampled several good beers. The menu is varied and inspired.  Everything we tried can hold its own with any big city restaurant we've tried.  The restaurant is sleek and beautiful and the service was great."}
{"text":"If there were an option for negative stars, DESTIHL Champaign would have a rating of -5 stars.  What a complete failure this restaurant is.  This place reminds me too much of the Jim Gould success failure story.  It's a tale of how a restaurant owner and chef become to sure of themselves and stop trying only to discover complete failure.  

I pride myself in knowing good food and good restaurants.  I have studied cullinary technique and have a passion for fresh, quality ingredients that produces a meal that leaves you longing for more.  I write this review, having visited DESTIHL three times spread out over the course of a year.  I sent my food back two out of the three times.  The second time, I ordered the veggie burger which was hands down the WORST veggie burger I've ever sampled.  I did not send this back because it was not the way the burger was cooked, it was a pure and simple failure on the design.  

My first experience I ordered swordfish.  It was overcooked, returned and cooked perfectly.  My husband ordered the Bison burger, medium rare and it came out well done.  While waiting for the food to return, the manager apologized and brought us free appetizers.  The meal ticket was reduced due to the error in the kitchen.  I was optimistic about this restaurant and the situation was handled perfectly.

Last night, I returned for what I was hoping to be a perfect swordfish.  My husband's and I's order was the same.  Bison burger and swordfish.  First try at our order lended the same results.  Both dishes overcooked and returned.  Second try at our order, my husbands burger was cooked perfectly, my swordfish was raw.  Third try at the swordfish, still raw!  I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation.  Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating \"this is cooked to the chef's perfection.\"  The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon.  Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw.  

My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad.  This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate.  No order, presentation was horrible.  The dressing was red oil.  This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all.  I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad.  Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply.  

I would recommend no one go to this restaurant.  Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant.  This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.

EDIT:  Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager.  He was very kind and appologized.  More than this he listened.  He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid.  He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses.  Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.

In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return.  The following is my email to the manager of destihl.

I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign.  We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved.  Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar.  My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly.  The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder.  I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error.  I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both.  I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye.  My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out!  Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer.  With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received.  Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign."}
{"text":"Our waiter was really nice, but the food was just OK this time. Unfortunately they did not have the Asian chicken wings or Cherry French Toast on the menu that we really enjoyed the last time we ate there. 

We went there for lunch & I ordered a Thai steak salad. The steak was overcooked in chunks & there were only a few slices of steak. The dressing was sour & just OK. The rest of my family ordered the beer battered bacon app which they loved. My son enjoys the pork sandwich. Their house made chips & chocolate cake are very good."}
{"text":"Service was stellar. The waiter was very kind and the atmosphere was great! It put a smile on my face. It took less than 5 minutes to get seated and less than 10 minutes to have our order taken. Within 2 minutes of having our order taken, the soup we ordered came out. The main entree came out in a timely fashion as well.

Items I ordered were:
Three Cheese & Ale Soup
Stuffed Poblano Pepper
Cajun-Style Shrimp Po' Boy

The soup was overall very delicious. It was a bit salty but the creamy consistency was amazing and the bacon and green onions really gave the dish some nice texture and crunch. The soup also had a slight bitterness which was good as well. I highly recommend this dish. 

The stuffed pepper had great flavor but lacked texture. The potato and cheese filling was a bit mushy and the pepper being mushy as well didn't help. I wish the pepper had a bit more crunchy texture to accompany the creaminess of the potato and cheese. The sauce was great and had a nice flavor with some heat. The rice and corn was delicious as well. I probably wouldn't recommend this dish. 

The po' boy was pretty good. The bread was toasted well and gave the sandwich a nice crunch. Shrimp was a bit overcooked and the veggies were kind of just slammed together in some sauce. However, flavor was there. I took a risk in ordering a Louisiana style dish here and it didn't really hit the mark. I would still recommend this dish nonetheless. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but the service is what made this place shine. Therefore, 4 stars it is! Overall, not a bad experience and would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Destihl is one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Champaign. I recommend the stuffed Poblano Pepper- it's absolutely delicious. Also, great selection of alcohol!"}
{"text":"This is a microbrewery, which makes me a fan of the restaurant. Every few months, they have different beers to try which is great. The food is pretty good. It is a great restaurant to go with big groups. If you go during lunch on a weekday and they know you're at work, they usually get your food out pretty quickly to make sure you can get back to work in time. Of course that also depends on where you work. I worked right downtown, so it was nice to have Destihl as a lunch option."}
{"text":"My teammate and I had two delicious dinners here. We loved the \"bacon egg and cheese\" deviled eggs. I enjoyed, on separate occasions, the chipotle chicken sandwich (good sweet potato fries) and the grilled and stuffed. I also sampled my teammate's meat loaf; that tasted incredible as well. 

I loved my cocktails, which include the Vanilla and Mint, Dark and Stormy, and the Aztec Chocolate. The last one was amazing - it had a spicy kick to it. 

The atmosphere and service were incredible as well. If in town again I would make it a point to return here."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Destihl, I want to love it but I always leave disappointed. The menu is very creative in concept but the execution is always sub par. I've tried the seared scallops over curried mashed potatoes and the thai half chicken. The scallops were hardly seared and the potatoes were waaaaay over salted. The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Destihl yesterday afternoon specifically to try the Dosvidanya stout. It didn't disappoint!

We also ordered the Skillet Nachos appetizer. I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh ingredients ---- really liked the pico, cilantro, and pork! 

We will definitely stop by again. I love being able to order 4 ounce tasters of beer. It's a great way to try all Destihl has to offer."}
{"text":"My first experience was on a date.  I misheard what the waiter said when he was listing the specials.  I asked him to repeat after he was done speaking. He sighed and sort of rolled his eyes.  I ordered a turkey burger (because I'm epic classy like that).  It was cold.  It tasted like it would have been delicious had it arrived at my table 10 min sooner.

My second time was just last night.  I sat at the bar with a friend to have appetizers and a few beers.  The lady at the bar was too busy literally dancing with her fellow employee (boyfriend?) and kept kissing and dancing by the kitchen to ever get my second drink.

The appetizer I order was incredibly spicy, therefore it had no flavor other than pepper, and was also quite greasy.  

On top of that the manager saw a buddy of his sitting next to us.  They both got into their conversation for a good 10-15min and began talking quite loudly.  I could not hear the company next to me telling a story.

I may give it another shot, but its pretty unlikely."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant/brew pub.  The beer selection is pretty good here if you want to try different beers, and their food is pretty good.  I came here for brunch which was average, but I really enjoyed the pizza I ordered on a different occasion.  I would recommend this place as a nice spot to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Beer was AWSOME and a Great selection. 

I had the deep fried bacon. Sorry very disappointed. The side that was crispy had a good flavor, the other side had too much batter and lacked flavor. 

I also had the fish and chips the fish was great unfortunately the chips which ranged in size resulted in potatoes having were not cooked completely they had crunchy spots. Ugh they are French frys and the place was not busy on a Tuesday evening. 

The staff was friendly and service was prompt. Restrooms were clean.  It is worth another shot as the reviews on Yelp are mixed and they could of had a bad night."}
{"text":"Beer is seriously bad here, and the food is horrendous.  Want beer brats with cabbage?  Great, enjoy your greasy, deep fried brats with chopped onions (apparently they ran out of cabbage).  Dates with cheese and bacon?  Enjoy your dates with no cheese, but covered in chimichurro sauce for some reason.  Three dates, which equals two dollars each.  Total waste of money.  The decor is weirdly airport/hotelesque.  Back to the beer.  Tried four sampler sizes, two are ok, two taste like ice wine.  No fizz, and all sugar."}
{"text":"Great place to go in Champaign. A little bit expensive here, but honestly the price is reasonable for the food you get.

For the food, the Flat Iron and Thai chicken are good. The Thai chicken is a little salty and spicy.

For the dessert, the chocolate cake is delicious and... quite big!!

The non-alcohol drink.. Well, you may not want to try the crazy berry.

Definitely want to come here again ;)"}
{"text":"After waiting years for this to finally open (and moving 2 years ago) I finally tried it out on my way back to St. Louis from the Chicago area.  It was after 2 pm, so no idea how things are during peak times.  I liked the atmosphere, although the AC was at arctic levels.  I enjoyed my food and drink, but since I was traveling, I just got a sampler of the Altercation (a good compromise between light and dark), and the spinach salad (enjoyed the maple bacon dressing) and the Cuban Pork.  Recommended stop in downtown Champaign - in the large condo tower on Neil in downtown.  There's a gigantic parking deck behind it, or metered parking in the city lot across the street, where there are 2 Zipcars stationed.  Good move, Champaign."}
{"text":"Left a good review for Destihl a couple months ago. Was just relocating to Champaign and enjoying the food. Now that I live in downtown Champaign I've order out a couple times.... and they somehow manage mess up the simplest order. Very sad, but fortunately there are many other local options."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped dates a bit spicy but very good flavor. Swordfish tacos delicious & the rice/black beans that came with it had a great ancho chili flavor. Beer battered fish sandwich very tasty & great chips with it. Overall a delicious lunch today!"}
{"text":"They have a varied selection of good beers they brew in house. The food has certainly gotten better since I've first been there."}
{"text":"I didn't find this place to be as good as everyone proclaimed. But so many of my friends told me to go here that I even gave it a second chance. For me, the food was just way too salty. Their beer was really good though. I may go there for been but definitely not food again. The only thing I really liked was their dates which were stuffed with goat cheese and then wrapped in bacon."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here four times. All four were great. Good food for sure. The spot has a chain feel to it honestly, but the staff is nice and efficient. I am not a big fan of their beers, but to each their own eh?  I live around the corner, and well.. it's kinda funny that it took me a year to finally walk in the door. Glad I did. Can be a bit pricey for the amount of actual food, but I should be grateful that I'm not allowed to gorge on the goodness of their food.
I\"m happy to see the diversity in downtown. Not just another bar that is."}
{"text":"We ordered via grubhub from here the other day for the first time.  The food was excellent!! We have definitely found a new good spot and will be eating from here again!  My only two slight disappointments were that the bruschetta was a little soggy/topping had fallen off .  I wish they did like other places and sent the topping in containers to put on the bread yourself so you don't have that issue.  Also the bread pudding which I'm sure would be great if you were eating in the restaurant, basically turned to mush and wasn't very appealing.  It did not travel well, but overall the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Just not as impressive as they think they are"}
{"text":"The food was okay and the service was slow. I'm a big beer drinker and I found their beer to be below basic knockoffs of superior brews."}
{"text":"Had lunch here 2/8/13. Server was Melanie. She was cute polite knowledgeable and competent. Had something akin to a club sandwich and potato bacon soup. It was good. Overall nothing to call anyone out on ;)"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was Ah-Mazing! We ordered the pretzel appetizer and they were soft and delicious. The mustard sauce that came with it had a wonderful pop of flavor, very original. The beer battered bacon was also delicious! 

We ordered the jambalaya and Dijon chicken and we both had to take home leftovers. The portions are hearty and the food is so flavorful. 

Our waiter Brad was awesome! He was very helpful and took the time to go over the menu. Great service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat right off campus. You HAVE to get the beer battered asparagus...AMAZING. You don't even have to be an asparagus person, this appetizer is amazing. The batter on it is so yummy and the sauce drizzled on top is the perfect touch. We also got this shrimp appetizer we liked but I forgot what it's called (picture in review). I split the potatoes and salmon and the spicy Thai shrimp with my mom. The waiter had said the Thai shrimp is sometimes sent back to the kitchen because it's too spicy but I thought it was the perfect kick. The garlic bread it's served with is good to tone down the spice as well. The salmon and potatoes were my favorite though. The honey mustard sauce perfectly blends all the flavors together, highly recommend it! The waiter was super friendly and explained all we asked about the menu in helpful detail and the environment is very clean. Overall, a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"The staff was courteous and the atmosphere was great. I had the flat iron steak and it was well-prepared and well-present. Another great restaurant in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Despite the lack of love for Destihl on Yelp, I have to say: I am besotted.

besotted/bis√§tid/ - Adjective: 
1. Strongly infatuated: \"he became besotted with his best friend's sister\".
2. Intoxicated; drunk.

Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)

We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.
Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.
Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. 
Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. 
Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to  5 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! 
Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda
-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!
-House Olives app
-Spinach salad
-Soup
-Bacon cheeseburger special
-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwiches

So while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U."}
{"text":"Once again--And it's happened several times!  We have  been asked to wait when several tables are open-as in almost half the tables. This time 8:00pm on a Tuesday--hardly high dinning hour in central Illinois. 

When hard pressed the manager on duty  (Justin Kelly)  said the servers are fully occupied with other tables and we would prefer you wait in the lobby instead of at your table. 

Their hard and fast rules are first not guest friendly. We were once told at 8:40 all of tables were reserved. When we left the reserved signs could still be seen. NO GUESTS IN SITE! Clearly a lie. 

In stead of asking an available server to pick up our table they (management) would prefer us to wait. We will not be back. Their management needs to evaluate this process. The  food and service are usually ok. Good luck with getting a table when they are all \"reserved\". Oh we got in immediately at a restaurant across the street and were given the table we asked for."}
{"text":"Hands down this place is the go to! We go there for nice dress up dates or for a casual beer and appetizers! Great service and the food is just amazing!"}
{"text":"After several times of driving past Destihl and thinking I'd come to try their brews one day, I finally made it, except not for the beer. I made a reservation through yelp for lunch and was promptly seated as soon as we arrived.  Our party ordered the beer battered asparagus and absolutely loved it.  The overall service was great and very respectful in helping my grandma get through the doors with her walker. The only reason for rating 4 stars instead of 5 would be that our waitress seemed impatient with giving us a few minutes to order and came off a bit rude when asking who would be taking the check. Regardless,  I'll be back for the beer, Destihl!!"}
{"text":"After many recommendations to dine at this restaurant when visiting University of Illinois, I finally came here with my family to try it out. I'm very glad we did because we had a great experience! I would say the whole party was pretty satisfied with the meal. Some of us tried the beers brewed in house- I especially liked the 4 oz options.
We ordered shrimp ceviche and the duck seared salad for apps to share, and the duck seared salad was great. A little too much dressing, but the duck was very flavorful. My entr√©e choice was the broccolini and feta salad with salmon. The charred broccollini was delicious! Probably not too healthy but very tasty and salty! I love the huge portions at Destihl also. 
For dessert, we had the pound of chocolate cake, banana cream pie, and caramel sundae. All desserts were actually very mediocre sadly. I was excited to try them all, but the chocolate cake was pretty tasteless, as were the other desserts. 
Overall though, the service was great (a bit slow) but very accommodating. The restaurant is an awesome spot for huge groups too! Decent food, huge portions, and good vibes all around."}
{"text":"While not overly impressed with what I had to eat I was impressed by the service and atmosphere.  I detected horseradish in the salad dressing and she immediately took care of it.  I hate horseradish and anything that even remotely resembles it.  My Grandmother had me grind horseradish roots once and it was awful.  My eyes watered and the stench was terrible.  Every since then I have not been able to tolerate it.

I had the house salad with a portabello mushroom sandwich.  I didn't think the sandwich had much flavor.  We also ordered an appetizer sampler that included fried asparagus, bacon deviled eggs and some kind of egg roll.  All of which I thought tasted good but I didn't have that \"oh wow\" thing going on either.  It was a special deal for restaurant week.  You got 2 of each item for $10.00.  Some special huh?

I would definitely go back and try again and hopefully I can give them more stars.  The service was really good."}
{"text":"Good beer and decent staff. Our waitress was friendly and pretty knowledgeable about the beer selection and recommendations based on our tastes. It's a nice after work spot or maybe a good 'in-and-out quick bite and a beer' before a show."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday afternoon. Plenty of available seating and the hostess provided excellent service. Their burgers are always great. This time I tried 1/2 Havarti and Turkey Sandwich and 1/2 Ancho Chicken Salad with a side of Chipotle Coleslaw. The sandwich was pretty average, while the salad and coleslaw were fresh and flavorful. Overall, the service was really good for the price of food"}
{"text":"Awesome. Food was delish; decor was very fresh and service was excellent. I'll definitely go back if I'm ever in Champaign again."}
{"text":"Miley family loves it. I've been several times and the Pot Pie was good. Service is always very friendly. Local craft beers are featured but none of the ones I tried rang my bell.
Oh, the pretzel appetizer is really good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a favorite. No matter what you eat, you can be assured it will be good. The Cuban sandwich has become one of my favorite sandwiches, the salad with goat cheese and fruit is good; the nachos are tasty, and the deserts are huge and out of this world. The sangria is a very tasty drink."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very cute, located in downtown Champaign with seating outside. Our server was Ariel (who was wonderful) and we were celebrating my daughter's bday who is a student at U of I.  We had the cheese curds which are awesome and really crispy and warm and yummy. We had those with the champaign blanc beer (yum) and for dinner we had the chicken pizza, bison burgers and the egg burger - everything was really delicious. Cooked to your liking.  For dessert we had the cherry bread pudding which was amazing, never had that before and the strawberry/mascarpone crapes (those were just OK).  They weren't warm as you expect crepes to be and the crape itself was almost too hard and crispy rather than soft and warm so next time I will skip those and go straight for the cherry pudding.  Overall, I have never really found a place that I would go to again while vising U of I but I would definately return to Destihl especially for the cheese curds and beer, which if you are a beer lover they have a very nice selection.  Thanks again Ariel for your excellent customer service and for being so attentive to our table!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in C-U . The strawberry goat cheese salad is my favorite and don't forget the strawberry pale ale."}
{"text":"This is a fun place with a trendy atmosphere. It's one of the few places in town that allow you to mix and match beer flights at a fair price. The food is fun and tasty. I recommend the mussels, pizzas, and wings."}
{"text":"I was recently invited to Champaign for a grad-school interview, and went out to dinner at Destihl on one of the nights I spent in town. I have to say that I found it very amusing that the priciest restaurant I went to on this trip was also the worst meal of the trip by far.

I ordered the goat-cheese pesto pizza, shared the battered asparagus appetizer, and had pint of the brown ale. The battered asparagus was alright but EXTREMELY greasy, the pizza was soggy and surprisingly didn't really taste like basil or goat cheese, and the brown ale was flat out bad (trust me, I drink a lot of microbrew beer, I know what good beer tastes like). Plus, most other people at my table agreed that their food and drinks were also mediocre. 

Needless to say, since this is an pricier restaurant, I doubt I'd be willing to give Destihl another shot."}
{"text":"Not worth the high cost.  Go across the street for a bit better grub if you want to spend the money."}
{"text":"Worst service in Champaign. We spent three hours for dinner: late reservation, drinks took nearly an hour, food took an hour, and it took them half an hour to process our checks. It was a comedy of errors. Food was average at best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and the service was amazing. We had a huge group, and the waitress made sure that everyone was attended to and satisfied with their meals. She made a couple rounds with us to make sure we all had enough water as well. 

I had the braised pot roast, and I am so glad I picked it! I was scrolling through Yelp reviews myself when I was here, deciding what dish to choose. I was surprised to find that /no one/ commented on this dish, so I decided to give it a try. 

Braised pot roast [$13.95]: The braised beef was so incredibly soft and tender - I don't think I've ever had beef this tender before. It melts into your mouth so easily and tastes oh-so-good. It was a pretty generous helping of the braised beef as well. I thought it paired beautifully with the saut√©ed vegetables and mashed potatoes with gravy. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and airy, definitely made in house. Everything was like a wonderful melody playing in my head... couldn't stop eating it until I finished the entire plate! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this plate; DO give it a try!"}
{"text":"I think their cedar plank salmon is off the hook good. The service is usually in point and I've never waited very long for a table. Great place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The date wrapped bacon a must try! Their blonde ale nice and light. David had the Asian paste. It was okay and spicy. Joyce had the hamburger with bacon and hand cut crispy fries.... The atmosphere was nice (elegant for a brewery) and clean and they have patio sitting, dogs allowed outdoors that is. Overall will return!"}
{"text":"Very unique place to eat in Champaign.  My ceder plank salmon was excellent. I'm not much of a beer drinker but the 4oz pick your own flights are fun to try."}
{"text":"My wife, son, and I ate at Destihl a few days ago and had a fantastic experience there! This is a fairly new restaurant in downtown Champaign, and it's a place not to miss. Their menu is innovative, wide-ranging, and worthy of repeated visits. 

Dana, our server, was just superb! She responded to all our questions with a special attentiveness, and offered great advice on unusual food choices and palate-pleasing brews. She followed up often to make sure everything was just right throughout the meal. They should clone her! 

My wife had their charred broccolini and feta salad with other fantastic ingredients that she loved. My son had the havarti and hickory-smoked turkey sandwich on ciabatta that made him moan with delight. Having messed up my appetite earlier in the day on snacks, I ordered the corn and chicken chowder that turned out to be one of the best soups in recent memory, and a perfect choice for a light meal. 

Destihl Restaurant & Brew Works is a gem in the Champaign-Urbana area. Go try it out and you'll see what I mean!"}
{"text":"Always content at Destihl. It's a nice safe choice. 

Appetizers: 
-bavarian pretzel: I love their pretzels here. It's so fluffy 
-chorizo stuffed dates: My favorite dish I had that day. Everything about it meshed together so well. Sweetness from the date, a little salty from the bacon that's wrapped around the dates. Great texture because of the crispyness from the bacon and softness from the dates. Loved it!

Meal: 
I got the Beer battered bacon and egg burger. I really liked it! The beer battered bacon was delicious. Egg was nice touch, but could have done without it. 

My cousin got the Carolina BBQ? (forgot what it was called) They were decent, but if you're looking for a good meat dish, I would go elsewhere. 

Pizza is quite mediocre. Sorry :( My excuse is that I live near Chicago. 

Overall, their menu is about 3 pages with all sorts of dishes. I think it's a little too ambitious, resulting in nothing that special about their restaurant (except for their beer! good beer) which is why I think that it's a nice, safe choice because you never leave disappointed. But, it won't be something like, \"THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD.\" (Probably some place I would go twice a year?)"}
{"text":"I think this place is a little bit over-hyped. The burgers are pretty fantastic and quite juicy, but the food takes quite a bit of time to prepare. Not in the this-is-gonna-be-awesome type of preparation, but more of the my-food-is-lukewarm preparation. Given the amount of time you have to put into reservations and fighting the crowds, I say there are better bets elsewhere. However, definitely still worth a taste if you're into fancy interiors and great service."}
{"text":"Well, I searched the website to see where I wanted to have my birthday dinner with my coworkers.  I was seeking out a restaurant that had a little bit of this and a little bit of that so that everyone can find something that they would enjoy eating.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes and we kept on watching the staff bring out different dishes as we would comment how yummy it looks.

I was torn between two dishes and I asked the staff their recommendation.  She did not steer me wrong.  It was so tasty that I wanted to eat another entree of it.  Every dish they brought to the table look so tempting.  Definitely a wide variety and everyone enjoyed a nice beer and atmosphere.  

Glad we made reservations because the place filled up quick for a Friday night.  Service was awesome and I am already missing it.  I will definitely be back before I leave town."}
{"text":"Tried this place around 5:30 on a weeknight and it was not at all busy. It did start getting busier towards the end of the meal, but our service was good. Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers  as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.

Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  We had a large group of people celebrating my grandma's birthday.  There was about 15 of us so we had our own separate room.  The service was really great! I wish I knew the waiters name because he went above and beyond to make sure we all had what we need.  It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were.  I liked the menu selection here to.  Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants.  They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes.  Pretty cool.

Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalape√±o bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good.  For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork.  It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though.  I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that.  Everyone seemed to love their food here.  

Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! 

The prices were also fair.  I really enjoyed this place! Wish there was more places like this (for this same price range) around Schaumburg."}
{"text":"The wait staff have been among the friendliest I have encountered in town. Last night I had a good mojito. For food, it is sometimes hit and miss. I love the salmon salad. The goat cheese and spinach salad was a little skimpy and I didn't recognize the two little dollops of goat cheese on the salad. The tortilla soup was also nothing to write home about. It is the only place in town with cheese curds!  I absolutely love the baked apple dessert! In the evenings, the sun is in just the right place to give a nice shade for the outdoor seating. All in all, I have always enjoyed my visits to Destihl."}
{"text":"The menu has a good variety of options, which is nice.  I have had the bison burger twice, but they seem to always cook it a little too much. I tried it medium once and medium rare another time, and both times they cooked it longer than they should of.  But it still tasted good.  

Service at the bar was very good."}
{"text":"We are staying in Champaign on our way back to the East coast. We looked at Yelp and as soon as I saw Destihl's menu I knew this was the place. It was terrific! Our server, Alex, was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The menu was everything I'd hoped for and tasted as good as it sounded in print. I had the Minted Man cocktail. Refreshing and delicious! The sandwiches were huge and delicious. I wish we'd split a sandwich and saved room for dessert. We are already looking for reasons to come back to Champaign so we can eat here again!"}
{"text":"The menu has changed considerably from a couple years ago. The Food is adequate but not great for the price like it used to be. The Hamburgers are OK, but not really worth $15. I assume the $35 steak is an attempt at humor."}
{"text":"They have good food options. They could work more on the vegetarian options. Nice beer. Some people may like this, but I personally don't like waiters coming back every 10-15 mins asking how the food is and if everything is okay. But I understand that they are trained to do the same."}
{"text":"I really was not expecting to give a brewpub 5 stars...but here goes...
We went on a Monday night, and the restaurant was FULL which was A) good to see for a new business and B) surprising! The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.
The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.
The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!
Service was excellent from beginning to end.
The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.
Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!"}
{"text":"DESTIHL is one of my go-to's when bringing friends and family from out of town out to dinner- not only does it have an extensive menu that will cater to even the pickiest of guests, their service is excellent and we always leave there full and happy! 

For apps: The Bavarian style pretzels are soft and fluffy, and the IPA mustard sauce is a nice treat. We have also enjoyed the skillet nachos, and the cheese curds; however, we usually go for a dessert instead of an app.

Entrees:I try to get something new each time I go, and some of my favorites include the dijon chicken, the coulotte steak, the vegan squash and cashew cream \"pasta\", the gaucho skirt steak, and the brewmaster's pizza.

Like I said, don't skip on the dessert; I get the chocolate peanut butter mousse cake every single time (though you'll want to share it if you want to be able to walk out of the restaurant on your own!), and the toffee date doughnuts are a surprising treat. My fiance adores their giant carrot cake and sour cherry bread pudding if you're not a chocolate lover like me.

I do recommend making a reservation as it can get quite busy, and though I haven't been yet I have heard fabulous things about their weekend brunch so give that a shot if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Terrific menu and service. My daughter and I had the Bavarian pretzels as appetizer (warning two gigantic pretzels!)--they were fresh and deliciously soft and warm--but very filling. My daughter had the bacon cheeseburger and I had the brewmaster pizza. Both were good enough to warrant repeat visits. We ordered the carrot cake to go--it's gigantic and exceptional--the size of a serving platter. We blissfully worked on it for two days."}
{"text":"We always give this place a try every couple of years, just because it's one of the nicer places to eat around downtown and some people love it, but everytime I have went it has been awful. I always say no pickles (or sauce based on pickles) and they always put it on. And everytime we say something we are given a rude stare by the server and an attitude about it. After bringing out a \"new dish\" it's obvious it's the same one and they just took it off. Pickles have strong flavor, you can't hide it. And sometimes you can see that the sauce had been scraped. Overall, very negative experience and too many things with pickles."}
{"text":"My kid begged me to give Desthil another chance so I obliged. This time the service didn't disappoint. We had the same waitress as before which made it a tad awkward since our past experience was very blah. After eating, one of the managers or perhaps an asst. manager came by. She indicated that our waitress had revealed our past unhappy experience and wanted to make sure we were ok and appreciated that we had come back. Needles to say I was very surprised. Props to the waitress for not only remembering but acknowledging our prior discontent. We were given a comp card and apologized for the past fumble. I appreciated it. I guess any establishment can have a bad night. The food was on point."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the beer was flat, the service was poor, and the atmosphere was rushed and unattractive.  How can a brewery serve flat beer and keep it's doors open?  Hopefully, it was a bad night"}
{"text":"It is a place with excellent service and excellent food. The quality of the food is better than the price and the place has a classy atmosphere without the pompous attitude."}
{"text":"Last time I went to i tried two of the appetizers, the ceviche and the cured salmon, and I can say it is the best thing I've tried there so far! The staff was absolutely amazing. 
Howver, although the dijon chicken saucewas great, the chicken itself was a bit dry and the sitting and food wait time was ridiculously long!!!"}
{"text":"Destihl is one of my favorite restaurants in champaign! I travel for work, and this is definitely a great place to eat/ drink alone or with a group. If eating at the bar, the servers are very attentive. If eating at a table, it's the same as well. If you can eat on the patio, do it. 

The menu is extensive and has a great variety-- whether you're looking for sandwich/burger or a full entree. Everything I've tried so far has been great. They also have awesome beers. They brew sour beers, which I had never tried until I came here. 

Overall, great place to go no matter what you're looking for! Try the salmon and the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"We were sat in one of the bar high tops for an 830 Saturday night dinner. Service was prompt and casual. I had a martini but would probably stick to beer in the future. Different beer portions allow for different tastings. The dessert list looked interesting but we were too full to try anything. 

CHORIZO STUFFED DATES ($5.95 for 3 small dates) - The dates had a nice smokiness flavor to them and did not need the sauce which over powered the dish. 

DUCK CONFIT POT PIE ($15.95) - At first I thought it looked soupy but once I started eating it realized the vegetable to sauce ratio was well balanced. The crust is non traditional as a pillow of herb puff pastry sitting on top of the vegetables (duck confit, roasted golden beets, brussels sprouts, pearl onions, sweet potatoes, green beans, fingerling potatoes, and swiss chard). A tad too salty but otherwise a playful, hearty dish.

CUBAN-STYLE PORK ($9.95) - A good portion with juicy ham and all the fixings. 

Come in for some local beer and casual bites."}
{"text":"This place has it together! We came here after waiting 25 minutes at a nearby restaurant with no service. DESTIHL was very busy, which is always a good sign. After a brief wait, we were seated and acknowledged immediately by our server. Not only were the beers top notch, but the food and service was as well! We had water refills and empty plates cleared by other servers who happened to be walking by. We couldn't have asked for a better experience!"}
{"text":"I had a really good Thai pork pizza here. Waiter was very personable. We were able to get in with a party of 4 on the Friday night of graduation weekend without a reservation around 5pm- didn't think it was possible given how popular this place is.  My family had been there before and said the beer battered bacon appetizer was amazing, so we ordered it and it didn't quite live up to the memories of it.  Lots of beers and wines, but appeared to not have ciders."}
{"text":"My sons favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana!  I would call it eclectic bar food. Excellent appetizers - especially the beer battered bacon and the fried green tomatoes.  This was our fourth time eating there and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a couple times. The food is good and they have some interesting specialty beers on occasion. I don't really go here to eat, even though the food is good and nothing's wrong with it. It's just not my go to place when my friends and I want to go out somewhere. 

Perhaps I will update my review the next time I eat there. For now, this is all I've got.

3/15/2015 update: I came here for Sunday brunch with a large group of friends. I had half a Cuban sandwich and the strawberry goat cheese salad. Both very delicious. Although, I think I'll order the French toast next time, it looked so good! :) Brunch is a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love Destihl! We have come here many times and always bring our out of town friends here.  It's always busy, and with good reason. The atmosphere is casual, and the food is great and decent quality. Our friends love the samples of their micro-brews. From \"Smile Politely,\" (Champaign-Urbana's online magazine) \"DESTIHL Restaurant & Brew Works of Champaign, Illinois, won a bronze medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado for its Strawberry Blonde Ale in the 'Fruit Beer' category.\"

The menu has many options ranging from salads to burgers to pizza.
 I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. 
My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. 

Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I tried out Destihl this past weekend and it was definitely one of the best meals I've had since moving to Illinois.

For our appetizer, we had the warm pretzels.  I'm a big fan of the cheese sauce they come with and they were gone pretty quickly.  I also sampled the fried cheese curds and they were tasty as well.  For my meal, I had the fried egg BLT.  You really can't go wrong with bacon, a fried egg and avocado on a sandwich.  The garlic dressing on  the sandwich was great too.  I was really pleased.

I ordered an iced tea and I think it's my own fault for not looking at it on the menu, but I expected a regular iced tea.  Their iced tea is an orange tea that has a pretty strong orange flavor.  I wasn't a fan.  Our server exchanged it for a soda and I wasn't charged for it.

Definitely give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Destihl, I just find myself truly enjoying every dish. There are always some really interesting flavors going on and Destihl really does distinguish itself above its competitors, the other sort of new american or gastropub restaurants.

Destihl does brew its own beer and it's generally pretty good, always a very reasonable price. You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.

This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. 
Must Have.

I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.
I'd get it again in a heartbeat.

Only downside, no room for dessert.
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service,  great food. Our waitress was attentive and accommodating, they had homemade beer battered bacon, which was unbelievable"}
{"text":"My first and hopefully last visit to Destihl was a faculty dinner (Destihl is apparently one of the few places in town large enough to accommodate simultaneous departmental functions, as there were multiple university-based parties that night). But this convenience is off-set by the depressingly overblown chain aesthetic, here manifesting as a too-self-conscious effort to seem \"on trend\" with both gastro pubs and microbreweries (witness, for instance, the giant prop barrels by the front door) while failing to capture the particular qualities of either. 

The \"artisan food\" was as mediocre as expected from this self-described \"gastrobrewpub TM.\" We ordered pizzas as appetizers for the table; \"stone oven\" seems to be a euphemism for \"toaster oven.\" The crusts were uniformly thin, but creepily so, without bubbling or crispness; the undersides were barely cooked. I suspect pre-formed frozen dough, by the taste and all-too-regular texture. The generous toppings were not supported by the crust, making each slice limp and increasingly wet. We also ordered the deep-fried asparagus, but I refrained -- the asparagus looked both too thick (these stalks were almost hot-dog-sized in circumference!) and too greasy.

One of our dinner companions warned us against ordering burgers; on her last visit, her medium rare burger was burned black on one side (and was not at all medium rare). She guessed that the cooks went outside for a smoke and forgot to flip the burgers, but generously wondered if it had just been a long night for them in the kitchen. In an attempt to heed her advice, I tried to order the grilled and stuffed pasta without olives, but the waiter told me that the olives \"are already mixed in.\" I took that to mean that the pasta is made in a giant vat ahead of time (here I imagined a big plastic tub covered in Saran wrap in a walk-in freezer), and grilled to order, which didn't sound all that appetizing. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger (black beans and rice), and my g.f. the Kobe burger, medium rare. Both arrived with one black, charred side; her burger was well-done, ruining the meat. (Why eat Kobe beef if it's just going to be burned to a crisp?) My veggie burger was unremarkable, and my pile of shoestring fries had been overcooked in the fryer, and served to me lukewarm to cold -- totally inedible. I nibbled on two and then had to stop. Cold grease, ugh.

I'd much rather order a burger and fries from Steak 'n' Shake, where you know what you're getting for the money. Overall, Destihl was a big \"no way.\" I will strenuously avoid coming here again!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit my daughter at University of Illinois, we come to Destihl. The food is fantastic and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Try the soft pretzels with drinks or dinner and the stout ice cream and split their huge serving of chocolate cake for desert. 

The rest of the food is pretty tasty but less outstanding. One of the only microbrews in town, so props for that. Not unreasonable prices, but a little more than some nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Drinks: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5

Service: Every waiter or waitress I've had at Destihl have been fantastic at their job and go above and beyond. They definitely deserve a 20%+ for their outstanding service. They treat everyone right no matter how you're dressed or who you are.

Food: I've never had a negative experience with their food. It's never over salted which unfortunately seems to be a problem with nearby restaurants and definitely never bland. Almost everything is seasoned to perfection and done right. Whoever their head chef is definitely deserves props.

Drinks: Destihl has their own brewery and their beers are definitely one of the high points of not just their restaurant but the town. Highly recommend the Destihl Hefeweizen, one of the best there is.

Atmosphere: It's definitely upscale, but not snobby, the best mix of comfort and friendliness you can find in a restaurant. Everyone is there to have a great time and not to impress."}
{"text":"Luckily, we went with family, so we got to eat off each other's plates! Everything was DELICIOUS! We started off with 4 appetizers. The deep fried bacon, fried green tomatoes, soft pretzels, and bacon wrapped dates. All were fabulous and recommended, but the fried green tomatoes were unbelievable! You really can't go wrong with this menu, and the wait staff is really knowledgeable. They helped guide those who were unsure to a good choice. The poblano peppers with chorizo was off the charts great and the Thai chicken wasn't too far behind. The fried bacon and egg burger was out of this world, but you better have a big appetite! One of the teenagers ordered fish and chips. They even elevated fish and chips! Even with all of this food, we ordered dessert! The sour cherry bread pudding and the banana cream pie were my favorites! The carrot cake was a close second! We had a great family dinner and EVERYONE loved what they got and went home happy! And with a family of 14, that almost never happens."}
{"text":"It was an alright meal with good things and just ok things.

The good: That cucumber/rose martini. Yes. Also, the fried green tomatoes appetizer with the crab/avocado salad on top. So delicious! Swordfish tacos were enjoyed.

The bad: the bacon wrapped dates. The bacon wasn't crispy so it was tough to chew. The sauce was so spicy we were practically crying. Salmon sandwich special was not as good as anticipated, and the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger was also not crispy. 

The service was so-so. While our waiter at the beginning was friendly, he repeatedly forgot things so we would spend time sitting there staring at our food because we didn't have plates or silverware. They also ran out of wine glasses so we were left sitting through our entrees without drinks that were ordered before entrees arrived, and he didn't tell us until we were finished eating.

Overall, it'd be worth a shot to visit again but if the 2nd experience was similar or worse, I wouldn't try a 3rd time."}
{"text":"Take a look at Destihl's menu and it looks likes an epicurean delight. Their menu is over 3 pages chock full of impressive ingredients, classic american fare as well as intriguing fusion items. The beer is delicious and brewed in house. So how could this local watering hole get two stars? By attempting to do everything, Destihl doesn't distinguish itself as doing anything particularly well.

I had the cuban style sandwich, which was not only pricey but also mediocre. I've eaten cubanos for years and theirs was merely average. I like a heaping of mustard and pickle to cut the richness of the ham and braised pork but theirs was entirely dry, lacking any kind of condiment to make the sandwich go down easier. Additionally, their side of cucumbers in a sambal and sesame oil sauce was way too spicy, without the usual east asian accompaniment of vinegar to smooth out the pure heat from the sambal. Vinegar and sesame oil is a very traditional way of dressing cucumbers in China so there is no excuse for missing out on that ingredient. 

What's more egregious was my dining companion's reuben sandwich, which completely lacked any kind of russian or thousand island dressing altogether. Although both rather goy individuals, we do appreciate that a reuben basically demands some kind of dressing like that. 

It could be that we picked some items on the menu that the kitchen considers afterthoughts but after a lackluster experience I will be way more guarded the next time I am here."}
{"text":"Came here once with a big group. Portions were huge and dessert was delicious (and pretty!). ...Then someone got food poisoning and had to sleep it off for the rest of the day. It was probably the beer, since the only person to get it was the only person to get sick and we shared everything else around the table. It was an experience but I'm not sure if I would come here again without some amount of peer pressure."}
{"text":"I'm a beer nerd, and I'm disappointed by this place so far. I plan to give it more chances, but I've tried the brown ale, Belgian single, a kolsch, and a pale ale, and have been relatively uninspired by nearly all of them.

The website lists some hoppier alternatives, but I haven't seen them actually on the menu."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????One word for the ladies at the front: unprofessional."}
{"text":"I had 2 different beers; they were both pretty good. 

I ordered the mussels. Over half were not open. I sent them back. Second time about 5 were not open (not acceptable to me). The broth was good, however. 

I also had the pepperoni pizza. It was decent. My bf got the cod, it was very tasty. Next time, I will probably try an entree. 

It was very busy when we went, but we sat in the bar. Service was good."}
{"text":"I travel a ton for work and dine out more than I probably want to. I am typically pretty much numb to restaurant food but my meal tonight was absolutely fantastic. First of all the beer was really good, the service was fantastic and very friendly and my meal was  phenomenal. I had the house salad and the flat iron steak with blue cheese fingerling potatoes and saut√©ed asparagus. The chimichurri sauce on the side was literally the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Went out with a couple of my friend's for one of their birthdays. It was our first time there and the food was so savory and the portion size was more than enough as well! We tried 8 of their 4oz beers and all of them tasting great. Our server Hannah was super helpful and very attentive. Overall, great food, great vibes, great drinks, great service."}
{"text":"What a great meal and fun time last night.
Server was Alex and he was outstanding!
started with a flight and a drink and the battered bacon, YUM
Hubby had the skirt steak I had the jambalaya
topped it off with dessert and we never do that, pastry with fresh fruit and lemon curd
We did not want to leave and can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went here with friends last week. I'll begin by saying that the food is a bit pricey for Champaign-Urbana, but you do get what you pay for. I had an amazing steak meal with an excellent entree, great microbrew beer and amazing desert. 

A lot of the dishes feature very interesting combinations of tastes and textures that add up to very delicious food. 

The decor is nice; lots of dark hardwood in a fairly unique interior. 

One word of advice: make a reservation if you're going during the evening. The place is very busy."}
{"text":"Once a year we go to Champaign and I always dread the restaurant choices.  We like this place!  Easy going vibe, spacious bar, everything squeaky clean, good beers to sample and the good variety menu that goes along well with everything.  
The sandwiches, soup and salads were excellent for lunch and there were plenty of people sampling the many items on the menu... which made it impossible for us to get a table the next night without waiting.  So next time when I go, I will make a reservation."}
{"text":"We had 12:30 lunch reservations.  Waited to be seated roughly 10 minutes. Sat unattended for 20 minutes.   At 1:00 we finally saw a server.  This was the first time someone had even acknowleged us.  we ordered beers and the waited another 20 minutes for the first round to arrive at our table.  50 minutes after walking in we finally had a drink!  At a bar no less! We were celebrating a birthday and would have ordered more rounds of drinks if we could have.  we saw the server 3-5 times total and only were able to order 2 beers.  My hamburger was raw and an individual kids pizza was terrible.  The topping just slid off of the crust.  Very sad we chose this option."}
{"text":"Normal, IL location.  Came for the beer and a snack on our way driving home to Madison WI from Memphis.  We had an hour to spend since we had a 10 -12 hr drive incl breaks.  Super upscale brewpub compared to what we're used to in WI (this was especially disliked by my beer connoisseur boyfriend).  Keep in mind we came on New Year's Eve at about 8:00 and the customers and hosts may have bee more dressy than usual (waitstaff in jeans, collared shirts).  The server greeted us promptly.  She was very nice and it's obvious she takes pride in doing a good job.  She took literally about 5 minutes to tell us in depth about the food specials, down to that they use butter not margarine, desert specials down to what pannacotta is and its texture ...uh yea, I know what pannacotta is..., where the beef comes from, how much the 32oz steak weighs with and without the bone..... We aren't big meat eaters and rarely eat beef.  Got the $12 ceviche appetizer, which was good.  The beer is EXCELLENT.  Hefeweizen, Sours, chocolate raspberry stout (prominent rasp/chocolate flavored but not sweet -like many fruit/chocolate beers- faintly tart from raspberries and nicely baking cocoa type bitter from the chocolate... Interesting to have bitter in beer not from hops) and couple others.
At the end, we mentioned to our server we came mainly for the beer and even if for food it would be good to find out if the customer is interested in the item before going in depth of detail.... Particularly before they have drinks or even water in front of them.... About 5 min after she took our drink order, she came back with water and we watched our drinks appear on the bar 5 min later and sit there another 5 while she was at another table (going in depth again?). She acknowledged she went deep in detail with the food but said they're supposed to.  I suggest they reconsider the approach with this."}
{"text":"Decent beers and bar. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff, a good default selection if you can't decide where to go in downtown CU. The food is the weak part of the place (usually under-seasoned and just bland in my opinion), with exception of some pizzas, and the desserts that are generally pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been to Destihl a handful of times, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. That being said, I still find it hard to give it 5 stars. It's one of those places that although it's very good, it's not as great as expected.

The atmosphere is nice, and gives you a kind of upscale type of vibe. The beer is spot on every time we go. They brew their own beer and there's something available for everyone's taste. The menu is unique in that they offer a lot of dishes that you won't find somewhere else in CU, such as their swordfish tacos (which are amazing). Although the food is good, it's quite pricey. The beer is definitely the backbone of this place.

Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. If you love beer and quality food, it's definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Been there two times. One time was way back with a group of friends on busy Saturday lunch. Had to wait for some time which wasn't a problem but once we got seated no one came to our table for almost thirty minutes. Finally, the server came and said since we carried some drinks with us while waiting for the table at the bar he thought we had ordered already and was taken care of. Then, I ordered Dijon chicken it wasn't that good either. Left half of it in the plate.

Today, it had been long since we hadn't gone to dine in  at this place so we went for the dinner. The service was fast and good. Our server had good knowledge of the food and beer collection they had. The beer was awesome. The food however, was just ok! We got bacon appetizer which was just ok, and the chicken pot pie and chicken risotto. The food was just on the ok side. Nothing to rave about. This place is good for some beers but food wise i really don't prefer to eat here."}
{"text":"Hmm.  The problem with Destihl is that it's either GOOD or it's BAD.  That's kind of why the review is an in-between.  

This place is off the charts when it comes to liquor.  Just don't buy booze here.  That's my honest feedback.  We had a party of 8, once, and only a few drinks were ordered (a couple waters, two ordered pop) and the bill was something astronomical (like $180!).  

The other thing about Destihl is that it's a microbrewery (and,-cough-, gastropub) that's trying to be a microbrewery and a -cough- gastropub, if you catch my drift?  If not, here's the thing-- it's pretentious as all get out.  And for who knows what reason, really.  It's kind of a dimly lit restaurant/bar that's just as non-descript as any other.  It tries too hard to be what it thinks it is, and doesn't try hard enough to be a good restaurant.

With that said, though, some of their food is just out-of-the-ballpark, OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD awesome.  All of their soups (3 cheese and ale, or the tomato basil).  The Havarti and Turkey is lovely, as is the Cuban style pork (tho, I did find a very unappetizing piece of fat in it the very last time I had it, so it kind of put me off it for a while).

You can't go wrong with a burger. =)  But, then again, it's a burger, they're not reinventing the airplane.

I say... if you want to spend a mint for the possibility of some good food, and then an outrageous bar tab, pick Destihl.  But if you're looking for beer and semi-comparable food, check out Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings. The same in theory, just a different point-of-view."}
{"text":"Tasty food, solid drink selection, and great location in the heart of downtown Champaign. It's not on my \"must-visit\" list, but it's one of my regular options for lunch or night on the town. 

I'd recommend the beer battered bacon cheeseburger. It's delicious and beyond indulgent.

I'm not a fan of their house brews, though. It seems like, regardless of style, most of them taste too much alike. I'm just not a fan of the brewmaster's style."}
{"text":"I wanted to come back and let ya'll know that Destihl has recently become vegan-friendly!  The marinated cucumbers and beer-battered asparagus are both vegan as-is, and Destihl has added an 8 oz veggie burger to their menu that can be made vegan if the mayo's left off.  I believe there are a few other items that are vegan (the peanuts and the chips are, sans ranch dip), but I haven't confirmed them with the chef, so I'll leave you to figure that out on your own!"}
{"text":"Hitting the big 5-0-0 with a great restaurant from my hometown!

-

The vitals:

Downtown microbrewery + restaurant with a slightly hip industrial vibe.  Great food, great beer.  Best part?  Small (4oz) tasting portions $1-2.  GREAT service.

-

Every time I visit my parents in good ol' Chambana they have a \"new restaurant in town\" that hubby and I MUST try.  Or five.  This time, Destihl was first on their list... and they are so crazy about it, they took us twice.  In ONE DAY.

First, for lunch.  No beer this visit (hence the second), just lunch.  I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries, and it was 100% delish.  Also on the table:

- Stuffed poblano pepper
- Cuban sandwich
- Salad with ahi tuna
- Clam chowder 

I heard nothing but raves from the group.

Late that evening we stopped in for post-dinner drinks \"and maybe a little to munch on.\"  We got three appetizers for the table:

- Chorizo & Potato Flautas
- Marinated Cucumbers (there's some BITE to those suckers!)
- Brewmaster's Pizza (yuuuuuumm)

... and all got a few 4oz tasting pours.  The beer was fantastic, some of the best I've had.  Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.


One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told (more than once) about his friend's first visit.  They were a big group, 12 I think, and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown.  They ordered food, drinks, then dessert.  There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while... they were now running short on time, so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him, maybe a touch rudely, that they \"needed either dessert or the check, because we gotta get out of here.\"  The manager came back a couple of minutes later, apologized profusely, and served their dessert.  Dessert or check, and Destihl chose dessert.  Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house.

It's those kinds of stories that spread your business' name in the best possible way - you chose wisely, Destihl.  The guy's been sending over everyone he knows, always prompting with \"you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me!\""}
{"text":"Destihl is one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign-Urbana. My friends and I loved coming here. It caters to almost every taste. There are burgers, pasta, vegetarian dishes, pizza, sandwiches, and more. Also, the beer is soooo good!!!!! They make their own beer and they have a distillery inside the restaurant, which is really cool.. They offer 4oz drinks for less than $2, so you can try out multiple drinks if you can't decide what you want. 

The beer battered asparagus is a MUST try!!! The sweet but tangy Asian inspired sauce drizzled on top of the asparagus was so delicious. The size of the asparagus' was ginormous! 10/10 everyone should try these. Our server saw how much I liked the sauce and brought out a side of the sauce for me to dip my fries in haha. 

Also, the beer-battered bacon and egg burger is amazing!!! If you are a burger lover, you HAVE to try this burger. The beer-battered bacon was astonishing. It was crunchy, flavorful, and different. I loved it. It was messy because of the egg, but you know it's going to be good when it's messy."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm a little surprised that Destihl's Yelp rating isn't higher. 

Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign. The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday, so I'd imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights. 

Beers = good. I think we tried 4? The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.

We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..

My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I \"won\" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.

We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys  does require a bit of food and drink. 

I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger.."}
{"text":"The food is kinda greasy. Not as expected. I have had Destihl in other cities, they were better than this one in Champaign."}
{"text":"Awesome fried bacon, salad and main dish worth it for non vegan gluten person selection smaller for those items and not nearly as fun"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place about 6 months before I tried it out, and I'm mad at myself for missing out for so long. The food is affordable for a student on a budget, and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or group outing. It's the perfect place for students to bring their visiting parents, too.
The beer comes in sizes ranging from 4oz to 16oz, so you can try different brews if you're in the mood for that. The Tomato & Bread salad is absolutely phenomenal, and I have added chicken to it and had that as my entree on more than one occasion. This is one restaurant I really miss since graduating U of I and leaving the area."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the vibes here and their appetizers! We got the fried asparagus, cheese curds, and pretzels and they were delicious! However, I would say that their main dishes are eh. Got the pesto pasta and a pizza."}
{"text":"I just really don't think Destihl is that great. We tried them when they first opened years ago and I remember not caring for them. Wanted to give them another try and was just as disappointed as before. Beer was okay. Nothing special. But the food just was not that good. The sausage on my pizza was overtly fatty tasting and didn't have much flavor except for grease. The dates were solid as rocks and barely had any flavor. The decor also makes you feel like you're in the lobby of a hotel chain. It also took forever to get our drinks, and they weren't that busy. I just am not a fan of this place and won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this oasis of fantastic flavor.  The grilled stuffed pasta was so mind-bendingly delicious that I tried to recreate this at home.  While the description and use of two sauces sounds like it would contradict itself, each of the components blend marvelously in your mouth.

I sampled soups and small bites as well.  Over all, I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don't compete for attention.  There is a certain finesse that's being used in the kitchen to render distinctly memorable flavor profiles.  

The atmosphere was inviting, modern and clean.  The service staff knowledgeable and attentive.  I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again."}
{"text":"Loved the weekend brunch menu! Lots of different choices instead of the basic eggs and bacon. I had the skillet and it was delicious. We had a reservation and we were seated immediately upon arriving. Waiter was very attentive. It did talke a long time to get our food but it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The key to getting to eat here is to have a reservation. Last year we came with a reservation once and without another time. When we did not have a reservation we were simply turned away even though we could see tons of empty tables.

Recently we left the game early and called them from the parking lot at 2:45 and made a reservation for 3:15. We were promptly escorted to a roomy booth which really worked out because other people ended up joining us. 

We had to wait for a while for the other people to show up and the staff was very amenable to it, acted like that was just fine. They even held back our entree order until they got there.

We liked the deviled eggs for the appetizer, they were really good. I had the chili which was very disappointing, I wouldn't get it again. My wife and I split the Cubano sandwich which was Okay.

Nice big space, great staff and if you have a reservation, great place.  But the food is kindof college town fare which the space is not. 

Too bad as last time we were here the food was better."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Destihl, I sat in the dining room; things were okay.  The next time, and every time since, I have sat at the bar; things were remarkable.  I enjoy having the direct interaction with the team of wonderfully skilled bartenders.  Their attention to detail and good cheer make the bar a must for anyone I take out in Champaign.  

The roasted peanuts covered in delectable spices and drizzled with fresh lime juice make the perfect accoutrement to the always great, fresh beer; the bbq burger is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had."}
{"text":"First of all, I found a short black hair in my leftovers (I have long blonde hair). Disgusting and completely unsanitary. 

Second, the food is decent, but overrated. The steaks are OK. The service is OK. And for being one of the most popular restaurants in town, it should be much better quality, both in terms of service and food. 

Save your $ and go to Seven Saints instead. Also never had a hair in my food there..."}
{"text":"We have been to Destihl several times. I've heard beer enthusiasts say that their brewery and beers aren't that great, but the food more than makes up for it. Everything I've ordered has been great, and the service is spot-on. I've gone with just my husband, larger groups of adults, and have also gone with the kids. It's been smooth sailing no matter the size or composition of the group. Their kids menu is broader than most, which is nice. The regular menu offers unique dishes that have always enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

I certainly like Destihl, but I'm not quite in love with it. I was mentally writing my review all throughout dinner, and it was a solid 4 stars--until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay for amazing food, but it's gotta be spot-on. 

Our dinner for 2 was $120, after tip. We had 2 drinks each, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. 

And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.

Here's what we had:
--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.
--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.
--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. 
--Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.

The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub. Our server was also very nice, but he was a bit new and didn't quite know the menu well yet.

While I'm not head over heals for this place, I do think it's a great addition to the downtown Champaign scene! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city... especially for that banana pudding."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign, followed by O'Charley's and TGI Fridays.  The food here is simply delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Try the 
Thai Fried Chicken, spicy and incredibly good.  The food is good, the wait staff is friendly and the location is ideal.   I simply love Destihl and I didn't even mention the great variety of beers.  Oh, I just did."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Destihl several times - it is consistently pretty good, occasionally exceptional, and rarely subpar.  The staff is always really nice, they are almost aggressive about refilling soda (glasses rarely get to empty, and aren't left empty for more than a minute or two!), reservations and parking are easy, the booths are comfy, and there are some really good items on the menu (Cuban sandwich, the burgers, the ancho chicken, and the huevos rancheros are great; the deep fried bacon can be skipped)."}
{"text":"The place located in downtown Champaign has awesome ambience and good food! Though it lies on a little costlier side. The cocktails here are not that good but the main dishes are superb. The pizzas are like regular ones but better taste wise that normal ones. Overall it's one of the best places to go for a date!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with high expectations, and was bitterly disappointed.   I ordered the \"choose two,\" including the pastrami reuben sandwich and the beer cheese soup.   A brew-pub has to have great beer-cheese soup, right?  WRONG!!!!  The soup was like a creamy caraway broth with some green onion garnish.  No taste of cheese or beer, just gross.  The Pastrami Reuben, described as served on Cranberry Nut bread, looked interesting on the menu.  However, what I received was essentially a large cranberry nut scone (about 4\" tall) sliced in half with three small pieces of pastrami, a few shreds of sauerkraut, and invisible swiss cheese.  I normally do not send things back in a restaurant, but this showing was so horrible, I sent it back.  I tried the $13 American Kobe burger instead.  Eh.  It was an average - but by no means worth $13 - burger (think akin to the pre-made patties you find at Sam's Club) and, once again, the bread-to-meat ratio was WAY off.   Anyway, $40 later, we walked out very disappointed.  I can think of several places in town I could go and spend much less for a much higher quality experience."}
{"text":"Occasionally, very rarely if truth be told, one finds oneself in Champaign, home of University of Illnois at Urbana-Champaign Campus and gateway to the high plains. It is one of those lovely little Midwestern university towns where one could spend a nice life far from the cut and thrust of city life. 

When in Champaign, one could do worse than to eat at Destihl. The place is modern brew pub of the sort that was popular in the late 90s in fleshpots like San Francisco. Get their flight, it is quite good. The Amber is sweet and floral. They serve nice gastro pub fare. I had the fish (of some sort) that was quite nice. Mid-west prices. 

Sit on the corner patio in front of Destihl, sipping their beer and watching the sunset on downtown Champagne. Good times.

(Whew! So snobby!)"}
{"text":"Let me say this: never have I gone to a brew-pub and felt comfortable ordering a burger medium-rare. Destihl has changed all that.

Destihl knows what they're doing. Great food, well prepared, attentive and quick service.

I would give them 6 stars, but my brother at my leftover half of Kobe burger without asking, and I associate that somewhat traumatic experience with Destihl."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I stop by here for the deep fried bacon, and another friend told me all the appetizers here are amazing. Since I got to come here with a large group from work, I got to try the cheese curds and the deep fried bacon. The cheese curds were above average and the deep fried bacon was really good. 

I was worried coming in that the bacon would be a grease bomb, but they executed it really well: thick cut bacon with minimal batter. The maple sauce on top was a nice touch. It came together to show off the delicious flavor of excellently prepared, thick bacon.

For my entree I ordered the cubano, which came with a side of picked cucumbers, onions, and maybe some vegetable I'm forgetting. The cubano was good, and these pickled veggies were amazing. They were perfectly tangy. I would come here more often except most of the time I go out to eat with my kids."}
{"text":"We were here over the weekend and its a really nice spot, we didn't really order food, except for some garlic bread which was cool. We went there for their beer since afterall, they are a brewery. $1.25 for 4oz beers....you can try close to everything they brew and then some. I had 6 and my bf had 5, our bill was just under $20. They had pumpkin ale, hefeweizen, chocolate cherry, coffee beer, IPA's...too many to remember, you'll have to check it out yourself. Can't wait to go back and maybe try some things on their menu. Fun bartender too, ask for Mike!"}
{"text":"Destihl (a play on De Stijl? no idea) is an inconsistently passable restaurant with a nice line of beers. They're also a brewery, if you're into that sort of thing, and my experience has been that the waitstaff are very helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to the stuff on tap.

So if you like the idea of a flight of carefully-selected brews and tasty (if not slightly overpriced) appetizers appeals, stop by.

Don't bother with sitting down for dinner. I've limped out of dinner here maybe five times in the past several years. Some reviewers described the food as 'delicious' (they are wrong); a few others as 'inconsistent' or 'not great' (correct). As a purveyor of hastily-prepared American slow food, Destihl is unremarkable, and the breadth of their menu probably suffices to describe the care that each dish has received. Some dishes are actually quite nice, if still too expensive, but you're unlikely to know which are worth your time unless you've got a secret decoder ring or something.

If you're looking to blow some cash on food downtown, think about what kind of food you really want. You're likely to get the same (or a similar) dish done better somewhere else. It's like a rich man's Applebees -- the food is better dressed and the ambience is less \"shopping mall,\" but your wallet hurts more than it should and your tongue is left just as wanting.

Oh, and if you ignore the rest of my advice, don't ignore this: don't get the big chocolate cake for dessert. It is the most over-sized lump of grocery store crap I've ever tasted. Its spot on the dessert menu is downright insulting."}
{"text":"Living in downtown Chicago & having great restaurants right outside our door, it's hard to get really jazzed about another restaurant. Unable to find anything like Distihl with it's interesting, well executed menu & drinks. We've come to expect a great meal at our visits but this time our server, Luis, was an extraordinary compliment to the overall experience with his fun personality & great suggestions. This is a great place to eat dessert first, banana cream pie is awesome and you'll want to have room for every delicious forkful!"}
{"text":"Despite seeming to serve vegetarian needs this place fails to be vegan friendly. You can get one entree and two partial meals that are vegan. They have a vegan burger with a non-vegan bun. Does that make sense on any planet? Same with the portobello sandwich. Crazy. 

The food is good but vegans don't bother. They don't get it."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food and service.  They were very accommodating for allergies.  I loved this place and I would return"}
{"text":"Legitimate spot for vegan/gluten-free food and local brews/craft cocktails.

Beer-battered asparagus = not gluten-free. I risked the intestinal distress, swallowed a GlutnGo pill and gave it a shot. Super delicious maple chipotle sauce! The asparagus stalks were thick and cooked to perfection.

Berries & Goat Cheese Salad (minus goat cheese) = vegan and gluten-free. I think this dish loses charm without the cheese because it was a bit flat. But next time I'll ask to add fresh red onion and that might kick it up a notch. Still, it's a good salad.

The Herbivore (veggie burger, minus mayo) = not gluten-free due to the wheat bun. Huge burger with a great patty, although I tasted just a little too much mint in it. Came with large, thick potato wedges. Great dish.

Sake lemon drop martini was sweet and refreshing. Maybe it's just my tolerance, but I would have liked it to be stronger.

Flight of beer (not gluten-free) including Drunken Weasel, I Believe You Have My Stapler, Roadblock Red Ale and a few others I've forgotten. I sampled each one (thanks to that GlutnGo pill) and they were all quite good. My favorite was the Drunken Weasel. I'm sure I'll visit this place again to re-sample and familiarize myself."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great. The bacon mac and cheese is amazing, and so is the jambalaya, meatloaf, pizza, pretzals, and fish and chips. Every dish I have had from here has been good! Would recommend, but they are usually pretty busy, especially on the weekend for dinner-- so make a reservation if you can!"}
{"text":"Beer battered asparagus is a many must! I had the yummy scallops and curried mash potatoes and my bf had the bonein rib eye....both were great! Our sever was friendly and knew the menu well."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in town. Was glad we were staying for the night so we could return. I wish I could try everything on the menu. Eating light tonight decided to both order the corn chowder which is the best we have ever had anywhere.  Our server Curtis was exceptional! So informative and helpful. Finished with their great carrot cake.  It is huge! Those at the front could have been a little bit more organized and friendly.  Love the atmosphere here too. Parking is free with validation...the attendant is not very helpful and hardly looks up from his cellphone to acknowledge someone entering.  We hope to return when in the area. again."}
{"text":"The waitress and hostess were super friendly.  Waitress recommended lots of options (her favorite salad, pizza, app, sandwich, etc) and beers. I went with a strawberry ale, cheese curds and the greekish salad.  The beer was excellent - fruity and light!  The cheese curds were great but the more you ate, the more blah you felt...share with someone!  The greekish salad was weird...it had a red dressing that I didn't like at all.  Bill came to $19.  A little pricey for lunch but not outrageous."}
{"text":"First of all, we got there at 2:50 and they told us we could only sit in the bar area at the high tables because they were going to having a shift change in about 15 minutes.  Other people had to wait also, they should seat people and have management pick up until waitstaff can.  Food was just ok.  We had the asparagus appetizer,  tasted good,  would be better with a spicy dip, the wait person never came back for us to ask.  I had the wagyo grass fed burger, was just ok, tasted funny to me.  Potato wedges were burnt , regular fries were good. I might go there again but would seriously think about it considering the cost."}
{"text":"I think this is the best valued food in champaign. Almost everything I've  ever gotten has been full of flavor and delicious- from pizzas to soup and sandwiches and great local meat entrees. Their beer is decent, nothing extraordinary, but they have other beer options besides their own."}
{"text":"Great place with an excellent menu!  We were sat near the kitchen and enjoyed viewing all of the wonderful dishes being served.  My husband said the beer battered bacon egg burger exceeded his high expectations.  I ordered the flat iron steak with asparagus and blue cheese potatoes.  Excellent flavor and Not a ton of food which is what I was wanting.  Kids enjoyed their meals, but it would be nice if they jazzed up the kids choices a bit."}
{"text":"good food, small portions.  Fairly over priced for what you get.  A little on the gourmet side as well.

All in all, i'd like to try more on the menu, i had the bbq glazed chicken and it was good, not great, thus only 3 stars for Distihl.

Would love to see some blackened items added to the menu, like a fish or a chicken."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this establishment about three times, today, for a family members birthday was the most disappointing experience. We ordered the pretzel appetizer which was overdone like last time. Then one member of our party wanted to order a pizza with pineapple which they have done every time we've eaten there, and the waitress said that she would talk to the chef but if they did it before it shouldn't be a problem. When our food FINALLY arrive, her pizza had a tiny amount of pineapples in addition to onion, when we filled the waiter in she said that was the mix they used for their burgers so it had to come with onions, which she did not disclose when ordering, if she had we would have ordered something else. thankfully, my daughter was not allergic to onions considering they didn't say the pineapple pizza would be coming with onions. Then the waitress seemed bothered by us pointing it out with an tone and irritated face. Then we tried to doa nice birthday desert for someone, and unlike any other restaurant they said they would only put a candle on a desert if we bought one and that they would not be singing happy birthday and it wasn't allowed. Cool thanks!!!"}
{"text":"The warm potato and salmon dish is delicious! I had a great dining experience with a group of friends at Destihl. Their menu includes various options for vegan, gluten free, and even the most carnivorous of diners which is difficult to find in one restaurant. I only wish that they were open later in the evening!"}
{"text":"OK so each time I have gone back to Destihl since my original post it has been better. I'd like to think someone over there read my posts ;) I'm still not a fan of the price points but the food is far more consistent and seems to be better quality. Also really enjoy their coffee and fresh cream after any meal there. Still nothing terribly interesting however everything seems fresh and well executed. Also I am trying to tone down on being such a food snob so... 4 stars!! (throws confetti sarcastically)"}
{"text":"I've not had the beer but the food is delicious! The warm caramel sundae is something straight out of heaven!"}
{"text":"Slow service, weak food, im not sure the beers we ordered had any alcohol in them they tasted watered down.  The place looks promising but I was dissapointed."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel across the street so this was a convenient place for dinner.  I got a reservation no problem.  I had the pulled pork and the fried cheese curds.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was ok beer was great. only had one appetizer that was a fried cheese curd. Outside was hot but inside was clod. Service was great"}
{"text":"Bloody Marys were great, stuffed dates were spicy yet delicious, Mango IPA yum! Wait staff worked together well. An exceptional experience for a first time visit!"}
{"text":"The best burgers ever! I've only been here for lunch and always get the Wagyu burger. I don't like my burgers to have a ton of stuff on them because I like to taste the meat. One: they know how to cook meat \"medium\" (it's still slightly pink and perfect). Two: the meat tastes AMAZING! Whatever they do this is probably some of the best meat I've tasted. Tasty beer (they brew their own plus it's not over-carbonated) and the service is really good. Usually I don't really care about service but all of the service we've gotten from this place is setting the bar. The servers actually know what they are doing and what they are serving--plus they're all good looking! I absolutely love this place. Remember to bring your growlers because you can also purchase some of that yummy beer for later."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful experience. Raul was our server and couldn't have been more helpful. Wasn't sure what to expect but our party of 6 all left very happy. Would go back again but our so graduated. Wish I had know about this great place and Raul sooner."}
{"text":"The positive:  The Aztec chocolate martini comes with a brownie garnish.  And it's spicy.  
The waiters and bartenders I've talked to have been incredibly friendly.
The food's better than you'd expect, actually.  The salad was good, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub.  The pizza's a little boring, but that's probably just the vegetarian ones I'm limited to.  They serve continuously, they have a large cocktail list, they take my American Express... it's everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub.
Except that's not really me so here's what I don't like.
The atmosphere.  As I read through the descriptions they say \"oh the atmosphere is great!\" and I say... are you at the same restaurant?  It's what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere.  Large, airy, and completely devoid of personality.  It matches Jim Gould's across the street very well actually.
The whole place really just reeks of chain, and I don't think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward.  I'm happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake.  (They actually inform me that it is an 11 pound cake split 10 ways, so slightly more than a pound!)

Worth checking out, if for no other reason than you too have probably been watching them work on this place for a couple years.  You can't NOT go."}
{"text":"Came here on a not so busy weeknight and tried their beer battered asparagus and their fried egg and bacon burger. Both were extremely delicious. It took a good minute for the burger to come out and I was stuffed from the asparagus for when it finally did. The asparagus was extremely tasty. The burger was very flavorful and I had leftovers which tasted almost as good the next day. Love that you can get 4oz of any of their beer- I forgot which ones I tried but can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Creative and delicious! Everything off the menu is incredible and beer selection is incredible! A wonderful place for both family night and date night."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Large interesting menu with many different things.  Love the stuffed poblano peppers!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere!  Have the weissenheimer chicken, shaved Brussels sprout salad and pumpkin bread pudding!  Delicious!  Fun place too!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! We came on a Friday night, probably one of their busiest. We called ahead for reservations (highly recommended) and only waited at the bar for only 20 minutes. The beer selection is wonderful and they taste great; I had the mango IPA and it was mind blowing!


Our server Aaron was incredibly professional and knowledgeable; he confidently and accurately described every item on the menu we asked about. 

I had the beer battered jalape√±o bacon and fried egg prime beef burger. Mouth orgasm! So good. 

My wife and her cousin were born and raised in this area. They proclaimed with confidence that this is the best restaurant in the area I couldn't agree more. Try this place!!"}
{"text":"Limited menu for vegetarians and overall a pretty unhealthy menu. It has a lively atmosphere which can be fun for groups, but if you have a large party I recommend booking the private party room so you can actually hear each other. This place is best for business meals."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and sat on the patio which was wonderful because there was a band playing on the corner. Our food was very good, but the best part was the coffee and dessert! Our waiter recommended the sour cherry bread pudding and it was awesome. Our waiter was great too. Despite them being extremely busy, he was very attentive and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the staff are great.
The only down side is the wait time.
I have been here four times now; during their on and off busy hours. I have had to wait at least 45 minutes for food everytime. Is it worth the wait? Eh.
The four times I came here were for date nights with my boyfriend and we have other events planned as well. With the time spent waiting at Destihl, we would usually miss our movie or a dessert place we planned to go to would close by the time we are done eating. I would rather go somewhere where the wait time is shorter and be able go some place elsewhere after dinner.
The food is delicious but not enough having to wait for it in my opinion."}
{"text":"went here twice, got pizza the first time, ribs the second. The pizza is quite satisfying and good if you order it, I would recommend that over the ribs. The ribs were kinda mediocre, but they were still decent, but not worth the price. 

Got a bunch of beers both times I went, they have rotating beers and home brewed beers that stay. None of them were that special.

It is a nice place though, waitress and atmosphere is more on the refine side."}
{"text":"Our server was super helpful (and patient) as we decided what beers we'd like for our flights. The standout for me was the white stout. I didn't even know such a thing existed! I think I'm in love. The food was a little baffling; for all of their \"boycott bland,\" I was a little befuddled as to how everything I tried was so...bland. The shrimp ceviche, the asparagus and lemon risotto, the salmon I added to it, even the lemon berry cream cake. I added salt and pepper, which helped, but I don't usually go out to eat and drop a bunch of money to have food that's just seasoned with salt and pepper. They have a lot of things on their menu that sound interesting, but when I weigh the risk with the price, maybe I'll just go back for beer and another one of their starters."}
{"text":"Great service! Couldn't even finish a drink before they had another on the table. 
Food was excellent!! I got the salmon and potatoes, my brother got the pot roast. 
We don't live in the area, stopped in on our way through town...it was out of the way but totally worth the extra time on the road. 
Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a beer flight and dinner last night, we loved it! The restaurant inside is very spacious and modern. Our server was incredibly nice and knew a lot about the beer selection, he was very helpful when we were picking our flights. We got flights of 5 each - they were very yummy and very inexpensive!! We then decided to split the bacon date pizza, which was nothing short of amazing. It was perfect for the two of us to split and had a great salty/sweet thing happening. Would definitely recommend that dish! Relatively inexpensive for yummy food and drink and great service. I will absolutely come back when I visit again!"}
{"text":"Brilliant. The staff was super friendly, the atmosphere was awesome, and the food was spectacular. I ordered the Thai fried chicken. It was literally a half a chicken on top of a bed of some yummy, spicy rice. I loved it. Ordered the fried asparagus for appetizer. The waitress was very informative and was spot on with suggesting the dishes. I absolutely recommend this place for first timers."}
{"text":"I don't know many people that like Destihl. I think it's a nice, relaxed place to go for different cuisine than you would find a chain restaurant plus they have some pretty stellar brews. The beer changes often, so don't fall in love with anything. I've had my heart broken more than once by their ever-changing menu. The plus side is I'm forced to try something new when they switch things up. Destihl is a nice spot to go to relax and have a drink. They have a small selection of small plates that are interesting and mostly good. I've never had bad service here and love the fact that they validate parking!"}
{"text":"We went here for my friends birthday and the food was very average. My friends had the fish tacos and claimed they were extremely dry. I had the veggie burger and it was also extremely dry. Overall the food lacked flavor and honestly aesthetic as well. Probably would not go here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Chicago and our friends from the area introduced us to Distihl.  It was a busy Saturday night and the service was a bit slow but given that we weren't in a rush, that was OK.  The food exceeded my expectations.  I had the Cuban sandwich and one of the better Cubans I've had in a long time!  My wife and friend both had a pasta dish which they enjoyed.  The waiter also was very knowledgeable about the menu and large number of beer choices, all of which were excellent too.  There are lots of choices in Champaign and I recommend anyone try Distihl!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was excellent.  Atmosphere was perfect for a nice evening out!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good ambiance ,  kids like the place and familiar menu choices. Excellent food presentation but sometimes food comes out a little bland and not as flavorful. Still, a good place to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is expensive but definitely worth it for a special occasion. Great appetizers and entrees. The mixed drinks are incredible - try the saki lemon drop martini, it's amazing. 
The service is great. The food is great. For celebrations, my first thought is always destihl."}
{"text":"Sadly I wanted this place to be 4 stars, but fell short based on the chicken and dumplings. Overly salty sauce with dry chicken. Beer selection was good and service was attentive."}
{"text":"My daughter had heard good things about Destihls, so we decided to give it a try.  We went on a Saturday night (12/1/12), so the place was pretty busy.  Fortunately, I was able to get a reservation through OpenTable via Yelp, so getting in was no problem.

When we arrived, we were seated within 30 seconds.  I appreciate that efficiency - we also saw several groups that tried the walk-in route - Lesson Learned - use the Yelp reservation system for fast seating!

We ordered the home-made chips for an appetizer, and they were great.  Very tasty, and a malt vinegar sauce, as well as a spicy sauce.

This place makes and serves it's own beer.  if you want a Bud Light, you'll have to go elsewhere.  If you want to try their beer, the prices are quite honestly, very low for good beer.  We tried their 4 ounce beers (I know, so small, but since you're trying a store brew, do I really want 16 ounces I don't like after one sip?) and for $1 and $1.50 (the price range of a 4 ounce beer), we got 2 beers that were very palatable and very good.

On to dinner. The menu ranges from sandwiches to steaks to pizza.

I ordered the 8 ounce Sirloin, medium rare.  The steak was cooked properly, more importantly, it was seasoned properly, and tasted great.  It was more tender than some fillets I have had recently.  A+!

My wife ordered a pork roast dish, that had pork so tender you didn't need a knife.  She really liked the dish.

My daughter went with the 8 ounce burger, and was very impressed.  She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to order.  She loved it.

My son ordered one of the pizzas, and was a little surprised when a large, thin crust pizza arrived (pleasantly surprised - he was expecting a lot less.)  The pizza was great.

We ordered desert, which included carrot cake (we ordered 1 piece for 2 people, and it was the right choice - very heavy, very good), along with S'mores and a Neopolitan fruit dish, all of which were very good.

The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is the noise level - the interior is nicely appointed, and very well done, but the acoustics are not very good.  Lots of hard surfaces result in a loud restaurant, where it was hard to hear our server.

We'll be back.  The entire ticket with tip was less than $110 for four adults."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and comes at a great price. For what I pay - maybe $10-$15 for a dish - I get a dish I would expect to cost closer to $30. Appetizers, entrees, and desserts alike are all delectable; I never have enough room in my stomach for all I want to eat. The restaurant has a nice in-between feeling, the sort of type where it could be dressed up or dressed down. I've been here before for brunches and lunch with friends as well as for slightly more formal dinner outings."}
{"text":"This restaurant has below average/overpriced food, and ridiculously slow service.. It took about 15-20 minutes for anyone to even notice us. We had to flag someone down just for some waters. I wouldn't say the servers did know what they were doing, but just very slow. For a Monday night, business was okay, but waiting 40 minutes for food is inexcusable. 

I had the Beer Battered Bacon Burger with an Egg, and it was below average. It would have been your average burger if the patty had any flavor.. But the meat was simply tasteless. The beer battered bacon is quite tasty, but the nothing I would crave for. 

The only reason I give this place two stars is for the Strawberry Ale that I got to try. The beer was light and smooth, it complimented my meal. 

I would go back to have a drink or two, but not for a dinner out with family or friends."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Champaign! Great for brunch, lunch and dinner. Also they have an amazing gluten free menu if that is something you're into."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my top 3 favorite restaurants around here! I haven't had a single dish here that I didn't absolutely love. The appetizers are super good also. The pretzels are SO freaking good, I love the mustard that comes with them even more than the cheese. Can't go wrong with their burgers and fries BUT if you wanna try something a little more \"Destihl\" the Chilaquiles was AWESOME! They put a nice twist on a traditionally hispanic dish, the goat cheese is a nice touch. The stuffed Poblano peppers are my girlfriends favorite! I also thoroughly enjoy the four cheese mac and cheese for a \"grown up\" dish from your childhood!"}
{"text":"Can you say BEER BATTERED BACON??!!!  Fried cod is to die for and Kobe burger is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Appetizers came a little late, but the owner made the apps on the house and personally delivered. Recommend the beer battered asparagus and poblano pepper entree."}
{"text":"In my opinion a good brewpub has great beer with good food to accompany the beer.  Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened, but of the 5 beer styles we got, 4 of them were \"off\".  One was clearly oxidized (badly), one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized.  We hoped the manager would come visit with us, but no luck.  The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day, the beer tastes different from the yeast.  First time I have heard of that.  Food was decent, but I have had better pub grub.  Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds.  

(Positive) The pizza is HUGE .  .enough for two to share or one very hungry person.

Hopefully they figure things out.  Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had.  Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that \"off\".  Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains."}
{"text":"Nice spot for drinks and food. Second time visiting this place. The first time I had a bad cold so I really couldn't enjoy the food. 
The brew is on point with a good in house selections. The mixed drinks are done very well; you can't go wrong with any of them. And the wine list is great; not many places carry Chenin Blanc and Cab Franc. Both of these wines are great!

The food was amazing especially the cheese curds and beer battered bacon. The flat iron was very good and I have had the pizza as well. The pizza was good but not great; stone oven but I was hoping for a more crispy crust. But it's still worth ordering. 

The deserts seemed very good but I have not tried them. But I'm sure you can't go wrong with trying them. 

Overall this is a very nice place with great ambience  and plenty of drink choices."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of taking out of towners to this place.  They have a variety of good dishes and a great list of homemade brews.  If you dig spice, I would highly recommend their stuffed pepper.  One is plenty of food.  However, if if you want another meal, you can capitalize on economies of scale and order two.  I think the second one is like 5 bucks cheaper or so.  

The restaurant is spacious and has a semi formal atmosphere.   Plus, they take reservations.  All the more reason it is good for out of towners."}
{"text":"Always happy when I go there. Great beer selection, great food selection, and great service. The only reason it's not 5 stars in my book is because the main dining room still kinda feels like a big chainy restaurant, and I'm more of a fan of independent ones."}
{"text":"My review is for today's visit. In town on business and Destihl was recommended. Service was very good as we fumbled through the beer and food menu.  I had the Hefeweizen, Jacobs ladder brown, and Roadblock red beers, all good.  Tried the battered bacon appetizer, perfect. So many great sounding entrees, I picked the pot roast - excellent. Very tender and tasty beef, gravy with vegetables on top of mashed potatoes. Excellent. Prices are reasonable. I wish we had this place in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Great beer great food and great service.  Check out the bottled selection as well as the draft.   Servers were awesome....thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"I just found out that Destihl doesn't have a dedicated fryer for their french fries and other \"gluten-free\" offerings. And they have stopped offering a GF menu. They were obviously trying to cater to the trendy gluten-free crowd, but not to Celiacs."}
{"text":"I'm very passionate about the stuffed peppers that come with chicken and/or chorizo and mashed potatoes. They're amazing. Warning: they're quite spicy, but I might think this because I paired this dish with a Bloody Mary last time which was also spicy. Either way, I enjoyed both and would order the same combo again. No regrets.

I love sitting on the patio when it's nice out. I once saw Jason Segel walk by during Ebertfest so that made for some exciting dinner conversation. Even when Jason isn't strolling by, there's a lot to look at and it's in a nice central, downtown location.

I've eaten here for brunch, lunch, and dinner and every time it rocks. 

Good to know: when it's someone's birthday, they bring out the cutest s'mores dessert dish (easy to share with friends! Or not). They also make amazing carrot cake."}
{"text":"Not too crowded at 12am on a weekend.
Found a table, whew, and the waiter was very helpful.  He knew quite a bit about drinks, their beers, and the menu.

He was attentive and answered all our questions patiently.  Patience is a virtue to a bar customer because time is money for them, and I get that.

The only thing I remember ordering was the deep fried bacon.  MMMMMMMM  It had a bit of spice to it and they were great...just taxing on the tummy 30 minutes after eating it.  Sooooo much grease - but aren't things better that way?

Lots of interesting menu choices and in house brewed beers (which I didn't have)
Hope you try them."}
{"text":"Loved the bacon dates appetizer! And the cheese curds.  I had the three cheese soup and the half of  Cuban sandwich and liked both.    The side house salad I ordered was fresh and had a light house dressing.  Some of  of our family had burgers and all were happy with the meal.  One of us had 
the Thai noodles and liked it.  We all shared pumpkin bread pudding with pecan ice cream for desert and it was delicious.  It is very clean and has a nice atmosphere.  Pretty reasonably priced for a family of 5!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday evening. Waited for 20 minutes when there was an abundance of open tables, my guess is they were short on wait staff that evening and wanted to keep the sections manageable. I won't fault them for that. I had the pot roast, it was very salty and the potatoes that accompanied it were a little clumpy. The portion size was average, kind of a bummer. We had the pretzel as an appetizer and it was great. But I mean come on it's just a pretzel, it would be pretty hard to mess that up. Service was okay, pretty quick to refill drinks, and the bill was affordable. I don't know this place screams average to me, I know there are other items on the menu that are probably worth writing home about, I unfortunately didn't have one of them. If you are in the area and you are looking for nice decor, not a chain, and moderately priced food this place should be on your list. Not great, but okayish to good."}
{"text":"Real good food along with exceptional service, good place for casual dining... Best of all were a trio of Beef Filets that were the best I have ever had, tender, flavorful, exceptional quality meat... Burgers were a hit with the kids who wrestled today.... Beer we tried were great! Service was top notch.. Very pleasant dining experience.. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After a long work day, my friend J and I needed some booze and sustenance... and she came up with yet another Champaign winner!

Interior is stylish, minimal and dark.  Our booth was large and comfy.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough.  Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks.

I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby, the dirty Martini.  My first one with organic corn vodka, which made for a smooth sipping drink.  Loved it.  J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.

We tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs).  The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper.  The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!

Next up, a la carte soup.  I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors.  J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here.  Both soups were wonderfully creamy.  Bowls were decent-sized for $5.

My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces).  Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish.  A bit of a disappointment.  J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge.  Perfectly pink pork.

We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full.  I would return and try everything new (other than my Martini)."}
{"text":"I love this place from the amazing food to drinks to beer to ambience. This place has it all. The people who work here are wonderful! Love this gastropub"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 7:30pm for a party of 3 and wasn't seated until 8:30pm with no apology from the host. We ordered fish and chips which came with literally only 5 potato wedges and the fish tasted off, almost as if it had sat out too long. The food was overpriced for what we received and I was disappointed at this whole experience. It was my first time here and I don't know if I'll ever return."}
{"text":"WOW- I am really surprised by all of the good reviews of this place!  I have been here twice- both times for lunch. The first time I went with colleagues and two of us ordered soup. It came out cold and had to be sent back. We ordered the cheese curds to share (nothing great) and I had the Chimi Chicken Torta; which was actually pretty bland. 

The second time I went, I ordered the Tomato and Bread salad with chicken. By the name of the salad, you would think it would have tomatoes on it right? I had two little pieces of a tomato, wilted greens, and a couple little tiny balls of mozzarella. Not acceptable. I asked the waitress for more tomatoes and mozzarella and after looking annoyed, she returned with more of each. 

I don't know what others are having that's so great, but I am very unimpressed with this place and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The first few times I dined at Destihl, I wasn't fond of it. I thought the food was too greasy and too salty. That was in regards to the the duck confit (which they don't offer anymore) and the salmon. The next few times I tried a greater of variety of dishes including the fish tacos and a couple burgers and a few appetizers (cheese curds and quesadilla). Excellent. Destihl has really grown on me."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place...I have to say, I was very disappointed. The only reason for a two star rating was the appetizers. We got the pretzels with beer cheese and the deep fried bacon. The pretzels were great, served warm. The bacon was...interesting, but tasty. That is where the goodness ends. I got a cheeseburger and asked for it to be prepared medium...I received a very dry and very well done bland burger with horrible over cooked yet cold potato wedges. The kids meals are ridiculously small and mediocre at best. To add insult to injury...we paid over $100 for a party of 5 (2 were kids meals) for over cooked and cold food. Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Only okay experience on graduation weekend. They had a lot of trouble managing the bigger crowd-- service was slow and the wait staff visibly stressed and distracted. The food wasn't great either. I ordered their very decadent-sounding french toast, but it was a bit dry and not especially flavorful... mostly just an eggy bageutte sliced into chunks. This was definitely the weakest of the restaurants we visited during the weekend, but I could see it being a nice place for some beer and burgers on a less crowded evening."}
{"text":"The rueben is awesome.  

The bison burger leaves much to be desired.  It has a very French flavor to it, which just doesn't seem right for bison at all.

The bourbons they have should be better than what they are carrying."}
{"text":"Husband and i went here for lunch. Nice atmosphere. Tables are close but not to close. Server was great and food was even better. I had fun trying a couple different beers. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably 15 times, and I've never left disappointed, or even mildly unsatisfied. Almost every dish I've had here was fantastic, with the ones that aren't fantastic being between very good and great. 

If you like soft pretzels, you have to order them as an appetizer. I've gone and picked up their pretzels with cheese and mustard sauce to go many times. 

The venue is great for casual dining or special celebrations. I've had great experiences in the dining room and sitting in the bar area. Spend some time looking over the beer menu. You won't be disappointed in that category either, I promise."}
{"text":"WHAT THE HECK IS THAT NASTY SMELL?

I'm not kidding.  I walked in the front doors today for lunch and would've turned around if I wasn't in a bit of a time crunch and needed to just order and eat already.  The entire restaurant smelled like somebody hid a bucket of crab legs and forgot where they put it......last week.  Just about the time you thought you might get used to it, you got another wave.  Can you give a negative star for ambiance, because EW.

My server today was super attentive and friendly.  I got there right at 12:30 and the hostess had to seat me in the bar area because the manager just cut ALL the servers in the restaurant section.  They CUT THE SERVERS AT 12:30?  Smack in the middle of lunch?  Who does that?  Fortunately, my bar server (he may have been bartender, too...I wasn't really paying attention to that) was great.  Many thanks to him for great timing on delivery of food and drink and immediate response when the kitchen screwed something up and getting my check out quickly.

I ordered a cup of the soup of the day--an Andouille gumbo--and a half Cuban sandwich.  The sandwich was fine--I've had that before and it's pretty decent for a Cuban in the Midwest, albeit very far from authentic!  But the soup.... there was a layer of fat floating on top of it and now three hours later my tummy is reminding me of that.  It was SO THIN that my first spoonful only brought up broth and a tiny piece of onion and a tiny piece of red pepper.  I asked my server if there was supposed to be rice and he said HECK YEAH and came right back with a tiny ramekin of rice to at least give it a little body.  I finally found a few little cubes of sausage, but suffice it to say that this is NOTHING even close to the gumbo you find anyplace that actually knows how to make it.  I kinda feel like I need to give them my recipe that came straight from my crazy little cajun friend.  Say it with me TASSO HAM, ROUX, TONY CHACHERE'S SEASONING....and don't be so stingy with the sausage!

This is the first time I've been back here in about a year, I would say.  I always really wanted to like this place.  The interior is cute.  I like that they brew beer.  But the food has never been above a hearty meh for me.  I've had so many food issues here--there was the time that I ordered the reuben 1/2 sandwich and soup that literally had ZERO meat on the sandwich and the time the chicken was served raw and the time they forgot to put the primary ingredient on the pizza....  The only reason I came was for the amazing and entertaining service. They cleaned house a year or so ago and all the really good professional servers were gone. (And I know that they did this in a less than classy way...)  Based on today's experience, they still don't have their act together in the kitchen.  And the menu hasn't changed one iota in a year's time, so nothing new is calling my name.

Maybe I'll try them in another year.  Maybe.  There are far too many options in CU to waste my time and money here.  It's a shame to squander the best location in town."}
{"text":"Great place for your family.  The beer battered bacon is tremendous."}
{"text":"Coming from the LA and OC area I was skeptical about how good some of the food in C-U would be in comparison. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the food and drink here. 

Service was extremely good and attentive. Our server recommended the salmon and potatoes and my god that was a great recommendation. Central Illinois isn't where you expect to find good seafood but the dish was cooked to perfection. Grilled salmon, roasted vegetables, and fingerling potatoes all tied together in a wonderfully light mustard dressing.

I also had the Cranberry Criek Sour and Synchopathic Apricot Sour which were both extremely good. One thing I appreciated was that beer was priced the same per ounce regardless of size, meaning you can taste more of their selection without paying more.

Will definitely be back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"One of the classiest establishments Champaign has to offer. I come here at least once a week for work or events. They have a diverse menu that should please most people. I'd recommend the skirt steak, Dijon chicken, or burgers. The salmon is very popular with my colleagues as well. They also have a rotating drink list that always seems to offer something new and unique.  They take reservations and it usually a good idea, especially on a weekend. 

If you have space in your diet their appetizers are wonderful (bacon wrapped dates!) also for dessert the chocolate cake is worth a bite (then take it home to eat later)."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating, and I love that you can see where they brew all the beer.

I tried the Hefeweizen and really enjoyed it. I was amazed at how large their menu was. They had a great variety with lots of vegetarian options.

I ended up trying the veggie burger. Overall, I've had better - but it was still very good. And the fries that came with it were awesome. I would recommend it but if I came back I would probably try something else. 

I knocked off a star because our service wasn't great. Our server was also the bartender so he was pretty busy, but still. 

Overall I was very pleased and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in CU.  The food is always interesting and delicious. Staff is friendly.  We got the beer battered asparagus and that was amazing.  I like their pizzas."}
{"text":"Love the athmosphere.  Plenty of craft brews on tap.  This is a nice place to take a date or have a business meeting."}
{"text":"BEST. CARROT. CAKE. EVER.

One of the few places in Champaign I like going to more than a few times. Never tried their beer because I don't drink beer, which is a shame since their food's good so I bet there are some great pairings! 

Their croquettes, like most fried stuff IMHO, is okay. The stuffed poblano was really nicely done, and has some serious stuffing! The swordfish tacos are amazing; just look at the line up of flavours on the menu! 

I avoid eating pastas in most places, but the orrechhiette and fennel sausage one is great. Always love flavoured sausages, and while I'm not sure this is house-made, it's still a great dish. And even when you re-heat it, except for the kale bits of course :) Their stuffed pasta is good too, but not as much."}
{"text":"Came to destihl for brunch (have been several times for dinner), and they do not disappoint. Started off with beer battered bacon as an appetizer with a delicious Bloody Mary. The brunch menu is small but the frittata and French toast we are were delicious! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Destihl, but unfortunately the experience fell a little flat. My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.

We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.

I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.

We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.

Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware."}
{"text":"Destihl is one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign. Their current appetizer special, Thai style chicken wings, is one of the best things I've ever eaten. I hope they'll add it to their menu permanently! I love trying their rotating feature menu and beer list. It's always a tough choice if I want to try something new or go with a classic. Its a win either way. The stuffed peppers and the rest of their house specialties are all just stellar.  The sake lemon drop is awesome, as are their mimosas and other signature cocktails. Really, everything on their menu is great. I love coming here."}
{"text":"To be honest the food was pretty good. I got the chorizo stuffed dates, which was the best thing I had tonight. For my entree I got the wagyu burger, which was overall pretty good. However this is the point at which their rating goes down. 

The wagyu burger is advertised as coming with a \"golden brioche bun\", but the bun we received looked like the average bun you get at Walmart for a picnic; thin, flat and crumbling. We asked the waitress if there was some mistake but she confirmed that, indeed the bun we received was the \"golden brioche bun\". Either the waitress was mistaken, or this restaurant does not know what a brioche bun is. I guess it's also possible that I have no idea what a brioche bun should look like. I uploaded a photo of the bun if you guys want to see for yourself."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant that works to accommodate their customers and make sure all are well fed. I enjoy the beer battered bacon it is worth the trip all by itself. A great selection of beer and microbrews. I have had the jambalaya and swordfish the times I went both were descent. Swordfish was a bit dry. It's a good atmosphere on the weekends. A bit dead during the week. All in all a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Appetizer of cheese curds with a smoky garlic red sauce were good...very flavorful. Our 2 1/2 year old enjoyed her yummy PBJ and we were especially appreciative of the fact they offered seasonal fresh fruit as an option. The nice size bowl included mandarin and Sunkist oranges, Apples and strawberries. She also loved the corn and chicken chowder and ate half of her Daddies. My husband ordered the black rye IPA and the red ale. I ordered the porter. We enjoyed them all. Along with the cup of soup, my husband and I shared a half havarti and turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread. The avocado was very fresh and the basil pesto mayo was good too. Our waiter, Tanner was sweet and efficient. The booth was big and comfy. Overall we very much enjoyed lunch here."}
{"text":"Better reserve a table 6 months in advance if you ever want to eat here. Completely empty on Saturday at 5, but no tables for 45 mins to an hour so byyyyeeee."}
{"text":"Nice kinda classy place that has food. You could wear a tie and not feel out of place, but I'm in khakis and a t-shirt and still feel comfortable. We're just ordering beer samples and Curtis is taking care of us nicely. Not a bad blow off Monday workday kind of place."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I ordered a flat iron steak and mashed potatoes. All was great. Our server was great and knew the menu well. The reason I gave four instead of five is the price to food ratio. You don't get a whole lot of food for the price but to be expected as its a \"trendy\" restaurant. Would recommend and will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went here for din-din with my broey and his wifepoo since they live in the area.  Food was fantastic!  Service was spot on - our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us.

We had a flight of the many beers they offer, the menu is extensive and it's hard to decide.  But one thing is 1000% worth getting:  Beer Battered Asparagus.  That's it.  Who cares if you have stinky pee from eating asparagus - totally worth it."}
{"text":"Super excited this place is finally open.  Not only that, but it was just as good as I had hoped it would be.  Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way.
The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza.  Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler.  This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome.  Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming.  It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears.  I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here.

Now for the mega good stuff:
Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had.  It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied.  Just wonderful!  Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;)  The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye.  Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open.  The people getting bad service in the other review...sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;).  

We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day.  Which was even. more. amazing.

Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin.  The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome.  Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else.  It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice.  Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :)

Awesome place guys!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Out of the Pilsner but the Champaign blonde is FANTASTIC!  Jambalaya was a bit too spicy for me. I'm embarrassed to say but true. Service was excellent. They went above and beyond everywhere."}
{"text":"Great area of town for this spot. Waited 20 minutes for a table on a Tuesday night at 8pm. Well worth it. I ordered the gaucho skirt steak and it was much more than I expected. I wouldn't have thought to put a steak on a bed of rice with a jalapeno on top but I would 100% order this amazing dish again. Just the right amount of spice. Made complete with the synchopathic sour beer, which had the perfect tartness to it. We split the Smores dessert and, though I wished it came with more chocolate, it turned out to be the top off that we needed."}
{"text":"Really really nice place. My son in law had a celebratory party here for my daughter, party of about 20.  The servers were wonderful, they never left us alone to wonder about anything at all but they weren't hovering which was nice.  The food was excellent!  The menu was explained thoroughly, the drinks were yummy and not weak. 

I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'd come back here is for the bacon wrapped dates!  Those babies embodied sweet, savory, smokey, and spicy.  Delish!  Omg, I just realized that delish is almost an anagram for Destihl.  So shall I say it was delisht*?

Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return.  Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).

- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order.  Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. 
- Long wait for the appetizers.  How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos?  The nachos arrived last.  I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes.  I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.
- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well.  I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.

And the last and final straw:
- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings.  He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees.  Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and \"the wings tasting good?\"  That is actually the first time in life that I've seen an entree get messed up, and it's still charged on the final bill.  Wth?  I spoke to a manager, who removed the item from the bill.

*the t is silent.  Duh!"}
{"text":"I've been to this resturant three times each time fantastic. Service is friendly an upbeat becase the waiters are extremely nice and helpful. It is modern yet comfortable. Food looks and tastes like it's from a high class resturant but not overpriced with big portions. Go here!

Went in a large group and got a private room in the back. Great for big gatherings or when you want to try a new place. Beer is good too and you can take samples before buying a glass

I'd give food recommendation but I swear it's all delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to Destihl a handful of times, and every time I am disappointed. The restaurant decor is very modern and the menu is impressive - often offering delectable-sounding dishes and impressive combinations. 

That said, you may be disappointed upon arrival of your meal. The presentation is beautiful, but the taste is so bland. The first time I had a featured soup and sandwich - both just okay. The second time, I had their Rancher burger, which was wayyy overcooked (I asked for medium-rare and got very well done) and the fries were pretty bland. Some words about leftovers from Destihl: you don't want them. They are terrible as next-day meals. 

Overall, you'll have better luck for your taste buds and wallet by making a trip down the street to Dublin's."}
{"text":"Destihl, Destihl, Destihl. Their food is just bad. So bad. I gave them two chances and I just could not ever do that again. The beer/cheese soup is a salty, goopy mess. The blue cheese and steak quesadilla would have been edible if it wasn't absolutely sopping wet with oil. The burger is bland and if you're lucky (note my sarcasm), you'll get a few nice, chewy chunks of fat in there. I got some kind of s'mores dessert and it was a cheap mess. How can you make a bad s'mores dessert??? It's cruel! Their menu is so awesome, but they're SUCH a tease! They cannot execute anything well. I gave them two stars: one, for the selection in the menu and the other, because I haven't had any beer here and it is kind of a brewery I guess so I can't judge them there. Also, people seem to like their deep-fried bacon, but I personally cannot bring myself to put something like that in my body, but then again I did eat at Destihl TWICE *facepalm*

Oh, Destihl. How badly did I want to love you, but you were not willing."}
{"text":"Oh, Destihl. How I wish you were anything above average. 

I had a delicious brunch at Destihl once (while sitting outside) and it ruined me for life, because for that reason, I feel compelled to keep giving the place a chance at serving me a delicious indoor dinner that's worth the price tag. So far, that just hasn't happened, or even come close. 

I might join friends here for dessert or for drinks and an appetizer, but I've learned my lesson with dinner. I think."}
{"text":"I loved the food and beer selection.  I only wish there were more vegetarian options.  It won't keep me from going back, but I won't go as often as I might if there more veggie-friendly choices:)"}
{"text":"We like to go around sampling the different vegetarian options in town, especially veggie burgers. This one is probably the best restaurant style veggie burger in the C-U area. IT is different from the normal black bean burger, although they have that as an option too. It is by no means the best veggie burger I've ever had, but one of the better ones in the area. They also have some tasty beer-battered asparagus sticks. If you're looking for a heavy meal, than this is a good place to go, but they definitely don't do light n healthy..."}
{"text":"Have dined at Destihl 3 times and have enjoyed the food every time. I highly recommend reservations. On this visit, we were seated right away while a walk-up couple was told it would be a 30 min wait. The lobby area was busy with people waiting to be seated.

Started with the Potato Croquettes, which had a nice flavor to them. Also sampled 3 of the beers...really enjoy the 4 oz options so I can try a few different varieties.

We were satisfied with our entrees...a pork tenderloin special and the flat iron steak. Great flavors and cooked the way we ordered.

Best part is probably dessert. The smores are a fun, gooey mess and the cherry bread pudding was tasty.

We dined on a Saturday night, which was also prom night in the area and a busy sports night (we were seated in the bar area), so it was a bit noisy. However, Destihl is a good dining option in the CU area."}
{"text":"I love Destihl! We had wonderful service. Our waitress recommended the nachos for an appetizer and they were wonderful. Beware of huge portions! Then I had a stuffed poblano pepper. Who would ever think to put mashed potatoes in there?! It was heavenly! I'd go back in a second and get the exact same meal, except with a bigger appetite!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and came here with a small group. Nice location in downtown. The beer selection was OK, but nothing stellar - and one of the beers I got was on the warm side. The ambiance was nice, and it was quiet enough to make it easy to talk with the rest of the table, even though a world series game was on and it was pretty crowded. The food was just mediocre. The fries (which were recommended as a side) were tasty, but a bit soggy. I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty, but the amount of meat was pretty small - it was a thin cut (probably half a breast pounded flat) and I ended up peeling away half the bun, which was twice as big as the cut.

My friends seemed to like their food (burger, bacon-wrapped dates), but I don't think they would give it more than 2.5 or 3 stars either. I gave it 3 stars because the prices were OK, but I'm used to California prices - so this might be more the norm for Champaign."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! I go here regularly with friends and family and enjoy the artistry and care put into the making of the food and craft beer. I also highly appreciate that the food ingredients are locally sourced. I've never eaten something at Destihl that I didn't love!"}
{"text":"You literally can't go wrong with Distihl. The food is top notch, the service is sublime and the drinks go above and beyond. The only thing you do have to be aware of is that EVERYONE knows it's great - so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Of all the nicer restaurants in the downtown champaign area, this is one of my favorites. Most of the food choices are excellent and I can see how the ones I didn't like all that much would appeal to others with different palettes. I'm not much of a beer drinker but friends I've been with have told me it is great. Acceptably priced given the ambiance and portions. My go to for a nice sit-down dinner in the New-American cuisine."}
{"text":"I keep revisiting Destihl because it's easily agreed upon among friends. The food is generally good. The beer can be hit (they once had an incredible Mango IPA) or miss (see below). Ambiance is dim but beautiful - nice for a date, bad lighting for photography. (Why are you taking selfies on a date anyway?) For this occasion, the Bacon & Cheddar Burger ($11.25) was a yes. A hefty hunk of meat nestled in a brioche bun with melted cheddar and a cross-hatch of semi-crisp bacon. Accouterments included the requisite lettuce, tomato, and thin-sliced pickles (which I think really give burgers that extra layer of flavour). I asked for medium-rare and got just that. The side of fries were fab: hand-cut and lightly seasoned. The Oengus Irish Stout (Nitro, starts at $1.40 for 4 ounces) was a no. It tasted like dirty water with a hint of coffee in the postlude. The brown ale might have been better if you enjoy dark & bitter with a bit more complexity. Our waiter was a maybe. He was courteous and lovely and kept our water glasses filled. He claimed he has a good memory but forgot my beer along with that of my companion's. And his rave recommendation of the Oengus Irish Stout seemed like false advertising. Though it doesn't have much to do with the food, he also had great hair imo. Maybe that bolstered our dining experience."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, especially the bun. The fries were really good as well. Drinks were just okay. (Not anything special or mixology)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. It was noisy, but we were seated in a booth which isolated us from a lot of the noise and felt intimate. Our kids loved the kids menu and spent most of their time coloring it in and playing the games. The chicken tenders and fries they ordered tasted great. We also ordered a Bavarian pretzel appetizer which came with really good spicy mustard and cheese for dipping. My wife and I ordered a bunch of four ounce pours of their different beers. We liked every beer we tried, especially the Clarice Belgian Strong and the Roadblock Red. I ordered the Brewster pizza, which was fantastic and my wife ordered the salmon and potatoe which was also great. Our server was very nice as was everyone we interacted with while there. This place was great."}
{"text":"The Hubster and I decided to do a date night--try out Destihl and then go see The Exorcist at the Virginia (our date night may not be your definition of 'romantic,' but that's neither here nor there).  I'd heard about how crowded Destihl gets around dinnertime, and never having been there before, I went the AARP-route and reserved a table for us at 5:15 to give ample time for slow service (this was unnecessary).  I was surprised to learn that Destihl is cavernous.  There was absolutely no shortage of tables.  How does it ever get crowded?  Who knows?  In any case, we were (irritatingly) seated near the only large, loud party in the entire restaurant.  Nothing like listening to a bunch of screechy teenagers dressed up for Homecoming say semi-racist things and then shush each other on date night!

We got appetizers and small plate-y things to constitute our meal.  All were finger food, all were messy and delicious.  We tried the cheese curds (lightly breaded, crunchy, thoroughly melty), thai chicken wings (a nicely spicy slow burn, flavorful, thick sauced with fabulous peanuts sprinkled over the top), and beer-boiled shrimp (a tad too much seasoning that clung to our fingers and overwhelmed most other flavors, not much beer taste, but otherwise...you know...cold shrimp are tasty on their own).  I tried a pint of their black IPA which I thoroughly enjoyed.  

We also shared their chocolate trio (or M√©nage √† Trois or whatever they call it), which consisted of mexican hot chocolate (thick, hot, nom), a chocolate tart (delicious filling, but with a crust that was absolutely impossible to cut into, making it awkward to eat, much less share), and zanzibar chocolate ice cream (heaven).  

I need to try more things to be sure that this is actually a problem, but I feel like everything on their menu is too complicated.  There are SO MANY INGREDIENTS listed on every single menu item.  Too many seasonings, too many flavor combinations.  Every time I read something, I was like, \"Mmm...yes...yes...yes!...oh, no, you went too far.\"

Our waiter was extremely enthusiastically friendly to the point of making us feel a bit awkward.  I mean, he hung out and chatted.  I don't harbor ill will against the guy or anything--he was really nice!--but you know...I'm on a date with my main squeeze...please leave.

Considering all the stuff we got, our tab was surprisingly cheap.  I think we were out for under $30.  I waffled between 3.5 and 4 stars, but I'm feeling generous today."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but the beers are bland.  They have no body.  We didn't eat any food but it looked good.   The chef must be good because the beers are aweful"}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant! Ordered the Ruben egg rolls to start and it just continued to be amazing through our dinner! BBQ chicken pizza and fish and chips were really yummy!

Update* went last night and had the stuffed poblano peppers and the wagyu burger and the carrot cake .... All were to die for! I don't like stuffed bell peppers and I cleaned the plate with the poblanos! Well done desthil!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day dinner the Monday after. Was impressed with the decor, menu, service, and food. Our service was excellent. I had a Flat Iron Steak and fingerling potatoes w/blue cheese. Steak was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were tasty.

Other people in our group were satisfied with their choices. (We tasted each other's dishes to verify the deliciousness.) Portabella burger, veggie burger, American Kobe burger, chipotle shrimp skewers, & chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were their choices. We had two appetizers - cheese curds & tempura-fried asparagus. Yum, yum.

One of our dessertw was the highly-promoted banana cream pie. Good, but the bananas were over caramelized. (waiter apologized).

All in all we were very happy with our experience. I hope to take other people to share the Destihl experience."}
{"text":"We've been to Destihl maybe six times now, for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. 

The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.

For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a \"small plate\") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.

The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was.  I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. 

Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene."}
{"text":"My husband and I met my mom and daughter for lunch here. We ordered cheese curds for an appetizer. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my husband ordered a pizza. The chicken pot pie was awful. I'm ok with changing recipes up a bit but not only did it have very different vegetables that were so undercooked they were almost raw, the flavors did not even resemble a pot pie. My daughter had gotten there after we had ordered and she order the pot pie, until she tasted mine and then we canceled the order and she ate some of my husband pizza. The pizza wasn't bad but nothing to crow about either. I don't think I would go back with all of the other food  choices out there. Waitress was friendly, cheese curds were ok."}
{"text":"Happy Valentine's Day! Came here for a lovely lunch with my boyfriend and it didn't disappoint. The creamy tomato soup and ham&dapple sandwich was very good. My boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits which he very much enjoyed but said the portion seemed a little small with only 1 biscuit. The chocolate cake was very good and moist. The only thing I was Unsatisfied with was the drunks, the island cooler was very sour and almost bland. As well as the cream soda concoction it was bland and flavorless. Overall a good dining experience for this romantic holiday!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection - especially if you like sours! They have a pretty diverse and creative menu. I had the vegan zucchini pasta - so good and not too filling (must save room for beer). The side salad I ordered had great beer vinaigrette, but it was mostly cilantro (yuck!) Our waiter basically knew nothing about beer which was comical since it's a brewery, but he was nice all the same. Overall this is a cool spot, and I'd go back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my family and friends and have always had a good experience. The staff is friendly, the food is great, and the ambiance is nice. I started making reservations since there is often a wait, but even if you decide to just come in on a whim, it's well worth it. 

I've tried at least 8 different dishes and have truly enjoyed each one. The menu has good variety, including vegan, gluten free, and vegetarian options. 

I really encourage you to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Their jambalaya is incredible. It's probably not what you would think to go here for, but it's absolutely worth it. I tried a bison burger once too, and was underwhelmed. It was kind of expensive, dry, and the toppings that came with it reminded me more of a health food salad than a burger. The beer selection is great, and they make some of them in-house, which is cool.

The interior is classy, clean, and modern, and the staff were always friendly. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for a nicer sit-down restaurant in Chambana."}
{"text":"I love the Destihl in Bloomington-Normal so I had to give this one a try.  A co-worker and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  The place was not overly busy but had plenty of business.  I really liked the decor of the place and the booth setup was neat.  Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.

I was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington-Normal with only their beer selection being different.  We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious!  I was tempted to get my usual, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit.  I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout.  It had wonderful flavor!  My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too.  We decided to go for dessert as well.  I ordered the Creme Brulee.  I was not very impressed by this.  It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy.

Overall, great food and service!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a large group.  I thought the menu selections were unique and gourmet.  We ordered the Fried Asparagus and they were lightly battered and fried to perfection.  Delicious.  My friend is Gluten Free and they have a menu just for GF items....she had some type of pizza that looked and tasted delicious.  We didn't have any alcohol it was a work lunch, so I can't speak to that."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Pesto pizza and the skillet nachos are to die for! Husband and I always go here for date night. Quiet enough to talk and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Located in a nice part of downtown Champaign. The interior had a dimly-lit, classy ambiance to it. We were a party of over 20 people and got a side room with huge windows. Service was great considering how many people we had! 

[Cheese Curds] They reminded me of mozzarella sticks except bite-sized. The cheese was well breaded and the tomato sauce was spot on. Considering that this was an appetizer, the portion size was pretty hefty.

[Squash & Cashew Cream] I enjoyed the creaminess of the cashew cream that coated squash pasta. The variety of vegetables in the dish was impressive. The herbs and spices added a light flavor to the dish. However, the overall flavoring was sort of bland. Perfect for someone looking for something really light."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have loved everything I've had. I highly suggest the pretzel appetizer. They are hot and fresh every time. The dipping sauces that come with it, one cheddar cheese sauce and one honey mustard type sauce are both great too.

The charred broccolini salad is delicious. I also recommend the herbivore burger if you like veggie burgers. It is huge though so be prepared to share with someone or take half home. The cedar plank salmon is also very good and comes with grilled vegetables and a nice arugula salad. The salad was a bit too overdressed for my taste so request it to be lightly dressed if you don't like a lot of dressing.

As far as dessert goes I've tried the cherry bread pudding, s'mores, chocolate cake, and the wild sour berry tart and out of all of those I would recommend the tart and the chocolate cake. They give you a pound of chocolate cake so only order it if you are not already stuffed from your meal or if you want to take it home. Half of it was more than enough for 4 of us."}
{"text":"The sours are DESTIHL's specialty for sure.  Stick with 'em and you'll enjoy your drinking experience!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, food and plenty of unique twists to make it as interesting as anything else within 50 miles. Had a great time here and enjoyed very good service in this trendy looking place."}
{"text":"5/5 stars!!!

I completely agree with Jeffrey T., everything was on point from start to finish.

Four of is dined here at about 5:30pm on Saturday. There was a bit of a wait, but totally worth it.

Great atmosphere. Comfy couches in the waiting area. You can peruse the souvenirs while you wait. 

We were seated in the bar area which turned out to be great. Not noisy and very family-friendly.

The gentleman that seated us (front of house manager? General Manager?) was wonderfully nice and our dining experience only got better from there! Our waiter, Tanner, was outstanding. Probably one of the best waiters I've ever had; very attentive, accommodating and he was able to answer questions about the food. I'd say Desthil does a superb job of training their employees, but I have a feeling they only hire the best to begin with.

Food was delicious. I had the stuffed poblano pepper and hubs ordered the coulette steak. 

Our bill was just under $100 for four adults (pre-tip). This included several 12 oz. beers, Bavarian pretzel appetizer and four entrees. Would love to try some desserts next time.

I really enjoy their Sour beers.

Great food and there's something for everyone, even the non-beer drinkers. Prices are great.

I love that Desthil represents a melting pot of people. From babies to grandparents and everyone in between.

Free, easy to find parking on the street about 1/2 a block away.

We'll be long-time customers!"}
{"text":"My personal favorite restaurant at Champaign. Why? In my opinion, they provide the best combination of quality food, craft beer, atmosphere, and reasonable prices. 

The food I've had here has been consistently exceptional. I've had the skillet nachos, cedar plank salmon, jambalaya, bbq pork two-ways, pot roast, Thai fried chicken, and poblano peppers. The Thai fried chicken and pablano peppers were particularly noteworthy and I strongly recommend both for those who enjoy zesty food. 

The beer is well-rounded and contains great choices for ipa's, sours, and others. The best part is the option to buy 4oz flights for 1/4 the price of a regular pint. You can buy 4 flights for the same price that you'd buy a pint and can mix and match all you want. 

The tables are also very spread out and the interior is dim lit with good decor. Includes a bar area for drinks and big screens for games."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Always enjoy stopping into Destihl when I come through Champaign!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! This will be my regular spot when I'm driving through Champaign. We chose this place because there seemed to be vegetarian options and I am so happy we did! We arrived on a Friday evening, which was a bad idea because the wait was like 45 minutes.The restaurant seems separate from the bar and waiting area, which was nice because it was quiet where we ate. It seemed family friendly as a result. There was really good energy in the place.I really enjoyed the atmosphere, which made the wait a bit easier. 
I ordered a cold brew coffee and cream and my date ordered a weissenheimer beer. He lived in Germany years ago and was struck by the flavor of the beer. It reminded him of the days back in Germany. My cold brewed coffee was delicious, as well. I ordered the stuffed poblano pepper and he ordered the blue cornmeal trout. They didn't take long to bring out the food which was surprising seeing as though it was very crowded. The pepper, came with a roasted red pepper sauce and ancho rice and beans was superb! The pepper was charred and had just enough heat to make the tongue tingle, but was still very flavorful. The fish meal was a delicate combination of andouille sausage hash and greens (with pork) over top of the fish with some kid of gravy that pulled it all together. My date enjoyed it immensely. We both cleaned our plates and still ordered dessert! If you follow my reviews, you don't hear me speak about desserts or sweets much, but I have a weakness for bread pudding and they had it on the menu. Sour cherry bread pudding was heavenly (I hate that we decided to share). It was too sweet and the cherries added the right amount of umph. This bread pudding was fluffy enough that it wasn't doughy but dry enough that it remained moist. Perfecto! We walked around the small downtown area after dinner to digest some of the food and was impressed with the variety of bars and restaurants that were in the small area. Like the Terminator said, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Relaxed casual atmosphere with wonderful upscale food. The beer was good, the food was great. I would return if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant unreservedly! Service is excellent, but not intrusive or obsequious.  Food is wonderful-salmon, chicken, burgers, all were well prepared and unfailingly delicious. The atmosphere is attractive and upbeat. Definitely one of the best restaurants in s restaurant- 'saturated town!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with excellent food and beer.  Great choice of seating, bar, inside or outside."}
{"text":"All right, so I've now been to both locations of Destihl and I have to say they're both pretty good, not stellar but a slightly above average brewpub. I tried their Hawaii five ale which was okay-it was a fruit beer that was supposed to remind me of being on a beach in Hawaii. Well, anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale. They didn't have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing. 

I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. 

I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good. The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat  but the fries were actually quite tasty.  Overall, it's still an okay place"}
{"text":"SLOW SLOW SLOW.. food is fine but the service is way too slow.. my kids will not go there.."}
{"text":"Had the steak, asparagus, and potatoes. The steak was just a steak with some butter, salt and pepper--nothing outgoing. The asparagus was under-cooked, but not bad. The potatoes were delicious though!"}
{"text":"Great almosphere, drink choices, and food.  Comfortable for a group or a romantic night out."}
{"text":"Yum! Original and fun gastro pub food. Great atmosphere. Best place I have eaten at U of I."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is exceptional. Most dishes are above average to excellent. Beers are usually decent. The saison i had recently was outstanding and so drinkable. Nice soft fruit profile with a hint of fall spice. Idk what people below have been ordering, but I've yet to be disappointed. Probably skip the pizzas just because there are better pies elsewhere. The trout and salmon are great, goucho steak is good, the cuban and the other pork sandwich are solid, the bison burger is perfect, salads are solid too. Get the fried green tomatoes, ceviche, or Bavarian pretzels as appetizers. Dessert-wise, the lemon berry cream cake is to die for! Like the perfect middle ground between angel food cake and pound cake, with a touch of mascapone. So moist! Really, can't comprehend the hate. Also the person slamming them for no vegan options... lol ok"}
{"text":"Nice selection of on premises brewed beer and a good menu with a broad selection of choices."}
{"text":"Staff - amazing.
Food - outstanding.
Beer - terrific.

'nuff said.

I did have the Brewmasters Pizza, roadblock red and the Belgian Trippel.  Recommend them all."}
{"text":"We had the best food and service ever. We are in for a wedding. Otherwise I'd be here every single day. If you get down here, this is a must go to!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place often and it was very good! But I went last night at around 9:30 PM and was highly disappointed by the service and food. I understand that it was a Friday night and it was busy but I expected much better service and better quality food. For instance, the fries that came with the sandwich I ordered were soggy, not fresh, and it appeared that they were sitting in the kitchen for a long time. To add to to my night, the waiter was not very friendly and dry! But at the same time I was impressed with the presentation of the food. Overall, I was very upset about my visit and do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place- I go here for lunch all the time.  It's close to my office and they offer a nice variety of food choices."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I never have high hopes in the Midwest for finding things I can eat besides salad, but DESTIHL had a handful of vegan options and the veggie cashew pasta was actually pretty good! The non-vegans I was with were less enthused by the options though."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by the concierge at my hotel but failed to deliver. Atmosphere was great and so was the service. 
The food, however, was disappointing. I had a steak spinach salad. The steak was cooked perfect. The spinach tasted dirty and the dressing it came with was weirdly sweet so it didn't pair well with anything else on the plate. Table ordered fried asparagus which tasted exactly like fried asparagus *shrug*.
I asked for a side of their pickles since they make them in-house and they were the highlight of my meal."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Nice bar with a great selection of their beers. I particularly like the Nut Brown Ale but there are several other styles to choose from. As for dining, we love Destihl. This time we had the Reuben Egg Rolls which were excellent. I had the Chicken Corn Chowder which was one of the best I've ever tasted. For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!"}
{"text":"Dishes can be hit or miss here but overall I enjoy Destihl. I recommend this for groups or other gatherings since it is casual but still pretty nice. I like the pretzels for appetizer, the burgers for entree, and the banana cream pie for dessert (it is seriously awesome)."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time at Destihl!
We had our family Birthday party 8 people.
Started off with drinks and appetizers,
We had fried asparagus, bacon, and cheese curd all Yummy!
I had the Pot roast (delicious)
Our waiter was Dom he's the best!
We had Carrot cake for desert which we shared another DELICIOUS desert!
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great beers! I go here every chance I get. The menu changes seasonally and just about everything I've ordered has been wonderful! Service is always on par."}
{"text":"Overall, not impressed. My family decided to something a bit different this year and went to a new restaurant vs. going to old standbys. After finding a list of top restaurants online, we ended up settling on Destihl due to the large menu with seemingly lots of tasty options.

We made a reservation for a Monday night and we were seated right away. Parking can be a bit difficult mid-evening. We had to circle around the nearby city lot to finally find a spot. 

My order: Chorizo stuffed dates to share and Thai steak salad.

Other orders: Clam chowder (the soup of the day), House salad, Spicy Thai shrimp, and Pesto Chicken (recommended by the waiter).

The dates came out first. I didn't realize they were going to be wrapped in bacon. But score, I love it that way. The bacon needed to be cooked a bit more though. They had a nice kick to them. They were enjoyed for the most part, but these are much better in Atlanta.

As for main meal, the accidentally brought my mom a Caesar salad instead of the House salad. She was going to order it but changed her mind. The waiter forgot to write down the change. He came out quickly to apologize after it was delivered. The salad is a wedge salad with a crispy toast in place of croutons and a fried egg. My mom wasn't excited about the fried egg and gave it to us. I tasted it but didn't like it so passed it on to my brother. How do you mess up a fried egg?

My Thai steak salad was not very good. The steak was cooked more medium than medium well. There was not much of it. The greens were kinda soggy. The peanuts were way too salty. Much better in Atlanta, again.

Overall, portion sizes were adequate and we got our fill. We signed up for a rewards card that evening and were able to apply the purchase that we had just made to our rewards card. That was great. Even though I may not be back. There were plenty of other options that seemed great on the menu, but hesitant after this experience. Plus there are other places to try in the city.

Everyone else liked their food. So that's something. I was going to give them 3 stars given everyone else's satisfaction. But then I realized that I had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating my dad's birthday. They didn't do anything to signify that. Not even a happy birthday. Nothing! So 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place in the Champaign/ Urbana area. The food and beer is always wonderful. Last night I had the Thai Chicken. I will be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Great service by our waiter. He knew the menu in & out. Took me so long to choose what to order because they have too many good looking options on their menu! 

Finally decided to get the bacon, blue cheese pizza but switched out the blue cheese for Goat cheese! One of the best pizzas I've ever had! So much creamy goodness in this pizza."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple times, once for dinner and once for brunch - food is always great."}
{"text":"Second time here and have loved it both times!   Here with 2 different couples and each time everyone totally enjoyed the food and the service.  The rib eye is on the expensive side but very flavorable.  A great menu - generally decent pricing.  The carrot cake could easily serve 4 and is as good as you will ever have."}
{"text":"Yeah, Destihl has become a place that I am alright with eating at rather than a groan-worthy thing when other people suggest it.  It's still a smidge on the pricey side but it's a decent value and the food is usually pretty tasty.  The posole is pretty good and I think there's a pork tenderloin sandwich that is also decent.

I'd never choose it myself but I don't mind it.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Friday night at 5pm with a party of 12 and just had the best time! The staff was super friendly, I had to call twice to update my reservation and they were very accommodating. We were seated right away and our waiter (Brad?) was amazing!!! Super knowledgeable and extremely patient with all of us. 

The food has never been a miss for me.  I've come here several times and tried their jambalaya, a salad and this time a pasta and they've all been excellent.  We started with the beer-battered asparagus as an appetizer (it comes with 5 very large pieces and I split with someone else) and the flavor was melt in your mouth good. There's nothing too overpowering (sweetness or saltiness) about the batter/glaze and the asparagus flavor was very muted. This is marked as one of their signature dishes and with good reason :) For my entree, I decided to go a little bit healthier tonight and order the Squash and Cashew Cream pasta, which is both vegan and gluten free and WOW! It was incredibly incredibly delicious, I'm not sure what they put in that cashew sauce but it literally blew me away. Cannot rave enough about this, I'm so impressed considering that its Vegan/GF.

I was able to try bits of the carolina style bbq pork, the fish and chips as well as the stuffed poblano pepper and they were all fantastic.

The service was a tad bit slow, but we had a good-sized party and there were no mistakes in our separate checks (honestly, if an establishment is willing to do this for a large group, they deserve a 5/5), so I definitely appreciated it. 

This place is great for a date or to bring a group of friends who are looking for a classy vibe but you can still wear jeans and be comfortable.  4th great experience here and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Traveling on our way to Colorado, all the way from Maryland, we were famished and beleaguered. We wanted some good food.

We were in for a pleasant surprise. 

We started with pretzels as appetizers. They were the perfect balance between soft and hard, and were very filling. One could easily just come here for the pretzels alone. But then I got the pot roast. 

My mind was BLOWN.

To put it simply, it was like taking small forkfuls of heaven and putting it in my mouth. Tender meat and potatoes, and delicious gravy. Everything about it was perfect. As a bonus, I used the leftover pretzel to dip in the gravy, and it further amplified its flavor! 

Would go here all the time if we lived anywhere near here."}
{"text":"Beer is pretty good.   I'm not normally impressed with the offerings of small brewpubs, but this place is OK.   Liked every beer I was served.

Appetizers were good.   I enjoyed the bacon-wrapped dates.

Things fell apart a bit when it came to our main meal.   My hamburger was overcooked and uninteresting.   No condiments for my sandwich.   And waitstaff sorta evaporated once our food was delivered.

This is a restaurant I would visit to sit at the bar and enjoy beer and snacks.   But for lunch or dinner, I'd take my meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came here on a Friday night to have dinner. The food was great and so was the atmosphere. The problem i had was that it took 15 minutes to get water, and then another 20 for someone to take our order. Unfortunately it took an hour to get our food served to us. The food was brought out to us nice and hot, however the wait was not worth it. Destihl is a great local hang out and I usually don't have an issue with time there. I recommend either the Brew Master's Pizza, or the Beer Battered Bacon and egg burger."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good. I wish their beer menu had descriptions though. This seemed more like a food place with beer than a \"brewery\". It wasn't quite as relaxed as other breweries we've been to. 
The beer we had was pretty good. We're big fans of the wild sour series, so we were glad to be able to enjoy some on tap."}
{"text":"Destihl-ness is the move! 

They've only been open a few weeks but I'm predicting that this place is going to become an institution here in Champaign-Urbana. They're not quite there yet, BUT this four stars is partially based on potential. I don't know if that's acceptable for Yelp, but whatever.

I will admit I got a little gluttonous this evening. Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.

Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). 

For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).

For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. 

The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait. 

I'll be back no doubt and I'm pretty sure I'll be updating with 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge beer fan but that doesn't matter because the food is very good and so is the service (thanks Devyn for a wonderful meal)!  You can make a reservation using Yelp - so do that!  I appreciate that they have little 4oz pours of their beers so that I could have one (Samhain Pumpkin) and taste their artistry.  If you love beer, please go here!  We had the Tri Color Roasted Curry Carrots as our \"veg\" (it's an appetizer) and the spiciness and toasted flavor was a huge hit.  Other menu items like Bacon Mac 'n' Cheese and Pesto Pasta pair really well with the beer and are solid items.  The favority (no surprise) was the four-layer carrot cake - Oh My we were uhmming so much while sharing.  We intend to go again next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great food. Average service that was a little slow. The hour long wait for a table was well worth it,  but with better service they could turn over tables much quicker.

BUT.....the food is worth coming back for..... the beer batter deep fried bacon and egg burger was simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Our large group stopped for lunch on a visit to C-U.  The restaurant is located downtown and is easily accessible.

The menu was varied and our group decided to order multiple items to share for lunch.  All of the choices were prepared well.  My favorites were the cheese curds, soft pretzel and nachos.

Reasonable varied menu of beer.

Service was efficient and responsive.

All in all, a good spot for lunch.  A little pricey for C-U.  Access and parking were easy."}
{"text":"I had a red ale, I normally wouldn't give a place a bad review because I chose poorly.  In this case it's warranted because it's their own beer and they're responsible for the quality.  It was just a very thin beer, it didn't have enough flavor to stand up to the food.  I had their meatloaf dish, and I appreciate the idea of creating a blend of beef, bison, and lamb the loaf itself was over mixed and too dense.  The mashed potatoes seemed like they were made from a box, or they were over whipped, almost to a paste but there was enough butter to make them creamy.  The roasted vegetables were pretty good.  Ended with the bread pudding, which was a drier than I like, but the caramel sauce was good.  I liked how other things sounded on the menu if I go back I will update the rating but currently unimpressed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is large and has a little more of an elegant appearance. Perhaps it was the turkey sandwich that I ordered here, but I was not very impressed with the quality of food served for the price I paid. I have eaten a more satisfying meal for less. The staff however is very kind and accommodating which is why I gave it more stars."}
{"text":"Deep fried bacon is awesome. Great selection of beers. Service good. Waiter waaay too social. Buffalo was yummy. Nice ambiance. Ample parking. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I like it for lunch.   Their beer is alright.  The flatbread-y pizza with lemon and arugula was delicious.  I have it on good authority that their portobello sandwich is better than  The Bread Company. 

I think the dinner - both the crowds and the food - are a little pretentious.  My BF thinks that this is \"a great place for women who shop at Chicos to meet up with each other and discuss the braided leather belts they bought for their husbands.\"  Which is to say, he thinks they overdo atmosphere to keep the rif raff out.  In my experience, I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy.  Oh, midwestern restaurants.  Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos?  My littlest brother really liked it, though.  He devoured some friend bacon appetizer."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere... original menu items! First time here and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never had a meal (or drink) that was anything less than phenomenal here! The chicken and dumplings was especially good."}
{"text":"Forth time eating here and have had one meal that I enjoyed, the French toast. It seems the meal plan here is to keep adding ingredients until you feel you can charge $20 for the meal and serve. Maybe simplify a few dishes and let the quality of the food be enjoyed and not try to overwhelm the senses with every ingredient in the kitchen."}
{"text":"feel like eating American food today so i searched on yelp and found this restaurant. 
It taste SO BAD that i was planing to take out some food home so i ordered extra and in the end i didn't bring anything home.
I felt terrible when i was eating them. the wasabi is so strong that i can taste nothing else.
and no one is serving me anything. i don't really know who will get the tips since there is no one service me. my ice tea has already been empty and no one notice. 



SO BAD    
DO NOT COME"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! I think it was pretty authentic, although I have no way to confirm. The service was very friendly and it was a nice place to sit, talk, and eat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and great bar. Beer selection top shelf. Six for dinner could not have been nicer. Will definately return."}
{"text":"This is perhaps one of the best restaurants in Champaign-Urbana for any big event or celebrations. The restaurant has a huge banquet place to accommodate a large group of 12-15 people. Definitely reserve this place well in advance as it a very popular restaurant. I have mostly dined here in big groups. The interior of the restaurant is elegant, cozy and has a vibe of upscale. They have a huge selection of beer! Since I mainly drink wine, can't really comment on their handcrafted beer. They have some of the most delicious appetizers- cheese curds, the Bavarian style pretzels and shrimp ceviches are my favorite. Among the entree, their signature dish of warm potato and salmon is amazing. The salmon is medium cooked and with the honey, mustard dressing, it tastes delicious. It's definitely my top entree choice and a must try recommendation for others. The only thing I dislike the most about this restaurant is the wait time for food! They take unusually long time to serve the food. But if you are in a big group and busy with drinks, it's not too bad of an experience. Definitely the service can be improved."}
{"text":"Beer battered bacon. I could stop there, but there is even more. The beers are delicious and $5 per craft pint. There is an espresso-rubbed ribeye which I did not have but looked incredible. The dijon chicken was phenomenal.

The staff was great. I told them it was my coworkers birthday and they surprised her with s'mores! Good ones! Cast iron roasted marshmallows and an awesome chocolate sauce. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed here. From beer battered asparagus or jambalaya. Four cheese bacon mac or pulled pork. I've enjoyed five out of five of my meals here. Biggest piece of chocolate cake ever. Better bring help. Beer selection has always been interesting. I usually ask for tastes before committing. Service is good and helpful. Parking is my only complaint. But it's a short walk from city garage."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Destihl, I had to wait a few minutes. (The wait can get pretty long on weekends, though.) But the food was worth the wait! I ordered the curry cauliflower soup (featured soup) and the jambalaya. I also tried ordering the cheese curds for the appetizer, but they had ran out of them, so I ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was really tasty. I think the sauce and seasoning really hit the spot. The curry cauliflower soup was a bit oily but otherwise filling. And I loved the jambalaya, especially with the extra fried egg on top.

If you like beers, Destihl also has some pretty good beers. I've tried the Vienna lager and the strawberry blonde ale, and both were good. It's best to come here on a completely empty stomach and with a group - the portions are big and there's plenty of group seating throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in around 7 on Saturday night to find probably 12-15 waiting. We opted to circle the waters at the bar until a high top opened up which is first come first served. We found a table in about 20 minutes and although it could easily seat six we saddled up and took it. Later on a 4 top walked in and we swapped our table for two seats at the bar thay had recently cleared out so they could all sit together. Our waitress soon greeted us, handed us menus, and finished clearing our table. We ordered the nachos which has recommend by numerous people and our Entr√©e, I ordered the gaucho skirt steak (which was cooked perfectly and very good) and my wife ordered a sandwich which she commented wasn't as good as what she has normally experienced there. We were about 2/3 of the way through our nachos when my wife found a very long and kinky hair intertwined with the cheese. When our waitress came back we alerted her to the hair but unfortunately in the dimly lit bar it was hard to locate after I had placed it on the bar. Regardless they comp'd the nachos (as they should of) but no manager came to touch base with us but instead was talking to a drunk at the end of the bar. We kind of got the feeling that the staff thought we were making it up (which we were not). All in all the service was great, my food was good, just disappointed on my wife's sandwich and the managers lack of response. We'll be back eventually but maybe ask for a table with better lighting."}
{"text":"Many gluten free options!! Food was great and I felt just fine after eating there! The waiter made me feel confident that he knew about gluten."}
{"text":"Excellent service, ambiance and the meal. We had the potato appetizer and fought over the last one. I had the chicken and dumplings while my husband enjoyed the bacon burger with homemade fries. My drink was \"Caught in the Rain\" incredible !  I was on vacation after every sip. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This restaurant an amazing place to stop while traveling especially for gluten free food. The town is cute and the food was great. The cedar plank salmon was a one sitting proportion. It tasted great. The gluten free options were limited but were different from what is typical when eating out.  The squash and cashew meal was delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"There hamburger is a 5 star real fancy made up ...fries season to the t...they make their own beer wich i dont drink got great tea but its high as hell to eat there but worth it"}
{"text":"Utterly fantastic food.  The chef is a genious on par with any of the best restaurants in town, but at a lower price than some of the more expensive competition.  Not as nice of an atmosphere as some of the fine-dining restaruants like Jim Gould's and Silvercreek, but every bit as tasty.  Destihl is going to have a great impact on downtown.

Also, while I'm not a beer person, the people I ate with said the beer is an excellent local micro-brew.  Perhaps not amazing, but just as much as any reasonable person could hope for.

Also, they do have a meeting/conference room with a large table and an LCD TV."}
{"text":"I have been there twice till now and I am amazed at how classy a brewery's restaurant can be in a college town! They have few of the best appetizers I have had and certainly the best in the urbana-champaign area. They profess their best appetizer are the cheese curds (which are good) but the best of the lot has to be the Potato croquettes. I have had the beer-battered asparagus as well which changed my taste buds liking towards asparagus! 

I am a vegetarian and its extremely difficult to find a good vegetarian burger, so i was skeptical to order that (most places have burnt, bitter black bean patty!!) but they had one of the biggest veggie burger I have seen. The patty had rice, carrots, ginger and a few other veggies blended with the beans making it really delicious filling. The only vegetarian entree they have is the Stuffed Poblano Peppers, which was excellent. 

The staff is extremely courteous (sometimes more so than needed) and are very keen to entertain you. 

A few negatives are, the beer selection is great but is limited. I expect a brewery to have all their beers available (except the seasonal's, obviously) but they seem to rotate their beer. Even though the beer tastes good, I would cut some points for the spread of it. Another thing would be the place is unable to substitute any of the meat based dish with a vegetarian option which is a turn off if you are a vegetarian. 

P.S. Make a reservation, it is usually crowded!"}
{"text":"Tried it again after awhile and boy have the portions gotten smaller and still as expensive. I will totally pay for it if it's worth it but I don't think it is. I think it only gets good ratings bc there isn't much to choose from here in c/u along these lines. Also the atmosphere is nice and beer is pretty good for being able to order the small ones to try more. But yeah, won't be back."}
{"text":"A brewery with excellent cuisine is not easy to find. But Destihl (pronounced \"distill\", like distillery) rivals some of the staples found in Chicago. I would categorize this food as Southern Comfort. 

Ambiance: Casual. The dining room is nice and spread out with a good combination of booths and tables. The set up didn't feel crowded and you don't have to feel like you're navigating through a labyrinth to get to the restroom. The brewery is right on site and is surrounded by glass which can be seen as soon as you enter inside the doors. Nearby is the bar with plenty of high boys and televisions. Great place if you are waiting to be seated. 

Food: Amazing! The waitress gave us some good recommendations. We ordered the fried green tomatoes with like a crab souffl√©-type sauce on top. So delicious. The broccolini salad was super hearty with yummy veggies -- it was quite tasty with toasted walnuts and greens. Finally we got the jambalaya and the portions were so large I spilt it with the hub -- that it felt like I had a full portion. Finally, the best thing I ever tasted and I am craving is the banana cream pie! So good. Caramelized almost creme br√ªl√©e-like bananas slices top a pretty large pie (3 adults split it) with light whipping cream and banana custard in a tart cup and not a pie crust. With mint tea it hit the spot. 

Service and Staff: our waitress was kind, sweet and helpful. She gave us several recommendations including the biggest burger our friend ate. By the way it had a beer battered bacon topping. Which was too fattening for words and bordered on being carnie food (I don't like carnival foods). We were the last party to leave and overstayed past closing. Despite our late departure, the waitress never asked nor urged us to leave and even allowed us to order dessert. 

Overall: I'd go back to Champaign just to check out this restaurant (among others). It's in a great location, the food is fun and delicious. The service is friendly - coupled with local craft beers you can't beat it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food but great beer. There are two locations one in Champaign and the other in Bloomington.  They both have unique food and drinks. I've never had anything I didn't like here."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderfully delicious meal here tonight! We have a 5 month old, so going out to dinner isn't a frequent occasion. Desthil did not disappoint!! Kelsey was our server and she was brilliant! She mentioned it was her second day, out of training, and we would have never known. She made great beer and food recommendations and her overall service and personality was appreciated."}
{"text":"Sat outside on a gorgeous 82 degree night. Drinks were superb coupled with the beer battered fried bacon. The sauce is amazing!! Had the Nitro (double pale ale) and a Jacob's ladder (brown ale). 

For entree we had the flat iron steak and rice/beans and fish and chips. Again-- superb!  Whitney waited on us and made sure ALL was sheer perfection. She recommended the perfect tequila/amaretto mixed drink for me since my husband is the beer drinker. 

Wonderful date night!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness you guys! I wish I lived in Champaign so I could visit more often! This food is filling, savory and delicious! My sister and I ordered the pretzels as appetizers. It came with two mouth-watering sauces. Then I ordered the berry goat cheese (I opted w/o cheese) salad and my sister ordered a sweet potato salad. Both so darn good! And I have to mention that our server was wonderful! He gave us recommendations on what to try and what were fan-favorites. So helpful and knowledgable! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"OK, if it wasn't for the weird service we experienced, this would totally be 5 stars. At first, our server spent a lot of us time with us going over all the different beers and was super knowledgeable and basically just a really good server. Halfway into dinner he disappeared and other people started bringing us our food. When we asked where he was, we were told that he was in the  back doing other things. At the end of dinner he returned to being our server but also bartender so we were basically ignored. Very weird service.

We tried 11 of the 14 beers they make. I personally like really hoppy beers, but alas I can't remember the names of the ones I liked. For appetizers we ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, which were AMAZING! We also ordered lamb meatballs. I love anything with goat cheese so both of these appetizers were right up my alley. In the past, I have also gotten beer battered asparagus which is also super delicious.

Originally, I ordered the pesto and goat cheese pizza but unfortunately it was very soggy and my plate was drenched in grease. Even the server commented that it was excessively soggy. I sent it back, which is something I NEVER do. I then ordered the flat iron quesadillas from the appetizers as my dinner. It didn't disappoint. 

My favorite part was definitely the chorizo stuffed dates."}
{"text":"Been a while since we went here but I said I would post a review and I am finally doing it. We were crossing through there and back from a trip to Indy and is was a good enough experience to return on the way back. The brewer took me on a tour of the facilities and we bantered about state laws and differences between Texas and Indiana. The menu provided option for my entire picky, gluten free eating family. I very much enjoyed the beers. They had a huge selection and not all were perfect, however using beeradvocate and the waiters I was able to parse through the weaker options and pretty much only had great beers. I highly recommend this joint for a nice family restaurant that also has great craft beer."}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a dinner across the street. We were originally going to eat here, but were told the food was bland. 

Aside from that, we had some beers. I like the hefeweizen and the porter. A good place to hang out. Will try the menu another time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I left underwhelmed by my experience.


I went here in a group of six on a Friday night.  My neighbors, another couple, and my date The restaurant was surprisingly dead in my opinion, but after our service and food...I can see why. The word/phrase/reaction Yelp uses with their rating system is perfect: A-OK.

We sat down and ordered drinks. Water and beer for the whole table. We all were deciding what to get. My date went with the Ancho Chicken Salad (she loves avocado too...score!), and among the other items ordered were the Kobe (Bryant) Burger (I bet it regrets that night in Colorado...hahah), Stuffed Poblano Peppers, Weissenheimer chicken, Flat Iron Steak, and last but certainly not least...I went with the Cedar Plank Salmon. It was excellent! I was pleasantly surprised. I also added the Greekish Salad to my meal which was delicious and amazingly 5.75. I guess olives are like gas...price just keeps going up. I asked for the dressing on the side for both my salmon and salad, and our waiter went 1-2 on that one. I guess in baseball that's good...for this Yelper....not so good.

This place is a Gastropub...whatever the hell that means. The food comes with a lot of flair and the taste is there, but if someone were to ask me, \"How was Destihl?\", I'd tell them \"eh\". 

The second time I came here I was paid for (hell ya starving teacher) and I ordered the Greekish salad (again) and Red Chili Braised Pork. The salad was great, but I asked for the dressing on the side and got in on the salad. The pork was awesome. I was no doubt influenced by my brothers' recent pork tenderloin dinner ideas.

I have a ton of C-U places I can't wait to try. I am glad I tried this place again just to make sure the first time wasn't an anomaly. It wasn't. I would not recommend going here because there are much better options LITERALLY a stone's throw away. You could throw a stone to Guido's, KoFusion, and BGT if you crow hop!"}
{"text":"I've been to Destihl a few times and always leave unsatisfied. As a disclaimer I have only gone as a member of a big group. Also, they have always been very good about steering me away from unsafe gluten-y dishes and I've never gotten sick.

However, the actual food is lacking. I had dijon chicken the last time I was there and it was burnt and over cooked but the sides were underdone. My boyfriend got a steak which came out a bit too rare and was just a bad cut- riddled with lines of fat. On a previous visit I had fish dish that was so over-seasoned with peppercorn I could hardly eat it. 

I know several people who swear by their food but it seems to be inconsistent at best."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Champaign and came here for lunch.  Contemporary, open restaurant with a good vibe in downtown Champaign.  Our waiter was Trent; very personable, knowledgeable and helpful.  There is no set beer flight but you can order 4 oz small glasses if you want to sample.  I really enjoyed the Oktoberfest and the Roadblock British Red Ale.  We shared the Beer Batter Asparagus for an appetizer and really enjoyed it (Trent encouraged us to squeeze the grilled lemon over the Asparagus and glad that we did).  We ordered the Lunch Combos.  The soup and sandwiches were top notch.   I know there are a lot of restaurants in the C/U area, but you can't go wrong here.  If the rest of the wait staff are as good as Trent, you will be taken care of quite nicely.   Very good beer, very good food in an inviting atmosphere, I definitely recommend Destihl."}
{"text":"I came here because their dessert menu had about 3 options with pecans and I love pecans. Their in house brewery interested me too.

I haven't been to a restaurant where they offered 4oz sample sizes of beers. I got the \"Matt and the Giant Juicy Juicy Mango IPA.\" I'm not the biggest fan of beer, but this wasn't that bad to me and also it was nice to have just a sample size so I don't waste any beer.


My friend and I started out with the appetizer, chorizo stuffed dates. I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. 

I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry. I thought the green beans weren't cooked as long, but the mashed potatoes were really good.

My friend got the Brewmaster's pizza. I liked that it was a personal pizza and they also offer gluten free bread. It's nice that this restaurant is conscious about that.

The service was awesome too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.

I felt like some foods had a spicy twist on them which I think is a nice flavor to pair with IPAs.

I didn't get to try any desserts because the kitchen closed. I know so sad because I went there wanting the dessert the most, but at least my appetizer and entree was good."}
{"text":"Stopped on a Monday for a late lunch. Server was great and food was wonderful. The fried asparagus app was so good we ordered a second plate. We had a party of six (two kids- there is a kids' menu)... plenty of room to accommodate us. I would like to come back and try some of the brews... it is a brew pub after all."}
{"text":"I really do think the food here is great, even compared to food in Chicago. The prices are really fair, and for someone who's not a beer expert the beer selection is fine. The wine is pretty good too at a decent price.

I would definitely recommend the seasonal specials. They are always so fresh tasting and so delicious. 

The interior is very modern and has a high class feel. The bathrooms are clean. There's a parking lot nearby as well as street parking. 

Definitely a place you should visit is you're in Champaign."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I have been here twice now and enjoyed everything I've had. 

Visit #1: Tried a few beers before selecting one. The drafts come in three sizes, which is really nice. My friends and I got the pretzels with cheese and mustard dipping sauces, and LOVED them. I got the bison burger with fries and had to stop myself from eating the whole thing before my stomach exploded! Great wait staff and a very classy atmosphere.

Visit #2: Another great beer experience. Got a pizza this time, which was pleasantly adequate for a one person dinner. It was thin and crispy, but not crunchy...just the way I like it! We sat at a window near the bar and watched downtown during sunset, which was really nice. I like the corner location...lots of natural light!

Will definitely consider coming here whenever I want to eat downtown. Reasonably priced for the quality, and a great overall dining experience."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Sunday brunch is the best. The bacon wrapped figs are to die for. The staff is outstanding. The beer is fantastic. Great place in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"I've come here on a number of occasions, usually work-related. The food is tasty and the appetizers are creative. As long as you're seated away from the bar, it's usually quiet enough to carry on civilized conversation. However, The beer is pretty disappointing, particularly for a brewery. As a result, this place is not my first choice for a night out, but makes for a good dinner in general."}
{"text":"Destihl can do no wrong! Everything I've ever ordered here has been beyond excellent. I'll list some of my favorites, but I truly think that you'll be satisfied if you order anything at Destihl. Oh, and definitely keep in mind that most dishes here have large portions!

Favorites include:
- Chorizo stuffed dates
- Cheese curds 
- Skillet nachos 
- Thai chicken pasta 
- Any of the burgers because all of them perfect
- Sausage and fennel pizza 
- Trout with sausage hash
- Chicken pot pie
- Fish tacos"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place!  My fiance and I made last minute reservations here on Christmas Eve...we had a GREAT waitress, can't remember her name...who understood we wanted to move quick so we could catch Mission Impossible (which would only get about 2 stars, by the way).

We ordered the flat bread (I'm obsessed with truffle oil), one of their specialty pizzas and a Greek salad to share.  We were impressed with ALL of it.  Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.

We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.

Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest.  We will definitely return and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Placed was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night. Makes sense though, the food is awesome and reasonably priced. We all really liked our dishes."}
{"text":"Outstanding first visit. Our food was very good (beer battered deed fried bacon on a burger -are you kidding?!?!-awsome!) cheese curds and sandwiches were very good also. Sampled several of their beers including special releases-very tasty as well. Wait staff was attentive. Overall a great visit!"}
{"text":"The beer is what matters most and to that affect I was feeling bold when I stopped in, so I tried the Sour Nectarine.  We'd been in the sun all day and a fruit based beer had appeal.  The first sip of this beer comes off like a lemon exploding in your mouth.  Tart as sh*t and hardly appealing.  Or is it?  I kept going back for sip after sip until it was gone, so I can't deny that it was decent.

For dinner I ordered the spinach salad.  The portion size was more adequate for lunch but it was also one of the best spinach salads I've ever had.  With applewood-smoked bacon, white cheddar bleu cheese, diced tomatoes, sliced egg, red onion, maple & jalape√±o bacon dressing...it's just damn good.  

The restaurant itself has a corporate feel to it.  Very rigid seating and decor. They do have outdoor seating but it was full up when we arrived, so we were forced indoors.  

I liked my dinner and beer here but on the whole I'd say Destihl was average for a brewery restaurant.  
Cheers."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. 
I'm in champaign visiting my sister, and a friend of ours recommended we go to Destihl. He touted it as a gift from the gods. Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??
So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)
A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:
Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. 
Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. 
Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting. 
 For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. 
My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like \"we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead.\" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. 
All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be \"cool.\" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here a handful of times during my 5 years in Chambana and had a great experience almost every time. They have some fantastic dishes - the swordfish is AWESOME, the beer battered asparagus is enormous, the burgers are great and the desserts are intense. The drinks are good too. I brought many different people here and they all had a great time too. I think the one dish that was unanimously disliked was the bleu cheese quesadilla thing. TOO MUCH BLEU CHEESE. It's a great location for groups and the service always seemed to be timely and personable. Would definitely go again if I traveled down that way more often."}
{"text":"It's OK sometimes and not so good other times. their original restaurant in Bloomington is consistently good and much better; food and beer. Not sure why they have not been able to duplicate their quality in Champaign but I wish they would."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Good beers for sure and real potential for food...Chipotle Chicken sandwich was good but the 'sprouts' made it hard and messy to eat. Otherwise good combo of flavors (bun engulfed the chicken breast and should have been smaller).  Cole slaw was right on for me as it was low on sauce and was a good mix of veggies."}
{"text":"5 stars just for the Iced Tea!!! It wasn't your average passion fruit, it was something better; even garnished with an orange. The service was on the brink of \"too good\" and the food was excellent.

We sat at the bar to watch the Illinois Basketball game; they have about 3-4 TVs to watch sports. There is also plenty of seating.

For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. 

For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again. It truly felt like a hearty, but healthy lunch option, especially relative to other options on the menu. The price cannot be beat."}
{"text":"I wish this place would close. The beer is bad, the food is meh, and the service is awful EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN and I've been three times."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Champaign right on the busiest corner of that area, the restaurant flanks two corners & has great views. I loved the restaurant decor and the set up. We sat in the bar near the windows - super open & light.

Our waiter, Chris, took great care of us. I love it when the staff has their favorites but can also describe each of the dishes when asked. Oh, and what a sweetie, he went and found a phone charger for me and plugged it in near our table. Anyone who joins me in my travel blogging experiences knows that I am constantly draining my phone battery with snapchat, instagram, photos, etc. So, this endeared me to him right away!  Overall great service and the food was served quickly.

What we ate:

Beer. Battered. Bacon- BOOM, throw down the mic. This appetizer is pretty larger - about 4-5 slices of jalape√±o bacon with a yummy sweet dipping sauce

Spinach Salad - Chris humored me and brought several of the different salad dressings - these are definitely house made. I added in salmon. Super great crisp on the salmon that was flavorful and salty and the salmon was also moist on the inside without being too undercooked or mushy.  Well played, cooks in the kitchen.

Bacon Cheeseburger - my fledgling travel blogger BFF, Vonda MacFarlane, ordered the burger and was overjoyed.  Super moist (ok, like dripping messy moist which is glorious in this case).  Again, our waiter was great because he brought extra pickles and mayo on request (yes, we are midwestern girls, we like our mayo which I know can be a polarizing condiment) .  We requested extra crispy fries and they were fabulous.

Oh, let's talk about the bathroom. Yes, I did an odd sesueway but it's only because I tend to write sequentially as the experience unfolds. Vonda visited the ladies room during our meal and came back insisting that we stop by before we leave (even if I didn't have to go, we needed to go) 

First off, I love the brick wall dividers in the hallway not the way to restrooms - great design and it divides the sections of the restaurant nicely. 

So, back to the restroom.  It's like a little spa because there is a sitting area, and sink areas and then each WC is its only little room. Yes, at times I can be easily amused but this little spot was super cute for such a busy restaurant. Oh and it has the fun Dyson hand dryers as well as paper towels (this really entertained Vonda too) 

If i lived in Champaign, this would be one of my favorites. #FoSho"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The desserts are to die for and the staff is very attentive. Some may think the place looks pricey from the outside but it's very affordable!!  The food is great."}
{"text":"3.5 for food
4.5 for drinks

Destihl seems to have all the right ingredients to become THE hot spot downtown, but I didn't leave it feeling like I really want to come back. 

Service was very slow, but since it's the first weekend of operation, I'm not going to take any points off. The decor was really nice, cosy, and even a little cosmopolitan. I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good, but nothing to get excited about. I tried the fried cheese appertiser, and while good, they also weren't anything to write home about. Overall, food was good, but not great. There are better restaurants elsewhere.

The drinks, on the other hand, were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect. They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part. 

Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown. Great ambient, great location, great drinks, and good food. Even though it's not anywhere near there yet, I'm sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I've been a bad yelper and late on this review, but let me just say I can still taste the delicious beer I drank in this place over a month ago. I was in town for a recruiting visit and found this place on yelp. My food was great (try the lamb meatballs) and my beer was even better. Lots of great winter brews and an excellent spirits list as well. If you are in town like me for work, avoid the mediocre campus options. Come here, drink, be merry. Oh and sit at the bar... this little baby has a wait and reservation list."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Highly recommended!! Brunch and dinner are both great, go check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Update:  Stopped by again.

Still disappointing.  Their brussel sprouts are baked but watery.  Ick.

I did try their scallops.. that was better on top of quinoa.  Not the best.. but certainly nothing to write home about.

And the funniest thing I observed.. I don't recall seeing any beer on their menu even though they have their own beer distillery.  What?!!

********************************************************************
Maybe it's my big city experiences that make me not excited about this place.

I had such high expectations and went here for dinner.. I'm never around anymore BUT I am here shortly for work.

Tried their skirt steak which is a special... it was with a demi glace and green beans.  Really not that great.. it's okay.  

I tried three of their red wines:  syrah, pinot noir, and tempranillio.  All were not that good.  Pricey though for Champaign.. compared to Black Dog the previous evening... meh."}
{"text":"Destihl is my go to restaurant when I want outstanding food and service. Everything here is great, especially the desserts and beer but, the cheese curds get the most of my ettention. Try all the things here, it's never anything but fantastic."}
{"text":"Loved the Beer Battered Deep Friend Bacon... yes BACON! Staff was wonderful and helpful even when I had a small problem with my sandwich. I hadn't read that the fried egg on the BLT was made sunny side up so when I got it I ran everywhere. I don't like sunny side up eggs so they took it back without question and got me a different burger. Which was wonderful! Would have loved to had some dessert but I was too full when I got done. Great place!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to venue in downtown Champaign for business luncheons or a relaxed beer after work. The interior is elegant in an understated, modern way and feels very warm and cozy. I am always happy with the brew selections here (and I should since it is a brewery, right?) but the food is also quite good. My favorites are the wide selection of salads and burgers. Appetizers are good when you're here for drinks-nachos are recommended. Service is prompt which is important when you're on a schedule during work hours. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Destihl for both dinner and brunch. Loved both. I'm far from a beer expert, but I loved the brews I tried there, including the Lord Normington, Oktoberfest and the Hefeweisen. Nice wine list, too.  On to the food  Okay, I'm echoing the sentiments of previous Yelpers, but yes, oh yes, oh yes, get the cheese curds and the beer-battered bacon. Fried fat-gasms galore. I loved the warm-potato grilled salmon I had for dinner, as well as the french toast I devoured at brunch. Service was fantastic.  Ate dinner at the bar, with Curtis as our server, and had brunch with Dana helping us.  Both great people, and their suggestions were completely on-target.  Prices are amazingly reasonable.  I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like this place but I kinda don't at he same time. It's nice, the staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable, I've never had to wait long but I also feel like they make simple things a little too complicated in terms of the food. So far I've enjoyed my meals. I will say their jambalaya is okay but it's definitely not authentic. Not even close. But pretty good still. Pretty nice place."}
{"text":"Destihl has a huge menu (good for picky eaters or a crowd with mixed tastes) and does many things well.  The pizza with figs is super yummy and the carrot cake is one of the best deserts in C-U.  Moist, rich, and not overly sweet.  Don't go for the dry chocolate cake--rookie mistake--get the carrot.  It is also a great place to bring families and smaller children.  The service is generally good and they are fairly quick."}
{"text":"Great experience, with great food. The service was quick, polite, and professional. I highly recommend the swordfish (unless it's seasonal and/or replaced by the time of this reading)."}
{"text":"I can start off by saying that this is definitely my favorite restaurant in the Champaign area. When I first came in here I was skeptical because being a broke college kid this would seem to run a bigger hole in my wallet but it really didn't. My first time being here I just ordered the fish tacos which had an explosion of flavor. I had never had fish tacos before this time but let me just say it is one of my new favorite dishes especially from here, the blend of the chimichurri swordfish, avocado mousse, and chipotle coleslaw created such an elegant flavor it was to die for. And then the second time I came I tried the beer-battered fish and chips which was also probably the best fish and chips I have ever gotten from a restaurant. The use a cod fish which I am not the biggest fan of because of how usually dry it is but their fish was so moist and delicious that I had no problem finishing my whole plate. Overall, I would recommend Destihil to anyone looking for a good eat in the downtown Champaign area. The staff, food and beer where all excellent so they will be seeing me once again in the near future."}
{"text":"I visited recently with a large private party:

Pros:
+Dedicated serving staff for our private group. The server and his \"trainee\" were excellent!
+Beer-Battered Asparagus. You won't regret it.
+Excellent vibe. It's a nice mix of trendy-casual-upscale.

This isn't really a con, more like a warning: the food was great but some of it was pretty pricey! It's easy to overlook this since I wasn't paying. But many of the comments from those I was with indicated that this is a special occasion place due to the wait and the price."}
{"text":"This place is so mismanaged it's unbelievable. My party was told it was a 25 minute wait, when it reality we waited for an hour and twenty minutes to ever be seated. During this waiting the host lied and told us twice that are table was being cleaned off and it would just be a minute. Super tacky and unprofessional. I highly do not recommend. You're better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite thing to get from Destihl is the Huevos Rancheros during brunch. My fiance and I have been to this restaurant many times as it is one of our favorite restaurants in town. I have had many things off of their menu including the pot roast, jambalaya, skirt steak, cedar plank salmon, etc. It's all been really tasty. 

The fiance is a pescatarian and they have many options for him as well. We also order either the bavarian pretzels or the cheese curds for an appetizer. Yum!

The one annoyance with this restaurant. You can have an appointment for 6:00pm, show up at 5:30pm (with half of the restaurant being empty) and for some unknown reason they won't seat you. We have had it happen more than once where we are able to get out of work earlier than expected and are made to wait even though a vast majority of the restaurant is open. The absolute worst was a day when more than half of the restaurant was empty. We were told we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. A large table (8) walked in WITHOUT a reservation asking to be seated and they were taken directly to a table. 

If the food weren't so good, the service from the front desk would definitely turn us away. With as bad as the front desk is, the servers have always been on the top of their game with us. I did remove one star for the front desk staff."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times that it's rare to find an item on the menu I haven't had.  Honestly, there's nothing on the menu that, if they told me they were out of everything else, I wouldn't turn down that item.  And the beers?  Wow - great variety and their in-house brewed beers are fantastic.  Seriously, I have no complaints.  One of my favorites in CU."}
{"text":"The Ruben egg rolls are so unique and delicious. Our dinner was also very good..we ate the Thai chicken and a half roasted chicken (not sure what it was called). Both of these entrees were massive and very tasty. I knocked it down a star because the service was average. But above all, the mango ipa was the best!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. I've had the pot roast sandwich and the bison burger. The pot roast was a surprisingly small portion. The bun on my bison burger was a little stale. Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky."}
{"text":"After three dining experiences at Destihl, the biggest complain I have is that they consistently over salt their food. Hey, what's up with that? Lighten up on the soy sauce please! Some of us would like to actually taste our food without leaving with high blood pressure. The Thai chicken wings were salty. The meatloaf was salty and dry. The Thai fried chicken is a good concept, but again it was salty. My chicken was under cooked. The waitress was apologetic and promptly got it re-fried (nice service). Although I didn't get to try them, the burgers and pizzas looked pretty good (but if you're just looking for burgers and pizzas there are much better places). The chocolate cr√®me brulee was a travesty! No resemblance to cr√®me brulee in terms of taste or texture. Extremely unpleasant! 

However, there is something on the menu that is truly mind blowing! BEER-BATTERED BACON! WOW! So crispy and thick! Must have! 

Bottom line, if you're here for drinks, order the beer-battered bacon and maybe burgers and pizza. Everything else on the menu is mediocre at best. Oh, and don't forget your blood pressure medication. You'll need it!"}
{"text":"Destihl was something that was completely unexpected for me to find in downtown Champaign. It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated, and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy. We were there about 3pm on a Monday. I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. 

The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles.  After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers.  I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine.  All were really awesome.

I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.

Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well."}
{"text":"First time to dine. Service was excellent. We had a reservation we were about 15 min late.  The host was very gracious and sat us immediately. As an appetizer we had the chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in jalape√±o bacon with a sweet, tangy glaze. They were delicious.  My date had the fish tacos served with a black bean rice.  His only complaint was there could've been more fish in the taco.  I had the jambalaya.  A perfect combination of spice with a generous mix of sausage and shrimp.  The corn muffin was moist and flavorful.

Recommend reservation for a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended to me by a friend and did not disappoint! We started with the Reuben eggrolls and they were AMAZING. I'd like to go back and just get those, if I could! The steak I ordered was perfectly cooked, asparagus and potatoes were really well-seasoned. The stuffed poblano peppers were also a hit. What's nice about this restaurant is that the prices are definitely fair for the amount of food you get. Their homebrewed beer selection is great and I'd definitely recommend the Bela Imperial Pilsner. Customer service was superb and the restrooms were VERY clean! I'm looking forward to visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Awesome selection in beers and spirits. I love their selections and different diversities in the types of food they have. Overall always have an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, maybe I'll give it another try next time. But the people there are so nice and gave us good recommendations, I like how the servers are so aware on what they have."}
{"text":"As a poor college student, this is my splurge go-to restaurant when I want to treat myself or someone else. It's not so expensive to the point where I feel bad about it, and every single time that I've been there (at least 4 by now), has been fantastic. Every new dish or drink that I try is not only tasty, but also different enough from others, which makes for an exciting experience every time. This is a great place to take your parents out to, and I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"It was our last few days on campus and one of my roommates wanted to grab a nicer dinner before we left for the summer.

Craft beer and unique burgers are probably our go-to cuisine when dining out. I suggested we try Destihl after having a pretty good experience there with my family last time. 

This visit was equally as good!

We opted to sit at the bar and watch the Bulls game due to the dining room wait being around 35 minutes which was much too long for two very hungry college kids.

We started with a few 4oz beer samples which are very convenient and not too expensive, I dislike having to commit to a roughly $5 16oz beer not knowing much beforehand. I particularly enjoyed the oatmeal nitro but didn't much care for the Champaign blonde.

The beer-battered bacon was a must-try for us since I didn't get it last time and it gets a lot of attention here on Yelp. We also opted for the cheese curds, both of these appetizers were so artery-cloggingly delicious.

The Bulls started to seriously disappoint us and when our food arrived we were glad to have something else to focus on, rather than the demise of Chicago basketball this season. 

I ordered the meatloaf and my roommate got the rancher burger. He said his was really tasty, right up there with the burger we had at Farren's a few weaks earlier. I went with the meatloaf to try something different and when it came out I was initially a little taken aback, but after trying it that all changed. This was not your grandmother's meatloaf! It was rolled up and wrapped in prosciutto sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes adorned with some thinly sliced vegetables all inside a cast iron skillet. The meatloaf itself was well seasoned and actually had a little spice to it. What really made this dish though was the prosciutto, it added that nice smoky pork flavor to the meatloaf. I highly recommend this dish!

The service was a little different because we were at the bar. The bar staff was extremely busy due to having a packed dining room and fairly full bar as well. There were about two people taking care of us and they made sure we always had beer and were quick to clear our plates as well as check in frequently. Service: great!

Overall, another great experience at Destihl. Though, like I mentioned last time, it comes a bit of a steeper price than some other potential options nearby. Either way, we really liked our food."}
{"text":"I'd been putting off going here due to what I'd heard about the prices, finally went for a get-together with friends and was impressed. Service was pretty great. We had a big group, 16 people, and it didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would for our food to get to us. I also have a baby and a stroller and the host was great about getting her a high chair before we even asked, and was very chill about finding a place for the stroller and just having the baby around in general. 

The food was delicious. I had a Thai steak salad, and the steak came on its own next to the salad so you can cut it yourself and get the full delicious steak experience and not lose any juiciness. The steak was tender and cooked wonderfully, and the salad was nicely spicy, with some spicy peanuts that I think they make in-house. Good deal for $12, in my opinion, or at least not overpriced compared to restaurants with similar food. My husband had the fish and chips, which I thought were pretty nice too. Potato wedges were a bit salty, but I love salt, so I was happy. Beer-wise, I had a house IPA that was good but not great. Would go again for a nice meal out. It seems like a good place to go on a date or celebrate an event, and they seem to handle large groups well."}
{"text":"Man, Champaign (my hometown) now has two brewpubs within a block of each other. Houston (where I live now) has none. Why can't the 4th largest city in the US have a brewpub? I digress.

There is a sterile and industrial atmosphere here. One that I am seeing in more in more bars, and I am not a fan. The style does not work here looks like the pub and owners are being cheep.  Seems cold to me. The bar is to the left with some tables and booths. To the right on the Neil St side is another dinning area. The brewing equipment can be seen from the Church St side. A few TV's above the bar, but unintrusive. Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.

The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.

There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles.  Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.

Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town."}
{"text":"The beers I've had seem to always fall short. The food has too much going on for a brewery. They either need to commit to being a brewery or being a restaurant."}
{"text":"Stuffed Poblano Peppers! They are just delicious. The food at this place is amazing. It is also very wholesome. The staff is super helpful and makes really good selections.

The location is fantastic and right in the middle of downtown and very accessible by bus. They have free validated parking available as well.

They have a craft brewery as well and have some of the finest selections of beers. Make sure to try their 4oz selections.

Lastly, the outdoor patio. Definitely the place to be for lunch during spring and summers."}
{"text":"Couldn't be better for lunch. Service was on point and friendly (word on the street is they hijacked 80% of Houlihan's staff). Their beers were solid, too. I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.

The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).

Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.

This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great  modern ambiance. I will never pass up an invite to eat here."}
{"text":"I enjoy Destihl as a break from campus food.  Yes, it's slightly more expensive but you get what you pay for.  The burgers are gourmet and the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a few colleagues. There was spacious seating, so it was a  great place for groups. Had the Dijon chicken with asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. I was kind of put off by the dark color of the sauce, but the whole entree was pretty good; chicken was flavorful and tender too. For dessert I had the baked apples, which was good but nothing unique. Our waitress was very attentive, but  her attentiveness seemed to taper off as the night went on."}
{"text":"This was the fourth time I've been to destihl since it opened in champaign.  The first two times were within the first 6 months it opened and I left less than impressed.  I finally came back a year or so later and the food has definitely gotten better.

This time I went for lunch and had the swordfish tacos with rice and beans on the side.   This was pretty good.  Maybe just a bit heavy on the sauce which masked a lot of the fish but the chimichurri sauce itself was good.  My wife had the chimichurri shrimp pizza and hers was excellent!  I also have to mention the last time I was here I had the beer-brined double bone in pork chop and that was easily the best dish I had here.

After a few early lackluster visits this place is slowly becoming one of the better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"A great variety of beers. very happy to have it in champaign. 

Food is good too but I always go here for the beer. I wish they improved their appetizers section a bit. Not many appetizers designed for sharing. 

awesome ambiance. Service depends on how busy they are the wait staff you get. I have been here many times and the experience varied."}
{"text":"Abysmal service. I have never experienced such awful and unprofessional customer service in my life as I did last night, which has driven me to write my first-ever Yelp review.

The food was decent, and our waitress was great. But, the 40 minutes leading up to it were a frustrating ordeal. The one-star of my review is based on the pre-meal wait.

I came in with a party of 16 and had made a reservation one week in advance. I chose Destihl because it is one of the few restaurants in Champaign that can accommodate a large party, especially on a Friday night. I received several reminders via phone call and text message about my reservation for 7:15PM. My party arrived on the dot, and was told by the hostess that two customers had already paid the bill a while ago but were still sitting at our table, but anticipated an additional 15-minute wait. 

After over 20 minutes, I checked with the hostesses who halfheartedly said the table was still occupied, and that there was nothing that could be done. (At this point, the previous customers had been occupying the space with the paid bill for over 30 min now). The hostesses made no effort to check on those customers and simply stood at the counter, chatting. I would have left already, but knew there would be no other restaurant available on such short notice. Finally, at 7:55, I decided to express my dissatisfaction, and was once again rudely dismissed. After I pushed back, she halfheartedly offered to get the manager. 

I repeated my complaints to the manager, who was also shockingly indifferent and gave an insincere apology. I even blatantly said that this service was unacceptable and I had no intention of ever coming back to Destihl. His only response was that our table was finally ready. The manager made no attempt to make up for this horrible service, and walked away without a second glance."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and my little kid came out of me and got the French toast. The food was very good and I'd love to have it again.  The only problem I had with it was that it was rather loud.  We had a group of tables there and we couldn't hear people talking 5 feet from us. But that was only a minor problem, overall good restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times over the past 5-6 years and I have never had a bad experience! I love love looooove their brunch menu, the staff is always super sweet and I love the decor/ambiance. My favorite dish on the dinner menu is the Thai fried chicken, sweet, spicy and super filling! HUGE portion. I love to take it home to finish it later. As for the brunch menu, they have a dish called Croque Madame that is to die for! Think of it like a deluxe gourmet French toast. But the cheese is on the outside and there is a cayenne pepper spiced egg on top over easy. SO AMAZING. I also love that they serve their delicious coffee in clear glass mugs. So unique and cute!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff! I've been several times and look forward to going again. My favorite meal there is the pot roast and my favorite app is the fried bacon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"In town for Memorial Day weekend. Wanted to go someplace slightly fancy for dinner Saturday night. My wife picked DESTIHL, and she definitely chose ... wisely. :-)
We made reservations for 7PM. (They use Yelp for online reservations, and that was painless.) Got there at about 20 'til. (We'd taken a Lyft from the hotel, because we didn't want to worry about how much we had to drink, and it got there, and got us to the restaurant, much quicker than expected.) The hostess actually apologized for not having a table ready for us, and gave us a buzzer. So we headed into the bar to wait. Bar service was quick and cheerful. My wife had a shot of a very nice rye (Whistle Pig); I went with one of their many interesting beers, the I Believe You Have My Stapler red ale, which was a little hoppier than optimal for me, but clearly well-made. Before we could finish our drinks, the buzzer went off, and we were off to the dining room.
Service was prompt but not rushed, attentive, and both friendly and professional. We both went with items from the \"Signature Dishes\" section of the menu. My wife got the stuffed poblano pepper, with chorizo, I went with the pork posole soup. My wife was very pleased with her entree. I was completely blown away by mine. It wasn't a large quantity of food, but it was an IMMENSE quantity of TASTE, Every spoonful was packed with goodness. With our dinners we had a bottle of Robertson Pinotage. We were both amazed to see this fairly obscure varietal on their menu, and pleasantly surprised with how well it paired with both of our meals. After dinner we went ahead and split one of their wild sour berry tarts for dessert. It was another impressive piece of work ... a whole lot of moving parts that blended together magnificently.
We were so impressed with the experience that, after having dinner at another restaurant in downtown Champaign tonight, (Sunday) we decided to stop in to DESTIHL again for another drink at the bar. Ended up staying for two rounds. My wife had another rye (Templeton), and then a lovely Japanese whiskey, Hibiki. I stuck with their beers - first a great raspberry wheat ale, then an even better saison, their Neil St. Again, wonderful service. Just fun to hang out.
If we're ever back in Champaign-Urbana, we'll definitely come back to DESTIHL."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - lunch menu is much better than the night menu, IMO. 
Beers have consistently been unspectacular.  I'm not terribly picky, but there's just some little thing missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it. 

It also has the Champaign problem of being ludicrously overpriced for the size of the city.  That's kind of common around here, though, so I can't really fault them for that."}
{"text":"I love their beer, I mean really. The burgers are also good. However, I am not particularly impressed by their brunch menu. I don't mean that it is bad, just mediocre. 

But, I do like their beer, and for that reason I go there quite often."}
{"text":"This is a cute place in the downtown area of Champaign. It is always busy on the weekends and the service is good. My only issue was that the menu was kind of all over the place. There was traditional bar food mixed in with Thai as well as pasta dishes. Just didn't seem coherent to me I guess. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Wings, spicy, asparagus awesome, corned beef eggroll awesome. Let me tell you, that asparagus was insanely good a slight heart attack but insanely good so I will mandate that you give that sucker a try. The corned beef egg roll was well balanced and meatty! Yum!"}
{"text":"Down in Champaign for my little sisters graduation from the University of Illinois and we had a party of 13 for a post graduation meal.

The decor is pretty modern for your typical microbrewery and the staff was extremely nice.  Had to wait a little bit because of the size of our party but that was fine.

If craft beer is your thing, I think you would hit the jackpot with this place.  From sour to sweet there is a beer here for every beer drinkers palate.  I opted for no alcohol and had regular old iced tea.

The menu offers a lot of options from vegan dishes to burgers to pasta and an array of appetizers any bar/restaurant would have.  The nachos were ordered and just so-so, same with the cheese curds.  I like them a certain way and they just weren't to my liking.  Not bad tasting just prepared differently.  The warm pretzels were excellent.  Other options that earned good reviews at the table were the burgers, chop salad and the Mac N Cheese.

Would definitely make a trip back if I am ever down in the area."}
{"text":"A lot of people have already said exactly what I think - underwhelming. I've been to Destihl 4 times - the first time, I got the beer-battered cod. WOW! Amazing!! Everything about that experience was great! The past 3 times? Not so much. We always take out-of-town family there, and it's a disappointment. The portions are teeeeeeny tiny, so order plenty of appetizers. The value is not very good at all. 

The beer's alright. Champaign has better breweries. 

This restaurant has a lot of potential - it's already showed that. I always go there wanting to be wow'd, and they come up short."}
{"text":"This is kind of a go-to place with out-of-town relatives, the food is good if overpriced. Some dishes meh but i like the fish and chips.  Beer ok better than your low end brews. Nicely decorated service generally good."}
{"text":"Why does everyone hate it here?
It's not gourmet. It's a brewery that also serves food. But it's a brewery first.
Maybe I've gotten lucky. Maybe I just know how to order at a place like this (potato croquettes are great, pretzels are... pretzels - come on, cheese curds are okay, sandwiches are satisfying). I feel like if you're ordering something that you expect to be high-end here, you're just begging to be disappointed. 
Very good cocktail menu. Nice that they will fill growlers. More than likely there's something on tap you'll like. Good spot to come after work.
I always sit at the bar and I usually see people all around who seem happy - that tends to be a good sign in my book."}
{"text":"We were stopping in Champaign during a road trip and I am so glad we stumbled upon Destihl rather than noshing on Subway sandwiches from a gas station on the side of the highway. My husband enjoyed a few beers and tasters, and was glad to see that they serve great Destihl beers as well as other brands. I enjoyed that the wine selection was a bit more than what you'll find at many breweries. The food was delicious, and they truly have something for everybody. My husband got The Rancher burger and I enjoyed the Squash & Cashew Cream \"Zoodles\" - not often can you find a big juicy burger and healthy, vegan zoodle dish on the same menu! The only negative is that we don't have one closer to us!"}
{"text":"Beer:
Mostly sub-par. Their sours are generally above average to amazing. I have yet to have decent pale (pale, IPA, IIPA) here. They are mostly a trendy place to go eat and stare at tanks. Most beer geeks will be sorely disappointed. They also charge quite a bit for a growler of beer. A fair number of them are $30-$50...which is stupid for beer of this caliber.

Food:
The food is pretty good, but all the pretty things to look at in there cost money, which means the food is not cheap. The menu always has interesting choices and they will not let you down."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and delicious wines and beers. When I come to visit family in town I usually am desperate for really good food which I think is hard to come by around here. However this is my new go to place. I hope to make a convert of my dad, though I'm sure he'll complain about the prices."}
{"text":"Overall I was very impressed! A local restaurant with a lot of class. The place has amazing quality chefs and waiters, and makes sure to keep the menu fresh, continuously changing the menu.

When I went I had the Flank Top Steak. The prices were moderate for what I ordered, but when it came out, I was impressed with the plating! But that was minuscule adoration compared to the taste of the food. Absolutely delectable. 

I would recommend the place to anyone looking for a classy place to get great food and a full stomach. And if it's still available, you have to try the Beer Battered Bacon!"}
{"text":"Great, varied brews. Ceviche tostadas and stuffed poblano peppers were stellar. Great service.  Wish I lived closer so I could come more often!"}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite restaurant in Champaign. It isn't overly expensive, and they have enough options to keep us trying new things each time. We don't even drink and the food is enough to keep us coming."}
{"text":"We had dinner here awhile back for the first time in a few years. They've improved their menu recently and the variety is very nice - something for everyone.  They also feel higher quality. No more expensive pizza! We always enjoy the well priced, high quality beer. We ended buying a keg for a party which was a great value!"}
{"text":"Another fun new restaurant we tried in Champaign!  My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners.

This is a sleek, clean, modern space.  There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity.  We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us.  We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls, we all split them and liked them.  Both had a bit of a kick, the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely, I just drank some extra water.

Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey, soup is good food.  I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup, so light and flavorful.  I loved it!  With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea, it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice.  The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp (like me) you might want the guac on the side, that is where the heat was for sure!  I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco, it was just too picante for me!  I adored the rice, bean, corn side dish.  Just delicious!

For dessert, we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it.  It came with ice cream and it was just smooth, sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream.  I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one!

This was a very enjoyable meal.  The team had played lousy, my daughter is moving, I needed a culinary hug and this was it!  I would definitely come back but sadly it won't be with my youngest!  Why don't you meet us so I won't miss her?"}
{"text":"Good goat cheese and spinach salad along with a half and half. Havarty/Turkey sandwich and a cup of Tomato Cous Cous soup. Great glass of Wheat beer!"}
{"text":"Bartender guided my choices, and was spot on. Chorizo stuffed dates were just the right amount of sweetness, spice, and wrapped in fantastic bacon. The salmon and warm potatoes were awesome as for entree. I would have loved to try many more of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because the beer is good and the bartenders are friendly. They have a good knowledge of the beer, mixed drinks and the food. 

The skillet nacho is huge! So be cognizant of that. The beer battered bacon is delicious but how can it not be?
My first entree here was the rancher. I was curious about bison meat. The bartender was helpful in letting me know it was worth trying. Boy was I glad that I did. After all the ones I've had here, that's still the most memorable. 

The ambiance is a bar/brewery. A large place with tv at the bar. The outdoor seating gives you a good view of the show during the summer Friday street performances without the band playing so close it's deafening. 

Overall a good place to grab a bite. Not always the quickest but definitely enjoyable."}
{"text":"Modern, trendy and most importantly, DELICIOUS! 

Destihl is definitely among my  favorite in Champaign. I've been here multiple times and have never left disappointed. My taste buds and tummy agree.  

It's a good go-to, for anything from dinner to brunch; date or large group outing.
My staples for whenever I visit: beer battered bacon, cheese curds and the fresh berry napoleon. If you get a chance, check out the weekend brunch. They have a killer strawberry french toast entree that is to die for. 

Prices are a little on the higher end, relative to a college student's budget but overall, not too expensive. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and fast. The only downside is, it can get pretty crowded, especially during dinner/weekends/special occasions, so make sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"Got seated right away. Menu is a good mix of traditional and some unique items. I had the skirt steak. It was good, but didn't really care for the seasoning. However, it was prepared just as I asked. The BEST part of our experience was the incredible service. Alex is the best. We will ask for him when we return. All-in-all, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"As always we received fantastic service and had an amazing experience. The food was delicious, hot and quickly prepared. Our server was attentive and we never had an empty drink.

We had the beer battered bacon, swordfish tacos and bacon mac and cheese. All were delicions!! 

I will always visit Destihl when I'm visiting Champaign. =) Thanks so much for the great experience."}
{"text":"Nice brewery. They hav their own local beer to try. Just ordered some potato croquettes and they were no doubt pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Everything we had was really good. Bacon wrapped dates awesome and a little on the spicy side. (Loved it!) Chicken Blue cheese pizza, perfect crust and combination of ingredients. Banana pudding dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl \"Brewery\" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. 

Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. 

I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. 

To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above \"whisper\". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply \"eggs, bacon, and potatoes\" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. 

In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. 

By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, \"they are still working on it, should be out soon.\" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.

The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. 

Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. 

I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, \"Well, I am sorry.\"

To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. 

To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it."}
{"text":"Destihl my broken heart! I've had great food here, and great service in the past on several occasions but tonight was a disappointment. Our service was slow and inaccurate and the food quality was disappointing. Or maybe I just had high expectations because of previous visits when food and service were outstanding? I'm not sure.

I'm a three strikes and you're out sort of person, so I'm hoping Destihl gets back in the game."}
{"text":"I have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly! I love trying new things and I am never disappointed. 
My dad has helped them with a batch of beer, they have made Reese's vodka just for my mom and honestly, whenever I go with them to eat it's like I walk onto the set of Cheers. Everybody knows their name. 
But you don't have to be a regular to feel like you're getting special treatment. I love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging. I love the location, I love the feel... I just wish I had more money so I could visit them more often!"}
{"text":"Food was great!  After first hour of being seated and order taken, our appetizers never showed up.  Our meals instead came out.  While they were fine.  We were disappointed in the amount of time it took and apps never coming."}
{"text":"The bacon is great and the asparagus is amazing.  This is all I can say good for this place.  The wait staff always seems very busy standing in the corner chatting instead of checking on patrons.  I've given this place too many chances to be disappointed every time.  I even wrote a letter to the manager once to get an insencere apology.  Clearly nothing has changed as I am writing this sitting at the bar after being ignored for 20 minutes and counting with an empty glass on a very slow Monday night."}
{"text":"4.5/5 -- Great restaurant all around. Friendly, helpful waitstaff. Diverse and large menu of appetizers, meat, veggies, seafood, drinks, desserts, everything. I tried the shrimp ceviche (awesome summer dish), swordfish (delicious, yet small for a swordfish steak), fish and chips (delicious as well), and a cherry heffeweizen and a Hawaiian fruit beer to drink. Everything was awesome, tasty, and presented well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Unique recipes that are executed well and paired with great beer. More of a true restaurant that has a brew house vs a tap room."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch! I was so impressed that they had vegetarian and vegan options. And the item I ordered was delicious! I also had a Mai Tai that was bomb! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service here was really slow, however the food and the patio is very nice.  We were travelling with our dog and thankfully they allow pets on their patio.  

The fish tacos we had were phenomenal and the beer was quite tasty as well, however the fact that we had to wait so long for absolutely everything took my rating of them down a star.  They weren't busy, so I don't know what the hold up was."}
{"text":"Good margaritas 
Good meatloaf 
Good salad 
Good service
Kids liked their hamburgers
Good ambience 
I would eat here again no doubt. 
My wife had battered fish, she said great.
Her daughter had fish tacos, great."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday. The service was quite poor. After sitting down, we waited close to 25 min for our order to be taken and another 20 min for our food. Frankly, I was about to walk out but was swayed by the waiters candid apology. 

Focusing on the food, I ordered the Thai shrimp noodles. The presentation of the food was nice but for the price the serving size was quite disappointing. The noodles tasted okay but I might have been slightly biased given the poor service. For dessert, I got the carrot cake. The carrot cake was quite moist and soft. I recommend it.

Overall, poor service experience and above average food. Given that this is champaign, it is a nice casual sit down place."}
{"text":"Any draught beer from this place is a good options. Beer battered asparagus, veggie burger, Thai steak salad, or roasted beer salad you'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Champaign. It's a great place to take vegan friends. I recommend the warm potato and salmon (minus the salmon and add extra veggies for non meat eaters). I also love the vegan burger without the cheese. Their salads are good portions and are pretty tasty.

Lastly, the drinks are great. I love the sake lemon drop. I always request a homemade shandy with their strawberry blonde beer and lemonade."}
{"text":"It was super busy but that didn't stop the stellar customer service from the bar tender. I had the quesadilla with the strawberry blonde ale. Delish! I decided to appease my sweet tooth and got the lemon berry cake. A-MAZING. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Has an after meeting business dinner. Food was good and enough to satisfy. Beer selection and quality was ver good. Service very good, the wait staff attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow what a good looking staff! Amazing food, beer and service. Hands down the best place downtown. Bathrooms are on point also."}
{"text":"Really filling. Got the burger and was super satisfied. The beer battered burgers was overkill. Super tasty, super heavy. Decent price for what I got.

Really filling. Got the burger and was super satisfied. The beer battered burgers was overkill. Super tasty, super heavy. Decent price for what I got."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a night out. A little overpriced, but solid.  They royally botched my wife's wine order though.  She's a sommelier, too, so when they tried to tell her that there was sediment in her glass of white, hoo boy, school was in session :)  Regardless, it's a really beautiful place.  The decor is wonderful, and except for that one little detail, the service is excellent."}
{"text":"skirt steak is amazing have to try slightly spicy but great flavor. Brussel sprout salad has to right combo of sweet and sour. Topped off with cherry bread pudding 5 star for just that."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. The food was excellent and the service was superb. Came here on a whim for Father's Day. The beer choices are outstanding. The sour berry tart is refreshing and tasted great. Definitely recommend. They have choices for all including gluten free."}
{"text":"Pizza:  Chorizo & Mushroom.  Sandwich:  Cuban-Style Pork.  Beer.  Best Pink Moscato!"}
{"text":"I love Destihl! I'm not much of a beer person so I can't speak to their beer, but I love the food and the atmosphere. Very classy and the food is delicious. Great burgers and appetizers (the beer battered asparagus is BOMB), and good vegetarian options as well. I always brought my family here when they visited me at U of I."}
{"text":"The service here has been great! No complaints.

The beers are hit-or-miss -- I've tasted a couple that were PHENOMENAL and ended up in a growler purchase but some are subpar. Taste tests are in order!

The food is good, but nothing extraordinary -- on the thai salad, it would've been nice to have more than 4 slivers of steak but it tasted wonderful.  The pizzas are also tasty. 

Clean, inoffensive, and not terribly expensive."}
{"text":"I like Desithl! I've been here a couple of times and have had a lot of great bites. It's a nice place to try some good brews or to bring some friends to eat some food if they are coming from out of town. It's a large restaurant with a down to earth atmosphere.

In addition, they do some catered events too in a back private room which are really nice. 

Things I've liked that I've tried: 
- Thai Pork Pizza (get this!!!! I had this this weekend. So delicious. Juicy pork and interesting flavors from the lemongrass and jalapeno really give this a sweet and subtle kick)
- Banana cream pie. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmm. 
- Cheese curds - yes. just get these. 
- Beer battered bacon and asparagus: a simple way of eating all the things. 
- Bavarian pretzel - I love the cheese sauce!
- Chicken, bacon, blue cheese pizza - also very yummy to try and share! These pizzas are huge. 
- Four cheese bacon mac n cheese: my friend and I enjoyed the flavors and textures of this. This was among the first few things I tried here. Sold on bacon mac and cheese. They love their bacon here. 

I've tried their steak and lobster during their catered events too and this was pretty spot on. Of all the things I'd come back for--it'd probably be the thai pork pizza. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great food, good prices, generous portions, friendly professional service, and warm atmosphere. Had tempura-style asparagus for starter--tender and crunchy. Very tasty and unique. Ordered croque Madame from brunch menu and egg on top of the sandwich was cooked just right. My co worker insisted on ordering their carrot cake for dessert. Wow!  Crazy big and fresh. (My co worker also ordered personal sized pizza for herself. She loved her sausage and date pizza.). All around a very, very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here but I sampled almost all of their beers... and I loved them! You can either purchase the pint or the 4oz samplers which was a great way to try all their brews. I didn't have one beer I didn't like. The atmosphere was fantastic and the waiter was very informative about the beer. Another major plus was the bathrooms were private and exceptionally clean! If I'm in the area again I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker so I didn't try their beer. But I went there for food. And obviously it wasn't that good. It's not terrible though. If you are looking for food, I suggest try some place else."}
{"text":"This was the first time we decided to try one of the restaurants in the downtown Champaign and it was so worth it! The food was amazing and also looks beautiful. The atmosphere is really cool and you can see the brewery and the kitchen while eating. The portion size is also really nice, especially for what you're paying for. We'll definetly be back for more!"}
{"text":"Destihl is my go to place for a nice meal in Champaign, The environment is great. this is a must go for couples looking for a nice date. Their draft selection is great (obviously with a huge brewery inside the restaurant) they let you sample a few beers to try out what you like and they have awesome mixed drinks as well. I love their bloody mary (comes with salami, pickles, celery etc) its amazing (I love the spicy-ness of it). Honestly, the food was just okay. I've gotten this asian-ish dish before, a burger (eggs, bacon, wagyu beef) but i would much prefer Farren's, and appetizers. So yeah food is not too special but the drinks are good, waitresses are friendly (Michelle is AMAZING), and dessert is delicious. So honestly, I would come here (sit at the bar) get a few appetizers, drinks, and dessert."}
{"text":"We came with a large party (20) during unofficial weekend and we had to split up into two parties of 10, but it was busy so glad we could be seated.

Arelia was our waitress and was very nice, and was very easy to work with to split bills.

We got these vegetarian options:

Cheese curds:

They were OK. Main issue was that they were too small that it was more breaded exterior than cheese. Try it with ranch to make it a bit more flavor 

Poblano peppers:
Amazing dish! This is great for vegetarians and so much food! One pepper was enough for me and the flavor in the cheese/mashed potato/rice and beans combo was great. Favorite dish 



Chocolate cake:
Massive! Definitely can be shared by 4-5 people. Frosting was very tasty and cake was moist but not too moist.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got the fried egg and bacon burger.
Was cooked as asked. Maybe next time go lighter on the jab but overall it was good. 
Friend had the nachos and subbed the pork for chicken. Cheese is awesome. Maybe add some fresh jalape√±os next trip. Service was great! Would go back."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I preface this review is mainly for the food so I did not try any of the beer here. The food is okay, I can't say that it is amazing or that I crave coming here for dinner. It is also not cheap by any imagination, but this is one of the hot spots for dinner with the gastropub concept and microbrewery on site. The first time I came during a work function. I had the bavarian style pretzel. Nothing really exciting. Pretzel with cheese sauce or the IPA mustard. It sort of reminded me of the pretzels you would get at the amusement park. I ended up trying the most expensive item on the menu which was the espresso rubber ribeye 18 oz with bone in, chiptole espress bbq sauce, asparagus, and bacon truffle mashed potatoes for 30 dollars. Somehow the meat just does not match steak hour quality meat. You are expecting an angus quality steak, but somehow my ribeye had a huge chunk of fat in the middle. Good ribeye is marbled with fat to give it that amazing tenderness and flavor, this was not that. The espresso rubbed gave it sort of a burnt flavor. I can't say that I was impressed. The second time I came went with the beer battered bacon egg burger 14.50 that had angus beef, beer battered jalapeno bacon, bacon jam, along with a fried egg topped with smoked white cheddar cheese and a brioche bun. Somehow the batter of the bacon was super thick so you ended up having chicken tender size bacon on top of the burger. The blend of angus beef patty with bacon jam and fried egg is an amazing combo, but somehow the oil must have not been changed for the beer batter bacon. It was a very dark color and had a strong not so pleasant oil taste. If you like gastro-pub food you can give this place a try, but once again for the price you pay the food just falls short of that bar.

Pros: gastro-pub, lots of beer selection, quick service

Cons: not top quality protein, the oil may have not been changed for a while given the overused oil taste, expensive

Hidden deals:
Join the desthil guest reward program. I did not get offered this at my visit.

{"text":"I have to update my review. My family and I went here on a beautiful Sunday for lunch. We chose to sit outside. The food was delicious, all plates (yes I tried everyone's food) and the service was good. I usually have excellent service here, however, sitting outside I think we were sometimes forgotten. Overall, an improvement from my \"hit of miss\" idea of this place."}
{"text":"Service - poor they tried twice to bring the food we actually ordered before we gave up and ate what we got... Burgers were average, salad dry... Applebee's was great"}
{"text":"A restaurant that has it all. This is my favorite place in Champaign. It compares to some of the greatest restaurants in NYC and Chicago. The food is always fresh. The food is always flavorful. As a vegetarian, this place offers so many seafood and vegetarian options. Also, if you're a meat-eater, there are plenty of options. The waiters and waitresses are super accommodating - they are glad to sub out ingredients to meet your dietary restrictions. 
All the pasta's are great - but the best are zoodles (zucchini noodles) in a creamy, coconut sauce. Must try! 
The brunch is delicious as well! The eggs are cooked perfectly and paired with delicious cheeses and toppings. 
The restaurant is also great for families or small parties in addition to being a great place to celebrate a special occasion! 
One of the front hostesses is rude. Not sure if she knows how to smile. But the food here is so great that I just try and ignore her rude demeanor and attitude."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times to make sure it just wasn't a bad day.  Unfortunately it has always just been blah.

Good: Service was always fantastic, the other reason I am not giving them 1 star.

Bad: Not everything on the dishes are listed on the menu.  I ordered a grilled cheese and I got it with an onion marmalade on it, just caked with onions. Everything was always over salted and cold. The wait time for food was always way too long for my liking. The famous beer battered bacon I have heard so much about was burnt. Just overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick appetizer and beer after work and it was Wonderful.  Beer was fresh and tasty. Ordered the ceveche and it was AWESOME!!!  Great prices. Great atmosphere!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Good place for Sunday brunch. Had a delicious individual quiche paired with lightly dressed salad greens. Perfect portion size. Note: good coffee, too."}
{"text":"The staff was really awesome . I highly recommend coming here for the pot roast. The house brews are good too. Will definitely come back here to eat every time I'm in town.."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. Any entree you choose is amazing.  Keep up the great work.  Drinks are great as well.  Five stars all around"}
{"text":"FINALLY! We were all being teased for so long about when it would actually open! I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!

I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.

As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.

I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!

UPDATE!
So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.

All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!"}
{"text":"I like their beers and you can get samplers. They have some great dishes like the fish and chips, the salmon salad, and burger but stay away from the meat loaf."}
{"text":"We went to Destihl for dinner Monday night. The service was phenomenal. I believe our server was Dom- very thoughtful, considerate and joked with our kids. We ordered a few appetizers - ceviche on tostadas and the pretzels for the kids. My husband ordered the special which was the espresso rubbed ribs- delicious! I got the rainbow trout which sounded great on paper but was just okay. It had potato hash, which appeared crispy(how I like it) but it was soaked in the collard greens I didn't get to enjoy the contrasting textures. The boys got a PBJ sandwich and the other chicken tenders. Both kids meals came with root beer floats which they loved."}
{"text":"I usually love Destihl but tonight it was mediocre. They were incredibly nice on the phone when I ordered for pick up and accomodating when I asked for a substitution of spinach... However, my salmon and vegetables were incredibly over-salted and my s'mores dessert was comprised of marshmallows so burnt that there was hardly any there and the chocolate sauce wasn't melted all the way. I'm sure if I had eaten at the restaurant the food, at least the dessert would've turned out better but I wish it wasn't necessary to be at the restaurant to be happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Sitting here for 30 mins, no service come at all. No water, no one ask. 

It would be a surprise I would be here again!!"}
{"text":"Modem brew pub in downtown Champaign era. Went with a group of 6 people and we received great service. Started out with create your own beer flights. They do 4oz pours for $1.50 each and you can get whatever quantity you want which was really fun. I particularly liked the Champaign Blonde Ale and Guava IPA. 

For appetizer we got the skillet nachos which were amazing. Really cheesy and zesty and the pork on the nachos was really tender.

For the meal I got the bacon cheeseburger. It was pretty average by bar standards, but still enjoyable. I got the wedges as the side. They were great but they only gave 6 which was a bummer. Other note: my friends got the pizza and it was really soggy.

Overall great time though and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First, reserve a table if you're going at a busy time and want to sit in the dining area.

It was my first time at Destihl last night; I will probably go back.  

Destihl has a great beer selection.  I tried about four different beers, all of which were pretty tasty. 

The appetizers were so-so.  We tried potato croquettes and beer battered bacon.  The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless.  The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.

The main course were pretty variable.  My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion.  Though, it was fairly tasty.  I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.

The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order.  It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks.  Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar.  I expect better though.

Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working.  This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!"}
{"text":"Great decor & atmosphere, selection of beers, and creative foods. My problem is with the last... other than the fried asparagus, I haven't had good experiences with their menu. I've tried goat cheese & apple pizza, the black bean and Wagyu burger, soup, and so on. I really tried to hop on the fan wagon for Destihl. Maybe I need to try their stuffed peppers. We'll see if I ever want to go back!"}
{"text":"It is hard to pick what is the best about this restaurant: the handcrafted beers or the extraordinarily delicious food! The Dijon chicken is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"This is become one of my favorite places to dine in Champaign. Good prices, consistent cooking, good service, and not too busy on Sunday mornings. I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.

I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. 

The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.

Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.

Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.

The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.

I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.

I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.

The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers.  The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish."}
