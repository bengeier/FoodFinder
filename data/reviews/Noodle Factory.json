{"text":"Food was good we ordered dumplings 3 plates which went off fast as they were really good. For main dish stick to number 25, 26 , 30. Friendly staff only drawback which most of small restaurants have us they accept only cash"}
{"text":"No fuss, quality homemade noodles and dumplings. Quick and easy, cheap and delicious. I started with 4 shrimp & pork dumplings, which were quite good. The accompanying sauce was good, too. Then I had noodle and dumpling soup (broth wasn't very tasty - fixed this with hot sauce), which contained ALOT of noodles, green onions, cabbage and 6 delicious, fresh pork dumplings. All this for the modest price of 10.50 tax included. Seriously, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Go there at least once a week! The food is amazing and fresh. Service is fast and always with a smile at any time of the day!  The family that runs the place is very accommodating, welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Older looking facility. Could do with a renovation. The quantity of the food is good, but the food is flavorless and bland.   There is an old man serving and he is very rude, For some reason he is in a hurry even if the place is empty. He just slams the plates on glasses of water on the table and goes to a corner and stands like springed up wooden statue.  Some reviewers mentioned cracked bowls and plates. This is true. The cracks are probably caused by the old man slamming them on the table hard while serving.  There are better chinese restaurants across from this place. I would give this a skip and go across."}
{"text":"I must share this experience. This is the second time I went to this place because I remembered their noodles were flavorful. I did not enjoy the food because of all the oil! The texture stayed in my mouth and coated my teeth/gums till I got home and brushed. I understand it's Chinese fast food but I felt horrible afterwards. Instead of getting shrimp with noodles, I ordered chicken for the first time here and it was so strange! I set that aside and only ate the noodles. Texture of chicken did not feel real and was questionable  Not only was their food mediocre, the cashier/manager kept my money until I agreed to give a very generous tip to the 2 waiters that served us in a 5x10 foot restaurant! I was ready to give 15% as I am also in hospitality but this guy kept bragging about their reputation and how hard his staff works that I felt ashamed and gave in. Feeling super violated!"}
{"text":"Small diner atmosphere.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Very friendly staff.  Service was quick and the food was very flavourful.  Large portions too.  Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nothing to scream about, but that's not why you come here. This place is perfect for a quick, hot, and filling meal. No sooner had we ordered that our food appeared before us.  I especially liked the shrimp and pork dumplings which came hot and steaming in their bamboo baskets. You could order bigger plates (entree) which are meals in and of themselves, or a bunch of smaller bites if you want to sample more things. We enjoyed our meal here very much!"}
{"text":"En visite dans le quartier chinois de Montréal, nous nous sommes arrêtés dans ce restaurant à la façade simple et qui au premier abord ne donne pas l'envie d'y rentrer?!  Nous avons commandé une quantité de plat et nous nous sommes régalés?! Les raviolis pannés au porc étaient délicieux et les nouilles sautées style Singapore était épicée et très bonnes aussi?!  Bref, un bon repas pour un prix tout à fait dérisoire, comme toujours chez un bon restaurant asiatique?!"}
{"text":"Excellent portions and food tastes very authentic! There is a bit of wait, but you get to order while you wait in line!   We ordered shrimp dumplings, noodles and Chinese brocolli. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up..... if you're an attractive woman going to eat with girlfriends beware. The man serving the food can be very touchy. Its nothing bad but just be aware that it can happen. To me its just a side note considering the food is soooo good.  My favourites are still #7 and #20"}
{"text":"Went last night with a friend, and we were super disappointed that the hand pulled noodles weren't hand pulled... we asked of the servers at the end of the meal if the noodles that we'd ordered (#25 the acclaimed hand pulled noodles) had actually been hand pulled to which he replied \"yes, well, except sometimes they're not... ask to make sure we're pulling them before you order them.\" The sauce was fine but we felt really let down that they hadn't told us before the meal as we would have ordered something else (or gone elsewhere - which I suppose was their fear of telling us the truth)."}
{"text":"I ordered chinese pickle and pork slice noodle.  Taste is good but too oily.  Doesn't worth to try.   Service is very good. Maybe next time will try their steamed dumplings."}
{"text":"Do you love noodle factory? Your answer is YES? Than Noodle factory is for you.  I can say that I know lot of Montreal's Chinatown restaurants. These bistros, restaurants etc are not fancy though, which is good to enjoy their cultural food. But sometime, I can't really get what I want.  From all of them (considering only Chinatown), I love just one - Noodle factory - noodles, dumplings etc at great price in cosy familiar environment served on your table."}
{"text":"I liked the noodles but the flavor was less than expected. We also had the mini steamed bun which was ok. It was pretty good overall but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the weekend and stayed at a hotel nearby Chinatown. Decided to grab lunch at this place since it had good ratings on Yelp. Checked the time it opens on Yelp and even double checked on Google and it showed 11AM. I walked in around 11:05AM and the whole staff started screaming out the top of their lungs at me saying they are closed and to come back in 40 minutes. I asked, but it shows you guys are open at 11 on Yelp and Google...one of the workers proceeded to literally push me out of the door and told me to come back later....VERY RUDE and unnecessary."}
{"text":"This place is fairly overrated.  The staff is very friendly and service was extremely quick but the good ends there.  The prices are on the high side of \"$\" and the food is bland and unimaginative.  It was almost a chore to finish it.  The hygiene is also questionable - my bowl of rice was carried to the table grasped from above in such a way that the waiter's hand was touching the top of the rice.    Finally, this is a cash-only place with no warning signs about that on the door, so I had to run out and find an ATM after my meal."}
{"text":"One of the best places in chinatown for all your generic and authentic noodle needs. Noodles are made in house and have a better texture as a result. Their chow meins, noodle soups, meat sauce noodles, and soup dumplings are especially good. Price wise its not worth it to get dim sum here compared to their other dishes, but the har gao and shiu mai are decent too. Prices are very reasonable, and all the workers are really nice. I came in the middle of a pretty rough snow storm once near closing for takeout and they offered me hot tea and let me grab cash from a nearby atm while my order was being made."}
{"text":"Not a fancy ambiance but food is really good: Hunan dumplings, Steamed Chinese dumpling, Shanghai noodles, Stir Fried Singapore noodles  Recommend it and will go again"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Had much better chinese noodle soup. Maybe I ordered the wrong item, I may give it another chance. Friend had wonton on peanut sauce, that was pretty tasty. Overall cost performance was not bad, hence, 3 stars."}
{"text":"We were expecting and hoping for a lot when we finally got into the noodle factory- and they certainly delivered! For our non French speaking tired family of 6 with fussy little ones they were able to get us our food fast and with a free appetizer to boot. The portions were large and the prices were cheaper than the average restaurant we encountered during our stay. And the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly.  Place is small, but the food comes out FAST so the tables turn over quickly, but they don't make you seem rushed.  The homemade noodles are as pictured.  Lots of noodles, okay amounts of meat and few veggies.   The steamed dumplings were some of the best I've ever had.  Prices seemed more than fair for the quantities served.  Remember cash only as they do not take credit cards."}
{"text":"pretty good noodles, affordable cantonese family that i never had.  family owned. mom works the register, runs food, and cooks. thinking of hollering at her daughter. you know, help out the fam.  the son is actually the star of the restaurant, had a line of skinny boys out the door trying to get his number. i must admit, he's a hottie~~!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Huge portions, good food and super cheap. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"We stayed across the street and this was a perfect first stop after our lunchtime heck-in because we were starving. Food was hot, decently priced, arrived incredibly fast and hit the spot.   A great hole-in-the wall joint with amazingly friendly and gracious service. Dealt with our meltdown-prone toddler with aplomb (tantrums, spilled water and more) and humour. Seemed like a lot of regulars popped in (a bunch with children). Table turnover was quick! It's not the most adventurous menu, nor life-changing in any way, but it serves its purpose and knows its clientele well.   Staff spoke English, French, Cantonese and Mandarin -- I overheard one staffer say he spoke even more languages!"}
{"text":"Best noodles!  They are homemade, and they taste it. It makes a heck of a difference. Have any of the wide selection and you won't be disappointed. Prices are also very reasonable.  A bit crowded tho, so expect to wait a bit, and not be able to hang out too long after your meal"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside - an old building with a little red sign - nor when you go inside, as it is a small and cramped place that seems kind of disorganized and messy at first glance. However, the food and service here will astound you.  I went here with my father for lunch today and we were in a rush. We were led to a table and the menus were given right away. I quickly ordered spring onion pancakes as an appetizer and their stir fried handmade noodles with vegetables. The food was ready in five minutes, tops, but was still fresh and delicious. Their handmade noodles (that's why it's called the Noodle Factory!) are very tender and soft. They have rather low prices for generous portions of authentic Chinese food.  I definitely recommend this cozy restaurant for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Je fais toujours le détour quand je viens au centre-ville de Montréal, j'y vais simplement avec mon classique dumpling au porc frit et nouille au porc et concombre #10 et 19 je ne fais pas erreur, service rapide et personnel sympathique, vraiment.pas cher une de ces qualité! Chers!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim because of some Chinese food cravings. It's a really small place so if you want to come, come early.   The food is actually really good! We ordered everything to have less salt, and all the dishes that came out still had lots of flavour, without the super saltiness.   Beef rice noodle was my favourite, followed my Singapore style fried noodle, then the handmade stir fry noodles with beef. Caution about the Singapore style fried noodle though - when you order it less salt, there is also significantly less curry and spices added to it.   We also ordered the steamed soup dumplings but they were only so-so.   The staff were friendly and food literally flew out of the kitchen. Make sure you bring cash though - it's the only method of payment they accept.   I actually really liked this place and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Fast and courteous service, delicious food. If you're looking for fast, delicious Chinese in Montreal, this is where you want to go."}
{"text":"The Zhao Jiang Noodles (chinese spagetti) is amazing!  I go there mostly for that.  Always a lot of people there.    Thank you you (seriously, listen to the guy)."}
{"text":"this reviews is based on no 15 hunan pork dumplings and no. 49 Ma-Po Sauce Tofu.   the service was fast, the food tasted amazing, especially the dumplings with peanut butter sauce and the price was great, under 20$ for both.   will be back to try no. 13 steamed chinese dumplings and no. 38 szechaun shrimps."}
{"text":"Cool sliding door - transparent CHINESE kitchen for all to see and Fresh dumplings.  What's not to like about this unique place.  There's lots of choice of it but I really liked the vegetarian dumplings.  Wonton, vegetables and beef noodles were all delicious.    Everything comes out quick and of course the price is more than right.  Service is awesome and because you can see everything that's going on in the kitchen, it migt possibly be the cleanest chinese restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Food is weird and small size, cook with very dirty cloth, only cash acceptable and there is a old man who will ask for tips with a bad manner. Will never come again."}
{"text":"Didn't wait long for our food to arrive. Waiter complained about tip and was not appreciative. The noodles were drenched in MSG and soy sauce causing migraines. Dumpling casing was too chick and hard to swallow. I've had better don't believe the hype about this place"}
{"text":"The Restaurant Noodle Factory was a surprise!  It was a tiny place located away from the other restaurants, next to a massage parlor.  We went there only because it was directly across our hotel and we were too tired to walk any further.  At first, there wasn't a lot of people dining there, but by the time we left, the restaurant was packed.  I guess we were lucky to have beaten the dinner crowd.  The seating was tight, but the restaurant was clean and bright.  You are able to watch the chefs at work.  We ended up ordering more food than intended--vegetable dumplings, stir fried bak choi (tender all the way down to the bottom of the stems), General Tso's chicken (crispy, but not sopped with oil, and the chicken was tender, not overcooked and tough like a lot of places that have this), Singapore noodles (great taste though you wouldn't have expected it from its simple appearance).  We also ended up getting the mapo tofu.  Although we weren't used to seeing peas and carrots in this dish, where we live, everyone loved the flavor.  Most dishes are under $10 and a few go up to $12.  What I liked about the food here was that it wasn't overly salty or oily.  Despite the fact that we probably ate a little too much, we didn't leave feeling weighed down by grease and fillers.  Our stomachs would agree that we filled them with delicious and fresh food.  Oh, and the staff is very helpful here.  One person, maybe the owner (?) was especially eager to tell us where to find the foods that Montreal was known for.  Too bad we spoke with him too late, on the last evening of our visit.  We will definitely make it a point to return to this restaurant when we are in the neighorhood again."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for cheap and amazing Chinese food. The price is right and it's the best Chinese restaurant I've eaten at so far."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasty and good noodles and dumplings. Can't beat the price for such a good meal. Nothing fancy. No alcohol"}
{"text":"We took the Metro to go to the old town after visiting the St. Joseph's Oratory in the morning.  When we got off the Metro and noticed we were so close to the Chinatown so we tried to eat there.  We followed other people walking towards Chinatown and we went into the fist place because we were so hungry.  We did not check on Yelp for rating.  The place was packed so we took the 1st available seat.  It is \"cash only\".  I ordered #16 wontons noodle soup $5.50 and my daughter ordered #13 steamed Chinese dumplings $7.50.    The portion of other people was very huge.  Most the people ordered some kind of noodle dish without soup.  A lot people eating at the restaurant by himself/herself.  This is not a place to bring smell kids or family because the seating were super close.  My noodle soup came quickly while the steamed dumpling took a little more time.  My daughter was so impressed by the cook in the back because she had a seat facing the kitchen.  My wonton noodle soup was bland and her Chinese dumplings were not up to standard.  The one you buy from the Chinese grocery frozen food section was a lot better back in Chicago.  I think we did not ordered the right dishes at this place."}
{"text":"Mon endroit de prédilection pour satisfaire mes craving de dumplings. L'endroit est tout petit et n'est pas nécessairement attirant visuellement, mais il faut savoir voir plus loin que les apparences! Le service est hyper rapide, les prix sont dérisoires et la bouffe est délicieuse et authentique."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly services.  Fast and delicious.  Was a freezing day and the minute I sat down they welcomed me with tea and soup.  Amazing food and huge plates!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant right outside the underground tunnels in Chinatown. We spied it on our first night in Montreal and it was the perfect place to go to in the middle of Hurricaine Irene because we barely had to go outside!    In any event, the food was great.  The beef Chow Foon was some of the best I've had and the prices were incredibly reasonable.  Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekend and lined up for about 15min. I noticed the restaurant was filled with Caucasian customers which I unfortunately didn't notice until I was already seated - made me feel like the place was not popular with Asian people who have tougher standards with this type of cuisine. Come on, you all know it's true. *Steamed Chinese dumplings: Much to my joy the waiter confirmed that these are \"Xiao long bao\" (soup dumplings). There isn't much broth in it but they're loaded with very flavourful meat. Not the best soup dumplings I've had but they're loaded with meat which made me happy. *Wonton (pork) noodle soup: Decent effort at this classic Cantonese dish. I only tried a spoonful of broth and it was light yet savory at the same time, and didn't taste too much like canned broth. Another member of my table had this and I didn't try any but he said it was good. *Noodles with spicy vegetables & pork: The least impressive dish of the bunch - nothing \"spicy\" about this and the sauce was not salty enough for my liking. *Pork & spicy vegetables noodle soup (with handmade noodle): Nice chewy texture of the  handmade noodles. Broth is nicely flavored with less spice than I would have liked. Friendly service otherwise, and it looks like they charged no tax (but are cash only - you get what you pay for). Keep in mind, not only am I Asian, I grew up on Toronto - so with that experience in mind I feel this place is not amazing but it is okay."}
{"text":"Ambiance is poor. Like a fast food place. Server was very rushed and almost pushed us into making a choice. Sweet and sour soup tasted bad.  But as a positive, the vegetable noodles were just awesome. Best I've ever had. Also had flat noodles with vegetables. Not as good. Kids were disappointed and regretted not ordering two of the former dish.  I would return just because of the vegetable noodles."}
{"text":"I got the #23 veggie noodle soup and #7 shrimp steam buns and was underwhelmed. The noodles were similar to those of cho mein, not what I was expecting, but the portion was large for the price! The buns were good and simple but again underwhelming. Everything did seem very healthy which was nice!   With 4/5 on Yelp I was expecting more. It's okay but there are some amazing places for noodles and soup on st Laurent in Chinatown. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.   Maybe the meat dishes are amazing, I wouldn't know! The staff is very nice and the dishes came quickly!"}
{"text":"Small cozy place, owner is a superb guy and the service is great. Food was alright, I've been there only once so I cannot say a whole lot, but the noodles were indeed made by hand which tasted great. In addition, dishes are very economical so don't expect it to be so high-end, just enjoy."}
{"text":"Id steer away from the dumplings, especially the seafood ones. they were very doughy and tasted very much like imitation seafood. however, the handmade noodles are out of this world. i was very happy with my noodles with chicken. great flavor, huge portions, and very cheap. not to mention, the food came out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Cash only establishment. Family owned. Good comfort food, very fast service. Just what we needed on a rainy, cold night."}
{"text":"Idéal pour manger lorsque l'on visite le vieux Montréal. En effet, cela permet de manger pour moins cher que les prix proposés dans le vieux Montréal. La qualité est pas trop mal même si j'ai connu meilleur. Service sympa"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The staff were friendly and outgoing, the portions large and inexpensive, and though there weren't many tables, the wait isn't too long. Great place for hand-pulled noodles."}
{"text":"Great portions, very reasonable prices, very good food.  My mom and I stopped by yesterday for a late lunch. We ordered two appetizers, three pots of dim sum, and steamed rice... the entire bill came to be 24 dollars! Dumplings were very delicious, food came out quickly, and the waiters were some of the nicest people I've ever encountered. Great place, just missing a star because they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"This is a no fuss place for noodles and chicken sides with an open kitchen concept. The space is small, with tiny two-seater tables and plastic tableware. The place is eternally busy, and with cosmopolitan crowd - that indicates that the food suites varied kinds of taste-buds! Food is really tasty, super-fresh right from the wok to your plate! Menu has a decent collection of appetizers, (dimsums/wontons/ spring rolls), noodles, rice and entree meat dishes. We ordered spring rolls, dumplings, noodles, some chicken entree gravy (forgot the name) - each of them were tasty and fresh! If you aren't too fussy about cleanliness, ambiance and decor, this should be a must try."}
{"text":"This used to be a place specialised in noodles and dumplings back then but they seem to have changed. It now serves general tao, chow mein and all the other usual chinese fast food dishes. They still kept some of the old items on the menu. We tried the zhajiang noodles, the wonton noodles, the onion pancake and the dumplings. Their zhajiang was bland, the noodles were sloppy with no chewiness and the other 2 tasted like frozen food.   As for the service, it was very quick. The place is very small but with a service that fast, customers come and go pretty quickly."}
{"text":"So many Chinese/Viet restaurants in Montreal's Chinatown ,but this hole in the wall is something special.  PAN FRIED PORK DUMPLING - The STAR dish of this restaurant here! Excellent flavor with a thick fried skin. Pair that with a sweet dumpling sauce and it's such a cheap dish for a meal.  Onion Pancake - I think the menu had called it a crepe and it's not your typical scallion pancake you're used to. They almost look like crepes stacked and fried on top of each other so you get a nice thick crunch biting into them.  Pork Soup Dumplings #13 - aka Xiao Long Bao (not formally called that on their menu). Unfortunately I have to compare coming from NY where there's places that out perform this quality. You get 9 pieces but they're small and not filled with enough soup as I'm used to. They stick together in the steam container and the skin is thin. When you try to peel a piece it ends up ripping the skin and spilling the soup out. Overall it's very picky of me, but the flavor of the pork is still there at least.  Service is super friendly too. Well worth a visit and don't forget, CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and portions were definitely adequate! My only complaint is the service, where servers stood above your table and almost watched you eat your food. Made me slightly uncomfortable, but food was still good.  Warning: Restaurant is cash only!!!"}
{"text":"We got to Montreal at night and were very hungry! I wanted to have noodle soup at that time bcoz it was cold though I'm not a fan of Chinese food. But I was glad to be there and appreciated for their warm welcome with nice service!! During the meal, the waiter came to ask me for filling the soup that i was almost finshing it (as I said I was very cold) I never got asking from any chinese restaurants before. That made me surprised and impressed. I tried to get cold water by myself bcoz it was close to the table (we got tea already) I didnt want to bother them. The older waiter saw me, he stopped me!! and told me to let him fill up ice for us first. Nice! They kept checking us and smiled all the time though with other customers. After done, I asked for a container to pack the left over bcoz the dishes were large. I thought they would give a container same as usual when we ask in most of chinese restaurants...but he said he would do it for me. All aboved, if you dont mind about decoration much, here is another place to fill your energy, reasonable price, nice service and good for take-out! They made me enjoy Chinese Food much!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get five stars for being a fancy establishment - it gets all five stars because they're quick, have great noodle selections, and I always enjoy coming back here.  It's very close to the Holiday Inn Select and probably my favorite stop for food.  Nothing is too far off from $10 a dish and there is enough for more than one person each dish.  I've had their meats last year and all of the best noodles (hand pulled noodles with sauce and Singapore noodles).  It's everything I love about Chinese noodles and dishes.  What's even better is that you can order it and receive your dish 10 minutes later.    The restaurant itself is small so I wouldn't bring a big group of people but they do go through all the tables quite quickly.  Take out is always a great option.  Also, their spicy oil sauce is really amazing - flavorful and not the spiciest but has that kick that goes well with their food.  I bought one to go with me because it's made quite well (it's $5 a jar and worth your money if you love spicy sauce!)"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It's a no frills Chinese spot with great food. The service was great, I had 10 minute wait time, which was nothing. Go for the Shanghai noodles."}
{"text":"We came for early lunch with warm welcome from the staff. Delicious food that filled our hungry stomach from the chilly weather. Thank you !"}
{"text":"Cheap food, but most of the dishes I've tried are way too greasy and that ruins it for me.  I would go there all the time if every dish I ordered wasn't swimming in oil.  Even at that price there is better in Chinatown.  It doesn't matter if the noodles are homemade if you're mostly just slurping oily sauce while eating them.  The peanut dumplings are pretty good!"}
{"text":"What's the big deal? The noodles were bland and tasted like they came from a box. The vegetarian dumplings tasted and smelled like old water. The only delicious item was the crispy onion, which was flaky and oniony. Nothing else lived up to the hype. (Yes it was cheap, but I've had much better cheap Chinese food)."}
{"text":"Somehow the pictures posted here do not match reality. Went with a group of friends and ordered a bunch of things from the menu, all 'meh'.   The shrimp and pork dumplings were tiny and not fresh at all. The soup dumplings were shrunken and also not fresh. Hot and sour soup was bland. We ordered a bowl of noodles with meat sauce that was okish.   All in all, the food looked like it was all pre made and stuck in a freezer for months. At least it was all fairly cheap. Sad because I did very much enjoy the owner's hospitality."}
{"text":"Good home cooked food, reasonable $, easy to find, only take cash...generous portions, attentive staff, arrive early as it fills quickly"}
{"text":"Great overall experience. I had the pork dumplings and they were great. Not the best, but very good.  The place is a small place with a warm, authentic feel to it. As you step in, you have this \"family owned\" vibe.  The place very clean, you can see in the kitchen at every spot in the dinning room. The staff is prompt, polite and bilingual.   This place is a safe bet. :)"}
{"text":"I saw this place in tv and went... and kind of disappointed. It's very dirty but no surprise since it's in China town. Food is great and portions are big. It's very cheap too. However, the workers kept asking me questions so it was annoying. Since it's dirty it makes me wonder how clean the foods are... I found a piece of something in our noodle. Also, the server touched the end of our food when serving. so I'm done with this place. the seat and chairs.. I had to clean with my own sanitizer wipes. Overall, food was big and good but I don't want to risk my health. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a mixed vegetable noodle soup. It's too sweet and oily to me..plus, the bowl is broken...omg.."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and consistently good value.  The noodle soups are tasty and filling, the shanghai noodles are delicious, the pan fried and steamed dumplings very good!"}
{"text":"This place is small but full of great flavor. The noodles I ordered were made in house and amazing. I was so glad to find this restaurant for my family and I while on vacation. The vegetables were also really fresh."}
{"text":"Very good compared to most of the other Chinese food restaurants around the area.  I've been three times now and the place always seems to be busy.  The Cantonese style chow mein was awesome and decently priced.  For 9$, you get a huge portion loaded with lots of meat and the noodles were nice and crispy.  They also have xiao long bao (soup dumplings) which were not the best, but are hard to come by in Montreal.  Overall a good place for lunch/dinner to satisfy your Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"So DIRTY and terrible. Rude staff. Waiters are all scratching their heads or biting the skin off their fingers.   Oh GAWD no. Not eating here."}
{"text":"Really nice food, very generous helpings, courteous and friendly staff. Overall a great little place!   The soup dumplings were especially tasty!"}
{"text":"The staff is the nicest here. Even if you're getting something to go, they give you a table and water while you wait.   The restaurant is small but I've never had a problem getting a table. The menu is varied and fun.  The food is delicious, I love it so much. I want to eat everything but I can't. The first time I came here I ordered 10 extra spring rolls for myself, that's how good they were.  I highly recommend this place, it is my number one for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Mushy vegetables and about $2 more than other restaurants in the area.  Tables are close together, place was uncomfortably warm while I was there.  I felt rushed.  Not the worst Chinese food ever, but there certainly have to be better options around (I hope)."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch after going to the beer festival. The food was good, there was a bunch of it and service was fast. Exactly what you want when you are several beers in."}
{"text":"Quintessential Cantonese food. Everything is freshly cooked to order. Standard variety of noodle dishes ( get you don't mess with the good old standards). Staff is friendly fast and efficient. Portions are large. We found the noodle dishes to be better than the dim sum."}
{"text":"Okay for the price. Would've given 3 stars but they do not accept cards. Had to withdraw from the nearby CIBC for a fee."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more in terms of the quality of the food. the dumplings were average. The noodles were good and the service was very good. very quick. no ambience. I would try something else if I were to be back in the area."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had wonton soup and hubby had hot and sour. Both were hot and delicious. The dumplings and rice noodles were wonderful.  This is a small, cash only restaurant. Definitely worth a stop in Montreal."}
{"text":"The best Singapore fried noodles I have ever had . Great portion size and fast service . It is unfortunate they only take cash but they had no worries with me leaving to go get some money down the street at the bank. Next time I am back in the area I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"One of my friend's boyfriend works in the Old Port and he loves this place for a quick meal before going back to work.   After going to the movies, he offered we go there for a late snack.   Even though this place is called the Noodle Factory, he says their specialty is dumplings. We ordered three kinds and \"shared\": steamed seafood (my choice), steamed vegetables (my friend's) and steamed pork with peanut butter sauce (her boyfriend's).   The plates and the dumplings were huge. I think there were at least 8 dumplings per plate. I couldn't eat them all. Of course, I prefered the seafood, but the pork with the peanut butter sauce were quite good too. I didn't like the vegetable ones, but that's okay. My friend really wanted to eat something healthy.     Also, they did a \"last call\" before closing the kitchen, which was around 10:30 or 11PM. Don't get in after. Even if there are customers, they won't serve you.   Price: $25 for the three of us. On average, I think the dumplings were about $7 each, which is a good price."}
{"text":"A friend just introduced me to this place over the summer. This is a great place to go if you are in the area and hungry for noodles. Inexpensive check. Yummy food check. Quick service check. However the staff is so quick, it feels like they are trying to shove you out the door before your food is served. If you're in need of a fast lunch this is the place to go."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Small.  Always lined up and for good reason.  Great food.  Great prices.  I need say no more."}
{"text":"So with so many options is this area I decided to check this place out. Luckily it was a real win,win. The service was great, food was tasty and It all came out quickly. Not the mention large portions and an affordable price. I had the Shanghai noodles and pork dumplings and this fat boy couldn't finish It all. So when in the mood for noodles this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"An inexpensive, quick place to take the kids.  The portions are large and tasty. I felt a little rushed so it's not the kind of place that you linger.  The soup bowls were huge."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after wandering around Montreal for a while.  Located in the center of Chinatown and near the convention center, Noodle Factory is a small restaurant with only a few tables and a small menu.   While they may make their own noodles, they do not hand throw the noodles like some places I have seen.    I had the Shrimp stir fried noodles and an order of the the shrimp dumplings.   The shrimp noodles were good, soft noodles stirred with a good portion of shrimp and baby bok choy; the noodles were a bit soft and the dish could have been seasoned a bit more.   The dumplings were very good, with great flavor and an excellent texture to the dumpling wrapper.  Service was good and the food came up extremely fast; Noodle Factory provides good food in big portions at a reasonable price.  The decor is nothing special; be aware that they do not take charge cards, so have cash."}
{"text":"Simply great food.  Service is great and everything was delicious.  We had #10 fried dumplings and the imperial rolls for starters.  General Tao Chicken had a very favorable sauce.  Spicy pork and vegetable soup was excellent but if you want it really spicy just add some of the hot sauce in the container at the table."}
{"text":"So not worth walking 1 mile to this joint from my hotel!  I ordered a bowl of shrimp soup noodles and asked them to add some wontons and charge me extra. The noodles were too soft.  You can just swallow them without using your teeth! Wontons were small and a few.  So were the shrimp. At least there was plenty of vegetables.  The price tag: CAN$10.52 with all the taxes.  I can do a lot better in my own neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you want quick Chinese food this is the place to go. We were seating immediately and placed our orders within 5 minutes. Our food came out roughly 10 minutes after. Fast service is definitely one of selling points here. We ordered the Cantonese chow mein, shrimp fried rice, pan fried pork dumplings, and spring rolls. Decent food and quick service."}
{"text":"Morning home made noodles, best hot & sour soup in town and mapo tofu! Love this place, staff is friendly, not pricey! Really good!"}
{"text":"Kind of funky place, needs update. Plates are good size for money but lacks flavor. Fast service nice staff but just not a good"}
{"text":"I came here because of a lot of great reviews, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I think their Chinese food is catered towards a foreign crowd. I didn't like the soup dumplings or jajianmian that much, but quite liked the fish stir fry."}
{"text":"I was staying near the Palais de Congress for a conference and needed somewhere to eat that was cheap and convenient. I found this place on Yelp the first night, and we returned every night for 3 nights. The food is good, it's incredibly cheap, the service is fast and friendly...it just can't be beat, and believe me we tried. #30 the Stir fried Singapore style noodles were my absolute favorite (spicy but delicious). Also good were the stir fried hand made noodles, steamed Chinese dumplings, and crispy spring onion pancakes. Next time I'm in Montreal I will definitely be swinging by this place again."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I haven't seen this place before, but I'm pretty glad I did! Another handmade noodle and dumpling joint in Montreal! It was about 7:45pm when I go there it was still quite busy, so I decided to take my order to go. I will have to come back for a dine-in experience.  I got a spicy handmade noodle soup and the soup was tasty, noodles were good, but I suspect they would have been much better had I eaten them straight away and the spicy was not a kick-in-the-face spicy but something that warmed the soul. The prices are super and portions were big, I split my meal in two! Oh and service! I asked how long it might take and he said less than a minute, and I'd say that I got everything in 2 minutes (1 minute and 25 seconds to pack it and take my money!) Looking forward to my second visit!"}
{"text":"After a sub-par afternoon dumpling fix around the corner, I still had this dirty Chinese food craving to satisfy before the day was over--plus I don't feel like cooking tonight, so I stopped in at this place which is perfectly located in my opinion; kind of on the edge of Chinatown and just a head above street level. It's not huge inside either, which lends itself to spontaneous takeaway enthusiasts such as myself today. The staff were very friendly and spoke Cantonese with me. They knew what they were doing and had good knowledge of the small but generous menu. I ordered spring onion pancakes, Shanghai noodles, and sweet and sour pork to go. These guys are professionals--I had my food ready to take away with me within 7-8 minutes and everything tasted pretty good. The quality of meat they used for the sweet and sour pork could be better but that's not what you go to a place like this for! I might have found my new quick, cheap-enough, and easy Chinese (comfort) food fix in the city!"}
{"text":"You know, every once in a while, I am pleasently surprised.  I like food... and I like Chinese food the best.  I may not be Chinese, but I know what has good flavour and what does not.  My wife and I thought we would try this place out on a recent trip to Montreal.  Glad we did.  Nothing I ate was greasy - including the crispy rolls. Was the service the best?  Was the place kind of cramped?  Would I have preferred my soft drink in a big glass rather than a can?  Yeah, I guess those things could be improved, but for my my money, this place has some really great tasting food.    PS: Cash only - not a big deal because there is a CIBC and HSBC only seconds away, but it was not obvious to me on the web site."}
{"text":"Straightforward Cantonese style fast food. Food is fresh and seasoned well like what we're used to in NYC. We ordered the soup dumplings, chicken Li menu, Singapore chow mei fun, and general Tso's chicken. Nothing fancy, just good. I have them an extra star for the good service and for inviting the lion dancers in for good luck!"}
{"text":"Fresh noodles, dumplings and wontons= yummy lunch.  This place is the restaurant front of a real noodle factory so you know their noodles have to be good- and they are!  We ordered the shanghai noodles with chicken, along with a big bowl of spicy pork w/ noodles & slivers of cucumber.  We also got 2 different types of dumplings- peking ravioli lightly fried, steamed smaller dumplings w/ a peanut sauce, and 2 types of dim sum (har gao shrimp dumplings and pork shumai).  Great value- large portions for under $10 per dish, the dim sum was under $4 each. I was starving so I would have eaten anything, but the food here is great!    Very small- only about 6-8 tables with an open kitchen.  The location on the edge of Chinatown is convenient- near the Place de Armes metro stop.  This place is cash only so make sure you have some on hand to pay the bill!"}
{"text":"After eating below-par sushi at the Palais de Congres for lunch the day before, I decided to venture out into the cold for some better food. This place was fast, relatively inexpensive, and pretty good.  I got the Shrimp Dumplings (#3) and the Xiao Long Bao (Pork Dumplings #13) for lunch which was $11 and change. My food was ready in a little over 5 minutes. Both dumplings were good, my only complaint was that the skin was a little bit on the thicker side on both of them. The filling in both of them were flavorful. On the pork dumplings, there was not much soup inside them (I'm used to more broth / soup inside).  All in all, a good lunch place if you're around the Palais de Congres - it's only 1.5 blocks away. Cash only, and a very small space - it gets crowded for lunch but the food comes quickly."}
{"text":"Cheap, average broth, noodles are more often than not oversoaked by the time they serve you. Too much salt and msg. Average portion.  I would eat there in a pinch (and indeed i have, several times), but there are just so many other better options in China town"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and great service. The servers here are very friendly and accommodating. Service was quick and food tastes great. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants great Chinese food in MTL. :)"}
{"text":"It's really a shame as this COULD be good. but it's not.  The plates and cups smelled like javel.  We had no service whatsoever and nobody seemed to talk english nor french. They were obviously annoyed by our lack of mandarin. I speak three languages lady, i'm doing the best I can!  we ordered a selection of different dumplings and she kept showing us other things on the menu like she wanted us to change our order. No, i want dumplings, DUMPLINGS.  When we finally got them, they were very good, all of them. Well steamed and very tasty by themselves. I didn't try the sauce they brought as there was suspicious looking crumbs or disgusting bits in it."}
{"text":"Some things are delicious, others not bad at this tiny friendly hole in the wall in Chinatown. First and foremost though the staff are super nice here. Everyone always seems happy and well fed. A solid lunch spot with big portions and yummy classics like the peanut dumplings, imperial rolls, but I'd say avoid the noodle soups. For me at least on a recent trip the noodles were a bit soggy and the noodle to soup ratio was out of control. Noodle overload at the noodle factory. I'll be back though, it's one of those places."}
{"text":"Found the recommendation for this little place in Fodor's travel book. DID NOT disappoint! The best general tao chicken I've ever had and the pork friend dumplings were delightful. I'm just sad that I don't live here so I can get the meal again. Small place, cash only, very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, now I consider it a cheap, quick meal in Chinatown.  1. The noodle table is hardly used now for the noodle \"master\" to make noodles. It is only another kitchen counter.  2. I thought they cooked everything there (the kitchen right next to the dining room, behind the glass), but they actually have 3-4 more people cooking downstairs in a sort of secret kitchen (no wonder meals are ready so quickly!), so the only thing they do in the upstairs kitchen is mix stuff in the wok. I only came to realize this once the window was open during a \"canicule\" this summer (yeap, poor people who work downstairs).  3. I have been there at leat 30 times in the last 5 years and quality is consistently declining. On the bright side I can say that I really like the owner and one of the waiters. They are always nice to me, so service is great (most of the time) but food? meh..."}
{"text":"From the outside, this tiny eatery doesn't look like much. The signboard is not too eye catching. Many who have been taking lunch around Montreal Chinatown for years may not even have noticed it. This place first caught my attention only because of the lunchtime queue waiting to get in.   The noodles are very tasty. There is a wide variety, either fried or in hot soup. I especially recommend the \"zhajiang\" noodle. They are infused with a certain home-cooked goodness. Apart from the noodles, you can choose stir fried dishes and a selection of dumplings.   Perhaps what is most pleasant is the excellent service we got. The two servers we had were polite, cheery and prompt. Food was served up very fast.   Just one word of caution: During lunch time, because of the queue at the door, you will feel compelled to finish up quickly and move off. On the bright side, you'll get grateful looks when you do so!"}
{"text":"Tried the beef chow fun, hand-pulled noodle soup and peanut sauce pork dumplings. Was directed here by the good reviews so was expecting too much I guess. Really wasn't impressed by the food. Might try other dishes one day but didn't stand up to our expectations. The noodles in the soup were soggy and overcooked, even before the broth cooked them more. The dumplings were too sweet-- tasted like peanut butter and honey on wontons.. very strange. The beef chow fun tasted more like a pad sew that you'd get at thai express. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Petit resto très sympathique à proximité du métro Place d'Armes. Ils offrent la meilleure soupe \"sweet & sour\" en ville. Leurs dumplings sont délicieux et leurs nouilles fait maison valent TOTALEMENT le déplacement.   ** petits conseil: Éviter l'heure du lunch car ils y a beaucoup de bureaux a proximité, mais dans tous les cas l'attente vaut le coup ;)"}
{"text":"hand made noodles. fast. great service. open kitchen. Need i to say more?  There was a line up when we got there, but it moves pretty fast (approximately 10 mins wait). As soon as the server sees you there waiting, he offers you a glass of water.  Staff is extremely friendly and nice. Service is really fast. Even faster when you speak chinese to them.  My boyfriend and I had ordered the soup dumplings, sweet and sour veggie pork noodle and a beef noodle. The soup dumplings were good, as they are made on the spot. The veggie pork handmade noodle was really good. The beef noodle, not so much.  They are definitely known more for their handmade noodles.   Will be returning the next time I'm in town to try the spicy noodle and shanghai noodle everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"I like the people working there, so sweet! We even got a soup on the house. They made a mistake with our order (put beef instead of chicken - so maybe be careful to double check your order) but the food was great, and quite tasty, and they gave us a free dish the next time because of their mistake the previous time, so their customer service is very good! Also, with the limited options for tasty authentic asian food in Montreal (at least compared to Markham where I'm originally from) I'm always happy to find another good restaurant to add to my list of options."}
{"text":"I'm a Chinese from NYC.  Don't expect too much from the restaurants in the china town here.   Food were \"okay\", service was great."}
{"text":"Short version: there was sand in my dumplings and the server tried to use their hands to pick them out. When I complained about it they lied and said the sand was \"part of the vegetable.\" DISGUSTING! and Dishonest.  The whole story: My wife and I were craving some dumpling and authentic northern Chinese noodle when we saw this place. They had a bunch of news clips on  their window showing that their owner was a master noodle maker. I don't know if the owner changed or something, the current owner is obviously not that noodle master in the news clips. He was speaking Cantonese. I ordered some steamed dumplings and a bowl of sour-and-hot soup. The soup was good but very small, the portion was not worth $2.75.  While drinking my soup I noticed one of the female servers in the kitchen trying to pick something out of a plate with her fingers. This was disgusting to see, but I had no idea what they were picking. When my dumplings arrived, there were strange black spots on more than half of them, but not the other half. So I asked the male server (yes, the one other reviewers mentioned who is touchy with girls) what the black spots were. He said \"vegetables\" and walked away. So I took a bite into one of the dumplings. There was no black spots in the dumplings, just pork and cabbage. So I asked the female server what the spots were, she said they came from the bottom of the pot. I told her they are hard grainy sand and picked one up to show her, she did not even want to see what the spots were, I think she obviously knew, that's why they were trying to pick it out with their fingers.   I don't care if they want to put sand in their pots. This is a dishonest restaurant because: 1. The noodle master is not there any more, but they still use his name 2. Disgusting finger picking in the kitchen 3. The male server tried to lie by saying the spots are vegetable.  Avoid this restaurant unless you don't care what you are eating.  BTW, they use a lot of MSG"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I wasn't a huge fan of asian food to begin with, but this place converted me. It doesn't look like much, there's something like 8 tables inside. It doesn't try to flash or appear fancy, it's there to feed you, and it succeeds amazingly at that. It is now a mandatory stop for me whenever I'm in Chinatown. One thing to keep in mind though is that they accept cash only."}
{"text":"A little restaurant tucked away in a side street in Chinatown.  What it lacks in size it more than makes up for in taste!   Husband and I popped in for a quick lunch, had some imperial rolls for starters and vegetable Shanghai noodles and Singapore noodles for mains. Food came out in the blink of an eye! The cool thing about this restaurant is that it has an open(ish) kitchen and we were watching in awe as the chef was cooking like a maniac, moving so fast! The food tasted delicious, there were lots of fresh veggies in the vegetable Shanghai noodles and very fresh shrimps in the Singapore noodles. Service was very quick and friendly too.   Couldn't have asked for a better lunch!"}
{"text":"I had the general thao chicken and some fried rice and it was very good"}
{"text":"My husband & I decided it would be fun to do a \"dumpling hop\" in Chinatown, Montréal while here for the F1 Grand Prix. The 3 restaurants we randomly dropped into while walking down Chinatown: Restaurant Noodle Factory, Restaurant Pain Farci, and Qing Hua. We only ordered their juicy pork dumplings at each place.  Restaurant Noodle Factory -  4 stars. The 6 dumplings weren't very juicy but they were tasty and I really enjoyed their sweet dipping sauce. Worth the $10 price tag.   Restaurant Pain Farci -  4 stars. The dumplings here were super soupy, flavorful, and ginormous, hence the $13/$14 price tag for 10 pieces.  Qing Hua =  1 star. The worst dumplings we've ever tasted...unless you like tons of extra hard dough with your dry dumplings. I would caution anyone from going there. Boo! Thumbs down   NOTE: We've been to a few Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore, Japan and southern California so we have something to compare the dumplings to."}
{"text":"Un boui-boui qui ne paye pas de mine mais un vrai délice ! Une petite cantine chinoise où l'on fait la file pour manger un plat typique. C'était très bon et pour un prix très correct.   Je le conseille très fort !"}
{"text":"wasn't bad but wasn't great.  the stir fried handmade noodles would make us come back again and again if we lived in Montreal. the veggie steamed dumplings and wonton noodle soup would not. the steamed dumplings lacked something and it wasn't because it was a veggie and lacked pork or shrimp. we've had great veggie dumplings before and this wasn't the best. the noodles in the wonton soup were good, it was fresh and al dente, as well as the pork wonton which had a very petally wrapper,... but the broth had no flavor of onions, chicken broth, white pepper,... nothing.   below avg or average soup broth requires a dip into the spice tray (chili oil, white pepper, etc...), but a great broth its great on its own. the good thing i didn't have to wait too long to have a second shot at the greatest broth on earth, it just wasn't in the noodle factory."}
{"text":"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #7] A small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with Cantonese noodles.  The restaurant has an open kitchen and serves a variety of stir fry and tasty noodle dishes.  Not a lot of tables so probably not great for a huge group, but a decent sized place to bring your family. Portion size is good for the price.  No credit cards are accepted, but taxes are included in the price.  Highlights: I ordered the beef chow ho fun, which is one of my favorite noodle dishes ($9.95 CAD, tax included).  The dish has beef, green onions, flat rice noodles cut into bite size pieces, and bean sprouts.  This dish tends to be greasy, but I was happy that my order from here was not too greasy.  There was a decent amount of beef.  The server politely served me water, even though I was ordering takeout.  Flavor profile was very good.  Critiques: None really.  Beef rice noodles aren't a fancy dish, so what I ate pretty much met my expectations.  Overall: Noodle Factory satisfied my noodle craving.  The dish I ordered was flavorful, not excessively greasy, and had a decent mix of ingredients that weren't noodles.  Plus, you get good value for the price."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some homemade Chinese food and reasonable prices, come here. However, having tried lots of great Chinese food in so. California, I thought the food was good but spectacular. 1. Soup dumplings-falls apart easily though good flavor. Far from Din Tai Fung 2. Fried onion pancakes-not your usual. A lot more fried dough, less green onions 3. Spicy pork and vegetable noodles- tasty"}
{"text":"Une agréable petite surprise, à un prix qui défie toute compétition!  Nouilles faites maison, service ultra-rapide, balance légume-viande-nouille très acceptable.  Quelques entrées originales et intéressantes (nous avons essayé les beignets à l'échalote, qui étaient parfumés à l'anis, surprenant!).  Portions gargantuesques: Pour deux personnes, un plat de nouille + 1-2 entrées suffisent largement, ce qui fait que vous pouvez bien manger pour moins de 15$ à 2!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place when in chinatown, it's small but cozy, my kids love coming here and look forward to their haircuts since they know it will be followed by a visit to the Noodle Factory, the staff are amazing which everyone that eats in a chinese restaurant are normally used to quiet borderline grumpy workers, but not here, they are the most cheerful people working in a restaurant I've seen.  The fresh handmade noodles are great, broth needs a bit more seasoning, but then again it's better to be able to add salt than to eat something that's too salty to begin with."}
{"text":"Went here for a little dinner before we headed back home from a busy weekend. We (a party of 5) were seated quickly and brought waters, and ordered quickly from an older gentleman. My friend and I ordered the same dish (26, Shanghai noodles with pork), and my other 3 friends all ordered non-noodle based dishes.  Our waiter came over not even 2 minutes after we placed our order with my dish. It wasn't the pictured on the menu, and when I protested he simply set it down and walked away. On further inspection, it wasn't even pork, but chicken. But whatever, I'm not fussy, so I ate it anyways.   Then my friend's dish comes out, and he has the same dish as me, but with beef. He protests, and the waiter that took our order comes over and argues with him. \"I asked for pork,\" My friend says.  \"No, you said beef,\" The waiter says.  \"No, pork. I said 26-B- which is pork on your menu- when I ordered,\" My friend corrects him.  \"B as in beef.\" The waiter says. He takes away my friend's dish anyways, seeming annoyed.  Over the course of the next 3 or 4 minutes, while waiting for my friend's dish to come out, the waiter CONTINUED to come over and berate my friend for his \"mistake\". Eventually my friend's plate comes out this time, and it's an entirely different dish than mine. It's thicker noodles, and has different vegetables in it. It's also chicken, not pork. Our friends who ordered the non-noodle dishes orders all came out fine.  We're pretty through arguing with the rude waiter, so he just eats it. The food was excellent, but the waiter we had was so rude. How do you get 2 of the same dish wrong this badly? We were plenty polite since we all work service ourselves, but arguing with us is a huge no-no. Make sure to have the waiter read your order back to you, and hold them liable if you get the wrong thing. Don't bother trying to get noodles, despite this being their namesake."}
{"text":"Our noodles and dumplings were delicious, and the service was quick and friendly. Unfortunately, that didn't compensate for the fly in the bottom of a bowl of soup, the hair on a dumpling - or the state of the chopsticks and soup spoons, all of which which were coated in a film of grease. In recognition of the food, and the fact that the owner apologized and comped the soup, I'm giving it three stars, but cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Just a small restaurant in China town but really good dishes and great bang for the buck. The only thing to be careful of here is ordering too much!  The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Le personnel est très sympathique et les dimsum sont bons. En revanche, les soupes sont un peu fades à mon goût (c'est bon, mais vraiment rien d'exceptionnel). L'endroit est assez petit donc évitez d'y aller pendant les heures de pointe.   Point positif : Noodle Factory ne ferme pas l'après-midi donc si vous avez une soudaine envie de dimsum ou de nouilles à 16h, cet endroit est fait pour vous.  Point négatif : Ils ne prennent ni la débit, ni la crédit."}
{"text":"pork buns have a slimy flour layer which I dont like ."}
{"text":"Very quick and efficient. Tasty! Definitely expect to have a full glass of water at all times. Bathroom door didn't lock :/"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for some good General Tao later in the evening. I did a quick window shopping tour and then happily found this place which seemed more busy than some at that hour. It has a cool sliding door, which leads to a few steps up to the main door. You have to push this door mightily - there's even a sign that says \"push hard\". Across the top of the open kitchen, where photos of about a dozen dishes. One of them was General Tao for $9.95 (including taxes - cash only). The server was kind enough to seat me and serve a cup of Chinese tea while waiting for my order, which came out steaming hot in a short time. Of course I had to try a piece fresh and almost burnt my lips. I had to blow on it to get it down safely. Had excellent taste and spice. Forgot to ask for no MSG, but didn't seem to be much if any? Only downside was (fairly common with this dish) a few overly chewy bits that you have to put aside."}
{"text":"Incredible taste, super fast, and a good bargain to boot. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants I've ever been to, would come back again in a heartbeat. Great place!"}
{"text":"Above average Asian noodles & food.  Noodles are a bit different from what I am used to.  The Spicy Pork with Noodles consists of thin noodles, a dark sauce made of minced pork and a handful of julienned cucumbers.  Looks can be deceiving as the cucumbers look fresh and cold and the dark sauce look very salty.  Surprise!!!  You mix it up and when you eat it, it tastes like the Chinese adaptation of a hardy American spaghetti with thick meat sauce.  The bowl serving is large and you get tons of food for your $$$.  Other items such as the dim sum and flat noodles are made fresh and decent tasting.  The owner was polite and the dining area clean.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very good price for quantity, my table ordered #21 hand pulled pork and veggie noodles and it was 8.50$ after tax!   However, the noodles were overcooked and soggy which took a way a lot of the quality. Furthermore, it wasn't so much a bowl of noodles or ramen like I was expecting, but more like a dish with lots of veggies and pork with some broth poured in as an afterthought.   It definitely had a more Chinese food vibe/taste than I would've liked, as opposed to other noodle places (like pho or Lan zhou noodles), and was kind of sloppy overall.  The service was great though! Very nice man who was waiting on us, attentive with water and tea.   The place is pretty small, the biggest tables seat four and there's maybe space for twenty people total in there.  I did only try the number 21 noodles so it's possible the rest of the menu was better."}
{"text":"Gotta say that I love Chinese (who doesn't?) went with my friends about a year ago and found it super yummy.   I did find a hair in my noodles right away- and the staff dealt with it immediately and gave me a different plate. Would recommend as it's inexpensive and pretty tasty too with a good staff :).  Food for thought- they didn't take cards (gotta pay up cash) not sure if the situation has changed since."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills Asian noodle (and rice) restaurant, but I'm a fan. First, I'm impressed with the service. I've only been for take out, but was treated very well. They let you sit at a table by the counter while you peruse the menu. The first time I was given a glass of water while I waited, and the second time (when it was very cold out) I was given free hot tea, including a refill when I gratefully finished my first cup! The food comes out within a few minutes.  And the food is good. I've had a couple starters and two noodle dishes. The crispy spring onion pancakes (#5) were delicious! There are two in an order and I tried saving the second for my lunch the next day, but I couldn't; I had to tear into it right away. The noodle dishes were good, but not great. I liked the Cantonese chow mein a bit more than the Shanghai style noodles. Both could have used some hot sauce, which I have to remember to ask for next time. For $8-$10 the noodle dishes are BIG and could serve for two meals (which I did) or for sharing.  The menu is light on description, but has lots of pictures, which I find to be helpful in this case. There are a few tables in here for those wishing to dine in.  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"For the price and service this place deserves 5 stars. I came in by myself for an early dinner. I was seated quickly and had my order of handmade noodles with vegetables in front of me in a about 5 min. The service was friendly and everyone spoke English and French very well. The meal was fairly large and very filling. I couldn't finish it all. The noodles and vegetables were delicious in a light soya sauce. My bill came to just under 10 bucks. It's the perfect place to go to if you are eating on your own or just want a quick, no fuss meal."}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service! Our food came out in less than 10 minutes despite the restaurant being somewhat busy. Lots of vegetarian options!!! The menu has accurate pictures of the food so you can see what you're ordering. I got the shanghai noodles and they were perfect. Will definitely be coming back! Cash only though so come prepared."}
{"text":"Nous avons commandé des dumplings et 2 plats de nouilles qui était selon le serveur les spécialités du restaurant. C'était ordinaire.  Pour les nouilles faites à la main il vaut mieux aller chez Nudo ou au Langzhou noodles sur St-laurent."}
{"text":"Very good price and what adds to the dining experience is the fact that there's (almost always) someone who makes noodle in front of you so you know that they actually hand make their noodle, which is chewy and tasty in general. I always order the same noodle with meat sauce because it's my fav, the other dishes I ordered were really so-so."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at the Noodle Factory and this experience was no different than my first, the variety, quality, flavors, consistency and authenticity are all there, plus the waiter/owner was extraordinarily gracious and quite helpful pointing out the nuances of their menu. There are a number of fresh Asian greens that can be ordered as well to accompany your meal but the stars of the show are the hand pulled noodles or the Shanghai noodles served dry with vegetables or souped if you prefer. Whatever you like, you will like the Noodle Factory and this little resto deserves a place near the top of your list when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"When the waiters treat you with disdain, the tables a little sticky, and the shouting in the kitchen are at an appropriate shouting decibel, you know you have found a legitimate Chinese restaurant. Great food.  Totally hit the spot.  Crazy to say, but one of the best meals we had in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was at a technical show at the Palais de Congres in Montreal (first visit here!), and looking at a map I saw how close I was to Chinatown!  I picked noodle factory and was not disappointed.  My only regret is that I was there by myself so I couldn't order lots of different things to try out as I would have if I was with a larger group.    As it was a cooler day, I ended up going with the zha jiang mian and it was great!  Savory, noodles cooked perfectly, and just the right ratio of sauce:noodles.  I'm thinking about going back another time for the dumplings!  Cash only, but there is a bank/atm just next door."}
{"text":"Boring... easy to order but it just didnt have the taste I was expecting.   You fill out a form on what you want and they cook it to order... noodles and tofu were overcooked and veggies were undercooked... asked for peanut sauce and got soy sauce..?   Atleast they were super nice and helpful, gave us the tools we needed for to-go  Food 4/10 Staff 9/10 Price should have been cheaper for the quality ($30) Pizzaz 2.2/10 aka no"}
{"text":"I rated 3 stars but, I actually like it for a 3.5 stars, very nice cozy place just above the metro station Place D'arm. My friend and I were on a budget that weekend didn't want to spend 30$ on a half decent meal at the Old Port so we went to try a new taste in near by Chinatown. Came by this tiny business ordered a noodle soup very flavorful and filling. The waiter was funny kinda rude at first but warmed up to us as we stayed. Not very clean had a dirty cup and fork but was replaced. Gave me a free coke . My friend did not enjoy the food as much but we was satisfied overall."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars cus everything was perfect ! Best chinese diner probably ever had ! Was so freshh taste was really good ! Service was excellent! My girlfriend like the penut sauce so much she scooped up some on her fork and ate whole dab of it lolllll  Spring rolls were amazing ! Noodles were awesome !! General tao best ever wasnt too sweet and had that exact amout!   Ill return 100% amazing wow !!! So clean so fresh great everyrhing !!!"}
{"text":"The Hanan dumplings (peanut butter and chili oil) were . We def recommend that. We also got the wonton noodle soup which was too bland. The soup had no flavor and almost tasted like water. The place is cash Only, but accepts USD and they will give you 10% discount on the bill if you pay USD for the exchange rate. Better exchange rate than what you'd get at foreign exchange rate stores!"}
{"text":"Had the hand made noodles with vegetable and my friend ordered them with beef. Noodles were good, everything came out quickly. Efficient service. Both items were $10. My only wish is that more vegetables were in the dish, it has a couple pieces broccoli, carrots & bok choy. More broccoli would have been good. The beef I didn't care for, it had a weird super cheap beef flavor/texture. Not my thing. Otherwise was pretty good & I'd try again but get some different items"}
{"text":"What a weird experience! Don't get me wrong. The food was fantastic! However the elderly man that was operating the front of house was incredibly rude. It was a strange experience because he was nice to other people who appeared to be repeat customers, but perhaps because I was a new customer  or perhaps because clearly I only speak  English  he definitely took a dislike to me. Anyway the food was very good and worth putting up with the old man's grimacing and crappy attitude."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but if you're in the mood for Chinese this place will definitely satisfy your craving. Really good general tao chicken but shanghai noodles were too wet. Small store, friendly enough employees."}
{"text":"Great Chinese joint near downtown Montreal. Very nice and helpful staff. The food got to the table fast and hot. Really good Shanghai noodles!"}
{"text":"I can see why the owner was all smiles. This place is a money making machine! 15-20 minute wait for a table. Fresh noodles and dumplings. All very tasty! Open kitchen. Like my friend pointed out, this is no Top Chef but it definitely hits the spot when you're craving dumplings!"}
{"text":"First off, our service was lightning quick.  We ordered and our food was out in like 5 minutes!  We had the Singapore noodles, the handmade noodles with pork, and pork and shrimp dumplings.  The portions were large and flavors were well balanced.  The red sauce they provide is spicy and accents the flavors in the dishes nicely.  Don't forget to grab a spoonful!  The service was friendly and efficient too."}
{"text":"This place definitely disappointed.  Noodles are not hand made any longer - while portions were large the food could have been from any mall food court.  The soup dumplings were ok - not much broth.  The vegetarian dumplings had a tasty filling but the wrappers were a bit glutinous.  The servers were a bit rude - making comments then laughing when they left the table.  Overall I would skip this place.  There must be better noodle shops in the city."}
{"text":"Its fast, i like the singapour dishe, few crowded tables, seems popular spot. But nothing expectacular for me."}
{"text":"Oodles of noodles for everyone other than Asians. Their noodles are cooked to perfection, however the accommodating sides or meat atop is what provides the flavor- either from the sauce or meat itself.   If you like Panda Express from the states, you'll love this place."}
