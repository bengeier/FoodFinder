{"text":"(Restaurant, not bar/dancing) Maybe the only place in Toronto for West African fare -- Senegalese, though I'm not schooled enough to know the difference. Food was good, but not amazing. Menu choices were limited. Good selection of unusual fruit drinks. Decor is nice, but the big TV is distracting. Place was pretty empty on a Thursday evening. Relaxed service typical of African restaurant. A bit pricey, but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Here's how I justify my four-star rating:

The sound system is good, better than many places in the Kensington Market area, what with the common problem of clubs limiting the low-end because neighbors live cheek-to-jowl. Add to this the fact that the cover at this club is usually moderately low and nearby clubs often cost twice as much for the same beer and comparable musical selection. Friendly staff and the intimate size of the space make this an enjoyable place to see a show with a group of friends. It's around average space-wise. Personally speaking, the rare-groove soul and funk selections regularly on offer make this place a stand-out. 

Btw: I had no idea they had West African food, this can only be a plus."}
{"text":"From all accounts, Teranga is a small bar. It has a low stage so I can imagine seeing a band in a packed room would be frustrating. It's narrow but I wouldn't say tiny; to give you a gauge, it's about the size of the Rivoli downstairs, though a few feet smaller. I will admit that my last two visits here, both for dance parties, the bar wasn't packed and we had plenty of space to move around. 

Drinks are reasonably priced. It's about $5.50 for a mixed drink. Their best deal is that you can get a small pitcher of your favourite mixed drink for $12.50, which amounts to three drinks and you save a few dollars. Those are sweet, sweet words to a Yelper's ear.

I don't know why but Teranga has grown on me a bit. I guess this has to do with the fact that the walls are decorated with wooden masks and artwork from a culture I admire so much. 

It's not a fancy place but the atmosphere is so relaxed and inviting, and that makes a huge difference for me and where I want to hang out. 

I also enjoyed chatting with the bartender and the co-owner, who genuinely enjoyed having us there and treated us well. This attitude was reflective in his actions when he joined us on the dancefloor for a few songs.  

Another reason to visit Teranga again is the restaurant. It has been undergoing renovations all summer and is scheduled to re-open in the fall. It might be a good place for me to try West African food in the city as there's so few places to try in the city. 

Overall, I'll give 3.5 stars for now until I try the food."}
{"text":"Terenga is this tiny little bar across the street from the Boat that kinda came out of nowhere. All of a sudden, about a year or two ago, people starting having shows there and dance parties and Terenga was the place to be.

I guess it's an OK place to be. It's TINY and narrow and usually filled to the brim, so as long as you're comfortable with other people's sweat, you'll be fine. Staff are friendly, booze is average price, atmosphere is decent.

Washrooms are godawful. I remember one time that both toilets in the women's washroom were clogged and there was a lineup out the door. Seriously?!?! How did that even happen? Why didn't somebody get a plunger and solve this immediately? GROSS.

They do have a decent amount of small, fun shows here where you're basically right in front of whoever's playing; they call that \"intimate\" which can be good or bad depending on the band. The same \"intimacy\" goes for the dance floor, which is more often bad. Basically it depends on the night -- I've never had an awful time here, and when it was bad, it was just because of the washrooms. If there's something fun going on, definitely check out Terenga.

And tooootally not wheelchair accessible -- you have to go up a steep flight of stairs to get in. Also I had no idea they served food here."}
