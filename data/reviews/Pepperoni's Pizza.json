{"text":"Convenient to our home. Pretty good pizza for the price. We ordered a large pizza w/3 toppings, 8 wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda for $22. Wings are good. They have been open for a year and are just starting to sell soft serve ice cream. They do have novelty ice cream in a case. I see a lot of potential here. I'll go back and try their subs and calzones"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant today for the first time. It is not your typical family restaurant, it's part of a convenience store. It is separated from the store under the same roof. We ordered their special, a XL, 3 topping pizza with 8 wings and a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi for $22.99. The wings were delicious. When the pizza arrived (thin crust), I was surprised how yummy it looked. The restaurant is owned by at least 2 women that run the business. They were very friendly and attentive. The pizza tasted very good. I'm from Chicago and know what a good pizza taste like. Everything is served with styrofoam plates and cups with plastic silverware. It would be more appealing if they used real plates, plastic or glass glasses with real silverware. I definitely will eat there many more times."}
{"text":"We order takeout from Pepperoni's about once a week. The food is great! The pizza, calzones, stromboli, meatball sub, and wings are fantastic. We have a hard time choosing what to eat because it's all so good. The only food we haven't enjoyed are the salads; they are mostly just a giant chunk of iceberg lettuce. The service is generally excellent; only rarely do we have to wait longer than anticipated for our food. Once they finish renovating (and add more seating), this will be a five-star establishment!"}
