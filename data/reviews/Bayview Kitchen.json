{"text":"Excellent set dinner menus. Dishes are delicious and comes with soup and dessert. All at a reasonable price. Would eat in everyday if there weren't so many people at night"}
{"text":"Legitimately one of my favourite Chinese restaurants to go to. It's super cheap for lunch and they give you a drink as well as soup.  Cheap good Chinese food. Can't get any better than that"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for dinner takeout. Food was delicious and wok style. I also love the soup and desserts that come with the combo."}
{"text":"The store was rather small, plain and packed with people so my friends and I ordered takeout.  People had to share tables to make room.  We ordered set for 4 and it was pretty cheap with huge portions.  It was around $20 and easily fed all of us (4 people)  with leftovers.  The food was good but I didn't like the soup.  My friends seemed to like it though.  Overall its a great place to get a cheap meal but its pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Great quality food! Small space which can suck if you do not have a reservation Last few times I've been here it's been good but sometimes the service is not up to par which is why I am only giving 3 stars Good if craving a Chinese food night!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast/early lunch.  Beef brisket with wonton soup (get the flat rice noodles/ho fun instead of the thin vermicelli it comes with) is the best item (scoop some chili oil in there too), and it comes with a drink. This is pretty much the only thing I go there for since there are better options in the area if you're looking to order more typical Cantonese-style foods."}
{"text":"This place is a basic, no frills home-cooked chinese food restaurant. It's not too big of a restaurant so if it's busy they might ask you to share a table with another group.  My family and I come here when my parents are too lazy to cook and we usually get the set meal for 4 people. Food is good here, pretty yummy and not very msg-y (though I'm really bad at discerning that). We usually get the beef with green onions and some sort of seafood veggie medley. I think the set meals come with soup and Chinese dessert also.   And Erwin M. is right, it IS called Bayview Kitchen"}
{"text":"I love Bayview Kitchen. Been going there with my family for 10+ years now for breakfast, dinner, and everything in between. Their decor recently had a facelift which was a nice addition. I come back time and time again for their friendly service, dependable quality food, and very reasonable price points."}
{"text":"I think this place must have gained all their hype prior to Richmond Hill getting any good chinese food. Most of their food ranges from mediocre to just below average. You know their fried rice is sad even just from looking at it. It's also overpriced compared to similar restaurants nearby. The service is never anything special and if it gets busy you'll get forgotten if you're a small group.  This place used to be an okay spot for semi-authentic chinese food cravings, but now that there's better options it's not worth going to anymore."}
{"text":"Three words: LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Ordered the eggplant noodles and ground beef spaghtti baked with cheese. Both are fantastic! If it wasnt so far from my home, i would go there everyday! Aweeeeesssooommmeeeeee!   Oh one thing i dont like  about that place is the milk tea but the food is deinitely worth ever penny because it is cheap too!"}
{"text":"Good food. Cheap.  Small little place Only takes cash.  It feels like the last good hole in the wall Chinese restaurant left.  The people here are really friendly.  Its always packed because it only has 6 tables.  I'd eat here over MacDonald's any day.  Oh ya, they also give you a free soup for dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices and very friendly service. The place is small thou so expect to wait a bit during peak lunch/dinner time"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick and very cheap lunch this is the place to go. It is a small restaurant so come early for lunch if you want a seat especially on weekdays as it is very popular with students. Lunch menu is served with a milk tea and has a pretty good selection for such a small place.   I would love to recommend that you come here again but then I'd be out of a seat =P"}
{"text":"This place has opened for at least more than 10 years and their food has become better each year. My family and I would go for dinner here 2-3 times a week back then. Their dinner dishes are delicious, especially their dinner set which serve with their soup of the day and dessert are literally so good. Although it is a small place but it is tidy and clean, services are great!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a little gem tucked away in a tiny plaza (right beside the massive Restoran Malaysia). Bayview Kitchen serves up good home style Chinese cooking. Their food is consistent and have not yet disappointed me.  I love their honey garlic and black pepper chicken wings that come in a hot sizzling pot. Could be one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"First of all this place is called \"Bayview Kitchen\". I know this for a fact because I'm holding their take-out flyer as I write this. Second, this is one of those places that you frequent only if you live nearby. I can't imagine anyone making an effort to drive a distance just for this particular Chinese take-out.  Since I do live around the area, and I tend to have cravings for fried rice, sweet and sour pork,  and the like, I have to A-OK this place at the very least. There's a dine-in area which has around 10 tables but I only go for pick-up where there's an automatic 10% discount. Fried Rice with another dish at around 15$ which can actually feed 3-4 people, I'd say it's pretty worth it. Food is not bad either.  Note: Cash only."}
{"text":"Small Chinese diner that serves a variety of Chinese food from soup noodles to rice and fried noodles.  The food here is very good and portion is huge.  Lunch special range from $7.50 for rice dishes to over $10.  Lunch combo gets you soup, main and hot drink. Cold drink is extra $0.75 like all places. They have like 3 table round table and they expect you to share those tables with strangers when it gets busy.  Been here twice and was always good.   Would came here more often if it was always jam packed."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday and ordered some fried rice and chicken chow mein, and it was delicious. The prices are pretty good and the portions are quite substantial. My only issue was that the servers seem so grumpy all of the time. I don't think a single person that worked there smiled at me once. I'll go here again for the food though."}
{"text":"Been here so many times, with parents and friends. Food is awesome, staff is friendly, prices are good."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews thinking this place was good. I'm guessing it's because people can't really tell the difference in the quality of the ingredients. The prices aren't that cheap either. The taste is okay but didn't enjoy the seating there.   Would only recommend if you are in a rush for a quick and cheap meal."}
{"text":"This review is for their dinner menu. I'm not a fan of their breakfast items and would give that 2 stars. This place is the best to go for a cheap, super quick and fulfilling dinner. Their items are always sizzling hot and very flavourful. You can tell that their food is cooked using a really hot wok to maximize on flavour.  I also enjoy their desserts, which isn't diluted with water then thickened back up with corn starch. Service is very quick and you're really in and out of there so it's great if you're in a rush and want something yummy."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for years now, for both lunch and dinner, and even a couple times for breakfast. Overall, the food is good, price is cheap, large portions and has great variety.  Breakfast menu is usually some toast sandwich with coffee/tea and fairly cheap.  Lunch menu is rice with some dish or fried rice/noodle (and a couple other things). It comes with a choice of 2 different soups (I always get the corn and egg drop one) and a choice of drink (hot/cold milk tea, lemon tea, soy drink).  Dinner is usually individual orders of various dishes with rice on the side (extra) and there are some pre-set combos with varying degrees of discount. Dinner comes with a soup (usually pork bone, large bowl to share if eating with multiple people), and some sweet dessert at the end.  Like many others have said, they only have 5-6 tables so coming at peak meal times would result in long waits, but they also have take-outs available. Also they only accept cash.  The staff are very nice and there have never been any significant delays in getting the food served. I have been going there for years and will continue to do so as I have never been disappointed thus far. There is a TV in the restaurant, and it is usually tuned to the Chinese news channel.  On the side, their menu contains mostly Chinese food items but there are a few western style items. My suggestion would be, since it is a Chinese restaurant, order the Chinese style items, lest you be disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time back in high school. I think it deserved a 4 star rating back then. Presently, I would say this review is more of a 3.5 stars. Thank goodness the quality of the baked minced beef with egg on rice hasn't changed (some of my friends have visited recently and their fave dishes have a completely different flavor profile). Sometimes it's a little too peppery which is disappointing but aside from that, it's fairly consistent. They always give ample sauce on the rice. The baked portuguese sauce dishes are also not bad at all and surprisingly the cheesy meat sauce spaghetti is really good. One thing that is terrible here is the milk tea though haha. It's rancid. Idk who makes their milk tea but they need to watch youtube or just let someone else make it. My friends and I came all the time in high school and the ladies were so nice to us back then and some of them still remember us when we drop in from time to time."}
{"text":"Great place... the focus is on the food so don't expect great decor.  The staple Cantonese dishes are very well executed and you can taste the \"wok hey\".  We like the seafood chow mein... nice and crispy noodles... lemon chicken while not traditional was also wonderful.  If you want to eat there get there early or you will be in for wait."}
{"text":"This is a tiny hole in the wall hong kong cafe style restaurant. Not many seats. But quick turnover.  Ladies working here were extremely pleasant and very smiley and apparently have been here forever.  They have lunch specials that are super cheap ($5-8) but other times are also cheap.  Food itself was pretty good, tried bites of their tomato sauce pork chop, black pepper beef, curry beef and egg drop soup.  They only take cash here."}
{"text":"Food is still very good here. The service is still pretty good. The things that they should look at is the hot sauce that they gave us. It's watery and little. The small bottle of salt and pepper runs out very quickly. Otherwise not bad at all."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant! I've been coming here for 10-15 years now and they honestly never disappoint.   Service is great, and they are quick and accommodating. No matter how busy they are, the waitresses are always smiling and polite, which I feel like is really rare for HK cafes!   Food wise, flavours are great and homey. Their Baked Minced Beef with Egg on Rice is super hearty and to die for. I have yet to find anywhere that compares! I also really like their Ma Po Tofu rice. Such a good combination of flavour and spice and so saucy. For dishes, I'd recommend trying the Taro and Chicken in Coconut Cream and the Sweet and Sour Pork!   Although they have gone up a little in price in the recent years, the meal is always filling. Still average priced compared to other places in the area though. Lunch comes with a drink and soup, and dinner comes with soup and dessert. Breakfast and afternoon tea comes with the drink only.  The only two downsides about this place is that their milk tea is slightly lacking, and that the place is small. Be expected to wait for a table, but trust me, it will be well worth your wait!"}
{"text":"Bayview Kitchen is a great value play at Major Mac/Bayview.  They're your standard HK-style cafe with noodle and rice dishes.  Lunch specials are usually in the $6-7 range and comes with coffee/tea.  Portions are very generous with lots of carbs (i.e., rice/noodle) and a decent amount of meat.  Most dishes are generally tasty.  Service, decor and plating are all very basic.  Nothing fancy, but a good place for quick, cheap, carbo-licious HK-cafe food!"}
{"text":"Hello, Yelp. I've missed you. I know it's only been a few days, but it's nice to be writing again, especially cuz I know I've got a few backlogged reviews.   Bayview Kitchen has been around quite a while. While this is not my first time eating here, It's been quite a while since I've come. This time, we ordered takeout for Grandma's house.  Their seafood fried rice looks very plain. Rice base wasn't very tasty. Not much seafood. If you like plain rice, this is good for you. Portion was fairly large though.  Their beef and veggie hor fun was also generous in portion. There wasn't enough wok heat to char the hor fun the way I like it. Not smokey enough. The veggies were fresh. I can't comment on the beef, because Chinese sliced beef (and most pork) makes me sad. It's not meat textured or meat flavored, but is supposedly meat. While this is culturally accepted, I am not a fan of the flavor or the texture, so I'd rather just not eat it.   Their red braised tofu (forgive my poor attempt at translating. Probably more of a braised tofu and veggie esque thing on their menu) was more veggie than tofu, which was fairly disappointing. I expect random veggies to buff up the portions in Chinese dishes, but the fewer there are, the more pleased I will be. If it's more filler veg than the main item I wanted, it'd be lovely if the menu item read \"filler veg with tofu\" instead of tofu with (filler) veg. End of rant. I have to say, though, that one of the filler veg items was baby corn, and it was the giant version of baby corn. Sort of an oxymoron here, but baby corn is usually fairly skinny, and has tiny little kernels. This was more like mini corn on the cob, except that you could eat the cob part too.   I'll probably be back for convenience's sake, but I won't be ordering these three dishes again."}
{"text":"their food is alright. prices are relatively cheap and they are pretty generous with their portions. i don't know they just taste like your standard chinese food so don't rly know how to say. i like the soup they give you LOL (im positive it has msg but whatever tastes okay to me)   i went here one rainy school day with my mom like back in October 2015. we were seated next to this lady and her niece. see, i hate sitting next to someone so close. just rly makes me uncomfortable and half the time i find myself eavesdropping into their conversation LOL (the lady burped which made me wanna hurl. doesn't help she was so close and i can smell it nsjsososj)   umm.. so yeah it's usually rly packed and there isn't a whole lot of space to kind of walk and stand around. Opting for takeout would be ideal if you don't wanna deal with such things"}
{"text":"Best sweet and sour pork in the city! A must try. It's a quick, cheap, but very authentic Chinese meal. The staff are always super friendly. I go here at least once or twice a month. Quality is always consistent as well. The place is very small and a little grungy, so you may need to wait during busy dinner rush hours."}
{"text":"Friendly people always helps to raise the number of stars I'm willing to give, and the ladies at Bayview Kitchen are delightful and friendly as they come! Note that they only take cash and there are not convenient ATMs nearby.  The food is pretty good for take out Chinese and resonably priced, I feel. My biggest complaint with take out food is flavour and seasoning and they pass on both counts. I have taken out food before that looks great and tastes like nothing, not at problem at Bayview court. They asked me if I wanted napkins, chopsticks, plastic cutlery, hot sauce, etc, and were happy to supply what I needed.  The beef and onion was flavourful and the beef was tender (or tenderized) and easy to eat. Too many places use tough beef, not Bayview court. Many place also try to skimp on the proteins, but not here I feel that the portions were fair and even pleantiful.  My wife really liked their lemon chicken, she's happens to be a lemon chicken connoisseur, so order it if you like that type of dish.  I ordered the dinner for four plus an extra order of baby bok choy, and I feel it was priced just right and deliver a lot of food, enough for a few meals! It came with a bunch of spring rolls, a lightly fried rice, seafood noodle, four soups (I choose 2 hot'n'sour and 2 wonton), then you get to pick two mains and I choose beef, onion and mushrooms and the lemon chicken.  Everything else was good and I will be going back again."}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant with less than 10 tables.  If you are looking for a cheap lunch with good food, this is the place to be.  For $7.50, you will get a bowl of daily soup(see photo), a meal that you ordered(see photo) and a drink.  We went there this morning to have an early lunch. Ordered Baked Pork Chop and rice with Tomato Sauce; and Rice and Beef with Honey  Pepper Sauce.  They were both very tasty and didn't feel thirsty afterward(No MSG, I guess).  I would give it a 5 stars rating if not because of the rusty floor and old washroom.  The tables; wall and fixtures looks new(renovated?)."}
{"text":"I bet no Brazil fans wanted to cook or even eat after the heartbreaking game!  What a good excuse to get take-out.  Passed by here and pulled in. It is a small restaurant and it was kind of quiet.  Ordered sweet and sour pork and a half soy sauce chicken.  The food were ready in 10 min!  They used aluminium containers and the food were still hot when I reached home.  The sweet and sour pork was a bit soggy after it had been covered in the container for 20 min. Taste good tho!  Guess it would be better if dine in.  Chicken didn't have enough flavor.  Will go eat in sometimes and try sweet and sour pork again.  No mood in eating today actually : ( * 10% on pick up order * ^^ complimentary dessert even for take out **"}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch special fried rice ($7).  It was rather salty, oily, and delicious, assuming you like sodium.  My dining partner ordered a baked rice with pork chops ($6).  The rice was a bit dry, so thank god for the tomato sauce that was artificially reddish in color.  The portion was not big, just enough for a single person servicing, but it came with a Hong Kong style milk tea or coffee.    The services was efficient but not the most smiley.  But I don't expect that at a low cost venue.  Parking is difficult."}
{"text":"Pros: Plenty of lunch specials to choose from Prices are alright  Cons: Portions are on the small side Place is small  Had to come up to the Carter's near here to pick up a Jacket for my little one and decided to stop here for lunch.  Bayview Kitchen is your typical HK style cafe.  It doesn't do anything to stand out from the rest but it doesn't do anything horrible to make you not want to come back either.  Walking in, you notice right away this place is small.  There's 3 round tables, 3 tables for 4 and a single table at the front for 2.  When we came in, there were 2 tables being seated.  Within 10 minutes though, the place was full and people had to wait.  I would not recommend coming during peak times as you most certainly have to wait.  If you're someone who doesn't like to share tables with other people, it's even worse.  Still, turnover time for a place like this is usually quick so that helps.  For lunch, Bayview Kitchen offers a lot of lunch specials ranging from $5 to about $12-13.  Each special comes with a drink and soup.  We weren't given any other menu so I assume that  if you want something other than the lunch specials, you might be out of luck.  I ordered the fried udon noodle with beef and my GF had the Chicken with eggplant on rice.  As with most HK style cafes, food comes out relatively quickly after you order.  I don't have anything to really say about the food, it tastes as it should.  I just want to make note that the portions are smaller than I'm used to.  Looking at my pics, the plate my udon came in was rather small.  I glanced over at another table who ordered the baked rice and the dish they serve it in is smaller as well.  If you order the rice specials as my GF did, you get a much bigger plate used. That's your best bet for bang for the buck here.  All in all, Bayview Kitchen is a decent place to get your HK style cafe fix.  I could see myself coming back if I'm in the area but it's not something I would go out of my way to come to."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bayview Kitchen since high school and the food has always been great. This small HK style cafe can get very busy on weekends at lunch as it is tiny, you can often find yourself sharing a large table with strangers.  My favourite dish is the minced meat on rice with a raw egg on top.  Over the years, the price of all items on the menu have increased dramatically and I find myself coming here less and less. Similar food and portions can be found elsewhere where you can be seated more comfortably.  Overall, with all the competition out there, this place no longer stands out to me; the furniture is coming apart (the tabletops are peeling) and it is quite dirty."}
{"text":"No Nonsense quick food!  Food is very good, and the price can't be beat in the area.  Lunch specials are fantastic.  A little cramped and the place is busy.  I like to do takeout to avoid the busy times.  2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Been here so many times but I can't even pretend to like it anymore. Each time I get something, I am let down.  I usually get the lunch specials because for the price, what you get is definitely cheaper than other restaurants in the area. You get a large portion of food, a soup, and drink.  Ive tried several items such as the satay beef on rice and today I decided to try something new (had no idea what it was): mayalsian style rice noodles with pork and shrimp.  The rice dish: tons of rice, small portion of meal and other. It's very plain. Meat and some onions in sauce.  The noodles: very plain as well and extremely oily. Way too oily, I found it hard to eat and I didn't finish it. After getting this dish, I found out Malaysian style noodles are like a dry curry noodle. I like sauce so I was quite disappointed with trying something unknown.  This place is extremely popular. It's known to everyone in Richmond Hill, I'd like to think (I'm a native here). I can't even say that this food is okay. The menu is pretty extensive so each time I come I can try something new in hopes that it can redeem this place, but so far nothing is great. I would not recommend this place at all.  If anything, the milk is is pretty decent. Has a weird after taste/feeling in my mouth but is not the worst."}
{"text":"If you want poorly made Chinese food with bad service then Bayview Kitchen is your place. Took me 5 minutes to find a parking spot on a busy plaza. The waiter looked like she just returned from the funerals. The rice was not cooked properly, and the meat was dry and rubbery - no amount of sauce could help it. The positives? I liked the decor and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant with my parents. We ordered half a deep fried chicken, seafood fried rice and stir fried rice noodles with beef. The deep fried chicken was pretty good - kind of like peling duck, but chicken, it was served with pringles which was kind of odd. The fried rice was bland and a bit wet compared to normal white rice. The stir fried noodles were really good, drenched in sauce with beef and a few stems of chinese broccoli.  You also get free chicken and corn broth as well as sweet porridge-y dessert.   It's a very small restaurant - as in theres 6 to 8 tables. They encourage takeout and you get 10% off your bill if you do."}
{"text":"Bayview Kitchen is a good choice if you want something cheap, quick and fast.   Afternoon tea from 2pm to 5 pm..great for late lunches! My $4.25 Beef Brisket/Wonton Noodles with tea was perfect!   Quick, fast and friendly services!   Closed on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick eat here, considering that I came here on a whim.  Also, I had French Toast and HK Milk Tea. Toast was alright, but the milk tea seemed to taste a bit diluted."}
{"text":"Went to Bayview Kitchen for a quick dinner. I've always been curious about this place because it's always packed when I pass by it on my way to eat at Restoran Malaysia. They must be doing something right.  I ordered a club sandwich, a double decker sandwich with lettuce, tomato, ham, egg, and chicken salad. Although you can't really go wrong with a club sandwich, this one pales compared to other ones that I've eaten at other hk-style cafes. The flavours were rather bland.  My boyfriend ordered a satay beef fried noodle. We couldn't taste any satay at all. The whole dish just looked like it was slapped together without much care. I know I shouldn't complain for such cheap prices, but I've had much better food with the same price point at other Chinese cafes.   So my questino is, why is this place so popular? Maybe it's due to the lack of choices around this area, but I wouldn't go back for dinner."}
