{"text":"This was a great experience. The place was very clean and homey. I liked that the tables weren't all the same, each had a different style. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and they were very patient taking our order. The prices are extremely fair, especially compared to bigger places, like Bob Evans. We waited a very short time for 4 breakfast plates, not the 30+ minutes that's the usual elsewhere and the food was fantastic. Everything was tasty and perfectly cooked. This will definitely be our go to place. They serve breakfast all day and have a great selection for any meal you'd like."}
{"text":"Grand opening was today.  Service was pretty good and  people were nice.  The hours were not posted clearly out front so we didn't realize they were closing in 10 minutes.  The food was ok but does need some work.  The veggie wrap was mostly lettuce and onions and the fries were a little under cooked.  I think once the crew settles in and gets used to the menu it could be pretty good.  There are a lot of good options the menu."}
{"text":"Cashier not only changed my order for me at the register, but up-charged me $2 for a side of sausage that ended up being literally one patty, and then they only included two strips of bacon with the meal. I never complain but I felt like I shouldn't have been up-charged for the \"extra side\" of meat at the very least, considering there was barely any on my plate... But when I mentioned something about it to her, she acknowledged yet did absolutely nothing to correct the issue. Left in silence feeling overcharged and underfed, and with all the quality breakfast houses in the area I likely will not be returning to this one - one star."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got an omelette with hash browns and toast and it was yummy. I loved being able to get my own coffee, since the coffee was great and i love the variety of mugs. It was pretty busy when we went but the wait wasn't very long, considering there were five of us. Very affordable for college students too! I will come again :)"}
{"text":"Great home style food. Very relaxing atmosphere to have their wonderful coffee. I usually get their breakfast. Love the pancakes!! Definitely recommend to anyone!!"}
