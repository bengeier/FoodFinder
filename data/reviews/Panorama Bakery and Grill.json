{"text":"The food is really great and the place is clean. Good for kids and there are booths on each side of the floor. Rice is not easy to do well so they know what they are doing when they get the rice perfect. No evidence of the issues expressed in previous reviews."}
{"text":"Owner of this place actually used to work at paramount i was told, interesting. I got a bbq chicken from here. It was ok, a bit too dry. Garlic sauce was nice. Manakeesh here are comparable to this of paramounts. I am yet to try their shawarma, however will do so soon."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place, NOT ANYMORE! The restaurant is dirty! Service is now horrible and the flood is not the level of quality I was used to. If you want good middle eastern food go either to cleopatra across the street or acacia fine foods. Sad because this place used to be soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Fresh pitas made in their place. Large portions and tasty.  The provided veggies were fresh and crisp as well."}
{"text":"3.5*

The smaller, cheaper, ma 'n pa version of Paramount.  And if that + having the same, fresh, puffed pitas isn't enough of a comparison, Panorama - also starting with a 'P' - is located just up the street!

(I read somewhere that the ex-manager of Paramount owns Panorama, but I cannot confirm this.  What I do know is that the concept is the same, minus the contemporary d√©cor, hustle 'n bustle, uniformed waitstaff, and baklava.  Minus a *.)

The \"Bakery\" in the title is somewhat misleading 'cause aside from the pitas/manakeesh (\"pizzas\"), there aren't any other baked goods.  Didn't see any baklava 'round.  :(

The Good:  Serving sizes are LARGER than Paramount.  Their Shish Tawouk (chicken kebab) chunks much bigger than those offered at Paramount.  Another bonus is that their prices are lower, eg. Paramount Chicken Shawarma Sandwich - $6.49 (+tax), Panorama - $4.99.

The Bad:  Not all waitstaff are fluent in English.  I asked what kinda drinks they had, i.e. non-pop, and the waitress suggested some \"ginger drink\" that she's never tried before.  I was expecting something different, exotic, but was brought Schweppes.  My friend asked for a mango drink and was brought an orange juice.

Their servers were also wearing street clothes which was off-putting.  Even though it's a casual/family atmosphere, I think it would look more professional if they had a dress code."}
{"text":"Something amazing happens when people take great pride in and master their craft - perfection. Solid five stars for the best shawarma plate I've ever had ANYWHERE and that's comparing to places like Mi-Va-Mi. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming to all coming in to try their authentic cuisine. This isn't a super fancy restaurant but it is clean and tidy, well priced, and the portions are very generous. My favorite is the chicken shawarma plate (although the wrap is just as satisfying) which they pair with perfectly cooked saffron rice and a salad which they toss fresh every time just for you. At 10.99$ a plate it doesn't get much better than that my friends.."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Paramount - love the shawarmas, the manakeesh and those fluffed, soft pitas. Mmmm ...so delicious :)"}
