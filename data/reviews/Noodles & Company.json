{"text":"Its an OK place, with decent pasta dishes, a fast food type of place with awful decor, the cheap \"urban look\". The floor is always a mess with food and trash all over, almost overtime I have been there. I like the pesto dish.."}
{"text":"This place has recently opened with huge lines. Everyone, ORDER ONLINE! You can order from their website and pick up at a side window, skipping the entire line. When we did this, we were a little earlier than our specified order time so we did have to wait a little. If we had arrived on time, we wouldn't have had to wait.   In regards to the food, I ordered a small pesto pasta and had low expectations. It actually was better than I thought it was going to be. The pasta and tomatoes with it were very fresh. There were supposed to be mushrooms but I think I had one in my entire dish.   The portion size was so generous I actually thought they had given me a large instead of a small. I was eating with a friend and she ordered the peanut saute which looked very small.   I would recommend not eating at this location. There aren't many tables and since the dine-in area is encased in glass, it's very loud.   I would probably return."}
{"text":"tried the asian dishes, the japanese noodle one has so much sodium! the thai style ones were bland tasting, the peanut sauce noodles was the best of the bunch. the chicken and steak had the texture of those frozen tv dinners (like swanson), but the price for what you get, given it's in prime real estate is ok. i'd prefer to spend my money on better food though."}
{"text":"In the world of fast food, this joint tops them all.  Fast food that tastes good, vegetarian friendly, with service.  They provide a good choice of healthy drinks and meals.  Diversity in the fast food world.  I love it."}
{"text":"I just love Noodles & co.  Went today with a work group, we had such a diverse order: 2 x Indonesian spicy peanut Udon noodle with pork Penne with tomato cream  Pulled pork sandwich.  Mine was good (spicy peanut, no meat).  I would wish for more broccoli and carrot though, it's not like those ingredients are expensive.  There was plenty of noodle and sprouts though. So glad they opened a location on the north side!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain, but you'd be hard  pressed to name another fast food joint that offers up a bigger variety of freshly prepared dishes, fast service, and beer and wine! I'm partial to the Japanese Pan noodles but pretty much everything is above average."}
{"text":"tastes like all the other noodles and companies. 3 levels of seating which is cool. I'm just visiting Madison so don't go if you're visiting too bc it's nothing special!"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, cheap, but not yet perfect.  Pros: +Fast, freshly prepared food (I haven't had to wait more than 10-12 minutes after ordering in 3 visits so far)  +Food quality is good, it's quite delicious, but not \"to die for\" ;)  +Nearly all entrees are $5-7/plate, which is a great deal for the quality:quantity of food  +Not crowded by the college crowd  +friendly waitstaff (for a corporate chain, it's always nice when the people serving you are happy and kind)  Cons: -Tables have been sticky, even though they've been cleared, which isn't fun cleaning your own table via water from the drink machine and napkins.  -Crowded by the middle-class family with young children crowd--always seems to be a single mother or small family with one or two uncontrollable children (in additional to their other little ones). If you're looking to find playdates for your kids, maybe this is a plus, but otherwise this isn't why I go out to eat.  -No wifi (this is a silly negative, I realize, but the other N&C locations I'm used to, offer wifi, this one has a password if it even is on, which is 1/3 times so far)  Neutral (but random) I've seen cops eating here 3/3 times so far, with their significant other while on duty. Depending on your perspective, that's either a pro or a con, but I think it's just slightly random, and a little weird, but good on them for finding ways to spend time with their loved one(s).  If you've eaten at one N&C shop, you'll be familiar with the food (even though I live in WI now, and it just seems weird that even in WI, they call it \"Wisconsin Mac & Cheese\"...), but I would"}
{"text":"Outstanding food at any location (well okay, I've only tried the Oakland and Monroeville locations but that's sufficient). I'm ecstatic that Noodles & Company found it's way to Monroeville though, and they certainly don't disappoint.  The whole concept of the place is pretty cool. It's sort of fast food, sort of restaurant. This location is clean and bright on the inside. You have the options to dine-in or take out, and the wait is only around 5-10 minutes. Another great option is they offer beer, or you can use the cool Coke machines. I know a lot of people like those, but personally I'm not a huge fan. It's basically various watered down flavors that mix together to create your desired concoction.  The Japanese Pan Noodle with marinated steak is the best item on the menu if you ask me. Piping hot, fresh, and the texture is unique and delicious. I have yet to receive an order that disappointed. My friends and I used to go to Noodles & Co. all the time for lunches while attending the police academy, and every time we went we enjoyed a flavorful meal.  Great establishment that will serve you quality food at reasonable prices when you need an impromptu dinner or a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We were the first customers in today and the restaurant was very dirty. The tables  were not wiped off from the night before and there was all kinds of noodles and food on the floor and the drink station was not clean . Probably won't be back!  If the dining room looks this filthy, what does the kitchen look like?"}
{"text":"This place is very dirty! I went here and there were about 5 open booths/tables, all of which had been \"cleaned\" but there were still pieces of cheese and pasta all over! The food is pretty good for a fast food restaurant. But the service is bad. I ordered a steak stroganoff with mushrooms and got no steak. The person who served us our food also spoke to us multiple times, but we could not here a word he said. Would not recommend unless you don't care about bad service and a dirty environment."}
{"text":"Well- we stopped in because it was a new place to eat and we love noodle bowls. we asked the order taker what the size of the bows looked like, the small was pretty large to me , so I ordered a small bowl of noodles. no mushrooms. what I got was bowl of noodles that barley covered the BOTTOM ONLY of my bowl, I was in shock. I would say maybe 6 bites. WE LEFT! -TABLES WERE FILTHY. -FLAVORS WERE BLAND  Never going back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times have been disappointed. Both times it took at least 20 minutes to get our food. That the longest I've ever waited at a Noodles & Company. The staff isn't very friendly or helpful. The first time we went I paid for extra mushrooms and there were 3 mushrooms in my food, my food which was supposed to already had mushrooms and was supposed to have extra added in it. When I said something to one of the staff, she got an attitude and said that they are busy and that's extra mushrooms. Once I showed her and said there are only 3 in there, she reluctantly offered to get me more. She then slammed it down on the table and said \"here.\" Tonight I got my food to go and was very disappointed. I got the Pesto Cavatappi and there was almost no pesto on it. I got a side salad which has the dressing container inside so cutting my salad in about half. The dressing container was less than 1/3 full so it makes it seem like they are just using it to take up space so they don't have to give you as much. I am VERY disappointed in this location. Noodles & Company is one of my favorite places to eat. Even though this one is the closest to my house, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and in a hurry while in Market Square, this is the place to go. Good, quick, and cheap."}
{"text":"Eh. This is not good food, people. Any restaurant in the area could do noodles better than what they serve as noodle dishes here.   I ordered the mac n cheese. Big mistake. Their idea of Wisconsin mac n cheese is a plate of buttered elbow macaroni with the tiniest sprinkle of shredded cheese (was it even cheddar?) I may be a newcomer to Wisconsin, but I refuse to believe that resembled Wisconsin mac in the slightest. Basically I felt like a 5 yr old eating pasta with butter.   The noodles were dry and rubbery, like they had either been sitting out too long or reheated in a microwave. Ick.   We ate because we were hungry, but vowed never to eat here again.   I give 2 stars for three reasons: 1- the staff was friendly. 2- they seemed to be in the middle of a busy rush, so I'm hoping the food is usually slightly better. 3- I only ate here once and I think I would need to give it a second chance to justly say its one star territory."}
{"text":"I placed my order at 6:29pm on 10/11/2016 for a single order of Spaghetti and an order of 3 cheesy garlic bread. There were a few people behind me in line at this time. I didn't receive my order until 6:55!!  26 minutes I waited for my order!! In this time the customers who had placed their orders after me had already received them and had either left or was almost finished eating by the time my order was called out. I could maybe understand if the restaurant was super busy, but it wasn't. Not by any means. About 15-20 minutes of waiting, I walked up to the counter and asked about my order.  The (cashier) asked one of the staff if they had my order ready, which he turned around and responded \"waiting for the garlic toast\" with sarcasm and attitude.  I will not be returning to this restaurant and I recommend to others the same thing.  Plus the elevated price for the quantity of food you receive is way off balance. I'll just go to Carrabbas from now if I want pasta. It's better priced, heck of a lot quicker and tastes delicious. Plus you have leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"Decided to order my food online and pick it up at the counter, but guess what? The employee there decided to ignore me and not called my name even though my food was ready to pick up and was on the counter for ready to pick up. I don't know what her issue was but she totally ignore and called other name that are familiar to her such as her other customer Michael and Sadie. Yes, I am Asian American, and the fact that she decided to either ignore my order and doesn't want to call my order because of my name and nationally, it's sadden me how America has become. Yes, I did paid for my food at around 12:22 and waited for 30mins until I got my food. Come on, it's a take out. I know that's it's lunch time but it's just wrong how I was ignore like that.t"}
{"text":"Just paid nine dollars for a large chicken ceasar salad and got all the way home to a few pieces of lettuce  and cheese in a To go box. F my life. This review is to always check your orders at this location. It's happened to me three times now. Should've learned my lesson by now about checking they got your order accurate."}
{"text":"As a longtime customer of Noodles & Company in other states, I was very excited when this location opened in Tempe. Unfortunately, my experience today did not match the excellent customer service and food that I know and expect. I ordered the Pad Thai, but after 20 minutes of waiting, I was told that they had run out of rice noodles and could not complete my order. I was asked to order another dish and when that came out, it did not have all the ingredients as described by the menu description. I am disappointed in the handling of this situation as we received no explanation or compensation for the lack of ingredients."}
{"text":"Came to see what's the buzz all about, saw a long line and thought the food must be great. I am disappointed. I had better noodles and pasta some place else. Beside the annoying and irritating beeping sound coming from the kitchen that goes off every few second the food isn't really that good but over rated... REALLY IRRITATING..."}
{"text":"This place is alright, but I prefer Nothing But Noodles by far. The two are very similar (choose a pasta style and add meat if you want), but the selections are more extensive at NBN and they offer more customization options (veggies, etc). The only nice thing about this place is that they offer 2 different dish sizes, which could be nice if you're not terribly hungry- and they also serve soup (though the one my husband ordered wasn't very good). The dish I ordered here wasn't bad, but the quality was noticably lower than a similar dish I order regularly at NBN- I got it with grilled chicken, and the meat was a pressed pre-formed patty.. not terribly good.  I probably wouldn't go back, but if I were in the area and starving I may give them another shot."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here and it won't be the last. The employees are very helpful, recommending the best and least favorite dishes. I had to go back for seconds (a first for me). The monteamore is a must if you're a cheese lover. Nice location, very clean, and probably child friendly. Not too pricey and you definitely get your money's worth. The food is great, not heavy or over sauced like a lot of Chinese food places."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten somewhere and felt bad about yourself after? That's kind of what this has been like. There are SO many wonderful choices in South End that i feel bad spending $11.oo here."}
{"text":"The food come quicker each time and tastes worse each time. The food is barely warm and had a weird smell. Although it's cheap but probably won't go again."}
{"text":"The world needs more noodle places and I really wanted to like this place.  Pad Thai with chicken ordered, and finished oddly unsatisfied.  The entire dish seems bland and lifeless. No oomph, nothing that awoke my inner gastronomy from its slumber.  I suppose I'll try it again, because like I said...... .....the world needs more noodle places."}
{"text":"Basic, inexpensive comfort food for a cold afternoon. I had the American buttered noodles which I enjoyed. The Asian options, sampled on previous trips, aren't so successful as the straightforward American ones. Don't come here expecting too much & you wn't be disappointed. My only problem was with the meatballs which have a rubbery texture and are difficult to cut without a knife. I'll skip those the next time. Decent iced tea, unsweetened, is a good alternative to sodas."}
{"text":"The most unorganized staff I've ever seen, and it was not busy at all. It took about 25 minutes for one of four dishes to come out, and another 25 minutes for my wife and kid's food, only after I approached the cluster people standing around in the kitchen. By then I was almost finished. Then to top it off, my son's had to be sent back because it was wrong.. Amazingly, they had a replacement within 2 minutes. I don't get it. The person who I'm guessing was the manager was less than apologetic and near confrontational. The only reason this got two stars, was the food was decent. Lost 3 stars on the service."}
{"text":"I totally don't understand how this place is considered cheap.  You get a fairly average serving of either a (1) tomato tasting pasta, (2) a mac n cheese, or (3) a soy sauce tasting pasta and a soda and it's over 10 bucks.  That does not seem cheap to me.    Yeah, it's pretty good, but c'mon, it's not worth the price."}
{"text":"The cashier person is so impatient, unfriendly and rude. The pasta itself is not fully cooked (it is still too hard). The taste is standard."}
{"text":"I`ve wanted to try this place so for so long. The steak stroganoff is the best pasta I ever had. Can`t wait to try more different dishes. When I told one of the employees how much I wanted to try here he gave me extra survey codes to get free appetizers for the next visit."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly.  I ordered the Spicy Korean Bowl and the Alfredo Mont Amore Bowl along with the Pot Stickers.  Spicy Korean Bowl (in the picture) is noodles that are tossed in flavor sauce with meat.  What I received was soup that drowned out everything and it was so overpowered with sauce that I had to fish the noodles up and shake them off to try and taste anything but drowning spicy glop.  I had a few tiny tiny bits of meat that I could barely tell were there because of the overload of sauce in the bowl.  The whole thing tastes like burning spice that chewed like noodles were in my mouth as well.  The Alfredo Mont Amore Bowl was served upside-down so I thought they missed adding the topping.  I dug around and found all the stuff on the bottom and found out they put in giant cuts of unripe tomatoes, and they included 2 tops of the tomatoes (where the stem is pulled from).  To be fair, the noodles here tastes good with oil and cheese and the chicken tasted good with a flavored breading.  The Pot Stickers were very bland and they need another dipping sauce other than a mild sweet spice sauce, something more salty would pair better.  Each bite was a sweet, spicy bland texture when you start chewing and the only way to taste anything with these is the dipping sauce.  The Pot Stickers themselves were absolutely tasteless by themselves, they need to flavor the outside because it taste like dough.  I've heard nothing but great things about Noodles Company but all the great reviews are from the one in Charlotte.  I have a coupon for a free bowl, I'll try it in Charlotte, but I'd rather pay money at any other establishment than go to the Gastonia one again.  Even if the food is free."}
{"text":"Last night a friend and I went and ordered the chicken Caesar salad and a pad Thai to share. There were several customers in line ahead of us, and the cashier looked like it was his first day on the job. He was nice but moved slowly as if he weren't completely acclimated to his surroundings. We had ordered drinks and then had to ask for the cups.    Our food came out pretty quickly considering how busy it was, but when we asked the girl for two additional bowls, she never brought them to us. I ended up having to get 2 to-go containers for us to eat out of. As we started eating, my friend noticed a hair in the pad Thai. I took the original bowl that the pad Thai was served in, along with the 2 to-go containers, to the register area. The girl who was supposed to bring us the extra bowls yelled out \"can we help you?\" Given the situation, I didn't think it was appropriate to yell out there was a hair in my food, so I moved closer so she could come over to where I was standing. I told her about the hair, but she only took the to-go container that had the hair in it from me and said they would make another one. Then she walked off and left me standing there with the other to-go container and the bowl. So I called her back and explained that all of the food came from that one bowl, so she could get rid of the whole thing.   I ended up having to go back up to the register to get the new order about 10 minutes later, and they made 2 orders for some reason and ended up giving me both. The food was good but the service was really lacking."}
{"text":"This place is having a carb identity crisis. Asian noodle dishes, Italian noodle dishes, Mac and Cheese, Beef Stroganoff.... So the name of the restaurant is correct, but to call it Asian/Chinese/Thai is misleading. The first impression walking in (other than the schizophrenic menu) is a cute, clean interior. Nice colors and decor is nice. The food was unfortunately disappointing. I had the Bangkok noodles with a chicken add on. The curry was very mild. I added my own sriracha to give it any inkling of flavor. The chicken resembled Tanning Booth Mom's face and tasted like an Ugg boot. The only upside of this visit was their manager on duty. He was running the food to my table and apologized for the chicken. He brought me another piece that was cooked properly. His customer service was outstanding. The rest of the staff was awful (register and cooks). He will undoubtedly get a better job at a better restaurant because I can't imagine this place will last long. A Chipotle would do much better here. And for the price, I'd rather go to Ramen Bar in Squirrel Hill for much better food that really is Asian."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Formulaic fare and sadly very underwhelming. Save your money. There are much better options in the area.  Based on the look of the place (inside and out) I was really looking forward to what Noodles & Company had to offer. Sadly though, the food simply didn't deliver. One gets the distinct sense that the food was conceived in a test kitchen and then simplified to be prepared, at scale, by someone with limited cooking skills. Bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"Chicken tastes like rubber! So weird. Flavor was good though. I ordered the pad Thai. I told the manager and he gladly made me another with beef. We shall see...."}
{"text":"I love Noodles & Company, but I do NOT love this location. Everything is disposable because it's in the mall, so it's more wasteful. And because of the seemingly smaller containers, it feels like you're getting less food. There's a separate eating area for Noodles patrons, so I don't see why they can't keep that nice feel like at other locations."}
{"text":"I literally loved this place. They had really good customer service and made my absolute favorite dish (Indonesian Peanut Sautee). But today I came in and found out they removed that dish completely from the menu. Why remove the dish? Why not just add new items to the menu?"}
{"text":"Super excited to try this out but.... Wasn't thrilled.     Menu wasn't very exciting but we tried it out.  Was told all meat was extra, so if you had the chicken Veracruz salad the chicken would be an add on side. Food was good, a bit spicy which was odd though, but nothing exciting.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is decent. The service is good and fast, but the food is not great. It's edible, but not good enough for me to go back a second time. I had the Pad Thai and added chicken, which cost me an extra $3. The chicken turned out to be fake and the noodles gummy. I would really not recommend."}
{"text":"It's nice to see more lunch options in the Path but I found the food disappointing.   I've had:  - Indonesian Peanut Saute: lacks peanut flavour - Bangkok Curry: curry flavour doesn't stand out  - Thai Hot Pot: curry flavour doesn't stand out, but lots of ingredients   As you may notice, the running theme here is lack of their namesake flavour. The food actually has enough taste, but the flavour they're supposed to carry was extremely mild.   The food was served within 5 minutes of ordering, which was impressive but the food was lukewarm, not hot. The online ordering tool is handy if you are taking out or tight on time, but it doesn't seem necessary as it wasn't busy at all the last time I ate there."}
{"text":"Out of towners here.  Spent the night nearby and my wife loved other noodles and company.  The staff was very friendly.  However my food was really not good.  I think my noodles had been cooked much earlier in the day since we went for an early dinner and it was deserted.  They tasted like leftovers.  Couldn't eat even a third before my stomach threw in the towel.  My wife's were a little better, but our opinion of the chain has taken a dive.  :(  I'd rather wait 12 minutes for freshly cooked noodles than have it ready in 3."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place and eat almost once a week when we are in the area. The staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company...universally loved, almost.  I say almost because there seems to be an attitude among foodies that this chain sucks.  I, personally, don't think it sucks, but it could be a lot better.  The main problem with this location is the size of the restaurant itself.  It would probably get three stars from me if not for this problem. There is simply not enough seating to accommodate the amount of people who want to eat here on weekends.  I'm not a fan of waiting for tables unless the restaurant is REALLY good, so I've just walked out a few times before placing my order.  When I do stick around, usually I feel really crowded due to the close proximity of the tables.  There are also lots of little kids, who may or may not leave you teetering precariously on the brink of utter madness.  It's probably better to go during the work-week.  The food is reasonably tasty and quickly served, but inconsistent.  The noodles are always cooked perfectly but sometimes the sauces come out too watery.  The ability to add meat (or tofu) to any dish is helpful, since some of the dishes are pretty bland otherwise.  My favorite recently has been the penne rosa, which has just the right amount of kick.  However, for a place devoted to pastas, and considering the rather high prices, I expect to be more impressed.  You probably already know if you like Noodles & Company or not. If you aren't familiar with this chain and are thinking of trying it out, I would not recommend this location; there are quite a few others in the Madison area which are less crowded.  For a quick bite, Noodles is pretty good, but you can do better."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with pesto cavatappi, but there were many times where whatever it is I've ordered, the dish would be bland..."}
{"text":"Best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Love the variety and clean modern environment. Great for lunch or dinner. Fast service and great quality food. Came here with some friends for lunch and was not disappointed. Definitely recommend this for anyone in the mood for pasta/noodles."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch if you looking for pasta,  noodles or salad bowls.  The staff are quick and service is awesome. A must try is the Mac and cheese and add some parm chicken"}
{"text":"Of the several times I have eaten at Noodles & Co., the food has been fairly decent, consistently good, but nothing to write home about. I like the variety of choices, but it can get a bit overwhelming, if you keep on wondering to yourself if the particular combination you picked will actually taste good or not. I have stuck with western-style pasta, as opposed to asian noodles (why eat faux noodles at this place when you can walk a block and have real pho noodles?).   A regular bowl of noodles, meat, and a side soup will run you $8-10, which isn't enough to fill me up completely, but it is nice to enjoy some well-cooked noodles once in a while. The atmosphere is pretty great, perfect for groups of people and for individuals. It actually feels like a fast-food place disguised as a restaurant. It's very roomy inside, and there are huge windows that let you look out onto the busiest corner of campustown."}
{"text":"Discustingly dirty! Barely a single table in the entire place was bussed. It was well after the lunch rush and they didn't appear to be busy. I have never seen a dirtier soda fountain, ew. I had to use the restroom but was afraid. I have been to noodles before many times in the past but I strongly advise against this location. My husband ordered the pesto chicken. There was hardly any pesto. The staff were college guys who didn't seem to really care about anything. It really grossed me out and I will never be back!"}
{"text":"tried the new bowls w/o noodles.  reasonably tasty.  the spinach could be cooked just a bit, but i suppose they would have to put more in then.  they are always skimpy on the vegetables.  at least there were more carrots in these bowls.  but why is this location ALWAYS out of tofu when i visit?  seems like they could estimate the demand better."}
{"text":"There isn't much positive I can say about this place. We had the Spicy Korean bowl and a side order of meatballs. The Korean meatballs were okay, although they kind of reminded me of Ikea meatballs with a sweet  Gochujang sauce. The Spicy Korean bowl was very sweet, without much spice at all. The sweetness of the sauce overpowered the entire dish. Unfortunately, this will be the first and last time we eat here."}
{"text":"Took 25 minutes to get our food. When it came it was cold and only got two of three orders. Sent food back. When finally got our food it was hot but the brought me the wrong order. Brutal.Mineral point road is way better. Make the 5 minute drive as you will get your food quicker and hot."}
{"text":"This is your standard Noodles&Co. chain restaurant with nice seating and ambiance.  If you've been to one before, then you should know what to expect, it's more or less the same.  For those of you who haven't been to one, they offer slightly higher prices than you'd like to pay (but not enough that you'd outright stop going), and a somewhat large variety of noodles, ranging from Oriental to your standard Mac&Cheese options, as well as soups and salads.  Most of their more exotic dishes range from okay to the not-so-surprising 'WTH was I thinking when I ordered that' response, but a few are really good and worth coming back for.  Personally, I don't eat here unless someone else really wants to go, and then I usually order the Mac&Cheese which is my current favorite there.  Plain and simple noodles with a bunch of gooey freshly melted cheese.  Yum.  One good thing about it is that it is located in the heart of campus, so it's a convenient place to stop in for lunch or some other quick meal.  It is surrounded on several sides by completely glass windows, though, so it can be a little strange getting some private time with people from the street looking in at you."}
{"text":"My 6 year old niece got me hooked - if given the option, this is one if her 5 regular choices to eat at... in the running with a sushi restaurant and a french cafe (the girl doesn't have bad taste!) I highly recommend Noodles & Co. instead of some fast food place. They have a variety of dishes & you can customize them. Great meal when you're in a time-crunch - or just too lazy to make dinner! The small portions are perfect! The employees are also very friendly."}
{"text":"I was at this location a week ago and I ordered a new dish they have, its called Thai hot pot, I was really looking forward to try it and unfortunately it failed completely. It was a big bowl with 90% water and 5% coconut milk (if there was any), three pieces of shredded chicken and pork each (all gummy), 5-6 spinach leaves, some noodles at the bottom and a few tomato chunks, the only good thing was the flatbread, nice flavor and crispy. I ate some since I was hungry but I will not ordered it again. This is not the  first time I get a bland dish at this place, I think it's losing quality."}
{"text":"High quality food with very speedy and efficient service. Staff members were friendly and helpful. Would come again."}
{"text":"Japanese noodles were so hard I could barely chew. The mac n cheese hardly had any flavor or cheese. The chicken noodle has a weird chalky flavor."}
{"text":"The place is convenient, reasonably priced, and pretty good food.  I've come here a number of times for lunch with colleagues, as it is a nicer sit-down place not too far from campus--it's clean, spacious enough, and comfortable.     The menu consists of several noodle options--American (Mac, spaghetti & meatballs), Asian (Japanese pan noodles, pad thai, bangkok curry), and Mediterranean (Italian pasta) and several salad and sandwich options.  All the meals are vegetarian by default with small (about $4.50) and regular (about $5.50), though you can add meat (chicken, steak, shrimp, meatballs) or tofu for about an additional $2.50.  I recommend the noodle options--after all, it is called Noodles & Co."}
{"text":"Noodles is one of my absolute favorite restaurants.  I have been coming here for years because the food is delicious and comes out quick and the staff are amazing. They have the best customer service and truly care about their customers. The pasta is delicious and fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. Food took over 30 minutes to get to our table, watched other tables who sat down after us get their food first. There was only one girl who was bringing orders out and she was running around like crazy. I noticed she was even bringing bowls out for the same table several minutes apart. She noticed we looked annoyed and asked us what we ordered (shouldn't that be on their computer screen? Shouldn't she be able to look from the number that is sitting on our table??) We told her and a few minutes later she came back with our food. My bowl was the wrong size, we were missing a soup and bread. She came back, brought the bread, asked if it was ok just to bring another small pasta instead of a regular size, and said the soup was being cooked. Ten minutes later she returns with the soup. NONE of the vegetables in the soup are cooked. There are raw mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes sitting in a soup. My spoon falls out of the bowl as an employee is walking by. He picks it up and says \"guess you don't want this\" and walks off. I assumed he would be brining another but he never did! The additional noodles she brought out to supplement my undersized bowl are missing spinach. I go to refill my water. None comes out of the drink machine. When we are about done with our food (too frustrated to bother with the soup) the manager comes to our table and asks us if everything is ok. I said no and proceed to attempt to tell her everything that went wrong. She cuts me off and says she is going to issue a refund. I'm glad she offered a refund but her attitude was horrible. She did not seem genuinely sorry and I would imagine a good manager would want to hear all issues so they can be addressed with employees. When she comes back with the refund receipt, she has refunded everything except a fountain drink. Hilarious! It was just another cut in the already terrible experience. I will never return to this location. I am a frequent customer at the noodles and company on south boulevard. The south blvd location is wonderful, they are extremely friendly, they get food out within about 5 minutes, and the food tastes great. They have made a mistake before but it has been very minor and they seemed genuinely sorry and offered me a dessert!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a fair meal at a good price......don't eat here.  If your hungry go elsewhere.  Especially don't get the bare serving...... there is nothing there.  Find another place in same shopping plaza, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"lack of identity, the Asian noodles don't look nor taste like it, the pastas are the same. Taste like cooked by bunch of students, taste very plain. just like cooking from school."}
{"text":"Food is yummy... I'm a vegetarian and I love this place. The only thing that disappointed me is the quantity of food. I'm not sure if it's worth the money. Coz of this i had two bowls... japanese pan noodles (decent) Indonesian peanut saute (awesome) In all... you should try it once for sure..."}
{"text":"Tasty noodles and friendly customer service! They have so many menu options to choose from and I will definitely go back to try them all!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Compared to the Mineral Point location, this location is sub par!"}
{"text":"pesto cavatappi w/ parmigiana chicken... and a ciabbata roll on the side... with butter... and a smile...  this dish is so damn good i wanted to reach across the counter and slap the hell out of the cashier as a thank you for recommending that i top off my pasta with chicken parmigiana.  the pasta was good but with the chicken... damn.  and since in italy bread is considered an eating utensil i ordered a ciabatta roll on the side.    my name is jeff and i'm addicted to pasta..."}
{"text":"The noodles taste good but would not reccomend the chicken at all. The chicken is that tasteless rubber chicken stuff. Very disgusting  You could spend $12 on real chicken instead of this stuff."}
{"text":"I was so bummed after eating here. I ordered the penne rosa with parmesan crusted chicken ( I normally order this at the monona one which always seems to be awesome!) and this really sucked.  No flavor, no parmesan even though I asked for parmesan, it was dry and barely edible.  Such a sad dish! Avoid this one if you can."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Excellent service. We came in as a family and everyone ordered a dish, apparently one of the dishes was missed by the cashier. My daughter ordered it  but cashier didn't ring it up and I didn't notice he missed it on the receipt. When we all received our food served my the manager he asked if they missed anything aware that one person did not get any food. We said her dish, but when he went back and looked it was never placed and I looked at my receipt and it wasn't paid for, by me. He without questioning me just brought her the item and said we will cover this and rushed her order so she could enjoy lunch with us. Definitely will return :)"}
{"text":"Food is always great tasting and ready in no time! Also they have a great variety of pastas and sandwiches.  Can't say enough about how awesome this place is!"}
{"text":"For me, Noodles & Company is a nice change of pace, with a good variety to satisfy most people in your party.  I've been here a couple of times, as well as locations in other cities.  I don't disagree, Noodles  may not be the best value for a college student.  Good thing I have a job!  I appreciate the variety offered, with standard American fare (mac and cheese, meatballs) to Asian flare (Japanese noodles, pad thai).  Granted, none of the bowls will astonish you in the taste bud department, but I think it's a nicer option than your other Forbes Ave. choices, such as Chipotle, Primanti's, or Five Guys."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at the Monroeville location while driving through to WI from DC.  We both thought it was the best Noodles restaurant we've been to so far, and we've tried multiple locations across the country over the last 10+ years.  Food was cooked really well, especially the Parmesan chicken (very crispy) and penne noodles (al dente like they're supposed to be).  The staff was also super friendly, and really cared about how we were enjoying our food.  We chatted for awhile with the manager (Brittany) who was very sweet and nice.  Really great experience overall, and we'll be trying to stop back at this location on all our road trips."}
{"text":"Went in here after the movies, friendly staff, easy to understand menu.  Food was good, really strong favors. I got the tomato soup and it was rich and delicious.   Also got the spaghetti and it was good.   I'll def go back if at tmp."}
{"text":"First and likely last trip to Noodles.  In Madison for a sporting event and dragged there by the family.  They were busy but not even full.  Waited 30 minutes for chicken noodle soup, BBQ pork mac & cheese and garlic bread - actually my son had to run down the server because she couldn't find us.  I suspect she had been searching for awhile as I was in no danger of burning myself on the soup or garlic bread.  The food was ok.  My workplace cafeteria serves a better chicken noodle soup tbh. Also, you would think I would get a napkin with the meal.  Nope.  Apparently Madison has very neat soup consumers."}
{"text":"The pad thai has no flavor and the mac and cheese tastes uncooked. Two stars only for the homestyle ambiance in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but wasn't great. I could have created the same ramen noodle at home.  Kinda blah."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff! Anthony and the other staff member were awesome. Wish they could accept tips. Will be back. Great pasta place, definte have to try if you have not yet."}
{"text":"I won't be returning. Today, I picked up an order for my friend and I. They read back the order and it was exactly what it should be, but when I got to work, they had not put a rice krispie bar in even though they charged us for it. Additionally, my Japanese Pan noodle bowl left much to be desired. The carrots were uncooked (even though they were supposed to be) and \"topped with cilantro\" means one slimy spring of cilantro with 2 leaves on it. My friend's pasta was burnt. Burnt! While I like Noodles & Company in general, this location is lacking."}
{"text":"Opt to try noodle company over chili's because it was new to the area. Though my dish ( pesto cavatappi) was tasteful, it was cold in spots. As if they put cold pasta with warm pasta. The tomato basil soup was \"ok\". Nothing to sing about. My husband had the Pad Thai and just looking at it I can tell it dry. Overall, since it looked like every there was new I would give them a 4 out 10. But next time I will go next door to chili's."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just to write this review.  I like Noodles Mac & Cheese.  N&C has always skimped on sauce on takeout orders, so I usually dine in.  My mom recently decided to pick up a Mac & Cheese for me when I was ill and could only eat soft food.  Since it was takeout, she ordered extra sauce hoping I wouldn't end up with half a bowl of sauceless noodles again.  Mac and cheese is supposed to be a creamy, saucy dish.  The bowl I received didn't have a regular amount of sauce, let alone extra.  I checked her receipt, and yep, she did pay for extra sauce.  Most of the bowl was dry noodles.  I stirred it to see if maybe the sauce was on the bottom... but nope, just a small amount in the center of the bowl.  I literally couldn't taste sauce, it just tasted of plain pasta with a little melted cheese on top.  I've been signed up on N&Cs email list for years,   so I receive their surveys and I always comment on their Mac & Cheese needing more sauce- especially for takeout.  This was the last straw, I'm done with N&C.  Their food isn't cheap, and pasta is so inexpensive.  No reason to cheat us on sauce."}
{"text":"No idea why this place doesn't have better reviews. It's pasta people. Order it how you want it. It's good. It's hot. It's fresh. Love this franchise!"}
{"text":"Came here on a week night and the food and service was excellent. Came here on a Saturday and it was horrible. I ordered the buffalo chicken Mac and the chicken was so burnt and had no taste what so ever. My wife's chicken was rubbery like it was old. There was also no ice in the machine and took them a good 10 minutes to refill. Although one of the gentlemen did bring us a cup of ice to put in our drinks."}
{"text":"I would never confuse good Asian, Thai, Chinese, Korean or Japanese food with Noodles...but if you're hungry and looking for something filling and delicious, this will fill the bill.  Yes, its a chain, yes, there are better choices, but for the money, Noodles will fill you up and put a smile on...well, it will fill you up."}
{"text":"I just ate at Noodles & Company.  I had the Pork Adobo.  This was a one and done experience.  The Italian olives was a strange mix of flavor.  Did not quite fit.  A lot of elboe noodles with adobo sauce.  Kind of dry and spicy.  The pork was dry and not much of it."}
{"text":"Too bad Noodles doesn't have a frequent diner program. My daughter would eat Noodles Mac& Cheese every night ad infinitum. Not sure I could eat here nightly but we seem to manage at least once a week. Although Mac & Cheese is always on our order, I tend to supplement all that gooey goodness with a salad and you can't go wrong with any of Noodles choices. The Caesar is pretty darn tasty with a hint of anchovies in the dressing and big crunchy croutons, The Med salad is another favorite that is quite filling on its own. Hubby tends towards the Mushroom Stroganoff with the yummy flatbread slathered in faux butter. Oh the Potstickers aren't half bad either. I should add the location in Monona has a drive-up window for phone ahead orders and with a turnaround time of 5-10 minutes why wouldn't any working mom have this place on speed dial?"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting gourmet noodles - it's a fast food restaurant technically. However, the food is pretty good - nothing too special, though. I usually get the buttered noodles or macaroni and cheese, which is satisfying enough. The other dishes I've tried, though, were not tasty, which is why I stick to my regulars."}
{"text":"Luv the new buff bowls..   Tried the Tucson chicken .. Only about 360 cal and it was really good..  As usual the service here is really good and friendly"}
{"text":"I really like Noodles and Co.  I've tried most of the dishes they serve.  I have not found one I did not like.  My favorite are the Pina Rosa, Japanese Pan noodles and the new MAC and Cheese dishes.  I have gotten great service each time eating there."}
{"text":"Good food fast, but twice in the last month we've had carry-out orders where items we paid for were not in the bag."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. My kids don't like Pad Thai, or Bangkok Curry or frankly anything exotic at all. I on the other hand get tired of chicken nuggets, etc.   Noodles & co is the perfect solution - Mac and cheese or spaghetti for the kids; other more interesting carbs for my wife and me.   Everything is tasty, if a little bland, and served fast and cheerfully!"}
{"text":"If you're a young college student with disposable income and haven't yet mastered the application of heat to liquid dihydrogen monoxide until rapid vaporization of the aforementioned substance, then you'll love Noodles & Company.  Noodles & Company isn't particularly affordable, and in Oakland, you'll be able to find better Pad Thai or meatballs spaghetti in other establishments within a 3 minute walking radius from Noodles & Company - so I have a tough time understanding the niche this particular franchise seeks to fill.   I had the BBQ Pork Mac and Cheese and Tomato Basil Bisque. The mac and cheese, while perfectly acceptable, reminded me of the Kraft variety you'll find in virtually every Freshman dorm. The bisque, also perfectly acceptable, could have been replicated by thickening a canned offering from Campbell's with some sauteed onions and a dash of heavy cream.  The service required at Noodles & Company isn't complicated - and consists of a cashier taking your order, line cooks doing their thing and a runner will bring it to your table. Yet somehow the staffed struggled with the orders in our party of eight during a relatively small lunch-crowd. In addition, the runner decided to offer unsolicited commentary on the volume of food we had ordered.   While I don't believe that America's tipping culture necessarily guarantees good service, you can certainly tell when a Sphincter ani externus in the service industry isn't counting on tips to live (Noodles & Company's policy prohibits tipping).  At least the soda machine was cool."}
{"text":"Pesto cavapatti and Thai hot pot were delicious! Recommend the pork on the pesto noodles. Lemon herbal honest tea is the best! Customer service was good. Quickly brewed more tea when they ran out. We're coming back, definitely."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant October 14th 2015 and had Buttered Noodles. The place was a great place to eat. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. I had the steak stroganoff and truly enjoyed it. They have a great spice  that you can add to your meal. Overall will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Have to make it brief cause I'm not wasting my time on this.. went to enjoy the Pgh Regatta w/ friend and her 2 daughters. Decided on dinner here. Ordered meatball sub n ceasear salad. Lets just say the pretzel at the vendors was more appealing. First off, 95° out and felt like a/c wasn't even on,. Meatballs clearly were under a warmer for quite a long time. Had one bite and that was it. Asked my company how their \"food\" was and basically said \"adequate\". Was the downtown shithole."}
{"text":"They have amazing customer service!!!!!!!! The good was delicious as always, however they went above and beyond today!!!!! Even though we were ordering gluten free, due to my daughter having celiacs, they were kind, courteous, and beyond helpful!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. I was pleasantly surprised. I got one of the salads that had cilantro and avocado Vera Cruz maybe? Whatever the name it was very fresh and delicious with the jalapeño ranch already mixed in. Girlfriend got the Korean beef noodles bowl which I tried and we both really liked as well. I'm going again soon to try more items but I can already tell from this first experience I'm going to enjoy much of the menu here."}
{"text":"Their portions here seem to be more generous than other Noodles and Company Locations.  I had a regular sized Japanese pan noodles and barely touched it and was full.  Food was good, and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I've tried a few different dishes here with my boyfriend and one of my friends. They have pastas, soups, salads, and sandwiches, and some desert items. Have to say the penne rosa is my favorite dish and I love their potstickers as well! I came when they first opened but as time went on I feel the food preparation got much sloppier, (it still tastes great!!) and the restaurant was a bit dirtier. It may just have been bad timing when I came it but it was difficult to find a clean table last time I came even though they were all empty. And the area where the drink are kept need to be wiped down. Decent food at least."}
{"text":"I think it is a good lunch place when your short on time. Its not fast food but its not sit down but somewhere in the middle. I like the concept of a noddle place. I had the pesto past. It isn't the best Italian (lets face it nothing is except Italy lol)  but for a non Italian only joint it was pretty good. I would go again but I think  I would order a Thai or non Italian dish the next time."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. First time going and the food was great. Lots of options. The only thing was the garlic bread in the picture is misleading and you get a very small portion size for what you're paying but people rocked and great concept."}
{"text":"I was surprised by some of the mediocre reviews, but decided to give it a try anyway.  I was pretty impressed. I shared the small Pesto pasta with chicken, a side caesar salad, and a side of tomato basil bisque with my 5 year old for eleven bucks.  We both liked all of it.  The pasta was similar to fancier restaurant pasta that you would find at Macaroni Grill or Carrabas but cheaper and in a fast food setting.  The area was clean, employees were polite.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here because a coworker suggested the place. The wait to order the food wasn't bad and the food arrived quickly. After finishing half of my bowl, I noticed a hair as did an en employee who overheard me complaining to my coworker. I was told to take it upfront and I did. I received an apology from the cashier. In a situation like this I would have expected the manager to come out and own the issue."}
{"text":"I have been to Noodles and Company twice - and I have been very disappointed each time!  My first try was about 6 months ago.  I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken...and it was probably one of the most terrible things I've ever been served.  It was absolutely bland and half of the noodles weren't even cooked.  I couldn't eat it; I had to just throw it away!  I wasn't expecting a great Thai dish, just something edible.     So today I was running errands near Noodles and thought I would give it another try.  I ordered the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese, thinking I couldn't possibly go wrong with their \"most ordered' dish.  Unfortunately, my meal very disappointing again. It was just very plain.  Not enough sauce for all the noodles, and the sauce that was in the dish barely had any flavor.  Not worth it.   I'm not sure if these issues are related to this particular store, to consistency issues, or just to poor recipes.  Either way, my two experiences warrant a rating around 1 or 2.  I'm going with a 2 since it is a nice-looking place....and they must be doing something right since it's always so crowded!  I'm just no longer willing to keep ordering until I finally find something that is ok."}
{"text":"for fast quick noodles this place is very good. kind of a weird menu (the \"american\" side contains pasta with marinara and stroganoff). i had the peanut noodles with tofu and it was great. it's nice that they offer small and regular sizes. i could/should have just gotten a small. also nice that they sell beer."}
{"text":"Was really happy to see this open up in Tempe, I first went to it in Salt Lake City. It was as good as I remembered. Got the penne rosa with grilled chicken and it was delicious.  This was the first time my husband went to it and he loved it too.  Just wish they would open one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Noodles location. It's right down the road from where I live and SO convenient. I just pick up the phone, make my order, drive down the road and my food is ready for pick up! The whole process takes less than 10 minutes during peak lunch hour. There's no place as simple as this and you still got hot delicious food.   I always get the spaghetti with braised pork. I love the way they cook and season the pork to make it moist and flavorful. The spaghetti sauce is savory and just perfect. It's really comfort food at its best.   Some reviewers did not have a pleasant experience which I find strange. Most of my visits, I've been greeted by friendly staff who are super efficient and get me what I needed right away. Love it, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place. We came based on the positive reviews here. I know this is not an authentic Asian restaurant, so I tried to give them a lot of leeway in that regard. Also I do enjoy my fill of Americanized Asian food.   I got Pad Thai. But what I got was definitely not Pad Thai. All I can say to describe it is... it's like someone tried Pad Thai once, then forgot what it tasted like, and then a year later tries to make it using only items you can find at Publix and added an extra cup of vinegar. If you like Pad Thai, I do not recommend this dish just because you'll be disappointed. If you've never had Pad Thai and love strong vinegar taste, then you might find it okay.   They also have traditional American food like spaghetti and meatballs. Nothing special though..   On a positive note, the workers there are super friendly and attentive, far better than most chains I've been to. Also the prices are decent, so I suppose you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Meh. I had a craving for potstickers and decided to give the Monroeville location a try since it was on my way home. There was almost no filling inside and they were very flat. They were greasy and really lacked flavor. The food was ready very quickly but it was very loud inside and I didn't like the Five Guys/Steak and Shake feel of the place. All in all, I was expecting more. Guess I'll be getting potstickers elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and ordered pot stickers forgot to ask if there were mushrooms since I am allergic to them. Found out they did have mushrooms and the manager had to void the payment, she was not very nice about it even after I said I should have asked before I ordered and paid. Yes it was my fault but I admitted it and she was still rude....."}
{"text":"I dig this place. I, too, have had the Pan Fried Noodles and Truffle Mac, and liked both a lot. I liked that this place had so many vegetarian options. The unsweetened, fresh-brewed, flavored iced tea was also more than worth it! The service is a nice combination of being served the food without being constantly checked on.  They also make very good cookies. Good cookies are important."}
{"text":"More Colorado influence approaching the valley and thus far I love it. Less like a pasta chipotle and more along the lines of fast fresh casual.   Very fast and friendly service; good amount of local canned beers and bottles from Colorado (saw new Belgium and one other I didn't recognize).   Between the two of us, had one Mac and cheese and one Tuscan something or other. The Mac and cheese was very traditional in that it was pure elbows and light cheese sauce. While good in theory, this one missed the mark of the best Mac and cheese in Arizona. The sauce was too viscous, pasta a touch undercooked and overall not flavorful. It's not that it lacked speciality ingredients but more that it lacked strong cheese flavor and was largely just \"there\". The Tuscan was pretty impactful with a hearty whole wheat pasta and picked red onion, Parmesan, and other ingredients.   Pretty good and relatively cheap fare.  Worthy of cheat meal? Your call, probably hit or miss.   Mac and cheese? Okay, but lack luster. My journey for the best Mac and cheese in Arizona continues."}
{"text":"It is okay if you are really hungry. We ordered Japanese Pan Noodle. It tasted a little bit sweet, so we add spicy sauce. I think I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  They have a detailed listing of allergens which helps those of us with restricted eating. They were fast, friendly, and fairly priced when we went. Only way to get it up to 5 stars is a better price or more food for the price - I can be hard to impress though."}
{"text":"First time there last night . loved their Wisconsin chess steak sandwich and chicken noodle soup. Fast service better than any other food court option. Employees friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I really like Noodles and Company. It's typically very reliable, great for families, and an affordable meal...Except when they miss the mark.  In this case, because the East Madison N&C is the only one near the area, they were very busy and we completely incapable of keeping up with quality and service. My family and I went to there on a late Saturday afternoon. They were unusually busy with not many seats available, but because line was shorter, we took a risk and ordered the regular Mac & Cheese, Pad Thai with Tofu, Japanese Pan Noodles with Chicken, Asian Salad and a couple of those amazing Rice Crispy Treats.  FOOD TASTE/QUALITY: After waiting an understandably long time, we were quite taken back with the lack of attention given to most of our meals. First, let's start with the ridiculously large bowls in comparison to the portions. The food was literally dwarfed in the bowl. Not sure who made this decision, but it was a bad one. The Mac and Cheese worked and was on-the-spot (pretty standard for them); the Japanese Pan noodles had one small piece of broccoli and -- oddly -- other random noodles (see pics); Pad Thai was sporting burnt tofu, and the salad was missing several ingredients, including crispy noodles. The overall taste was fine, but the quality and details were way, way of the mark.   PRESENTATION: As mentioned, the presentation was grossly off. Huge bowls, wrong ingredients, and little attention to detail.   PORTION: We did not go away hungry (thanks in large part to the Rice Crispy treats), but the portions were very hard to gauge because the presentation was so off. I actually had to ask them if it was the kid sized portion or the regular, because we literally could not tell the difference in the gargantuan bowls.   PRICES: Regular Japanese Pan Noodle with Chicken is $8.84 with tax; Mac and Cheese is $6.11 with tax; Pad Thai with Tofu is $8.63 with tax, Chinese Salad was $6.01 after tax; and those Crispy treats are a buck eighty-nine each. Typically, I don't have a huge issue with their prices, as the food quality makes it worth the price. However, in this case, $40-$50 for mediocre food made it a bit hard to swallow.   DINING EXPERIENCE: As mentioned, it was really busy and the employees were doing what they could to keep up. But, this was a management problem. They did not have enough people working to handle the amount of customers there, and the capacity of the location was certainly maxed out. When we questioned the staff about the portions and missing parts, they didn't re-make it (the right answer), but brought us out the missing parts one-by-one: steamed broccoli, crispy noodles, tofu, etc.   FINAL NOTES/IMPRESSIONS (2.5 to 3 stars): As I said, I have expectations of N&C and typically like their food and atmosphere. The Madison East Towne Boulevard location did not meet the expectation. While I like the company, as a whole, this location brought the reputation down a notch."}
{"text":"The very basic of every restaurant is to serve delicious foods. I had tried all Asian noodles and their basics are awful. At least, if you want to have Asian noodles, please consider other places."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The dishes all taste wonderful and are very quick to be served. The staff here are great and it's always been a pleasant time being here. Only once have we had a bit of a problem - we waited a little longer for our food but the staff was amazing and comped our meal. They definitely care about their customers here and will make you a priority. Nothing bad to say about this little restaurant."}
{"text":"Sooooo dissapointing!  I'd been wanting to visit this place for a while and finally got my chance on a recent Sunday afternoon. When I walked in, I was surprised to see that it was nearly deserted. But since this was my first visit, I was also happy because it gave me more time to linger over the menu options. Good Start!   When I was ready to order, I moved to the register, and was glad to see an employee already standing there, waiting for me.  I started telling her what I wanted -- \"One Spicy Korean Beef Noodle bowl, One Alfredo Monta--\". She cut me off mid-sentence to yell down to  the other end of the counter to ask one of the guests who had approached what he needed. After a conversation with him, she finally turned back to me and just stared at me -- no words.  I wasn't sure how much of my order she'd captured before she was distracted, so I started over, which resulted in her giving me a second Beef Noodle bowl that I didn't want.  It was corrected once I realized what she'd done, but I couldn't help but think that if she'd let me finish giving my order before she'd interrupted for the other guest, then maybe the confusion wouldn't have happened at all.  While waiting for my food to be prepared, I started looking around the dining room.  Several tables were dirty, one had a few noodles sitting on it, others had scraps of paper on them, one had a cup. They obviously needed to be wiped down from previous customers. I saw 3 employees while I was there, one taking the orders and 2 preparing the food. Since there was no one behind me in line, and only a handful of customers, I wondered why the place wasn't  cleaner. Finally -- the food.  Portion sizes were good, presentation was nice, but all 3 items -- Korean Beef Noodles, Alfredo MontAmore, and the potstickers were blah.  They reminded me of something you get in the  frozen food section of the grocery store and then take home to microwave.  You know the ones where the picture on the box looks amazing, but the taste is just \"meh\"? Yea, it was like that.  My teenage son, who's a big pasta lover, suggested that we skip this place any time we want noodles in the future.   That's saying a lot because I think that that kid would eat cardboard if it had cheese sauce on it.  So, needless to say, but we won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Sorry guys I'm definitely not impressed with the food. Great and friendly staff though!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying, I LOVE noodles&company.  However, this location has messed up the last time.   I was there 3/21/16.  Probably around 8pm.    Line moves very slowly because the girl at the counter was also taking the calls (throughout the visit, I had seen at least 5 or 6 different staff so someone else could have done that so she could take orders).   I ordered the pad Thai with extra sauce, no tofu, because they were out. AGAIN!  every visit I've had to this place they have always been out of something. Last time it was the cheese for the Mac and cheese. I wait for about 15 minutes as people get there food that came in after me.  I can hear the girl at the counter telling customers trying to order that they are out of this or that.     I finally get my food, and go to the station were they keep the lemons.   None are there (just like last time) Takes me 5 minutes to get a staffs attention before they tell me they are actually OUT.    Tables and floor were littered with trash.  Honestly never seen any resteraunt so bad.   I should have asked for my money back.  I paid 10 dollars to get food I didn't even get how I wanted, and wait in a disgusting dining area. I have been to many other noodles and have never been disappointed!  This one however needs some serious changes.  The only thing this noodles had Goin for them was a mostly friendly staff."}
{"text":"Horribly slow to get your food, even when you order ahead. The soda dispenser was broken, which they didn't bother to fix despite still selling soda cups to customers"}
{"text":"My gymnastics team and I came here the night before a competition, hoping for a nice team dinner. The morning of the competition, a vast majority of us felt sick. Some of us were nauseous, some had the serious poops, and the unlucky ones received both."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I Ordered Pad Thai to go. There weren't any peanuts, 3/4 of the bowl was sprouts, I could barely find the cabbage and did not taste any form of sweet chili or cilantro. It's basically a bowl of dry noodles, little egg, few carrots and sprouts. Eat next door at Panera or Chili's"}
{"text":"The environment is nice, but the food is not worth it. I ordered the Bangkok Curry. The rice noodles were all stuck together, and the sauce was just sweet. Not much more flavor. It was terrible. In addition, there wasn't much else other than noodles. I didn't add protein, but there weren't many vegetables on my plate, either.  My dad ordered the Japanese Pan Noodles, which didn't look much better."}
{"text":"Wow. We stumbled upon this place while Halloween shopping next door. We had three hungry kids with us and no idea what to order. The staff was amazing. They helped each one of us and made suggestions after hearing what we liked and didn't like. Travis (if not a manager, should be... Or even general manager) was amazing! He checked on us and the kids twice. I can't say enough positive things about Travis and the rest of the staff! The restaurant was very clean, welcoming, and the pasta was the best! We will definitely be returning at least twice a month from now on and it's a 30 minute drive for us.  Thank you to Travis and the rest of the staff for helping us order, making us comfortable, and truly delicious food."}
{"text":"Food was  great and inexpensive.... Customer service was awesome... I can't wait for my next trip back to Charlotte"}
{"text":"I expected more out of this; but the food is not worth your dollar. For me, this is  no-no going forward."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fall & winter comfort food! They have 2 different sizes (small, regular) of noodles in 3 categories: Asian, American, and Mediterranean. You can also add chicken, shrimp, tofu or steak for a few dollars more. When I do order chicken breast, it's a very generous portion. You can add a soup or salad for $1 more.   The Bangkok Curry and Indonesian Peanut Saute are really yummy. They're flavorful and always made with clearly fresh ingredients. I haven't tried the 'American' entrees yet since they're things I could easily make at home. They look good though. The Thai Curry soup is absolutely delicious on a cold day!   Both the cashier and the person who brought the order to my table were cheerful and polite. The atmosphere is simple but classic and comfortable. They have one of the fun Coke machines that lets you make any combination of drink. It's always very clean, and the dining room is nice and quiet outside of the lunch hour.   This is really good fresh comfort food for a very reasonable price (especially if you go meatless). Though it's not quite as authentic as you'd find in an ethnic restaurant, the entrees are every bit as good or better than what you'll get at an Olive Garden or chain Asian restaurant, but for a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Eh. This was my first Noodles & Company experience. I was quite excited by the Gluten Free options and I thought it tasted very good. My husband did not care for the food. I think I was just excited to eat something I normally can't. The service was okay. It was easy to hear staff having side conversations or complaining about something. And they blocked off a section of the upstairs section and said we could not sit up there as they were cleaning... however, no one was up there. And no one was cleaning. Very confusing. I know it was late at night, and you don't want to clean as much, but put something up indicating rather than saying HEY! you can't be up there....   Good food for your after downtown Friday night outing tho!"}
{"text":"Don't go during business lunch hours. I waited 25 minutes for a salad order that ended up being poorly assembled and missing the main items, chicken and apple. I paid 9 dollars for lettuce and some feta cheese! Give me my money and time back! They're obviously not staffed to handle the volume of orders during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Order taken wrong; wrong change given; Penne Rose so slathered in hot sauce it was inedible. Employees standing around, horsing around and yelling at one another.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"New place, definitely has some kinks with ordering and service, but its bound to improve. I had the Japanese noodle and was underwhelmed. The noodles and sauce weren't bad, but nothing special. The vegetables were sparse and though the quality of the meat (chicken for me) was pretty good, there wasn't much of it. For a big American chain, I was disappointed with the portion size, and the taste didn't compensate at all.  The lines seem big, so maybe I'm missing something. I may go back in a month or two to see if they've figured it out."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Management and staff are incredible! Their customer service is genuine. The food was absolutely delicious! So fresh and tasty. I loved that I could pair a glass of wine , pinot grigio in particular, with my meal. I had the Alfredo montamore and my bf had Bangkok curry.   I highly recommend Noodles&Company to everyone! Please check them out in Pickering!"}
{"text":"I am indeed a fan.  I have gone thru most of the noodle and soup menu (no salads and no sandwiches yet).  I tend to order by the calorie count - so as to preserve the ol' waistline - and if their calorie count can be trusted, then their fare is a tasty and healthy treat.  I find the asian noodle dishes to be my favorite.  And I am always very satisfied with the portions ( I order the small bowl).  In fact, the tasty goodness of the noodles typically causes me to keep eating even after my brain is telling me \"hey buddy, you are full\".  In the winter, I was getting chicken noodle soup and  the small noodle bowl and that was A LOT of food.    Today I ordered the small Indonesian w/ Chicken, a large soda and a rice crispie treat (so good), and the total bill came to $9.38.  I find that to be pretty darn reasonable for Oakland faster-food."}
{"text":"My main purpose of this review is to specifically declare my dislike of the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese at Noodles & Company. If you actually like Mac & Cheese, stay away from this version. It is the blandest tasting Mac & Cheese I have ever eaten. It is little more than lightly buttered macoroni with some shredded cheddar cheese on top and no seasoning whats-so-ever. I find it hard to believe that people older than 8 would actually like this dish. It upsets me that they have this item on their menu, without a warning or description of how bland and dry it is.  I did get the Mac and Cheese with the additional meatballs, which were quite tasty, if not a little too salty. However, the extra salt was needed to make the Mac & Cheese edible.They state this is their number one seller but I don't beleive them. It is likely their most profitable item, considering I paid $8.00 for some buttered noodles and three small meatballs.   The Mac & Cheese is surprising to me, considering that the other dishes I have had in the past were reasonably good. I usually order the more Asian-inspired noodle dishes. I also believe they have good staff who serve many customers quickly and efficiently, especially considering how busy this location is at lunch."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! This place is a rip off. My husband ordered a pad Thai noodle bowl (yeah, I know who does that at a Noodle to go place, right?!). He shows me his Regular size to go bowl which was half full of noodles, a slice of lime and a few barely recognizable pieces of egg. I told him to take it back and request a refund. He did and the manager refused to give him his money. Won't be back ever and will be reporting them for their awful business practices. If nothing else, this review will help others beware- it's $8 for a bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the strogonoff with tofu and its always excellent. They also have HUGE rice krispie cookie and snickerdoodle cookie that are beyond awesome. It can get packed in the evenings and on weekends but if you go at an off time or during the summer, you seldom have to wait."}
{"text":"I was disapointed bc i was excited when this first opened. I expected it to be good like the noodle restaurant on elizabeth ave downtown charlotte. It definitely tastes different."}
{"text":"I am so furious!! Every time I have gotten food from this place it is wrong!! Is it that hard to get someone's food order correct!!?? I use to love getting food from Noodles & Company but not now. I am disgusted!! Who ever decided to get rid of the cibbatta rolls was wrong on that one too."}
{"text":"Finishing a delicious lunch - the Thai curry soup is very good - sweet with a little kick; the Bangkok curry had plenty of vegetables and noodles prepared just right. Definitely will return and will download the app for to go orders."}
{"text":"Stopping in for lunch after driving from Chicago on an empty stomach, I was starving. I ordered a small Penn Rosa dish with Parmesan Cheese and Pot Stickers.  My server accidentally gave me a regular sized pasta dish and some very flat pot stickers. However I barely waited for food, and who can complain about getting more than they ordered?  Aside from the pasta being spicier than I had anticipated and the pot stickers lacking volume, it was a suitable place for someone to get a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"After years of avoiding he chain, my resolve faltered and I gave it a try. The dishes I have tried were the japanese pan noodles with steak and the bangkok curry with pork. I don't want to get into details  as I feel I may just come off as ornery but suffice it to say the flavors were bland and predictable and the vegetables undercooked.   I don't believe I will ever ever return. The success of these type of restaurants could be the source of an interesting philosophical discussion on what people expect from their food, what are common food standards of homemade dishes, etc."}
{"text":"This place has gone seriously downhill! Haven't visited in awhile (opting for the drive thru pickup). Went in today for first time since winter and it was filthy. Bathroom was dirty and every surface in the restaurant was covered in smudgy handprints, easily visible in the low evening light - doors, Coke machine, condiments bar, door to the kitchen, etc. The A/C also seemed to be barely working on one of the hottest and most humid days of the year, so it was stuffy, sticky, and humid. Food was pretty normal Noodles but I don't ever want to eat in there again. Really disgusting and sad - used to be a great quick option with 2 little kids."}
{"text":"So happy they have this in Arizona now! Taste just like the stores in Minnesota! I love this place."}
{"text":"I love this chain, but am never certain what my dish will be like, even though I order the same thing every time. I order the Pesto Cavatappi (I request no mushrooms and they always get the correct order). The only issue that I have is from location to location, the amount of pesto in my dish changes. Honestly, it's barely there sometimes. The tomatoes taste fine, but there are usually just 5 big chunks. I'd prefer smaller dices and much more than just 5.  I'm going to return (to any noodles location), but would love to see some improvements and much more consistency in their orders."}
{"text":"Does not travel well. Dumplings were flat, as though they'd been ironed. Pesto noodles were awful, despite adding shrimp. Got part of the order wrong, my friend has a food allergy and ordered accordingly, but got double the ingredient instead of none. Dine in, not out."}
{"text":"Here's a classic example of how different franchises can be.  Noodles and Company used to be my go-to quick meal for their version of Pad Thai, Japanese Pan Noodles, Mac and Cheese or Pasta Fresca (a penne with spinach, red onion, tomato, feta and balsamic sauce) in placed like Kansas City and Denver.    But the chefs at this location are what make it a little less perfect than the other locations.   (The Trio, a noodle dish with a protein like shrimp, braised beef, chicken or parm chicken + a salad...my fave! My husband and I frequently got the big square bowls for take-home dinner with friends.)  The service is great, no doubt, real friendly and helpful.  The tables get cleared when people are done eating.    This franchise lacks a chef who prepares the dishes properly.  The noodle dishes don't seem to be cooked at a high enough temperature, leaving the noodles a bit limp and pale.  (In turn, barely flavored.)  At other locations, the Pad Thai for example is tossed in a piping hot wok, so the sauce caramelizes a bit around the noodles and the flavor intensifies.    The vegetables here can be spotty.  Sometimes they're properly prepared and firm but not raw...other times, they're downright crunchy, like the red onion has been very undercooked and strong.   Please, N&C, properly prepare your dishes so they're mouth watering.  If some Yelpers think this location is good...just wait until you try different locations, or when they switch-up chefs!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and its meets expectations.  Service was fine, food was good, and we go it an out.  Its a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Ordered the Korean beef noodle dish to go ($9.30).   -Literally waited for 20 minutes to get the food. -When I opened the bowl back in the office, it filled less than half of the bowl (Looks like they only used the equivalent of 1 ramen instant noodle pack). -There was no beef. The image of the dish clearly depicts pieces of beef in the bowl, same as the written description.  Will not ever go there again, don't want to get swindled again."}
{"text":"As someone that loves noodles and Co in other states I was pleased to see this brand new building hosting one of these pickup and go resturants.  Typically I order something simple with no complecated demands or restrictions other than peanuts and pork.  Pros:  This location has the nicest staff.  They are alway so happy to take your order.  Parking is also good and close to the store.  The outdoor eating area is also very nice.  Cons: This location looses three stars because the food just isent any good.  The noodles are always stuck together, overcooked or extra dry.  Seems like the quality of the food is less than its other locations."}
{"text":"This Noodles is close to work, and I have eaten lunch or ordered carry out from this location 25 times in the last 2 years.  Service is always prompt, food is good quality, and they've only goofed up my carry out twice.  The second time I had ordered a med salad with grilled chicken only to find no chicken when I got back to the office.  I called and the manager made it right with me by sending 2 free Noodles bowl gift certificates via email.  Pretty happy with the way they conduct business, and will continue to eat there.  Clean tables and washrooms as well."}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of pastas. They're a bit expensive for pasta, but the large portions are big enough for two people. I had the beef stroganoff and chicken noodle soup. The beef stroganoff had a really unexpected flavor. It was almost tangy which was really odd. I was expecting a creamy flavor. The chicken noodle soup was just basic canned soup. They had a bunch of other pastas I'd be interested in checking out, but I probably won't get the beef stroganoff again. The service was decent. There was a really sweet girl who was new serving me. They bring the pasta to the table which I thought was a little strange since it's such a small place. Overall, this place was pretty good. I'll probably come back when I'm not in a Chipotle mood."}
{"text":"Love it, quick grab n go options for a young family.  Recommend it as an option similar to a Chipotle."}
{"text":"Wanted a nice Thai noodle dish but didn't realize their Thai noodles are all 'light' dishes. This place is NOT customizable as they make it seem. The sauces are all pre-made so you can't adjust the spiciness or choose your noodles. I wanted the dish with peanut sauce but since that's their spiciest dish (was told they can't adjust that), went with the Bangkok curry. Did not have any curry flavour and not a lot of sauce in it. Actually it barely had any substance to it. I was still hungry after. Had it with their Thai soup - good, but again not filling at all. Realized after that the 'large' noodle dish was under 500 calories and soup only 130 and low in sodium, which is great for a dieter and I appreciate the 'health' part but I had to buy a second lunch right after (and I am a very slim person). I think their specialty is the American pastas (mac/cheese, Alfredo, pesto, etc). So perhaps those are better as they seem to be more filling with a lot more substance to them. But if you're looking for good Thai noodles, this is not the place (unless you're on a diet)."}
{"text":"Been to many different noodles locations and am usually pleased.  My husband and I were sick one night and wanted something warm. I placed the order online and my husband went to pick it up. Ordered a pesto cavatappi and a Thai hot pot. Chose no mushrooms for the hot pot. When my husband picked up he confirmed with the cashier that there were no mushrooms. However once we got home there were a lot of mushrooms that he had to remove. More than usual. Called to let them know they offered to make a new one but we are 20 min away and didn't want to make another drive there. Manager offered to send coupons but two weeks later they haven't come. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't normally complain or comment about restaurants but the tomato bisque soup was horrible! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone and the Parmesan chicken pieces were over cooked.  This location needs a new cook, I have been to this location previously and it seems to be lacking something as well as it never seems to be very clean.  I hope they start making improvements but I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to both the Pitt and CMU campuses and has decently priced (sub $10 - you can get a dish plus soda for about $7.50) and decent food for the money. If you want more food for the money Chipotle may be a better option. They also have good a good, clean seating area and get your food to you fast.  I've had the Japanese Pan Fried Noodes, Indonesian Peanut, and Truffle Mac. Of these, I would have to recommend the Truffle Mac. It's more expensive than the other dishes (it was $11 for it and a soda), but it tasted really good. Friends I've went with also enjoyed in the regular Wisconsin Mac and cheese.  They have a Coke freestyle machine (the one with the touchscreen so you can choose your flavor of Fanta, Coca Cola, Sprite, Root beer, etc.), which is fun to use to test new combinations."}
{"text":"Okay.  We are suckers for this place.  It's way too expensive and totally not prepared to order obviously, but some of the items are just so good.  The Alfredo with tofu is bomb.  My daughter loves the buttered noodles.  True, we could make this at home for less than a dollar, but she likes it and I love going there too.  If they dropped the prices we would go more often.  Not the healthiest but better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab dinner and chose Noodles as we expected a shorter dining time than a full service restaurant. We ordered four items and were the only diners in the store. It took over 30 minutes to get three noodle bowls and a 6 piece order of bread. Each person's meal came out separately and the bread came out last and after we were well into our meals. No real apology from the staff and excuses for our every concern. They had six visible employees and only one customer (us) to serve in a timely manner. We have plenty of restaurants to support in the community but this shouldn't be one of them."}
{"text":"1st and last time we will go there. Had to ask to have our table cleaned before we ordered our lunch. Order was wrong when it got to the table. There was no taste of curry in the curry dish.The beer was warm ,after bringing it to there attention I was told 15 minutes later that it would be 2hrs before the beer got cold.All in all the food was bland."}
{"text":"Great food! Customer service was great too. I had the pesto pasta and it was so tasty! I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"great food, maybe a tad expensive. The salad I had was one of the better salads I've had and it tasted very fresh as well. Indonesian peanut saute was very good. Service is quick as well."}
{"text":"I frequent Market Square every day, and I've been really impressed with how it has developed in a vibrant restaurant scene. There are so many good choices in the square, and Noodles and Company is a nice addition. It's basically a nice fast food place, like Moe's or Chipotle. They serve (or will serve) one basic and one premium kind of beer and wine by the bottle.  ($17). Along with salads and other sides, the noodle dishes are split among three categories: American (e.g., stroganoff, mac and cheese), Italian (e.g, pesto, penne rosa) and Asian (e.g., pad thai, japanese udon). You can add protein to the dish, as you want. The dishes can easily be made gluten free (rice noodles) and/or vegetarian. Small and large portions are available. They list a number of dishes that are 500 calories or less.  It's a great little lunch place, and I'm thrilled that it's joined the Market Square neighborhood."}
{"text":"Noodles are good, but the soda machine is my favorite part.   For my first time here I decided to try a bunch of things, I specifically went with a bunch of people so we could share. I ended up sampling the mac and cheese, penne rosa, tomato basil bisque, steak stroganoff, and the Japanese pan noodles. Everything was good, maybe a slight cut above the average noodle joint, though macaroni and cheese was easily my favorite. Sadly, the pan noodles were a bit too charred, though they substituted them for another dish without any hassle. The soup was pretty good, and it costing only a buck extra with a meal was pretty nice. It's a busy place and the interior is a bit too cafeteria-like for me (though the tables themselves are nice).   The real highlight for me was the soda machine, almost worth the trip in itself. It's a new touch screen set up which has all manner of coke products and allows each one to be customized with different flavors (strawberry sprite, orange coke, etc). The only downside is only one person can use it at a time. It certainly brought out the kid in me.  I had high hopes from what people had said about this place, but, while good, the food just wasn't anything exceptional."}
{"text":"Nice spacious place with friendly workers. The portions are pretty good as are the flavors. I've heard mixed reviews about their pad thai and I've had a lot of pad thai from different places and I have to say, I was pretty satisfied with their pad thai. I can't wait to try their mac and cheese with buffalo chicken!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give 0 stars.   I came in here expecting a quick, easy lunch, but this was far from it. I ordered a salad of the menu, but boy was that a mistake. After I ordered, I patiently waited for 20 minutes, during which time I watch the salad girl make the two slowest salads I've ever seen made. It literally took her 10 minutes per salad. While I watched in disbelief, I observed not a single cook or line person, including what appeared to be the manager wearing gloves. Horrifying. However, I figured the salad girl was using tongs at least so I continued to wait. Then, it happened. She fumbled and dropped a bowl. I watched her pick everything up off the ground and he proceed to put dropped ingredients into my salad that I had waited close to a half hour for at this point.  I no longer wanted my food or food poisoning after seeing this. I desperately tried to get someone's attention to cancel my order, but couldn't and actually had to leave with no food and out my money!!!  I will never ever be back."}
{"text":"Good mix of fast food and quality asian. The mac & cheese is a big rip off. I had the Pad Thai and it was very good. When I went no one else was in there so I did not have any problems with the order. I wish we had one of these in Cola-town. The iced tea was also very good (black tea)."}
{"text":"This bufu place sucks. In general noodles has bomb food, but this place took legit 2 hours to deliver and I asked for gluten free noodles and they didn't give them to me. Last time I'm ever going there."}
{"text":"The staff are pretty friendly here every time we've visited so far. I would recommend the Beef Stroganoff and the mac and cheeses for all the pasta lovers!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Madison, WI area and stopped in before 11am to have lunch. We were the second table in the restaurant this morning. Ordered three meals...they all came out wrong. Spent $30 for nasty half-servings of food.  All orders were approximately half-size portions but I paid for full size. The Thai Hot Pot had chunks of the hard, bitter core of the cabbage. The chicken was just nasty and they didn't give me bread or lime wedges.  They did not bring me a side salad. I had to go back up for that.  The full size grilled chicken Caesar salad I ordered came out in a small bowl with NO chicken. I took it back up to the counter and asked why such a small bowl for a full size order, and they said \"we are out of the big bowls\" (they had just opened half hour earlier and we were 2nd customers). They did add some chicken after I took it back up.  The place was dirty. The area around the soda machines was disorganized and dirty. The entry rugs rolled up and laying in the hall way by the bathrooms.  We eat at Noodles & Co a lot in our hometown and it's never been like this place!"}
{"text":"Everything is wonderful about this. Location is close to the UNCC and University City CMC Hospital! Delicious food and an affordable cost. The only thing I recommend is providing wifi, since I usually work while eating. 5-star place! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I got spaghetti and meatballs to go. Too little sauce and meatballs were hard as a rock.  Would have given one star; however, I gave three because of the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best pastas from foreign country's in one location. Best ideas yet. Great service, order only takes a few minutes. Props hands down!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The food, the service.  I was worried about a noodle place (mushy noodles ick!), but the were done perfectly.  I got the small Alfredo monte, the size was great and very tasty. Everyone had a smile and a hello and was very patient with me. I can never make up my mind."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant 1 time with my wife, it is a shame because food was great but the service, friendliness were not good-get some happy people and the restaurant will be sucfesful"}
{"text":"I've tried a few things. They're very consistent with the quality, and since I go during lunch hour, they do fairly well with the time as well. However, I am a vegetarian. So there aren't too many healthy options for me, which is why I am giving a 3-star.   But for all you meat-eaters out there, this is a great place. :)"}
{"text":"When driving I always pass this place and it's fairly new. I figured I'd give it a try. Not sure if I'll ever come here again. This is my first time eating at noodles and company. I ordered their popular truffled macaroni and cheese. The pasta was over cooked and dry. The chicken had no flavor . Maybe I should have stuck with noodles my food would have been better. I paid $14 for a meal I was not happy with. The staff was really nice and greeted me immediately. The staff is the only reason why I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars upon the insistence of my son. It's his favorite place to eat! Goodbye fast food burgers, fried chicken nuggets and greasy pizza. The child has spoken!  My son's favorites are the buttered noodles or the spaghetti. I like several options including the pasta Cavallari with the parmesan crusted chicken.  It's somewhere between fast food and served dining. I like the pace and the atmosphere. Makes it a great family dining experience."}
{"text":"Very affordable eatery that tries to showcase other cultures foods. Good for lunches and has good variety of dishes for different people. The taste won't be authentic like the real culture but you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I usually do not write reviews about food establishments. But my experience here has compelled me to share it with you guys. Here is my take:  1) The staff is extremely incompetent esp during the rush hour. You have 4 guys and 1 girl shouting at each other over the counter. Honestly, having lived in 4 continents and 11 countries, I have never seen such incompetence,  2) During the rush our (11:30 to 1 pm), the food is often undercooked and is unnecessarily oily.  3) I ordered Pad thai to go (hoping for a quick bite), and after waiting for 55 minutes my food did not arrive. When I approached them again, they did not have my order in their system!! I kept my calm, and asked them to cancel my order. It took 3 guys, and over 15 minutes to figure out the refunds!  so a word of advice? RUN!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!"}
{"text":"First time. Order the Penne Rosa with chicken and the Indonesian Peanut Saute. The Penne Rose was good. Before I ordered the Indonesian Peanut Saute I asked how spicy is it? The gentleman said on a scale of 1 to 5, it's a 3. I eat hot/spicy dishes and this dish had my mouth and tummy on fire. I would say it's a solid 5+. It's nothing like the picture, there were hardly any veggies. For the taste, it was just hot not flavorful. I will say you pay a lot for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. In expensive. Great location. And a nice place for a family to come and eat lunch. It is similar to a fast food place with a combination of a restaurant. Th food tastes great and the service is descent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone whose in a hurry."}
{"text":"I was a tourist in the area and this looked like a good place to get a healthy meal that would taste good too. There are plenty of beer and burger joints around but I wanted something healthier. The day before I had a great burger so today had to be a better choice. This was different than any other place. They have a variety of cuisines represented. Some sandwiches, salads and noodle dishes, Thai, Med, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, a little of all.  l had the Med, with chicken, mushrooms, onions, spinach, bell pepper, cilantro, cucumber on a flatbread, with soup or salad $5.99. I had the Thai curry soup and also tried the Bangkok Curry noodle dish Small $4.39/ Lg $5.49. The Med had grilled white meat chicken, with fresh vegetables. The Thai curry soup and the Bangkok Curry noodle dish looked like the same ingredients. The soup just had soup over the noodles, and vegetables. Meat or tofu could be added to the noodle & pasta,  and salads. The meat choices, naturally raised pork, Parmesan crusted chicken breast, chicken breast, marinated steak,, shrimp, oven roasted meatballs, and organic tofu for $2.39 to $2.69. Over all I liked the choices, what kind of meat, no meat, size of dishes, and one of those new style touch panel multichoice soda machines. The people were friendly and the service fast. When I got there at about 6PM on a Tuesday nite, there were about 8 people in line to order and it took about 20 minutes from end of line to food. The Med with soup, small Bankok Curry, and a drink for $12.84. Yes! 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich gewesen.  Das Restaurant ist ganz schick gestalten. Die Essensportion hätte ruhig etwas mehr sein können. Aber es war sehr lecker gewesen."}
{"text":"Was looking for a convenient vegetarian option while shopping in the area, so we went in here. This place is not good. It was ridiculously expensive for what we got. Taste was just okay. The silverware is just set out in a bin and most of it was dirty. We had to dig through to find anything not covered in dried on food. Pretty gross. I definitely will not go there again. It was $22 for two bowls of noodles and two drinks."}
{"text":"First of all, I definitely wouldn't classify this as Chinese food as is listed here! It's a variety of noodle preparations \"from around the world\" including Asian, Mediterranean, etc. I have been going to various locations for 10 years and always come back: although there is an occasional error or less than ideal situation, you can't beat the variety, price, and convenience if you are a pasta lover like myself. I have had most of the dishes dozens of times- here are some thoughts:  Japanese pan noodles: the noodles are thick with a great mouthfeel. The sauce is a little spicy and tasty. Sometimes they don't put enough on there though and it winds up on the flavorless side  Buttered noodles: literally butter and noodles (and a very nice seasoning plus parm) but the egg noodles are very tasty and I often use this as a vehicle to add whatever fresh ingrediants they have in seasons ( mmm corn and asparagus)  Steak stroganoff: really tasty sauce but rich. Would get the small size   Pasta fresca: one of my go-tos. It has delicate wine sauce that I can't get enough of. Nice veggies as well  Penne rosa: I sometimes feel like the sauce tastes like vomit   Mac and cheese: literally don't understand why people like this! So plain and basic!  Pad Thai: inedible. You are much better off going to a Thai restaurant   Indian curry: delicious! Not a lot of noodles but good if you want more of a mix of veggies   Pesto cavatappi: a nice dish but I would ask for extra sauce because often it runs a little low    As you can see, sometimes the dishes are inconsistent, which is my biggest complaint. I find that this is worse with takeout too so I would try and eat in if possible !"}
{"text":"Was here earlier for lunch, had the Thai bowl, YUMMY!! Sent my daughter back for dinner. My dinner selection was lacking...everything. Upon returning, I was greeted with great customer service, and a remake of my selection, which came out tasty and great. I was given a coupon for my inconvenience which is always awesome. Either way, I Will definitely be back again!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to this location a few times and we normally have good experiences. I usually get the penne rosa with grilled chicken. But the last few times, the chicken seems to be a little overcooked and dry. Especially if you pay close to $9 bucks for pasta and chicken, it better be near prefect. I would rate 3.5 stars, but not 4 stars."}
{"text":"My first time in Madison, and my first meal was eaten here just now. It wasn't disappointing at all. I got 2 small orders of the pad Thai and the curry soup--both were fresh-tasting and delicious! I could have had a small, but sufficient, healthy meal with  just one. But at $3.95 a pop,, I decided to get greedy and try both. Now I am a bit overstuffed and feeling a little bit guilty by my constant failure at moderation, but happy nonetheless after a tasty, cheap, and wholesome meal, in a city that I'm enjoying, and which I'm  looking forward to explore further!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for everyone working there, but one older woman was extremely rude and unaccommodating. I am vegan and asked if there was a way to take off any cream or butter and she was very passive and clearly annoyed. Horrible service I wouldn't recommend to anyone ever!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's really disappointing to find the chairs up on the tables by 8 pm, when the store closes at 10. I'm pretty sure that's bad for business, but maybe the staff's desire to go home is the most important thing."}
{"text":"My kids love this place - they say it's the best Mac n cheese ever. I always struggle to find something I really like. I typically order a salad or the Thai hot pot. If you get a salad I would recommend requesting the dressing on the side - there's way too much tossed in. My big kids usually split a regular size and it's plenty of food which makes it a very reasonably priced meal for us. The service is fast, which is nice with kids.  Can't ask for much more in a fast food chain. We'll be back as long as my kids keep craving the Mac n cheese :)"}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy Noodles, but the staff at this particular location is just the perfect storm of ineptitude, inexperience, and disrespect. DO NOT eat at this location if you want to have an enjoyable dining experience. When I arrived there was already a line of five people, which took about as long as you would reasonably expect a line of 20 people to take. This was entirely due to the cashier, who must have had ADHD, because she could not focus on a single thing any customer said to her, without becoming distracted by whatever it was her coworkers were doing. She kept trying to finish her coworkers' sentences for them at the expense of paying attention to the customers, frequently looking up only to say, \"oh, you wanted a small?\" or \"wait, what did you say again?\" It was frustrating to experience and embarrassing to witness. She asked me if I wanted a receipt, to which I clearly and loudly said \"yes,\" but then I had to remind her three times afterwards that I still needed my receipt. I later discovered that despite my clearly enunciating my order to her (three times!), she had keyed it in wrong anyway, and at that point I felt too uninspired to go back and correct it. I ended up with the steak stroganoff, but without the steak. Also, they ran out of noodles. Yes, you read that correctly: a Noodles & Company restaurant ran out of noodles. Specifically, they ran out of the main type of egg noodles that they use for most of their dishes. I am not sure how a restaurant whose namesake, indeed the entire focus of their business, is noodles, can run out of noodles. So they had to substitute a different kind of noodles for the usual kind for me and everyone after me. Thus I ended up with a steakless steak stroganoff, on macaroni noodles. In other words, I ended up with plain macaroni, and a teaspoon of sauce. I was sitting with a somewhat large church group that had booked the private room off to the side, and the room was freezing cold. We all kept our jackets on because they might as well have had a window open (in February). The server who brought out the food was equally incompetent. Since we were a large group, he brought out our food in batches, but was unable to identify what the various dishes were. He literally did not know what any of the dishes were that he was carrying, which made the whole task of identifying who gets what into a circus. We had to have everyone get up to come and inspect the dishes to try and deduce which one was theirs. It did not help that nearly half of the dishes were not what we were expecting, since the cashier had rang them up incorrectly. The staff kept citing as their excuse, \"someone called in sick today.\" However there were at least four people behind the counter, yet none of them seemed to understand how to take direction from anyone. A manager was also present throughout this experience, but she was apparently useless, as she was not leading or directing the staff at all. Avoid this Noodles & Co. location like the plague."}
{"text":"I've been here over the course of four years. In my experience, there are better locations, but this one is tolerable if you're not that picky. One time, I ordered the potstickers, and this is exactly what they looked like when brought to me. 10/10, would Noodle again."}
{"text":"I love everything about this noodle place and wish more franchises would open. So you can choose your own pasta (whole wheat, regular and dozens of shapes), sauce, and protein.  Its basically a quick fancy meal that is made the way you like it and most importantly, FRESH.  I loved the steak stroganoff, mac n cheese with pulled pork, and pad thai.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"My family really likes Noodles - healthy dishes that taste great. We've stopped at this location 3 times prior to this visit and each time we remember that this one is very poorly maintained. The food is OK, but the dining area is dirty, the bathrooms are disgusting, and it's been that way since our first visit last year. We will give this place one more chance, but if it doesn't get better we will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Was barely ok cold food and dry noodles and a bit pricy for what you get . Would not recommend to anyone Genghis or Pei Wei are both better."}
{"text":"For a fast paced noodle shop, it's pretty darn tasty, reasonably priced, and fast.  The Thai curry soup is nice, Pad Thai, Peanut Satay, Japanese Udon are all respectable. Staff is friendly and the food tastes fresh. Yes you can get wine and beer too.  Not \"authentic\" or \"gourmet\" but great value."}
{"text":"The college student I was with seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was okay but I think I could have done better with a 30 cent package for Ramen noodles and some frozen vegetables, and I would have had 5 or 6 bucks left over. Really, it isn't bad food, but like the $10 dish of spaghetti in an Italian restaurant, you can't help thinking that somebody has just pulled a fast one on you an picked your pocket. Why bother. Really why bother? What is the point of this place? Buy a can of soup for $2 and you will feel better about yourself."}
{"text":"A neat idea for a noodle place.  Unlike the Japanese noodle places in Japan, you get to eat different kind of noodle / pastas from different places. You can seat in or take out.   You can order online and pickup in store. It is very convenient for business people who work nearby.    I tried the Steak Stroganoff pasta.  Personally, I am picky on cheese. The pasta smell so cheesy that I didnt want to eat it.  Yet, I gave a try.  It wasnt that bad at all.  The pasta was made to al dente.  It wasnt salty or oily!  It was good.  The sauce was delicious.   I would come back again.  I look forward for more choices on their menu! :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly pleased, I went here when visiting my daughter and the food was rather tasty. I like the idea of noodles with your choice of toppings or just plain buttered noodles - simplistic yet good. The soda machine was a neat novelty. Friendly staff and good menu to choose from, even soup and sandwiches if noodles aren't your thing."}
{"text":"Needs new management. 1 star for this location. Always dirty. Always short you on your order for pick up. My mac and cheese always tastes like garlic so I just stopped wasting 10 bucks for some cold noodles and ever elusive rice krispy that never actually makes it in my order lol."}
{"text":"We love having meals here. Nice manager and cashier. Very helpful and informative. Taste is good. Thanks chef"}
{"text":"The spicy steak noddle is sweet and looks weird with lots of green things on the top. ???????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here several times and the cooks and cashiers are always so nice and helpful. I have several diet restrictions and they are great at recommending different options or customizing meals. Their food is delicious too and they serve pretty big portions."}
{"text":"Was a regular until today-- They turned me away at the counter, giving no explanation except they had a \"bad batch.\" Staff walked away from me before I could ask what that meant. Better call the health department!"}
{"text":"I came here to get a take-out order so I can't speak to much besides the food and the service.  I thought the server did well in terms of getting our order, however, they forgot to put our sides in the take-away bag.  When we called to tell them, they offered to send us coupons to make up for their mistake, but we never received anything.  Very disappointed in the service.  However, the food was fine."}
{"text":"I ordered online for lunch, which is great and super convenient, but they messed up my order. I got back to my office to find that my pad thai had no chicken so I called and got the extra charge refunded but why would I want just noodles?   I ate the just noodles, because lunch, and they were a weird texture. They were tough. I've never had tough noodles before so I'm guessing these were cooked well before my order and just sat waiting to be added to something.   I also got potstickers which probably would have been good there but were just okay after getting them back to my office.  Overall, I probably won't be going back for the same reason I DO NOT go to Nothing But Noodles...they can't seem to get an order right to save their lives. Ridiculous when it's all printed right in front of you.  I would like to note that the girl that got me my order was very nice, though, so that counts for something. I so wish Charlotte had a reliable, good easy noodle place but we don't yet. Good luck to you on your order."}
{"text":"I've really held off on reviewing this place hoping since they were a new location with new staff they would get better. At this point, I don't think it's going to improve, which bums me out since I have loved every other Noodles I have been at!  The building is newer so the fixtures and the atmosphere are great. The staff has always been friendly.  They're in a great location with all the local offices and the high school.  The food quality needs to be improved. Today I found a 7\" hair in my pasta that I ordered to go so it's not like I could take it back to the counter to get a new one. The online ordering tends to be a little bit delayed, but has been improving if you order your pick up before noon. The food tends to be much cooler by the time you get it, which is not consistent with other locations. Also, the online ordering is a gamble on whether or not you'll get your full order, silverware, or if they give you enough dressing your for salads. The other day I ordered soup and got no spoon.  I really hope this place kicks it up a notch since they aren't comparable to the 2 other noodles within 10 miles (Mineral Pt. Rd and University Ave)."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here once when this location opened over the winter and our experience for the most part was pleasant. We went on a week day, early lunch hour before everything got busy.  We decided to stop back in on Saturday at dinner time; having been to plenty of other Noodles locations, we figured this one would be up to holding a busy dinner hour. Unfortunately we were wrong.  The line to order our food was quick and easy; the cashier was very friendly.   It took over 10 minutes to get our food, but when we did my food was room temperature and my husband's was steaming. Not sure if mine was made too early or if I got a dish that was made in error on a prior order. Although my husbands food was hot, it was flavorless. We also didn't get one of our side orders so we had to ask.  I'm unsure if this Noodles location is doing something different, or if this was a change for the whole Noodles franchise, but they no longer give you silverware when they drop off your food. We asked about it and everything is now located by the soda machine... one of the busiest spots in the restaurant. So we hunted for eating utensils, but there were no napkins. So my question is what if you don't order a drink? You'd never know this.   The tables were dirty. It wasn't until we left 30 minutes later that tables were finally being cleaned off, mostly because patrons were asking. Ours was only slightly dirty when we arrived (we got the only table left for 2 people) and thankfully we could just brush off the crumbs.   I don't think we'll be back to this location any time soon given the number of places there are to eat in SP, but I do plan on keeping an eye on Yelp to see if things improve."}
{"text":"I just had to make an account because of how disturbed I am that I just found a penny-sized piece of plastic in my meatball."}
{"text":"The staff may have been in training or newer. The food was a little stale, like the noodles had been re-cooked or something strange was going on with the cooking method. I also had to re order because the person entering orders and taking payments wasn't really paying attention, he was chatting with the rest of the staff behind the counter."}
{"text":"First time ever to this chain.  We intended to eat at George and Son's (very good Chinese food located in same shopping area) but it was too long of a wait.  I had high expectations when I saw all the very enticing photographs of all the noodle dishes they offer.  I opted for a regular size Korean Spicy Beef which looked very good in the pic.  What came out was a 1/3 full bowl of greasy, over-cooked noodles with barely recognizable pieces of gray-looking beef all sprinkled with a load of fresh-looking vegetables, green onions, and cilantro.  The noodles and beef reminded me of something that would come out of a can and lacked any flavor other than the spice that was on it..  I am not very picky eater (especially for a meal under $10 for4 lunch) but I felt compelled to let others know how horrible this food is.  I am not a big fan of Panda Express but there food has this place beat for sure.  You'd be much better off going to Pei Wei if you want a fast and delicious and fresh Asian meal for the same price.   I cannot imagine if the spaghetti and meatballs or other items may be better but I don't think I'll waste my time here again."}
{"text":"I really like Noodles & Company.  It is tough to find fresher food than this.  I have been twice now and ordered vegetarian choices and the veggies were fresh and tasty.  You can see the cooks preparing each meal to order. I can see how this would leave lots of room for error, but both times my meals were great.  My kids get the mac n cheese and it is really yummy.  Yet, I would caution that if you judge your restaurants based upon quantity, this will not be a good choice for you.  The portions are not large.  I left both times feeling like I had eaten just the right amount of food and I am not a real big eater.  If you prefer big meals you will have to spend quite a bit to get full here I would say."}
{"text":"Our office went here for lunch,  all got a variety of their menu items;  pan noodles,  pastas,  salads,  sandwiches,  and soups.   No one was overly excited about their meal,  but no one really grumbled either.   My pad Thai with tofu was okay,  a little dry and could have used more sauce.  The organic tofu were over - seared and blackened."}
{"text":"I just had the Indonesian chicken peanut dish, yummy and fresh!  And Lex the cashier and Carrie the chef could not have been sweeter or more welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Paying a lot of money based on the size of the bowl. The bowl will be filled only halfway...beware. Food was bland. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday lunch with my roomie back when I lived in the city.  They were running a BOGO special last summer, which led us to try the place.  I'm a huge fan of spicy dishes, so I went for the Indonesian Peanut Saute Noodles with the Thai Curry Soup. The soup was nothing special, just a simple, spicy broth with some fresh veggies thrown into it.  I did enjoy my Indonesian Peanut Saute... I wouldn't exactly classify this meal as authentic Asian by any means, but it tastes great from an Americanized point of view.  The portions here lean on the larger side, so come here hungry!"}
{"text":"Staff are so friendly and attentive, great service and delicious food. They really go above and beyond."}
{"text":"Tried it yesterday for this first time! Ordered in the app and picked up. I love the convenience and it tasted really good! Probably going back today."}
{"text":"Nice variety of options. No \"Kids Menu\" but there are just plain noodles and mac'n'cheese big enough to share. Really like the Thai Soup and Thai Hot Pot. It's close to authentic."}
{"text":"Delicious but over priced. The servings are way to small for what they charge but I have liked every thing I have gotten from their so far. I'm sure I will eat their again but I hope they either lower their pricing or give more per serving!"}
{"text":"Seriously worst experience ever. First time here and I ordered online 50 minutes before I set my pick up time. When I get to the pick up register she said my order wasn't ready. I waited for 10 min when my order was finally ready and I realized it was ready because I walked up to the counter they set it on. They never called my name. Asked to speak to the manager where someone comes and says \"what the problem\". Very unprofessional and rude. I said what's the point of placing an order online when it's not ready....she had nothing to say then goes and gets the real manager where he apologizes but does nothing else. Finally leave and when I eat what I order it was disgusting. The noodles were soggy, it wasn't warm...everything about this meal was disgusting. I call to complain and The person who answered said \"my manger is busy sorry he can't come to the phone\". I said well if he can't speak to me I will contact corporate and she said \"ok\". Honestly this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced and the food is mediocre. Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"The Indonesian Peanut Saute is amazing! If you are a first timer or haven't tried it yet I highly recommend it! I like how the calories are posted right on the menu and you can get a delicious meal that won't kill your allotted calories for the day. The coke machine they have there is awesome and I've never seen one like it before. With all of the fast food places that have such unhealthy options this is definitely a welcomed addition to Wexford!"}
{"text":"Got the Japanese noodles. They were really good. Right amount of savory, sweet, and spicy. The portions are huge. And the hospitality of this place gives Chick-fil-A a run for its money !"}
{"text":"Their listing says they're open until 10, so we stopped in Champaign on a road trip with two cranky hungry kids, only to be told they close at 9.   :("}
{"text":"Food just ok got a BOGO coupon in the mail. Tried 2 of the pasta bowls the penne rosa with crusted chicken was the better of the 2. It came out within a reasonable time was warm not hot. The shrimp in the other bowl was a little fishy. Will give them another try (with my other coupon). This is a 4th place restaurant not bad just not good enough."}
{"text":"I tried their Indonesian Peanut Saute with \"steak\" today in the regular size. You order, find a seat, and they'll bring out your bowl to you.   First of all, this is not steak. It looks and tastes like cubes of stewing beef that do not have even a hint of browning on the outside. It is a uniform greyish-brown. Not a good first impression. I wasn't expecting much from these noodles because of the appearance of this \"steak\". Please don't call it steak unless it's actually steak and you're going to cook and treat it like steak. If you're going to treat it like stewing beef or pot roast, call it that. The taste of the \"steak\" was not as good as properly cooked stewed beef and was not even in the same universe as a properly cooked steak. I honestly felt that was $3.59 (or 3.95) wasted.  The noodles? They were pretty good. I've had worse at Thai joints. They had a good peanutty flavour and a great rice noodle texture. There were fresh bean sprouts, sprigs of cilantro, shreds of carrot, and a wedge of lime that all lended a pleasing and necessary freshness to this big bowl of peanut-coated noodles.  I would get the noodles again. I would not get the overpriced \"steak\" again. That's no way to treat beef. Shame on you, Noodles & Company. Stick to the noodles. Leave the steak to The Keg if you can't handle it properly."}
{"text":"This noodles is, of course, like all the other ones, same standard style to the decorating, same food, same everything. There is one thing I would like to touch on about this particular location and that is; its location. It is in a great place near a lot of cool places in Fitchburg. Fitchburg isn't the biggest city in the world but we endure! My favorite thing is that it is right near a Great Dane Pub and it is in the same strip-mall area as a Starbucks so after a little dinner you can go grab a cup of coffee or a beer! The staff at this location are also always so nice and always have a lot of energy, they are quick with bringing food out and very respectful. That is a big part of a place's review, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Every time I go here my order somehow turns out wrong. I order online a lot on my way home from work but I've tried ordering in and it seems like they either put something on my meal I asked for off or vice versa. If they do get it right (has happened once or twice believe it or not) it's very blah... overpriced for not even being able to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"While the food here is generally fairly reliable, the staff is just slow.  And there's no excuse for it because there's plenty of employees.  While I watched my food \"die in the pass\", I had more than enough time to count the 8 or 10 employees that were just standing around not doing much of anything(besides talking with each other).  There were perhaps 2-3 orders active, so they weren't crushed during my post-rush lunch.  It took some restraint not just to go bag my own food, and get out of there in 1/2 the time.  The bankok curry was good, but the portion size was pretty small.  I've also had the stroganoff and it was decent.  The employees lack the sense of urgency required in the food business.  Time is money, people!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty noodle concoctions are served up in decent-sized portions in this apparently national chain.  With most everything available vegetarian, the low prices and friendly service at this little strip-mall establishment made my lunch memorable.  When will Noodles & Company come to California, where I live?"}
{"text":"We had three fine meals here recently and I was happy to see restaurant nice and clean and music was set at a reasonable volume.  Much better than past visit here."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The food was not that good. The Caesar Salad tasted a bit fishy, the spicy beef noodle dish was not that tasty and the dumplings were really flat and the dipping sauce was not good either. I never really liked Noodles and Company ever since I had their pesto dish and that was years ago... I believe when the Noodles and Company first opened on University Ave (I believe) and that was the last time I ate there. I figured I would give them another shot. But... I don't know... the service was average and the food wasn't amazing... I think I should stuck prepackaged sandwiches I saw at the cafe near Kilwins.... I wasn't impressed and I probably won't come back to eat @ Noodles & Company. However... their Snickerdoodle cookies were AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was small and had 0 flavor. If you like over paying for small portions and microwaved meat this is the place to be. Needs more Pad Thai sauce and bigger portions. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I like noodles and company and I enjoy their food. However, I have one major complaint. They focus too much on the noodles and not enough on the vegetables.   Sure it's a pasta/noodle joint, but when I order \"whole grain linguine with balsamic, olive oil, white wine and roasted garlic, red onions, tomato, spinach and parmesan or feta\" I expect to get just that. Out of all the times I've gone, which is about 5, my meals have lacked vegetables. Maybe one or two pieces of tiny broccoli, 3 spinach leaves, or just even a few chunks of tomato. I enjoy the vegetables and they should be present in the dish, but they aren't.   I may be expecting too much since I'm a vegan, don't worry I didn't order cheese, but they list vegan and vegetarian items on their menu so they should be more sensitive to us. This is something this location definitely needs to work on."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect because I had heard a lot of wonderful things about this place. The food is alright. There was nothing really special, but it was new, clean and the portion size was adequate for the price! I've been there twice, but haven't had a desire to eat there again. I guess it really depends on the mood. I can't put my finger on it, but might try again soon."}
{"text":"Our bad expireince started with a grumpy cashier, even for there to be a line of people waiting, she continies to stack cups where there are already plenty of to get us all in line a drink. Then there was no silverware up stairs and barley any down stairs, if there was any, it wasn't clean. I'm not sure how dirty silverware could make it out onto the floor for people to use, either way, disgusting. The food was not fresh for us like other noodles and company have provided for us as well, our plates came out with the cheese not even able to melt, while others get steaming fresh bowls."}
{"text":"This is by far, one the worst noodles and company in the Madison area. Ordered the Napa Market Salad with grilled chicken, salad came without chicken... that was weird. The staff doesn't pick up the dishes to open up tables so I was watching customers clean of tables and moved bowls to smaller tables so they could sit with their group at a larger table.  Sat there and ate entire salad and the bowls were still on that same table and the customers were putting their dirty bowls at the one table to make space for other customers. That was quite the show... the salad wasn't as good as I remembered. This place could use a few pointers from the Fitchburg location. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Im from Indiana and so happy we got one out here in Tempe. My favorite dish has to be the Mac & cheese with pork. The pork has a peppery taste that goes great with the creamy cheese. My friend alwAys gets the Indonesian peanut sauté with chicken. It's good but spicy.    I love the fact you can have the noodles American, Italian, and Asian styles. If you get a regular size make sure to get double meat.   The store and bathrooms are clean and service is fast. Have fun."}
{"text":"Lunch break wasted...  I tried to save time by ordering my food online and pay in the store. I dont come here that often anymore...see previous reviews. But I wanted my free Mac and cheese. The cashier kept leaving me to help another employee every time I tried to pay. When I did pay, she had issues scanning my app for my rewards. I checked my food and no free mac and cheese day. When I asked about my Mac and cheese she said it was too late because I paid. She asked the manager and he said your order didn't qualify. Sorry. Very non chalant and rude. I asked him for his name and he replied Taylor. I see why I don't patron here much anymore..."}
{"text":"We ordered steak stroganoff and Japanese pan noodles with marinated steak both where excellent. Staff was friendly. Food came out within minutes. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"I just had their spicy chipotle adobo dish and I thought that it was delicious. The sauce was creamy and had a nice kick to it. On the dish there was a sprig of cilantro, some sour cream, cooked red onions, mushrooms, and a tiny slice of lime. I would have liked there to be a larger slice of lime and maybe something else added to the dish to give it a brightness. Possibly, if they had more cilantro on there, that would have added a lighter dimension to the otherwise heavy cream-based dish.   Their spicy korean beef noodles had a strong teriyaki flavor. I would have liked the noodles to be more firm, but since they were ramen noodles, people probably expect the noodles to be as soft as they were. There was some uncooked spinach in the dish along with a couple springs of cilantro.  I had one of their thai sweet chili chilled noodle salads, which was one of their featured dishes a while back, but I wasn't a fan, even in the middle of the summer. The sauce was a bit weak on this dish. This dish doesn't seem to be offered anymore as I didn't find it on their menu today."}
{"text":"Noodles and Company is an okay place for lunch, and by okay I mean not that great. It's located on campus, which makes it an easy destination for lunch. They serve Asian-style noodles, Italian pasta, and American pasta (think: macaroni and cheese etc). They also have soups and salads. You get to pick your size (regular or small), and can add ingredients (such as meat) if you like. I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes: they were alright but really not too impressive. I wouldn't mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper."}
{"text":"I ordered Korean Meatballs, Chicken Noodle Soup, and Pad Thai with Tofu.  This was my first time ordering Korean meatballs at the suggestion of a friend. They were excellent despite said friend saying that they seemed a little burnt. (I did not think so/it did not take away from the quality of this item) I highly suggest this item.  The Pad Thai left much to be desired. It was dry (I needed a glass of water to swallow it) and it missed the mark in terms of being flavorful. I loved how heavy handed they were with the sprouts but I was not a fan of the burnt-ish tofu. This burnt flavor took away from the quality of this product.   The soup was pretty bomb. My sole complaint is with the protein portioning; there were only a few measly pieces of chicken on top. Beyond that, nothing. The flavor was so on point, however, that I was able to overlook the lack of chicken.   All in all, not bad. I do believe if I'd ordered during a different time of the day (midday vs dinner) that my order would have been of better quality. The defects were preventable and it seemed like they kinda crapped this order out--therefore the 3 stars."}
{"text":"We visited last night, and I was not impressed.  We ran into a complication, and had to order food for the family on a weeknight, which I never do.  I didn't want fast food, so we decided to give Noodles & Company a try.  We ordered five different dishes--from Japanese to Italian to American--and waited in the restaurant for our takeout.  First of all, the price was astronomical.  $45 for noodles and a very little bit of meat!  We all know how cheap pasta is.  I was floored that we were spending nearly $50 on takeout noodles.  Our order took about 20 minutes to complete, which I am okay with as long as it is made fresh--and correctly.  When we got home, we discovered neither was true.  We ordered meat on every dish...  two dishes came without.  We ordered the regular sized dishes, however one dish came in the smaller size.  That ticked me off.  The bill was already an issue for me, so for them to leave off the meat and downsize a dish size--both of which cost us extra--is unacceptable.  We were already 20 minutes away, and my kids were starving, so we couldn't go back and fix the problem.  The food was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the price, and it didn't taste fresh.  To be fair, there was a lot of it.  We had leftovers, but no one was really thrilled with the prospect of eating it on another day.  We won't be back.  There are lots of other better options in the area, and this wasn't a good enough experience to make our regulars list."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice. The staff members are super friendly and nice. Much better than your downtown location. The Napa Market Salad is really good and I think I'll come here often just for the salad! I'm not a huge fan of the noodle dishes and the Thai Curry soup was not good... but some people like it. The place is pretty clean and busy around lunch time. The Caesar salad was also pretty good. I will definitely be back! The only thing that sucks is the parking.... not a lot of space for the traffic that comes through."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Just discovered it when my Mom was in town & she turned me on to their Pad Thai noodles! Everyone is super friendly, all food is good & customizable. Best part is ordering on line & having your food actually ready when you get there. Reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Good food, slightly rude employees. I was kicked out of their bathroom during business hours because an employee could not wait an extra two minutes to clean it. Very unprofessional and the food was not good enough to justify the treatment."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price. Not the best atmosphere. But overall, not a bad choice for a casual meal."}
{"text":"spicy Korean beef, I taste not.  while residing in los angeles for more than 15 years, living in korea town, 10 minutes from thai town, 15 minutes from china town and little Tokyo. hardly any beef in spicy Korean beef and the taste was bland. asked for and received money back. will I be back , not to soon, will give TOP MANAGEMENT time to get their ____  together.   with the help of yelp hopefully we can improve the dinning experience on the west side. remember it starts from the top down, we all know which way ____ flows. am I right, you bet ya."}
{"text":"First time at this chain.  The reason I give 1 star is we had to change the flatware thrice cause they were not washed properly after previous use!!!!!! The staff was so casual about the dirty flatware!!! Tomato basic bisque and Pesto cavatape was food but  Japanese pan noodles was not hot/warm and noodles were rubbery."}
{"text":"They have good noodle dishes, the price is just a bit high. I prefer Lulu's Noodles on Craig street (better food and prices and more choices). Gets really crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled that we finally got a location in the Phoenix area. These are all over the midwest and is such a great fast casual concept. My favorite is their mac and cheese with the parmesan encrusted chicken breast. They also have great salads if you are looking for something a bit lighter!"}
{"text":"This restaurant literally smells like cat piss...... and they gave me an amazing huge portion of chicken it was almost a half an ounce literally four little bitty pieces of chicken the size of the end of my finger when I asked the lady if that's normal she said yes and would I like to purchase another I told her no I would just never be back she shrugged your shoulders and walked off many of you know me and you know that I will never ever he back it saddens me because I like this place I just thought it would be a better experience and as far as I'm concerned noodles you can go screw yourself i'm proud to say it's been three years and I have kept my promise I'm just glad Facebook reminded me to put it here on yelp"}
{"text":"So this was my first experience with them not too sure what to think they're on the pricey side for small portions the flavors are okay which we had the Korean noodles and the chicken salad Korean beef sorry was lacking something not sure what it was maybe more spice or some kind of seasoning chicken salad was playing chicken salad kinda expensive for a little tiny Bowl we'll try it again maybe was just what we had service is very good though that was a plus I'll give them another chance just because of that"}
{"text":"My experience was disastrous. My roommate and I were looking for a fast, filling meal before a night out. This was not the place to be tonight. We ordered Pad Thai and Korean Beef Noodles to-go and patiently waited until crap hit the fan. After standing around for what we considered a long time for a to-go order, my roommate went up to the counter (which was unattended) and said we'd been waiting 20 minutes. The employee looked back at the screen and corrected her saying it was only 15 minutes. After that off-putting interaction, we proceeded to wait 15 more minutes. In the mean time, three other customers came up to complain.   Basic customer service skills lacked, and the place was entirely understaffed and disheveled from a busy day. The only redeeming qualities were the large portions and the nice employee that let us each take a free dessert as an apology.   P.S. - They forgot the sauce on the Pad Thai, making it just noodles sans company."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with their pad thai, it was more meh than anything. But then again, I really wasn't expecting anything authentic from Noodles & Company when it comes to Asian fare. I got the shrimp pad thai and there was some chicken in it--good for me, bad if I was a vegetarian.   I dig that they offer two sizes of noodle  bowls to get and you can get protein added into your noodles but it's the same price across the board ($2.25 I believe) but  I would think it would be cheaper for tofu then steak. Super friendly employees with a quick turn around. I ordered my noodles to go, got a soda, sat down for a minute and bam-noodles were ready."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to fast food.... Low prices and quick, and the meals are wholesome... Not a bad place to go for somewhere quick to eat.... Nothing special.... Just a cheap, decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Gotta love Noodles.  The pesto is better than I've had at most restaurants- it doesn't taste like basil puree and is used just enough.  It's some of the the only mac that feels like it's actually covered in cheese.  The Japanese pan noodles are thick and spicy.  I really haven't had anything here that I disliked, and it's fast and cheap."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we are passing through. Great alternative to fast food when we are on the road. We've had fantastic service and the food is fresh and hot. Good value for money. Mac and cheese and spaghetti are big hits with my daughter and we've tried a bunch of the other dishes."}
{"text":"The food was meh. Overpriced for just \"meh\" food. Felt shitty afterwards. Never going back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I ordered the same as the first time: Steak Straganoff. I cannot express how delicious the pasta was, so butter and yummm. The steak was cooked just right as well, except for maybe a little too much salt but that's okay. My friend got the Pesto Cavatappi and she said that it might just be the best pasta she's ever had.   This rating lacks one star because of the temperature of the food. When it was served, it was luke warm and on the colder side which led to cold pasta in a few minutes. It felt like it was sitting out for a while before it was served to us. Other than that, I'm definitely showing up here for lunch soon :D"}
{"text":"Came to eat here with some friends who work an hour north of Madison. Everything that you normally expect from a Noodles and Company.  Would give 5 stars, but we asked at the checkout if I could have the salad dressing on the side, and they put it in the salad."}
{"text":"Noodles & Co offers quick service and reasonably priced, competently prepared noodle dishes. Good option for someone who wants a meal of decent quality with not enough time or money for a casual restaurant (unless you're craving Asian noodles, but more on that later).  The noodles taste fairly fresh and are all cooked to a nice al dente, a rarity in Oakland's mass of mushy noodles. The Italian and American offerings are all fairly satisfying, albeit lackluster. The dishes don't knock you away with bold, exciting flavors, but it's decent comfort food.  Steer clear of the Asian noodle plates. Seriously. Not only is this section of the menu awkward, but a quick stroll to similarly priced Taiwan Cafe, Szechuan Express, Burma Tokyo, or Spice Island Tea House will get you far superior Asian noodles (be they Thai, Indonesian, Chinese, or what have you)."}
{"text":"Could the noodles be any more hard and gummy, and could there be any less sauce?  I have tried several different dishes here hoping my dissatisfaction was with one particular dish.  No such luck.  It's all bad."}
{"text":"Always great food. Ordered online once and there was a mistake which caused me to have to wait about 15. The manager on duty gave me 3 free meal cards. Everyone is so friendly!! I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Tried it because I liked the concept - casual international food, at very reasonable prices.   I had a small penne pasta $5.35 with Thai soup add on for $1.50. Lunch under $8 is pretty awesome, one hopes.   The best part was that the noodles in the soup, and the pasta were both nicely cooked al dente. The good ends there.   The penne sauce was pretty bad. No rich tomatoey flavour as it should have, and it was kind of sour (it tastes like there's alcohol in the sauce that isn't cooked off). The along with the bad sauce there is raw tomatoes, spinach, and mushrooms in the pasta. The Thai soup was better but under whelming. Just a plain watery Coconut curry soup with noodles and more raw spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes.   I don't recommend and wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"First time to this place which is recommended by my friend. Ordered to go. Nice and fast. Didn't understand why the review is so bad. The Japanese udon with pork is good- I like the pork very much"}
{"text":"The Wisconsin Mac n cheese with grilled chicken on top and sriracha!!!    I crave it! Sooooo yummy!   I like to take my gram to noodles- she gets the beef stroganoff and loves it! It's her fave! (It's delicious but I'm allergic to mushrooms so I can't eat it.)  All of their dishes are great- their pad Thai isn't my fave but you have to go somewhere more authentic for that anyways!"}
{"text":"I love Noodles and Company and I was terribly excited when I saw they were opening only their second location in all of AZ right across from my home. The Penne Rosa with chicken is my go to and I've never had any complaints about the food. The place is always clean and the staff seems friendly enough, however some of them seem to walk around with their heads up their you-know-what. This could be attributed to experience and the fact that they have only been open for about a month, instinct would have me believe the servers would improve over time.   My experience last night was probably the first time I've had any complaints as I ordered my go to meal (penne rosa with chicken) and was disappointed when my meal came out with no chicken. I asked for this to be fixed and was given the option of having the whole meal remade or some chicken brought out for me to add. I would recommend having the whole meal remade, unfortunately, as the chicken that came out was overcooked and dry and would have probably been better when mixed together with the sauces in the pasta. I also had to ask twice for my chicken (that I paid for) and was given minor attitude when asking the second time after I had watched it sit on the \"done\" line while all the servers walked past it. I shouldn't have to beg for something I paid for.   All in all, I still love Noodles and Company and won't hold a few incompetent workers to less than a five star review."}
{"text":"I had driven past this restaurant a number of times and finally had the time to do so today.  As soon as I walked in a super friendly man greeted me and explained the menu. I was impressed. I decided to get the Indonesian Peanut Saute to go and was not impressed.  Perhaps it was just my choice but there was little nappa and red cabbage one piece of red. Too many Asian Sprouts which overtook the taste of the dish, 3 small pieces of broccoli which is I was really looking forward to eat since I'm a broccoli fan. Tasted like something I'd buy buy in frozen food section and microwaved.  Just not worth the price i paid. Not sure if I'll be back. Store and bathrooms exceptionally clean. Nice appearance."}
{"text":"I went here with an open mind and I really wanted to like this place. I ordered the Bangkok Curry with Sauteed Shrimp. It came to my table really dry and flavorless. I went back and asked for extra curry, the lady was real nice and brought a small dish to my table. It made it taste better I guess, but by then my food was cold. Not a big fan, probably will not go back."}
{"text":"A good place to have a quick bite. The cost vs quantity is good. The portions are quite filling. The spread isn't very great , but it's adequate .  The staff are very sweet and curteous .  Highly recommend if you are in market square."}
{"text":"I just love this place the food is fantastic and affordable the penny rosa is amazing with shrimp it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! There were a bunch of choices on the menu and in a variety of sizes - small, large and side. Small portion was plenty for me. Prices were great too. Food came out quickly and staff was very, very friendly.   We had the Wisconsin Mac and cheese, the stroganoff, kids grilled chicken and garlic bread. The Mac and cheese was delicious. Cheese sauce it was in was good; real cheese topping was amazing. Stroganoff was also good as was the garlic bread and marinara sauce it came with.   Only complaint was the chicken. I wouldn't add it to any meal or order the kids chicken again. It's not exactly grilled. It looked microwaved and was rubbery. Even though my son was starving, he didn't want to eat it. :("}
{"text":"We were in Madison on a cycling tour for a week.  We ate here four times because it's fast, delicious and reasonably priced.  They also are very flexible to make your meal any way you want it.    We had the pad thai, spaghetti and meatballs, teriyaki bowl - all were really good.  The people are really friendly also.  They have two sizes and for $1, you can add a side salad.  My husband and I ate for under $20 each time.  Such a deal."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for lunch and this was my first time at a Noodles and Co. We won a lunch as a group and Ian was very helpful and we got to sample lots of their food. Everything I tried was very good and all of the staff seemed to be friendly and will to do anything to help out. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I used to appreciate chains because I can always go expecting a reliable meal, and thought I knew what to expect here. But this particular store needs work.  Was forced to eat here twice in one day by friends who love the drink machine (really? just syrup dropped into your typical drinks that make it taste even more artificial, but to each his own...). Got pan noodles - soggy, overly seasoned noodles. It was so salty I couldn't finish it. Had chicken noodle to go with it, and it came lukewarm and tasted strangely heavy in one spice that I couldn't identify.   Got penne rosa (my other usual staple here) and it was bland that time! The tomato bisque was okay though, but again was lukewarm for some reason. I would assume soups are made in bulk and spooned out as they're ordered, so are they simply not kept in proper containers?   I know not every noodles and co is bad, but there seems to be a lack of standardization. I don't think I'll be coming to this particular one anymore. Will simply go elsewhere next time in Oakland."}
{"text":"You can call ahead for your order. My go-to is the meatless med salad with no olives. So good and the dressing is my favorite."}
{"text":"I tried Nothing But Noodles a couple of weeks ago and was very impressed, so I decided to try this new addition to Dilworth.    The cashier was extremely helpful as I approached the register to order.  She went over how the restaurant works, how to order, the sizes of the dishes, and suggested the Trio to get a sampling of various menu items if I couldn't decide.  With the Trio, you get soup or salad, a small entree, and a protein.  It sounded good, so I asked for the Trio with Bangkok Curry with chicken and some curry soup to make it a complete Thai meal.  She then informed me that that soup wasn't included, but I could get tomato or chicken noodle.  Hmmm... with curry?  Methinks not.  Too many different sauces and flavors.  I opted for the Caesar salad instead.  I found a hightop table down the narrow part of their L-shaped dining room, pulled out my book, and waited for my meal to be brought out to me.  It was brought in just a few minutes.  I was surprised by the size of each dish.  Yes, I saw the size of the plates when I ordered, but I didn't picture that just a dollop of noodles would be in the 6\" dish.  The piece of chicken was bigger than the noodles on which it rested.  I ate the entree along with my spoonful of Caesar salad and was still a bit hungry.  It was lunch, though, and I had already spent $8 (without a drink), so I figured I'd just wait until it cycled through my system and hoped it would fill me more as time passed.   Next time I'd skip the Trio and just get a regular size noodle bowl.  I think you'd get more for your money.    Unfortunately, Noodles & Company didn't measure up noodle for noodle for me.  The size of the entree was a bit disappointing (it's noodles!) and maybe I was spoiled by the modern look and decor of my previous visit to Nothing But Noodles, because Noodles & Company didn't have that same atmosphere.  Add to that the stylings of James Taylor and other easy listening hits from the 70s piping in from the speakers and you've got a restaurant that your parents might enjoy."}
{"text":"What happened to this place???  They used to have the best mac and cheese....  Now it's just a bland disaster.  I added steak to it.  Of course the price for the portion is less than stellar.  My boyfriend really loves the Alfredo MontAmore with Parmesan chicken.  At least it's got some flavor.  While the garlic bread is pretty good, it does cost a pretty penny.    The service is friendly and prompt.  I ordered online and my food was ready to go and as-ordered when I arrived about 10 minutes later.  I'm not sure the food is really worth the price, overall.  We'll stick to coming here on an as-needed and as-craving basis..... Which, unfortunately, is not very often."}
{"text":"Good and fast place for noodles. Comes here often for a quick dish/bowl of noodles. I like the variety of ways and sizes  you can have your meals served. I'm fan of spicy food and the Indonesia Peanut Saute is one of my favorites. If you are consensus of your caloric intake, all meals lists the calories with and without potein, which is a plus. When dining in, the staff brings your food and cleans up when you done. :-)"}
{"text":"1st time here.  Others have told me not soo good.  Now I know why. 27.00 for 2 small bowls of noodles, a side of Soup and a side of meatballs.  Noodles where cold, chewy with meat that was grizzled with fat.  With noodles in their main name, you would think they would strive to get that part right.  This was last choice as our first 2 choices to eat today.. Right across the street both other choices had a 40 min wait to be seated.  Now I know why this place was empty.  Needless to say.. I won't be back.  On a side note. The unsweetened tea was good. That's the reason for 1 star."}
{"text":"What can I say - Noodles and Company is always a favorite. It is a great go-to place that I know I can always count on for a good meal. They have great variety for a VERY affordable price. I can't believe I can get a nicely portioned delicious meal for only $5. I highly recommend the Pesto Cavatappi and the Mushroom Stroganoff (although now they've replaced it with a steak stroganoff, but they can still make the mushroom one if you ask).  A downside of this particular location is the parking. It shares a very tiny parking lot with Starbucks and there are no close spots to the building. Often times the parking lot fills up and you have to park out on the street, which is a bit inconvenient."}
{"text":"Noodles never blows me away, but it does the trick when called upon :) Usually go with the pasta fresca w/chicken or the Mushroom Stroganoff w/beef (if I worked out that day)...ha. Both are good. The restaurant inside has ample seating, but the best feature is their outdoor sitting area. Nice place in walking distance for the Southend folks looking for a good, fast meal."}
{"text":"I loved Noodles and Company.  I like the concept of everyone ordering their own choice of food with different combinations of meat.  Service is fast, they bring food to the table.  Place is filled with students (but not loud), but then what do you expect in Urbana with University feeding all businesses in the area. There were 5 in our group and we tried: Penne Rosa, Pesto Cavatappi, Indonesian Peanut Saute, Pasta Fresca with Pork and Whole grain Tuscan Linguine.  Except for Penne Rosa, everything was very good. Small bowl is perfect size for one adult.  Regular can be shared. Service is fast and food is filling.  What more do you want at this price :)"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place here in Pickering and we decided to try it out today.  The staff was very friendly and helpful since it was our first time there and told us about the various options and dishes.  I got the Indonesian peanut noodles with shrimp and my husband got the beef stroganoff and we tried each other's dish.  Mine was quite tasty and pretty spicy and I enjoyed it very much.  The stroganoff was also delicious and creamy with lots of mushrooms and beef.  My biggest complaint was that two of the soda options were not working so I couldn't get Coke Zero which was what I preferred.  We would definitely go back to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"decided to check this out as its minutes away from my office.   what I like: - when you dine in, they serve you like you're at a restaurant  - good portion  - decent level of flavour   what I didn't like: - a small is WAY too small, it's an appetizer  - they rush you to order  - they're far from a food court so there isn't always a spot to sit"}
{"text":"I actually really like this Noodles, despite what the other reviews say. They're usually really consistent. I have tried the Mac and Cheese, Pesto Cavatappi, Penne Rosa, Japanese Pan Noodles, Med Salad, and Tofu. I usually get the Penne Rosa. The flavors are always really good. I usually get it to go after work. I am only giving them 4 stars because I have had a few more negative experiences, but they only happened once: -Forgotten side salad in take out order -Not enough cheese in Mac and Cheese -Given a small instead of regular size dish -No silverware in takeout bag"}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup was beyond greasy. Could've been delicious but I could actually feel the grease on my lips after a spoonful."}
{"text":"Not what it is  back home. Came all the way from Goodyear, AZ. I had to tell the staff what was missing from my food."}
{"text":"I do like Noodles and Company but this one is not the same. It lacks something and I thought that is was just a bad trip there. Well is was not just a bad one time. I went again for lunch. Place my order, got my drink and waited for the food. I be nice if they would give you your entire order without asking for it. So when I was leaving I asked if they would finish letting me have my entire order? If was good thing that I kept my receipt because the cashier wanted to kept it. Now I know why. Next time I want to go to Noodles and Company I will travel the extra miles to the one on 28 Ave and the 101 for better service."}
{"text":"This place was OK.  I don't think I would frequent here.  They have different noodles for different taste buds (from beef stroganoff to Asian style) but they don't do it great.  It all just tastes OK.  My toddler is not very picky when it comes to mac n cheese but he didn't like the way it was made here.  It looked like the mac just had some cheese melted on top so I don't blame the little dude.  I gave it 3 stars because my daughter liked her noodles a lot.  I think it was buttered pasta (she's the picky eater in the family).  I had the Japanese pan noodle upon suggestion but it was too spicy for my taste buds (not big on spicy foods).  You guys probably want to mention that when you suggest to someone a spicy dish.  It tasted good ... but I just had to drink a lot of water (i'm a wimp).   The decor inside is nice.  Booth tables are always a plus in our house because my toddler stands when he eats.  All in all, I'd try this place again because the flavor was definitely there.  I just didn't want to drink half a gallon of water with my meal!"}
{"text":"First time in this location, second time overall.  I love noodles, even thought this is nothing comparing to Chinese good, it's still very tasty.  I had the regular Spaghetti & Meatballs, the portion wasn't all that big as it came in an even bigger bowl, it's about half full.  The noodles cooked just right, but the meatballs are a tad bit salty, I think it came with 5 meatballs.  They serve Coke products.  My meal came close to $9.  Not really sure if it's really worth the price to go again.  Maybe I'll give it a try again in a year or so."}
{"text":"Meh. Honestly that's all I can say about it. The portions could be bigger, and a tad bit overpriced. I've tried most of the dishes on the menu, and finally conclude that the two things worth getting are the Truffle Mac and the Pesto Cavatappi. The other things just aren't that great. They've really dumbed down on the flavor even though their noodles come from a variety of different cuisines, almost seems too manufactured of a taste. There's no \"soul\" in this food. Obviously, it's just a quick eats fast food place and I really shouldn't be expecting too much. The atmosphere is very wonderful too. But who knows, I'd still prefer if it was more flavorful and probably bigger portions as I believe that had in the past."}
{"text":"I use to come to this place for a quick lunch or dinner. I just stopped in for the first time in almost 5 years and wow has this place gone downhill. There was no ice in either of the soda machines, while the machines themselves looked like they haven't been wiped off in months. The soda tastes kinda funny so I ended up just doing without the drink. The entire restaurant looked like it needed a really good cleaning. When my dish came to me, it was cold and kind of dry as if it had been sitting at the window for a while. And there were fruit flies/gnats flying around my food the entire time I ate. This place is not well-managed. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I am definitely not a fan of chains, but Noodles & Co (and Zoe's Kitchen) fill that nice low-priced, reliable food void.  I had tried Nothing but Noodles which was a horrible experience so I was worried about trying Noodles & Co.   Much to my delight, Noodles & Co was MUCH better and much friendlier. I have now been here several times because of its convenient location in SouthEnd,  The service has been at 100% over the top friendly/helpful every time. I almost always order off the \"asian\" third of the menu while the Stud orders off the Italian third.  I actually have to say my fave is the Asian chopped salad with tofu. Yum. I like that you can order anything vegetarian. They also give you the option of a \"small\" or regular size which is nice.   Bottom line: If you want something quick, friendly and won't break the bank, this is your place. If you are seeking to push your culinary horizon, probably not the right place for you. And they have a kickass giant rice krispy treat and cookies!    Tip: make sure to drop your card in the free lunch bowl. Good odds."}
{"text":"For lunch I had the Mac n cheese with marinated steak. It was awesome, so awesome that I would have preferred more steak and less macaroni. The Mac seemed to be used to fill you up."}
{"text":"Love this place! So many options for entrees, little nibbles, add-ons, etc. Fast service, huge patio, Mediterranean Sea salt grinders, and a magic soda machine (the kind with hundreds of options). On top of all that it's super affordable. I would come here twice a week if I lived closer."}
{"text":"A new-ish addition to Tempe Marketplace! I'm a huge fan of pasta / noodles so Noodles and Company seemed right up my alley. Unfortunately, after eating I thought it was just okay.  I went in with my boyfriend & we each got the Japanese Pan Noodles bowl, mine was with grilled chicken & his was with marinated steak. The regular size comes with quite a bit of food, I was only about to eat about three-fourths of mine. The sauce that the noodles were sautéed in was quite a bit different than I've had at other places. I think it would have tasted really good, however there was so much pepper on the chicken that it took away from any flavor that the noodles had.  My boyfriend ate his food first, then tried some of mine and noted that it was almost like we got completely different items even though we had ordered the same thing. I hadn't tried any of his, but he said that the marinated steak wasn't at all peppery like the chicken and went really well with the noodles. He definitely liked his version better.  When they were bringing food out to patrons I saw various appetizers which looked good. The menu was very surprising as they offer the Asian noodles but also Mac & Cheese? I'd say that if you're in the area then give this place a try. I wouldn't recommend driving out of your way to eat here, however."}
{"text":"really love the mac n' cheese with meatballs. almost too rich, but the texture of the (pork?) meat provides a nice contrast to the pasta & cheese. portion size is fine for any normal sized society. only gets (a somewhat inflated) 2 stars cause i'd rather just say no to their 'asian' dishes than be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was spot on. I was taking my food to go and they got my order right along with a place setting. So no eating with my fingers this time; which is a nice change.  I use to always get the mac and cheese with extra cheese an extra meat. It was my one guilty....really guilty pleasure in my stop over here. For some reason it just was not hitting the spot with me. It use to hae this really creamy cheese sauce that went with it and of course topped with shredded cheese.   I got back to my hotel, putting the bag of yum on the floor board with the heat blasted to make sure my yum stayed warm and gooey....but then...I get back to my room open up the lit to start the hunt for my goo...where was it!!!!! Frankly it was nowhere to be found. That is right, it is as if they boiled some elbow macaroni slapped it in a bowl, threw some meat and cheese on the top and called it a day.  So disappointing that I skipped my mac an cheese and moved on to the rice krispy hunk that I got; which was hard as a rock. Very disappointing. The good news is it kept me from wracking up an insane amount of calories because frankly it just was not worth it."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but they were shattered upon my first bite. I came in for lunch, staff was very friendly, and the place shares the same format of fast casual chains like Panera and Chipotle. I ordered the pad Thai and it almost had no taste. The noodles were also overlooked and just kind of fell apart. I also ordered pot stickers, which were just about the worst I've ever had. Apparently the sandwiches are the real ticket here, but I find that odd for a place called Noodles & Company. Anyway, it was clean and the staff was nice. But I won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage! From the food to the service there is nothing good about this place. It amazes me there is more then one location, but like all diseases they can spread...."}
{"text":"Super convenient.  The fiancé was sick and needed some soup.  Got her Thai and chicken noodle.  She said both very good.  Very fast service just did pick up."}
{"text":"This review is for the chain in general. I will post it here as this is probably the Noodles I have been to the most. I have been to all the Noodles locations in town at least five times and to Noodles in general about 60-80 times over ten years or so.  Consistently fresh and tasty food. Good service. Fast. Easy to customize the pasta (and add lots of veggie). Good value unless you add too many extras. Great pasta. Nice restaurants. Many have outside seating.   They are a little stingy with veggies that you pay extra for. The extra meat could be cooked better into the meal instead of just lying on top. menu does not change too much so if you go too much you can Noodled out.   Deserves a 4.5 stars (yelp, gives half stars would make giving fair ratings  easier), but is a little closer to 4 than 5."}
{"text":"Decent curry soup. Tofu was great."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of why you shouldn't try to be a jack-of-all-trades. Everything is mediocre at best...  Beef Stroganoff- tiny amount of sauce, strange-tasting meat, the end result being a lump of overcooked eggnoodles with some sauce at its core  Spicy Pork Adobo - has a tiny bit of kick but what's the point without any salt? No flavor, especially the pork  Spicy Korean Beef Noodles - they are in fact, spicy.   Wisconsin Mac & Cheese with Meatballs - this was the most edible item Defintely hits that creamy craving but could really use a sharp pop of cheddar or something. The meatballs were frozen and spongey.   Korean BBQ Meatballs with Gochujang sauce - the same meatballs from the mac & cheese with the same sauce from the Spicy Korean noodles. The sauce made them edible"}
{"text":"Noodles & Company, I love their entire menu over all... however, just this very one Noodles & Co. on State Street always over cooks my Penna Rosa and gives me a pinch ful of feta cheese.... hm. Anyhoo, Noodles & Company is one of my favorite fast foods, very warm food and inexpensive and you get served asap."}
{"text":"I love Noodles & Company, and fact being this one is only a few miles away from my home when I drive back from work - I always call in for a pick up. My penna rosa is the best from here."}
{"text":"I love the Mac n cheese with grilled chicken. Get it every time. This location has two levels. Unfortunately I didn't sit upstairs today. That'll have to wait another day since I have to eat quick and go to work.   There is a good amount of tables to choose from so that is great. It does get busy during lunch so good luck finding a good seat."}
{"text":"My family and I went there this past weekend and three of us ordered the same dish, except my husband and I added meat to our noodles. Within an hour of eating it my husband started to feel horrible and later that night I started to as well. Needless to say we ended up getting good poisoning. I will most likely never go to this location again and if I ever did, I would not get their meat."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! I think the portion size is good. My favorite dish is the Thai curry shrimp. Fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for quite awhile. If you love noodles, then this is the place for you! You can get noodles made in multiple global cuisines! Also, they have the virtual soda machine (I love this type of stuff)! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Super average service and food (3/5 for both). Absolutely nothing wrong with any of the food we got, and staff were cordial. Just nothing to blow you out of the water.  FOOD: 3/5. We got a pesto cavatappi with natural pork (not quite sure what \"natural\" means exactly), a BBQ pork mac and cheese, and an order of cheesy garlic bread. First of all, servings are massive, so definitely order a small if you have an average appetite. The large could be shared, easily. We got one small and one large, and wished that we both got smalls. The pesto was good - I would give it a 4/5. It had enough sauce but wasn't overpowering, and the pork went well with it. The mac and cheese had very little BBQ sauce on it, and my husband was disappointed that they gave us dry pork with a tiny bit of BBQ sauce on top. The cheesy garlic bread was pretty good, but overpriced for the small portions.  SERVICE: 3/5. We came on a Saturday night, and it was crazy busy. The line to order food wasn't very long, but there wasn't nearly enough seating, and the restaurant was very loud and crowded. Also, the line for the Coke Freestyle was 3-5 people long at any given time, the whole time we were there. The tables were all pretty dirty, as people were snatching them up before they had time to be properly cleaned, since seating was so scarce. The kitchen forgot the pork on our pesto dish, but they brought some out when I mentioned it, so it wasn't a big deal.  Overall, a decent experience. If I were hungry and rushed in an airport or on a business trip somewhere and happened to see a Noodles, I might stop. Other than that, we won't be back. There are just too many other good places out there!"}
{"text":"This was place pretty tasty! My husband LOVED everything about it, the penne was a little to dry and undercooked for me, but I was able to add some extra sauce and it was really tasty! We also got the garlic bread, so yummy! And my husband had the mac n'cheese with pork. He's a picky eater, so seeing him enjoy it was really good!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  My wife raved about the location downtown so I had to try this location when I saw it. Your food options are apps, soups, salads, sandwiches and pastas.   You walk up to the counter, place your order. You pick what type of pasta dish you want and add whatever meat your want if desired. Pay and get your drinks from the pop dispenser. They have one of the new cool ones with 100's of pop combinations to choose from. Have a seat and wait for your food to be brought to you. It comes out fast!  We started off with the Cheesy Garlic Bread as a appetizer. (Parmesan and garlic butter melted over toasted ciabatta break with Italian seasonings and marinara sauce. Available in 3 or 6 slices.) So good!    I had the Truffle Mac & Cheese and added steak. It features cheese sauce with white truffle oil, sautéed baby portabella mushrooms and topped with parmesan cheese and toasted breadcrumbs.   Our daughter had the Steak Stroganoff. It features marinated steak, mushroom sherry cream sauce, fresh herbs, cracked pepper, sautéed mushrooms, egg noodles and parmesan cheese.  And the wife had the Penne Rosa with chicken. It features spicy tomato cream sauce, penne pasta, mushrooms, tomato, spinach and wine, parmesan cheese.  I also got The Med Salad with chicken (Romaine, mixed greens, tomato, cucumbers, red onion, olives, cavatappi pasta, spicy yogurt dressing and feta cheese) to go for lunch the next day and it was delicious as well!  They also offer wine to complement your meal as well. It can be expensive for a family ($30+) but, the food is so good!"}
{"text":"No matter what noodly concoction you want from whatever part of the world, this place has something and it's tasty, quick and with a lot of personality. The drink dispenser is pretty neat too."}
{"text":"This is a newer noodles and company. The staff was super friendly and helpful and checked on us a bunch to make sure we were doing ok while we were eating. The food came out quick and tasted good. Would definitely stop in if you want noodle dishes with quick and friendly service! Its the same as all other noodles and company menu wise."}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ pork Mac & cheese. It lacked cheese, and BBQ. So I paid $9 for buttered noodles and dry pork. Pathetic. I actually gave the rest to my dog, and to my surprise even she didn't finish it. So that's alarming. I obviously do not recommend this noodles & co location."}
{"text":"Had the Napa Market Salad with Chicken.  It was excellent.  Nice crunch and favors.  The tomato soup was good as well"}
{"text":"I had the Korean Beef noodles and loved them! My favorite thing about the dish was the sauce and worst part about the dish was the beef. Everything was amazing except for the beef. It had more of the American beef feel to it than Korean beef. Over all opinion though, very very yummy!"}
{"text":"Last year when I got on Facebook i saw that there was a special opening event at Noodles to come in and try a totally free meal.  I signed my family up and we had a really good experience! The menu has a decent variety of italian, asian, american and random items.  Everything is very fresh and tasty! Non tip servers are jolly to deliver it to your table.  OH! and the coke machine is to die for ! a new contemporary design with TONS of flavors for each dasani, coke, sprite and tons more!! One night i tried the rice kripsy and it was so good! the girl said they're home made every day !! I wish there was a little more to the menu tho, but nonetheless its an awesome place with excellent prices."}
{"text":"I do not think there is anything exquisite about this place. I just come here at random times when I'm craving non-authentic pasta, which is rare. I always get their spaghetti and meatballs which is decent, but again, nothing spectacular!"}
{"text":"Place was just ok. No ice in machine and nobody willing to refill it for me. Crap all over the floors and dirty tables. Food was not great and probably will not come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Noodles & Co. My fiancé and I have been going to the location at Tempe Marketplace for awhile until he took a trip to Men's Warehouse for his outfit for our wedding and saw that Noodles & Co. was COMING SOON! I was stoked to hear that news because the Ray & I-10 location is much closer to home! The service here is friendlier than the Tempe Marketplace location! I haven't tried anything other than the Penne Rosa which is AMAZERFUL!!! So thank you Noodles & Co. for your existence! I'd give you more than 5 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch on the go if you live noodles and making your own noodle creation. Service is pretty good we've gotten solid service every time no matter how we order from them."}
{"text":"Simply about the worst two bowls of noodles we ever experienced. The noodles were dry and the flavor sauce tasted burnt and dry. Never again!"}
{"text":"eOn my first visit I tried the Japanese pan noodles with shrimp and made it a triple combo with a small bowl of the thai curry soup.    The thai curry soup was actually quite delicious with pieces of spinach, mushrooms and carrots but the noodles were a little undercooked making them hard and almost unpalatable.  The pan noodle in the small portion is quite small and the sauce was good (super salty!!) but but the noodles were on the dry side.  The shrimp were a little gross, they weren't fresh and had the weird taste that cheap frozen shrimp have.  There were about 6 small shrimp in the dish.   On my second visit I ordered the pad thai and was completely disappointed.  There were barely any pieces of egg and what was in the dish were dried precooked pieces of egg that were thrown in when the dish was assembled.    This place is unique in that it offers many different types of pasta and noodle dishes but it is far from authentic when it comes to the Asian choices from what I've tried so far.  The novelty of this place has caught Oakand's attention as this place is constantly busy and always has a line during peak times.  It is convenient and relatively fast and the prices are on par with the panera across the street.  But I highly recommend that Pitt students and others take their money to the numerous small businesses in Oakland.  Noodles & Company is a chain that tries to grasp authenticity but never quite makes it there.  I suggest Lulu's noodles on Craig street for pad thai, their scrambled eggs for the pad thai are made to order and not scant in quantity like in N&C's meager and almost pitiful dish.    I looked on their website and they do offer a free meal to people who sign up for their email list on their birthday, I signed up as my birthday is in a few days.  I find that I will probably frequent this place more than I honestly wish to.  I gave this chain three stars for the convenience, speed and overall package of this place; at least its not another mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Why can't they get orders right? Consistently, and repeatedly, I have placed orders (both in person and online) and asked that certain ingredients be omitted.  These requests show up on the screens that the food preparers use, as well as the receipt on my bag when I get the food.  I'd say at least 1/2 the time, my order is wrong. I have had my chicken ommitted, which I didn't know until I was back in my office), and ingredients left on that I specifically requested be left off.  If you don't want to allow customization, fine, say that.  Thankfully, these were not ingredients that I am allergic to, just dislike.  Also, they often burn food.  I had pad thai today (sprouts left on when I asked for them to be left off - the receipt clearly says it), and my eggs were charred.  Burnt eggs are gross.  Word to the wise: check your to-go order before leaving, even if it is a pain to do.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Nothing special,  but the staff was really really nice.  I'm not sure I would pay that price again for a little macaroni,  but it was cheesy."}
{"text":"I needed to share my experience with Larry.  I approached his register and began to place my order. I immediately got a sense of how my interaction with go with him when he stopped me.   He asked me if it was I was with a group.  I was with a very large group, but I was ordering on my own.  Again, he asked me if I was with the lady that was behind me. I did not know her and again, clearly I was ordering on my own.  This in itself was not a big deal, but it was downhill from there. I gave him my order and he asked a question.   I have poor hearing,  especially in a loud environment, andI had to ask him to repeat himself a couple times. He was extremely irritated by this.    I asked him what kids crispy was. Irritated, he said a kid size crispy.  I asked him what a crispy was. Crispy chicken? Crispy bread stick?  I had no idea. Acting as if I'm the stupidest person in the world, he points to a rice crispy treat. Instead of just telling me. I accidentally pulled my credit card out too early and he made a big deal out of it and said \"Now we're going to  have to do this all over again!\" I thought we were going to have to actually do the entire order over. He only had a press a couple buttons.  As I was eating my dinner, I saw him get after an employee. Super poor taste to get after employees in front of customers, but I also saw how hard she was working. I felt so bad for her.  As we are about to leave, he marches up to me and says accusingly, \"The rice crispy treat your daughter got was a super giant one.  We ran out of kid size ones.\"  Um, okay?  She had already eaten it.  Did he want me to pay for it?   I had asked for two crispys. for our two sides. I thought maybe they gave us a large one instead of two small ones.  I only saw from afar what she got. She was at a different table.  I very seldom leave feedback for negative customer service. But his chauvinistic and officious manner has been bothering me all day. There was absolutely no sense of customer service, simply of establishing dominance.  Edit:  I edited my stars on this review from 1 to 3 because I was contacted by the regional management.  He apologized and sent me a voucher. I really appreciate when companies take responsibility."}
{"text":"If you want to waste $8 for poor quality food (by poor quality I mean you can get better from the local grocery store frozen food aisle) plain noodles with no seasoning and maybe a quarter of an egg. The size of a regular is what a small should be. Less than half the container had noodles. They refused a refund because they do not guarantee quality."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and for \"quick food\" joint it isn't so bad! (Especially when option is noodles or Five Guys...)  I really like that noodles & co. Has the calorie count clearly labeled on the menu and offer each dish in two sizes. I've ordered both the pasta rosa and Bangkok curry, two of the lower calorie options, and have enjoyed both. Both times I have been here I didn't have to pay for my meal which sways my opinion a bit. I always think these types of places are overpriced for what it is and noodles is no different.  The staff at this particular location are extremely friendly and efficient. Both times I have been here for lunch were busy but lines moved and dishes were brought out quickly.  I usually do not like chains and would have never gone here on my own if I hadn't been in groups. All things aside, noodles is one of the few lunch chains I will oblige to going to and have yet to have a poor meal."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place numerous times and now I regret never stopping in! I got the Japanese Pan Noodles and it was amazing. Fresh ingredients, perfect temp and loaded with flavor. Potstickers are good too. The staff was attentive and very friendly. Highly recommend this location.   It's national noodle day and I won a few things. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese with tofu to go.  The service was a little slow but the mac and cheese was so delicious, exactly what I was hungry for, definitely hits the spot if you are craving mac and cheese."}
{"text":"First visit during their first week of operation. The restaurant is located in the central core of the Tempe Marketplace, sort of in the south-east corner, near the  Harkin's Theater complex. Plenty of parking, easy walk to the front door, the restaurant is near the parking area, near Jimmy John's.  The menu is large, so be sure to decide what to order before you go. The 'regular' size bowls are rather large, so are the portions. The small soup bowls are very small, like elementary school size.  Keep in mind, the place is called 'Noodles' any entree you order, the primary ingredient will be pasta, not the meat toppings. We tried the Steak Stroganoff and the Alfredo MontAmore. On both dishes, the sauces and meats were sparse but excellent. We'd both order them again. These are not sugary.  Two others in our group also ordered the Wisconsin Cheesesteak and BBQ Pork sandwiches. Both come from the kitchen much much smaller than the photos online. The meat for the Cheeststeak was the same as the Steak Stroganoff. My friend with the Cheesesteak said he'd never order one again. It was juicy and tender but kind of boring.   The BBQ Pork was topped with coleslaw. The BBQ Pork Sub was described as bland, should probably be re-named Coleslaw Sub with traces of pork.  Both sandwiches came with sides, both got Tomato Basil, both liked that soup but said it was not worth going out to eat.  Process: You order at the counter, sit at a table inside or outside with a numbered sign waiting for food to be delivered to the table. For carry out (you can order online or by phone) stay near the register and listen for your name to get called. With four meals, my time from turning off the Loop 101 to returning to the Loop 101 was about half an hour.  If you are a sugary food fan, like a person who thinks Panda Express is the best, you will probably not like Noodles & Company.   If you get carry-out be mindful of soups in bowls potentially leaking, after you get to the car make sure they're sitting upright in the bag.  Summary: sandwiches were disappointing but noodle based entrees were filling and well made. This is not a fast food restaurant, it's more like a fast-casual restaurant. This is the first Noodles store in Arizona."}
{"text":"So, I ate here last week with my two young picky sons.  They both enjoyed their food immensely.  I tried to go healthy and did not love my Buff Bowl with steak...at all.  It wasn't for me.  But I liked their buttery noodles and Tucson Bowl.  I went thru my receipts today and saw the opportunity to complete a survey of my experience and was rewarded with a BOGO offer on any bowl.    We got Penne Rosa and Tuscan Fresca with chicken and Feta.  Sooooo tasty. I am a fan.  I ordered online.  Food was ready for picky up and service was friendly.  My only complaint...this will make it difficult to avoid carbs.  But they do have the buff bowls for those more serious about that than me.  Thanks.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place, but not really my favorite. I've been here a couple times and none of the meals have really \"wowed\" me..."}
{"text":"I have dined at many Noodles & Co.  this location has been very good and consistent.  I like being able to mix it up a bit, without having to entirely create your own dish.  They have a good system to provide a broad base of flavors.  The cookies are awesome."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that one of the reasons poor Noodles is only getting two stars from me is because of the hype.  I heard SO many good things about Noodles & Company from several different people that had eaten at their locations across the country, so I was really looking forward to a yummy, carb-loaded meal.  Unfortunately, the product definitely did not live up to the hype.  I ordered bacon cheeseburger mac and cheese (my mouth waters just by typing out those words).  I had visions of hot, creamy cheese sauce with moist hamburger and hunks of bacon dancing in my head.  Much to my dismay, the actual product was quite \"chain-y\".  To start, the whole dish came out room temperature.  The cheese sauce appeared to be white American and was just mehhh.  On top was a dry combination of hamburger meat, bacon (bits?), shredded cheddar, green onions, and diced tomatoes.  The tomatoes were the best part; it gave the dish some much needed acidic freshness.  I won't lie, I ate the entire thing.  But much like the cheese sauce, the entire dish was just very mehhhhh.  Something else too:  Despite the fact that they advertise as such, they don't have beer.  Yet?  I know the restaurant is relatively new and they may be waiting on a liquor license and such, but if you say you have beer both on your storefront AND on your menu, you better have a sign up alerting us to otherwise.  It was quite the \"wah wah wah wahhhhh\" moment.    But thankfully, my sadness from lack of beer was alleviated by their super fun pop machine!  Talk about high-tech good times.  They have one large machine and it's a touch screen.  Your main screen gives you your basic choices for pop, and then once you choice your brand it goes to ANOTHER screen that gives you all these additional options for flavor!  Did anyone else realize that Coke products come in nearly a dozen different flavors???  I mean, this was my first time here so I'm not sure if ALL of the options have that many flavor choices, but talk about a good time!  So my thoughts overall are:  If you need a meal on the quick side (30 minutes or less) and you don't want greasy fast food or Subway, than this is a totally acceptable destination.  It's quick (during non-peak hours), it's filling, and it does have a decent selection.  But otherwise, venture out somewhere else.  There are a dozen different places to eat just within Market Square itself!  Take your sit-down business elsewhere and leave this option for when you're in a time crunch."}
{"text":"I got the pad thai.  For five bucks anywhere else in California, I could have gotten a much bigger and better pad thai with chicken.  But in Madison, I got a decent serving size of vegetarian pad thai, sans tofu.  It tasted like pad thai, but the pan should have been cleaned better beforehand. Tasted of like burnt oil residue. Good amount of fresh bean sprouts and peanuts.  The noodles were a little too chewy, but I ended up liking that.  The noodles also could have been cut a bit before-- they were too long to fork through like an adult.  The setting is a little noisy, but service is good for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here while passing thru while out of town. Good service, and the fare I've come to expect from Noodles locations."}
{"text":"Glad I paid a $1.50 for brown avocado. After I threw it off I ate the salad. Decent salad, tad too salty. This is my second time at this location and the first time I got Mac n cheese with Parmesan crusted chicken, and the coating on the chicken tasted like it was stale. My review is based off 2 separate trips to this location. I've never had this happen at other locations. Won't return here."}
{"text":"Oh dear goodness don't get me started on this place. Unsanitary conditions (see pictures.) There appeared to be a hair of some sort on my penne rosa. If you can't guess what \"sort\" I'll give you a small hint. PUBIC! Yuck! I am disgusted by that alone. Second thing - no email address to complain to. I would normally email the location to address my complaints, but this time, I'm taking it to the public. (It's not like me to immediately Yelp my issue rather than resolve it). On top of that, staff is not very attentive. Please don't go to this location. Take the five-minute drive to Mineral Point Road. After all, what would you rather do? Take a slightly longer drive - or eat a pube?"}
{"text":"Not bad food. The cashier should not be wrapping silverware...then going to touch cash...then back to silverware..."}
{"text":"okay so i was ordering and forgot to ask for no mushrooms, so i apologized and asked if he could ask to remove them befor i had even paid. This guy had brown hair and a beard and he rolled his eyes and glared at me and mumbled under his breath \"fucking ridiculous\" When my food came, i had ordered a large and the contents of the bowl were much less then all of my friends larges. My experience here was the worst experience ive ever had. Customer service is number 1 in any buisness and its ridiculous that he could not achieve this."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and the food is super tasty! Best Mac n Cheese I've had in a long time, and the Thai chicken soup is amazing! Will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch in the city. It has a great location, great selection, great staff, great food. Even during the lunch rush, this is still the place to go in the city. I enjoy it every single time that I go."}
{"text":"I got the spinach and fresh fruit salad and it was drenched on balsamic dressing. I normally love balsamic but this was barely edible. I added grilled chicken and it was cold. Not appetizing at all."}
{"text":"The penne rosa with Parmesan chicken is my favorite dish. I also love the tomato and cucumber salad. The staff has been very friendly at every visit. We love sitting outside during the warmer months."}
{"text":"Meh. The staff were a bit rude and didn't seemed interested in answering basic questions about their menu items. We sat at a table and the person who brought out our food didn't even bring us utensils. The Japanese pan noodles were super dry with barely any sauce and the chicken in the Alfredo dish seemed like it was microwaved. Would not come back."}
{"text":"There are usually a lot of employees there but most of them are just standing around.  Only the cashier and one person cooking are actually working so the orders take a long time to be done. The last time I was there I mobile ordered but rather than having it sitting at the pick up area, it was behind the counter so I had to wait until the employee felt like acknowledging me before I got my order. When I asked about the delay the manager lied to me and told me the order just came up.  I saw the bag sitting there when I walked up. When I got home and opened the bag, there was no dressing. I couldn't believe I paid $8.50 for a dry Caesar salad.  I'll never make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Our first time here tonight.  The food was okay at most. You can probably buy frozen food that taste better. The prices that we were charged was not worth it. We ordered the \"big\" bowls, which hardly had anything in it. We left, still hungry. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very nice modern decor and clean. The food portions are great and the food was wonderful. Had the pesto with pork. The meatballs are delocious. I will return"}
{"text":"Great and helpful staff at this location! I have always loved Noodles & Co! Good variety made quickly with fresh ingredients! Perfect bowl sizes. A great place to go if you want something quick but not too fast-foody and your friends all want something different pasta wise."}
{"text":"I'm bummed because I've been wanting to try this place and it turned out to be disappointing. The Japanese pan noodles I had was a small portion and the flavors didn't jive well. My wife felt the same about the pad thai. The only saving Grace was the mac and cheese, which my daughter really enjoyed."}
{"text":"This Noodles and Company is nicely decorated, clean and centrally located with a lot of parking available.   The menus are very easy to read.  The food is tasty.   The Korean beef and pad Thai were very spicy and just the way I like it.  Employees there were generally happy and helpful.  But life is comparisons.  Compared to other noodle places I've been, this one has some major flaws that should be visited.    The one drink machine is inadequate.  People do not want to wait on a long line to get a fountain drink.  When I went, the person in front of me complained that the cherry coke was empty.  This could be rectified if management put their collective heads together.   The portions on the hot dishes were small.  Some of my colleagues remarked the same thing.  They are used to larger portions and other noodle houses (check out Tempe) give much larger portions.  The salads seemed like a much better value but also were very dense with lettuce, so they appeared larger!  The value is not there. For a few dollars more I could get waited on instead of waiting in line.  It shouldn't cost $12 for a lunch consisting of a small bowl of noodles and a drink that I had to stand in line to order.  As one of my kid's favorite places, I will return, but when I do I hope I'll find another soda machine at least!"}
{"text":"My first thought: OMG, I love noodles!  I can't wait to try this place! My afterthought: Blech.  My husband and I stopped by when Noodles & Co. opened up.  I ordered Pad Thai with shrimp... not sure what he had.  As far as my dinner went, everything was bad, especially the shrimp.  When shrimp tastes and smells like fish, you know you're in trouble.  I tried avoiding the shrimp at that point.  I can comfortably say that it was the worst Pad Thai that I've ever had.  The portion size was small - though in hindsight that was probably better, because I wouldn't have finished a larger size.  The tastes and textures were just off-putting.  I've even made Pad Thai from a box that was leaps and bounds ahead of this dish.  Everything tastes like fast food, and I guess that's the point sort of.  It's the convenience factor, which is why I gave Noodles & Co. 2 stars instead of 1.  The servers were also pleasant enough, and the place felt clean.  I may go back to try another dish, but I certainly won't be rushing there anytime soon."}
{"text":"This location of Noodles & Company opened not very long ago. The food is great, reasonably priced and so far, the staff is super friendly. The other day, my husband and I forgot to pick up our rice krispie bar and one of the staff was happy to bring one back to our table, no questions asked. Staff always walks by to ask how everything is going.     They have one of the soda machines that makes 100 combinations of drinks (but it does slow things down a bit when there are 4 or 5 people in line to make drink choices)    There seems to be plenty of seating and you can also order ahead from their app, I believe. The restaurant is clean and the service is quick. I have been there twice in the last two weeks It is one of my favorite places for a salad and the tomato bisque soup. Their Mac and cheese bowl is a very good size portion. I'd rather come here for it than Mac's.    It is located close to a lot of other shopping options like Target, Splurge and the Oilerie, so it is a great place to stop at before or after a shopping spree. If you answer a simple survey after your visit, you may receive a code for a free shareable-like pot-stickers-of considerable value too!"}
{"text":"I really love to discover a perfect little local restaurant since that seems to be where you find really fresh food and great flavor.  So I was surprised to find Noodles and Co., a national chain restaurant, that is both fresh food and great flavor.   Every time I go I have a difficult time decided which menu to order from but I have to say that the Japanese Pan Noodles and the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese are my favorites.  Add the juicy, breaded Parmesan chicken to the mac and cheese and you won't be able to stop eating.  The food is delivered straight to your table by the person that cooks the food.  The customer service here is wonderful for a fast food place.  They go beyond what I would expect at a fast food restaurant, coming out to our table to make sure we have what we need and that our food is delish.  A couple of times when we've visited other Noodles and Co. shops the manager comes out to visit with us personally.  They are very kid-friendly and I really appreciate that in a restaurant.  The friendliness of all of the people working here is so consistent as is the food.  I love it.  I can't say enough good about Noodles and Co!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this is still a good place to eat but I've been here a number of times and it's not always very clean. The food is good but every time I've gone, there are a number of uncleaned tables and food all over the floor. I'd recommend ordering online and taking it home instead."}
{"text":"Relatively bland, but not terrible. For the price and way the food is, I don't intend to eat here again."}
{"text":"Today I tried Noodles & Company for the first time. It was honestly really good and especially for the price. I got the Pasta Pesto Cavatappi. The small was about $4 something and the regular was $5-6 something. The prices for salads were about $8 and the sandwiches were about $6. The food tasted good and the small size was a good size for me. Not too small and not big enough to bring home. I would highly recommend this place to other people and I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Food was flavorful but I think I will visit on a slower day.  Food took a long time to arrive and when it did, it was luke warm."}
{"text":"I had the Japanese Pan noodles they were really good I just feel like it is a little overpriced"}
{"text":"I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign weeks ago and was rather excited since I am a carb-oholic by nature and anytime you say noodles my ears perk up and my salivary glands kick into gear.  Needless to say I have been waiting (anxiously) to try this place for a while and after reading all the reviews I was certainly looking forward.  Now that I have taken my last sip and chewed my last bite ... all I can say is MEH.  Let me start with the positives and then move on to the part that quickly turned what could have been a four or five star review into a \"I'll give you two stars this time and I hope you impress me next time\" review.  I walked in at 12:45pm and the place was packed, the line actually was out the door by about 4 people, which is considerable regarding it was late for lunch time (sorta).  Upon getting to the register there was no acknowledgement of it possibly being my first time, when I clearly had the deer in front of headlights look, but the gentleman who took my order was super nice and didn't rush me.  I ordered the Penne Rosa, with Parmessan Chicken, and a soft drink.  After taxes I think I paid $10.50 or so.  So service was fast, it was friendly, and it wasn't horribly expensive.  They do have a super fun touchscreen pop machine...but they were out of Coke Zero **heart break**  So why was it meh?  I was afraid the \"fast food\" aspect would dilute the flavor and that it did.  For the first time in my life I ate something that was both spicy and bland.  I didn't know if to reach for the glass of water or for the salt shaker.  I opted for the Diet Coke and called it even.  I did take it to-go so maybe that had something to do with it ... but for something to pack that much of a spicy punch (lips tingled but not quite beads of sweat) and still be like \"where's the actual flavor\" is rather unacceptable.  I do want to return.  And I want to actually do a sit-down meal instead of to-go.  Perhaps trying a different genre of dish or simply eating it fresh as opposed to after a cross-town trek will make for a better taste.  I do love pasta, so I'm not ready to write this place off.  Maybe next time it'll impress as much as I thought it would...heck, even if it just impresses period I'll take it."}
{"text":"I had a great first experience at this location on the pre-opening and the coming back a second time. The staff was very friendly, the food had great flavor and depth. Also, download their mobile App and get a free bowl!"}
{"text":"This place has really turned it around. We originally came when they opened & the food was terrible. Today I ordered the Japanese pan fried noodles with shrimp & was really happy with the portion size & taste. I have a high food quality bar & thought this was very good. I like you can sub whatever vegetables you want if you don't like the dish as presented. The other good thing (and I get this is silly), but they have the new Coke machine with multiple Pop options. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Consistency is key at these chain restaurants. This location always has quick and friendly staff. They keep it clean and well stocked. Noodles are great. Especially love the spaghetti and meatballs and the alfredo monteamore. They have an awesome spice mix they can add if you like it ."}
{"text":"I go to this location fairly often as it is close to my office. I usually get Japanese Pan Noodles or Pesto Cavatappi. Both are prepared fresh and quite tasty. The quality of food is much higher than I expected from a fast food, chain pasta restaurant.   I am always greeted with a smile and patience as I browse the menu and inevitably order the usual. Also, a small size is plenty for me. It's a tad pricier than I like to spend on a weekday lunch meal...but always worth it.   If you decide to try Noodles & Company, make sure you grab a rice crispy treat for dessert. I always take one back to my office...MMM. They are to die for.  Extra positive - the restrooms are always spotless.  I love going into a public restroom that smells and looks clean."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time. They offer SO makes takes on noodle dishes. I ordered one of their salads...it was fantastic and still featured pasta. The food came out very quickly as well."}
{"text":"My wife had seen this place and had wanted to give it a try.  We went one saturday in between games at the nearby park with the kids.  We got the Wisconsin Mac n Cheese, a santa fe salad, and spaghetti and meatballs for the kids.  The mac n cheese was just ok.  I've had better at other places around this area.  The salad was pretty good.  The spaghetti and meatballs the kids shared was bland, the meatballs tasted frozen, and lacked any real taste.  It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again.  The prices are pretty high for a bowl of noodles which lack flavor.  You'd think if you specialize in noodles you're mac n cheese would at least be memorable."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out - never heard of the chain before. We thought it was a decent place to dine. It was clean, well decorated, the food was delicious and the prices were fair. If you are really hungry you definitely want to get the large sized bowl.  We would recommend this restaurant and location to friends and family."}
{"text":"Yum! I really like Noodles & Company, which while not the cheapest stop for food is still pretty reasonable in my experience.   I remember when this location first opened so I have to say, seeing the evolution of the shop has been kind of cool. The general layout hasn't changed - this location has that cozy college campus feel to it - but what has changed is the menu and displays. I remember when I first came here the only options were noodle soups and, well, noodles! Now you can find salads and sandwiches, and even better for those of us watching our waistlines, there's calorie measurements next to the entree listings.  The soups are all delicious, the veggie sandwiches are also quite simply wonderful, and the noodle dishes I've had have been tasty enough considering that what I'm ordering isn't as expensive as the pasta dishes at my favorite Italian places. For a chain store the food is much better than you might expect and it's never disappointed me when I've needed a filling, affordable and quick meal.   Not a fan of the \"make your own soda\" machine, I think those things are pretty disgusting. But otherwise this is a pretty reasonable quick stop for food in Oakland - the downtown location is good, too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you're jonesing for some noodles, head to Noodles & Company. This business is basically what it sounds like: it's a chain that specializes in serving multiple styles of noodle-based dishes. It has everything from spaghetti to pesto to plain old buttered noodles with meatballs. It also serves a couple soups as well and it looks like they're expanding and may be offering more sandwiches soon, too.  So yeah, if you like noodles and carbs, Noodles is the place to hit for a quick bite. It's not the fanciest food ever, but really, for what it is - a quick and relatively cheap lunch or dinner - it's just fine. Every time I've been here or any of its other locations, my friends and I have not been disappointed. The servers I've run into have always been nice and quick to correct any problems I've had with my meal.  Personally, I think this location may be my favorite. Out of all of the locations for this chain I've visited, this one (downtown) is the best; it's the biggest and has the most seating, it felt the most welcoming, and I wonder if the menu and drink options are a bit more varied than the ones at smaller places. It's been a while since I visited the alternate locations so I won't say this is a definitive, but at the very least, the downtown location gives the sense that it has more options, and that's a positive whether it's a feeling or a fact.  It does seem to have its off-days given the state of the other reviews, but hopefully you can catch the place on a good day!"}
{"text":"I come here alot and love the food but it is a nasty place otherwise. The men's room is always disgusting... sticky floors, trash overflowing, etc. Tables are never cleaned off and piled with trash and dirty dishes. Flooring is covered in debris, trash and food. Surprising since the service is actually pretty good. Employees are friendly but stand around when it is slow. Your food doesn't take to long to arrive and is very good. They have something for everyone."}
{"text":"First time going. Heard great things but sadly didn't live up to the hype. Rubbery shrimp and only the top noodles had sauce. Sadly...won't be returning."}
{"text":"Hidden vegan item bursting with flavor that even the most zealous carnivore could endure: Whole Grain Tuscan Linguine sans cream topped with tofu. Giggity.   If you've not had the pleasure of sinking your chompers into their Ride Krispy Treat, you're not living life to the fullest. I'm convinced the generous wedge of ooey gooey marshmallowy goodness is straight out of an angelic bake sale recipe book. I don't want the secret - I just want them to never stop - ever."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Noodles, it just sounded really good. Our first time we went and saw it in South Hills Village we turned away thinking it was a food court.  But, we went back and I am so glad that we did. My family ordered our meals and sat down in the dining area, our food was served to us. The service was great, very friendly and nice person. The food was just amazing, I am so glad that we went back. We forgot to tell them that my youngest doesn't like cheese and they took it back and remade it for us at no charge. I wasn't expecting that (we forgot to tell them, not their fault).  I am looking forward to going back and trying something new. I had the Steak Stroganoff and it was full of flavor and very filling. My wife ordered a new menu item, Thai Hot Pot and she really enjoyed that. She said it had a bite with some of the peppers in it and loved it.  My daughters ordered buttered noodles and mac and cheese.   Give them a try and I am sure you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I really don't know why people are writing bad reviews. This place is very good and priced just right! I have tried almost everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Top 3 are penne rosa, stroganoff and the spicy Korean but everything else I've tried has be delicious as well! Add chicken to everything... their chicken is amazing specially their Parmesan chicken it's amazing. The pasta Fresca is very light if you want to go for something lighter and very good as well! Stroganoff is probably the most heavy of the ones I've tried. Service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of a restaurant that tries to be everything to everyone.  This is an example where Italian meets far East, and makes it passable.  No real flavor to speak of but everyone has a choice."}
{"text":"The food was quite good - I hot beef stroganoff, which was tastey and hot. The attentiveness of the staff was excellent."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, an upscale, trendy resteraunt that is family friendly, yet makes parents feel just as treated as their children. I was welcomed and served an inexpensive, yet nicely sized portion of food while my daughter had a kids meal. Everyone was friendly and inviting from the cashiers to the as servers. The atmosphere is casual. The eating area was very clean and spacious for a small resteraunt. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because, even though it had a variety of choice, it didn't have as many choices of food I would have liked. But I defiantly plan to be back."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today, and it was REALLY good. I ordered the Pad Thai with grilled chicken, and it definitely did not disappoint. I got a regular size which was more than enough food. The noodles were well cooked, and the chicken wasn't greasy at all which is always a plus. I will definitely come back. The staff was really helpful and nice as well."}
{"text":"I love coming Here! Always get all the mac and cheese. But this time, my mac and cheese wasn't as cheesy so I was disappointed. Wish it was consistent."}
{"text":"Well, there was a ENORMOUS fly and it was kinda getting on my nerves.  Would not recommend coming here unless you want flies"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and ever time it seems pretty consistent. Our food usually doesn't take long and the people at the counter are nice and effective. Place is clean and the food tastes fine, nothing special but nothing terrible about it either."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The food was delicious but the service was not so much. Both times my order was messed up. My first experience here, they forgot about my order and then rushed my order once it was brought to their attention. I was frustrated because I waited a while and then when I got my food, it wasn't correct. They charge extra if you add protein. I paid extra for chicken and I didn't get chicken on my order. I got my food to go, so I wasn't aware until I got home. I have this place a second time and they forgot the chicken. Does this place not like to put chicken on their food?"}
{"text":"Great alternative to regular fast food near U of I campus.   Before an Illinois football game, the beer and burger places were overflowing. The fast food chains did not look appealing. But this little spot, with a huge selection, plenty of seating, and fast service, filled the bill perfectly.   I can't give it four stars because the food was uneventful. I had the Indonesian peanut saute with grilled chicken. The rice noodles were decent, the sprouts and peanuts were fine, the seasoning was nice and spicy, and it came quick and warm. My wife had the tomato basil bisque off their Mediterranean menu. She said it was like eating spaghetti sauce without the spaghetti.   Not a destination, but a good lunch alternative."}
{"text":"Was always hesitate to try Noddles & Co. So glad we did. Tried the Japanese pan noddles (added steak), delicious! Even though mine was a little dried, was still delicious. My wife got the better bowl because hers was not dried like mine. Next time will try the spicy Korean beef noddles."}
{"text":"Ordered the Whole Grain Tuscan Fresca with grilled chicken and feta cheese. Flavor was light but it was yummy. Good sized portion too. My friend got the pesto cavatappi with chicken but it was a little bland. Not bad to try out but probably won't come back. Paid 1.50 for a huge Rice Krispie treat too, probably what I liked best :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened up. It was something different for the area and the dishes were flavorful with a good amount of sauce, had a lot of veggies in them, and the meats were decent. Over time, the quality has continued to go downhill. We've gotten take out from this location a good bit, so I've had a lot of experience in this decline. The portions are still good but the sauces are now extremely skimped on and there's barely any veggies in them. I swear that the only difference between a small and a regular size is the amount of pasta. It doesn't seem like there is much of any extra sauce or veggies in the regular than the small. And at a buck fifty PER VEGGIE to add more, that's such a rip off. The pork is still good, but there's a fifty fifty chance that the parmesan chicken will be burned. This has happened to me on several occasions. On this most recent order, my pasta was undercooked. Undercooked pasta, on top of a lack of sauce, combined with almost no veggies equaled a poor experience. I will give them credit that the parmesan chicken wasn't burned this time, though."}
{"text":"I have had orders slightly messed up in the past, but this place deserves more credit. Once I placed a to-go order the staff jumped right on it and had it ready in 5 minutes, eventually the food needed to be remade due to them forgetting I requested onions but even the remake was under 5 minutes. Glad to see the staff is full of team players. I recommend this restaurant and don't see many flaws compared to other take-out options. I'll be happily returning in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm from Germany and made a little stop here. The pasta tasted so good and there were really a variety of menus. It is really a very nice restaurant.  I'd like to have this in Germany .  Thank you for this great meal ."}
{"text":"I've been here for 20 minutes and 13 of 18 tables sit un-bussed and dirty giving customers nowhere to sit. The few customers that have some in have to sit with dirty dishes and wipe there own table. Unacceptable and disgusting. Plenty of employees, but apparently it is kit anyone's job to bus tables. And FYI, this is a regular occurrence at this location. Will it revisit this location..."}
{"text":"Pretty good considering it's on PATH. Food was tasty.  It can get pricy if you add meat though."}
{"text":"Passing through and needed something quick to eat. The counter person was meh about the whole ordering experience and kept having issues with the register. Looked like he was so out of it, maybe he needed some coffee to put the pep in his step to at least say \"HI\".   The food came out fast and hot. Tasted ok. It's actually expensive for what you get. I ordered the Japanese pan noodles with tofu and only got 2 pieces of broccoli. Is there a broccoli shortage? Shiitake mushrooms? Forget about it. I got 2 thinly sliced pieces. Carrots? Maybe 5 sticks. Cilantro you say? Must be a shortage for this too. There is no shortage for noodles though. Tofu amount was standard, but I think it's because you're paying $2.39 for it.  The person who brought my carry out bag from the kitchen was so pleasant and happy it was great. Such a contrast to the sleeping counter person. There was a little line and so many workers and only 1 cashier...who was sleeping on his feet. No one jumped on to help him out. I really miss the West side location, they were on top of it."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they finally decided to open up a diner where noodles is the speciality. I thought I'd try this place out for lunch one day, and I was impressed. The customer service was outstanding, and I was pleased to hear that they had gluten free noodles as an option. I wasn't too impressed with the portion size- I think it should have came with a little bit more noodles and salad for $9. Other than that, the quality was great. I think I'll try this place out again soon."}
{"text":"I have orderes the Japanese noodle, a bit salty for me. Only a few veges. Noodles are fine."}
{"text":"The great thing about Noodles & Company is that no matter which one you go to, it's always consistently good. The portions are a little small for my eating habits, but I'm  pretty sure they're the size we should be eating.   The qualities having now been listed, I need to point out that, while the regular bowl is listed as $5.25, once you add protein ($2.25), a small drink, and tax, the meal costs over $10 - certainly not an economical lunch option."}
{"text":"I know other people have had some less-than-pleasant things to say about this location, but it is my absolute favorite N&C location in the Madison area. First, the staff is uber-friendly, helpful, and smiley. Every time I go, at least one of the staff members talks to me at my table to make sure I'm enjoying my meal.  Second, this location puts lots of sauce on their dishes, so I've never had a flavorless meal here. If you know anything about me, you'll know I love sauce (see the tagline on my profile). I'm especially a fan of the Indonesian Peanut Saute with Tofu and the Penne Rosa with Shrimp.  Third, this location is very convenient for me - right along University so is between my home and downtown."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Good food and a good variety of choices. Fast service and well worth the price. Even took some home."}
{"text":"They develop good flavors for the different kinds of cuisines they offer here. The prices are also good and the decor is modern and petite. The only issue I had was that the noodles in my order were pretty dry and there was not enough sauce to stir it evenly. But if you're hungry and can't decide what kind of food to eat, stop here because they have a variety!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed.  It is more worth it to go to an ethnic place know for good noodles than an American place trying to make several style noodles.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place, but they miss the mark in several ways.  The good: Portions are a nice size, the kids enjoyed the dishes they chose and the Thai Hot Pot was deeelish  The bad: Some noodle dishes were bland, like the Indonesian Peanut dish. Some dishes were also over-priced. Who would get Pad Thai here when it's the same price at the Thai House? Biggest offense, though was that there's not a kids menu. You're told to just get your kid a small bowl, which is still ~$6. Add onto that a drink and a side of bread.... My family of 5 walked out $44 poorer and we all got water.  Bottom Line: Some good things on the menu, but leave the kids at home and don't be surprised if you're supplementing your dish with Siracha"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this location. Roll  that was ordered and paid for was missing. Feta cheese was missing from the med salad. Contacted the store (Allie) and was told they would send a gift card. Not received. Sent a note on web site. Still no gift card. Will not order take out from them again."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and delicious! There's so many choices. It's great for families, friends because there's something for everyone. I had the Japanese noodles with steak and it's soooo good. I tried their tomato soup and it's a must try! Love that you can customize your meal as well."}
{"text":"The associate who helped me with my to go order was rude. I didn't appreciate that at all. I'm big on good customer service and a poor attitude can change an entire trip!   My food was good. I love the Japanese pan noodles and was happy to see that I could substitute the noodles for gluten free noodles and also get rid of the sprouts and I think the mushrooms for other vegetables. I love this dish and I'm really glad it was somewhat as enjoyable as it used to be when I could eat the regular noodles. My dish was a bit dry as it pertains to the sauce... not sure if that was associate error but I know I have always had more sauce than what I had this visit. However, extra sauce is $1.00 extra I believe, I had to pass."}
{"text":"When my husband suggested trying this place out. I was hesitant because of the low ratings and it saddens me to give such poor rating to a place that has such great ideas but it was just that bad. We were there Wednesday for some dinner. My expectations were low because I was told it was a \"fast food\" noodle house. I got the Pad Thai Large and a side of the Thai soup. My husband for the Indonesian Peanut Sauté- which actually had flavors to it. I couldn't say the same for my orders. Try soups was bland as can be. Tasted like watered down twice broth. The Pad Thai was a giant of nothing but chewy noodles. I got the organic tofu with it. No flavor there either. Which is fine because I didn't expect to stellar Pad Thai. But to make matters worse, -get ready for way too much information- I had diarrhea twice the next day. I'm from Asia, lived there for 7 years, my immune system is crazy good. But not good enough for this place. I knew it had to be from here because it was the only thing that was out of my norm. So we called them, kindly gave them heads up that their food made me sick incase other people called in. We spoke with the manager and she did not even apologize. That's what prompted this review. Really? Not even a sorry, just \"ok we will look into it.\""}
{"text":"Great selection of noodles, staff are very helpful great customer service, very clean store great food handling. We love this place"}
{"text":"Ordered a pad thai to go right before the dinner rush. It was awful. It tasted like the cook didn't rinse out the pan after cooking spaghetti. I usually love eating the pad thai, but this was just too oily and the taste was soooooo off. Sad :("}
{"text":"This place sucks. Their food sucks, their staff was completely incompetent as they never refunded my money as they said they would."}
{"text":"Very friendly and food is always done right and in a timely manner. Place is very clean"}
{"text":"Their spicy korean beef noodle have a creamy not so spicy sauce, noodles are cooked just right. Thai chicken soup is delicious too-- can be a meal if paired with bread or rice! Rice crispy is chewy and got a milky taste-- that I need to order another one for to go!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Tables were not cleaned and the employees were not willing to clean as well. Very rude and unhygienic."}
{"text":"A suburban strip mall noodle chain may not sound like the makings of a delicious meal, but I have NEVER been disappointed by my order here. It's clear that each dish is made fresh to order and the flavors are well-executed and authentic. My vegetarian husband thinks their pad-thai is actually pretty good, and I have been impressed with all of the Italian inspired pastas. The chicken noodle soup is also extremely tasty. Take-out is a cinch and well packaged for the ride home. My only complaint: they used to have Fresca on tap and took it away! Not that I blame them - I think I might be one of the only people left in America that really drinks it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something that is fast and tasty it's a great spot with a lot of options.  Their team was really helpful in explaining the menu and service was top notch!"}
{"text":"The chicken bowl was a good portion and tasty. Seasoned nicely. A better option than traditional fast food places we could have stopped at. Did not experience any of the downsides a few others posted about.   The atmosphere was nice. The selection was good. We will stop in again.  https://locations.noodles.com/az/gilbert/2975-south-market-street.html"}
{"text":"First time at a Noodles (Monday, 8/31/2015, 2:35 p.m. - please give appropriate Kudos to employees on shift) - Wow!  What a truly delicious and enjoyable experience!   From the moment I entered the door, I was treated as though I were Queen of the Day!    The gentleman at the front counter was very courteous, kind and attentive, letting me know that if I had any questions to feel free to ask.  Where does that happen at a fast food sort of place?!  I decided to go with the barbecue pork sandwich and Thai curry soup.  Food came out very quickly, was hot, and tasted absolutely divine!    Great job, Noodles, for doing a great job, hiring some great people, and giving me a new favorite place to eat when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Here on business to train some folks and stopped into this gem for lunch. Noodles were perfect. Wait... let me say that again. Noodles were FRIGGEN GOOD. I had the steak stroganoff and was met with great flavor from the steak, from the noodles and the sauce that melded together perfectly. Ever been to a place where all the ingredients taste the same? Not here. I love coming to Tempe Marketplace; the noodles bring me back!"}
{"text":"Sad lunch! I ordered the penne rosa and there was barely any sauce in the dish--more like penne rosa flavored noodles. There were barely any tomatoes and maybe 2 spinach leaves. Quality has gone way down hill--you used to get giant chunks of tomato and plenty of spinach in a saucy bowl. It's absolutely absurd that Noodles & Co. is charging any money for this."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I simply ordered a pad Thai and a small ceasar salad as a side. The pad Thai was a lot spicier than I imagined & quite bland. Although it was not terrible, I would prob not order it again. And I'll just leave this here....I asked for croutons in the ceasar salad and I got ONE. ONE crouton."}
{"text":"Did people read in Post Gazette business column on March 4,2017 edition that Noodles were closing? About time! Its a ripoff and worse food too. Not even worth a star is this place closed yet?"}
{"text":"My favorite place to come and eat some noodles. I believe it's better then Sauce. My first time trying it was in Champaign, IL. Then they built one in AZ  my favorite is the PenneRosa with Parmesan crusted chicken. You can add any meat to your noodles and sauce. Also they have 2 different size bowls, small and large(regular). The next best pasta is the Mac & cheese. The workers are really nice and friendly. Definitely will be back. Also on International noodle day they give you a free Mac & cheese if you buy a regular bowl(large bowl). Happy International noodle day"}
{"text":"The worst noodles I've ever been to.  By far. Very dirty and slow. And they got the meat kind wrong. When they brought out the correct one 15 min later. They just brought a side of it. I had to pick out the wrong meat and eat cold noodles with it. I would have though they would have brought me a new bowl."}
{"text":"Not coming here again. The noodles were so tasteless I didn't even eat them. Wish I could get my money back because it was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"New restaurant Friday for my colleagues and I , this is a new location. I have been to the one in Cranberry. Service was fast, and everyone was polite. Food was what you would expect, I had the buttered noodles with meatballs. Should have gotten the spaghetti. I am going to try something different next time. Hey, I learned how to use chop sticks correctly. They did good and I look forward to return."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company has long been one of my favorite \"not quite fast\" food chains.  I still have very fond memories of visiting the State St. location (aka: the SECOND ever Noodles!) while visiting Madison visiting in high school and throughout college as a student here...when it was pretty new...because I'm old. ;)  I love that some of their staples have been there forever - Wisconsin Mac and Cheese and Mushroom Stroganoff are two old standbys for me, and I'm also loving how much the Noodles menu has expanded over the years. I like that now meat is an option that you can choose and pay extra for, instead of the past when I would have to order a meaty dish and ask for it without meat. I also love that they label their vegetarian items on their menu. I've learned the hard way that many, many...MANY times when you order something you think is a vegetarian item it is actually made with with a meat base. I also think their prices, while definitely not cheap, are reasonable, especially when you consider how much pasta you get in the big bowls.   I was thrilled when another Noodles location (how many are there in Madison now?!) opened up even closer to me in Middleton.  This is a great family friendly option for when we are brave enough to take our entire brood out for dinner. My six year-old daughter and I visited for the first time on a weeknight at about six p.m.  I want to make sure that my review reflects this particular location, rather than the chain as a whole.  Here are my thoughts:  1. The layout is nice. The decor is nice.  I love that the dining room is broken up into to sections and there is a little area in the back that is cut off a bit from the main dining room. This was perfect for the poor family with the screaming toddler, which happened to not be my family, for once!  There are tables, booths (or at least one in the back) and some counter seating.  A nice variety.  2. The staff was exceptionally friendly, including both the girl who took our order and the one who brought our food. They were accommodating when I requested my food without a certain ingredient. The girl who brought the food did forget to take our table number, but no big deal.  3. I was so, so happy to see that Noodles now offers a legitimate \"kid's meal\" where you get some noodles, two sides, and a drink for five dollars. My daughter chose the Mac and Cheese, broccoli, and a \"kid krispie\" which is just a small version of their totally delicious Rice Krispie treats.  She ate it all and enjoyed it all. Her only complaint was that the food was \"just warm...not really hot.\" I have mixed feelings - I know they are catering to kids and don't want them to burn their mouths, but I also know that eating cold broccoli is not so yummy.  4. They have one of those crazy cool soda machines that lets you make any random, awesome, maybe nasty combination of soda ever. I used the cup from my daughter's kid's meal and got her an Izze soda, so I felt especially cool with my little tiny cup. ;)  5. My food (the Penne Rosa) tasted great and was, indeed, hot. My one itty, bitty, tiny complaint is that when they brought the food, there was sauce and cheese all over the bowl (inside - sides above where the pasta sat, not the outside...you can see it in the photo). I know, you are rolling your eyes reading this, but honestly...if Noodles wants to present itself as a \"nicer\" dinner option, they need to have a good presentation, and a messy bowl just don't convey that image. Also, can someone from Noodles confirm this for me...do you put a random piece of contrasting pasta in every pasta dish, because every SINGLE time I eat at Noodles I always get one (just one) random \"other\" pasta. This time it was a corkscrew in my penne. My daughter had fun trying to figure out how it got all curled up that way. ;)  6. Finally, one more little area for improvement - when we sat down, the table next to us had two empty soda bottles on it. When we left, the table next to us had the same two empty soda bottles on it.  The restaurant wasn't packed and the table on the other side of us was bussed while we were dining. Just keep you eyes open a little more.  I think I am going to love having this Noodles & Company close..."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place opening. However, both times I've went I was disappointed. My noodles were not cooked long enough, the food was bland & not hot."}
{"text":"BAD BAD BAD..I realize they haven't been open very long, but come on.  I got there at 12:20 pm.  The line to order was moving slow, so I decided to try to place an order online.  Online indicated that my order (Pad Thai with Shrimp) would be ready at 12:43.  I finally got to the cashier and paid and waited, and waited.  Finally (after observing several frustrated customers) I received my order at 1:05.  Once back at my desk to eat and the omitted the shrimp that I paid for.  The noodles had no sauce at all on them.  I called the restaurant only to be put on hold for 10 minutes - I've hung up and crossed this restaurant off my list."}
{"text":"This is a horrible Noodles & Co. Every time I come in, there is a long line and only one person working the register (even though there are tons of employees typically socializing together) who usually seems like they would rather be doing anything but working the register (As a former waitress, I feel the pain but fake it till you make it when it comes to customer service).   The food takes FOREVER because the employees stand and talk to each other constantly.   Finally, they don't know the menu. I asked if they still had buff bowls and they were unsure if they did and one was unsure what that was. My favorite menu item is the Chicken Veracruz salad and 4/5 times I've ordered it here, they've \"forgotten\" to add avocado and proceeded to argue with me that it didn't come on it, even though it was specifically  listed on the menu under the salad's description. Personally, I think they are trying to save $ by skimping on the avocados.   I love Noodles food, but the customer service is really awful at this location and the employees need significantly better training."}
{"text":"It's a chain so the food is pretty consistent - pretty good. This location seems to stand out though, and not in a good way.  First, not a single employee seemed even slightly pleased to be there. I thought it was kind of like high school detention.  Secondly, the service beyond the counter was horrible. They would bus the tables and not once did someone clean a table. Strike that, customers would clean a table so they wouldn't stick to them. At least three employees walked by as I dipped napkins in water so I could wipe the detritus off the table.  Then there seemed little effort to replenish the utensils or napkins. I do think I saw one of the employees who was bussing tables put 2 knives in the bin. Maybe they were from the wash, but if so, she was holding them while bussing. They were out of forks, so I counted myself lucky to get a plastic one.   Other locations have been good, so I'm assuming this one is managed by someone unfamiliar with food services."}
{"text":"Here's a list: - smells TERRIBLE - food ALWAYS has hair or stray mystery meat (vegetarians beware) - dirty ... - most attendants are mean - worse shrimp ever   The one star was for the lady who had our order to our table. She was nice. She said \"Bon appetite\" and left. We liked her the most."}
{"text":"The cashier was nice and my food was ready for pick up when I got there. I ordered the Korean beef noodles and spaghetti and meatballs. They claim to use Korean hot pepper paste ( gojuchang) but it tasted Nothing like it. It was spicy alright but didn't have any other flavor that's in gojuchang. Also it was too sweet in my opinion and I had to add some kimchi to be able to eat it. I was not expecting full Korean flavor seeing as it's not a Korean restaurant but I think they can improve a lot. Also there was something about the texture of the noodles, it wasn't spaghetti but it wasn't ramen. There were not enough sprouts either I think I counted like 5 strings.   Moving on to the spaghetti and meatballs they were edible too but not delicious. My kids who love meat balls didn't like their meatballs. There was also a sweet note to it which I find odd."}
{"text":"First time ever hearing about noodles & company. Was here for work and was looking for something quick to eat. A friend suggested noodles & company. It's definitely good. You do need to pay for the meat extra if you want some.   My favorite is the penne ross with chicken. The mac and cheese is also delicious.   Now we finally got on in Arizona as well."}
{"text":"So I have been to this noodles & company many times before. Usually its pretty good. It seems to take longer than other times to prepare the food, however service is usually friendly.  This time I decided to try the shrimp green Thai Curry. Flavor wise it was great. It's got a kick of spice in it. Sadly  it was really dry. Like dry enough to have the noodles all sticking together. I would of liked some sauce or something, but nope dry, yet flavorful noodles. I put some soy sauce in it to give it some sauce and that did the trick. Anyways, The potstickers are usually good and their caeser dressing it good. ** note-the side caeser salad is really a tiny cup of salad."}
{"text":"Will not eat here ever again. The taste is bland. The bowls are big but not satisfying. You can tell the food was not up to par. We ordered their new meatball special and let me tell you one bite of it was enough. The quality of the food is beyond what they say. I definitely do not reccomended it at all."}
{"text":"Cool in concept, but lacks in execution. We visited on a really busy night, and had a terrible time getting a table. The Mac and Cheese was flavorless. The Japanese Udon noodles were better, but since they're cooked on the grill, some were burnt black, and that's just not how I like my Udon. Plus, it was pretty expensive for a fast food café. Not terribly impressed."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try this place out - a break from the usual go-to spots.  Friendly staff and clean facilities but the food was just not that good.  It's easy to run up your tab too - Dropped $27 on lunch.    Large portion was indeed large.  I got the Korean noodles, wife got the Japanese noodles.    If I come back I'll be avoiding the Asian dishes.  Maybe their Mac n Cheese of Beef Stroganoff is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. The penne rosa is my face. Caesar salad is a great side. Nice to sit outside when it's not too hot."}
{"text":"Surprisedly as much as I go here, I haven't review it until now. I have always been a sucker for carb.. However, this place offers gluten free noodles.. So I somewhat feels I'm not overloading when I'm seriously craving for some.. I have alway order the penne rosa with grilled chicken, add gluten free pasta, no mushroom, extra spinach.. and I loved it every time.. customer service is alway great.. at one point I know my order by heart.. this place will be my go to when I'm craving for quick pasta but want something gluten free and no fuss.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time today when visiting South Hills. The service was friendly and the food was delicious! I got the spicy Korean noodles and they were extremely good. They are indeed spicy so be prepared. He got the Alfredo montamore. We also shared a shareable of the Korean BBQ meatballs. The food portions were decently sized. He was able to eat all of his and the meatballs but I struggled lol. Next time I'll have to get the small size rather than the regular. Our total was $27 with food and two drinks which was pretty cheap to us. We definitely will come back with friends. We're also excited for national Mac and cheese day!"}
{"text":"I love Noodles and Co in Chicago and the suburbs. I grew up essentially hanging out here with my friends in high school, getting fancy with our buttered noodles with different sauces each time..  However, this was a sore disappointment. My husband and I have been here several times and each time it's mediocre at best. Tonight (8/4/15) I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich with a cup of Chicken Noodle Soup. Unfortunately, the pork tasted fairly bland (except for that burn of pepper in the back of my mouth) and it felt like it had been shredded, then under a heat lamp, drying it out and making it super chewy. It even looked like how pork looks when it's been sitting on the edge of a slow cooker for hours... Very unappetizing.  The chicken noodle soup EVERY TIME has been super salty. If you like really salty stuff (my husband does), then go for it. However, I think it's just their generic recipe that's way too salty. I think it's the same chicken that they put on top of all the other dishes so that's salted, then salted noodles, and salty broth.. Ugh. This is the third time I have had the soup specifically. I've complained in the past about it being salty and the manager said they had to follow the recipe set by corporate.. :/  Staff has always been friendly, although a bit spacey. The cashier (young blonde girl) didn't really have any knowledge of the products. The person ahead of us wanted recommendations and the only thing she could say is \"it's good!\" to everything. I get that you don't wanna bash your company's food but you can at least say \"they are both good BUT I prefer the pad Thai..\" Or something like that."}
{"text":"Out of the two times i visited the store, this is not too bad of food, considering that they are just a chain store and they have both asian and western (somewhat of a bad combination in most cases) noodles, so yeah, they are not all too bad for a fast food store."}
{"text":"Surprisingly disappointing on multiple occasions.  I like Noodles and Co, but this specific location is consistently bad.  The tables and floor are always filthy, while staff stand around doing nothing.  Today, the only women's restroom sink was broken and would not rinse.  When we informed the staff, they said they were already aware.  They never marked the bathroom as being out of  order, and didn't do so even after we told them.  What a dump and what an unmotivated staff. This specific Noodles and Co is by far beneath the standards of any other Noodles I've ever patronized."}
{"text":"The one thing I love about Noodles is that the quality of food is always great! Your noodles always taste the same at every location. However, this location continuously struggles with preparing the correct order. Multiple times I have left with take out only to get home and find that they forgot to add the chicken, that I definitely paid for. The last time I called to let them know that they missed the chicken. They apologized and asked me to come back. No. Just no. I had to ask them to comp my meal which they did not do but they said that they would send 2 free entrees to my home address. It has been 8 days since my last visit and I still have not received my free entrees.   I don't feel like I should have to open each one of my entrees before leaving with take out, but if I do go back to that Noodles, I will be the annoying lady taking up counter space opening each entree to ensure I have my protein. Sorry for the inconvenience if you're standing behind me."}
{"text":"Probably the best Noodles I've ever visited, probably mostly due to its interior setup. Three floors? Epic. Location? Epic. Window seating galore? Praise. It's a people watcher's paradise, the tables are great for getting stuff done during lunch or just looking like you're not a complete loner. And, despite what the other reviews may say (ouch, sorry guys), it's pretty hard to mess up my go-to dishes: buttered noodles and the mac & cheese with meatballs."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm on my grind to shop for Thanksgiving food cause you know it's a week away and I'm not trying to fight someone at the store for a turkey leg ya dig.  Anyway, I'm hungry as sh*t and I know it's best for me to fill my belly before I go shopping and forget to get the turkey or something. I don't eat fast food so I was excited to see a noodles and company.   Rock up in this spot just in time as right when I'm placing my order, the whole UNCA Girls Swim team comes thru. I'm thinking bet I placed my order before the gaggle of girls. Welp! That didn't matter cause I'm seeing dishes go out left and right to people who ordered AFTER me. I know what you're thinking... \"maybe they ordered a dish less complicated than yours\".... \"maybe some of them called in their orders\"... nah homie. I don't think so.   Someone comes out and asks what my name for the order is.... heh???   FINALLY my food comes out after I see at least 4-5 of the UNCA peoples gets their orders. Huuuu... this just put a dent in my shopping time.   Whatevs... eat my food, I shall."}
{"text":"Noodles and Company is clean and has a nice ambiance that is missing from most campus-town restaurants. The menu is wide-ranging, with American, Asian, and Mediterranean selections, and you get chose your protein (or save money and not chose one at all). There are a huge amount of drink options, from wine to organic milk. Another great thing is that they have nice brochures with nutrition info and lots of healthy food options.   Unfortunately, I find the food at  Noodles to be very inconsistent. Sometimes my field green salad is great, other times it is just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce. Other selections, even those labeled spicy, are a little on the bland side. Unfortunately it's also quite pricey for campus-town and it's often incredibly crowded during lunch. Another thing that annoys me is the excessive packaging for takeout: fancy bags and containers resembling tupperware are wasteful even if they are labeled \"made with a chemical to speed up breakdown.\"  But I still come back. They have food that is reasonably healthy and gives me a good dose of protein. I also like the variety of the menu. I love that I can get potstickers with my tomato soup, so that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure why diners are giving this place negative reviews. The service was great and we had the Steak Stroganoff, Indonesian Peanut Sauté & Japanese Pan Noodles.  And an extra order of meat balls, all were excellent. Perhaps the price may be an issue, but still food and service was very good."}
{"text":"We ordered in trays for a coworker's retirement luncheon. It was a great idea, it was a massive amount of food for 15 people. I've previously eaten with the Cranberry Township location and I'm not a fan as the food tastes processed but I really enjoyed the Alfredo pasta creation. If I was craving quick pasta, I would go here for the Alfredo."}
{"text":"What the heck has happened to Noodles & Co?! My last several visits to the State Street location have been quite mediocre.  I remember way back when Noodles was a new thing. Before they had locations all over. The Pesto Cavatappi was my favorite. Oh man, was it good. But now it's just not the same. The pesto flavor is muddled and not very pesto-y. It's just bland.  Yesterday there was an unexpected rush of business around lunch, and you could tell. There was a long line of folks waiting for to-go orders, and my food took longer than usual to arrive at the table. People were grumbling, as this is a fast-casual joint after all.   The server was apologetic and nice, and it really didn't bother me much. But my food was cold. Cold, bland pesto noodles. At least the parmesan chicken was well-cooked and delicious.   Overall, not worth the almost $9 I spent for it. Perhaps I should check out a different location in Madison to see if they are any better."}
{"text":"This place offers one of the best different styled pastas and noodles at one place. The difference between regular and small was quite insignificant though. Going with small size and your favorite choice among the options is the best way to go."}
{"text":"I could not wait to go to Noodles & Co [today was the day]; and in the words of my amazing Husband this place \"sucked anus\"!   I ordered the Pad Thai with Organic Tofu.  Here is my recap: - The entire dish was dry;  - The Noodles were overcooked and sticky: I can feel them, like a big rubber ball, sitting in my stomach; - The Tofu appeared to be deep-fried: it was an odd shade of brown and the texture resembled that of chewing gum; - There was no flavor to the dish other than that of the oil they used to saute the undercooked carrots and onions - lots-and-lots of onions; - And, where were my peanuts and cilantro?  This is not Thai, which is all about the balance of flavors and spices, salty, sweet and heat!  I am all about giving the benefit of the doubt, but have reservations about giving this place a second-shot: I would much rather risk the cockroaches at the Lemongrass Cafe and get my Pad Thai there... Eew!!!"}
{"text":"They have portion sizes made just for me...depending on how I'm feeling, it's nice to select from two sizes: the \"eat in moderation\" or the \"I'm really hungry\" portion.   The Pad Thai was good and what I expected from a non-Thai food place.   The service was very helpful and friendly. Although not a typical table-service place, they bring you your food and offer to get you whatever you need. They have a nice sized patio facing South Blvd, however, you cannot bring alcoholic beverages out there...stay inside to finish your drink!   Will return to satisfy my noodle craving."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company has good food but is pricey. You have to pay extra for meat and get barely any of it when you do get it. Overall, it's a good place but I personally feel like I could make some pasta at home and it would be cheaper and better. But if your in a rush and craving pasta I would definitely hit them up."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend this past weekend.  Really enjoyed my dish however, they seemed to have some sort of mix up because after waiting 10 minutes on it I had to go back and check it and they remade it for me. Not sure how they ended up giving it to another customer or if it was taken by one while I was waiting but I'll still gladly visit them again. The portions are just right and when it comes down to water matters most, taste and quality of food, I had no issues."}
{"text":"Me and my 14 year old son was on break from a chess tournament and decided to grab something to eat. As soon as I walked in I seen that the picture on the menu are misleading. It shows the bowl filled and the bowl they give you are huge.. However they dont even fill the bowls half way. Now mind you I am a big eater and this review will be based on that.  I ordered the Pasta Fresca with chicken and my son got the Buttered noodles. We received our order and we got exactly what I noticed. My son loved his buttered noodles and I loved the taste of the Pasta Fesca. However, I expected more for the the price I paid for it since pasta and noodles are so cheap. Me and my son was both hungry after a couple hours later.  This review is based on a big eater. So if you are use to eating with small portions, I would rate this as a 4 or 5. However I will only give a 3 on this and debating if I should give it a 2.   It is such a shame since it is so close to the university and students are on a budget. They probably would get a lot more customers from them if they gave bigger portions or cut down on the price."}
{"text":"Faster service then others in the area. Always good food. Been many times and always enjoy it. Gets really busy sometimes but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for their simple salads but the salads were tasty and fresh.  I had the Chinese chicken salad.  I saw somebody eating the Mac and cheese which looked quite tasty and will be on my list for next time."}
{"text":"Recently service staff have been a total mess. They've messed my order up on my last three visits. They need to pay more attention.  Food is standard noodles. They do continue to introduce some new interesting dishes."}
{"text":"This food is SO good! The service is friendly and quick. It's also good for family & Kids. This is my second time eating here and I'll be back again. My kids always ask me if we can come back and eat here once we're done. I'd give it 6 stars."}
{"text":"We've been excited for this place to open, tried it for the first time tonight. The cost was approximately $19 for one small bowl, one regular bowl and a tiny salad. We asked to see the bowl sizes before we ordered, they were impressive. Unfortunately, the bowls are barely half full. Not a great value. In fact, I'm sitting in the restaurant about to leave and we will stop by In-N-Out burger to fill up. As for value, I would give it a three on a 10 point scale.  The restaurant has some inherent problems. It is pretty busy, likely because it is new, and they have one soda machine with a long line, a very small condiment and drink station with a line, seating on the side that you would never know is there and the bathrooms are single person, not conducive to a busy place. It's pretty loud even at three quarters full. So for layout, I would give it a five on a 10 point scale.  The food is a six on a 10 point scale. We ordered the Japanese pan noodles and the spicy Korean beef noodles. Neither were remarkable, somewhat bland. And not plentiful.  Atmosphere is decent, a bit cramped. There are many staff members, all seem to be extremely friendly, which is very nice. They are all running around diligently to keep everyone fed and the place relatively clean. For staff, I would give it a nine on a 10 point scale.  This place has a great location with lots of traffic. But, in order to make it, some changes will certainly be required. Would we come back? I would give that a five on a 10 point scale."}
{"text":"Nothing delicate about this place. I would rename it noodles for people with dead taste buds. For instance when the description of Japanese noodles says \"sweet soy sauce\" think molasses. Alfredo very heavy on cheese and very salty tasting. Never had a dish here that was memorable in a positive way."}
{"text":"Pasta bowls quick and easy. All bowls are pretty big and very reasonably priced. Everything tastes fresh and well prepared, and there's a huge variety of choices. Kids love it"}
{"text":"We visited this new-to-us restaurant last night as a family and thanks to the variety they offer, everyone was able to find something to try.  My spicy Korean beef was indeed spicy, as was my husband's Chipotle Adobo, and arrived fresh and hot in large bowls.  I was already checking out the menu to see what I'd order during my next visit, it was that good!  I'd love to try the Japanese Pan Noodles, the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese, or the Steak Stroganoff, and an order of their cheesy garlic bread.    My only complaint was they have one Coca-Cola Free-Style dispenser (I hate those) which had people standing in line to refill their drinks.  I got up a few times to refill my water and sat down to wait after seeing the long lines."}
{"text":"My noodles came out luke warm, husband came out nice and hot. As we sit here and wait for our food the tables we not cleaned, the signage on the table nasty dirty and Soda area a mess not properly stocked. Bathroom rooms in women's little dirty. Overall not impressed at all. Customer service of staff below what I expect for a food establishment in Gilbert. Next door is the habit, I like it there 100% better!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my last visit. There's 3 things I normally get, and 2 were taken off the menu. The other one was rice crispie, which there weren't any made. (No rice crisps seem to be an ongoing problem here.) The cashier was extremely unfriendly. She was rolling silverware and looked upset that she had to take my order. I tried being extra friendly, and thanked her for everything. She just gave me a dirty look and went back to silverware. Not acceptable. Part of the job is at least being pleasant!  Also, there are NEVER any clean tables. it appears they pick the dishes and garbage up off of them, but never wipe them. I almost always have to go up to the counter and ask someone."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, the food is not complicated but the flavor is great. Good balance cost-benefit."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while and the employees have never been overly friendly or even motivated to do their jobs well. I went there today and my friend ordered the spaghetti and marinara sauce, and specified that she did NOT want cheese or meatballs on top, she even repeated this twice. So when they brought out our food of course there were meatballs on top. She told the man that she asked for no meatballs and so he brought it back, came back three minutes later with the same bowl of spaghetti except now it had 5 meatball indents where the meatballs had been... it was almost comical the way it looked. Did they really think this was acceptable? They didn't even ATTEMPT to make it look like they gave a sh*t about their presentation. So she brought it back again and asked him if they just took the meatballs off and he said yes, and she asked if she could have a whole new one because she's vegan and can't eat anything that has touched meat. So 25 minutes pass, still no food. When she goes over to ask where her food is, they tell her that they haven't even started making it yet. Meanwhile people who had come in 25 minutes after us were getting their food already. So by the time she finally got her pasta we had been there for an hour. The worst part? The girl who had messed it up in the first place was laughing at my friend as if she was an idiot or doing something wrong. Very poor customer service. So disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place went down hill quick!!! The first time it was pretty good, quick service, food was good and presentation was good. Second visit, disappointing. Very sloppy presentation, and employees arguing at the counter was off putting. Taste was good, so we gave it just one more shot. Man, I'll ever go back. Cashier was rude, and repeated my order back wrong twice, when I corrected her she got upset. Not one, but all of the food I ordered was wrong. Mac n cheese with bean sprouts and peanuts on it, pad Thai had no veggies or chicken, just noodles. And the sandwich was not only make wrong, but the wrong sandwich all together. It's clear the foundation was good, but the management clearly doesn't care about quality."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Noodles & Co. I feel like it is one of those places that you need to go to a few times to find \"your thing\". I appreciated that the would do a spinach base instead of noodles if you want to be healthier. The flavor was just okay, but I think with some tweaking it could be really good."}
{"text":"Nothing to really write home about with this place. I ordered the pesto pasta with chicken. I personally think I can make it better at home. At least they gave me free dessert since I came late in the night close to closing time."}
{"text":"When I noticed this place in the Walmart parking lot before it opened, all I could think of was \"just what we need, another crappy Asian AYCE place to go out of business within 2 years\".  What a pleasant surprise to find an AMERICAN chain (based in Colorado) has decided to open in Durham region!  Joy!    Their schtick is noodles obviously, but not what you might be expecting. This isn't an Asian noodle joint, nor is it trying to compete with East Side Mario.  I'd say it's BOTH!   On separate visits I've had the steak stroganoff and the alfredo mont'amore and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and portion size.  You'll leave full, but the portions aren't so huge that you can't finish half of it.  They have the quality/quantity balance nailed.  Always place your order online so you don't have to wait as long on arrival.  I live about 10 minutes away so I submit my order before leaving my house and my food is ready for me as soon as I get there. Unlike other places (like Starbucks) you don't pay ahead with online ordering.   Soft drinks are unlimited refill (the fountains are out in the dining area).  East Side Mario sucks huge and I wish we didn't lose the Olive Garden, but until/unless OG returns to Canada, Noodles and Company truly fits the bill, at a slightly lower price point.  Highly recommended.  Now I wish more American chains would come up here (*ahem* SHAKE SHACK *ahem*)...  Support these guys and maybe more will show up!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today to order at around 4pm. Place wasn't that busy so I figured it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to get the food. Ordered a small size Bangkok Curry but ended up getting charged for a regular size. When I asked for the receipt and noted that I was charged incorrectly so it then took another 10 minutes to get a manager even though there weren't any customers in line. The girl who processed the order didn't even bother to apologize for her mistake. When the manager finally came out she tried to convince me to not get it refunded because the amount was so minuscule but I declined because I wasn't hungry enough to eat the regular serving size. She managed to refund the card but seemed oblivious to how this was a problem and when I opened up the bag I found that once again they had served me the regular size meal. After cooking it twice and not getting the order right, the food was pretty good as usual. Terrible customer service and a sense of apathy, not to mention taking 20 minutes to do an order with no other customer. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"When it's 82 degrees in Pittsburgh...in March...I'll take any excuse I can get to sit outside in Market Square.  Today's excuse was a much-anticipated inaugural trip to Noodles & Company.  I ordered online with 7 other co-workers; which is a great feature their website and one you should DEFINITELY take advantage of no matter how small or large your group may be. Otherwise, get ready to WAIT. Seriously. The line was capital E - Epic and the atmosphere was chaotic to match.  I will say this - their online ordering system was down today, so the pick-up of our order was a little messy.  But the manager eventually made good on all of our orders, so I'm going to let it go.  Our selections ranged from my own Bangkok Curry to a couple of Pad Thais, a salad and a few Italian noodle dishes thrown in for good measure.  Out of 10, the highest rating my co-workers gave to their own respective dishes was 8 and the lowest 6; though after further thought I might change my 6 to a 5.  My Bangkok Curry was totally fine.  Fresh broccoli, well-cooked noodles, but lacking in spice. Just nothing special and now I smell like an onion.  Definitely not worth waiting in that insane line for (even though I didn't, as an online orderer), but worth it enough to pay $5 for.    I'd recommend going once, maybe twice to try another genre of noodle dish.  Beyond that, there are so many more local, interesting joints that serve noodles in this awesome city of ours."}
{"text":"I suppose I see why this spot is three stars.  First of all the flavor of the japanese noodles was great.  But I almost ended up with someone else's food.  I ordered beef on mine and to be honest it would be hard to tell if there was any animal protein in the meal.  Decent taste, meh experience."}
{"text":"I found their menu very confusing, and when I asked the cashier about the different portion sizes, she grossly under-described how much the small portion would be in order to sell the larger portion - which was too much - a small portion would have been sufficient.  I also think the prices are high for this type of establishment.  My bowl of noddles and a salad went from what I thought was going to be around $6 to $11!  I only live 3 miles from the restaurant, and when I arrived home, the noodles were very chewy & there wasn't hardly any sauce in them.  Waste of money!"}
{"text":"If you want over cooked pasta and fake meat this is the place to go. I wanted something different and so since I had the tomato soup and liked it I decided to go back and try other dishes. The beef stroganoff was dry and the meat was rubbery. The Korean meat balls texture is not meaty it's more of an artificial meat. Horrible food."}
{"text":"Wanted a bite to eat after work and walked into noodles and co. Was greeted by a friendly, smiling young man who was extremely helpful (he really couldn't have been more pleasant). He helped me decide,gave his recommendations, and he could probably tell it was my first time there.   I ordered the whole wheat noodles w balsamic, tomatoes, spinach, red onions and garlic (forget the name of dish). It came out in no longer than 5 minutes and the service really was spectacular. Wish I had more noodles in the serving, but all in all it was a pretty good first experience.    Gave it a 4 due to spotting an employee texting behind the counter.. Also the same guy who was extremely helpful in the beginning flirted with me while I was ordering. My man  couldn't have been more than 18. Sometimes a girl just wants to order her noodles!"}
{"text":"The section of food is surprisingly diverse.  Excellent noodles and pastas. The Korean meatballs were a tasty surprise.  Quick, efficient and friendly service is something I've come to expect from this location. So far they have been top notch!  Plenty of seating! Is on Pitt campus and is a favorite of the students."}
{"text":"Close by to my place of work and have been there several times  Love the concept that most dishes start vegetarian  and you can add proteins if you like. For a vegetarian like me it's perfect at good price point as well. The quality is good.   This time around I had Whole Grain Tuscan Fresca with Parmesan cheese. The red onion was good but the spinach quantity not so. Would prefer Basil instead. The regular size is perfect for me but a tad too greasy for me. (Note to self request less oil)  The party with me had a small Mac & Cheese ( I have had it before). The quantity for small was quite decent and perfect amount of cheese  Not know how Japanese noodles were but they looked really good (note to self - Try it next time)  We also had Garlic Bread with was good as usual but not enough cheese. The Marinara Sauce that comes with it is to die for.   Have tried the Indonesian Peanut Sauté and is really good as well. Would go back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Skeptical to say the least when visiting this chain for the first time.....That is, until I tried the food! So I got the Indonesian Bowl, and this had some very spicy sauce with peanuts, and I added chicken as well for protein.  Well, I GOTTA say it was damn tasty! Pad Thai-ish with the sweet noodles and spiciness of the sauce, this really tasted good!  Not QUITE as big as other Asian Chain restaurants, but the food was really good! Service was adequate, and overall, a really good experience!  Looking forward to going back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the food is good. The portion sizes are never consistent. You never know what you'll get, very frustrating."}
{"text":"Pretty crummy operation. Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs without the meatballs (that may be the problem: I didn't pay enough). There was so little sauce on the pasta that when I opened the container when I got home I was overwhelmed with the smell of starch.   I complained to a manager who stated that they get that complaint a lot. According to her explanation, the staff is limited by management in terms of the amount of sauce they can use.   I tried the place because it was so cheap. Well, you get what you pay for. If you want to go cheap, del taco; it can't be any worse than this."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. I decided to try this new place since I adore Asian cuisine! Customer service was friendly and helpful. The place was beautifully setup and clean. Now the sad part :( the food made my tummy very unhappy since I had a belly at the end of my meal. I ordered two types of meals hoping to satisfy my diverse taste (pasta with beef and Korean with steak) sadly disappointed by the taste and chewiness of the meat. It might've been the person that made it or the ingredients used. This is my first and mostly likely, my last time here."}
{"text":"I actually just came here on a whim as I was in the area ordering pizza. I've been wanting pasta, so it was a no brainer to stop by. I walked in without checking Yelp first, once I was inside waiting on my food, I \"checked in\", and realized how low the rating was. Now I honestly didn't bother to read the reviews as I had already ordered my food: penne rosa without mushroom with Parmesan cheese and Parmesan crusted chicken. My only complaint is that this dish was supposed to be spicy, and it was not :-( Other than that I have no complaints, I liked the addition of the fresh tomato and fresh spinach in my meal. The food was actually good, I was expecting the chicken to be fried, it wasn't but equally as good. I will be coming back as there are no serious complaints as to why I shouldn't stop back in again."}
{"text":"I think this might be the only place in the area that consistently gets my order right.  I always get take out so I can't speak to the dine-in experience.  My food is always fresh, the proper temperature, nicely packaged and correct.  This location in particular has been very pleasant."}
{"text":"If I was able to I would give this place ZERO stars!! The lady at the register was not knowledgable about the menu which was off putting since it was my first time and I knew more about the menu then she did, very disappointing. I ordered the Mac and cheese cheesesteak, which was recommended by the guy who helped clean our table. It tasted awful! It had no flavor, the bread was cold and huge chunks of steak. My sister got the pad tai and it just didn't taste right or good and the noodles were undercooked. I will not be back again and would not recommend!! Eat at your own risk!!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty. They are striving for the best. Great job Fitchburg location."}
{"text":"Good lunch place. Not too pricey. We have been twice. Better quality than other places like this. We enjoyed sitting outside on a beautiful day. I like that they bring you your food and clean up after you. The food was good. Good size portions. There are options of different style food. If someone wants Italian, or Asian, or macaroni and cheese you will find it there. That worked well for my family. Will go again for lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty good .. Chef made my food before I officially ordered because counter person was AWOL which was okay because they were cooking before I ordered Bangkok curry.  Soda plus food was about $9-10 bucks.  Not over portioned so perfect size .. I added chicken to the noodles.. And that was decently tasty. Ambiance was good.. And I would like try the place again.  It was late late afternoon so not crowded and they bused my table and kept it clean as I was hanging out there for awhile after finishing my plate.  Free wifi at this location if needed."}
{"text":"Nooooo!!!  I was so sad this morning when I went for my daily \"Jam and Ham - No Jam\", to find that Noodles & Co.  is closed!  The food was great, the people were fantastic, and a visit there was the favourite part of my morning routine.  I wish all the best to the great staff, and many thanks for all the great breakfasts and lunches!  You will be missed!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a to-go order of Thai chicken soup, potstickers and a pad thai.  Loved the food, just the right amount of flavors that goes easy on the palette. The soup was rich and creamy and a must try one.  Potsitickers (dumplings) are my most favorite food item and it was delicious with the soy sauce on the side. Pad thai felt a bit dry, especially the chicken because it was grilled and place on top of the noodles as a topping or something, but overall taste was good.  It wasn't too oily or saucy which is how I was used to eating pad thai before.  this version of pad thai did feel \"healthy\". Interesting thing about this place is they put the amount of calories beside each item on their menu."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and the prices are fairly reasonable considering the portion sizes; however, what really stood out to me was the service.  I ordered food online and picked it up.  Upon leaving and then later beginning to eat it, though, I realized that they didn't include shrimp in my meal.  Normally, I wouldn't care all that much, but since I had paid extra for it I decided to go back for either a 2.00 refund or to see if they could add shrimp.  Anyway, the guy really apologized and insisted on giving me a whole new fresh meal.  Since mine was partially eaten and I felt bad wasting the rest of it, I said that wasn't necessary and asked if they could just add shrimp to it.  The guy did, and then insisted on giving me a card for a free meal the next time come.  Very impressed by that."}
{"text":"First time here. Portions where small. I ordered the small pad Thai and the bowl was only 1/3 full.  The food wasn't bad but I'm going to be hungry in a little while. I won't waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food, prepared to order and very friendly & helpful staff!  When I walked in it may have been obvious it was my first time. Jeffrey came right over & offered assistance and suggestions. It all looked so good I decided to order 3 different dishes in the small portion. I seriously had to stop myself from ordering more! I can say they all taste delicious, were prepared as I specified and I can't wait to try other dishes! I ordered steak stroganoff, japanese pan noodles and the alfredo! Leftovers are for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Normally I love this chain, and the service is usually impeccable -except for this location. I drove in and ordered a carry out of two different entrees and a side order of potstickers. The server was pleasant and quick, and I received the food fairly promptly. However, when I got home with the takeout I found they had only packed half of my food. I called the store and was told that my options were that I could come back for my food and be given a coupon or \"something\", that I could talk to a manager, or they could credit my card for the half of my dinner I wasn't given.   I told the woman I spoke with on the phone that I would come back for the food, which she told me would be waiting for me along with something like a coupon that the manager would have for me. I drove back over less than 10 minutes later and had to wait in line to be given my food. The server asked what I wanted and then got my food, which was now cold. There was no coupon or card for a future discount to speak of. The server didn't bother to bag the food and when I asked for a bag he loudly scoffed, rolled his eyes and grabbed one and opened it but wouldn't even put the food in the bag. If I wanted to be treated to sullen teenage behavior and no apology of any kind I would have gone to McDonalds. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Today, Noodles & Co. has five hundred locations.  When I first discovered this chain in 1997, it had two locations.  The first Noodles & Company opened in 1996 in Boulder, CO.  A second location was added on State Street in Madison, WI in the same year.  I discovered Noodles & Co. at its second location in 1997.  This is a good chain to get an inexpensive bowl of pasta.  Don't expect anything that'll blow you away, however the food is good enough to return for another inexpensive bowl of pasta.  For some reason, I stick with the same two pasta bowls here: 1. The Pesto Cavatappi and 2. The Japanese Udon Noodles.  I've tried other vegetarian bowls on the menu, yet these two pasta bowls remain my go-to pasta dishes for over two decades.  I've ended up going to lots of Noodles & Company locations over the last two decades: in Minneapolis, MN, Portland, OR, Boulder, CO, Breckenridge, CO (with a gorgeous view of the Rockies), Chapel Hill, NC, and all over northern Virginia."}
{"text":"So disappointed. We received our order in pieces.  The food was not hot and we complained and you would think a manager would come over to ask. Nope. They really don't care here."}
{"text":"It's part of a chain. Their main specialty is noodle dishes with different twists along with three choices of sharable appetizers and soups. The noodle dishes themselves come in two different sizes (small or regular), the appetizers, and the soups themselves also have two different sizes, each at different prices. Depending on the season they might rotate a couple noodle dishes in here or there for a limited time (seasonal). While I found the selection of noodle dishes rather plentiful, I can't help but feel that the noodles themselves are at best average, especially for the price that I'm paying and considering that I can get better noodle dishes at surrounding joints for cheaper prices. Although I haven't tried all of menu choices, my favorite noodle dish is the spicy korean beef noodles. There's something nice about the simplicity of the dish, the sauce used in the dish is wonderfully tangy (though labeled sweet and spicy, it's actually not that spicy at all) the taste of it is a wonderful reminder of my Asian roots. In general, some of the other dishes tend to be more heavy in calories and biased towards Italian roots, which kinda kills the variety even though there are so many menu items. The cheesy garlic bread is pretty dope as an appetizer and the marinara that comes along with it is good. Location itself is well-kept and clean. Just be aware that it's near campus so it's usually busy during normal meal times (lunch and especially dinner)"}
{"text":"Sad to give a 1 star on the first review but you need a new manager who knows how to talk to people. Who ever was the man stopping the line last night was very rude. Why have people sign up if you will not honor their vouchers. Wasted my time and many other and to arrive and be spoken to like I'm a kid is bad for your business. Don't think I will ever come here again due to the rudeness of your manager who should be setting an example for all employees."}
{"text":"Love this place. Healthy \"fast food\" options, wide variety of dishes & they cater to your preferences. As a family, we all order what we want & leave here with leftovers! It is pricey compared to some places for fast food, but well worth it, to me."}
{"text":"I went to Noodles n Company and ordered the Japanese pan noodles with marinated steak. Total came out to $10 something. I shared my noodles with my cousins and was thoroughly disappointed! The noodles were salty and vinegary. Plus they cut the noodles into bite sized pieces, which was weird. Not enough meat, and meat add-on was like $2.79. Disappointed, especially when I think of all the other places I could've spent my money and gotten more out of it."}
{"text":"The food was average, service was okay, but the booths were disgustingly filthy.   All 3 weren't cleaned off, I wet a napkin and wiped the top which was almost black.  There were noodles in between the cushion and frame of the booth and there was a half inch of dust on the ledge of the booth.  I just tried not to think about what their kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"Based on the name, I thought the menu would more Asian however they also have pasta so there's a pretty good variety of choices. We tried a couple of pasta dishes which were delicious and plentiful. There's a fair sized sitting area however it gets loud. The service was quick."}
{"text":"At first this place looked like another noodle chain. But, I was impressed! It reminded me of crepevine in California but for noodles! Did that even make sense?  I liked their trio combo for 7 bucks (soup/salad and pasta with meat)! I had the pesto, but I'm definitely going back to try more things on their menu. They also have passionfruit iced tea that's rumored to be awesome."}
{"text":"As you may see I'm becoming a regular here. The pasta is fresh. Love there Potstickers too :-)"}
{"text":"I recently ate at this Noodles location before a concert at the Orpheum.   Pros: - The cashier at the front greeted us and was friendly. I like warm greetings when I enter establishments! - Cute, multi-level layout as this restaurant is situated in an old building on a corner. - Food was very tasty. I ordered buttered noodles with tofu, and my husband ate spaghetti and meatballs. - I hadn't eaten tofu at a Noodles restaurant before. It was actually incredible! The seasoning and sear on the tofu was excellent. - Good people-watching on State Street when sitting by a window.  Cons: - The restaurant overall is just dirty. I didn't get the impression that the restaurant was short-staffed, so I'm not sure why the restaurant seemed gross. On a side note, I also mentioned a concern about cleanliness in my Yelp review of the Noodles location near West Towne Mall. - Examples of the lack of cleanliness include: Old dishes/food sitting on tables for nearly 30 minutes, unkempt floors requiring sweeping and vacuuming, and a big puddle of something on the floor between the bathroom door and the kitchen with no \"caution/wet floor\" sign placed at the puddle.  While there was nothing terrible about my experience here, the cleanliness issue will likely make me avoid a return visit. Plus, State Street has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants, so I'd rather check out a new restaurant on State than go back to this Noodles location."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Noodles location.   I must say I had two concerns: 1. My alfredo sauce was watery. Alfredo sauce should be thick and creamy -- not watery! That makes me sad. 2. Location is dirty: The floors needed vacuuming, and lots of the empty tables needed busing and cleaning. In my opinion, I didn't think the restaurant appeared to be short-staffed and/or busy, so I'm not sure why the mess seemed excessive and why it seemed to linger.  I've been to other Noodles locations in Madison and never experienced these issues, so I will likely visit those in the future instead of this location again."}
{"text":"I like this place tried it with a few friends about two weeks ago. Food was surprising good. I like the concept of not have one specific origin of food but instead from all over basically anything that has to do with noodles. Very hip and good new concept and I will be returning to enjoy other noodle dishes"}
{"text":"After eagerly awaiting the opening of Noodles & Co I was very excited to try it. A friend and I arrived just after 12:30 and the line was nearly out the door. This wasn't surprising seeing it was a new restaurant, however, after finishing my meal and over hearing the comments of the diners around me, I can see this place having a steady 20 person line from 11:30 - 1:30. The interior is smartly designed, open, and bright. I also couldn't get over how great the staff was, everyone was very friendly and seemed like they legitimately were in a good mood and wanted to share that with you.   I did the \"Pick 3\" deal where you get a small noodle bowl, a choice of protein, and soup or salad for $7.99. I ordered the Indonesian Noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce (really awesome, perfectly \"make your nose run\" spicy, and packed with fresh vegetables), I added beef, and the Tomato Basil soup (my favorite part of the meal). By the time I added a drink my bill came to just under $10. I can't wait to come back and try some of their other options, I saw a meatball sub that looked pretty excellent."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to like Noodles and Company as much as I did.  But based on the convenience and great service I have to concede they are pretty good.  I ordered the Thai Hot Pot, which was very spicy and delicious.  The recipe was fairly authentic, and the price was excellent.  I did notice a sign that mentioned online ordering, and that looks like another convenience, especially when time is a factor.  There are plenty of other Asian offerings in Pittsburgh, however when speed, price and convenience are a necessity, Noodles & Company is a great option."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a place in the mall that served pad-Thai noodles. The staff was very friendly and the food was good! I'll definitely return and try another entree."}
{"text":"So interesting! Such diversity! I love the Thai hot pot and Chinese chicken salad but WHOA the Mac and cheese?!!?!? SOOOOO good. I was shocked. I first tried this place when I was in Idaho and was so happy to see I had one not too far from home. You must try this place!!"}
{"text":"Their salads suck! Mushy apples - overload of onions, etc. Not worth the price - I can't hope for a well made salad here..."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company is a restaurant I frequented when I lived in the DC area.  I'd heard the lines have been horrendous since it's opened, so decided to go there with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.  There were just a handful of patrons there and no line--Yay!  I ordered the Bankok Curry and my friend ordered the mac & cheese w/ meatballs.  We had just enough time to get our fountain drinks (lots of options and machine is Japanese-style and kind of fun) when our food arrived.  The server was pleasant and checked back with us a couple of times (also cleared away plates) which was a nice plus.  My dish was very good and although I ordered a \"regular\" it was on the small side for me.  However, it offered just the right amount of spice, the vegetables were fresh, and rice noodles perfectly cooked.  My friend reported that his mac & cheese was good (his portion was also a bit larger than mine, FYI) and looked like the cheese sauce looked like it was just the right consistency.  My dish, with a fountain drink (I opted not to get the shrimp on it), was about $7.50.  As far as lunch prices go for downtown, it's a hair more expensive than a fast-food choice like Wendy's, but more healthful.  If you have a heartier appetite you can opt for one of their trios.  I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite hole in the wall place in Oakland was closed for the holidays, and since I was hankering for asian food with not a lot of time on my hands, I chose Noodles & Company.  It was a Thursday night around 6 and the place was busy.  It's not a huge place to begin with (seats maybe 35?), you're all kind of close in, so no privacy.  It didn't bother me, but it did noticeably bother two girls that sat adjacent to me.  The thing that did bother me was the noise.  With all of the hard wall/floor/ceiling surfaces, but we're all kind of packed in a small area, plus everyone's talking, the tipping point on the noise was the piped in music.  It was Loud with a capital L.  Was this a nightclub or a casual restaurant?  Since I was there by myself it wasn't a deal breaker, but I would have had trouble carrying on a conversation with a mealmate.  The service at the counter was pleasant and efficient and it took very little time to get my food; I ordered the bankok curry noodle dish (regular) vegetarian style.  The Japanese-style soda machine is kind of cool.  I chose Diet Raspberry Diet Coke.  In a word:  don't.  Raspberry goes well with Sprite and iced tea, but Diet Coke?  Not so much.  Noodles & Company is a healthful alternative to fast food.  It you keep your dish as is without adding meat/tofu, with a drink it's about $7.50.  If you have a more hearty appetite, you'd do better at Chipotle or Qdoba, or if you're hankering Asian food, nearby non-chain Spice Island.  Final verdict:  does in a pinch, when I'm not starving, but not a restaurant I'd actively seek out to eat."}
{"text":"2 stars because it's usually a good place to eat but says they close at 10 and apparently \"the times changed a month ago\" smh"}
{"text":"I want one in Fayetteville. Had the Bangkok curry. Could of been of been spicier but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Noodles & Company, again during the lunch hour.  By now this establishmen is a couple months past the hype but it's only turned out so-so, three stars for me.  First, the girl who took my order was friendly, responsive, quick and attentive. After making up my mind, I got the Japanese Pan Noodles, however without protein, as the dosis of carbs fulfills more than the amount of calories I want to alot to lunch. Also, for being a fast food restaurant, a price of 10 dollars is pushing it. On that note, the pricing boards are not the clearest. You find yourself going back and forth between sections just to puzzle together how much you will be paying at the end. This all, no matter how fancy the a-la-carte coke vending machine is. My drink was a blend of strawberry-vanilla sprite zero. I love the fact that Pittsburgh has a trend of getting picked as a test or at least a first wave implementation city for new machines and products. (:-))  I was in line barely ten minutes before my order was filled, which was great, as I was in line behind about 15 people.   I must agree with another fellow yelp-ers review, because this dish was both blan and overspiced. It was overloaded with black pepper and the noodles were scorched from the pan frying process. The carrots, mushrooms and sprouts had no flavor, not even the sweeter sauce flavoring the dish came with. But boy, was there a parsley kick.   I was in an out within 30 minutes, and the place makes me want to come back only when I am craving my noodle comfort food.   I'm going to get technical for a second from a customer flow perspective, but the layout of the place sucks:   First, if you are dining in, the space is petit, laden with various size tables that may or may not be available at lunch time, including long cafeteria-like tables to accommodate more than 6 people, so if you're not at least willing to meet a new lunch companion for the day, you may be out of luck. Second, the common tables are triangular in nature to maximize space, so you may run out of room to set the bowls that are brought to you by a 'server'. This server is also responsible to clearing your dishes, to avoid spacial accomdation for waste bins. Third there is NO counter between the final food station and the customer. This makes we more than nuts because servers, food perparers, cashiers, food itself and customers are all within the same bubble. It may have been there for quick access, however it's turns into a crowd control/sanitation issue.  If you decide to take out, there is no space to accomdate you during your waiting time. If you get there during the big lunch rush, you may find yourself stepping on yourself or other people, including the 'servers' that are flowing back and forth. It's absolutely hopeless, but I don't know if there's much one can do about this.  The best advice to avoid this of course is to avoid the lunch hour, as downtown empties out after 4pm. When I pass the Noodle & Company place in the evening times, there is ample space for you to enjoy your fast noodle meal."}
{"text":"MEH. the food looked like it was slapped on a plate by a disgruntled school cafeteria worker. even worse, everything tasted like it came from a variety box of microwavable hamburger helper packets.  japanese pan noodles: slightly above meh (for use of udon noodles). pad thai: meh. mushroom stroganoff: a really, really low meh.  i really love noodles, man and was disappointed with my experience here.   (also, there was no form of ramen. that's just wrong. wrong!!)"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was the food. We walked in right when the place opened and I'm not exaggerating when I say EVERY table in the place was dirty! The glass on the doors were full of greasy fingerprints and all of the salt and pepper grinders were either broken or filthy. The sriracha bottles were caked with sauce on the nozzles. Also the coolers were not stocked and the front cooler at the counter was still closed. Very disappointing and my family will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst. We ( a family of 4, 2 kids, 2 adults ) went into have dinner at 608pm we ordered our food was brought table at 745pm. The food well when your 5 year old takes her first bite of her favorite meal (mac & cheese) and says first thing after waiting over an hour for food and is starving that her dinner isn't good because it's cold like a popsicle there's a problem. So I tested it yep ice cold. My 8 year old spaghetti...the same ice cold My hubs ordered a meal and a side if soup, soup ice cold, meal luke warm. I ordered a meal and a side salad... salad was literally 5 pieces of lettuce, my meal was luke warm at best.  My 2 kids and I shared my dish while waiting another 15 minutes while waiting for their dishes to to be warmed back up. When my hubs went up to see what again was taking so long the mac and cheese was finished just sitting there getting cold again, and then the person \"cooking\" the speghetti again says it hasn't been started yet because they don't have any spaghetti noodles...so I guess just standing there for 20 minutes gets more noodles? After waiting out for the kids food again my hubs went and said something to the manager he said weren't you warned of the long wait for the food after you ordered....Um no and wouldn't you warn if the wait before the customer orders and pays???  Sure it was dinner time and busy but no more busy then Tokyo joes which has the same ordering concept of ordering and then going to your table with a number and then they bring the food to you. The beverage dispenser out if ice. Out of forks, when we approached a employee to get forks he said the ones he had were for other people then started handing them out to people at tables that had arrived after us. Any how that wasn't even the biggest issue... The ladies restroom was also out of toilet paper when I asked for some the gentleman I asked pawned getting it off to some one else who went to get it which took forever, comes back with hand towels, I said no toilet paper, he says no one tells me anything around here, goes back for another 5 minutes, come back and starts going towards the rest room I said no I can just take it and put it I there there's a line of 6 ladies now waiting to use the bathroom at the rate Flash McHussle moves at it would have taken an hour to put it in there. Seriously I wouldn't even give this place one star but then I can't leave a review"}
{"text":"I tried Noodles & Co after receiving a buy one get one free coupon in the mail. I'm never a big fan of getting noodles out, but they had a nice selection to choose from as it was not all Italian inspired.   I got the shrimp green Thai curry. It's on the seasonal menu, but I hope it stays. It had the right amount of spice, but a sweetness that came from the pineapple mixed in. The flavors complimented each other well and I felt that it was from a true sit down restaurant vs fast casual. I enjoyed the dish so much that I came back a week later and got it again!   It's a little pricey than most fast casuals ($9-$12 per meal), but the noodle bowls are nice size. I should of had leftovers, but it was too good to not eat at once ;-)"}
{"text":"It's okay Pasta. Over price for what you can make at home for cheaper. Same with appetizers. It's all over price and can be easily made at home for one third the price. The best part is the soda machine. Customer service is okay. Not the nicest but sassy. It's okay."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I had never been to one of these (Franchise). But its setup pretty cool. You pick a serving size. type of noodle and protein to add and they cook and serve. The prices weren't bad at all either. There were a lot of people ordering the Wisconsin mac and cheese I may have to try that the next time. Id definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time. Ordered stroganoff noodles, they were over cooked, virtually no meat and a small portion for what they charge. The sauce was very bland and watery. Wife had Japanese noodles, under cooked , cold and again minimal chicken and portion. She also got a small salad, size of a tea cup. $19.62  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Decent. I agree with other reviewers that noodles are a little dry. I ordered the Pesto Cavatappi and it could've used more Pesto. If it didn't have delicious parmesan crusted chicken in it, I probably would've asked for more sauce. I got a kids Mac and cheese too and it wasn't bad (I had a bite of my daughters ). Both meals were $12, so all in all eating here wasn't a bad choice. Nothing great though either."}
{"text":"Great place for anyone who loves pasta. I had the mac n cheese and it was delicious. Lots of options to make your meal unique"}
{"text":"Emma is great! We came in at 7:35 ordered and received our food in about 5 mins! We were driving back from the mountain hike after getting lost bc no service and were starvingggg. Found this place on yelp on the road back and never ate at a place like this before.   Emma explained everything to us and helped us order. I have bad eyesight bc my dermatologist kinda sucks and gave me the wrong contact prescription) but Emma handed me a menu so I didn't have to squint my eyes at the big main menu. She even explained to us how we could get a free rice krispy wedge or chocolate chip cookie by signing up for the rewards program (which we did of course).   I was craving Thai food but didn't rly trust how good they could mimic the curry or pad thai so I got a light option of the pasta fresca when I should've gotten something with a thicker sauce bc it was kinda too plain for my liking. The Mac and cheese was a little too plain for my liking too but my bff liked it even though he didn't order chicken (bc he forgot to). Overall it wasn't too great but there was quick food and great, kind customer service!"}
{"text":"Only reason I ate here was because MAC's nearby was packed and had a 25 min wait for food and I was going to a movie across the street in about 30 minutes.  I'm usually content with the pesto cavatapi at noodles but it took 15+ minutes for a small order with grilled chicken, and it was all cold. Atleast there was a decent portion of chicken I guess."}
{"text":"My sig other & I come to this Noodles at least weekly. I think it's ran fairly well, but a lot of times they are slow to bus tables and the outside eating area tables are always dirty. Otherwise, it's great."}
{"text":"I am mixed on my feelings. On one hand I like the variety, the ability to customize one's bowl and the low \"base\" prices. My main complain is even with a \"large\" but mostly empty bowl I am not satisfied. Given the low cost of pasta I am surprised. When I tried the added tofu it was good but 5 small chunks were not worth the cost."}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed my BBQ pork Mac and cheese a lot. There was enough cheese and protein to fill me for two meals! The flavor was exactly what I was hoping for: BBQ and Cheese. I came in for lunch, had a short wait, and a satisfied meal."}
{"text":"we eat here almost once a week. service is awesome, portions are just right, and the management team is on point. keep it up!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant I think N & C delivers a consistently good menu and value.  We are always pleased.  However, I want to review service at the N & C on Mineral Point Blvd. in particular.  The situation.... Sunday 1:15 p.m. , post church crowd, Christmas shopping crowd across from West Towne Mall.  It was BUSY.  I don't think I have ever been to a N & C when they were this slammed.  The line was to the door, few if any tables, and the wait and kitchen staff were amazing.  I don't think anyone had to wait more than 5 to 8 minutes for their food.  My wife and I were totally impressed.  And, perhaps it was the Christmas spirit, but all the customers seemed to take the line and table wait in stride.  Some folks even shared tables with strangers.  Very nice indeed.   Way to hustle and kudos to the N & C staff!"}
{"text":"Been waiting forever for this place to finally open. They have several locations, but I've never been to Noodles & Company, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was an Asian noodle place, and boy was I wrong - well, sorta.  It's a fast food noodle place where you choose your main dish, regular ($5.89) or small size (just under $5), and then you have the option of adding meat (because almost none of the dishes come with meat, except the uniquely priced items) or a side. After adding a meat, the price of the dish essentially equals the price of one of the uniquely priced dishes, so it's actually not as cheap as it seems unless you're a vegetarian.   I was disappointed by the options. I expected more. The selection also seemed very random. They have Asian dishes like Pad Thai, Spicy Korean Beef Noodles, and Bangkok Curry. They also have Italian dishes like Penne Rosa, Pesto Cavatappi, and Spaghetti & Meatballs. I felt very confused and unsure of what to order. I had a Small Alfredo MontAmore (spaghetti noodles, Alfredo, roasted mushrooms, tomato, spinach, and Parmesan chicken, $7.49). The chicken was too salty, but the rest tasted alright. Portion size was perfect. Also sampled a Regular Pad Thai ($5.89) with Shrimp ($2.99 extra) plus a side of Thai Curry ($1.50). The rice noodles in the Pad Thai should have been cooked longer. The eggs were very ribbon-like in texture, which made the dish look different than typical Pad Thai. The Thai Curry was bland, except for the mushrooms. The aromatic scent was there, but not the flavor. It was as if all the flavor had absorbed into the small slices of mushroom and nothing else. Very small bowl.  It'd be awesome to be able to customize your order, like a noodle version of Subway or Chipotle, but overall, not bad for a fast food noodle place."}
{"text":"Ive tried a couple of things here, but my favorite is the thai hot pot. It is sooooo good! The place is clean and the staff are friendly. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"This is one of those great places where you can get something quick and healthy at the same time.  My biggest beef is with the lack of veggies!  When you order an Asian noddle dish, of course the main part is noodles but can you please make it with more than two mushrooms, two pieces of broccoli and 3 little slivers of carrot????  I like my veggies and I think it is extremely dissatisfying to order a meal and have it look like we had a major loss in our vegetable crops and they are being rationed out to last the winter.  When you pay $30 bucks for two people to eat a bowl of noddles you should get more than noodles (they cost way less we get it), however I just forked out $15/person and expect to see some veggies darn it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is among my favorites in Oakland. Wide range of choices on menu + tasty dishes + healthy foods + quick services + reasonable price... wow, it is almost PERFECT for me (well, at least for now, when it's still new and exciting)! One thing to note is that their portion size is quite small! I would usually go for their \"trio\", with small size noodle choice + meat + salad."}
{"text":"We have been to many of these restaurants in CO and the one in Tempe with no issues and have really liked them. However, 2 of the 3 times we have been to this one we have come away disappointed. One time almost no sauce in one dish and this time onions in the Mac and cheese. Ruined the meal. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"My office just moved to the South End and unfortunately for me not many places serve lunch after 2/2:30 around here, but Noodles does!  Is it the best food I've ever had?  No, but it is decent and consistent and not too hard on the wallet.   The service here is incredibly nice, like the girl almost scared me she was sooo friendly!  So for those days when I eat later than the rest of the population, at least I know I have a decent option just 2 minutes away!"}
{"text":"I can't judge their in store dining. I order online through their website and am always in/out In 1 to 2 minutes or less. Great restaurant, quick food, great service. Probably the best fast food casual in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service was fast and courteous, but the food was far from great. Noodles were cold and didn't seem fresh. Mac and cheese was pretty tasteless and seemed to be precooked and microwaved. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Curiosity finally settled. After many drive by's and wonderment...I finally decided to break from the norm and stop in. I usually pass by the Noodles & Company off of Ray & the 10...but the N&C I visited was among 1,500 different restaurants & fast food spots in Gilbert! (Not really 1,500).   Typical nouveau style...which was expected. Again, because this place was surrounded among a foodies paradise, when I stopped in...it wasn't crowded at all. However the menu was far from typical. A great simple selection of pastas and noodles. Now I know, there are many \"house\" made....mom & pop....hole in the wall noodle and pasta joints....but this is sorta food fast...or fast food, so settle down. I would say there was something for everyone. Staff was friendly and service was good.   Now....surprisingly the food was really good! I gave it 3 stars but its more closer to 4. Noodles tasted fresh and not over or under-seasoned. Anyways...I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"I have to give them props for helping me when I need catering done (and they deliver on large orders).  I have eaten here probably 10 times and I like the pad thai (average - needs more spice - notice I did not say I love it).  The Med Salad is good with chicken and the Mac & Cheese is awesome!!  I always get the large bowl.  I give them the \"A-OK\" 3 stars for food and gave them one extra star for their catering - makes my job much easier....  Oh, and for lunch, it is a nice change of pace from Qdoba, Panera, McAlisters and such..."}
{"text":"I might have found a new addiction. I can't count the number of times I visited Noodles and Company while I was in Madison. I loved it so much that I emailed them to see if they would open one in Auburn. Only time will tell.  I really only tried their Asian menu. I tried the Japanese udon noodles and the Vietnamese peanut saute, with the later being my favorite. I've had the Pad Thai in the past- when I lived in Columbia MO, and I remember that being excellent as well.  It is fast food but really doesn't feel like it. The food comes to you after you are seated in fine white china. Everything I've tried has been wonderfully made and essentially everything on their menu is vegetarian. You can add a protein if you desire. The only blah item was the Flatbread.   I have visited three different locations in Madison. This one is a bit smaller than the one on University but it is still great. The employees keep the tables clean and are always willing to help.  I love Noodles. I know I'll be back a few more times before headed back to my village of Auburn."}
{"text":"noodles is a chain-type place that specializes in...well, noodles? its a bit overpriced for the portion size but the mac and cheese and the tomato bisque are well worth it!   the asian entrees are pretty good faux clones - and the few bites of the italian and american noodle dishes i've had are pretty good too. it's a great place to grab a bite in the campustown area if you want to be sure you'll have a good meal."}
{"text":"Had some pretty good preset options, essential a Chipotle for your noodle bowls. Tried the Pesto Cavatappi which was surprisingly cheesy, could've used a bit more pesto. Took the board's suggestion and added shredded pork - the board was right it was definitely a good combination with the noodles. Service was good and quick even at lunch rush. My wife tried one of the Asian noodle bowls, had a nice mix of beef, sprouts, mushrooms and sauce. If you are in a pinch for time and love noodles, definitely suggest you swing here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the valley! I used to live in Houston and lived near a Noodles & Company and I ate there almost every week! The prices are fair for a lot of food of top quality. There are so many options to choose from and their ingredients are always so fresh! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"In the midst of an ever increasing obesity epidemic corporate America brings you Noodles & Company.   Japanese pan noodles with steak Pad Thai with shrimp Pot stickers  22.04  Interesting menu. OUTSTANDING decor. Incredibly polite staff (loved them!)  The place was packed at 8pm  They must be doing something right, right? Wrong. The customers are doing something wrong.  Everything was overpriced. Everything was OK, which is the goal of any restaurant owned by shareholders... don't take chances, mediocre is safe.  Hopefully diners in the valley will start supporting privately-owned restaurants and stop with the bland, overpriced corporate cuisine featured  by our friends at Noodles & Company.  P.S. I deducted a star for charging 2.79 for six ridiculously small shrimp."}
{"text":"We stopped by and had the Japanese Pan Noodle dish with steak and potstickers. It was delicious! Fast, good and to go boxes readily available. Our first time here and we were pleasantly surprised. A variety of meats and tofu are on the menu. Mac and cheese was really good too!"}
{"text":"New restaurant on Market Street, directly next to Habit Burger Grill in Costco shopping plaza. Food was delicious, portion size on the small entrée was on the smaller side - especially on the Pad Thai. Would recommend up-sizing to a large.   Dining room was nice with modern decor and self-serve beverage and condiment counter. Staff was friendly & seemed eager to please. I gave it a 4/5 due to the portion size."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I have been here twice and have been impressed with the friendliness and freshness of the food.  They also post calorie count so you can make smart choices.  My kids like the spaghetti and today I had had the Japanese noodle bowl and it was delish."}
{"text":"Things are better now that they have the \"bowls\" - a good amount of protein, simple list of ingredients. Decent value for good amount of food."}
{"text":"I've been to the Noodle Company in Market Square a couple times for lunch this month, including last Monday.  It's one of those places where you order at the register, get your own table, they give you a number and bring you the food.  My experiences here have overall been fairly good  though the restaurant does get packed around lunch time. But, it's downtown. What do you expect?  Luckily, there was an open table for me and my companions both times I came this past month, but I recently learned that they've stopped in before and there were no open tables. On to what I like about it: The selection and combinations. And did I mention carbs,carbs, carbs.  You basically pick the way you want your pasta prepared and can choose a meat, shrimp or tofu to add.  The first time I had Japanese Pan Noodles with parmesan chicken- not the best flavor combination but I should have known better. Last Monday, I decided to play it a little safer and go with the Bangkok Curry with  plain Chicken.  This was a much better choice. My co-workers feel that the mac and cheese dishes are much better than teh asian dishes. In addition, the service has been fast, the dishes I ordered came out within 5-10 minutes.   They also have one of the new fountain drink machines where you can pretty much get any soft drink you can think of, including some flavors I haven't heard of before. Last time, I tried Diet Vanilla Coke just to try it.  It frankly wasn't very good but hey, next time I can try one of the other 200 flavor combinations. So, if you are headed to Noodles & Company for lunch I would suggest that if it's busy when you come in and there's an open table, send someone in the group to take the table and order for them."}
{"text":"I love Noodles & Company, but this location is just not great in terms of food quality. Today I had the penne Rosa with chicken and the pasta was luke warm with cold chunks of feta cheese. There were also pan noodles, pad thai, and cavatapi noodles mixed in."}
{"text":"My noodles were just fine. I got the Japanese curry dish, featuring rice noodles. It was kind of bland; I thought it would be spicy but the only heat came from the peppers. Definitely the highlight of the meal was the fancy soda machine that allows you to mix flavors into sodas. It's fine for a quick cheap meal, so can't complain."}
{"text":"Color me... meh. I've had a couple of their Asian noodle dishes and mostly I feel as though they're barely ok, no flavors that pop out at you, nothing interesting to write home to Yelp about.  Maybe there's not much better for Asian food in downtown (oh Sukhothai, how we miss you!) but most of the time, I think I'd rather get a different cuisine for lunch and then go to a better Asiany place for dinner.  Also, given the portion size, please do yourself a favor and do NOT look up the calorie count for their dishes. It will definitely shock you."}
{"text":"This location makes everything I love about Noodles & Co. disappear. Terrible service, inability to get an order straight and an awful parking lot. There's a Chipotle right across the street and a Panera right down the road.....both exceptional. There is no way this location will last. If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Quick service, great taste, and LOTS of cruelty-free vegan menu choices--what's not to love!?!  Even better, it's about a ten-second walk from a HUGE Tesla Supercharger station!  Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY NO FLAVOR! The dishes sound good, but they all taste the same. I never waste food, but I had to throw the entire meal out. I was afraid that I would anger my animals if I gave it to them."}
{"text":"As someone who tries to eat healthy I really enjoy this place; whenever we go to the arboretum my family prefers to eat at five guys and I enjoy picking something from here to accompany them. The best part is, you can ask for your choice to be prepared as a salad."}
{"text":"2 stars for the idea. After that it was pretty much downhill. Had the japanese noodles with microscopic shrimp.  Not hot and totally dry.  The dining room was slow and the service was awful.  Ordered the Thai soup there was barely any broth. Everyone else's dish was fairly adequate but not much sauce and not too hot."}
{"text":"Love this company and was introduced to them in Denver when we went to visit. Our family up there recommended it to us and we've always gone each visit!  Now that it's in the valley I am so happy! I can't say anything about the ambience or eating in the restaurant as we've only gotten takeout. It's alway pretty good and the takeout is tasty! Our daughter is a toddler and very active and I would rather eat it at home! But the food tastes great and it's worth it to me or my husband to grab this on those nights or days we don't have the energy to cook a meal! We like the macaroni and cheese and pad Thai !"}
{"text":"First time eating here.. I really wanted the korean  I believe but didn't want it to be too spicey but they told me it is pre-made which was a bummer. I got something else instead and it was good but it could have been so much better.  It was simply too plain. Mostly noodles and not enough toppings such as broccoli carrots etc and definitely could have added more meat they didn't give me too much and so my meal was kind of boring and really could have ended differently if they didn't charge so much and then gave me so little. If I want to eat just noodles I might as well save all my money and make a ramen...seriously"}
{"text":"This place just opened and I was a big fan after eating there only a couple times. Definitely give it a chance of your looking for something quick and fairly priced. My last meal there came out and the noodles were not cooked all the way. As you can imagine, that wasn't very appetizing. I told the manager about it, but was in a hurry so did not accept the new plate that was offered. In return she gave me a couple \"free bowl\" coupons for next time. It was handled well. I appreciated the coupons and definitely plan to eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"Cute little place, newish to Ahwatukee. I wasn't prepared for the open ordering but going with the flow. Big boards with all of the items they offer, kind of like Chipotle... I found it refreshing that you had a choice with your noodles. Some were Italian style, some Chinese, some just great mixes of flavors. Seems like a great place to go when everyone can't come to a collective decision on what they want to eat. I ordered the truffle Mac. I expected it to be somewhat cheesey but it wasn't. More like truffle oil and button mushrooms. Breadcrumbs were scattered on the top. It was just ok. My daughter ordered Mediterranean expecting to me like a macaroni salad and it wasn't. Iced tea was so watery too... Food was served promptly and staff was nice and friendly. Not a fan. Good for a quick meal or lunch."}
{"text":"YUM! This place is small but quickly efficient. Their sauce was delish and pasta was cooked to perfection. Don't be afraid to try new things. Expand your taste buds and choose something different and exciting. You can't go wrong with any dish on this menu!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place as we love noodle delight in Scarborough. Big disappointment. The large size noodles is so over priced and so tiny in portions. I was hoping to have leftovers but was still hungry after eating half that I ate the rest. Boring unfulfilling flavours, feels like I could've had a similar meal for $1.99 from a frozen dinner. Will not be going back agin, tried it twice and was not thrilled with the food taste or quality either time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a Tuesday about 3:00.  Not busy.  Order was taken right away and served promptly.  There were people at one other table and I believe 4 people on staff.  I was amazed at how dirty the place was.  The noon rush was over and there were tables yet to be bussed and the floor was a big mess.  If the front of the house looks that bad, what's the back look like?  I was not impressed.  Also, I am a guy and this restaurant appeals more to women than to guys.  Maybe women wouldn't be so critical.  Please clean the place up.  Also, the prices are too high.  I'll be back only when my wife drags me back in kicking and screaming."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick and easy dinner with our toddler. Staff was super nice, friendly and energetic. No MSG in the food which is a huge plus. We ended up getting the Wisconsin Mac and cheese and the stroganoff.   The Mac and Cheese was pretty amazing, I don't usually go for mac and cheese but I will definitely order it again. My husband liked the stroganoff a lot also. It must've been good because even the 1 1/2 year old ate it.  I would recommend checking this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've made 2 attempts at giving this place a chance.   My first attempt was a few days after their grand opening. I ordered their Alfredo MontAmore dish.  This dish was extremely underwhelming. Very dry. Noodles stuck together. Wasn't even sure I got the right dish at first as there was no Alfredo sauce to be found. Upon seeing very little Alfredo at the bottom of the bowl I figured it was the right order. I ordered the dish with grilled chicken and added shrimp. Both the shrimp and chicken were EXTREMELY dry just like the noodles were  My second visit was just as disappointing as the first. If not more. This time I opted for the Pad Thai. Again, the noodles were so dry that I could stick my fork in them and pull out every single noodle which was stuck together in one large lump. I had a terrible time trying to pull them all apart to make them edible. I got the dish with shrimp and, again, I wasn't surprised to find the shrimp extremely dry. It was supposed to have fried egg in the dish as well but I found maybe 3 or 4 small pieces of egg. Not even anything that would be considered a full egg. They topped it with 2 soggy sprigs of cilantro and a tiny dry shriveled up lime wedge which I was unable to get any lime juice out of in an attempt to moisturize my dry noodles. There was no taste of peanuts...possibly due to the fact they forgot to add them. And there was no taste of sweet chili.   I think it's safe to say I won't be returning and unfortunately, unless this company can really do a complete 180 turnaround and fix all the issues people are complaining about, they won't stand a chance and will be having to close their doors soon..."}
{"text":"I got the Bangkok Curry w/ shrimp it was really good going down, I gave it 3 stars because I got sick, don't know if it was from the food or the pill I took for my headache. I will be trying it again though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some people I work with.  They do a really good job with putting the menu not just behind the registers, but also right after you walk in o you can decide what you want while you are in line.  They have one of those Coke machines that let you customize your drink, but a lot of the flavors were not working when I was there.  There is a lot of seating which is nice since this location is in an area that gets really crowded at lunch time.  The food itself was not bad.  I had Indonesian Peanut Sauté with chicken.  It came with a fresh lime, I thought that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great pasta.  Not a super upscale place, so it's nice to come here and get a quick bite that serves more upscale dishes.  Great for lunch, dinner, with a group of friends or coworkers as well as by yourself."}
{"text":"I came here when this location first opened in Tempe and it was awesome. I recommended it to my friends and even drove out here a few times from the West Valley to have some Noodles! Now, I don't think I would make a special trip here and I only live a few miles away. The food is still pretty good quality. I had the new thai curry bowl which was flavorful but the shrimp was a wasted add on. My boyfriend had the korean bowl and he said the spice level was good but was lacking flavor beyond that. I got the curry soup on the side and I do have to admit that it was pretty fantastic! If you're a curry fan then I'd recommend trying it. We also got two snickerdoodles. These were OK but, in my opinion, doughy and under cooked (who knows if they actually bake them in house, though?).   As for the service... I agree with other reviews saying the employees aren't friendly. I honestly don't think I saw a single employee crack a smile. They forgot my cookies (ordered online) so I walked back in a few minutes later and asked. Someone told me, \"Yeah, just grab them.\" Which is fine... I don't need help grabbing them.. but the way she said it was just rude. I felt like a major burden!   All in all: Hoping this location increases moral somehow because it's depressing in there, honestly. Tasty food for the most part so the cooks can keep doin' what they're doin'. :-)"}
{"text":"Food is fine but the staff all argue and the wait time is ridiculous..... ordered one meal to go and waited 35 minutes, wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The prices were high, food quality was low. The meat was tough, food was lacking salt. I'm a small person, and the booths were uncomfortably tiny. This is not a place I will go again."}
{"text":"This place is very good if you love pasta. There's a lot of variety from Pad Thai to Pasta with Pesto sauce. I love the downtown location because sometimes I want pasta for lunch and this is certainly the answer. I wish they had Mancini's rolls but that's just because I'm a fan of theirs. The employees are nice and the portions are appropriate. I'll certainly go back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"What happened to the Parmesan chicken?!....I ordered Penne Rosa with the chicken, and it was so rubbery.....The texture was like chicken, I couldn't eat.....Really disappointed"}
{"text":"I was sooooo disappointed when they closed Noodles & Company in Monroeville.   I was soooo happy to find another at South Hills Village Mall.   I just can't say enough about Noodles. I love everything about this chain restaurant.   I have NEVER had a bad experience or a bad meal. They have also always accommodated my special need in changing noodle type on a meal.  Just LOVE this restaurant.   I do t find the catering g to be worth it, but having a meal most definitely."}
{"text":"Disappointed   I was excited to see a Noodles and Company restaurant  and was looking foward to dining at the restaurant. Today, my co-workers and I decided to give into our curiousty and have lunch at Noodles and Company.  The restaurant was packed, and the patrons appeared to be enjoying their entrée's. The menu at Noodles and Company is tricky to read, since it is printed on the wall. The menu includes 4 Italian noodle dishes, 4 Asian noodle dishes, 4 American noodle dishes, 4 soups, 4 salads, and 4 sandwiches, and most dishes are offered in both small and large sizes.  I ordered the steak stroganoff, and my co workers had the Pad Thai and Chicken Noodle Soup. We both agreed that the stroganoff didn't quite taste like stroganoff and the Pad Thai not quite like Pad Thai.  The beef in the strofanoff was a little fatty and the noodles tased somewhat greasy.  I really didnt care for the taste and my co-workers thought their entrée's,  were just okay, nothing was outstanding or stood out.   The portions at Noodles and Company can be misleading.  Our large bowls appeared big but were only half full. The service at Noodles and Company is quick and the staff is friendly.  If you are craving something besides a burger it's okay, but don't set your hopes too high."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit and have been going to the downtown restaurant to get Japanese pan noodles regularly since last year - I'd say once or twice a week. I noticed that in the past five months or so, the portions of the food are dwindling: less noodles, less veggies, even less condiments in to go containers. The company must be cutting back on expenses, but that means they will be cutting customers as well. Need to buy a second lunch now.  P.S., It's been two months since I wrote the above review and I haven't been back once. Found a great alternative noodles restaurant - Yuzu Kitchen. The food is much better."}
{"text":"Ooooh i had the spicy korean beef noodles and it was bombbbb the one with udon noodles was o k  The cups were a bot scratched up and one had a lipstick stain ): but other than that great foood ahh"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this location because it used to be great, but my last few orders have been a lot less flavorful than they used to be. My friends have noticed this as well. Feels like they're skimping on their sauce :( used to go all the time but probably won't be back"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good meal. I had the pesto Cavatappi Curly pasta, basil pesto, garlic, mushrooms, tomato, cream and parmesan. I added grilled chicken for the protein. The cost was right around $10, if I remember correctly. The portion was big, so big that I couldn't finish it. The noodles were a bit too al dente for me and in my opinion, could have used just a couple of more minutes cooking. Overall this was a pretty tasty meal.  I found the menu to be quite extensive which was great for everyone in our party. On our table we had spaghetti and meat balls, a Thai meal (I had a bite and it was spicy!), a shrimp plate, a salad and mac and cheese. If an establishment can accommodate that many tastes, that's a plus all around!   Everything that was delivered to our table looked fresh and was presented nicely. I don't thank any one of us finished it all. I know we had at least three to go boxes that went into the car with us.   The dining room was clean, but our table has food under it and my guess is that there was a kid eating there before us. Not a big deal, it didn't really deter from our experience.   A group of us went and we put a couple of tables together, so yes, larger groups can be accommodated. I might return, but for me pasta is a pure indulgence."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff - voluntarily explains menu, brings food and clears table.  Food was better than expected for price."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It was very good. The Spicy Korean Beef Noddles was very DELICIOUS!  I'm coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good!   Ordered chicken Caesar salad and a side of mac n cheese. My guy ordered the Penne Rosa, and my son the kid's spaghetti and meatballs.   Noodles were cooked perfectly, cheese sauce was a bit lacking but still tasty. The salad was good, but nothing special. The Penne Rosa was very flavorful and the chicken was also good.   Extremely courteous and helpful staff, the tea had run out and I brought it to their attention. A gentleman walked right over and brewed some more on the spot!  The only thing keeping this place from a 5 star rating was the prices. They're not outrageous, but a bit on the high side for the portions."}
{"text":"I believe in 2nd and even 3rd chances, but this location has repeatedly disappointed me over the past year. If there were no stars, I would pick that. In general, the noodles are not tasty and are extremely overpriced. As other reviews have pointed out, cleanliness is an issue. Also, the staff are young college students. Most are nice but some are extremely nasty, particularly on the phone. I ordered once and the person on the phone had the nerve to immediately say I have no time for this within 10 seconds of me explaining my order to her. Seriously, have some respect for your customers! In addition to lousy customer service, I have been consistently overcharged and given the wrong order. Comparing prices when ordering online to what it rings up at the register, my orders are typically $2-4 more expensive at the register and the lousy staff are not able to explain the discrepancy even though I always get takeout. That's just ridiculous. Again, I tried to give them another chance and voiced my complaints to their manager, but apparently that does nothing. This location deserves no stars. I will NEVER go back to this location again. Thank you Noodles and Company for forcing me out of your business.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"Daniella & Tom had the best customer service love the food nice and hot great vibe... I will be recommending this place to everyone.... nice prices too"}
{"text":"My visit today was not very pleasant. I have been to this establishment many times and always order the Penne Rosa with parmesean crusted chicken. Today when I went they were very busy so I understand the long wait. However, they had to ask my what my order was 2 different times and when I finally got my food (I ordered togo) and got home I had received the small order of pasta when I ordered the regular and my chicken was in a little bowl on the side VERY overcooked! This was my first meal of the day so I wasn't very happy with what I received."}
{"text":"A nice meal.   Enjoyed the Japanese pan noodles and Thai green curry with shrimp.    Staff was pleasant and helpful.   Potstickers were great also."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. The whole grain Tuscan Fresca was just some noodles, olive oil, a few tomatoes and 4 leaves of spinach. The only redeeming aspects of this meal were the the feta cheese, the beer, and that I was able to order a small size portion. I might come back to this place if it's Sunday and Chik-Fil-A is closed."}
{"text":"Had such a positive experience at this Noodles & Co. today. Holidays got me exhausted and I really just wanted someone else to cook a meal for me. I placed my order for myself and my wife and daughter for takeout, got the bag, and when I walked out to my car and opened up the car door my bag ripped and I lost everything to the ground. The bag rip was user error (I wasn't holding it from the bottom line I should have been and the top of the bag tore away). I went back in with the remnants, not really knowing what the staff could do for me... not only did they rush a new order for me, but I didn't have to pay for the new order. I am so grateful for the staff at this Noodles & Co. for their understanding and generosity. I'm sure this may have furrowed a few brows behind the counter - understandably so - but they were very nice to me and provided me with a great meal. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Just another regular noodles place.  Not shockingly awesome menu. They did not add / remove items since ~1.5 years, so pretty sad on that.  Ambience is not great, tables weren't clean. Price range is decent. Ordered - Japanese pan noodles - tasted good. Sriracha added to it, made best dinner ever. Got a regular portion and good for one meal.  I would just recommend this place, if you don't know what to eat..lol"}
{"text":"This is my favorite noodle spot in Charlotte...haven't really bothered checking for another one. But I absolutely love this place. Been a regular for about 7 years. They're delicious and quick as well as they have an amazing staff. The owner is always accommodating. Food menu also includes the young pasta lovers as well....can't beat that. DOWNLOAD the app...great deals and freebies"}
{"text":"Delicious and I'm hoping that the one closer to me is just as good. I had the Spicy Chicken Caesar flatbread and chicken noodle soup. We also had the potstickers, two kids meals (mac and spag and mballs) and Penne Rosa. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. The kids were happy to share their broccoli and that was well cooked and seasoned. And the service was really good. I will be visiting the one near me soon. Hope it's as good!"}
{"text":"Very convenient location as it is right on the PATH. I like the fact that you can get takeout and the fact that it is a fusion restaurant - you can order Japanese, Thai or Italian here! I also appreciated that there is table service, given its location. I've had the Japanese pan noodles and the buff Bangkok curry. The buff Bangkok curry was really good! I really like how you're able to make some options healthier by making it \"buff\" (i.e. adding raw spinach to your dish). I didn't find anything special about the Japanese pan noodles. I found the Japanese pan noodles to taste no different from something that you can get for less at Teriyaki Experience. Overall, great place to get lunch - unique menu, food is prepared really quickly, great location for those who can access the PATH easily."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price but not without its shortcomings.  My daughter had the Mac and Cheese which was a decent portion of fresh noodles with butter and grated cheese sprinkled on top.  After some stirring it was good but hardened cold in a few minutes.  My Thai dish was excellent with lots of veggies and flavor.     My big issue with this place is how dingy it is.   The place needs to be cleaned top to bottom.  Windows, walls and floors.   All tables were empty but half looked like they were barely clean.  The 4 employees standing around could have been put to good use with sponges and cleaner.     I'll be back but it will be to go."}
{"text":"The staff needs customer service training but the food is on par with other locations. I am hoping they are still just working out the kinks since it's new."}
{"text":"A different type of semi-fast, fast food. Lots of tasty choices to pick from like my fav Chick Pad-Tai. Noodles done differently as across the globe. Italian, Swedish, Asian, soups & salads.   Fresh as you can get a quick meal. 8-9 bucks gets you some meat on a typical dish.   Overall a good clean place."}
{"text":"How excited was I that Noodles & Company opened at Tempe Market Place?! I nearly fell out of my chair when I read the announcement. In college this was my go to place for a quick and cheap meal (or two if you buy the larger size and save some for later). They are really fairly priced for great portion sizes. There is a noodle dish for whatever mood you might be in on a particular day. My personal favorite is the Whole Grain Tuscan Fresca (whole grain linguine with balsamic, olive oil, white wine and roasted garlic, red onion, tomato, spinach, parmesan and Italian parsley). You can also add soup and/or salad to round out your meal."}
{"text":"The employees are invariably lackadaisical, unwelcoming, and distracted. I try to avoid Noodles if I can. Their food is obviously just whatever fast food. But I really love that they have corkscrew pasta.  A positive of Noodles is that they can provide you with information on what is vegan and what is not (and how to modify certain dishes to make them vegan). I don't particularly like their vegan options, but if I had to choose, I would go with a dairy-free Penne Rosa with tofu."}
{"text":"OH MY GOOD! Asian AND Italian food is genius! Because I love both! Tuscan Fresca Noodles were fantastic! I wish I would've got the regular size bowl instead. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Would be so much better if they did not cook the cheap pasta into mush. I want to like it,  tried to get them to cook Al dante, but they refused. That makes them a Fast food outlet, no more. Better option would be Sala Thai."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Food tasted stale. I'm guessing the toppings (chicken, shrimp) are simply defrosted and places on the noodles or rice. Even the veggies tasted watery."}
{"text":"Noodles... oh how I have gone out of my way for you.  First had you in Minnesota in Jan '04, then took a 150 mile detour to go back.  Driving to Far East San Diego to eat you.  Now driving to South End from University City.  The service here was great, almost too good - almost over the top.  I love the new urbanist-esque integration into a mixed-use (if i remember right) building.  Clean and orderly inside and with outdoor seating.  Serves beer & wine, huge pluses!  The only problem and why you are 3/5 stars right now is that my Pasta Fresca was a huge disappointment.  Very low on spinach, onions, cheese, and tomatoes (almost forgot they were there).  And most egregious of all, the sauce -- primarily balsamic vinegar based -- was so minimal that I felt I was just eating plain pasta.  Not sure what to do at this point.  I've eaten this dish every time I've gone and, while it varies, it is usually on point.  Not sure if it is just this location, or because I got the meal for free since it was my b-day (I know beggars shouldn't be choosers -- but still!).  I'll definitely give it another try, but maybe I'll give up on my long running -- 7 years! -- love affair with the Pasta Fresco."}
{"text":"I just walked into the restaurant with my husband to order dinner and a young child threw up behind us in line. When a fellow patron waiting for her food let a woman working there know, she turned to her manager who did nothing. A 2nd person notified the manager and in the rudest response he said, \"Yeah, I know, but we're busy right now.\" There were two other people in line & this should be your 1st priority. Needless to say, we left. We won't be going back to a restaurant that would let a potential health hazard like this go unaddressed."}
{"text":"Cheap eats close to the Capitol If you have a finicky eater who prefers chain restaurants that he recognizes, this is within walking distance of the Capitol. Parking is a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"I give Noodles 5 stars for consistency and flavor.  I had the Indonesian noodle bowl and it was really good.  I am not much for chain restaurants but I didn't have a lot of time and Noodles was close.  Their service is good too.  Noodles is probably the most consistent thing in my life."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Noodles in my time, and this one did not meet the normal standards I have grown to enjoy.  My wife's spicy chipotle with adobo was room temperature.  I don't even mean luke warm - it wasn't any version of warm.  I had the spicy beef Korean noodles, and while mine was appropriately warm - you really need to cut up the cilantro.  I love cilantro, but not when it's a 6\" full piece that's impossible to navigate.  Really?  They lost another star because overall, the place wasn't that busy but was *really* dirty.  The floor was dirty, tables were dirty....ugh.  I hope they get their act together soon - I love N&C but would not go back to this one."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we absolutely loved it! Fast, friendly service and delicious food! We'll definitely be back. My kids said it's their new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Yum! So happy Arizona finally has a Noodles! The service is fast and the food is delicious. Our toddler can't get enough of the mac n cheese. The Indonesian Peanut Saute is delicious! We've been there more times than I'd like to admit since they opened a few weeks ago! They prices are also very affordable - sign up for their email list for coupons!"}
{"text":"First visit and I am planning on going again.  Not a very big place but interesting menu. Food was not great but good enough to try one more time. Wil update"}
{"text":"we had a coupon for BYGO, and although chains are not our first pick, why not give it a try.   the concept is not just asian noodles, but noodle dishes showcased from other regions. you order at the counter, and they just kinda add stuff like a buffet of noodle-ness.   this review is late, so i'm don't quite remember what i ate, but it was the thick japanese noodles. it was a little dry for my palate, but they have siracha and soy sauce to spice things up if you need it.   price point is very reasonable. quick too, so if you're in a rush for a good meal, this is another great option in the tempe marketplace area."}
{"text":"2.5 - This place has been open for a couple of months now and I have been meaning to give them a try. There are two good points I will make about them - the online ordering and the customer service are both really good. I decided to go with the Japanese Pan Noodles sans meat and mushrooms (got red peppers in lieu). You can do all the customizing online and you just walk up to the pick-up counter at the time you specified.  Honestly, I enjoyed the side-salad much more than the noodles. I got the regular size noodles based on reviews about how small the small is and based on the 31kms I ran yesterday lol. It seems like a waste to go with a small for a 1.60 difference in price.  It came with a good amount of noodles and decent amount of carrots, peppers, and bean sprouts, lacking on the broccoli however. The flavour was just OK, which is why this is a 2.5, the noodles taste fresh (as udon noodles can taste I suppose). It was kind of spicy, kind of salty, just nothing special. Perhaps I should have gone with a normal pasta dish and then would have been happier, but now I am unsure if I would even go back. The prices are pretty normal for takeout food in the financial district. Maybe if I am having a major pasta craving and will return but for now, I don't foresee it happening."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Noodles and Company for YEARS and have been of many others.. This is still the best quality Noodles, hands down. All clean, and the food always tastes like it was just made, not pre cooked like a lot of other Noodles I've been to."}
{"text":"I like this place..the food is cooked to order witch is always good and  the staff is always friendly...i recomend the alfredo mount amore'"}
{"text":"Worst place won't go back EVER!! I ordered one thing and got something else.  Had to wait some more finally got the food like 30 minutes later.  Spent like almost an hour to get some noodles to go. And the food was mediocre at best. Won't be goin back there. Went in there with a good mood got out of there pissed off"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I don't care what you think. LOVE  I'm a carb addict, hardcore. Luckily I'm a running addict as well, and the two go well together.   State St. Is my favorite location although it can, at times, get overrun by people. I live near the area so sometimes I call for pickup on my way home from work. They've never gotten my order wrong, ever.  I like the dine-in style, I like the consistency, I've never had a bad meal from Noodles.  My current favorites: Buttered noodles and Parmesan with chicken and broccoli. Steak stroganoff  Spinach and fresh fruit salad with balsamic fig dressing Thai curry soup with shrimp  Runners up: Pesto cavatappi Japanese pan noodles Wisconsin Mac  Stay away from:  The Indonesian peanut sauté and the Bangkok curry. They're fools to believe they can reproduce those dishes, and I will not disappoint myself by ordering them."}
{"text":"Popular lunch spot in a good location, next to Tijuana Flats.  I was expecting a bit more out of the food, but was very unimpressed.  It's a nice layout, and when you walk in, you order, and then sit down.  I like how they bring your food to you and bus your table for you, that's very nice / good customer service.  Their tomato basil bisque soup was delicious - it's hard to mess it up, but it hit the spot.  I also had the Bangkok Curry salad and it was not good at all.  To start, it was extremely bland as the curry is completely watered-down and just sits at the bottom of the bowl.  Even when trying to mix the ingredients together, I couldn't get any of the curry aroma and flavors into the salad.  I got it with tofu and couldn't even find many tofu pieces in the dish.  The ingredients are simple - peppers, carrots, broccoli, so I don't know how they could mess this dish up.  Overall, I may have just gotten a bad a salad and/or it was a bad day for them, but there are probably better salads (and lunch spots)."}
{"text":"The beef stroganoff was really good, I highly recommend that one.  The truffle mac and cheese was pretty good... but I am not sure how much I liked it.  It was actually pretty bland.  The truffle was subtle, but the cheese sauce was watered down and very not cheese at all.  It kind of tasted like Kaft mac and cheese with a spritz of truffle oil.  It would be much better if if the sauce were thicker, creamier, and cheesier... and with bacon bits!    I have never been to other Noodles and Company, but the service at this location was very good.  The staff was really nice.  And the take out containers are really cute!"}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter looking for some good ramen. No ramen, but I got excited for their Korean beef. That quickly faded, when I got the meal. It was that bland sort of spicy and had hardly any beef in it. The service was just about as bland as the food, and what we got didn't warrant the price at all."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I wasn't expecting much of this place. Just another crappy asian food place. I was surprised when I found out that it wasn't just asian style noodle dishes, but all different kinds.  You pay up front, and the food is brought out to you. I had the spicy beef. it was really good. And the portion are quite healthy considered how fair the prices are."}
{"text":"As I continue having to hunt done cheap places for dinner downtown, I have tested out Noodles & Company a few times.  While a national chain, this place has speed most days at lunch within the ordering process.  I can't even imagine working here because so many people slam this place for lunch.  Dinner time is much more relaxed and there is always plenty of space to eat in.  I usually play it safe and order the macaroni and cheese.  It is exceptionally mild so I like to take it back to work and add some sriracha sauce to it.  The portion is good for lunch and a decent size for dinner, although I sometimes need just a little more.  They also have one of those cool soda machines where you can make a million flavors of soda.  While the food is national chain quality, this particular one is pretty fast in the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Whent for dinner, food was good and came out very quickly. Glad to have a good noodle place in area after the disappointing nothing but noodles closed."}
{"text":"\"Delicious food\" is the first thing I will say. It probably helps that they have noodles as their main dish, but the noodles that they serve you are nigh perfect. I specifically recommend the Japanese Pan Noodles (without the marinated steak though). My noodles were served with a bit of cilantro (for breath-neutralization, I assume) and the iced tea is awesome. Just don't get the sweet tea. Seriously, the market for sugar must have had a noticeable increase the day Noodles & Company brought out their sweetened iced tea.   The atmosphere is very modern. It makes me think of IKEA mixed with Asian minimalism. And I mean that as a compliment, not a criticism. Lunch is pretty noisy, but go in the late afternoon and you will be able to eat in solace.   All and all, if you are looking for a good noodle restaurant but don't want the \"divey\" feel of LuLu's Noodles (or you *do* want the clean feeling of a modern restaurant), I would definitely recommend Noodles & Company"}
{"text":"It's a nice place for a quick lunch or supper. The food is decent, and really fast. We go there when the kids have practice, go In and out about 15 to 20 minutes!!"}
{"text":"I just went to this location today (5/27/09) with a couple of friends and I have to say, I was impressed.  The decor was very clean and simple, with artwork from around the world.  This was my first time trying Noodles&co so I had no expectations.  The cashier was very friendly and patient as I took my time to go over the menu.    I ended up ordering the Japanese pan noodles with chicken and organic iced tea. and it was SO GOOD.  I ordered the small portion and was disappointed in the small amount of noodles (I know I asked for a small but I still expected a bit more).  It comes with the udon noodles, broccoli, mushrooms (not that many) , asian sprouts and black sesame seeds. (It says that it's recommended to go with beef but I rarely eat that much beef).  The organic iced tea (sweetened) was so refreshing. I'm not a fan of the typical southern \"sweet tea\" so I really enjoyed it.  It wasn't too sweet but didn't leave a bitter taste either.  A great drink  on a warm day.  If you dine in, you can opt to have your drink \"to-go\" (especially if you enjoyed your beverage as much as I did) free of charge.  This is a place I definitely recommend and will be frequenting quite heavily."}
{"text":"I am happy to update my previous review by stating that this location of Noodles & Co has completely turned things around.   The staff has been incredibly warm and friendly each time I've stopped in and more than willing to further explain or offer other menu items. The menu boards are available on the walls with pictures and description as well as a truncated version above the registers. They have a glass front refrigerator off to the side of the registers that boasts Spindrift seltzers and other name brand drinks. There's also a coca cola machine in the main dining area.  Whenever I order anything, I always go with the 'small' size because I get at least two portions which is a WIN-WIN for me. Also, once you've ordered and paid, you are given the chance to complete a survey online where you can redeem the code for a free appetizer.  They also have an app and the option to place your order online via their website so you can just walk in and pick up. Lots to like and appreciate at Noodles!"}
{"text":"If your vegetarian.....vegan.....or just your average HEALTHY Joe then this is your location. This is only the second location in the ENTIRE state of Arizona and I am stoked because it is within walking distance of my job. There are noodles.....salads.....and Sandwiches for everyone.....but the NOODLES are AWESOME. I had the Japanese Pan Noodles with TOFU and while they were not as Spicy as I like they were delicious. My only complaint was the veggies.....they were great but they need to include more especially for a bowl that is north of 8 bucks. Now don't get me wrong this won't deter me from coming to this locale in the future because I am extremely excited it is near my place of employment.....however I will ask for more veggies next time.   This place is located right off the Freeway (check the address above) but some people may know it as the Deer Valley Towne Center. It is located right next to the WildFlower Bread Company Restaurant which is right next to a Mattress Firm. Don't forget to sign up for the E-Club and right now when you buy an Entree' you will get a coupon to take a survey to receive a free Appetizer with purchase on your next visit. So if your ever in the area and have a craving for something fresh and Healthy give these guys a try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently called this restaurant to get some info on the menu and the lady who answered the phone was very rude. When I asked her questions she was acting like I was bothering her and wasting her time. She was very sarcastic and did not help me at all. Very poor customer service. The food is fine nothing too special."}
{"text":"Quick and easy way to get your noodles or pasta anyway you want it! Are you craving an Italian dish, but your food companion wants an Asian dish? Well, no worries as long as he/she wants a carb dish! My husband and I came here the night before the Phoenix Marathon. We were looking for a easy pasta dish for carbo loading. All the other Italian restaurants in the area had a monstrous wait, or were located outside of Tempe. We found this place thanks to Yelp. I had the pesto pasta and my husband had the Penne Rosa. Both were al dente and perfect, the cheapest pasta dinner we ever had!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here tonight.... but it was a mistake!!!!!  The lady wiping down tables was rude because we wanted to sit in a booth.  She finally wiped it down and left us a swimming pool on the table, YUCK!  Then our food finally showed up on a dirty plate! We did not eat here.... I asked for my money back!"}
{"text":"Go frequently but was SO disappointed today. Got buttered noodles and grilled chicken to go, as it was close to closing. Got home with my meal and realized it had NO chicken. The whole point I got it was FOR the grilled chicken. So I ended up spending more than NINE DOLLARS on a bowl of noodles with cheese sprinkled on top and no protein. I should have checked before I left but seriously the place was empty and my receipt said Chicken. Would love to get some money back for the lack of chicken. I've been going to this location for a few years now so this was incredibly disappointing after a long day."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Under new management and this place is really turning around.... food is great and they even have a gluten free option!! Super awesome :)"}
{"text":"Super excited when i saw we had a Noodles & Co in AZ.  I had them everywhere in Detroit.  Exactly what I remembered.  Fair prices amd consistently good food for a chain."}
{"text":"Noodles and co is a great casual dining place with a ton of different options inspired by noodle dishes from around the world. The portions are good for one large meal, but not enough for two smaller ones. I almost always get takeout and they are pretty quick about getting me my order. The food stands up really well to refrigeration and reheating, the spinach and tomatoes are always still perfectly juicy/crunchy, the noodles don't feel soggy, and the sauce can look a bit odd but always tastes delicious. I've only had a few of their dishes but I like what I've. My favorites go between their Alfredo Montamore and the Pesto Cavatappi with pork. I also enjoy the mac and cheese, which is good with the pork or the parmesan encrusted chicken."}
{"text":"While it was a little discerning that no employees were to be found when I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised that someone came out from the back within seconds. I got the Small Pesto Cavatappi. It's was delicious and just the perfect size. Maybe next time I will have to choose the Buffalo Mac"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here the other night. I personally love this place. The time we walked in was 8:10pm and the store closes at 9:00pm. We got treated so badly because apparently they were trying to clean up the kitchen and close already. The two blondes there were slamming dishes around while looking at my husband and I take a seat after ordering. This is the second time I have received bad service from the blonde working at the register. We felt so rushed and like we were a bother to be there. I usually never write reviews but I had to this time. I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble but at least the manager should know what goes on in the store when their not around."}
{"text":"So I guess I have no one to blame but myself for this one... as much as I want to give them 2 stars, I have to give them three for my poor decision making on getting the Shrimp Pad Thai here when I knew my obsession for Thai food was not going to benefit me at a place like this.  I should have opted for a different dish (perhaps Mac and Cheese or sorts or some Italianish sort of thing).   Despite the location being new, everyone seemed to have already been through the pains of being a new store.  Very busy too even though it was during the seasonal break (which was why we opted to venture there when we did).  Service was quick and good!  I will definitely come back, but the next visit will definitely not include Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"So.. I like pesto chicken.  I tried it again, this time opted for Parmesan chicken pesto. I had hoped the chicken would have better flavor. It didn't.  I think I'll skip the chicken next time.   The portion was better.  I got the regular size. It was hot, seasoned well and the noodles were cooked properly.    The service was friendly as usual.  They even checked in on me while eating. Just to be sure it was all ok.   The front counter girl in glasses needs a raise. She was working....and doing it right."}
{"text":"Love Noodles.... but not this one.  I came after lunch rush I'm guessing, but every table was dirty.  The soda area was full of water and Siracha sauce.  It looked like one of the bottles exploded.    Only one customer came in while I was there (10-15 minutes).  Nobody came out to clean that entire time.  I would give them two stars but the gentleman who took my order was nice and the food was good.  It was freezing in the restaurant as well.  I could feel a breeze the whole time I was there.  Great food, just not a great location."}
{"text":"Well, yup, the noodles here are pretty good. So, yup, if you're gluten free, they will accommodate your pasta if you pay more money. Eh, yup, they forgot to add the chicken I ordered in my Pad Thai, so I had to send it back. Um, yup, there was a HAIR in my Pad Thai when they \"fixed\" it. No, yup, it wasn't just in the dish, I noticed it as it was in my mouth. I flossed my teeth in Noodles & Company last night with a nasty, jet-black, protein rich 5-incher of human head hair last night.  Obviously, this is going to bring down my review, but the food here is still good. The manager made me a new dish free of charge and threw in a rice krispie treat on the house. I'll still eat here."}
{"text":"I remember when Noodles first opened and I thought it was pretty great to go get a bowl of buttered noodles (kid sized) for like $2.50.  Now, I stop to think about it, and I could buy a POUND of noodles for 99 cents.  The bowl sizes have gotten smaller, and the prices have risen.  Really, prices are pretty ridiculous for the food you're getting.    Plus, I heard from someone that I trust that the place has rats."}
{"text":"Great place in the PATH underground to grab a quick lunch. Ordered their vegetarian carbonara.  Pretty decent. Was my first time, the cashier looked annoyed. Service was OK. They serve breakfast at 6:30 which is convenient for me since I start work usually at 7 am."}
{"text":"Location is a lot different than the downtown one, crazy busy around the lunch hour...but the food...oh the food!  There is nothing like the indo peanut.  It may not be authentic, but it is delicious, for sure.  Worth a stop - be extra nice to the staff, they are awesome."}
{"text":"I'm beyond impressed with this company. First of all: gluten free noodles. I ordered the Pesto Cavatappi with grilled chicken. The host, Alexandria, was knowledgeable of the dishes and even asked if the grilled chicken was okay if it used the same grill as gluten items. I appreciated how honest she was. We had minimal wait time for our orders. The portion size was perfect. The facility was clean and the staff was very friendly. I'd recommend this location in the future. :)"}
{"text":"After walking over to Firehouse Subs in the Arboretum, we noticed Noodles and Company. The menu seemed good and healthy, so we gave it a shot. Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted and asked if we had any questions. Just kidding--nobody was at the register. Finally a young man got there, and we ordered. I got the Pad Thai with chicken, and my mom got a BBQ Chicken Salad.   After getting my soda from the bad-as-usual Coca Cola Freestyle machine, we sat down at a somewhat dirty table. The whole place wasn't very clean--ugh. My Pad Thai was okay. It really didn't have that Pad Thai-ish taste. It was bland and eh. It needed some peanut sauce or something. My mom's salad was delicious, the chicken was great and the sauce was fantastic. I ended up eating a quarter of it.  Overall, Noodles and Co. is an alright place. Would I go again? Probably not, considering there's a Firehouse Subs right next door which I think are great. If you're in the Arboretum searching for some healthy, quick food, maybe give this place a shot."}
{"text":"After watching the Southborough development be built for two years, I was so excited to see Noodles & Company open there this week. Sadly, I wasn't wowed by the food. I had the Indonesian peanut saute with chicken, and my boyfriend got the Japanese pan noodles with beef. Both dishes were OK but not amazing. I got a regular size but should have gotten a small. The portions are huge!  The place is cute, and there was plenty of seating. You can order a variety of noodle concoctions, including Asian, Mediterranean and American dishes. The staff was very friendly, and since the place just opened yesterday, the managers kept coming to our table to ask how things were. Then they gave us - and everyone else at the restaurant - huge rice krispies treats on the house. I'll definitely go back and try another dish there."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE noodle dish and fan and was quite excited to try this place!  Big, big letdown.  I was told to order online to avoid the RIDICULOUSLY long lunch hour lines & yes, ordering online was a breeze (The initial price of the noodle bowl isn't bad but add meat or tofu topping and you're quickly up to over $8.  Yet I was hopeful it would be worth it).  The restaurant:  LOUD (blasting music & loud customers in a place w a high, metal ceiling), cramped (tables sooo close together), jam-packed.    The food: Meh. I ordered the Japanese pan noodle dish with tofu.  They skimped on the tofu & vegetables but there were loads and loads of sticky, gummy soba-ish noodles.  The sauce was barely there and had been completely cooked on and into the noodles.  Not much flavor at all.  The only thing that made it edible was a heavy dose of sriracha sauce.   Maybe their fatty mac & cheese dishes are amazing but I certainly won't be back to try for $9 a bowl."}
{"text":"I'd heard mixed things about this chain, but wanted to try this new location. Lunch was a disappointment. Service was good, and the place was clean with a nice open feeling, but we just couldn't get over that food. The Napa Market Salad salad was just okay, but had some old lettuce in it. It came with \"grilled\" chicken that looked good, but tasted boiled. The Japanese pan noodles were a miss for me. They came out lukewarm. The noodles themselves were nice quality noodles, but ruined by the sauce. Just seemed like heated soy sauce with a bit of sugar. No other flavor, mostly salt from the soy. I order fried noodles from many places and these were the saltiest I've had in a long time. It could've been so much better with a better sauce. The veggies paired with it were weird, what seemed like reconstituted mushroom slices, raw-ish pieces of broccoli, and hunks of mostly raw carrot. It was topped with raw bean sprouts. The sprouts did nothing for it. Might have been better if they'd been sauteed with the noodles. Meh. I only ate a few bites and had to toss the rest. I noticed the people around us who got Mac and Cheese or Stroganoff seemed to like their dishes better. Maybe we ordered the wrong things.   I will note that they had kids meal options and tasty looking cookies and rice crispy treats as dessert options. Self-serve soft drinks with coke products. Counter service. They bring food out to your table.  Not likely to be back any time soon. 2 stars."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new so we decided to visit Noodles & Co. Um, so glad we did because this place made all of our tummies happy. We all were hangry for something different and I couldn't hack Chilies another night...first world problems. Noodles was great and it felt a lot like Pee Wei inside but not. Maybe it was the cool background music they played, but the atmosphere was definitely reminiscent of some place familiar (which was very pleasant).  We ordered the BBQ pork mac and cheese, the butter noodles and the garlic cheese bread shareable. It was delicious and even though all the meals were super different they were all just exactly what we were looking for. The BBQ mac and cheese was creamy (that's a fun word) and tangy and mouth pleasing. Beware of the hot ass jalapeño chips that are broken and sprinkled on top for surprise. The spicy sprinkle was not listed in that dish or we would have asked for them to hold the heartburn.  The butter noodles were fabulously buttered, and oh so good and made with love. Our son loved it, and the reason we knew he was enjoying the meal so much was because we had to remind him to chew.  The garlic cheesy bread was even great. The marinara dipping sauce was tasty and made us excited to go back and try the spaghetti and meatballs.  Overall Noodles & Co. was a big hit and it wasn't too much of a dent in the ol' pocketbook. Do people even say pocketbook anymore? Meh, just try it, thank me later."}
{"text":"Noodles and Company is always one of the best restaurant experiences. The food is fantastic. Bangkok Curry is so good, best macaroni and cheese. I see some people complain about speed. Gees Pittsburgians are the most impatient people on the planet. Wait a little longer for good and nutritious food! It's well worth it."}
{"text":"My daughter has several food allergies making it difficult to eat out. We are always looking for new options. She wanted to see if this place had anything she could eat. The cashier was extremely nice trying to determine if there was any options. She turned it over to Sterling who researched every ingredient for her allergies and came up with an  improvised dish and then personally prepared it. Above and beyond. Thanks."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. Went here for lunch today. Never again. I got in line at 11:40a.m. and ordered chicken noodle soup with a side caesar salad. It was a decent 15 minute wait. Finally got my food, got back in my car, got ALL the way back to work, sat down to eat and realized there was no chicken in my chicken noodle soup and they had given me a side order of chicken noodle soup (also without chicken). Went back to the store and had to wait in another 15 minute line to tell them that it was wrong. All they did was throw some diced chicken into the soup they had already given me and then gave me the salad. No apologies. Nothing. I got back to work at 12:45p.m. Waste of time and my soup was freezing. So disappointed."}
{"text":"At first, I completely ignored Noodles and Company because I used to look at the place and think, \"Is it really necessary to have thousands of different noodle dishes?\" Then I actually tried the place. I tried a dish from the American side, can't remember which one, but it was sooooo good. I couldn't stop eating it . I can't help but think that it has the most interesting taste. The seasoning kind of reminds me of the seasoning in Ramen noodles. Pretty good overall, but why in the world do they sell wine? Is that not random?"}
{"text":"Noodles & Company is one of several new restaurants that opened near Costco in the San Tan Village area.  Most, like this one, are the order-first-then-seat-yourself type -- the kind of place I appreciate on a busy day.  Noodles & Company has a fun menu.  First you choose a noodle type, then a topping.  Even though the Steak Stroganoff tempted me, on this visit I chose the Thai Green Curry with Shrimp.  It was a good mixture of veggies and shrimp on a bed of Udon noodles.    Have fussy kids?  There's even a plain buttered noodles dish and two types of mac n cheese. There are about three dessert choices, nothing too exciting.  But the appetizers looked good (Korean meatballs, potstickers).    They are currently offering a $5 bonus card for every $25 in restaurant cards you buy.  Here's a tip:  Buy the $25 card first, then use it right away on your meal order.  You have 40-60 days to use the bonus card."}
{"text":"Second time here, I loved it the first time. I has ordered the pesto Cavapatti delicious, with the tomato bisque soup. This time I am Having the pop stickers, garlic bread and the Alfredo Montam it didn't disappoint. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Yay! They're here! I loved this place on a visit to the east coast a couple of years ago.  I got the small Indonesian Peanut Saute and a small side salad and it was the perfect size for lunch!  Tasty, quick, affordable!"}
{"text":"I think they just opened, but it's pretty good! I love how the foods \"healthy\" and organic! And the fact that it's not that expansive either for good quality food(: but the food is lacking a LITTLE flavor.. will come back though!"}
{"text":"I went here before a movie. I'd done my research in advance and was pleased that they had several dishes that could be made gluten-free. I ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts, and I was pleased when the cashier asked if I had a peanut allergy. (I don't. I just didn't want the extra calories.)   My meal was good. If I was making my own Pad Thai, I'd leave off the bean sprouts. They're flavorless.   The food was good enough to go back, but it wasn't OMG-it's-so-good good. But for speedy carbs at an affordable price, it did its job."}
{"text":"The pad thai didn't have much flavor. It wasn't listed as spicy but it was... The inside was really nice looking. I may give it another shot but I'm not impressed so far."}
{"text":"I've gone here 3 straight days. I was def excited having a new place open in the area. They're 0-3. 1st 2 days my food was cold and undercooked. 3rd day I was charged 12.50 for a really undersized portion. In the pic it was in a big bowl. Not sure if the staff has trained enough yet. Everyone seems knowledgable but the execution is def far behind. Not giving up on it, but for my money I'm going to genghis grill."}
{"text":"Our first time here and most likely our last. My wife had the Pesto Cavatappi with chicken breast, I had the Bacon Mac & Cheeseburger and we also had the 3-pc. Pot Stickers. To start, the pot stickers came out on a plate, looked like they were smashed flat. I thought this was odd, but this was are first time here, so maybe they do them different. The filling was almost non-exsistant. Not happy with these at all. Later a table next to us , also ordered the same pot stickers, and they were more plump, like they should be. My wife liked hers, but its really is mostly noodles, and skimpy on the chicken. My Bacon Mac and Cheeseburger was not bad, but it was already just warm, not really hot. like it should be. We both had the regular size, so it really feels like your eating so much noodles. The small size would have been better. In mine too, the meat was not that plentiful, again, you feel like your just eating a big bowl of mac noodles. Mine was pretty dry, could have used more cheese. I know this was our first time here, but in this day and age, with so many choices out there, if a place really doesn't impress me on the first visit, then I don't usually come back. This cost us $28.17 with two fan drinks and a very average cookie. Like others have said, not a lot of seating, when it gets busy. So that being said, I'm sure I can be more picky then others,  but this is how I feel. I have to give this place a \"Doh\"."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest and spending a lot of time in Wisconsin, I may be bias, but I LOOVE noodles & co and so glad they finally opened up a branch out here in Arizona. They obviously have all noodle dishes, with various meats to add to your dish. My favorite is the buttered noodles but the Wisconsin Mac & cheese is the bomb.com and their rice Krispy treats are heaven in your mouth. I know it's scary to try new things but you will not regret the deliciousness that is noodles & co!"}
{"text":"I miss Noodles! This was a weekly staple for me in my college days. It's nothing fancy but it is good, cheap, and fast. I wish they would open in Charleston!"}
{"text":"I had not been here for a while and I just stopped in for a quick lunch. The Mediterranean salad looked good. I ordered it with chicken. Ordering and the wait were quick. I was disappointed in the salad. Half of it was macaroni pasta and it didn't look like the photo on the menu board. I was excited about all those yummy vegetables. Take away the macaroni and it was like a small or regular side salad."}
{"text":"My favourite lunch place at work. Excellent service and food is nothing like typically cafeteria food. Excellent quality! Try the Penne Rosa, korean beef noodle and the shrimp pad thai."}
{"text":"This place is not good. Simple as that. I paid $26 for some spaghetti and Mac and cheese and 2 sodas. The spaghetti resembled VERY closely a banquet TV dinner. I've been known to eat a banquet TV dinner ($1) from time to time and prefer their sauce to that of Noodles Corporation or whatever. The meatballs were a dead ringer, you could tell they are frozen and their flavor was extremely bland. The Mac and Cheese had no flavor, a real runny type of cheese and flavorless.   Now this is where the meal took an incredible turn, the Coke was amazing. I opted for a Vanilla Coke from their one freestyle machine and let me tell ya, it was worth the wait behind several technology inept individuals pounding away at the multitude of choices and screens before them. This particular twist on Coca Cola's signature product was both refreshing and unexpected. The vanilla flavors really played well with the natural deliciousness of the Coke. Well done Noodles and Co, well done!   Anyway, to sum up, you'd be better advised to skip Noodle Palace and hit up your local Fry's Food to grab yourself a few banquet dinners and a sixer of your favorite brand of soda."}
{"text":"ehhh.. ive debated on 2 or 3 stars. since i can see myself heading back try something else, i figured i'll go with 3   i ordered the Japenese Pan Noodles with chicken. It's my birthday so i received an email about a free bowl. The dish i picked sounded good and looked delish, but it just wasnt all that. As someone else mentioned, the noodles were sticky, which is unappetizing. The sauce tastes like a thick version of soy sauce. i love soy sauce on rice but this just wasnt good. Halfway through my dish, i just picked out the chicken and ate that.  because of the nice workers and birthday club, i'll bump it up to 3 stars. Other dishes looked good so i may be back to try them....."}
{"text":"Ive ate at this location many of times staff is always friendly and food is always great and vey quick but Thursday put the icing on the cake when I met the district manager he was VERY passionate about his job I honestly thought he was the owner. he introduced himself and went over the menu and educated us on how they update he menus every so often also explained how we can change anything we don't like on our noodle dishes . He really helped out his staff and he acted like a equal you rarely see that management. He was back there helping his staff he helped cooking , setting up the dishes, to even cleaning and he even brought the food to everyone's table , he made sure everyone was happy and comfortable and asked if anyone needed anything . I was with my 2 year old daughter he's very good with kids. I hope someone higher up reads this because he really is a great person to have working for noodles and company really made a great impression on everyone ."}
{"text":"Was briefly in town for a wedding and decided to pop into this location since I saw them scattered all over town.  Got their alfredo dish to go.  SOOO YUMMY!  I wish I was in town longer to eat it a few more times!  Service was quick and friendly.  There is a location 3 hours away from me so I'll have to hit one when I have my next road trip."}
{"text":"Since my dentist gave me a free meal with them, I decided to try. This place is really nice. The people are friendly and they look as if they are having fun. The curry soup is good. The pad thai is ok... I wish it was more spicer and had more sauce on it."}
{"text":"This is one of my least favorite Noodles spot. Who would put a Noodles location in a parking lot with ten spots and a dead end.  However, it is my closest Noodles. The staff is so friendly and as busy as it is, the location is always clean. So tough out the traffic and you will get a good quick meal."}
{"text":"I don't know why this location is so bad!  The tables are filthy with bugs walking on the tabletop.   How can they screw up standard items on their menu that have no modifications?  The music was ear ringing loud and I asked for it to be turned down three times after someone else that worked there kept turning it back up.  The baby's screams a few tables down ended, too!  Yay!  The fourth item at our table was delivered 20 minutes after the other three entrees.  So much for eating together.    I like Noodles & Company.  In spite of this location being within walking distance of my home, I will frequent other locations."}
{"text":"I took lunch to go from here. It was my first experience at Noodles and Company. I like the menu and the variety in pasta, meats, and salads. I also like the variety in cuisine from Asian to Italian to American.   I had the Beef Stroganoff. It was yummy! The sauce was creamy & rich. The pasta was cooked perfectly. And the beef was very tender, not I was expecting from a franchise. They also give you a lot of food. I now have dinner for tonight too. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ok so first time ever and it's was super good. Love the program they offer in the app (which you should get) and the service was fast and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying they possibly have the nicest employees ever- and that's saying a lot considering there's a Chikfila and an In and Out nearby.  The young man at the counter was happily willing to answer any of our questions (some people are annoyed if I ask a question or don't even know the answer themselves). The food selection was great- healthy options that are guilt free all the way to savory high calorie deliciousness. We got the steak stroganoff and the parm crusted chicken alfredo. Both were reasonably priced, good portions. They were delicious!!! I also want to add that the girl who brought us our food (we ordered it to go) was so freaking nice I just had to smile despite being painfully sore from the gym and exhausted from my day.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Noodles have always been my top 1 comfort food but the Japanese pan noodles at this place did not bring me comfort. Quite the contrary, I experienced nothing more than a bloated stomach and an overly sweet greasy taste lingering in my mouth. The prices are low but the serving size is also proportional to the price."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre food.   I had the Spicy Korean Beef noodles.   Way too sweet.  I could taste some of the gochujang sauce and that's really the only connection to the Korean part in its name.   Added some sriracha and soy sauce so I could eat what I ordered.  Won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, wasn't great. I'm going to give it another shot when they get more settled.   We have the Asian noodles and mac and cheese. Both dishes were good.   The place was a little chaotic, not enough seating, and literally every flavor of Coke was out.   Will try again!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm too lazy to cook or don't have enough time in the evening to prepare something, I seem to unduly forget about this place as a dinner option. Pasta is the easiest thing in the world to cook and I could just as easily do it at home. So why do I come here? Because they have a bunch of great combinations for pasta dishes that I either don't have the ingredients on hand for or would be too expensive to make for just a solo meal. It's not 5-star food, but it's pretty quick, tastes pretty good and is reasonably priced. when you can't force yourself to eat Chipotle for the third or fourth time in a week, consider this place."}
{"text":"The concept of this is great, there is something for everyone, however, pay very close attention to the nutritional facts.  My friend and I went to the new location downtown.  We peeked at the menu and nutritional facts ahead of time so I was aware of what I was ordering before I got there.  We entered and there was no line.    We encountered a ver courteous cashier who explained how everything worked.  He took our order and we got a table.  The tables were clean but a little cramped together.  Our food was delivered timely and was pretty good.  Not the best thing I have had in Pittsburgh but it was A-OK!  The food was warm and fresh.  I had the Japanese Pan Noodles with beef.  We also ordered the Pot Stickers which were better than my meal.  I should mention that they have a wide variety of fountain drinks, including diet vanilla dr. pepper....YUMM!  There are employees that walk around and gather dishes and ask if there is anything else that you need.  I was shocked to discover when I got back that my meal had 620 calories and the beef was an additional 340 calories.  If you find the nutritional information online you must order the small portion, which was not given to me as an option.  The website provides a flowchart of what you can order to stay under 500 caloriess but you have to order the small portions.  I also found online that they do have the option to order a small meal, with a protein, and soup or salad.  I think that will be the best option for those that count calories.  I will probably go back there at some point but no rush on my end.  I will also need to pay alot more attention to the nutritional content upon ordering."}
{"text":"This place is one of the healthier options for lunch in Oakland, and a good alternative to the fast food joints in the area.  As the name suggests, they specialize in noodles, which includes American and Italian-inspired types as well as the Asian-inspired ones you might think of.  I've tried several varieties here and at the downtown location, including the penne rosa, pesto cavatappi, and mac and cheese.  Although the dishes may not be the most exciting ones you'll find in the area, all of them have been served hot, have tasted good, and have been filling, providing for a solid lunch (or dinner, in the case of my downtown excursions).  The small size is perfect for a lunch portion, whereas the larger size is better for dinner, and meat can be added for an upcharge.  I've tried the parmesan chicken (on the pesto cavatappi) and the BBQ pork (on the macaroni), and both have been tasty and have gone well with these dishes.  Although I don't usually order a drink, as other reviewers have mentioned, they have the Coke freestyle machine, which provides for unlimited flavor customization options. However, there is another establishment down the street that has a Boylan soda fountain, so if I'm feeling like a soda, that's more my speed. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The place is always packed during lunch, for great reasoning, their food is amazing even during the lunch rush, they never drop the ball.  The people taking your order are very friendly &I always get your order right. Even though they have so many orders rolling in at once & they have to move quick the quality of food is still great!!   Definitely recommend if you want great noodles during lunch. The Japanese pan noodle with tofu is great."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, fast service, and big portions.  The only slight negative was that my wife's Japanese noodles were a bit spicy.  Now, she has a very low spice tolerance, but Japanese noodles should always be super mild (unlike Chinese or Korean).  The veggies were decently crispy, unlike many places that cook them into mush.  Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Noodles is.... Noodles.  This place reminds me of pretty much all the other Noodles I've been to.  They produce a consistent product that people enjoy."}
{"text":"Food is amazing I love it, but the service is HORRIBLE! They have young kids working that I don't think know how to read. It's sad, I've been here 3 times cuz I love the food but I have to go back every time because they don't read the instructions. The management staff is a joke and they really need to work on training employees on how to take care of the customer. I can't ever take friends here because I might be embarrassed by the service."}
{"text":"Fast food style noodle joint that will satisfy your hunger and may offer some variety to your normal routine. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the Japanese Pan Noodles that were recommended by the cashier. The service was very good as someone was roaming around the dining area to see how things were going. I enjoyed the passion tea that was brewed and had a good experience overall. This is not on my \"A-List\" of places to take a friend but occasionally stopping by, I say yes.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Kitchen manager or chef was the only employee with a personality. I was made to feel bothersome. When my order was incorrect & I went back to register, two employees were standing there eating and just stared at me. Neither apologized. That's when the chef came out to correct things. Front of house staff was just terrible."}
{"text":"The quick pickup is sadly not very quick. I still love the food even though mine was cold after waiting for my friends food"}
{"text":"Simply stated... Low quality, over priced, and not tasty. The pasta is over cooked and low quality.  The employees are nice but it doesn't make up for the poor food quality. We were excited to try but we won't be back. If you like your pasta over cooked and don't mind low quality ingredients that are over priced then noodles would be for you."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company is one of the few chain restaurants we frequent.  Unlike a lot of chains, I dont really notice much difference between the different locations.  The company seems to do well re: consistency.  My biggest complaint is that they stopped the old rewards program which I used religiously (and got free Noodles on my birthday) and replaced it with an App, which doesnt always work, and seems to offer far fewer perks.  You can get a filling, relatively healthy (especially given that they now have a wider selection of salads and you can replace pasta with zucchini noodles!) meal for around $10.  My kid likes it, and she's picky.  My wife likes it, and she's picky.  I like it.  If you dont like it, they will make you something else, every time.  Pesto Cavatappi seems to be the universal favorite.  My wife also likes the Japanese Pan Noodles and the Southwest Salad.  I like . . . just about everything I've tried.  Some of the dishes are more bland, but you should be able to identify which those are from the descriptions.  One of our more frequent takeout options, despite them not being locally owned."}
{"text":"I was here about six months ago and left unsatisfied. I really like to try to follow-up on places that I only award one or two stars, because I understand that everyone is human (for goodness sake, I was a psychology major) and people have off days.  With that being said, I am going to bump my original two-star review up to four. I had the spicy meatball appetizer, and it was pretty good. I think 10 meatballs was $4.89, which I thought was a fair price. They weren't hot enough (temperature-wise) but they had great flavor. Just enough of a kick to keep it interesting.  I also tried the steak stroganoff again and I was met with a LOT more food than I had had last time at this location. Unfortunately, the dish lacked sauce and it was room-temperature at best. I don't recall the exact pricing; I think the stroganoff was like $5.90 which is on par for fast food, and the addition of steak was around $2.90. I thought that there could have been a little more steak for that price.  The sweet tea was much better tonight than it was six months ago, and the service was friendly. The first fork I took was dirty, but not everything can always be perfect so I let that one slide.  Like I said, I try to \"re-review\" my one- and two- star reviews. I think it's fair to say that everyone has an off day, restaurants deplete the stock of the food you want, customers and employees clash, or something gets miscommunicated periodically. I hope this \"re-review\" helps anyone who was on the fence about dining here."}
{"text":"Came here 7:30pm on a Tuesday, ordered take out. The dining room was completely trashed for how little people were dining in. The employees were dropping f bombs for all to hear, one girl walked around the kitchen area while eating her own food as it fell out of her mouth. The gentleman cooking the food had headphones in and mid cooking pulled an ear bud out of his ear and continued to cook. Giving 3 stars because all things considered it was just unappetizing all around."}
{"text":"Really not a bad place. This was our first time here and we were surprised. Got to admit, there was some worry with some of the reviews we saw but we decided to stuck to our guns. I ordered the pad Thai and the gf got the Japanese udon. Both came out steaming hot. Both were big bowls, so the portuon wasnt too bad. I added steak to mine for an extra 2.99. Unfortunately, the amount of steak I got wasn't worth the extra charge. Legit about 5 little pieces.  Both were also delicious full of flavors. Would liked to have seen a little more vegetables, though. We also threw in a 6 piece order of pot stickers. That was 4.99. And they were good. Nothing special. All in all, it was a good experience food wise and we will probably be back. Service could use a little umph of motivation."}
{"text":"We went on a Sat evening before a show at the Benedum so it was pretty busy, but the line went fast. I ordered the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese with parmesan chicken. it came out very hot and cooked well. the flavor was good but I was disappointed in that it was a tad runny and a majority of the noodles had no cheese/sauce on them. The chicken was great, nice crust and very tasty!   I will definitely try this again, but I will try something other than mac & cheese... which I should have donE in the first place."}
{"text":"Food is great everyday unlike pei wei which always taste different. The staff is super friendly!! And the food digests super easy never ever feel bloated which to me is most important! Love coming here! Did I mention how friendly the staff is!!!"}
{"text":"I've found that over the years the quality of the food at the state street location has been declining. It's unfortunate because the location is beautiful and perfect for people watching on any given afternoon"}
{"text":"This is a fun twist on pasta. I've learned to love pasta in all its various manifestations and cultural backgrounds since going veggie, so I love the idea of a all noodle, all the time restaurant.   The decor is cute, and the menu is interestingly diverse. It's new, so the staff is still eager and the management is interested in investigating whether or not the customers are being treated well, which makes for a more pleasant (if service-pesky) experience."}
{"text":"This is a quick dinner stop.  Overall menu is a little on the salty side.  Service is great."}
{"text":"very crowded but great view of state street.  All the food is very good and inexpensive.  They bring the food to your table after you order and you can leave the dishes and go when you are done.  No tips required which is nice for us but I wonder if it is nice for the employees.  you could leave a tip anyway.  Clean bathrooms are very important and theirs was good last I was there."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here and their prices are spot on.  Affordable too.  The restaurant is a little bit small but nice.  Pretty view off to the east when the fountains are on. Try the Pad Thai with steak, Pesto Cavatappi with chicken, Pasta Fresca, orThai Curry soup.  All very very good.  Oh!   And their Caesar salad has some of the best dressing around. This is a 5 star rating for a cafe style restaurant.   I would not give it the same rating if it were more of a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"2016 review:  I'm really disappointed.    Having worked in customer service for many years I was pleased recently when I started to get improved service at this location.   But I witnessed people being turned away at the door being told they were closed at 9:45 when the store says it is open till 10.  This sort of thing would never ever happen at the businesses I have worked for over the years and I can recount the hundreds of times that we have let people in the door past closing.    So when I see people being turned away it really shakes me to the core.   I move them down one star again for the bad service experience.    The food continues to be delicious but they need to honor their store hours.  2011 review: We received an apology from Noodles and Company in regard to our concerns with the service here.  I received the response the day after I sent it off on a Sunday no less.   How is that for customer service?  Great job.  We will now look for an improvement in their service.  I have upped them one star for their speedy response to our concerns.   Noodles also does a great job with their webpage and special offers.   Just take a look at their page sometime.   To us they are ahead of the game when it comes to being internet savvy. Anyway, in our opinion it is a great restaurant in contrast to similar venues and look forward to it to being even better in the future."}
{"text":"They just seem incapable of getting an order right, and the quality of ingredients is dropping.  Even though their dishes are all made the same, they somehow manage to leave things out, like the cilantro and the broccoli in my Japanese Pan Noodles today.  The marinated steak's quality is getting real sketchy - gristle and just weird tiny bits abound.  To top it off, the staff seems to be inattentive and lackadaisical - they need a good manager to wrangle these college kids.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food always tastes great and they're usually pretty quick at making it. I love the order ahead feature so it's waiting there for me when I arrive."}
{"text":"SUCH A WASTE OF $$$$$$.......  $9.00 for a bowl with almost no meat or veggies $2.00 for X-sauce (that is just greedy business practice)  1st time eating here   I talked with the store manager.....   the CUSTOMER SERVICE was everthing........ but I probably wont go back."}
{"text":"So the prices are high for noodles but the quality of the food to me is pretty good.  This location on deming is very busy during lunch hour.  If you want to laugh just watch people try to get their drinks at the electronic soda machine. It works so bad and older people have no idea where to start with it. People that even know how to use it have problems with it. Ill bet this goes away soon."}
{"text":"Let me first admit that my friend and I are Noodles fans; we like Noodles because it is quick, not fried food and typically good.  We have dined at most of the Noodles in the area, and they are not all the same.  This Noodles opened several months ago and we frequent it after her night classes at Edgewood.  We both agree that the food and service at this location is better than most.  We are there at night, when it is not busy....full disclosure.  And we are typically there until close.  Our food has been well prepared.  Our service is fast and friendly.  And we never feel like we need to leave so they can clean up.    Yes, I am a fan.  Try it some time."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new restaurant on a rainy day recently. We went inside and picked up a menu that they have at the beginning of where the line would normally form. My husband, daughter and I ordered regular sizes of Penne Rosa (gluten free) for my daughter, Alfredo MontAmore for myself and Steak Stroganoff for my husband. My husband and I each had a side to our pasta: cucumber and tomato salad. I was surprised by the total of $30.00. And since we had our order to go, once we returned home, and we opened up our containers, I was sadly disappointed. It really wasn't worth the time to go there and the money we spent. We will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Literally the worst fast food experience of my life, save for any food poisoning I may have blocked from my memory. It started with the cashier missing our order: I ordered the Pan Noodles without carrots, since I'm allergic. My partner order Pad Thai with chicken.  Upon turning toward the beverage area, we found nary a water cup. Another minute of hovering back at the register yielded us some cups from the manager at a different register. Let's not get started on the UI for getting water from the \"smart\" Coke machines: that wasn't Noodles' fault.  Looking to freshen up our waters, we opened the lemon container to find no lemons. Great. Alright, so we grabbed some paper-wrapped chopsticks and headed to the dining area. The room was maybe 1/3 filled. None of the remaining tables, 14 of them in all, had been bussed. We sat down at the least dirty table and waited. A couple tables over, an employee sat down for their break... at the next least dirty table.  Food time! Look! There are carrots in my entree. And no chicken in my partners'! Quel surprise! The server graciously took my plate back and arrived later with appropriately prepared food. Most empty tables remained unchanged.  I grab my chopstick package, only to find it was already ripped open. I walk the litter-strewn floor back to the beverage area, where I find a pristine chopstick package among the many already-open ones."}
{"text":"First timer.....service was professional, courteous, and took time explaining the menu with us. Ordered Japanese Pan Noodles....service was good, food flavor was fair to good, food was dry, (needed more moisture), spices appeared to be from a packet??? For fast food noodle restaurant it was worth the money it was fair....will try another restaurant."}
{"text":"Food - This was one of the first places I noticed that you actually had to order meat separately from your noodle dish, so I guess it's a nice choice for vegetarians. I went with the trio, with udon/chicken/thai curry soup. I really liked what I ate, but the serving size could've been just a bit bigger.  Price - For a nice, casual place, the food is worth what you pay for, but like I said above, portion can be upped a bit.  Overall - I will definitely be coming back to this place later on to try out other noodle dishes. (Not mac n cheese though)"}
{"text":"I dropped by here because I was familiar with Noodles & Company back in SF. This place is consistent and clean. The staff was friendly and even recommended some noodles to my girlfriend and her brother. I ended up getting the Spaghetti With Meatballs and also garlic bread on the side. I waited maybe 10 minutes it was a busy night (we went around 8pm). I really enjoyed the noodles. It was great and the meatballs tasted very good all together. The bread was fantastic! It wasn't too cheesy or too garlicky I really enjoyed it and almost ordered another order! It is a bit pricier I will say compared to other \"fast food\" areas (I paid around 16 bucks for all this plus a root beer). I enjoyed it overall though and know that places like this are safe to go to because of my familiarity with the menu regardless in Arizona or California!"}
{"text":"This was my first try at Noodles & Company and I was less than satisfied. I work nearby and requested a pick up order with two other coworkers who frequent this location. They had mixed reviews and said it was hit or miss, I needed something soft to eat so I figured nothing beats noodles. WRONG. I ordered a truffle Mac that arrived with half the noodles completely dry, with no sauce. Luckily i was told about the lack of sauce in advance by a coworker.. HOWEVER, what came with my meal in a small separate container was a brown thick substance. I know with these chain restaurants most of your stuff comes in bags or was frozen or whatever but I paid over $15 for a poor excuse for \"Truffle\" Mac and cheese. After working in the food industry as a manager for over 6 years I know there was no excuse for that I picked up that night. This is JUST feedback. Because I won't ever be back to this or any other location."}
{"text":"Warm, tasty food with at least FOUR Vegan options!! We came for the food but came back more often for Bill. Unsurpassed customer service every time. He's worth the visit. I know no mistakes will be made in keeping my dish Vegan when he's on duty and I like having that comfort."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm a noodle fan.. love all noodles and pastas!!  I'm so glad this place is so close to where I usually stay in Pickering!    We tried the Beef Stroganoff and I had the Korean Spicy Noodles. The former was delicious and very cheesy. They latter had a bit too much sauce, but the spice kick was amazing! I think they could use more veggies in the Korean spicy noodles as with any tossed asian noodles normally have more veggies tossed in. But I still enjoyed it a lot! The portions are great for one person and the ingredients are well mixed so you get a bit of everything in every bite.   The place is very clean and the staff nice. I like the open kitchen concept. It's like fast food place with the fountain drinks but you can easily see how people would go for a nice wine and pasta dinner (Yes.. they serve wine!). I kinda like how it's a mix. Cool concept but maybe needs better execution :)   I can't wait to go back and try every single noodle/pasta dish! :) I'll get the photos posted here as I do! They have an awesome mac and cheese special going on and I think I'll go for the alfredo next. Italian and Asian mix..whats not to love about it?"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the taste quality of the food.  They are a new store and I've tried the Mac & Cheese (during the free promotion) and the Pad Thai with Tofu (6.99 + 3.99).  Both times I was disappointed, food was bland, I had to load up on hot sauce just to get some flavour and it did not taste authentic to me.  Front staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I think that Noodles & Company is one of my favorite \"fast food\" chains, right up with Panera Bread. This is a great place for (relatively) cheap warm meal. So far, I've had the Beef Stroganoff, and the Curry Thai Noodles, and can recommend both of them. I have heard from other the Italian dishes here are not that terrific. But, I have yet to form an opinion on that!  Overall, I think this is among healthiest fast food you're gonna get out. These places are packed at lunch time, so try to get there a few minutes early for lunch!"}
{"text":"My friend and I love the noodles and company chain and were extremely disappointed with our experience tonight. I found a label in my noodles, and she found a long dark hair in her mac and cheese (shes blonde). All in all, very poor."}
{"text":"Noodles & Co is a perfectly good place to grab a quick bite, especially if you have kids in tow.  I eat there regularly.  But I don't love the food.  Portions have gotten smaller and the quality of the recipes has declined over time, as they've streamlined their system -- but the kitchen is clean, consistent and quick, and the service is fantastic given the fast-food format.  I'd give two stars to the food, and four stars to the format, location and service."}
{"text":"It's been 5 years since I've been here ya'll!  The last time I was here I bit down on what appeared to be a rusty piece of metal resembling a fish hook.  However, because we like to live life on the edge we decided to go here again this last weekend.    I didn't have any noodle dishes this time though, I tried the strawberry spinach salad minus the blue cheese and bacon.  It was really, really good.  Everything tasted fresh and the balsamic fig dressing was delicious.   My dining companion and the minor had the Indonesian noodle bowl with tofu, and the thai bowl.  They both seemed to enjoy their dishes.    Guess what?  No one got forked with a piece of metal this time!!!  Indications for going back look good."}
{"text":"This is a nice Noodles in Sun Prairie's newest ever expanding shopping center. It's kind of strange to have another noodle place right next to Mac's Mac & Cheese, but whatever I guess.  Because I am a spooky middle-aged hag from outer space, I have a tendency to inadvertently disperse groups of people with my very presence. So was the case this afternoon when I approached a group of young employees standing behind the register. They all scattered in different directions. Only one of them was brave enough to approach and help me pick up my to-go order that I had placed online.   The whole process was smooth, from ordering online, to walking into the store, to spooking the employees at the register.   The food was good. I ordered Pad Thai with tofu. They actually give you quite a bit of food. I'm glad I didn't double up on that tofu.  Salute!"}
{"text":"John is the man! Took our complicated order and cooked it as well. food turned out great! Would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We've tried this place 4 times. 3 out of 4 were terrible (the last time we ended up just throwing it away). One time it was just okay. Service is also okay."}
{"text":"A solid place to grab a quick and healthy meal. The menu is broken down into various cuisines be it: American, Asian, Italian and I think there is one more but I am drawing a blank. I generally go with the Japanese Pan Noodles. Which is udon noodles, broccoli, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, I add steak (proteins are an extra charge) with a nice garnish of bean sprouts and black sesame seeds. The \"regular\" serving is large enough to get me through the afternoon and even make me skip my afternoon snack.The pad thai is also good, a bit sweet so I add some sriracha.  When I went this week they had a new fancy drink machine I had never seen before. It featured a touch screen and you choose what drink you want, I am not going to lie I was confused by this at first. I felt like an older person fighting technology :("}
{"text":"This place is located at marketplace. Their service is effective and efficient as I went to in Minnesota. Price is reasonable. Taste is good. If you want fast and half \" authentic\" Italian pasta, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"To put it bluntly, this place is just OK. They claim that you can customize your dish, but the only options I could see where a choice of meat, at an additional charge. Both my fiancé and myself ordered the Spicy Korean Beef noodles, which were too spicy and lacking dimension. My future brother-in-law ordered the Pesto Cavatappi and a side of mac and cheese. The pesto was by far the best thing I tasted, making me wish I ordered that instead. But the mac and cheese was dismal, merely spiral pasta topped with half melted shredded cheese. I would consider coming back for the pesto, or to try something seasonal. Although, it's unlikely, since there's so many alternative restaurants to dine at."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of different noodles: spaghetti and meatballs, pad thai, pesto cavatappi, japanese pan noodles. They offer a bunch of variety. The prices are alright, but the portions are slightly on the smaller side, and some of the choices don't include any meat unless you pay extra. Service is quick, and they have a free style coke machine."}
{"text":"First time here! Ordered the regular size Penne Rosa-no meat. I scrolled through the reviews before the food arrived and was expecting to be disappointed. When I saw the bowl I will admit that it looked like an extremely small portion for the regular size, but it was actually just enough! I am walking away feeling full and satisfied. The pasta itself was delicious and had a nice little kick to it. I definitely want to come back and try a few more things. Fast service and good prices."}
{"text":"I have come here many times because my friend lives right over here and it has always been a great experience. I want to give a special shoutout to Carol because she is always such a nice and positive server whenever I am here and I thought she deserved a shoutout :)"}
{"text":"Went twice last week.  This is I think their first foray into Canada, I didn't even realize it was a chain until I saw one in Maryland a few weeks ago.  Unlike most places in the PATH, this isn't a takeout only place, you can sit down, eat from actual bowls/plates, with actual silverware, and it's pretty cheap!  They literally mean noodles. All the dishes are based on them, but it runs a gamut from spaghetti & meatballs (and the meatballs are excellent!) to mac and cheese to thai hot pot to Indonesia influenced noodle flavours. Lots of choose from and lots of protein options to go with them.  They seem to have dealing with volume down, they clear lines pretty quickly.   The server the first time stressed to us that the \"regular\" size is a much better deal, and that they'll happily provide a \"to go\" container for leftovers. Seemed to make sense looking at the size of the two bowls, though I haven't compared the portions themselves yet."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Noodles & Co! Their food is fresh and delicious, portions are huge and you won't let disappointed! This was our first time there and my wife and I both had the Penne Rosa.  It had a slight kick but wasn't too spicy (just enough for flavor). The staff is also incredibly friendly! We will be back!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical to try this place since the reviews were not great. However, the food was great, the manager was friendly and dining room was clean. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the vegetarian options at Noodles & Company. The Japanese Pan Noodles with the Tomato Basic Bisque is my personal favourite. The Pesto Cavatape is great too.   Restaurant is clean, service is quick, and overall a good place for a quick meal at any time of the day."}
{"text":"Great service and smiles from all the staff. Seemed like for once an establishment with employees that like their job. Foods good too!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once, but it was enough to make me not want to go back again.  I had just dropped my boyfriend off at the Truax campus and decided to get myself something to eat. It was extremely busy when I went inside to order, so the wait was fairly long. I ordered a caesar salad and the wisconsin mac & cheese, then took it over to the school where I sat in the lobby while I waited for my boyfriend to get out of class. When I opened it up, I was disappointed with everything. The croutons on the caesar salad were greasy and burnt, and the mac & cheese was so liquidy that it was more of a soup than mac & cheese.  Furthermore, the staff weren't very friendly and cared more about getting my money and getting me out of there. This was a few years ago, so things could be different now, but I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"Super yummy concept. So many options to choose from. I'm a huge pasta fan so didn't know where to start. Got the mac n cheese with chicken. I also got 3 potstickers. The flavor was really good but the potstickers themselves were cold and kinda rubbery. The mac n cheese with grilled chicken came out. It was delicious. I thought it would be dry because of the chicken but they added more shredded cheese! It was amazing! Will definitely come back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with this place. I had a large order and every dish was just ehhh. Butter noodles were bland, my son had the Wisconsin steak sandwich and didn't care for it, the Mac and cheese was okay but not very cheesy except for on top. The pad Thai had good flavor but the noodles were soggy. I also had some sort of Asian noodle dish with beef, that was okay as well but nothing I would want to order again. Don't think I'll come back to this place. It wasn't horrible, but nothing I tried made me want to order from there again."}
{"text":"Came in this plaza and discovered this gem burried among random stores! just saw this place now after being here  with just bp and mc donald's  standing out! ordered the mac and cheese and it was tasty and korean meatballs yum! portion is big enough for 2!"}
{"text":"Noodles & Company is a (new?) chain restaurant across the US offering East meets West fusion Noodle dishes. This location in Middleton was my first experience.   I walked into Noodles & Company with an expectation for Americanized Chinese food. I was surprised to find them to be not very Chinese at all. Their menu offers mostly Italian American pasta dishes and a few Asian noodles dishes. I ordered their Thai Curry Noodles and Potstickers.   The noodles were nicely done with fresh ingredients. The noodles themselves were perfectly cooked to be al dente. Their potstickers nicely done with a nice firm outer skin. The potstickers were served with a nice vinegar chili sauce that complemented the potstickers well.   This a fast food place that offers quick and efficient service without compromising the quality of the food. I wish more fast food places would do this instead of just serving cheaper foods. The seating area is large enough for bigger families and groups without feeling overcrowded. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I was slightly grumpy picking up my online order when the cashier told me they didn't have any rice crispy treats.  The employee snapped at me. I suppose I could have deserved it, but the manager stepped right in and was fantastic. Can't really rate that experience low."}
{"text":"i am a big fan of noodles and they usually have great staff. i called earlier today to ask if they had any vegan options and when i talked to the lady on the phone, she seemed more than happy to help. she put me on hold and i waited for at least 10 minutes and got no answer. i ended up just hanging up - i was very unimpressed"}
{"text":"Best Mac & Cheese I've ever had. I've tried several other things on the menu but the mac & cheese will always be my favorite. Great service as well!:)"}
{"text":"I enjoy Noodles & Company. It's a nice chain with consistent offerings that change up from time to time and the staff is always friendly. I stopped in this Charlotte location in January. My sister was in labor across the street and I knew it'd be a while so I took a break. I ordered my Pad Thai, a large rice krispy treat, and also ordered a glass of wine.   When I went to sit down, a young man brought me my wine. When he asked how I was, I admitted to being rather emotional because my Grandfather had just died and my sister was having a bad experience. He was a bit taken aback by my honesty, but gave me the nicest smile and a generous pour. I told him not to worry and said his smile made my day. I sat there reading and thinking about life and he stopped by before I left to make sure I was okay. Talk about quality care. The Pad Thai wasn't the best I'd ever had, but it was good and both my Mom and I enjoyed it back at the hospital over the long night we endured. I'd return to this location simply for the quality care and kindness, not to mention prompt care."}
{"text":"1. No hair nets, caps, or anything. As a result, there was a dark curly hair in my food - could have been a pube... Ew. I knew I was bound for trouble when the person handling money cooked my food. SMH you should always have a separate person to handle and cook food to keep that area sanitized.  2. Prior to discovering the hair, the food wasn't half bad. But $9 for a small ramen noodle with 2 chunks of steak and soup the size of a tea cup.... cray cray  3. Worst Wi-Fi connection you have ever experienced.  Eat elsewhere....."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place on campus. I got there at 6:30 and the dining room was a mess, I obviously had just missed rush. I ordered 3 items, no meat and no drink and the bill was $15. When I questioned that I explained I had wanted the small bowl, she hadn't ask, and the side soup. It came down to $10. I still felt that was pretty high. She seemed extremely annoyed that I was bothering her with this, and I kind of wanted to tell her \"honey, if you don't like your job, work someplace else.\" The food was just okay. At that price I would have liked enough to take home, but, the small portions were pretty measly and I finished it there. Someone had dumped an entire order of macaroni and cheese in the middle of the floor, and I got to stare at it while I ate. At no point did anyone come clean it up while I was there. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business. Their gimmick is that they do noodles, spanning many ethnicities and cuisines. However, I had hoped that they actually try to customize the noodle dishes to the tastes. Instead, each noodle dish is assembled together, noodles being the base and whatever ethnically appropriate veggies and meat are mixed in. The problem is that noodles are not like, say, burritos, in which mix-and-match assembly works. Noodles work only when the flavor is cooked into the noodles. Assembling it together like that results in predominantly bland noodles at best and their mac and cheese at worst. The mac and cheese was literally a bowl of elbow pasta with store-bought shredded cheese thrown on top. (And I know that it's store-bought - there is no way that hand-shredded cheese would curl in that distinctive and uniform way).   Also, unrelated to how their entire restaurant concept does not work - they seem to skimp on the sauce. I got what should be a simple and hard-to-screw-up bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, and they gave me a piddling amount of sauce. Just an overall exasperating experience."}
{"text":"Great place for carb overload. It's the panera of pasta! Diverse selections and quick turnaround. Limited seating but usually able to steal a table. The Italian selections are my favorite but tried the spicy peanut noodles for the first time. Also offer wine and domestic beers. Another great addition to the various restaurants around market square"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have seen construction going on in Noodle & Co's tidy corner of market square and were anxious to try it out.  I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet \"chili\" sauce. There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.  The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, \"Asian\", \"Mediterranean\", and \"American\" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.  Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.  All that said, the prices are probably fair, especially affordable if you go sans meat/tofu although I would really appreciate an extra veggie option."}
{"text":"It's such a shame this place has poor management.  I used to love getting salads from here until the day my meal was inedible because of store error.  This could have been remedied by simply refunding my money.  The general manager left a message stating she had done so, yet this refund never materialized.  When I called to inform the manager of the missing refund she argued with me that she had processed it the same day.  No idea what the gain is by lying about it.  I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service and gives out way smaller portion sizes than any other noodles I've ever been too. Today I ordered 3 small buttered noodles and literally had a child's portion in it compared to the others. When I asked the clerk why the huge difference in size when they should be the same she responded the noodles were stuck together. Really I'm doubting that. Would it be so hard to give me some more noodles? Geez I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Seems to be more and more issues with this location. Today noodles were very undercooked. Sent them back and new dishes of noodles were the same undercooked and gross. Won't be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I went to this place in Chicago on vacation a few times. it was really good and I got Mac and cheese everytime. I went to this location, and it was amazing as usual!! very cheap also"}
{"text":"First time there today (I got a mailer with some coupons and decided to try it out)   I placed my order online and was ready in 8 minutes! Very fast!   In my opinion, pretty affordable place. My large bowl was $9   I ordered the Mac and cheese with buffalo chicken and was very happy with it. I used a coupon to get a free app and I ordered the Korean meatballs. Holy smokes! Tasty!!! But spicy. Everything was cooked well and loaded full of flavor.   I'm looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Nice spot for anyone from 2 to 100.....good variety, family friendly.  My personal favorites are the Wisconsin Mac'n'Cheese and the Pesto Cavatappi."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. We tried the Pad Thai with shrimp and it came out yummy and warm. We also had the garlic bread as well and it was really good too. Price wise might be a lil expensive but it was good food overall. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Absolute worse experience ever. I don't think I have ever had a manger yell at me in any establishment until meeting Elliot! I explained to him his cashier was nice nasty and rather then taking the feedback and being thankful someone pointed out he said that's just how she is. Then he was pissed I asked for an off menu item and after I told him I did not need any further explanation he continued to make a scene in front of his other guest. It was humiliating and horrible.this is what the service industry has come too?"}
{"text":"They gave my boss burnt noodles and forgot the sauce.... but my food is always good..."}
{"text":"First time here and will not be back the udon noodles were dry so was chicken and salad was scarce. Not pleased at all"}
{"text":"Noodles categories are comfort food, Italian, and Asian Fusion. Yet none of these are done justice. I've given up on this location but last week ended up with it again after a year or so break since my guest suggested it. I can't come up with one redeeming factor to convince you to eat here. Maybe if all in your party want a different cuisine, like if one wants Mac and cheese and one wants spaghetti and meatballs and one wants pad Thai...maybe you could go here. Prepare for disappointment. If you don't mind paying a lot for a little food that is questionable in quality. After a few times having meatballs and feeling something gritty I quit it and went with the Indonesian Peanut Sauté + chicken. Not once was there ever peanut with my entree! They just skimp on ingredients in general. And the problems mentioned in other reviews, yeah, I second those!"}
{"text":"The manager and team are great!  We are here on national mac and cheese day and they are busy but so efficient!  Food was great and service was perfect!    In a nutshell this was great food and service- I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"So I am toren. today is the second trip back to the Noodle company. The young man that took our order was super nice and helpful to pick out a dish. But then... I got my food. There was a hair. I picked out the throw it. The food was that good. BUT then there was a second hair. So I took it up and they said oh sorry and they would replace it. I got the food back and it was like half the size of the portion I gave them back. So that sucks. I am sure it is not the young men more so a company policy to do that crap. But I am toren now cause the food is soon good, but that crap rubs me the wrong way. NOT COOL. So I am taking a star away. Improve you customer satisfaction. The hair in the food was your employees not wearing a hair net and having long hair. So give me a full portion back. Even if it is my last bite. That is how you take care of peolple... and then get some hair nets for the kids in the back. And try to reduce that mistake. Don't be taking your cheap self out on me. I did not tell you to skip the hair nets. Buy some. And although the food is super good, I probably won't come back to this location unless they make good on my meal they ripped me off for. Just my two cents. Try it out, the food is good. Hope you don't get hair in your noodles."}
{"text":"I always use the on-line ordering. Simple and easy. Cuts down on wait time. I dig their thai curry soup. Nice and zesty."}
{"text":"Lost my order took 40 mins to get lunch. Staff is useless especially front order chick who can't put orders in. Shape up also got my order wrong really screwed it up!"}
{"text":"This place has great prices, and you can have it made the way you like it.   Pretty standard faire; noodles, sides, salads....   you can't go wrong here.   If you want to have your mind blown, this probably isn't your place.     If you want a good non-fast food meal at a reasonable price, these guys have it down.    I'll be back.  A-OK!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here.  I went with a friend of mine from work.  I had the Japanese Pan Noodles and she had Penne Rosa.  I really wanted to like this place.  I was excited to try it out.  However, we were both disappointed in our food and experience.    When we first walked in, we both noticed that the floor was very sticky.  It was like someone spilled soda on the entire floor and didn't clean it up.  Even the customer in front of us commented to the cashier so I know it wasn't just us.  In fact, our shoes kind of stuck to the concrete outside when we were leaving.  It was sticky throughout the restaurant: just inside the door, by the soda machine and down the hallway to the bathrooms.    Then, there was a family of 4 or 5 with a child in a highchair as the same time as us.  Obviously, toddlers of that age are messy.  But I was surprised when the girl went over to clean up the tables when the family left and she left the napkins and spilled pasta on the floor.  We were there for 2.5 hours and she (nor anyone else) never went to clean up the floor after that family.  It looked pretty bad.  Maybe that's why the floor was so sticky as well :(    As far as our food goes, neither of us were very happy.  We thought the portions were very small.  As I stated earlier, it was our first time there.  The cashier had asked if I wanted steak with my noodles but I chose not to.  Knowing now what I didn't know then, I should've ordered the meat.  There just wasn't enough food.  She did offer to give me extra carrots and broccoli as I opted to substitute the mushrooms.  However, the carrots were large, undercooked pieces.  And as stated by another reviewer, there was no spice in there whatsoever.  My friend thought that her penne was dry and also commented on the small size.  I may try this place again because as stated in the beginning, I really wanted to like this place.  But on my first impression, I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"This place opened up near home recently so I just had to try it.  As their name and menu suggests, they have all kinds of noodles - Italian and Asian. They also have soups, salads, sandwiches, and stir-frys.  I decided to try the Bangkok Curry noodles with Chicken and a side order of Korean meatballs. Neither tasted very authentic but not bad. The seasoning was a little heavy handed, making the flavour a bit tangy.  It was good enough to be worthy of another visit. Maybe I'll try something Italian next..."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my visit. The food and service were horrible. The Penne Rosa with chicken had to much salt. The cheesy bread that like garlic salt and Italian seasoning. Yuck.  They need to hire new staff."}
{"text":"Our family of three had a horrible dinner at San Tan location of Noodles & Company yesterday. Our order has 3 dishes, none of them was well-cooked, including Kid's Meal Mac & Cheese. They charged us for 3 dishes, but brought out only 2 bowls after waiting for 15 minutes, completely forgot mine. After another 10-minute wait, my dish eventually came out but it was only 80% cooked, tasted gooey like eating glue sticks. At this time, my husband said his green curry was between raw and medium, like chewing hard plastics in mouth. He took it out to have it re-cooked, they made a new one for him. However, I tried some Mac & Cheese for my daughter, it was \"glue sticks\" as well. She did not want to eat it any more after taking five bites. It took us a long time to get our food, and they all taste like junks, totally wasted our time and money."}
{"text":"This was one of my go to chains when I was Chicago so I'm happy to see one right in downtown Pittsburgh.  I got the opportunity to try it out today although I figured I knew what to expect since franchises try to be consistent in quality and taste regardless of their location.    This is just how I remember it.  It's affordable, relatively quick, and tasty.  Please note the order b/c if you ask me are their better tasting places out there - sure.  Are there cheaper places our there - yes, and are their faster places out there - of course.  But to have the trifecta - well that does take a little more effort than having one or another of those qualities.    Which is why this place gets 4 stars - it probably helps that it's also close to where I work."}
{"text":"Hello again my food friends! Jill, Xander and I found this great little noodle joint in Charlotte by chance and loved it! Kids choices are available for the less adventurous little guys so no worries there. I had a bowl of Thai Chicken Soup and the flavors were balanced and robust. Lemongrass and coconut come through nicely and do not overpower, slightly sweet but a savory soup for sure. Jill had the Spicy Korean Beef noodle bowl and it was amazing as well. Beef was very tender and the spice of the dish was just right, keep a napkin close for your nose! Veggies had a nice crisp crunch which paired nicely with the soft texture of the noodles. Cilantro finishes the flavor and is just wonderful. Restaurant was clean and the service was prompt and pleasant. We will return when we are in Charlotte for sure! I dropped one star for the mens bathroom, we were there right at opening, should be cleaner than it was for no one having been in there yet."}
{"text":"The service and food is great. Had the Pad Thai and it was delicious and I also like the decor of the place."}
{"text":"Tried one of their dishes and it was ok.  Nothing special.  Portion was small.  Overpriced.  I love noodle dishes & was really looking forward to trying this place.  I won't go back.  The staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place. Super quick, fresh, and great service - not to mention the portions are perfect and all reasonably priced. You can get a great, filling lunch, made with healthy and natural ingredients for less than $10 - or you can get triple bypass from any of the many mc-wendy-kings nearby for about the same - it's your call. And the employees at those establishments aren't going to walk around offering refills and boxing up your left ova lunch, the way that this place will."}
{"text":"I love Noodles and Company. In my opinion it's one of the best \"fast casual\" restaurants out there. One great deal is \"the trio\". You get noodles, a protein, and a small side salad. If you get a full bowl of noodles it's pretty chock full of calories but with the Trio you can eat a little more healthfully."}
{"text":"It's a Noodles and Company, so I wouldn't say the food tastes different here, but I prefer other locations, if solely for the parking lot.  Getting in and out of the parking lot can be a bit of a mess--especially going out if you want to head west on Mineral Point.  If you want to go west when leaving, I suggest going through the back parking lot and you can make your way to Gammon.  This location always feel a little hectic.  As for the food, yes, there is consistency with other Noodles locations if you're familiar. I prefer the Pesto Cavatappi, Mac&Cheese (although I usually regret this a bit after finishing because it's so rich), and the Pad Thai. The mailing list is also great if you go to Noodles regularly, as they do sometimes email coupons."}
{"text":"The first impression I had was how dirty the lobby was at 8pm and had no customers (not the first time I have seen it dirty at a slow time). The place always is loud and usually I don't mind that but I can always hear the people in the kitchen talking about the oddest things. The price here is quite expensive for paste. I had the mac and cheese that they offer with chicken. Honestly,  I could of gone to winco and bought 38 cent mac and cheese that had equivalent taste. I do appreciate their customer service, the best thing they have there. Majority of the employee's are friendly. You are better off going to Macaroni grill next door, it might actually be cheaper. Also the soda machine is always missing something, do not buy a drink."}
{"text":"I always ask to have tweaks to the menu and staff is always very accommodating. I like the chicken warmed in the salad dressing on the side. It is a pleasure to have service given with a smile. The manager Scott runs a good crew. It is one of my favorite lunch spots"}
{"text":"Either food is really good or meh depending on what you order. I don't their thai variety noodle. However all their American-Italian noodle bowls taste very good. Stick with the more American food on their menu and you can't go wrong! They have lots of Vegan options too."}
{"text":"Noodles and Co does it again. I'm telling you, their Togo service couldn't be any more flawless... it's ready the second I walk through the door, my food is hot even once I get it back to work, and it's of course, so delish. Never disappointed with this one."}
{"text":"The food is great, however the last 2 times we have been here, we have found hair in our food. The first time my husband spoke with the manager and she said they aren't required to wear hair nets. Eww! We are pretty bummed because we do enjoy the food, however we can't bear the thought of more hair in our food."}
{"text":"When I'm not eating stir fry at YC's I'm eating it here. The food has always been good here and the prices are very reasonable. They also have a wide variety of foods to choose from. This is nit picky but my biggest complaint is how expensive it is to add extra vegetables."}
{"text":"Having a couple of these back in California I had an idea on what to expect. Located across Arrowhead mall in one of the plazas. This place has many different varieties of noodles. From Japanese pan style noodles to buffalo Mac and cheese. The service was good and extremely quick. We tried the pesto cavatappi, buffalo Mac with a side of regular Mac and Caesar salad. Overall the food was good, nothing too spectacular. If your a noodle fanatic then I feel you'd enjoy this place. I would say if you haven't been here, give it a shot. You might find something that could WoW you. And if you do let me know!"}
{"text":"I'm in Arizona for work and one of my coworkers brought me here bc she loved this chain when she lived in Milwaukee. It lived up to her hype! I thought by the name that it was just Asian but not the case. You can choose an Asian, Italian, lettuce, Mac and cheese or curry bowl of noodles. I got the Japanese udon noodles and they were perfection! The marinade steak had an odd flavor but next time I wouldn't get any meat bc the noodles are the star of this show."}
{"text":"Before undertaking the task of cleaning our duplex out, I needed to carbo-load. What better place to do so than Noodles!  Yes it's franchise but I still enjoy it. Penne Rosa, Japanese Pan Noodles, Pesto Cavatappi (I think they still have that...) have been my comfort carbs for many moons.  This location shares a building with TC Nails, Chocolate Shoppe and Starbucks, so one can cover many food/snack/mani pedi bases while over here.   The parking lot is tiny but by the evening the Starbucks line isn't as...prominent. So finding a spot isn't difficult.  Long live Noodles!"}
{"text":"I actually fell in love with this chain when I lived in Minneapolis. Was very happy when they moved to Champaign.  Now I can at least get it when I come home.  Parking can be difficult since this is located in campustown, more-so when school is session, of course.  Frequently there is a line, so you may have to wait.  They do move through the ordering line quickly though.  They will give you a number and then either bring you your food (if you are staying in) or call you up (if you are doing take-out).   i really like that you can pick whatever noodles/soup with whatever meat option you desire. I think there used to be a menu option that I got, but it doesn't exist anymore.  The last time I ate there, I got the pad thai- which was terrible.  I don't recommend that at all.  My parents love the thai curry soup...especially when under-the-weather. The bread is really good.  And their rice krispie treats are nice and gooey."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times and it has been very hit or miss. My go-to is their pesto pasta but sometimes it's very chewy and oily. My boyfriend likes their spicy noodles well enough but it's not anything incredible. Their mac n cheese tastes like a frozen dinner honestly, it's not very flavorful :/. I had great experiences at the Raleigh location but just haven't found the same quality to be here. I hope they'll step it up in the future because I was very excited when this place opened and want it to be great!"}
{"text":"This is the worst noodles location ever. Just ordered a caesar salad for $8 and all they did was take out a prepackaged salad and give it to me. Gas station quality for double the price. What happened to cooking the chicken and sticking it on the salad?"}
{"text":"This location is the bomb. I work in the mall so I visit them frequently. The employees are super nice, especially Heather! They are always helpful and friendly. The pasta is pretty good, and when I'm burned out on the other fast food in the mall, it really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Positives things about this restaurant:  When you walk in, the menu with pictures is posted on the wall. It is was easy to read with clear pricing and very descriptive. After we looked at the menu for about 5 minutes, one of the employees came over and asked if she could answer any questions for us. She was very patient, knowledgeable, and helpful. We soon decided and approached the counter where you order. The cashier was personable and very nice. They had waitresses/busers that brought our food and helped with anything they could. They were very attentive and willing to help. They fixed my meal in a timely manner and were very polite. Very nice drink machine with immense amount of choices. They had a drink for everyone.   The areas that I felt were negative was the cashier was new and did not know the menu very well and rang up our drinks incorrectly. When my food came out(Japanese Pan Fried Noodles), the noodles and steak was burnt very badly. The food was not amazing. It was not awful but it was just below average. I feel like the menu was limited for a specialty restaurant. Although drinks were a positive, there were drinks you could not get because they were out. I do not know if this was due to Light Up night and they were unable to refill them or if they just had not done it. Pricing was not very good. Cafeteria style and uncomfortable chairs and tables(i prefer booths).  Some improvement would be a change in the atmosphere, seating upgrades, better food quality and selection, and have drinks on stock when needed.  I would not come here again because it does not really stand out among the other establishments in the same area. This restaurant is located in Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, so there are multiple restaurants in the square and the only reason we chose this restaurant because we decided it was the most kid-friendly restaurant at which we had not already eaten.   *The most important improvement would be food quality because if the menu stayed the same and the food they had improved I would be willing to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Love this place. Use to always eat at a noodles and company when I visit Missouri I'm so happy there is one here now. If you like spicy. I recommend the Indonesia. Peanut with chicken. Everything is really fresh and good. Our cashier tonight was really nice she was very helpful. Even checked on us to make sure we liked what we got. I will be coming here a lot."}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting food I've ever ate in my life. I got the Japanese stir fry with udon and 1. The udon was burned 2. It was flavorless with a hint of spice... Don't ask 3. It was so dry 4. Most importantly it was cold.  This was the biggest waste of calories ever. I will never eat here again. I want to force vomit it was so bad. I'm really upset since that was supposed to be my lunch now I have to go back to work with the screw face because my lunch sucked."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, decent prices. Never had a bad experience. The food is always fresh and plentiful, with great taste. However, I am writing this review based on my  customer service experience. Sharnise is a treasure at the restaurant. Spectacular customer service, smiling face, and offers menu suggestions. She even came to check on us as she passed by the table. With such a positive attitude like she possesses, I see her going far, and hope the company recognizes the great employee they have!"}
{"text":"The staff and service were awful. There was also an employee who's rear-end was hanging out of her pants the entire time she was out delivering food. It was disgusting and not what you want to see while trying to enjoy a meal. The Alfredo Bowl noodles were undercooked and the sauce was super watery and the only flavor I tasted was noodle water. The spinach and tomatoes in the bowl were cold and uncooked which also caused the whole bowl to be room temperature rather than a hot meal. I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company is a chain restaurant, yes, but as far as I'm concerned it's a welcome addition to the available array of Oakland eateries.  It's kind of like Chipotle for noodles--you pick from a menu that has menu noodle dishes that fall into American, Asian, or Mediterranean categories.  I have tried a couple different things here and so far everything has been pretty good.  The Penne Rosa is definitely my favorite!  The only downside is that the restaurant is ALWAYS packed and pretty loud--but things move quickly, even so.  If you're in Oakland and feel like you've tried everything around, stop here.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I got the pesto cavatapi with a side salad and a drink and it was less than $10... How can you beat that? I really enjoyed my food. I'm definitely gonna try the Mac n cheese next time.  The small size was a great portion for me."}
{"text":"First we were ignored whe we came un. Then the cashier finally decided to wait on us.  It is sad when u walk into a restaurant and 3 employees can't explain  the menu to a customer. I ask a question and no one could explain what a symbol meant on the main menu. So I must left.  They were still arguing when i walked out. I hope they find the answer. It was not a hard question"}
{"text":"Hey, if you have a big sign requesting to order online, maybe you should have the app working.  It's busy today at the mall and I have to get to work.  Tried to order ahead with my family only to get the entire order denied because the app isn't working.  Now I have to wait in a long line AFTER we took the time to look through the app to order.  To boot--employees don't even care to try to fix the app or tell a member of leadership. Thanks for wasting my time.  This is the most inconsistent N&C I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"I came today for the soft opening knowing what the food is like, considering I've been there before I knew what I was walking into. The service was pretty good they need their practice but I won't belittle those that are clearly still training, however the food for as many people as there were came out lightning quick and was delivered with ease. Just like all the other locations they are fast, friendly and accommodating to all their guests. The kitchen, especially for a soft opening, was a smooth operating machine. I recommend for all noodle lovers alike to come try this place if you haven't already. Their Alfredo montamore has a slight kick which just builds the flavor even more, the only thing I wished I could try at the soft opening was a soft cookie that looked mouth watering and delicious. I love this place."}
{"text":"When I lived in Minneapolis, Noodles & Co. was one of my favorite quick service restaurants.  So I was thrilled to see a location open up here and went for dinner the same night I found out it was there! It has all the same items as other locations. My favorites are the butter noodles and the mac and cheese. I like to sometimes add meatballs or chicken but the noodles are good on their own too. The service was quick and the people working there were friendly. It's not a huge space and the night I went it was crowded and got very loud. Luckily we found a spot outside but if you sit inside and it's busy just be aware it can get noisy. Otherwise I'm just so excited that now I don't have to go out of town to get my Noodles fix!"}
{"text":"We have waited for this N&C for some time to open. Today we visited this new branch opened on Ray Rd. in Ahwatukee. Well, I can't say that it was worth the wait. Ordered a Pad Thai dish and a pesto pasta dishes from their posted menu, together with two side dishes to accompany our dinner. The Pad Thai wasn't even too hot (spicy) as it should be, had a fish sauce taste to it and was served without the bean sprouts as was advertised. The pesto dish had some pesto flavors but it didn't taste natural or fresh to me, despite their claim to never use microwaves, canned foods, artificial flavors and so on. The pork meat that came with it was OK though. The two sides were mediocre tasting as well, a Thai chicken soup that was too sweet and a Wisconsin Mac and cheese that didn't taste any better than the Kraft one from the grocery store. Well, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us, we don't plan to renew it. Too bad, the location is great..."}
{"text":"Pretty sure someone stole my favorite hat at this restaurant.  The waitress or bus woman or whoever she was grabbed our dishes while we were still sitting in the booth and looked really angry. Zero smiles.  I guess everyone that night working was just in a bad mood.  The food was okay, but after what happened there, I'm never going back.  Blah."}
{"text":"I work right across the square so this is one of the 4 places I eat through the week.   I usually do takeout and my food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.  On the rare occasion that I dine in, staff is always quick to my table and attentive.  *To the defense of the employees and their \"slow\" service because they're not ALL jumping to make your order - not all employees work in all areas, and they will probably get reprimanded for leaving their station. Some days they work different stations.*  Now on to the good stuff!   Originally I would get the spicy spaghetti and meatballs, minus parmesan plus extra meatballs.  I got this dish at least once a week and it always came out correctly and hot.  The staff is always friendly and never seems to mind my obnoxious orders!    However, I recently got a tooth pulled so it's been chicken noodle soup.   Big pieces of chicken, some green things that I don't know because I don't really eat veggies, carrots and hearty noodles! You get two packs of crackers for dipping.  If you get it to go you will need to wait a bit to start because it does come out piping hot! This is definitely my go to soup spot, especially in this weather."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the cheeseburger Mac & cheese, my husband had the BBQ Mac & cheese....both were awesome!  We got the smaller size & I still couldn't finish mine!    Staff was very friendly too...will go back anytime I get the chance!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and value for money. Good place to hang out with friends or come with family as well. Service is quick and good. Thai chicken soup & Japanese pan noodles made my day."}
{"text":"Standard chain in market square. Packed during lunch. For me the menu is weak. But they have been running short promos of new temporary items and they have been ok."}
{"text":"They are aptly named Noodles & co. because all you get are noodles. Did they really need to get so stingy with the vegetables in order to keep their prices in line with the nearby competition?  I ordered the pesto pasta. It tasted good. The cheese was clearly high quality and everything was cooked well. Price was reasonable at just less than $8, probably thanks to the 4 pieces of tomato and maybe 5-6 small slices of mushroom that I got with it. Seriously? Come on. Feel free to charge me another $1-2 and give me some portions that are actually satisfying.  I don't know if it will be any better if you pay the premium to add meat.  On a brighter note, the pasta is cooked fresh so it takes a bit longer to get your food here than most other places, but still fairly quick. It all comes very nicely packaged as well with a high quality plastic container and paper bag. There is also a generous seating area around the corner."}
{"text":"Great tasting Korean spicy noodles. Japanese noodles were great too. Arrive was friendly and fast and the atmosphere was solid. Great value for money too."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite restaurant that's quick and at the same time is going to leave me full. I always get a regular bowl and they serve just the perfect amount. The staff is always great, very friendly and pleasant. I like that they've a patio, which makes it less cramp on the inside and they've side booths too! For some of us that love booths. I always get the Wisconsin Mac and cheese with chicken or the pasta amore, and it's never been disappointing! The pesto is actually really good I've tried it from my husbands plate, but its a little too spicy for my taste. Love everything about the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is terrible. They've messed up my order several times but the food is solid. If you can hit a different location, the service would have to be better."}
{"text":"An average chain restaurant, fast, efficient and the food is good. I tend to have the same things as I like how they prepare it. This store is definitely the better one of the ones in Madison. Their staff is friendly and helpful.  I usually stop here when I don't want to cook as it is convenient and near to where I live. I usually get the penne rosa with extra chicken. I love the slight spiciness in the sauce. Their summer pasta fresca is also a good choice.  One tip, the best thing to have from this place when you are sick is their chicken noodle soup. When I am sick I stop there and stock up on their soup to get me through the days."}
{"text":"A good place to grab a quick bite when in mood for a noodles dish. My recommendation is the Penne Rosa with Parmesan cheese or the new Green Curry with Shrimp. This is my go to place when I am sick as I loadon chicken noodle soup. This location is convenient and fast serving, has free parking."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm going to judge Noodles & Company a little tougher than I normally might because the Thai/Asian market in Oakland is well represented and if you want people's business then you really need to step up your game.  Here is one thing I really appreciate at Noodles and Company - the caloric value is listed for each dish.  Talk about an eye opener - if you don't choose wisely, you better have a date with the gym later in the day because there's a dish on the menu (fettuccine) that is over 1,200 calories.    I had the Bangkok curry on my visit today and I thought the flavor was nice, not overpowering for a curried dish, and it was a nice size portion.  The caloric count wasn't bad and I felt full.    My colleague who dined with me did a soup and salad combo and said that the spicy Caesar chicken sandwich was indeed spicy.  This is not my go to noodle destination, but, it's not on my list of \"don't ever come here again\" noodle places.  I'd describe it as, \"it is what it is\", nothing to write home about but nothing to write a bad review about either."}
{"text":"This was the fastest bowl ever. Didn't wait that long. Used my birthday bowl coupon here and was able to get a protein with it!   Large space and great for families. Located in a nice shopping center next to Starbucks.   Everything was hot but I wish they cooked the spinach. I had to tuck them in under the noodles so that they would eventually cook.   Noodles were cooked perfectly (penne rosa). The suave wasn't too spicy like it usually is which is great for me."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the Pasta Fresca with spaghetti noodles YUM!! Staff is always super friendly and service is quick!!"}
{"text":"Today was the second time I have placed an order online, shown up and been made to wait 15 minutes plus for my order to find out it had been sitting their ready the whole time. I had to ask one of the employees behind the counter if the bag waiting on the back table was my order as I had been standing there for 15 minutes. He wasn't doing anything and it was not busy by any means. I was the only person standing there waiting for my food. There were several other employees that looked at the bag and said nothing. Terrible customer service! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at this place. Very good Penne Rosa pasta and Bangkok Curry. Fresh ingredients and salads. We usually get the trio, includes a side and a meat added to the pasta.  On this visit, 7:15 pm for dinner, the place was a mess. Most tables needed wiping down (did this ourselves) and the floor was gross. macaroni pasta every where"}
{"text":"When there's a long line, simply place your order by calling in from the back of the line and they'll take your order over the phone before everyone else. Everyone just has to wait in line and stare at the cashier as she continuously takes the call. Phone has priority over customers in store.    Then when your to-go order is up, make sure you go through whatever bag is placed on the counter. See, they don't call it out. It just sits on the counter and you have to guess if it's yours.   Then when you go to eat you chicken noodle soup, be sure to bring a bag of cooked vegetables and chicken to add to it. Because you'll realize they should call it noodle in chicken broth soup. One small piece of chicken in a bunch of noodles, no vegetables. I get it! It's called Noodle&Company. I see a lot of noodles and a company that has some growing up to do."}
{"text":"Place is great it has good food at reasonable prices and the management and staff are all nice. Much better than Fazolis ...."}
{"text":"Foods decent. Service is always either fine or terrible. Usually it's just okay- don't expect much. They fuck up orders often though, including forget parts of the meal. A bit overpriced also. If you have a craving for pasta specifically, I guess you could go here, but I'd choose somewhere else on Green Street if you're up for it."}
{"text":"Noodles & company is a good concept.  I'm just not sure if I would be a regular at a joint like this though.  They have a variety of soups, salads and noodles boasting international pedigree.  Although they excel in service and cleanliness, they really lose points on flavour and execution.    We had the steak stroganoff (wayyyyyyy too rich), spicy korean beef bowl (too oily and lacking in any distinctive Korean flavour) and a spaghetti and meatballs kids meal.  Also on the side was a small salad and a vitamin water to drink.  At $32 for this meal, the value is underwhelming for the quality of food you get.  I do like the fact that they served up the regular size noodles in proper bowls.  Portions are large but lacks any kind of balance you would like in a proper meal.  (as mentioned by another review, \"no veggies\" in noodle dishes.)    It wouldn't be my first choice to come back here for lunch when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for dinner before seeing a movie. I wish that I had checked yelp first. He ordered the Korean Beef Noodles and enjoyed it. I had the Thai Green Curry with Shrimp. We also ordered a fountain soda to share. Placing our order was painful. The lady behind the counter was very uninterested in assisting us and seemed irritated that we came in. (There was not many people in the restaurant). Secondly, the fountain machine was out of root beer and Coca Cola. Strike one. The third strike was my curry. My noodles were severely burned in places as was my shrimp. I was able to pull off some of the blackened sheets of funk off of my shrimp, was less successful with the noodles. I just put the crisped and blackened noodles to the side. I didn't ask for a replacement, as I was pretty sure that the next one would be just as bad or worse. The restaurant was not busy at all. I should have taken the hint early and saved my money and my time."}
{"text":"On the whole I enjoy Noodles as a chain, but I can't tell if this location has gone downhill or if my standards have just changed tremendously since I was in college. Maybe a little of both?   Food is pretty standard - I've never found a noticeable difference in flavor or preparation from location to location. This is probably in part due to them weighing ingredients and, I would imagine, the same distributors.   This location has been kind of dirty on my last couple of visits, though. Sticky tables, uncleared tables, condiment bottles that could use a wipe down, and, my favorite, a puddle of something slippery/greasy outside the order pickup window for the kitchen. I nearly went splat while walking past on my way to the staircase and I'm impressed none of the servers did the same.   There hasn't been an infraction so bad I won't return, but I'd prioritize a different location if you can."}
{"text":"Between a two and a three. In general, I am a fan of the Noodles chain. It's quick, you get a lot of food for what you pay, and quality is a step up from fast food. This location did have the best mac and cheese I can recall getting from a Noodles in the last couple of years, so I've opted to rate this location a three, but on our visit the dining room was a mess - crumb-covered tables and dirty dishes waiting to be bussed abound. As we were leaving I did see the cashier making  the rounds trying to clean up a bit. Appreciated, but it would have been nice to sit down in a clean dining room instead of leave to one."}
{"text":"I wish more places like this would open up on our side of town. I'm always looking for healthy options when I don't feel like cooking and always come up short and end up cooking or eating unhealthy. I prefer not to eat bread/pasta and they have an \"in the buff\" alternative with spinach instead of pasta. The entire experience was a pleasant one with the staff being super friendly and helpful. The manager even met us at the door to go over the menu with us. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and waiters are friendly; however, I would only recommend this place if you like the taste of noodles and nothing more.....very lil' flavor."}
{"text":"It's okay I guess. Nothing fantastic and I would consider it a little pricey for what you get.  The truffle mac and cheese is really good but I'm not sure if you can really mess that up. I do not like there Phad Thai. It lacked flavor. I feel a lot of there dishes lack flavor as they try to appeal to the masses."}
{"text":"Tried to see their take on Indonesian noodle. What a disappointment. At $10 you get a snack bowl with pad Thai noodle, bland boiled chicken breast, peanut butter flavor soup, and lots of chilli. I don't know which part of Indonesia is this food from."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience on my second visit. I placed an order for 2 Alfredo's. When placing my order I asked for it without the tomatoes and spinach.  I said \"is that all that comes in it ? The tomatoes, spinach, and chicken?\" The employee replied \"yes.\" When the food came out there were mushrooms in it. My daughter asked for hers to be re made and I tried picked out the mushrooms. There were too many little pieces so I decided to ask for mine to be remade as well. I took my dish back upfront and said I tired to pick out the mushrooms but would like my dish remade. I made sure to be very clear say \"just pasta and chicken.\" After 15 minutes of waiting for my remake to come out I waited around up front until I finally got a girls attention. I'm not sure she if she was a manager but she was wearing a red shirt and had blonde hair. I told her I was still waiting for my remake. She replied \"I was told you didn't want it.\" I then asked for my money back since my party was done eating by then. She seemed annoyed and had an attitude. She asked somebody else to do my refund. Another employee comes over and does my refund. He was nice and pleasant but didn't ask why I wanted a refund. He then asked if I wanted the whole order refunded or just my dish. I'm not looking to get a free meal but I do think my whole meal should have been refunded for the inconvenience but again I'm not going to ask for it so I just said my dish. Nobody cares at all or even wanted to know what went wrong. Then he said he had to charge me the full amount but it will eventually refund my dish. I paid about $30 and got recharged $18 which doesn't make sense. So I'm still waiting while everything is pending to see if that clears up right. There was such a lack of customer service and made me feel like I was such a bother being there. Also I ordered two small fountain drinks and was given and charged for the bigger size. Definitely won't be returning. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for brunch and had an \"Okay\" experience.   The sign on their door said they open at 10:30am. We walked in at 10:50 and the crew in front said to hang out for a little bit because they do not open until 11am. So that's one star off.  The cashier was a young petite lady who spoke so soft, I could barely hear what she was saying and had to ask a couple of times to repeat what she said and for her to talk a little louder. She also did not put on any smile on her face so she looked like she was so tired of her job and was not very entertaining at all. Another star off.  I ordered the Pad Thai and it was an okay dish - it had more chicken and shrimp. What disappointed me most was the noodles were bland, plain and dry, as if there wasn't any pad thai sauce so I had to go back and ask the staff for the sauce. It was okay after that. Another star off.  My boyfriend got the Alfredo which tasted really good except that it was mostly veggies and meat not much noodles.  The place and ambiance was great and clean.   I think overall the restaurant has so much potential. I plan to check out their other dishes but probably not in the near future."}
{"text":"Very good, quick, filling meal. Their online ordering system it wonderful super easy to use, so that I get exactly what I want. The staff is also very pleasant."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try this place for years.  When they opened one up in Ahwatukee, I figured it was time.  It still took me months to get around to it.  I finally went the other night and, for once, I'm glad I dragged my feet on something.  The place is you typical clean, fast-casual spot with the twist that their menu features noodle and mac and cheese bowls.  You can build your own or go with one of their creations.  We went with the Korean beef noodles and the chili adobo bowls.  Both were wildly mediocre.  The serving sizes were quite large (for a small bowl) and perhaps their are items that stand out but these didn't.  It was about half-way through the meal when I realized I'd rather go to the place next door every time as the prices are comparable."}
{"text":"Not recommended at all. I've been here twice and tried two different dishes and both were absent of good flavor. The second time I visited my meal came with a little something extra included. As I reached the bottom of my bowl of pesto pasta I found plastic shrink wrap mixed in. Needless to say I did not finish the rest. It's just disappointing that I already finished 3/4 of the meal before I found my \"prize\". I for one will not be coming back. Take this review for what it's worth from the opinion of one guy. Like I always tell myself, give any place at least one chance to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food is always good. Prices can be a little high, but the amount of food you get makes up for it. Beer and wine prices aren't too bad either. No worse than a bar. Would definitely recommend it if youre looking for a quick place to eat that's a little more of a 'sit down' feel."}
{"text":"First time trying Noodles & Co. I must say they are decent tried. I tried the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese for the price there should've been more chicken. Variety of pasta dishes. I'd definitely try them again but something else."}
{"text":"I thought this place only specialized in Asian dishes.  I was surprised to see American fare on the menu as well.  I ordered a spicy vegetable dish with rice noodles that hit the spot.  This was actually my first time being inside a location.  The staff was absolutely great.  The young gentleman at the register was extremely personable, as was the young lady who actually took my order.  The restaurant was clean (as was the men's restroom), they were fully stocked, had everything we needed, and overall provided a positive experience.  I LOVE the fact that more restaurants are keeping us vegan folk in mind, and this one's no exception.  It's not as hard for vegetarians to find food options as it is for us extremists.  Lol.  I like this place--definitely going back."}
{"text":"Terrible parking but clean and really modern atmosphere. I love the counter ordering for noodles, lots of great options that can be customized. Quick service and love the coke freestyle machine."}
{"text":"Good was pretty good & the ambience is lovely, however, I would cook the noodles a tad bit longer."}
{"text":"Don't do it! First the gentleman handed me a dirty cup & when I handed it back he put it back on the stack of clean cups. Then when they delivered the food my soup almost got dropped in my hubby's lap. If you like real food you will be very disappointed. I'm pretty sure my soup was heated up in a microwave. I will give poor service a second shot if the food is good...... but I will NEVER eat here again! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that they offer like Chinese and Italian and German too. I know it's been Americanized but it's a small step away from the beaten path. Who doesn't love noodles? The fact you could take the family to this one restaurant and get something that appeals to you on that day. I may want pasta, but I don't necessarily want to eat Italian.  And if you've got a big appetite they've got a bigger bowl option. Let's not forget the gluten free thing. They have items that are automatically a gluten free combination and they have items that they can modify to make them GF with by eliminating maybe the croutons or switching out the type of pasta.   It's not just one or 2 items they have great menu with numerous options that aren't just a salad.  Their website appears to show that they \"recognize humane animal farming practices are critical to ensuring sustained food safety and high quality.\"  Clearly something that is important for us informed consumers.  Now if only they, and others like them, would steer clear of animals that routinely receive antibiotics.   But  *sodium conscious *500 calories or less *meatless *gluten free And entrees for those *watching sugar *vegetarian-meat and fish  Lots of positive things."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Affordable, kicks ass"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a higher review as I've eaten at other locations outside AZ and always enjoyed the food. For some reason, this location has gotten extremely stingy with the sauce on any of the dishes I've had. I've tried the Beef Stroganoff a few times, a each time the meat is good but only is thinly coated with sauce, leaving the noodles with nothing. Same with the Alfredo dish, only a hint of Alfredo sauce. It's as if they apply it with an eye dropper.   Next time (if there is one) I'll request extra sauce. Otherwise, I think I'm finished with this location. I've heard another location is supposed to be opening on the West side, hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"Never have had a good experience here. We have tried it 4-5 times but each time something is wrong or our order is messed up. The first time my noodles were so undercooked, they were had and chewy and you could see the portion of uncooked noodle. They always forget to put in the extras or to leave things out that you asked to be left out. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our first experience wasn't the best. We got food to go and basically our order was completely wrong. But the manager Elliott actually called us personally and emailed us 2 free meals. Upon coming back to claim our meals, he personally remembered us and was incredibly gracious and thankful we came back. The food is delicious when it's made right, and the management is great. Cool place"}
{"text":"Here and Panera are my go to places to pick up food on the way home. They've got great asian noodles and awesome salads. The soups are good too, and its easy to wait a couple minutes for food or order online to easily pick up. Big fan of the Penne Rosa, Greek Salad, and Japanese Pan noodles. I'm sure the american style dishes are delicious as well, but they always look overwhelmingly rich to me."}
{"text":"I love the Korean spicy noodles!. I ordered the small one which I regret because i wish i just get the regular one it was so delicioooouuuusss! I'm excited to try the other noodles next time :)"}
{"text":"Noodles & Co is worth going on any day.  This location has to do better. I permitted and dismissed a number of things but it's been months since the grand opening and the sauce portions are still the worst, they are slow as snails - I rate this based on my online order for a 7:45pm pick up and I get there and had to wait as they were just starting. Please note: I arrived at 7:48pm maybe 7:50pm.  My order? 4 orders of meatballs.   What I later learned while standing there it would have been cheaper to order it the way it's posted in the store and I would have received 6 meatballs per order not 5. Well, the website doesn't allow for that and I'll take that up with corporate.   All in all N&C is a midwest tradition and I hope it picks up around these parts since this is home now.   There are things that are not on the menu nowadays but the manager, Mr. Willie, is familiar with them so just ask for it to be made. Then you may rethink an $8 meatball sub with a side of soup just like i did after getting it. Made me ponder .... was I that rich or that crazy after school?"}
{"text":"I pushed my pickup order back by 1 hour but had to call it in since the we site didn't allow such changes.   The staff was IMPRESSIVE. I couldn't convey it while standing there because I'm so sick. Thought it was the flu since my body hurts.   Either way, the system showed the order wasn't paid for but I prepaid online and showed it.  I learned they're not allowed to touch your phone per corporate policy. I feel bad for them but understand.   At any rate, I hate the congestion in the area but I adore their service."}
{"text":"In all fairness the food had always been good. I've have various pasta dishes and my wife likes their salads. One constant is the Garlic bread which is always a treat.  Unfortunately another constant is a poor attitude by the servers. At the cash register and when the food is brought out. I believe in being courteous and when saying please or thank you, replies are snotty, snippy and condescending. Their facial expressions and body language speak volumes.  Of course attitude reflects leadership and that reflects on the business. It's hard to enjoy a nice meal when you feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"Well my pad Thai doesn't look half bad, but my mac and cheese is just some pre cooked macaroni that was microwaved with a stingy handful of cheese."}
{"text":"Love the variety of food offered with this place.  I always order online and it is always promptly ready when I arrive."}
{"text":"Noodles & Company fits in nicely with the not-quite-fast-food-but-only-slightly-better spots that run the show at lunch in the majority of Market Square. It's not necessarily cheap and the serving sizes won't likely fill you up, so the appeal isn't always there for me, but it's not a bad option if you're craving some pasta. I love the pesto cavatappi (add grilled chicken), but I've never eaten it and walked away full, regardless of the size that I've ordered. You could leave full if you opted for the mac & cheese with parmesan chicken or something, but you'll pay the price in calories (they do have a sub-500 calorie menu, but those options rarely fill anyone up).  There's also the issue with the awkwardness that's associated with online ordering. It's awesome that you can order ahead and pay online...but it's kind of weird how that results in a bunch of people just standing around in the middle of the restaurant waiting for their name to be called.  Generally speaking, everything has been decent. Pad Thai lacks flavor, but otherwise, everything has been okay. Nothing will blow you away, but if you're in a crunch and want some carbs, Noodles & Company is worth trying."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, full of wonderful healthy delicious food and wonderful workers(: An employee named Josh personally helped me turn a non vegan pesto dish into a mouth-watering vegan-friendly dish. Definitely a restaurant to return to and a suggestion for vegan/veggie consumers"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Food is cooked to order, so you receive a much fresher plate than the close by alternatives.  It is part of the malls food Court though, so generally noisy and surrounded by screaming kids!"}
{"text":"Quality noodles, delivered at a decent price. My beautiful companion had one penne rosa noodle in a bowl full of spirals which I was willing to look past because the server complimented my zebra shirt. I enjoyed the service. 110% better than spiralized zucchini noodles. Would eat again."}
{"text":"Everything was up-to-par with my expectations for your average chain \"fast casual\" restaurant, but sub-par in taste. My Japanese Pan Noodles were soaked in a greasy, sweet sauce that just made me feel bloated afterwards. Although it seems to be a healthier option, I'm extremely skeptical, as the taste of the food felt much heavier than what the calorie counts had listed on the menu. I suppose that's none of my business, but I thought I would warn the potential consumer.   Bottom line, better for you than Primanti's, obviously, but beware of what you order if you are trying to be healthy."}
{"text":"The Chinese chop salad had the perfect amount of dressing. It wasn't drowning in it but I could still taste it in every bite. They gave my daughter her spices on the side. All with great smiles and prompt service."}
{"text":"Blah, that pretty much says it all.  Mediocre at best.  There's just nothing to say about it.  I got the butter noodles.  Well, they were cooked right, not to much, not to little, but barely warm.  They weren't busy and the food came out in a reasonable time so why was it boarder line cold?  My husband had buffalo chicken Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese with chicken and than they doused it in some kind of nasty hot sauce ......over everything....not just chicken with buffalo sauce on it, but they drowned the whole bowl in it.  Yuck. It didn't even look good.  Oh, and it was barely warm, too."}
{"text":"I have been twice. I've tried the mac and cheese, the pad thai, and one of the spicy asian bowls. All were very BLAND. So bland, I wouldn't be able to distinguish their Thai from Italian blindly.  Also, there's not nearly enough parking. You will have to do a tight U-turn out of their little lot and find a spot in the street."}
{"text":"The noodles are great and the people are friendly. I had the steak stroganoff. The noodles and the steak were cooked perfectly. The atmosphere was relaxing. I took off a star for the floor being dirty everywhere. There were plenty of people standing around that were more than able to wipe down tables and sweep the floor. We'll be back again as the food is great and the service is good."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! I have been wanting to try Noodles & Company for almost over a year now and I finally did and I was impressed!   We ordered the large penne rosa for two of us and it was plenty, but we had also eaten a few hours before and just wanted something on the smaller side. But I was in the mood for penne ala vodka and this was the closest they had. It pretty much tasted the same. They put plenty of cheese on it also which I loooove. I could put cheese on every bite of my pasta and be completely satisfied!   The restaurant itself was very clean and inviting. They had a big open kitchen which was neat bc you could watch the chefs cook the pastas. They cook them in essentially a fryer with just water in it. Super efficient which makes for super fast ordering!! Definitely going to go back and try some more menu items. The Mac and cheese looked delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  It was the third time we were there, and all three times the thai green curry with shrimp was different.  Wish we knew what to expect."}
{"text":"Good diversity in their menu and super fast. Ordered the Chicken Veracruz and thought it was really good. A nice blend of ingredients. I would put the Alfredo Montamore as average to above average. Obviously the chicken is pre-cooked and you can kind of tell. The tomato basil bisque was great too and hit the spot on a colder day. A pretty good fast casual option, will be back."}
{"text":"I love Noodles & Company, this one was gross. No place to sit because there were dirty dishes on every table & a dirty soda station. I went to get forks out of the utensil holder by the soda station. I pulled out four forks, every single one had dried food on it. I went up to the counter & asked for two plastic forks & told the lady employee that I pulled four forks & that were all dirty. She said, \"Okay,\" no other response. Two stars because the food was actually good & hot. They really need to clean this place, it's disgusting."}
{"text":"Small portions, Large price.   I went in with low expectations and came out feeling affirmed.   I got the Bangkok Curry and it was just..okay.  The whole experience of the food was just...okay."}
{"text":"So zero stars isn't a possibility. Went there today. Lack luster doesn't even begin to describe our experience. Started at the counter. Told the girl it was our first time there.......she stared at me stone faced, no offer of help or what was good, just the blank stare. I began to worry the remnants of my earlier meal may be somewhere in my teeth or shirt she was staring so intently. So I ordered blindly. It's a noodle place, ordered Mac & cheese for myself and my daughter and Korean noodles for my son. Got the food to go, came home and unpacked what we had hoped would happily send us into a carb induced state of happiness......did I mention lack luster?!? The mac was not saucy. Needed salt and pepper and was overall just bland. Paid $1.50 extra for my serving of vegetable in the form of broccoli. There was maybe 4 flowerets in there. Even the Korean noodles were not tasty according to my 16 year old. Really disappointed! But, now I know! Will be leaving a message at corporate as well. We work too hard for our money to experience such dullness!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you are wanting something different.  It's a little pricey, but worth the cost for a change of pace."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back. Wasn't the worst thing ever. I went for lunch with coworkers and got the mac and cheese. I've definitely had better, but it's fast food. I actually had to ask for it to be warmed up because it cane out pretty cold and they threw a fit. Nonetheless, will not be giving it another try. I can make better mac and cheese at home."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after dropping some things off at Michaels. I ordered the Korean beef noodles. There was nothing i like about the food. There was less than one ounce of meat in my bowl it was so small you could barley taste the meat. The portion size was way to small zero value. The over all flavor was not good. There was very little flavor to the food. I will not eat here again. After leaving i felt sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"Wonderful as always. It's our go-to for a quick bite to eat. Your kids will like the Wisconsin Mac n Cheese. Mine do."}
{"text":"Time and time again I have been disappointed by the food at the Capitol Noodles location. Let me clarify that I've been to numerous other noodles locations and I've never had such subpar noodles as the ones I get at the Johnson location. Literally the only reason I keep going back is because of the coupons and its proximity to where I work.  I notice that the food is particularly low quality when I order for takeout, but even in store I usually order the pad Thai, which has extremely clumpy and stuck-together noodles, little (if any) sauce, and burnt eggs.  I've run into similar problems with other dishes as well.  Was the food unbearably bad? No. But would I go back there again? Also no."}
{"text":"this place is difficult to correctly categorize because of the various cuisines that are represented on their menu.  i always get the tofu pad thai though and find it completely satisfying.  the atmosphere is somewhere in between fast food and almost table service...i know that makes no sense.  just try it, it's a great location if you are on campus and it's always consistently good.  rather cheap too."}
{"text":"The Thai curry soup is great! (If you like basil)  The Bangkok curry bowl is a little bitter and too light on other flavors in my opinion.   I've had the Japanese udon noodles and found them to be just 'ok'.   I'll try more items but the upcharge for any protein is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Fresh noodles. All types of noodles. Receive perks when using your phone."}
{"text":"Like the Bangkok Curry with Tofu, the tomato soup, Pad Thai.  Good location and good quality food."}
{"text":"Noodles are probably one of my favorite foods to eat... probably cause they hang out and go well with pretty much anything:  sauce, protein, veggies...  just all around a team-player when it comes to a great bowl/plate of food.  I'm a fan of Noodles & Co... I know they are a \"chain\" but they still do their chain thing rather well.... especially when I just need a quick bowl of noodles for a long run in the morning... or just comfort food right before the sweatpants are slapped on and the couch calling my name...  They actually have more to offer than just noodles.  Aside from the many pasta dish/combinations... you can create your own noodle bowl, get some soup, choose a salad, have a sandwich - I think these guys also cater lunch meetings and whatnot.  The location at South Blvd is nice cause you can see it from the street.  Parking in the back can get tight since they share the lot with the wine place next door as well as the Five Guys.  There is also street parking on Magnolia Ave.  Staff is always super nice and tables are kept nice and clean (no need to clean up your dishes here).  They will make sure you get taken care of here."}
{"text":"Gross.  Went to Noodles for lunch on a Saturday, place was not busy.  Bathroom was disgusting.  Dirty floor and wet.  No paper towels.  Smelled.  Plates and bowls (all of them) were chipped.  Not sanitary."}
{"text":"Noodles and Company is a nice place to go if you're unsure what you want to eat. They have a great selection of options. And contrary to the title, you don't have to order noodles. There are a variety of different styles of dishes that are very distinct from one another. They also have great sandwiches, salads and soups. And they have a smaller and larger version of dishes depending upon how hungry you are. And they show you the nutritional information.   I like this location too. The staff is friendly, the location is clean and the food gets to you really quickly. The pasta dishes aren't on par with authentic Italian, pad thai is not on par with an authentic Thai restaurant and so on and so on. But the dishes are tasty in their own right and the prices are reasonable too.   Definitely a great option if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious food the first few times (when it opened)...then a noticeable decrease in quality while the prices kept rising. Now it's  more expensive to get less food....I'd suggest Red Oak or Eat Unique if you want healthy around here...otherwise, this place doesn't sustain the average college student."}
{"text":"We got the noodles to-go and a side and the side salad and side soup was not even half full. Was very disappointed with the quality and portion on this noodle & company. The tomato cucumber salad made me feel nauseous and had a weird displeasing aroma. I usually am a fan of Noodles & Company, but will not be going back."}
{"text":"After only being open for less than six months, this location in South Fayette has permanently closed. It was announced last week that Noodles and Company planned to close 55 of its 510 stores nationwide.  Also closed are the locations in Monroeville, Peters Township, Washington, and Wexford."}
{"text":"Wow, that was gross and the only thing \"fresh\" about my meal was the napkin to wipe that frozen veggie, barely saused, lump of slightly burnt noodles and Costco brand frozen meatballs.  I had heard good things about the noodle company and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Japanese pan noodle bowl with a side of Korean bulgogi meatballs. I swear the cook bought Costco frozen Italian meatballs and drown them in bulgogi sauce."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  They have a variety of different noodle dishes, including those that are Italian or Asian inspired.  Looked like they had some sandwiches and soups too but seemed like most people go for the noodles.  It's definitely not authentic Italian or Asian by any means, but it's good tasty food that has fresh ingredients.  They also try to be creative in some of their combinations--for example, I had the bbq and mac-n-cheese special that also had crispy onions on it and it was very tasty.  Good portions and reasonable prices.  You order up at a counter then they bring it to you, but the servers also come and check on your to see if you need anything and they were all really friendly and fast. Plenty of tables to sit at and was a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for their soft opening which was awesome because the food was all free. The place was pretty packed but the service was pretty darn impeccable considering how many people were inside. The place is very casual but very clean and nice and upscale.  I would definitely come back soon to try the pesto pasta dish. I had the steak stroganoff and it was awesome. We also tried the chicken noodle soup which is very good. You can tell the pasta is cooked perfectly and the sauces are really good.  Can't wait to come back with a normal crowd, I'm certain the service will be great as it was tonight already."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that Noodles and Company has made its way to AZ! Bowls are delicious and just how I remember. They also offer a lot of various flavors and lower calorie options. We went on a Sunday night and it was busy but service was very responsive and fast!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Noodles & Company to open for awhile now. I came today for the soft opening.   I ordered the Tuscan bowl with Parmesan chicken, cuz the Mac & Cheese bowls would have taken all my calories for the day... but I will be back for it!   It was absolutely stunning when brought out. In a clean over sized large bowl, paired with a house salad with Balsamic dressing.   The salad was served in a small bowl, and for 1.50 it was a nice portion.  Lettuce was fresh, tomatoes perfect, and not overwhelming amount of dressing.   My Tuscan bowl didn't get a picture taken b/c I was hungry and ate it... I am shamed!!   However, it was as good, if not better than it looked.   The restaurant itself was clean,  since it was the first day I would hope so.   The music was loud enough to hear but not where you need to yell to be heard.   I was served some desserts I got the Rice Krispie ball... it was banging!!   Only down fall was the drink machine had a line.   Staff was awesome and I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have become regulars here. The staff at this location are a step above the others we've visited. The food is delicious and we appreciate the sincere attention and service. Thank you Elliot and the rest of the team for a wonderful experiences time and time again."}
{"text":"Ok noodles. Dang it. I loved you so much.  7 years ago.  Maybe it was just a weird bowl of mac and cheese. But I'm older now and I need some REAL cheese in my Mac and cheese. Heck you can go across the street to the cows and milk them to make your own cheese if you want.  Service was quick though (and very nice) I will give you that and beyond the insane lunch rush and the HORRIBLE parking ( this isn't noodles fault it's just a bad parking lot for too many businesses in such a small area) I will most likely avoid this location during peak hours. I'll totally give it another shot and try the pesto. Mmm pesto."}
{"text":"I found this to be just okay. It was my first time in, my husband had tried the Tempe location a few times and we went on the recommendation of a friend who really loved this place. We shared the pesto pasta and added the parmesan crusted chicken. We also ordered three dumplings and the small order of meatballs. We found that the pesto lacked flavor and the chicken was over salty. The meatballs were nothing special and reminded me of the frozen kind you get for $5 a bag with a generic teriyaki sauce on them. The dumplings were probably the best thing we had and had the most flavor. Our friends ordered the alfredo and pad thai, I tried a bite of the pad thai with shrimp and found it to be sweet, a bit fishy, but otherwise no heat or real flavor. Our regular bowl and two small apps, plus one drink totaled just under $20. I was not impressed with this experience and would be hard pressed to return to try more."}
{"text":"I see a lot of myself in Noodles & Co. I don't mean that entirely as an insult, but I do mean it mostly as one.  Listen. I like to come off as classed up and aware and worldly and kind of hip. But you know what, you jackwagon? I'll shove some pork-laden, barbecue sauce slathered macaroni and cheese in my gaping yaw just like the next guy from Wisconsin.  Noodles & Co. and I, we talk all kinds of upscale talk, but we walk a portly trundle to the nearest Taco Bell. AND IT'S FINE. If you're a consistent patron of Noodles & Co. you are invested in the lie at this point as well. Sure, they HAVE healthy options. But you're getting the Parmesan crusted chicken cheese bonanza like eeeeeeeeveryone else, pal.  Have a 1000 calorie Indonesian Peanut Sauce monstrosity, fine. I will too. Hell, I'll have some for later as well. You know what? As I drive out of the Noodles & Co., I'll drive past the McDonald's and I'll sneer down my nose at it. \"Look at those hogs, knocking fries back like there's no tomorrow,\" I'll say as my face glistens with cheese and pork.  Eat at the Noodles and Co. Go on. Do it. Be \"worldly,\" and \"healthy,\" and wrong with me."}
{"text":"A familiar restaurant when the other local restaurants were extremely packed around 9PM on a Saturday night. Food was consistent to what we're familiar with.  We thought the layout was incredibly amazing and give it five stars mostly for this!"}
{"text":"I have always been faithful Noodles and company..yet you let me down today. We have been to several locations in Boston, Chicago and Indianapolis. However, when my husband and I received our bowls today.. the proprotions were drastically off! My husband's bowl of peanut saute had no sauce in it. What bothered me the most was that the chicken in my bowl was pink in the center. I was really disappointed today to say the least!"}
{"text":"Ive been to at least 4 Noodles and Co in Madison and this takes the winner as the worst location oft the bunch. As one of the previous reviews stated, this Noodles and Co is dirty.  I stopped in during  non peak  hours on a Thursday ( 2:30). There were about 5 people there total, however, a few tables remained uncleaned  for the entire time I dined inside which was about a good 30 minutes. They didn't seem understaffed and there wasn't a rush of customers. I am not sure why tables couldn't be cleaned during this time.   I order the large Steak Stroganoff as I always do.  My food was delivered to me fast, yet, was barely warm and my steak was a bit dry and overcooked. It was almost as if I got the  bottom  ends of the steak in the pot or however they keep the food until someone order it. My food wasn't good. I ate it because I was hungry and went without lunch for  the day.   Majority of the staff seems to be college students and younger so I am  not expecting the finest food in the world but even for a place like Noodles, I am not sure how you mess up a simple order to where its barely warm.   One last note, I noticed the dude who took my order hands were disgusting. Fingers nails were dirty. I hope he didn't cook my food. That should have  been my first sign to leave.   I am a believer in 2nd chances but I will skip out on this Noodles location in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant has more potential than execution. The first time I went I had a completely forgettable experience with their thai noodle bowl. I had legitimately forgotten this restaurant existed until the first crisp morning of fall I had a sudden craving for spaghetti and meatballs. I frantically search google maps for a nearby restaurant that could provide me with this and allow me to get back to my office quickly. I thought Noodles & Company was my solution.  I went at 11:00am and I was the only customer almost the entire visit. I quickly ordered my spaghetti and meatballs before I settled in to wait. I watched as a worker finally started to assemble my to go bag when the most bizarre thing happened. Instead of grabbing my spaghetti which was sitting on the counter, the only item left to complete my order, he stopped and went to greet the second customer of the day. I sat and watched the whole time he walked her through the menu and took her order while none of the other staff took a second to finish my bag. I honestly considered jumping past the counter to just grab my food and go. Wildly inefficient but he did apologize when he finally finished my bag.   The real problem is that when I got back to my desk my meatballs were heartbreakingly bland. There wasn't enough sauce for the spaghetti. The side salad was ridiculously small, even for a side. As much as I love the idea of a go to carb spot, especially as winter approaches, I doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"I have eaten there several times now in the past few months. Consistency has picked up, though I see the staff has changed again.   I feel comfortable eating there that i will receive a ok meal.  Noodles has changed their chicken again, to chicken breast, which is much tastier. (company wide)"}
{"text":"Oh how things have changed.   Before there is food, the lack of service is horrible. They don't care what you order as they can't remember what you order and when you get your order, there will be noodles in your food that you didn't order. AKA they didn't clean the dish.  The food has lost its taste which has nothing to do with just Madison. Of all the Noodles & Companies I have eaten at across the nation, they all have just become very chewy and bland.   The husk of what was the taste and experience of Noodles & Company is no longer.   Not worth the money or the time."}
{"text":"Fitchburg has always been good service. The challenge I have seen is the new staff is still learning the ropes. The staff is working hard to make sure 'consistency' is in their focus. If you are a foodie, local management is very much a excellent food, excellent service type. Many a time I have had the excellent experience of quality thought out food and service. Though they are working to create a consistent staff that is trained, they do a rather good job as they build up the staff.   Beyond the local. . .concerns.  Beyond the Noodles in Fitchburg and wider Madison, it seems the upper management of the \"brand\" of noodles is taking the company into a more 'fast food' approach. My concern is that food quality and customer service will suffer for all Noodles nationwide.    Remember, if you like noodles, you are the one that can make it great. speak back to the feedback on noodles. Speak you mind to what kind of food and dinning experience you want.   I love my noodles consistently and good staff. Smiles, good service and a of course EXCELLENT service.    ------ NDLS. Have you seen these gift cards? You know why? that is there STOCK Symbol. This unfortunately shows where their mindset is when giving a high quality experience. Upper management has changed over the years and now the response to my concerns are \"oh i am sorry you had a bad experience, we can get you a $20 gift card and you can try again\". I don't want their money, I want the company I use to know that was about customer service. 1. Food 2. Customer Service. It has been difficult to get a consistently good meal from the Noodles & company \"brand\" for sometime now. They are not training cooks to cook consistently. When they can't get mac-n-cheese to be done correctly something is seriously wrong."}
{"text":"I had the pesto and my guest had the mac and cheese. Both lacked tons of flavor. The noodles were barely coated with pesto or cheese (respectively), so you're basically tasting a bunch of bland noodles. The portion sizes are decent, but this food is not worth paying the prices for when they're skimping on the ingredients that contain the actual flavor. We each had a few bites, and decided to take it home where we could add more cheese and flavor to actually enjoy the food. Will not be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Ate at noodles and co in Denver often. Excellent mac and cheese. Prob some of the best I've had. Ask for extra cheese sauce and grated atop. Soooo good. Also the mushroom stroganoff. You can mix and match any meat in any Pasta."}
{"text":"The manager here is unbelievably rude, I was having a conversation and she felt the need to bud in and tell me to watch my mouth in 'her' restaurant. Definitely not her place to say anything to a customer and definitely laughable for her to call it her restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Ordered the buttered noodles with meatballs; it was pretty tasty with cracked black pepper and seasonings. Met my expectations. Wasn't wowed, but it was satisfying. Note: their ice tea was not good...very bitter. I prefer China Mist."}
{"text":"This place is amazing....grew up here and came back from going to school out of state. The service and the variety of options is still as great as it was when I left two years ago. One of the most friendly environments to be in. Clean location and recommend the Penne Rosa with parmesan crusted chicken all day...."}
{"text":"Good menu, but only serve try noodles. They used to serve them but not any more. I like a variety of different noodles that offer but they can be bit salty sometimes. Good menu for kids and adult. And very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Decent place for a quick bite but I found that it was way over priced for the quality of the food. It does move fast and the staff is friendly but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a \"fast\" food type pasta restaurant. I was excited when I saw this place was opening as I had been waiting for this type of restaurant to open since nothing but noodles had closed. The food was good but nothing spectacular for the cost. I had order a salad and butter noodles with chicken which end up costing me almost 18 dollars. Yes the portions are huge but for the price I could have gone to actual Italian restaurant and got same thing. I will try coming back but need to look into menu more if I am going to be spending that kinda money."}
{"text":"My friend brought me some Noodles & CO for dinner last night (good friend I know!)   I had the small Penne Rosa since I am a pasta fanatic. It was pretty good but obviously not the best Italian pasta dish Ive ever had. The penne was a tad too spicy and a bit overcooked. It did have a good flavor overall and the veggies were cooked nicely. I like that it's a non-frozen/fast food in a rush dinner option!    I think I may try some of the Asian noodles next time as she explained those are her favorite and from what Ive read that seems to be the consensus. I will definitely give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, we will be back. I ordered the Bangkok bowl and it had great flavor. Great mix of vegetables and the noodles were cooked just right. We didn't leave the meal feeling like it was too heavy. Would love to see a few more of these pop up around the valley."}
{"text":"Pad thai was pretty sad, looked and tasted bland. The egg was scrambled and thrown in as an afterthought and the shrimp were tiny. Hubby had the ramen which looked more appealing and tasted ok. Place seemed chaotic and there was always a line to get a drink. Was excited about a noodles restaurant but disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great and like that there were plenty of vegan options. The staff was friendly and efficient and the restaurant is very clean. Real dishes and glasses is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"Love the food and love this place. I have ordered almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all. I have lost about 15 pounds since I started eating here regularly. I go on average three times a week. I cannot understand how anyone can write a bad review about this place. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to see the sign go up for Noodles & Company several months back! I waited a couple of weeks until after their Grand Opening to try them out to let them get in their \"groove\" of having just opened and was really impressed! The service was amazing and a young lady met my girlfriend and I at the menu on the wall. She walked us through all the options of the menu being as it was our first time there.   I landed on the Alfredo Montamore and my girlfriend had the Spicy Korean Beef noodles. Great tasting alfredo sauce and the Parmesan crusted chicken was awesome. My girlfriend didn't believe her dish actually had ramen noodles in it, all she had ever had was the ones out of plastic that are like 10 for $2.00 when you are in college, these are 1000 times more tasty! I am not sure who ate more of which but, both were devoured in no time flat!! We will definitely be back however, next time I might come at lunch so I can enjoy my entree without an imposing fork reaching into my bowl!   Great location and a nice, warm atmosphere, definitely a step up from all the fast food places in the area (no cheap fluorescent lighting or plastic trays)   Glad to finally see some quality food in the area that doesn't come out of the deep fryer! Can't wait to to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Not authentic but has a great variety and is pretty good. Seating is limited and lunch rush is busy. Parking is kind of messy as well."}
{"text":"In the area on a cold Monday night and coming down with a cold myself I thought \"Hey, there's a noodle soup place near here isn't there?\" I figured I'd had Noodles & Co. bookmarked on Yelp long enough and decided to give them a serious try. In fact it was on a suggestion from a friend who frequented their location in Madison, WI.  So it was pretty dang close to closing when I stopped in but despite that they were most accommodating. (I'm usually on edge when I dare to go in a place so close to closing.) They complied happily though and even gave me a great recommendation to try out there current special the Thai Hot Pot. It was a cold buster indeed! Perfect amount of spicing and a great combination of ingredients that are standard to an Asian soup dish. Beansprouts, cuts of pork meat, perfectly boiled noodles and some slices of red peppers just to name a few of the ingredients.  After I finished that it was like a new world had opened up to me - I could breathe again through both nostrils! On the way out I couldn't help but noticing the huge rice crispy treats laid on top of the counter and of course I took a few home."}
{"text":"I ordered a small Japanese pan Noodle.. and the portion is very small! I mean very, maybe just 2 or 3 bite size. And the taste is just ...terrible. I ordered the Japanese Noodle part is because they said it's a little spicy. It is not spicy at all. There's no taste except a little bitter. The only thing that has a little flavor is the mushroom.. Plus for the price, I don't think I will ever come back again. Sorry."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting the noodles & company and I couldn't decide on what I wanted right away.. the lady that was helping my friend, was giving me suggestions when a gentleman came up and was trying to rush me into making my decision. I made my decision and he told me that I wouldn't like it so I changed my mind again. The gentleman had a very rude tone with me and was pretty much yelling at me. I said that I couldn't have mushrooms when trying to make my decision on what I wanted but received mushrooms in my meal anyways. Just an all around bad experience. I didn't even enjoy my meal after the rude customer service."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Staff weren't rude but weren't helpful or inviting either. My daughter got the Japanese Pan Noodles with steak, I tasted it and seemed overly salty, the steak was good. I had the mac-n-chz with the BBQ pork, the pork was good but there wasn't enough cheese to even cover the noodles and was doused in BBQ sauce I guess to make up for the lack of flavorless cheese.  For the price I feel like the serving size was on the small size, forks were hard to come by, and there was always a line to get a drink bc there is only one drink fountain. The black tea was good.  We will try this place again but I doubt it will be any better the next time based on other reviews."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices. I've been to the location on Univ avenue and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here around lunch time and didn't have to wait long to place my order. My friend ordered right after me and she ended up waiting about 15 mins after I got my noodles. I got the Japanese noodles and they were good. I wish they added just a little bit more sauce to it because the noodles were sticking to each other. The steak was good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here around dinner time on a week day. We ordered our food and sat down. We probably got our food within 5 mins or so. There is a lot of options for noodles and salads. They do have a few soups and appetizers. The cashier was very friendly and also gave us our food. He was also walking around the restaurant and was tidying up the place. He took our plates away and when we were leaving, he said bye to us. That guy deserves a medal!   We will definitely be coming back. Food was good. Chicken was delicious. Noodles were cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend. They were not busy at all. I was surprised. We ordered quickly and got our food at a good time. I got the pasta fresca. There was a lot of balsamic in it. I literally had 3 pieces of spinach in it. It was overall ok. My friend got the pad thai noodles. She wasn't crazy about it She said there wasn't enough sauce in it. Overall, the experience was ok."}
{"text":"Good for what it's good for. A quick bite to eat with lots of options for vegetarians. My daughter was a big fan of the mac & cheese. I was more so-so on the Indonesian Peanut Sauté. When I mentioned that the edamame was way over cooked (inedible) the response was \"That's too bad.\"  I do expect more action then sympathy at a restaurant when I indicate a problem. Sigh."}
{"text":"Let me start with what is good. The service was very friendly and it was efficient. Our food came out quickly and was quite tasty. There is a nice variety of options on the menu and they share the calorie counts so you can make an informed decision. My issue with the place is the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the dining area. Every available table that could accommodate our party of five was dirty - some with the last customers' dishes still on it and others with seating that had dried on crud on it that I did not want my children sitting in. The condiment area also needed attention. I'm going to hope that they were just off their game today and that this isn't the normal state of affairs around here."}
{"text":"I really think that this can be a fantastic place. The concept is ingenius! But, it seems to be as if they opened recently and I can see the shortcomings.    + Menu is awesome and so many varieties available: You can pick asian noodles, italian noodles, mac n cheese, etc + Giant Rice Krispie treats for dessert - Customer Service was lacking - Noodles did not taste fresh - Whether you order the Small or Regular, they only fill the bowls halfway (Straight from their mouths). I ordered a regular of the Japanese Udon noodles bowl expecting it to be filled with so many yummy vegetables. All I got was raw broccoli (smallest pieces ever), 3 pieces of carrots and a handful of bean sprouts. So if you are a vegetarian, don't have high expectations. - Dumplings were very dull in taste and you can tell they jist reheated frozen ones.   Overall, I do think this place has great potential, just needs to work out its menu kinks.   Pro tip: read the instructions on the back of the chopsticks. Hopefully it will make you laugh!"}
{"text":"Two and half stars is more appropriate. I don't know what it was about this location, maybe because it's still relatively new, but when I got takeout it seemed as if my pan noodles were drier than when I've ordered them at other locations. And the potstickers didn't have as much browning or char as I expected (making me question grill temp). Yeah, so either someone didn't give me the proper amount of sauce on my noodles or they've adjusted the recipes again to the detriment food. Gonna give it some time and come back at a later date, see if my minimum expectations for a Noodles locations can be met. Otherwise, inside it is a very nice looking place. So, there's that."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The food is pretty generic and the bowls have almost no vegetables. Microwaveable birds eye meals have more flavor. For the price and hype I expected so much more. I've been there twice and tried the pesto and the penne and was disappointed both times. We definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today with my mother for lunch. Our table had caked on food. The floor was covered in food and TP from the bathroom. The parmesan chicken was as thick as my knife handle and rubbery. Being a N&C fan this location is not on par with the he company's views. The east side need a better location than this."}
{"text":"Raw chicken salad isn't appealing. I just can't understand how the kitchen staff could cut up my raw chicken and put that in my salad. I ordered it on their website and had just a few minutes to pick it up and get back to my desk to eat during my 30 min lunch. I was blown away and really disappointed. They offered a free meal replacement in lieu of money back since I paid cash. I just have no desire to risk it after such negligence."}
{"text":"Noodles recently opened in South Hills Village Mall. I went with my two sons and we ordered a range of food and shared. We ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, Chicken Noodle Soup, Margherita Flatbread, a Steak sandwich, and a side salad.  The soup was a hit with all of us. Big noodles, great flavor, and is a great comfort food. The flatbread was tasty but lacked any crispness. The side salad was very good. I would definitely order it in a regular size. It was fresh and tasted great. The Spaghetti was also good. It was a big portion and we ended up taking some home. There were more meatballs than we expected and they were better than meatballs I've had at Italian restaurants. The sandwich had fresh bread and had a great ratio of steak, lettuce and cheese to bread.  One thing that makes them stand out in the food court is that they are the only place that sells beer and wine.  I will definitely be going back. They have salads and pastas that I would like to try."}
{"text":"Japanese Pan Noodles for the win! Absolutely delicious. So glad this place finally opened.  Love the chocolate chunk cookie after my meal. I'll be back for more very soon."}
{"text":"I love Noodles & Company no matter where it's located, but this one (State St. location) is my favorite. The building they are in is multi-level and you have the option to sit on the ground level or upstairs. I love the upstairs because you have a nice view of State St. Perfect if your a people watcher... in the non-perverted/creepy way, of course.  As for the food, I'm pretty much an addict. Most meals are reasonable calorie wise, with quite a few lower calorie/fat options available. I've never had something I didn't like there. While it's all very good, it's not hard to have a favorite. My current favorite is The Med Salad with grilled chicken. I would probably eat that every day if I could.  It also helps that Noodles is pretty easy on the wallet. While places like McDonald's are slightly cheaper, they certainly don't offer the all around quality that Noodles does."}
{"text":"I tried the Pesto Cavatappi with Chicken ($2.35 extra) at Noodles and Company.  Recommend it highly -- the curly pasta was well marinated in the pesto sauce, and the chicken was succulent!   The menu was well laid out, and the service was prompt! There is three different sections to choose from for the main entrees: American, Italian, and Mediterranean.  I very much enjoyed my meal, and look forward to trying some of the their other stuff (salads, etc.)."}
{"text":"Disappointed.    Thai curry tasted overly sweet... Like chimes ginger candy mixed with water and a sprinkle of curry powder.   Japanese pan noodles were dry -  broccoli, cilantro raw and dry.  Steak upgrade was anything but... Unless you're hoping for Salisbury.   Maybe I need to try the beef strognoff noodles everyone else was having."}
{"text":"Nice food and quick service. Reasonable price for some decent food. Great variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant. Service is quick, food tastes great and plenty of parking. The only issue Ive had is finding a seat during busy times."}
{"text":"Update, place is still a pig sty.Food  all over the floor right in front of me. Uncleaned ables all over, still a line of several people at the soda machine. Does anyone from Noodles read these reviews? If I had another close to home I would never return!!    Update from my visit the other day....change of review....This Noodles N Company was an absolute pig sty minus the pigs. Their was crap all over the floor (well rubbish/trash), the only open tables had plates from previous guests on them uncollected with spilled food all over the tables, seats and floor. In front of the fancy selectable Coke machine the floor was extremely wet, any wetter Noah would have needed his arc, the Coke machine which is supposed to give you 100s of options was well either broken or out of many flavours,I think there was a total of 4!!! drinks available, there were no napkins, the place was very noisy, the only thing that was messed up was the food."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's really cheap and good quality food. I always stop here on my way to the movies and they never disappoint. Friendly staff! Make sure to download their app, they're always giving away free sides on there!"}
{"text":"Our food wasn't the greatest.... Lacked flavor...(no seasonings) My ramen was sweet,hot and very little meat.... The other dish was plenty of beef yet still missing flavor!  Plus bought 2 meals to go and came away with only 1 set of flat wear!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I've had a serious crush on Noodles & Co. since my time at UW-Madison. It's always a solid, quick choice that leaves me full and happy.   The run down:  The employees: Chipper and happy, always service with a smile. They are also really happy to take to-go orders over the phone - and even more impressive, my order has never been anything than what I've requested (and I ask for a handful of substitutions).   The food: Fresh, hot and tasty albeit a bit expensive for what ya get. I usually go with the Japanese Pan Noodles. Delish.  The environment: It's definitely an eat & exit kinda place...you won't find super comfy chairs here!   Yay for Noodles...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was getting late and I had a race the next morning - needed something simple and quick - specifically of the carbohydrate variety.  I went with a pretty safe (read plain) option; penne noodles, tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, and sauteed mushrooms.  Points for fresh ingredients and efficient service but this is definitely not \"inventive\" food; this is a quick service restaurant chain - definitely not typical fast food, but not an upscale Italian restaurant.    I'll certainly eat at a Noodles and Company again (we go way back) but it is always when I'm looking for something quick, simple, and casual."}
{"text":"Was expecting ramen. Wanted ramen. No ramen. Had the peanut noodles, which could have used a thinner sauce to be able to slurp it up more easily.... and the pot stickers. Sauce was amazeballs."}
{"text":"Some co-workers wanted to go here for lunch, and I agreed, grudgingly.  I'd had it before when my company had a lunch catered, but I didn't find anything I liked then.  Today I tried the Japanese Pan Noodles with steak, and it is easily the best thing I've had from there before.  I've also tried the Pad Thai and the Steak Stroganoff, but I didn't care for those choices very much.   The noodles + a cookie (no drink) was $11.50, so I thought it was pretty pricey for an order of noodles that were average at best.  I rarely go on campus except when school's out.  I can see why the students would like it though since it's pretty fast.  I'd go again if others dragged me there, but I think there are a lot better options both on and off campus."}
{"text":"Food came out room temperature. The portion was very small and way over priced. Definitely nothing fresh about it. Tasted like it came out of a box that I could've thrown together at home for a few dollars. Gave it a total of 2 starts bc 1) it was edible and 2) the staff seemed friendly (not professional by any means, you could def tell they didn't want to be there, but they at least pretended to care about my experience to my face)... my daughter enjoyed her meal however I could have made it at home for much less. Definitely won't be returning here ever again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"This place has got it done right. The menu is simple: Noodle. Soup. Salad. And you pick from American, Asian, or Mediterranean fare.  They have a few choice favorites from each area and that is all. I loved this since I sometimes get overwhelmed by places with a million menu items. I still had some trouble picking what I wanted though, but it was only because there were so many good things on the menu!   In all honesty I came here with a hankerin for some pan-fried asian noodles, but then I saw they had Penne Rosa... and how could I pass that up?! I threw in a greek salad and I had the perfect take-out dinner. My only complaint was that I had wanted chicken with my pasta and they didn't ask me if I wanted to add any meat in... AND I forgot to ask for it. My bad? Their bad? A little bit of both.   Anyway, long story short, I will definitely be coming here again. I didn't have to wait long at all for my take-out and I left with plenty of delicious food for under $10."}
{"text":"Good lunch option if you're around upper State Street. While I can't give a spectacular rating for this place, I think it's hard to imagine that lunch here would go a completely disaster. I had Bangkok curry noodle while my friend ordered Japanese noodle - which was interesting cross between udon noodle and yakisoba. I guess that's one of the complaints I hear from other people about this place. They have their own interpretation of Asian noodles, so don't expect anything \"authentic.\"  Both of our dishes came out very quick from the kitchen. I was very satisfied with the portion, but my guy friend seemed  like he could have bit more on his plate. Nonetheless, both dishes were pretty tasty. I'm kinda curious to try the non-Asian dishes if I ever go there again."}
{"text":"The place is very nice, clean and hip. Employees are VERY friendly and helpful. I am giving it a two star simply because I ordered the steak stroganoff and it only came with three small pieces of steak. I got take out and since it was my lunch I got a small bowl. Wow, it tasted great but I think I would have been better off just ordering buttered noodles. I was still hungry and VERY disappointed that I couldn't get enough protein to hold me over till dinner. My normal lunch is a half of a sandwich from Sprout's. I get way more for my $3.49 then I did at this place. Increase the amount of protein! You come across stingy and cheap. If you do this people will come back. People want to feel that they got what they paid for. NO WAY this time!!! Good luck! Hope you read your reviews and make changes because it those that write the reviews that care. Make the changes to make us happy and you should be successful."}
{"text":"First time trying noodles and co. I must say I'm pretty happy. I had the Korean beef and the Thai soup. Very happy with my entree. She asked if regular size was ok and I said yes and that I wasn't sure what size that was because I've never been there before. No description of size but I bought some home. Soup was ok but not something I'd get again. Vegetables were under cooked like they were just cut and thrown in the broth, which did have a nice flavor. The beef dish had good flavor and just enough spice. Beef was tender. Will probably try again."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this Noodle & Company since I moved to Charlotte in August of 2015, my go to meal is the Japanese Pan Noodles with Shrimp. I've also had the spaghetti and meatballs, the mac & cheese and the penne la rosa which are all very good. I'm looking forward to trying more dishes in the future.   I have tried several other locations but this one is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Ever since my college days, I've been a huge supporter of Noodles and their diverse culinary options. I really think they do an outstanding job creating quality, affordable dishes despite being a fast food chain.  This location had very quick service. I ordered the Bangkok curry and was thankful to have crisp, whole vegetables in my dish. They certainly have a range of options to meet any diet and their calorie counts are on their menu. They also serve beer and wine, which I think gives it an edge over other fast service joints."}
{"text":"The noodles and pasta here never disappoint. I have been here two times and both times there, the service was impeccable and the food was like homemade and cozy. The pad Thai is always a safe and yummy option for all people. but all of the choices on the menu are wonderfully delicious as well."}
{"text":"The noodles were average.  Its not as good as I remember it from my college days, but it was ok for lunch."}
{"text":"They always forget items on pick up orders and they act like you're lying about it on return call. Portions are random, sometimes you get a ton other times hardly anything.   UPDATE: this place is absolutely gross. they throw your soup around, i've found HAIR almost every time in my meal. guest relations does not care will not return you're email.  like i said, simply, GROSS"}
{"text":"Have eaten at Noodles and Co. In the mid west and California for years. I was very disappointed to see they changed the full juicy sliced chicken breast to dried out gross chicken medallions. The Bangkok Curry now resembles a Lean Cusine and I am unwilling to shell out nearly $9 for it."}
{"text":"I was looking for something to eat on my last day in the City, and after taking a long walk around, I settled on Noodles & Co.  I looked at their menu and decided on the Mac & Cheese with BBQ pork  no fried Jalapenos.   It was delivered to the table in a few minutes and I honestly devoured the whole thing, which is unusual for me.  Every ounce was delectable. The meat was tender, the mac & cheese was flavourful and just right. I was really impressed.  I -WISH- we had this franchise in Florida. I would visit frequently.   For the $8.00 I spent I got a hefty helping ( and I ordered the small). The food was served at a great temperature and all in all I was truly happy with what I got. Way to go! You've got a Floridian fan!"}
{"text":"Simple, Fast concept that tastes great. If you need your carb fix, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The only thing I have ever ordered is the Pesto Cavatappi with the addition of the chicken! I can't get enough of this stuff. It is amazing. I love that their pasta is a perfect al dente and the pesto sauce is perfect, not an overpowering pesto at all. Chicken is always tender and compliments the pasta perfectly. This location is located in the mall itself so obviously there is plenty of parking. They also have their own seating area located in the food court area if you are a total Noodles snob! lol 15% military/first responder discount"}
{"text":"Used to love Noodles and Company but this location continues to underwhelm.  Burnt Parmesan chicken and terrible noodles.  They've become an overpriced McDonalds with the low quality food."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick and nutritious lunch compared to the rest of the restaurants in wexford. Fast food speed with sit down quality. How could you ask for more? PS try the curry with shrimp it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for there spicykoean noodle was nasty sweetness does not go with noodles and call it Korea just didn't taste right Mac and cheese tasted decent but not the best crew was friendly I think that was the only good thing about the restaurant"}
{"text":"This Noodles restaurant tends to be pretty busy anytime I've been in to pick up food or to dine. I like their online ahead option. Your food is all ready for you to pick up and you get to skip the sometimes long line. The restaurant can get dirty at times, including the restrooms. When you have lots of kid diners in one place, things get messy (give it a 2 stars). The food has been pretty consistent with each order (give it 4 stars). I like that I can order an entree and know exactly what I'm getting. Sometimes in high traffic times, the food will take a little longer to arrive at the table. They allow substitutions on orders, which is great for those that have food allergies or have particular food preferences. The parking lot outside tends to get pretty busy and I have seen a couple of near miss accidents. I tend to park on the adjacent road and then walk in. They have a nice patio area. Unfortunately, it is located overlooking busy PD and the aggressive drivers on the road. I have had noodle dishes, salads and sandwiches from here. I would give most of the food a 3 or 4 stars. The affordable price and offerings are great for families. Most people can find a meal that would satisfy the palate."}
{"text":"They do not have the ability to give you decent portion sizes. I don't pay full price for a regular to get the equivalent of what a kid's meal would be. I would easily go to any other Noodles over this one at this point, as Tempe Noodles has always been great and has NEVER been stingy. This place is way too stingy for the prices. And why is it only this Noodles & Company?? They also have an issue with taking pick up orders at the pick up order register. Every time I come to pick up an order, they either have someone actually placing an order at the pick up register or they ask you to go to one of the other registers. What's the point of designating a pick up register if you don't use it for that ever? But mainly... The portions.... I mean. Come on. Picture included to show how ridiculously stingy they are."}
{"text":"This place is the best place ever. I live 15-20 minutes away from this location but I literally will not be stopped. Every time I order to go here, they always make my noodles perfectly. No matter what kind I order. I'm so glad I tried them again after I originally tried Noodles in Colorado."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot, especially the Japanese noodles, but I love the staff.  Every single time I've gone in there, we've always gotten great service.  All Noodles & Company do well by me, but this is my favorite location."}
{"text":"Crazy busy at lunch time!!! Truffle mac and stroganoff are their best dishes."}
{"text":"Got the pad thai from here and it didn't taste anything like it. It was just plain noodles with a hint of sweetness and large pieces of scrambled eggs. Don't get it."}
{"text":"We placed a pickup order here and it was my first time. The online ordering was convenient and picking up was easy. You can place your order for ASAP or schedule a pickup time, it was pretty easy on the computer and on my phone. When you go to pick it up there is a convenient area you walk to and grab your order. You don't even have to talk to anyone.   I got the Wisconsin mac and cheese with the Parmesan chicken on the side with a side of the Thai chicken soup. It was fine. It wasn't anything special at the end of the day but it filled me up. To me, it was so-so there were no bold tastes or anything extravagant.   I would be interested to try another type of pasta from here but if it rated the same, probably wouldn't be back.   Interested to give it another shot in the future and will update my review then."}
{"text":"Came with a friend because she'd heard a lot about noodles&co from her roommate and wanted to try it out during her visit. (Apparently we don't have this on the West coast?)  At 6PM on a Thursday, the restaurant looked like a kiddie park. Seriously. There were toddlers everywhere. Under tables. On top of tables. Wailing. Throwing food. Yikes. Next time I'm getting take out.   Anyway, I was craving some pad thai, so while I was slightly skeptical about the Asian dishes at Noodles&Co, I decided to give it a try.  Five bucks and change for a bowl of pad thai was a pretty good deal!...but $2.95 for shrimp add-on?? smh.   Sad to say that Noodle&Co's pad thai tasted better than some pad thais that I've had at \"authentic\" Thai restaurants.  The noodles were slightly undercooked and I had to use up a whole lemon's worth of lemon wedges from the beverage station to really get a nice kick of flavor, but at least now I know where I'll be getting my pad thai fix...when I'm desperate."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Most of their dishes have mushrooms, which I hate. The limited options that I do like are pretty good."}
{"text":"Always pleased with this place...the suggestions of meat to add to the noodle bowls are perfect! it's inexpensive and I'm definitely full by the time I leave. Casual atmosphere, although the customer service at the register could use a little help. Overall, good experience, though."}
{"text":"I love noodles! The girl who took my order was great. She really knows the menu. As a vegetarian with a husband who is allergic to dairy, it is nice to be treated respectfully and have people who know what's in the food at restaurants. She definitely knew what was in the food. The food was super yummy and quick. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Noodles and company simply disappoints when comparing what you paid for with the amount of food received. Relative to nearby restaurants, it's more so expensive. For quality of food, the Asian dishes are bland while lacking in vegetables. The penne rosa with chicken is really the only thing worth getting here. Wait times are normal. The ambience is very disconcerting. Music is blasting in your ears when you're simply trying to enjoy your meal. Mercy please. Overall, I rarely visit unless I, for some odd reason, feel like overpaying for craving penne rosa."}
{"text":"$5.75 for the Thai soup this size, holding it in my average sized hand for reference  It's a great convenient location and the soup was delicious, the size and price is a little outrageous. Will probably go again but not order the soup!"}
{"text":"This isn't my go to place-- I only visit when I have a coupon.   The Asian-themed choices are not so great. It's a good attempt without have an expensive. price (for a college campus). For example, with the Thai curry and the pad Thai, it's the right general direction for the flavor, but it just misses its mark. For more authentic Thai dishes, I would go someplace else.   However, I still prefer the Asian noodle dishes over the Italian and other choices-- so if I did somehow decide to like Italian in the future, my opinion of this place might change after trying the other items.   There are a lot of options, so I would take some time reading the menu that they have hanging on the right side of the line to the cashier. The menu behind the cashier doesn't have the same descriptions. Many items don't include meat, by the way-- it's an extra $2.50+. So if you do want a meal with meat in it, it comes out to ~$10+  The menu appears to be organized in a certain way that I really don't understand. The first impression is that it's sorted by price, however some items have different prices listed under them. (You'll notice what I mean when you're right in front of it.)  The workers have always been super friendly, and it's regularly filled with students, so I'm guessing they're doing something right.   P.S. Sign up for their email list for BOGO free coupons."}
{"text":"Been here twice! Not bad for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Ever since they put a noodles in Tempe I've never been more excited. I've recently downloaded the app and have been receiving some awesome rewards. I wanted to share some love to the amazing staff at this location, they always make me crack up and I'm always leaving with a smile and happy tummy :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food but I asked to see the size of the small bowl before I ordered, decided to go with the small. When I got my food the bowl wasn't even halfway full, my 3 year old had at least twice as much pasta in his kids meal than I had  I was a bit disappointed with that. And there were only 2 meatballs and a splash of marinara sauce. I gave two stars because what I got was good, I just wish there was more of it and the place was clean."}
{"text":"If you like your noodles al dente this is the place for you. I wasn't too impressed with my pasta dish."}
{"text":"I've passed this place every morning for the last few weeks and have been meaning totry it.  I was very disappointed with the portion size.  I bought the small stroganoff for $8.99.  And trust me they mean small.  The noodles, beef and mushrooms were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.   I would have liked a bit more sauce though.  By the time I got back to my office I found it to be a bit dry.Will need to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Pad Thai was close to what I'm used to getting at other Thai restaurants.  The potstickers had a great flavor and texture to them and the soy ginger dressing for the salad hit the spot.  This is a place we'll be back to with the kids, especially our noodle eater."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are craving noodles! It is very straightforward. You order from the menu, which has even calories listed, and the server will bring it to your table. It is inexpensive and the portions are good. They also have some baked goods and serve wine as well! The location is conveniently located with plenty of parking spots, it is clean and modern and has a nice ambiance. I will def. return if I have noodles on my mind. It is quick, easy and inexpensive. The staff is super friendly and are happy to assist you if it is your first time (as it was in my case). Unfortunately, I do not remember the super nice gentleman´s name who served our food, but he was kidding around with my daughter and paid attention to her and made us laugh. This experience made us want to come back because he was very sweet. The next time I will return, I will make sure to get his name and update my post accordingly.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Never sure what to write about this place. I like the food, but services and cleanliness are so lacking unless you say something about it. Totally empty now but half the tables not cleared. Salad came out only after I mentioned it to them."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I can never decide on what I want when I walk in the door because there are always 3 or 4 dishes that I find appealing.  While it can get a little crowded at lunch time, it's worth the short wait for an open table and it simply shows what a great restaurant it is.  Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened in my area and every time I come here I'm disappointed. I don't understand how a restaurant can serve so many different dishes that are so bland - as I type this I am eating a \"thai sweet chili chilled noodle salad\" that tastes more like water than Figi does. I'm tired of paying such high prices for food that truly tastes like nothing at all. The warm dishes never have sauce on them, to the point where the noodles are so dry that they get all bunched up and crusty."}
{"text":"I ordered to go.  I ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a macaroni and cheese with broccoli.  The service was average and the order was accurate.  Unfortunately, when I came home, the soup was not secured properly and the broth had dumped into the outer plastic bag.  The plastic bag was not very strong so I wasn't able to take a picture and wanted to salvage what I could ASAP.  I was able to save about half the broth and the majority of the chicken and noodles, but was no longer left with \"soup.\"  Had the soup not spilled into the plastic bag, this would have been a 4+ star experience."}
{"text":"Noodles...what could possibly go wrong at noodles? Well first they need more staff (roommate worked here for three months) and a better way to order without people standing outside or with the door open.  Waited in line 25 minutes; yes it was trick or treat on State St. night but then maybe have on call staff to call in to help out. This time we left and went elsewhere.  But another visit wasn't so busy. We ordered beef stroganoff and some kind of pesto chicken penne and a couple of beers.  The beef from the stroganoff was really gristly and chewy had to put it in my napkin... Couldn't get it down.  The chicken pesto penne was great! As was the beer.   But don't think Noodles is going to be a regular spot for us since I'm Italian and can make really good homemade pasta cheaper and tastier at home.   It's a cute place to go eat if your younger maybe and don't enjoy cooking at home or just enjoy any pasta/noodles.  There are lots and lots of choices... And beer, wine, and soft drinks. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while and persuaded my friend to try it with me. I got the Japanese Pan Noodles (I added steak to the dish-- I definitely recommend if you want some meat, very delicious) which was a tad salty but bursting with flavor with a hint of spice! I was told they put a little extra sauce on my noodles which is probably why it was a little more salty that I would like, but that's alright.   The chicken potstickers were good as well. The dipping sauce was delicious and tasted like my noodle sauce. The dough looked as if it was boiled and then pan fried but it did feel like I was eating raw wontons wrappers. Not sure if I'd order those again.   The guy who took our order was beyond friendly and helpful... he even came to our table to see how everything was! Now that rarely happens to me at a restaurant that I pay at the register first, unless it's a mom and pop place, so I was delighted!   The reason for the four stars was due to walking into the restaurant and being hit was a slight odor that wasn't pleasant but after 5-10 minutes I didn't notice it."}
{"text":"Super friendly and quick service. Nice place to pop into for a quick bite, or to sit down and enjoy a nice meal. Their portions are excellently priced and placed. Smalls are a good lunch, while the large is a HUGE dinner. I got the Alfredo and it was amazing. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We tried the new korean dish, Wisconsin mac and cheese  (we wouldn't recommend getting it with meatballs, they werent very good), and the beef stroganoff. All were delicious!! However some dishes seemed overpriced for what they were but delicious nontheless. We got a snickerdoodle cookie to end the meal, best snickerdoodle I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I liked my meal, it was better much than I was expecting. Had I read these reviews I would probably not gone and missed out on a good meal, clean, polite customer service. I had the Med Salad which I would order again."}
{"text":"This is our first time and we ordered Spicy Chicken Caesar and BBQ Pork with Tomato Basil Bisque soups, it was delicious and not overly priced. They even serve wines and beers, yummy."}
{"text":"I'm a noodle-lover. Not only is the food here delicous, but the customer service is also really good. I highly recommend to choose this place for lunch."}
{"text":"This place offers a diverse variety of different noodle and pasta meals. The food was just ok. The portions were small for the price. With so many food places in the area, I wouldn't come back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"What's to say? It's a noodles. Good, consistent pasta, pretty outdoor patio. And I would want nothing less."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. But it always feels a bit sticky and dingy. It seems there is always a single fly buzzing around every time I visit. Strangely Proustean."}
{"text":"Noodles in general is awesome and a five star in my book. THIS particular Noodles location...not so much. The last three times I've been here it has taken forever to place my order (lots of staff milling around, but only one at the counter), the person taking the order is generally a snotty high schooler with zero customer service skills who seems irritated that I want to give her money, and my food order has been wrong. In one instance, upon returning to the counter to get my order fixed, I was asked to wait there while they fixed the order."}
{"text":"The dish I tried here was not that good. I ordered the korean beef noodles. Not sure what the korean flavor was that they were referring to. I tasted some soy, sugar, ginger, and vinegar. The beef was cut into tiny strips, which serves to dry out the meat quickly. Beef was tough and bland. The noodles used were basically instant ramen noodles. Not really happy with this noodle dish. Maybe if I try spaghetti with meatballs here it'll be better. For close to $10 for a small bowl of noodles I'd recommend skipping it."}
{"text":"This place has gone from bad to worse. Now besides the overcooked noodles, you have to contend with flies buzzing around and landing in your food. And, the manager tells me they're fruit flies. I'm so glad to know he knows what they are, now why don't they get rid of them. I was told they're coming from outside! [Insert eye roll and head shaking here.] None of the other restaurants in Market Square have fruit flies. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Great surprise to see them here, ate at one in MN. Wonderful place to have dinner w/ the family or a quick stop in for lunch. There's really something for everyone including the kiddos. I had the spicy Korean beef noodles and potstickers. You can customize your bowls w/ veggies you want or don't. My bowl does have a spicy kick that coats my whole mouth which I love. There's a very fresh undertone, you can tell there are fresh ingredients being used in the kitchen. The potstickers are tasty and cooked right, slightly crispy but still tender on the inside. Serves is speedy and friendly. I asked several questions for my celiac and glutton intolerant buddies and the employee was very knowledgable. Good news peeps, you have many options including a yummy looking Pad Thai. This is silly but I'm obsessed w/ the new soda machines that have a hundred options. I had diet orange ginger ale, who knew?? Great paring for the spice of the beef. The one desire, at least one ramen w/ a beef broth. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This review isn't for the food, location or atmosphere. It is for a skilled manager who knows how to treat customers.  Both of our orders, with slight customizations, were delivered in error. We could tell the guy at the register was newer so we gave him a break and I picked out the mushrooms. Gross!  A manager was passing through, busily clearing and cleaning due to a surprising rush of people. She briefly asked how our meal was and we responded that it was good but there were mistakes in both. Without any question, she disappeared into the back to our confusion, only to return with two free meal vouchers and an apology.  Customer service is still alive in some places and with some people. Refreshing. We will return."}
{"text":"Fast food noodles/pasta.  The chipotle/Boston market of noodles.   They have different kinds such as pad thai, beef stroganoff, penne, alfredo, or make your own custom dish.  It's not amazing but not bad either."}
{"text":"I seriously do not understand why they have just three stars.  I would say that since they have been open for awhile now and have worked out the initial kinks, they are 4.5 stars.  Since Yelp doesn't offer half stars, I round up in fairness to the business and employees.  They would be a perfect five if there was more consistency between cooks.  I order they same thing nearly every time I go (Indonesian Peanut Sauté) and although it looks the same all the time, it does not always taste the same.  Sometimes the spice is a bit too hot and the flavors are muted.  I have actually ordered it for lunch and dinner on the same day and had two completely different tasting bowls.  I have never received bad customer service in ten plus visits regardless of the time of day I dine.  Additionally, their kids meals are a bargain at 5 bucks.  Yes, it's not the cheapest kids meal around, but it's definitely one of the healthier ones with natural ingredients.  My four year old son said their macaroni and cheese is the bestest in the whole world.  My only suggestion would be to install more booths in the dining area.  Give them a try... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Customer service friendly store clean service fast. Portion in bowl was terrible. Barely thin layer to cover bowl bottom (was a small) and small drink just ordered butter noodlesand it was almost nine dollars! For that amount i could ave gone to sarku next door and got noodles with chicken teriyaki and veggies AND a medium drink! Shame on you noodles and company. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Beware customer service is horrible here . Ive been coming to this noodles for years - just had the worst customer service experience of my life. My buffalo Mac and cheese order was incorrect and the staff argued that it was correct. Seriously does the owner know these people are pulling this crap on their customers. I'm going to another franchise from now on !"}
{"text":"I've generally only reserved visits to noodles when I am in a rush and have no left overs for lunch.  It is close to work, and can be a good place to people watch...it gets quite crazy at lunch time.  This time, I came in a bit late, 12:30, and it was packed with a big lunch crowd, folks waiting for orders...TONS of kids running around...which is fine, free entertainment....so I expected to wait... a bit.  Not 1/2 hour!  The line moved quickly enough...I ordered a small Japanese Noodles with Chicken and a drink.  Found a small open table in the corner and started to surf the internet while waiting for food....after 15 minutes, I realized my food still wasn't there, the place was clearing out...and the annoying bass from the speaker above my head was causing my heart to palpate...so I switched locations....  Waited another 15 minutes...nothing....noticed people around me were getting food and they had arrived AFTER me.  When I asked at the front, the woman was quite frustrated and explained she had no idea where my order was and couldn't tell me, the computers were broken...  I went back to my table and did finally receive my food after that...meh...for nearly $10?  really?  no, sorry.  I can do a lot better elsewhere...."}
{"text":"I thought this was a soup place. I was wrong. There's plenty of other noodle items such as pasta and pad thai. I had myself some beef stroganof. It was pretty good and the large bowl was enough to get me full and take some home for a future meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Quick service. Has several choices for gluten free pasta. Place is a bit pricier then I would have liked ($12 for my small pasta bowl w/extra chicken) but the food is delicious. Do yourself a favor and try the grilled Parmesan chicken on your bowl. You will be glad you did!!!"}
{"text":"Ay this place is the most genius idea. Every kind of pasta dish from any country imaginable. And if it's not on the menu you can ask for it customized. The penne rosa is amazing! Very caloric but like its pasta so it's whatever. Their rice crispy treats are delicious!"}
{"text":"Coming here I see a lot of people waiting in line which oddly enough is a good sign. Food must be good!   I ordered the Japanese Pan Noodles, Large size, when I got it I was kind of confused weather or not they gave me a Large size? The bowl was definetly Large, but the portion was a Reg for sure.. It was literally a huge bowl with less than half the portion to fill it? I feel like I paid for the bowl haha..  Now the food was great, I enjoyed the taste of it.. Wish there was more hence why I bought the Large, as good as the food was, $10 for a drink and 5 bites of noodles with 3 pieces of broccoli is just not worth it. Kind of bummed and still hungry, should have gone across the street to chipotle :("}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get. I work in the mall, so it's very convenient to eat here, and pretty quick too. The staff are very competent and polite. However,  it's about 10 dollars for a regular sized bowl of noodles with no additions. If you do decide to add chicken, it is very very obviously frozen and tasteless. The texture is plasticy. I ususally get the steak stroganoff, which is hit or miss. I really love it about half the time, and the other half it tastes bland. They do have Sriracha sauce out and available, which is nice.   I've been trying to eat healthy lately and there isn't much of a selection in the food court, so I got a chicken ceasar salad. It was over 10 dollars, and was very disappointing. It was almost entirely large clumps of lettuce, and had a few pieces of the previously mentioned chicken. The dressing was okay."}
{"text":"Always disappointed with this Noodles and Co! I simply ordered a soup with a side ceasar salad and I got a balsamic vinaigrette mixed salad. Also the only reason I came here is because Panera was closed so I will be going back to Panera next time it is open!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Noodles & Company location I have visited. After being talked to in an extremely rude manner by the cashier for asking for a to-go cup even though I was eating in the restaurant, I found that the Coke Freestyle machine was out of lemonade. I asked staff if they could refill it, and without even looking, the employee said \"Yeah, I think we're out\". This was also after I was up-charged for a large drink because they were out of medium cups.  Treat your customers with kindness, or don't work around people."}
{"text":"Don't go out of your way to eat here. We tried it because we keep passing it in our way to a movie. I ordered a regular size spaghetti and meatball while my gf ordered the small steak stroganoff and I swear that my regular spaghetti could have fit inside the small size. Disappointed. The food was also a bit cold and dry looking. The garlic bread made up for the portion size somewhat.  Also the tables around us were dirty, had trash and dishes were on the table from before we sat down until past when we left. Plenty of employees and no one wanted to clean apparently."}
{"text":"Very good comfort food, I love the atmosphere & employees. It's small though and can be tight to get through other tables. There's a Coca Cola remix machine (I think that's what it's called) which is cool but there's only 1 so a line does form quickly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick weekday lunch. It was pretty busy around noon so expect a line up and a bit of a wait for the food. We chose to sit in the self seating dining area and found a seat fairly quickly. We were in and out in under 45min so it wasn't too bad.   I had the Bangkok noodles with the gluten free noodle option. Husband had the peanut noodles. Both were delish. I would definitely go back to try more. The serving size is more than adequate.   They also have some interesting breakfast options which I will also be trying soon as they are on my way to work."}
{"text":"I enjoy Noodles and Company in my home town and felt safe getting dinner here one night during a business trip.  I decided to go because I had gotten an email that it was free Mac and Cheese night.  Order any reg entree and get a free order of Mac and Cheese.... Whats not to love?   I went there around 7 pm on a Thursday night.  I found it hard to find with all the construction of the new light rail.  All the businesses are down in a lower part of the street so I had to do some searching to find it.  I did get a regular order of the stroganoff and of course my free Mac and cheese.  I sat waiting for my to go order to come up and then a manager came out and told me that they had run out of elbow noodles for the Mac and Cheese!  Would it be okay if they made it with another noodle? I was fine with that... Pasta is pasta to me.  He apologized and offered me a free cookie or soda to make up for the challenge.  I said it was fine and there was no need for compensation.  A few min later my order came out and I was on my way.   I do enjoy Noodles and Company but I have to say that whenever I try anything there, it always has a 'different' taste.  Not sure what it is but it just is off... Oh well...   I am sure I will make one more trip back before I leave Charlotte!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I tried this place again and still feel the same.  I went at lunch and it wasn't busy at all.  Service was friendly, but I had to wait awhile for my dish long after my friend's came out.    I got the penne rosa with egg noodles.  The spinach and mushrooms were pretty much uncooked which wasn't so great. I ate the noodles and that's all.  Sauce was ehhhh.....tomatoes were pale and uninviting.    I still prefer Nothing But Noodles."}
{"text":"Not bad but not good either. I've tried this place several times looking for something. They're known for their noodles but I haven't found a noodle dish I liked. I tend to stick to their soups. The pastas I've tried were bland. I had high hopes for this place and then I discovered they didn't have Alfredo sauce. What pasta place doesn't have Alfredo? I like their tomato basil bisque and their chicken noodle soup. And they have a coke remix machine. Any place that has a remix machine automatically gets a star in my book. The customer service is always friendly though. I'm still going back for soups and salads."}
{"text":"Great food and portion sizes, they recently raised their prices which is a bummer because it is pretty prices for noodles; however, I am a fan on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Today, I got the Bangkok Curry with Chicken. I can't really tell if it tasted different than the Indonesian Saute. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it tasted like many peanut sauce dishes. The chicken was cut up and cubed, there wasn't much of it, but it was ok. The sauce and veggies were delicious so it made up for the mediocre chicken. I like coming here mostly because of the soda machine. It is the one that you can pick flavors of the Coke. I like the Dasani Sensations (fizzy water with a little bit of flavor). The noodles are good, not GREAT, but they are good. And one of the most important things to say is that for Oakland during the lunch rush, your food will come quick. Also, they keep the restaurant very clean and have their staff come around to clear your plates for you just like a real restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the huge menu selection! Ended up choosing the mac-and-cheese with the parmesan chicken and it was pretty tasty. Wish there had been more chicken, that was the definite highlight of the meal. Decent prices and portions though, I will go again!"}
{"text":"I got the Pad Thai with tofu, and the Thai Curry soup. Both were extremely flavorful and nice portions. Service was awesome. My favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place when we were out doing some shopping.  It's a great find!  I had the pesto pasta with meatballs and my boyfriend had the Japanese noodles with pork.  We will be back to try new things! They have a good selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Fast food that covers multiple cuisines and is well prepared?  I'm in.  We discovered this place while on a business trip.  It is right by our offices in Madison, so it was very convenient.  The facilities are very basic, but when you're in for a quick meal as you're going through you busy day, it's ideal.  Service was just fine each time we went in.  I'm happy to know there is some fast, tasty food available for a weary business gal."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, 3 strikes your out. I didn't like my food all 3 times I went there. The parmesan crusted chicken had to have been a frozen cut up chicken patty. I really wanted to like this place because I love Italian food & I live close by but I didn't."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Poor customer service. The manager was literally yelling when we complained there were no vegetables in the noodles. And when i went to get the free appetizer for completing the survey, they ask me what rating i gave them. Would never go to this restaurant and wouldn't recommend.."}
{"text":"The truffle Mac and cheese was so good! I also enjoyed the Bombay noodles, great curry flavor and fresh veggies!"}
{"text":"We need to go back and try more items. I did think that the pasta dishes were lacking sauce. The staff was very nice/friendly."}
{"text":"Beware when ordering online. Once we got our food home, we discovered the Mediterraean salad was missing salad dressing AND the kalamata olives. So back we went to get the missing ingredients. All we received was a \"sorry;\" our meal was not comped for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"I order noodles with tofu and a mac and cheese from the kids menu for my little girl my husband order mac and cheese BBQ .. portion was really small for the adult dish .. the noddles did not have any flavor I had to add soy  sauce and siracha .. when the manager ask how was everything I told him the portion is really small and don't have flavor .. he said oh I know .. the bowls are so big and out portions are really small .. so why are you serving on this bowls ? I wish I can have my money back"}
{"text":"Came here looking for something new. This place is awesome.  I had the mac and cheese.   Really generous portions. And fair prices.  Atmosphere is great. Lots of great looking dishes on the menu. Looking forward to trying them. Employees are very friendly and willing to please."}
{"text":"In no mood to battle the never-ending lunch line-ups, I gave the online ordering system a whirl. The website is easy to navigate, and there aren't SO many options that you feel overwhelmed. You pick what kind of pasta/noodle/bowl you want (ranging from Mac n Cheese to Indonesian noodles!), pick a size, and protein (grilled chicken, breaded chicken, shrimp, steak, tofu). There's also a drop down menu where you can customize your order.  You can create an account or check out as guest (which I did). I selected the pick-up ASAP option and the system told me the order would be ready in 8 minutes. You pay in person.  Showed up shortly before noon and there was no line-up. I ended up paying at the regular cashier because no one was there but I think there's a separate cashier for pick-ups only. Food was out right away!  Speaking of... I ordered a small Bangkok Curry ($5.39) plus grilled chicken ($3.49). Rice noodles were covered in a slightly sweet coconut curry. Stir fried with broccoli, carrots, onions, peppers. The flavor was OK, nothing spectacular, but satisfying. The grilled chicken was very lightly seasoned and went well with the noodles. The fatty in me was a bit disappointed to see the size of the serving initially but the takeout bowl is more deep than it is wide, so don't despair. The closer I got to the bottom of the bowl, the more full I started to feel, until Inner Fatty was fully satisfied. I'm glad I didn't opt for the regular size.  There's so much variety in pasta/noodle options, I would go back, and the online ordering def streamlines the process.   The 1,000-cal Mac n Cheese beckons (yes, calories are listed. I suggest squinting your eyes to blur out the numbers and enjoy a guilt-free lunch)."}
{"text":"It is ok and good for a quick bite. Good for take outs and a better healthy options would have been great."}
{"text":"I was expecting just Pho noodles and was surprised by the menu.  My wife got the Curry, I got the Pad Thai & Tomato Basil Soup and our daughter got the Mac and Cheese.  I tried everything and the Curry was good, however everything else was meh.  My sister-in-law got a Wisconsin Philly.  She wasn't a fan.  I wouldn't go back with so many other options nearby."}
{"text":"Decent although the prices exclude meat, so it came as a shock when my final price was much higher than the advertised price. Had the penne rosa with crusted chicken"}
{"text":"I came here today as I saw this driving by. At first I thought it would be like a Ramen house from the outside. Nope I was wrong. Once I entered in I saw different kinds of bowls and wasn't too sure if I wanted to eat here. I saw one dish that caught my eye which was of course Asian fusion. So I ordered the small which came with udon noodles and steak. It was good I thought but it was not amazing though. The serving was so tiny and there was not enough noodles. I had about 4 bites and it was already gone. Very disappointed with the serving size   I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. 3 stars is for the excellent service and sweet guy at the cashier. He seemed very happy to be there and at his job."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. First I got the mac &cheese, which was just ok. They definitely could improve it by using freshly shredded cheese rather than pre-packaged. The second time I went there I got the Pad Thai. Decent food, but a tad over-priced for the quality.  We will go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Veracruz Salad ($9.98) & a side of tomato basil bisque soup ($1.50). The salad was big! Although it looks huge, it felt like there was a lot of stuff but pretty airy in between. In fact there weren't that much lettuce in the bowl, mostly chicken, fried jalapenos, and onions.The jalapenos were crispy and quite spicy, nice kick to the salad. It was nice that they served fresh corn off the cob, but sucked that they couldn't served fresh chicken. It was clearly processed chicken, like the sliced ones you buy in a pack at the grocery store. The soup was good, slightly sweet and not that sour."}
{"text":"Well their food isn't bad at all. I actually enjoy the Udon noodles dish they offer. It's their customer service at this particular location that is a real turn off. The last time I called in an order for take out, the person on the phone just didn't seem to care too much about anything. It was weird. They were out of basics, like tomatoes, with my wife's order and steak for my order. The girl on the phone didn't apologize or even offer any substitutes. When I arrived to pick up the food, I was greeted with the same type of attitude, like it was my fault they were out of everything. I'll be back at Noodles & Company but just not this location."}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this place for a while. We finally got down there. First off Frank was amazing. Took us through the menu. Explained the customizing. Even made suggestions. I had the Indonesian noodle bowl with the flatbread appetizer. I ordered the small size, I was really happy with it. The bowl was just spicy enough that it didn't burn your face off. The only thing I would have changed about it, was I found it dry. It needed s little but if moisture. The flat bread was so good. It had tomatoes and spinach and cheese on it. I'm being told it's been taken off the menu next week. My mom had the meatballs and the hotpot with pulled pork and chicken. It was really good. A nice coconut broth that was really creamy without being heavy. The veggies were fresh and cooked well. The meatball....I would order those and bring them home and eat them by the bucket. Sooooo good. Over all I can't wait to try the new menus. I will be back."}
{"text":"It's good, I had the Indonesian Peanut Sauté.  Service was good, fast, and friendly.  I recommend putting on the menu.  Korean beef and spicy pork bulgogi and my friends want crab puffs for appetizer.  The kids menu is coming soon so this company is good for the whole family."}
{"text":"The food here surpassed my expectations. Everything was plated well and the flavor was divine. I got the Alfredo Montamore and the Korean BBQ Meatballs and my wife got the Korean Noodles. Probably the best we've ever had. Very impressive for a mall food court."}
{"text":"I was kind of excited when I saw this place was opening (even though it went in the place of 5 & Diner, which I loved!). I haven't eaten at a Noodles & Company in probably 15 years, so I was interested to try it again. I decided to get good old fashioned spaghetti & meatballs and shared some garlic bread with my other half. The garlic bread was pretty good, but the spaghetti was a very poor choice. The meatballs were obviously your average, boring, frozen meatballs. The sauce really didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and there wasn't enough of it, so the noodles were very plain tasting. Very disappointing. If I do ever decide to come back, I will definitely get something else."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tried it after getting a coupon in my email and have gone back 3 times in the last month. They have a variety of noodle dishes that some can also be made low-carb for people like myself and fully customizable.  The salads are great to and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I always get the Japanese pan noodle, it's so good. The staffs are nice and if you do a survey under your ticket you can get a free appetizer"}
{"text":"Barely three stars Noodles is ok, but it could be much more. Not as many Asian themed selections as I was anticipating but the dish I had was fine for the price.  Ok for lunch, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I have been to better noodles & company that did a better job. The mushroom stroganoff was short on meat, and I haven't liked it much since they went away from braised beef."}
{"text":"The girls in the office and I got take out here yesterday. None of us had been here before. I wanted to give it a try mainly because of the gluten free pasta and noodles offerings. I got the regular sized Pesto Cavatappi with the GF [fusilli] noodles ($1.59 extra), and added chicken (about $2 and change). Although my pasta was warm, it was quite delicious. I think it could have used a touch more sauce but overall it was good and I ate the whole thing. Two coworkers got the Pad Thai and said that it was very dry. Perhaps more sauce would have made it better. Another peer ordered the small Japanese Pan Noodles and also the small Penne Rosa. Although she enjoyed the penne, she said the pan noodles fell short of her expectations. We were all a little shocked at just how small the small servings are. The pan noodles literally had maybe 4 longish noodles in it. My work peers probably won't give it a 2nd try, but I enjoyed my meal and I would absolutely go back. If this location is really brand new, perhaps they just need to iron out a few things and perhaps this review will assist with that. I wish them all the best."}
{"text":"I eat at noodles at least 3 times a week!  It is a filling inexpensive meal.  I order the Penne Rosa with extra sauce.  I also substitute the mushrooms for spinach.  The spiciness of the food is perfect: great taste, but not too spicy that it overpowers the food.  I can never make my penne rosa at home taste this great!  I have tried the pad thai and indonesian peanut sautee, but did not like them as much as the penne rosa."}
{"text":"I love eating at Noodles. The food is delicious, and the service is quick. The only complaint is that this particular location is often times dirty. I mean, really dirty. A lot of families bring their kids, which just means that the place gets messy...and then it stays that way. At least a couple of times now I've gone in there and have had to literally stand and look at each table until I found one that was cleaned (this happened today, which is why I'm writing this--in hopes that they might be better about it in the future). The entire time we were there eating, nobody came out to clear all the dirty plates. It was sort of gross (but fun to watch other people play musical chairs, as well, haha). Weirdly, I think it happens usually when the place is slow. When there are lots of people, they're good about it, but I guess when they're not too busy they just wait until there are very few tables available before they do a sweep of the whole place.  Anyway, I still think this place is great--the food is better than the Mineral Point location, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Noodles was the first restaurant I ever ate at in Madison. I came with my mom and sister when I was in high school and I've been a fan ever since!  It is a chain, which isn't always my favorite, but I am never disappointed when I stop here. Their Wisconsin Mac & Cheese is comfort food at its finest, but they're recently revamped their menu and some of their newer dishes are a little \"fancier\"."}
{"text":"As a fast casual restaurant it's about on par with what you'd expect. Noodles are great from anywhere so you can mix and match different types of cuisines of you want.  Best best is to get a small bowl and add a side salad or soup for a dollar more. Always been more than enough food to hit the spot."}
{"text":"The current average for this place is 3.5 stars. I think that is reasonable. I have only been here once, and there is nothing on the menu that is necessarily drawing me here, but I would come back. The family consensus was that it was \"OK,\" which is 3 stars on the Yelp-o-meter.   I had the Korean Beef noodle bowl, and it was good. There was a nice amount of spice, the beef was tender and the noodles were cooked well. I like cilantro, and that flavor was definitely prevalent in this dish. I can't speak to the Korean authenticity of the dish, but it had a nice flavor and the crunchy veggies paired well with the spicy sauce and noodles.  The counter service people were friendly and the food was served quickly, despite the place being pretty much at capacity.  If everyone in the family wants some kind of noodles for dinner, but nobody can agree on exactly what kind, head over here and let everyone choose their own style. They have everything from spaghetti and meatballs to various macaroni and cheeses, a simple noodles and butter, and more \"interesting\" offerings like Thai Green Curry with Shrimp or Spicy Chipotle Adobo."}
{"text":"The soda machine is the key reason to go here. It's cool. You pick a type, e.g., Diet Coke, and you can put like 6 different syrups into it. Yum! They also have 3 flavors of iced tea.  The food, however, is eh and overpriced. I usually get the mac & cheese, and my daughter likes the pesto. They're fine. You can put things into the dish which we usually do, e.g., chicken and extra veggies. However, doing so increases the price and quickly adds up. I also don't like how they put raw spinach into my dish. It's a hot dish. The spinach should be cooked.  The service is iffy. They sometimes have clueless people working the register which I cannot understand because a) it gives a negative impression and b) it slows things down. My register person could not answer simple questions like, \"Are there mushrooms in that dish?\" (yes) or \"Can I switch out for the gluten-free noodles?\" (yes).   The food runners are usually quick to bring your meal to the table, and so far, it's always been hot.  They do have gluten-free noodles! Yeah!  Bottom line: You get the same things (except the awesome soda machine) faster and cheaper within a few blocks."}
{"text":"It was so bland spent almost $12 on a small pad Thai with chicken that was not good at all :(("}
{"text":"I came in before they opened to their grand opening party event. I had their buttered noodles and chicken and let me say it was amazing. My mother ordered their Mac n cheese with steak and after trying some of hers I was in heaven. The staff was very friendly as well. I don't know why there's so many bad reviews on here. I've only ever had a good experience.   Not to mention I also loved their tomato soup."}
{"text":"Great fresh food.  The 'small' is plenty big.  The folks that work there are VERY nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful jewel of a restaurant. Healthy as you want it to be. Lots of mix and match possible.   My two sons, husband and I eat there at least once per week. Tried many items, and the only item we have ordered that we didn't care for the stroganoff.   I think the whole grain Tuscan linguine is out of this world, and substitute spinach for the mushrooms to get a bit more green in my diet. The mac and cheese is adored by both sons, and we always add their amazing chicken Parmesan to the top of our noodle meal for protein. Delicious!   The service is friendly and they even remember us!   I took both of my bosses and they loved it. One likes spicy food and ordered the Indonesian peanut saute'. He enjoyed it and wants to go back next time he's in town."}
{"text":"Not enough non-spicy options. Even the Pad Thai is too spicy for me, which is not supposed to be. However, the Korean BBQ meatball is excellent and if I come again I would definitely get the meatball."}
{"text":"One of my co-workers wanted to try this place out, so I agreed. Unfortunately, I didn't see the other Yelp reviews until The order was already placed.  The food was average at best. There are two reasons I am giving two stars (and neither one is for the quality of food).  *1 we placed an online order and I asked for one order to be split. The request was fulfilled, which made it easier for me.  *2 the order was packaged and waiting for me upon my arrival. Included utensils and napkins. The employee was super nice and he offered me a handle bag to make it easier to carry. Kudos to him!  The food: I am not a cook, but I could make better noodles at home. It was nothing special and not very flavorful. No need to go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti and meatballs w a side Cesar's salad which was teeny tiny.  He had the Japanese pan noodles w 4 Korean BBQ meatballs and we paid $30.  The pasta was better than spaghetti factory. The 4 meatballs I got tasted like the frozen ones I heat up from Costco, nothing special. He enjoyed the pan noodles but agreed w me about the meatballs. We probably won't be back. I took one star away for the pricey-ness and another star for the heat up meatballs."}
{"text":"I tend to do a lot on this part of State Street with volunteering and events so when I'm rushed for a dinner, I come to Noodles.  I can usually get in and order quickly.  I think I have only walked out of line once due to a slow cashier.  With the ordering app, that has changed the game a lot.  I order around the menu so most things are good to me.  Only thing I avoid is the pot stickers.  It's just sad to get flat pot stickers.  I get you can not have fast without squashing them between to hot pans but...just sad."}
{"text":"Had a lunch outing at the University Ave Noodles & Company.  I ordered the pesto with chicken.  The pesto had a different taste than I had it before.  It wasn't bad it was just different.  I long for consistancy of flavors.  The biggest disappointment was the potstickers.  I mean, how flat can they get?  They are supposed to be pillows that are fried on both sides for a crispy factor.  The press that they go through here takes all the air out of them and the filling inside is really lost to the pancake-ness of the dough.  I try not to get them but my friends are always hoping for the best.  The potstickers are not worth the money, not when you can get better ones at Double 10 or Dumpling Haus."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time yesterday and ordered the Buff Japanese Pan w Marinated Steak.  The nutrition facts for the options are pretty scary so I figured something named Buff would be a safer option.  It was actually pretty good.    The highlight of the experience was the amazing soda machine.  (I'm from the South... I say soda and you say pop).  It blew my mind.  I hope to win the lottery and purchase one so I can jerryrig it into a wine dispensary for my living room."}
{"text":"Why is everybody complaining about the size of this restaurant? That's the size, deal with it or take your food to go. And kids? Really, you're on the West side of Madison, buddy...deal with it! But, i do admit it gets busy, but who doesn't like a busy restaurant? That means the food is good, right?  Your bill  can go quite high if you add a protein (chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu, and just recently new meatballs).  Only complaint, potstickers are terrible, they have no flavor. They look delicious, but do not be fooled. My favorite dish (and of many others) is the penne rosa.    Except a crowd around lunchtime, and expect kids...when in doubt!  Oh, and great staff here, always friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered online, which is super convenient. I had the med chicken salad. It was tasty but would have been much better if they remembered the dressing ?. Overall, I'd go back but would check my order first."}
{"text":"When I go to a mall located, counter service, chain restaurant my expectations are usually not very high. Unfortunately Noodles & Company failed to meet my already low expectations.    While the service and flavor of our dishes was good this location missed the mark on the first rule of cooking.  Serve it hot.  My wife, daughter, and I each had different noodle bowls and we split an order of potstickers none of which was served any warmer than room temperature.  Not only does this create a poor dining experience but it also has to make me wonder about the temperature sauces and other products are held at in the kitchen.   Nice concept but poor execution."}
{"text":"I just had my first, and probably last, meal at Noodles & Company. The service was friendly, but the food was awful. I got the Japanese Udon Noodles with steak. I will say that my dish LOOKED amazing, but don't be deceived by the photos. It tasted nothing like how it looked. The noodles were dry, and the steak was spongy. I've never thought to use spongy as a word to describe steak, but it suits it perfectly. It almost seemed like it was reconstituted. There was also a strange flavor to my dish that I couldn't quite identify. It stood out as strange and didn't go with the sauce. I drink iced tea almost every time I eat out, and the iced tea at Noodles & Company was very bitter (even the sweetened version). After how bad my meal was, I don't have faith that a different dish will be any better and probably won't risk eating there again."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my mac n' cheese.  Maybe it was just a bad batch or something because i have heard its really good from a couple of reputable sources.  O well, luckily there is no shortage of places to get good mac in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars because I love the food, but my order was ruined 3 times in a row & I'm a regular customer. I'm very disappointed and I'm probably going to take a break from coming here"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place... Great food and incredible staff, not to mention it is the perfect location!  Will for sure be back for more!"}
{"text":"(This review is just for this branch). After 30 minutes of waiting (not to forget everyone after me getting their order first), having burnt potstickers! Awesome! :( thank you guyz now i am late for work. I am just asuming that this whole experience was based on my race. Never mind. I am not going to avoid the restaurant just because of this branch."}
{"text":"After a long weekend of traveling, I was treated to a meal at Noodles & Company. Upon inspection of their menu, I was surprised to see that there were not a lot of soup based noodles but finally settled on the Japanese pan noodle dish. It came out quickly and was delicious, especially after adding some saracha. My only con about the dish was that the sprouts were not cooked but placed on top raw. The kitchen is in back of the cashiers which is nice so you can kind of see what is happening and this is a seat yourself place. I like there are some high tables and low tables for which you can sit at and the service was friendly. There was a homeless man who wandered into the store asking for money at each of the tables but one of the workers stepped in to ask the man to leave, made sure that the homeless man left and then apologized to the patrons which I thought was handled very nicely. There were quite a few people eating at this establishment at about 8pm on a Sunday. I think I will go back and try a pasta dish."}
{"text":"Average chain restaurant.  It's what you'd expect from a noodles and company but nothing more.  Service is average as is the food, but what more do you expect from a chain (basically) fast food restaurant?"}
{"text":"Authentic Taste with fusion style dishes. This is an impressive place. Located in Market Square downtown. They have 3 main dish categories, American, Mediterranean and Asian, pasta or salad, with your choice of protein (Meatballs, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp or Tofu).   Having lived in Thai Town (part of Los Angeles), I was curious to try the Asian dishes. It was VERY GOOD! Cilantro, Lime, just the right amount of spice, quick and filling.   http://www.noodles.com/nutrition/  Use the site above to check your dish of interest, because some of them do have High Calories and Sodium. Average 700+ Calories & 1000mg+ Sodium."}
{"text":"I went to Noodles and Company three times in one week. I tried it out one day and then I went back because I wanted to try another dish. The employees were pretty helpful the first time I visited which was nice. I also like that they have tofu and getting something vegetarian isn't a problem at all. I got the Japanese udon noddles with tofu the first time. It was a bit saltier than I would have liked so I would not order that again. I still ate it all though. The second time I went, there was a really nice guy with a curly mustache at the register. I ordered the Indonesian peanut sauté and requested no sprouts on my meal because they literally just dump a handful of sprouts on your food at the end (I hate spouts). I also asked for more cilantro to be mixed into my food. They list cilantro in the ingredient list but it's only used as garnish which is misleading in my opinion. So I got my food to go and the guy was so proud when he handed me my food  reassuring me he made sure they mixed the cilantro into my food. I appreciate that he paid attention to that detail but I also asked for no sprouts and extra broccoli instead of the sprouts. I looked in my bag and there is a whole bunch of sprouts all over my food!!!! (See photo) ughhhh! The extra cilantro was just two long stems of cilantro mixed in the noodles. The meal would have been the same without it. The noodles were delicious and the tofu they use is pretty nice and firm and well cooked. I didn't get extra broccoli though. I think if you're going to give people the option to change things then do it right. I went back again a couple days later and got another Indonesian peanut sauté and they got it right this time. I didn't ask for any extra cilantro that time.  I mean why bother if they aren't gonna even rip the leaves off the stem. I'm glad they didn't put the sprouts on there like I asked though. The Indonesian peanut sauté is delicious. I would recommend it. I'll go back again and try something else. It seems like they are quite new so hopefully they get it together and become a bit more consistent."}
{"text":"The food here is honestly not too bad. Only reason I'm leaving two stars is because their service is awful.  One of the waitresses accidentally spilled chili sauce on my pants. I get accidents happen so that's not why I'm mad. I'm mad because after she spilled it on me, she said, and I quote \"Oops, oh well.\" And walked away. A simple sorry or I'll grab a towel to get that wiped off would be nice! Ugh!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place ever since it opened and we finally did. It was a major disappointment.  I originally decided to give this place one star which I've never done on any other restaurants, however, I changed my mind to 1.5 and rounded up to 2-star thinking I might was being a little too harsh on it.  I had a salad which I do not remember the name of but it sucked... Looking out the window and seeing Panera across the street, I couldn't help but only comparing these 2 places.  My friend ordered some kind of pan-fried noodle and it was pan-burnt.  I will never go back to this place to eat."}
{"text":"Great service!! The girl at the cash register, didn't get her name but she had red hair, she is so sweet and very attentive! Food is good! When they say spicy they mean SPICY so I would just be mindful of that. Their rice crispy treat are delicious!"}
{"text":"The kindest people I have had an encounter with in a while. I arrived to order food late and had issues with my card being read and I was truly touched with the patience and respect I was treated with"}
{"text":"Pasta bowls galore and more.  When visiting family in Phoenix and we are always up to trying something new in the culinary department.  Yes, this is fast food but on the really healthy side.  If you are a lover of Pasta Bowls this is worth the trip. I had the Pad Thai Rice Noodles scrambled egg, cabbage, cilantro, lime, sprouts and green onions. You can add any Meat or Tofu to your bowl for a small charge. I had the seasoned Tofu which was crisply seasoned and perfect to the taste buds.  Also I asked for the peanuts.  This came out steaming hot and a huge plate.  They have small plates but the regular size is just $1.25 for twice the amount of food.  Hubby had the Japanese Pan Noodles,odon noodles in a sweet soy sauce broccoli, carrots, shiitake mushrooms. sprouts. black sesame seeds and cilantro.  Also steaming hot and delicious.  There were 16 choices of noodle and pasta dishes.  They have a Thai Chicken soup that was incredible and if you add it to your bowl it is only $1.50 extra.  Can't wait  to try other dishes. They cater as well.  Yes, it is a chain but this is an exception to my food snobby ways.  Wish they would come to Tucson. Also have lots of non Asian bowls such as Pasta with Meatballs, Mac and Cheese with assorted goodies in it."}
{"text":"The service at this location is outstanding.  At my last visit, both my order and my friend's order were made as a regular size instead of the small size we ordered.  We were not charged extra and the server who brought the food to our table gave us both a doggie box to take it home should we not finish the large size portion.  The space is located in a very affluent and happening area.  Is is very clean inside and the bathrooms are kept spotless.  There is an outside option for seating as well.   The food was very high quality with great presentation.  I was very pleased with the freshness of the ingredients in my chicken sesame salad.  The cucumber slices were sliced to perfection with an excellent crisp texture.  There are lots of things to do in this area so grab some noodles, and explore the amazing things the area has to offer."}
{"text":"There are not many vegan options in this area, so when I heard that this place was vegan-friendly, I decided to try them for lunch.   There aren't a lot of options here and the lady taking my order didn't even know what vegan meant.  I played it safe and went with the Japanese Pan Noodles, which are made with udon noodles (which I know to be vegan). I omitted the mushrooms and chose tofu as my protein.   The dish was good, but nothing stood out as being superb or outstanding.  They could've put more broccoli in this dish; I only saw a few minuscule pieces of broccoli stems.  Nonetheless, the portion was good and I was full before I even finished the bowl.   I wouldn't voluntarily seek out this place again, but if there was absolutely nothing else around, I'd go back."}
{"text":"They were out of chicken on Friday evening and o I got beef. Like another reviewer below the beef tasted fine but looked very grey and strange. The food tasted good but the noodle were too mushy in the Indonesian sauté. Also I felt it was too pricey for the quality. Service staff was excellent."}
{"text":"I like Noodles as a chain and the location here in Madison is a nice walk if you're meandering about downtown.  The cashiers don't seem very enthusiastic about having to work here though and asking questions about menu items is somewhat of a painful process.  But the food is consistent with other Noodles locations and the inside of the restaurant is clean with plenty of places to find a corner to relax in."}
{"text":"Very nice staff! The service was quick and attentive. Good noodle dishes, salads, and soups. I think we've tried them all!"}
{"text":"It's not bad but it not amazing either can be used to describe the pricey yet low quality of food from Noodles & Company. In terms of picking the type of food you want, there is limited options but it cost about $2.75 extra to add protein: tofu, chicken, shrimp in comparison to an order without meat.   I got an order of regular pad thai with shrimp which is $8.75, but the quantity of shrimp is about 5 and the the noodles barely filled half of the bowl. Initially, I thought getting a regular would be too much but after eating the whole meal I realized it was not enough. Well at least I was able to finish the meal, but again amount of food was small."}
{"text":"This Tuesday, my boyfriend and I checked out this Noodles & Company located on the east side of Madison in Sun Prairie based upon my suggestion of checking out a place with noodles. So we drove by in passing while in the area and decided to give it a try!   Although it was our first time at this east side location, I've been to other chain locations so I knew what I wanted to order after looking at the menu. I ordered a large Pad Thai with shrimp (without cilantro or green onions), with a side of pot stickers to share. My boyfriend got a Parmesan chicken penne and a side of Korean BBQ meatballs. All in all, given the palette of different flavors, it was an interesting combination of various cultural food but it was good nonetheless. The sauce for the meatballs were particularly delicious and definitely wouldn't have mind getting the larger size to share.   Additionally, there's the fancy new soda fountain on the side, and I got creative making a Sprite & Peach with Ginger ale & lime combo, adding a slice of lemon as well! Quite a delicious citrus lemon lime combo, so do give this a try! (Always the possibility of making another drink if that doesn't quite suit your tastebuds).   Since we were cutting it close to the start of our movie time at the nearby theater, we ordered our food in take out containers, in case we couldn't finish and we had to rush through eating it. Had we known that we would've finished most of the food, we could've grabbed take out containers at the table next to the soda fountain or just asked for one if needed next time. This way, we could've sat in the outside patio area and waited for our food to be bought out to us.   All in all, a decent dining experience and I'd say we'll go and check it out again sometime soon and try out another combination on the menu."}
{"text":"Found this place while searching for a lunch spot. The food was nice and fresh with excellent flavor. Clean and tidy Restaraunt and our food came quickly and was served on pretty clean white dishes. Would def go back again."}
{"text":"This is my second meal at this place and my second experience of NOT being disappointed.   This time I am having the Spicy Korean Beef Noodles. Has two jalapeños next to the calorie notes on the menu and yes, it has a kick. Leaves a very nice feeling on the lips but certainly not enough of a spice to stop eating. This dish is awesome! Very nice sauce and spice.   You order like it's fast food but they serve you at your table and the place has a great atmosphere like a sit down restaurant. I told one of the employees that they were out of forks next to the soda machine and he brought us two forks instead of just refilling the bucket and making us go get them. That's good service..."}
{"text":"Our family's go-to fast food when, none of us want pizza, chinese, or burgers and such. There always seems to be something for everyone. Mac and cheese is awesome, but way too boring as a my main meal, i just steal a bite from the kids. The pesto cavatappi is really good, especially paired with grilled chicken. The penne Rosa is also wonderful. They had a truffle macaroni and cheese for a limited time, and I suppose it's good it was limited, because Lord Almighty, it was good... rich and good. I really miss it. I used to love the pad thai, but recently have been disappointed as it seems dry and lacking in flavors and ingredients. The Indonesian peanut saute is great, although a little spicy if that's a concern. Orders are always swiftly prepared and hot."}
{"text":"I've went twice and the noodles were WAY undercooked both times.  I understand al dente but the noodles shouldn't crunch... won't be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food was above average and very flavorful. I honestly forgot what I ordered but I remember being pleasantly full. The portions were huge!   I have a nut allergy and I appreciate them takin it extremely seriously. You can't always find service like that.   Prices were a little above average for what you get but I can say it was worth it."}
{"text":"I've never liked the their concept of fusion cuisine when it first came to Champaign. They tried to introduce noodles from different places but they never tasted authentic. The Indonesian peanut noodle was not appetizing and their pastas were, uhm, never mind. Try it and you'll know."}
{"text":"Seriously bomb dot com! Amazing food ! It took me like 20 minutes to order because I couldn't decide what I wanted I ended up getting the Alfredo mont amore. I defiantly suggest it . Not to creamy and not to bland . I do feel the mushrooms and tomatoes could have been grilled a little Longer but super good no complaints here ."}
{"text":"Noodles was a twice a week staple for me when I lived in Salt Lake City. I was excited to see one open up at Tempe Marketplace.   I got the Tuscan Fresca with grilled chicken and it was just ok, and def not what I remember. They clearly changed the chicken they use it used to be served as a whole breast that was really juicy and fresh. This chicken was just sad, dried out,  pre-cooked and clearly reheated....cockadoodle don't.   Three stars cuz it tasted OK otherwise it would be a two."}
{"text":"Preatty good we go between games or whenever we tired of out schedule and no willing to cook it's always good service"}
{"text":"After hearing some good things, I had to check it out. I ordered the Japanese noodles with shrimp. The shrimp and flavoring was great, but the vegetables were so undercooked, crunchy & cold, and the noodles overlooked, sticky and hard. The service was good though, very sweet girl at the counter."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. They get orders wrong regularly and don't do anything to fix their mistakes. Last Friday I came in around 6pm and ordered a fruit spinach salad. I get home to find out there's no fruit on my fruit spinach salad. I call the restaurant and speak to Katie and let her know what happened. She apologizes and offers to send me two coupons in the mail for free entrees instead of me driving all the way back to the restaurant to fix their mistake. I accept. It's now almost a week later and I still haven't received any free coupons from them and I'm out the extra money I paid to have fruit in my salad. I called and spoke to Katie again and told her I still haven't received the coupons in the mail and I'm leaving next week to a city that does not have a noodles & company so I would like to use them before I leave. She claims she is going to put another set of coupons in the mail for me but if I don't receive them by this weekend I'll be coming in for a refund. I also contacted corporate and got no response. So basically you give them your money but they don't have to give you what you paid for and refuse to fix their mistakes. I'll update my review if something is done about them getting my order wrong. I'd also like to mention this is not the first time my order has been wrong this is just the first time I'm complaining about it."}
{"text":"The place is extremely clean, probably due to the fact that when the place is slow the workers are CLEANING THE WALLS, literally. We went Easter Sunday so it wasn't busy but instead of just sitting around collecting a paycheck these employees were earning it by cleaning! Just moments before we saw this I commented on how spotless the place was, now we know why!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this brand new noodle place in pickering so I cam here with my niece .  Wasn't too busy when we came in which is great.  Had the Bangkok curry noodle and my niece had the steak stroganoff.    Portions were good and the food was delish and fresh. People are nice too.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"This location is in a beautifully sunbathed space with plenty of windows. The staff couldn't be nicer! Ian, who took my order helped me to navigate the menu until I decided on the perfect main and side. Bryce, who brought us our food, was extremely gracious -asking us if we needed anything else and then again when he asked us how our food was tasting so far.  This is one of the nicest Noodles I've been to. Now if they could only bring back the Indonesian Peanut Sauté dish that I love."}
{"text":"It was freezing inside the restaurant. Didn't get what I ordered, but what I did get was good none the less.  Staff was super friendly.  I will give it another shot.  Maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"First time here.  I got the regular size Japanese Pan Fire, and pot stickers to go. It was super awesomely priced! About $10 for those two things.  The noodle bowl was disappointing. Sadly :( I love noodles. Their Udon noodles are on the thicker, more short side for udon noodles. They seemed over cooked since they were very chewy and sticky. The bowl lacked flavor, and was very dry. Not very much sauce/ left over juice in it. It comes with broccoli, sprouts, carrots, and shitake mushrooms. It came with 4 broccoli pieces, tiny bit of thinly sliced carrots, and less than a handful of sprouts. It was deff lacking on the veggies. I'm used to traditional Japanese restaurants, so maybe it actually had an okay amount and I'm used to a lot. I also thought the serving was very small, but it was cheap so I'm not iffed. The pot stickers were not great. The ones I buy at sprouts for $6 a bag are better. They were limp, and soggy despite being pan fried . The dipping sauce it came with was okay. Though it had a strong taste of alcohol? Not vinegar, alcohol. Over all, I was let down. I was very hungry so I think my expectations were too high.  The staff was nice and they were picking up after customers very quickly after they left."}
{"text":"So so so good! So glad this place is near me. I got the pesto and my SO got the BBQ pork mac. Both were tasty!"}
{"text":"So, I've only been to Noodles & Co. once before, wayyyy back in my college days and in a Columbus, Ohio location (Go Buckeyes!). I remembered it fondly so on my lunch hour today I popped in for a quick bite. Sadly, the food at this one and the price have forever replaced my fond memory of this place.   I ordered a small portion of the Japanese noodles dish with grilled chicken and a small drink...almost 10 bucks. Ok, well its noodles, so at least i'll get a lot of food and have lefovers for dinner. Wrong. I watched and he literally put a small handful of noodles in the bowl and topped with dry, flavorless grilled chicken. The sauce and the veggies in the bowl were good and it tasted fine, but seriously? Its been about 3 hours and i'm already hungry again because the portion was teeny tiny. There is no reason for that, noodles are the cheapest thing! I'll never be back, I can spend ten bucks a lot of places around there and still have leftovers for dinner.   The reason I did add a star was that the staff was super friendly and helpful. From the girl that checked on me while I was staring up at the menu to the guy cleaning the tables and asking me how my dish was, everyone was really wam and inviting. Doesn't make up for the food and price though, pass."}
{"text":"While my pesto was good, my chicken was not. My son's grilled chicken breast was greasy. The entire place is dirty. Tables not cleaned or wiped down, and the floor looked liked it had not been swept all day. We were not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Just about like any other noodles & co. Today though tables but being bussed, employees eating with 3 tables around them not cleared. My family is sitting at two sperate tables instead of one because they are not bussing. Poor management!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't crazy about my meal. I'd been wanting to try Noodles & Co since before I moved because they had just put one up by my old job but I never got around to it. So you can imagine how ecstatic I was when my new job sent out an email about a fundraiser at a new Noodles & Co right by my favorite supermarket where I needed to go that day anyway. So, I actually don't remember what organization the fundraiser was for but I'm going to make an assumption that based off of my appearance (I'm black, in case you couldn't tell) they thought I wasn't going to donate any money so they pretty much skipped over me when explaining what they were all about and what they were trying to accomplish. I ended up donating but I wish I hadn't afterwards once I had really take in the fact that they almost completely ignored my presence. BUT, I digress because that actually has nothing to do with Noodles & Co as an establishment. It  would be unfair for me to rate the atmosphere because this was before they actually opened and since this was technically a \"free\" event, it was packed out. The line was out the door and once inside there was a waiter asking whether we wanted to dine in or out. Initially I wanted to eat in but I could see that he was obviously very stressed by the lack of seating and the never-ending line of people requesting to dine in so I opted to eat in my car and he thanked me, lol. My food was just okay. I ordered the Japanese pan noodles with the steak. The steak was good and at first I was really into my noodles but as I dug deeper, there was definitely an underlying flavor of burnt. I wasn't sure if it was coming from the black sesame seeds because my noodles didn't look burnt but the taste made it so I couldn't even finish my noodles. I ate maybe 1/3 of the dish and ended up tossing it. I'm actually really thankful that I was able to try Noodles & Co for a small donation as opposed to having come here on my own because I think having paid full price for the meal would have left me extremely disappointed. I don't think I'll be giving them another try but I would recommend (as another Yelper also stated) to maybe stay away from their Asian options and opt for their Italian or American fare noodles. They would have probably been much better."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and I wanted to eat something spicy. Considering we were on green street, you will think we had many options. Alas, it was 9pm and half of the restaurants were closed. Why? Well I don't know why. Guess, God really wanted me to go to this restaurant and since I'm a mere mortal, I obliged to his wish. I ordered pad Thai noodles with shrimps for my husband and Indonesian peanut sauté for myself. Food arrived pretty fast. I liked peanut noodles but the pad Thai was too sweet for my taste. I don't know how my husband finished it. I mean it tastes nice if you just take 2 bites but the more you eat, the more the sweetness starts coating your tongue. But, the taste was fine and since it was raining outside, it felt nice to enjoy hot noodles. Next time, I will ask them to make it a bit spicy and less sweet, if that is possible."}
{"text":"This unbelievably busy, and quick service restaurant offers several noodles on their menu, many Asian flavored.  The prices are reasonable and i can see why my kids and husband likes the food here. For this Japanese-born adult female,  noodles were too strong on the soy sauce, and not too deep on the flavors besides salt."}
{"text":"This is one of many good Noodles locations at which I have eaten, and it does not disappoint.  While the chain may have eliminated my favorite dish (a common experience for me), the options are still varied enough to keep me coming back. There is always plenty of seating at this location, and I am please that they recently added the high end coke machine. I love the flavored dasani waters and the cherry Mello Yello.  The portions are always correct, and so far I've always received quick, courteous service. If you are in a hurry for a quick lunch or dinner, I'd recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Noodles is normally fairly quick (as all they need to do is make a ton of different kinds of noodles and it is meant to be a fast food type of restaurant). Exceedingly, this location takes an incredible amount of time, even giving warnings of taking 45-1 hours to make your meal. The food is normal per the franchise, but if you want a quick experience or meal, do not chose this location."}
{"text":"Food is generally ok. Unfortunately this location has a real cleanliness problem. Tables were not cleaned for the 10 min we waited. Even after cleaning away the previous good tables were not wiped."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, but the service at this particular location is horrible. I always order a tomato basil bisque as a side for whatever pasta I get, and the staff members routinely forget to put it in my bag when I order to go. So on the 4th time that this happened, by the time I realized they had forgotten again I was too far away from the store to turn around and go back. I decided to take the survey offered on the receipt and I detailed what happened and the recurring issue that I was having with this location. A couple of days later I received an email from the General Manager of this location apologizing and promising a FREE MEAL for myself AND a guest. I responded to the email asking if I should just present the email next time I ordered or if I should be expecting to receive a coupon of some sort, I received no response. On the night I decided to get dinner from there again I was getting off late so I just forwarded my girlfriend the email for her to show whenever she ordered our food. When my girlfriend went to the restaurant to order our food she explained the situation and presented the email, what she was given was essentially a $12 voucher for our food and was left to pay the remaining $15 of the bill. Since when does $12 cover the cost of two free meals from noodles and company? Needless to say I was and still am disappointed, and I believe this location has lost our business for good. I'm left to believe customer satisfaction is too far down on this particular location's list of priorities. These mistakes by the staff members happen far too often and then they don't even have the decency to rectify their actions by fulfilling a promise given by their General Manager, that's terrible. I won't spending any money here in the future."}
{"text":"So far I've experienced awesome service from this location. Some differences from other noodles locations: they don't bring out silverware with your food like they usually do, you have to pick it up yourself over by the soda machine. Another thing is that you now have to put away your own dishes in bins when your'e done eating. Although, staff is pretty good at seeing that your'e done and taking it from you when they're not too busy, but during busier times, expect to clean up your own dishes.  The new rewards program and app is awesome and gives you plenty of rewards. The outdoor seating at this location is great and there is a table inside that could fit a larger group. The food has always been good and tastes like any other noodles."}
{"text":"So I've never been to a Noodles & Company. For the Chipotle of noodles, it was ok. There are plenty of vegetarian options (you can build your own noodles also).  I got the Japanese pan fried noodles, which were like, pan fried udon. The noodle texture was not nice and chewy- a bit more, um, brittle? Kind of spicy, which I missed but is listed on the menu. I added tofu (pleasantly surprised with the amount of tofu), and the noodles already came with shiitake mushrooms, some broccoli, carrots, etc. Overall, noodles were ok.    Serving: way more than most ppl. finish in one sitting.  Tomato bisque:  very, very tasty. A thicker soup, but it was really good. I'd say better than the noodles.  Service was fine- people were friendly."}
{"text":"Good food but the food should have more gravy and the management keeps the AC running 24/7 so the food gets that much dryer, and you freeze your @$$ off in the summer in shorts."}
{"text":"Went to Noodles and Co for lunch with my boodle on Wednesday. They have plenty of parking and a very inviting atmosphere. I used to go to Noodles and Co in college ALL THE TIME, and this was my first time back in a while. Not much has changed, which is good! I always get the pesto cavatappi (without mushrooms). My dish came out quickly and it was hot and yummy. Something new on their menus is the calorie count per meal. I ordered pasta with pesto sauce and tomatoes, and it was over 700 calories. That seems so high to me, and I saw other dishes that were upwards of 1200 calories.  I will definitely go back to Noodles and Co; I'll just make sure I'm eating really healthy for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I love Noodles & Co. They have such a large menu, all of which can be prepared however you want. The prices are very good for somewhat healthy meal. This is by far, one of my favorite chain locations."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Noodles and Company....ever. There was a line at the door only one cashier. We saw two managers neither choose to do anything about the super long line to get customers through the line. It looked like one was dealing with a previous complaint. That should of been our signal to leave but our son really wanted Noodles and we had already invested 10 minutes in line. When we finally got to order the cashier was neither nice nor super rude but very indifferent. You think maybe she could of been a little nicer considering how long people were waiting.  After we ordered we headed upstairs. Talk about a disaster. The place was a mess, napkins, straw wrappers pretty much everything but the kitchen sink was strewn on floor. The lights weren't even on! We tried to picked the least dirty table in the place. Then we headed to the bathroom that wasn't any better, one of the soap dispensers had no presence of soap whatsoever it didn't even have a container of empty soap in it. There was even a dirty shirt on the sink counter??   We then proceeded to get our sodas. Im not sure exactly how many soda options there are but at least out of 20 there were only 4 soda choices. I had to go downstairs to get our drinks.   Finally got order, so from coming in the door to getting our food it took 35 minutes that doesn't sound fast-casual to me. The Tuscan fresca that I ordered was watery with very little feta on top. We wanted to take our son's left over food home but low and behold no to-go boxes.   After reading many of the other recent reviews it looks like this place has gone downhill and we will never ever be returning to this location...like ever."}
{"text":"Beware: they'll mess up your order every time! It's always something, today it was the seasoning on the buttered noodles. And if you enjoy eating the buttered noodles you know that's the best part. Typical, classic University Ave noodles move. Shouldn't expect anything but the worst."}
{"text":"This location has a habit of locking the doors at 8:45 while customers are walking up. I used to eat here 4 or 5 times a week. I will not be doing that in the future. I've contacted their franchisee as well."}
{"text":"Your classic noodle place - everything from Asian style pad Thais to classic Mac and cheese (which, I might say, is a great place to start if you're uncertain). My only gripe with this place is that they never bring them out warm enough- pasta and sauce is obviously premade and they throw veggies and meat / tofu in a pan if requested. But they never are warm when they get to your table!   I'm just so glad they finally decided to open up AFTER I moved away from college ... humpf."}
{"text":"Marlena was FAB!  I have passed this place so many times in various cities due to the name of the restaurant & my food allergies, silly me!   The menu is Vegan unless you add the meat & cheese toppings & that was my initiation into the N&C fan club.   Marlena, her inviting personality & her 'knows her stuff' persona, made me & my Godmother feel very welcomed.   I gestured for another customer to go ahead of me since I was still gazing in a foodie crush. & when I overheard him order the Japanese Pan Noodles, I had to ask him of his opinion. He stated this dish was his favorite, & with Marlena breaking down some further nutritional information for me & I was hooked.   In my abnormal 10 minute Q&A & ordering process, I got to meet the General Manager Freddie who is from MoCo & just relocated to this location...small world & divine noodle intervention.   To stay on course, I selected the Japanese Pan that comes with caramelized udon noodles in a very savory/sweet soy sauce, broccoli, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, black sesame seeds & cilantro, I negated the Asian sprouts...IT WAS FANTASTIC!  In addition the futuristic soda machine, they offer a plethora of bottle drinks, Buff Bowls, Salads, Kid's Meals (very fun & creative), Soups, Sharable's, Sandwiches, wine & beer...yes, one glass of Cab paired my enormous bowl of delight perfectly.   They cook with an open kitchen, which this location was crystal clean, the menu has a strong Gluten Free presence, a full Ingredient List & I mean a very precise description of every item on their menu. & listen, when they offer Vegetable Broth it's straight VEGGIE.    Noodles & Company is simply a by design culinary creation of endless unleavened dough possibilities...I'm so ecstatic I am better late than never.   Marlena, I hope your growth within the company brings you to the DMV once in a while, your customer service is bar none exceptional!"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted.  Half of me says \"Meh. I've experience better\" and half of me says \"a-okay.\"  Let me break this down for you....  When you have a flexible schedule and can travel anywhere in the city, pass this sucker by.  There's so many other fabulous non-chain restaurants in the Burgh to try out!  On the flip side, I understand working downtown sometimes the options get slim or stale.  Let's face it, downtown is only so big folks.  For a downtown office worker, this place is \"a-okey.\"    I tried the Japanese Pan Noodles.  I liked that I could order wheat noodles.  I liked that there was broccoli, carrots and sprouts in it.  That's where it ended.  It was kinda bland and forgettable.  Would it suffice for a fast lunchtime meal, yes.  What I was amazed by...the fancy schmancy pop machine.  It's completely digital and you're able to choose from every coke product imaginable.  When I picked coke zero, I was expecting the choice of, well, coke zero.  Instead, Not only was I able to get normal coke zero, I could get cherry vanilla, raspberry, lemon, lime and a couple other choices.  I assume they add syrup to those choices...but it was pretty cool.  I love when technology and food combine!  Heck, I'd come here JUST to grab a pop instead of 7-11.    There's supposed to be beer, which was advertised on the menu and on the front door, but it's not there yet.  I'd be interested to see what they carried because it looked like there's no tap, so I assume just bottles.  I'd like to see a fancy machine like the Coke machine with alcohol!  Wouldn't THAT be grand!?"}
{"text":"First time here, very good food and a casual atmosphere . I'll come back. The Mac n cheese is very good"}
{"text":"Had the Japanese Pan Noodles. Very dry, lack of sauce or distinct flavor. Pieces of broccoli were microscopic. Price wasn't too bad but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am so glad there is finally a noodles & co in AZ! I've been to locations in NJ & CO and I'm obsessed! $6 buys me a small pasta and side soup with is a perfect portion for me. I highly recommend the Alfredo, penne rosa, and tomato basil soup!"}
{"text":"So we got a free office lunch after one of the sales guys dropped his card in the bowl by the register. We got the works for lunch, Soup, Salad, Noodles, Desert. The food was good but i thought it was rather bland and most of it tasted the same. They brought out a order of flat bread and pot stickers for apps. I didnt get to try the flat bread but the pot stickers were not very good. I took one bite and set it to the side, no flavor at all and very doughy. I ordered the Curry soup and it was very thin and cool to the tong not what i was looking for on a cold day so i took a pass after a few sips. Next came the fruit and Spinach salad which was pretty good it had lots of toppings, no strawberries like in the picture but had apples and blue cheese and other tasty bites, i liked this the best. Next up was the Japanese Pan Noodles, again not very hot but i was hungry and so i ate about half, it was lacking flavor and was a bit oily, i added some Sriracha but it just made it spicy not great. Next they brought out a basket of deserts, i am not a big sugar person so i tried a 1/2 of a.snickerdoodle, again not really worth it."}
{"text":"Great concept, terrible food. Even Hamburger Helper is better than the steak stroganoff here. Other beef stroganoffs that are better than Noodles & Company: Lean Cuisine, Michelina's frozen dinners and I'm sure if I found some beef stroganoff in the street, it would be exponentially better than what I just ate."}
{"text":"Good affordable food.  Has a variety of noodle dishes available so anyone you go with should be happy. I love the pad Thai noodles and the buffalo chicken mac n cheese.  Lots of seating and is a good location - good for a quick meal before going to a show or event on state street."}
{"text":"Pretty good, been here twice  Noodles were good  Flatbread was not worth the money :)"}
{"text":"Food was good. Pathetic Service. They ran out of serving bowls and served in takeaway boxes. Moreover, they didn't even care to clean the tables covered in used bowls even after requesting them multiple times. This was my first visit to the city and had a really bad experience at this place."}
{"text":"Restaurant review How can a chain restaurant be so different from the rest. I recently got my free birthday meal coupon from Noodles and Company. I was looking forward to the beef stroganoff which use to be my favorite many many years ago. Luckily school is out so we got parking on the same street as the restaurant. Ordering was simple, you pick and chose from a picture menu. Many of the dishes require you to pay more for protein, some are built into the cost. The food came rather quickly. I agree with Yelp reviewer Xi S., portions are significantly smaller than I remember. I don't know if NC removed another size to the dish, but this was a lot smaller than I remember. The noodles were slightly under cook and the lack of sauce was rather troubling as many of my bites were just plain noodles. Also the employees do not appear that they want to be working here at all. Now that I have tried it, I think I will pass the next time I get an email coupon....  Pros: Lots of different asian inspired noodle dishes, quick  Cons: small portion size, disinterested employees, under cooked noodle and lack of sauce  Hidden deals: 1. Use the Hooked app which gives you additional savings. Dinner time savings was 2 dollar off an entree 2. Sign up for the email club for a free pasta on your birthday  Health code rating: B http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=781"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week or so ... the first time was more or less OK, this time was not. First trip, I got the Alfredo Montamore, and it was so-so. Good pasta, very thin sauce but good flavor, lots of tomatoes, sparse spinach.  This time, I got the Mac & cheese and my husband got the Japanese noodles. The flavors were decent, but the pasta in both dishes was seriously undercooked. So undercooked, in fact, that we gave up after a few bites and went elsewhere for lunch. Very nice staff, but I don't think I'll be back a 3rd time."}
{"text":"The noodle & company is my go to place for takeout food. I always order the Alfredo MontAmore and I have never been disappointed. The Parmesan chicken is absolutely delicious! The chicken is always super tender and flavorful. When I went to pick up my order today I asked if they have a rewards program. The lady at the cashier told me they don't and I responded that I eat here way too much so I figured I would ask. She then offered me free dessert and a free fountain drink to thank me for my business. I was really impressed with the great customer service. I didn't expect to get anything free when I asked but it was nice to show they will go above and beyond for loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Love the place. Staff is very friendly ,good prices and very clean. Much better alternative to any of the fast food places."}
{"text":"The Japanese Pan noodles(udan) are really good.  For noodles, though, the prices are higher than you may want. But if you are craving noodles...go for it."}
{"text":"Portions are very misleading, the small to go is smaller than the in store option. Got my order completely wrong. Not worth a revisit."}
{"text":"This place is great for college students on a budget. Their portions are generous and their prices are pretty reasonable. My only complaint is that their consistency is a bit off, but it isn't extreme enough for me to not come back to this place weekly. I highly recommend the Pad Thai, Macaroni and Cheese, Penne Rosa, and Whole Grain Tuscan Fresca. Steer clear of the cheesy garlic bread."}
{"text":"It's pretty good but it's not spectacular or anything. I'd come back again. The Thai curry is good but the pad Thai really doesn't taste like pad Thai. If you're a fan of pad Thai from Thai restaurants, then don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Takes 20 min to get food during lunch and order is wrong. I think I'll try nothing but noodles instead next time. Service is good though."}
{"text":"I love Noodles and Co! I've never had any disappointments with them. You can customize your food, they have low calorie options and even offer alcohol. The staff and management are wonderful and very friendly!"}
{"text":"In a town with a surprising amount of Asian food, it's best to avoid Noodle's take on Thai and Japanese cuisine.  Stick to the simple things like the Mac & Cheese and you'll be much better off."}
{"text":"I normally like Noodles.  It's a good go-to when you're in a hurry.  This is the WORST Noodles I have ever been to.  My husband and I got take out.  Our food was ready quickly, but they messed up our order.  The staff was very nice about fixing the mistake quickly.  The actual restaurant looked very nice, but the food left something to be desired.  I ordered a dish that I have enjoyed before at other Noodles locations.  The sauce lacked flavor, the vegetables were sparse and cut into large chunks, and the chicken was overly salty with the breading falling off.  I will definitely be finding a different Noodles location from now on."}
{"text":"Run away! Now!   We walked in since we have had good experiences with this chain in New York. But this place was horrible. We noticed that the eating area had litter all around after placing our order. The potstickers were flat and cold. The Mac and cheese was so so and we couldn't finish it. The only thing we managed to finish (since we were hungry) was the chicken Cesar salad.   I checked into Yelp and found people who had posted pics of their food with pubic hair in it. I almost threw up the little food that I had managed to eat."}
{"text":"Can second the fact that they directly touch foods with bare hands. Saw them prepare salads by grabbing every ingredient workout gloves, wiping hands on apron, then continuing to touch food. Thankfully i got a noodle bowl.   Noodle bowl portion for a regular is extremely stingy and small. And they put small orders and regular both in the small bowls. Three bites of noodles and i was literally out of noodles. There are more noodles in a 10 cent pack of ramen than in the regular bowl size. Sad.   Noodle bowls for $5.79 regular do not come with meat. Meat is additional $2.79. Large drink is $2.19. Prepare to pay over $10 if you want regular bowl, meat, large drink.  The only bowl i saw come in large was the hot pot which is almost $9.   Seating extremely limited. Tables do move duo you can put tables together.   Self serve fountain drink is the all in one coke system, so even if you get regular coke, it is tainted in flavor from the flavor options.   There are Three registers, but the cashier decided to go to the far right one still the line had to back up for her. Stupid. Use the far left register to allow the line to good more people inside.  I may try this once more.  I May not. Such a disappointment in what could have been a great idea. But small portions, lack of Seating, higher prices for a minimal meal make it lose it's lackluster theoretical greatness."}
{"text":"We went to Noodles on a soft opening night at this location and they were all very nice and know a lot about the menu items and the service and taste of the food was awesome. I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered online for in-store pickup. Got the order home and one of the meals (pasta fresca) was missing almost all the ingredients - no fresca sauce (just oily noodles), no spinach and no tomatoes. This is the third time this location has messed up our order. They have the worst employees too - the night prior we drove past to check their Sunday hours. All the kid employees glared at us and started pointing and laughing from inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly and helpful staff! Food is fantastic! Excellent variety of noodles that you can customize."}
{"text":"great place to stop real quick and eat there macaroni and cheese its to die for cheesy gooey goodness they give you the perfect amount and perfect temperature so that you can eat it on the spot love this place"}
{"text":"Overall Impression: An \"okay\" noodle-ry for a quick lunch in Market Square that offers nothing to write home about--basically the Subway of Pasta. You're excited about it because you haven't had it in awhile, then you're sad after you eat it.  The Food: This food just doesn't do it for me. It doesn't hit my Italian cravings or my Thai cravings. It always falls extremely short of my expectations, mainly because they label themselves as niche-style noodle place. When a restaurant wants to be known for something very specific I generally think it will be above average--but I was wrong. Even though their dishes LOOK good, they are generally bland and lack any depth of flavor even though they market them as very diverse flavors (Asian, Italian, southern, etc.). My usual go-to here is the small-portion Pad Thai + protein (I picked sautéed shrimp). The rice noodles stuck together and were lacking sauce. The dish was mostly noodle with little toppings-- the scrambled eggs, cabbages, Asian sprouts, and green onions were all scarce. I had 4 pieces of *sautéed* shrimp that didn't taste sautéed at all, they were very chewy and dry. The Thai Chicken Soup saved the day flavor-wise (coconut curry is hard to mess up) but was missing something very important--the chicken. I scooped my spoon through it and didn't find one hint of protein, just the lemongrass, online, cabbage, and carrots, and pepper. They must have ladled it from the top. Besides the obvious lack of quality in the food, the team there has extreme difficultly adhering to special dietary needs. You'll see this backed up in other reviews here and I've seen personally where they just miss the bar. You'll clearly omit something in an order and because they're moving so quickly they stop paying attention to the little add-ons. My coworker doesn't eat meat or dairy and they've wrecked her order every time we've gone--so it's definitely not the place if you need a special version of something. They just get into this mode where they stop reading the tickets the entire way.  The Restaurant: I went to college downtown, and I've visited this place at least 10 times within that timeframe. I remember their menu being more robust and diverse; since then they have tapered down on the amount of noodle options and other dishes. I specifically remember a spicy chicken caesar wrap that's no longer available, and I thought that was better than the majority of their noodle dishes. The best thing about this location is there dedication to quick service. I placed an order online from my office and could pick it up 8 minutes later. I arrived at the location, walked into the dining room, and they had all mobile orders waiting on a shelf with your tag and ticket. You literally have to speak to no one--you just walk in, grab your bag (and check it because of how often they screw up), and go! It's one of the most hassle-free online pickups I've done down here next to Moe's Southwest Grill. Even though they have an iffy reputation, the place is usually packed, and the tables frequently in need of cleaning, which doesn't happen as often as it should. I would highly recommend the online order to take back to the office instead, as it's much quicker. The staff is neither unfriendly or friendly, just hyper-focused on filling bag after bag. I did have all of my eating utensils and napkins, but still check your bag before you leave.  TL;DR: This place is great if you're in a pinch because of their fast service, but I honestly don't know why I keep going here expecting something different or better with their food, because I end my meal disappointed every. single. time. There's better fish in the sea of Market Square."}
{"text":"Awesome location, clean and the workers are extra pleasant. Good idea to have dinner if you don't eat meat or do. I came in 10min before closing and they offered me the opportunity to sit in and eat. Talk about great customer service"}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights   1) lots of gluten free options 2) quick  Noodles and Company may not come to mind immediately when you are looking for a fast gluten free lunch or dinner....well it should! Noodles and Co. Offers rice noodles    And gluten free corn pasta. Oh the possibilities! You can substitute most of the regular dishes with the rice noodles or g free pasta (not the macaroni and cheese though as the sauce has gluten). The pad thai is gluten free as is so you don't even need to make substitutions. This location has one of those awesome soda machines with every coke product flavor you can dream of  Bring on the diet cherry coke!  The East Towne location service was really friendly, however there were tons of dirty tables. I understand not cleaning them as quickly when you are slow (I was there for dinner around 8:30pm on a week night) but 7-8 dirty tables with nobody walking around to clean them is kind of gross as the location is small.   Overall not a bad place for a quick lunch or dinner with plenty of gluten free options."}
{"text":"First impression of this place is, I LOVE IT!  It's basically a chipotle concept store (fresh ingredients, etc.) with noodles!  I went today with my HS bestie, and we both loved it.  We ordered the same thing -  Indonesian Peanut Saute: Spicy peanut sauce and rice noodle stir-fry, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, Asian sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and lime.  As in fresh lime wedged, served with your platter - i loved that added touch.  The dish itself tasted authentic, fresh, and flavorful.  It was studded with the steamed veggies that made the meal very hearty.  My only grip was the chicken (which you add separately to the bowl, they have other options such as tofu, shrimp, and beef - i think)  wasn't as flavorful as the noodles, as in it needed salt!  If this was a little bit better, I would have given noodles & co. a 5 star rating.  They serve all different types of noodle bowls + sandwiches.  Ranging from Asian to American flavors, so it will appease anybody's palate.  The decor is modern-chic.  The service was stellar, for what is basically a fast food joint.  You should definitely give this place a try - I loved it!"}
{"text":"Even though this is a franchise it feels pretty intimate. This is my new favorite spot to grab something quick to eat in Gastonia. They have excellent service. If you are military or police/fire and have your badge/ ID they will give you a discount. Good place to try."}
{"text":"My co-workers order lunch from Noodles & Company often. They really like it. Sorry, but I don't agree.   Thus far, I've sampled the thai noodles and the truffle macaroni and cheese. One word describes both dishes: BLAND.   Thai food should never be boring, and the curry lacked spice completely. The macaroni and cheese surprisingly lacked flavor for how many ingredients it contained. I ended up shaking some hot sauce over it.   Succinctly, this chain charges a bit too much for bland lunches."}
{"text":"Update: Site is still janky but this location picked up their delivery game 200%. Walk in grab yo stuff, move on with your life. How it ought to be. I have zero issues with them now. Decent lunch grub if you're down for that gluten hittah ... Good for them hangover type days if you know what I'm speaking on. Gang."}
{"text":"I had never been here wanted to try it since it isn't too far from my job. I ordered the Japanese pan noodles with steak. It seemed to take a little long.. I waited about 15 minutes for my food good thing I get a hour lunch. I had the small bowl which is plenty, so good portion sized. My cashier was nice, they definitely seemed busy. I paid a little over 11 bucks for my bowl and a sparkling water. The food was just ok... I don't think I'd go back only because when I looked at the menu it wasn't exactly what I had thought it would be, I guess I imagined it to be more of an Asian kind of place but they do speghatti and butter noodles etc and that's not really my thing."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and tried the Japanese Pan Noodles. It was a decent meal. I love any kind of noodles so of course it was right up my alley but I not love that the main vegetable was carrots and not the broccoli and bean sprouts that were pictured. I also love Japanese food but usually the flavors are so mild and clean but this bowl tasted like it had too much seasoning. How can something have too much flavor you ask? Well, it usually involves MSG. According to their website they don't use any artificial ingredients so I am assuming it was msg free but I found that my meal had a shocking 2,010 MG OF SODIUM. The calorie count was 710 calories not including the steak I added so I can only assume the actual calories was over 1,000 (that info was not readily available on the website).  I am giving them an extra star because the place was clean and the staff was friendly. I do see they have other options with more vegetables and no pasta or noodles so I will probably give them another try. Just don't be fooled into thinking this place has healthy food just because they use hormone free meat."}
{"text":"food was pretty good, but the restaurant is filthy. i went in around 8, it was slow, and every single table was dirty. there was trash all over the floor, and all of the employees were standing behind the counter talking/ laughing. makes me reluctant to go back."}
{"text":"We've been to Noodles a number of times and this location never disappoints.  Our food was fresh and tasty!  Our wait was less than 5 minutes.  The staff were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I love the food at Noodles. Always delicious, portions are faily large, selection is great. The service leaves a bit to be desired. The last time I was in, there were approximately three occupied tables in the dining room. Every single other table, aside from one small 2 seat table had dishes and food left on them waiting to bussed. We had to ask to have a table cleared for us before we could sit down. Maybe if the restaurant had been busy at the time, it would be a bit more understandable, but the place was dead."}
{"text":"The food was probably a 3.5/5... very standard Noodles&Company, but a tad on the salty side. However, there was plentiful seating, a clean eating space, and 5/5 service! The employee who took my order was super friendly and a manager asked me how my food was. Overall a great experience and I'd recommend it to others, but personally I'm just not a big fan of the types of pasta Noodles and Company offers."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity and time to drop by today for lunch and the staff was terrific.  One of the managers recognized me and had my favorite salad, Med Salad with Grilled Chicken, ready by the time I paid.  They do a great job, food is fresh and they have been improving since opening.    This is my #1 place TO GO for a fast salad as I know in advance it will be done correct, and taste the same."}
{"text":"Always a clean location. Although it stays pretty busy during peak times there is always parking available nearby and a table at which to eat your delicious meal. I'm a fan of the Pesto Cavatappi with Parmesan Crusted Chicken, the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese, and of course, all the Izzy drinks!   The service is pretty quick and the staff has always been friendly to me. My only complaint is the amount of moms with kids that show up. It's a great family spot if that's what you are looking for...me, not so much. It forces me to watch my language and topic of conversation with can be somewhat annoying when you just want to relax for lunch."}
{"text":"I love carbs and I love pasta, so Noodles & Co is a place that I really want to like. Each of the handful of times I've gone, I end up finding myself thinking that I WANT to enjoy the food more than I actually do.   I went to the soft opening of this location, and found myself thinking the same thing...again. Even my friend said the same.   There's nothing to not like, per se. It's very clean, the look and feel is very modern, the staff is friendly, yet I leave each time feeling that something is amiss.  There's just something lackluster about the food; I've made much more satisfying pasta and noodle dishes in my own kitchen.   If I'm starving and Noodles & Co is the only nearby option, I'll go. Otherwise, I'll probably choose something else from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first visit tonight.  Had the Pad Thai with Tofu.   Unlike another reviewer I was very pleased with this dish.   It was piping hot and delicious.   At the end of the meal I thought I would take something home for my wife and son to share.   I ordered the Mac & Cheese since it seemed like a safe bet and they claim it is their top seller.   There is no way the dish I brought home is the same as what they claim is a customer favorite.  What I got tasted like buttered noodles with no real trace of cheese.   I'll probably try this location again but it seems like the items are going to be hit or miss."}
{"text":"I'm just going to jump right to it. We paid $45 for myself, my husband and my 14 year old.   We got 2 lg pasta dishes and a small. All were Terrible and cold.   We order a side of potstickers which were hot in spots and ice cold in others. Not sure how that happens but that's when I got nervous. Being pregnant the thought of food poising is always in the back of my mind.   The cheesy bread looked like cheesy bread that lacked cheese that had been sitting on your counter all night. Dry and not hot.   We asked for our money back on the pot stickers and we got replacements to go instead. Wow, thanks...just what I wanted food to go?!?!   Just horrible! Probably the worst place I have ever eaten. I want my $45 back please!"}
{"text":"Before I ever went in to noodles I was like \"oh yeah, I get it, it's a little healthier than like chipotle or antonio's, and it has lots of noodle dishes, sounds like a good idea to me.\"  Then I actually went for lunch one time.  There was nothing on the menu that looked at all appealing (too much broccoli in everything; I'm a hater,) so I ordered the mac 'n cheese because it was the least healthy looking option and therefore had the best chance of being tasty.  I got it with \"steak\" which cost like an extra $10 or some shit.  It was so expensive!    My macaroni and cheese came out, and it was so bland I put sriracha in it.  The \"steak\" was not worth the ridiculous $10, and was barely identifiable as any particular type of meat.  It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it has air conditioning and is clean."}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY from start to finish. Staff was very kind. Food was very good. The chicken soup was on point. If it's your first time they give you a free cookie which was amazing as well.   I'd recommend to everyone!  Go check it out. I'd drive out of my way for it."}
