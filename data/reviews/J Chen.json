{"text":"I love this place, great service and amazingly delicious Chinese food. The sweet n sour chicken is my favorite. I've never had it better and I've eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants. I also love the vegetable fried rice, lemon chicken, and wonton soup. I've seen reviews that are unfavorable and to each his own but, really? I don't know what the hell they're talking about. This place rocks and does so consistently."}
{"text":"Been here many times - its a quick stop for chinese and close to home.  All the basics and done to a decent level until today.  Not sure if the cook was away but all the food was nuked - peppers still chilled and the Gen Tsao's was soggy.  Should have realized something was up when quoted 10 mins for pick-up.
Oh well, will give them another go soon as convenient but if this happens again will go the extra 2 miles (from home) to Jade Palace - a 5 star emporium"}
{"text":"Short and sweet, the food was AWESOME and the management was even better. You know it's good Chinese food, when the cook is Chinese, just say'n"}
{"text":"Chicago snowbird turned us on to this restaurant in our own town.  We did takeout and it was great.  Excellent variety on the menu.

I had sweet and sour shrimp with pork fried rice.  My husband had Szechwan Beef (he likes spicy food, so he even ordered more hot stuff on the side.)  All was fresh and tasty.

We will put this on our list of regular dining favorites."}
{"text":"I went to j Chen tonight and we ordered pad tai, chow mein, and honey garlic chicken. The pad tai was flavorless and stuck together in one big lump. Honey garlic chicken was also flavorless. It tasted like a thick flour paste. The chow mein was also cold and flavorless. Unfortunately we did take out so we could send it back."}
{"text":"First visit, ordered orange beef . Meet was fatty, indicating low quality and lacked crispiness. Don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER!!! When you walk in you see a Buddha, fish, and a very pretty fountain. You sit down in a darkish room and your server will be right with you. In this family friendly environment, the lady at the front desk is so sweet and kind. She will always make you smile. I recommend the pork fried rice. It taste like heaven. Definitely coming here a lot."}
{"text":"It's the best in the area! I always get takeout, the order is always right and the food is really good. It's for sure worth a try."}
{"text":"Food...outstanding Green Curry Chicken, Oustanding!!! Their crab ragoon is unmatched, simply delicious. I am always happy to help my wife finish her meal, and always pleased with w/e she orders.

Ambiance...I have only eaten inside once but it was clean and spacious enough.

Staff...very friendly. We get take-out maybe once a month and they are always friendly.

Verdict...definitely worth a try. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is it can get quite pricey."}
{"text":"My wife & I ate there last night.  It was great!  We had the crab puffs for an appetizer.  There were 8 of them with a tasty filling and lighter/crispier than usual wrappers.  My wife had sweet & sour shrimp.  Larger than normal shrimps with a light batter and fresh, not overcooked vegetables.  The red sauce was served on the side whcih meant you can control how much you use instead of drowning everything in sauce.  Very good - you can actually taste the shrimp.  I had the moo shu pork.  Again, very well done.  The sauce was  on the side again (other than what was used to cook the dish).  Service was quick and very pleasant.  Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"The food at J Chen is good....but the owner/hostess is a very unpleasant woman.  She is downright rude and unfriendly.  She will be the reason I will stop going back and stop recommending this restaurant to other people."}
{"text":"Me and my family have gone there before and loved it the food, service, and price was good. 

Then for my sisters birthday party(10/17/2014), we went there with our extended family. The service was absolutely awful. They brought out our food about an hour after we finally got our order in.  My mom had to clean our mess. And then came the cake, we brought our own cake but we had to wait to get our lighter, clean platers, etc.

When my mom spoke to the owner he would not listen to her and acted like everything was fine until my mom yelled at him, and then he said since we went there so often and had such a large party he gave us the awful service.

It was my sister's first time there and they we not polite.

Not only was the service awful but it also probably ruined my sister's birthday."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal here yet despite other reports. Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"thought I would treat myself for lunch.  I have eaten here before but it's been awhile.  I ordered the pad thai.  Not only was it expensive, but it was the worst pad thai I have ever eaten!  There were only 2 shrimp ($12?)..and they were not totally cooked. Some of the chicken was rubbery.  i will never order this again!  what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Yikes I have visited this place 3-4 times in hope of finding a dish that I will like, but I am very disappointed. Its neither authentic nor fusion nor tasty chinese/thai food. The chicken in most dishes tastes like it has been inserted in after the main ingredients were cooked, sort of bland. The ambiance seemed all right, but the food is challenging."}
{"text":"We usually go for lunch and it's pretty good! But this time we went for dinner and we were horrified. The hot and sour soup was gross and had rubbery shrimp in it. Then I had rubbery BBQ pork and vegetables, which was supposed to be chicken. As I exited the bathrooms, our server was going in to clean it! That was it for me. The owner was more into watching tv than taking care of the guests. They were cleaning the hoods in the kitchen, so all you could smell was ammonia while it was 127 degrees in there. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Really good food, very nice interior, great lunch specials, Service is ok. The best egg roll Ive ever had! (And I hate egg rolls)"}
{"text":"I placed an order for takeout-- Thai duck was VERY tough and grisly, shrimp with vegetables bland, and sweet and sour chicken unremarkable in all respects.  The order was ready on time, but in my opinion, I will go elsewhere and wait an extra 15 min's for food that is of a better quality."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. We have been ordering take-out here for four years. The food was always pretty good. Unfortunately, I tried to order something new and realized it was something I could not even begin to eat. I walked back in to order something different and even offered to pay for it. The woman screamed at me in front of other customers and tried to make me feel terrible for returning a dish that they had made. I have never been so humiliated for something that was so simple to fix. Will NEVER return!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. I don't know what happened. The meat they use now absolutely disgusting. The steak they choose to use is so thin and cheap it turns into a flimsy slimy mess. So disappointed. I used to come here all the time and it's really gone downhill. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"The absolute worst!  100% garbage.  I ordered mushy pork.  Guess what?  No pork.  I called to let them know and I got yelled at!  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"A few days ago we ordered for pick-up. The food was quick and ready when we arrived 10 minutes after the call. One thing that I recognized while walking in is a bad smell that stands in the room. I looked around and quickly realized that there are quit a few water features in the the place. That odor fit foul water so I am 99% sure the fountains need to be cleaned asap. 
The entree items we order was soft noodles with chicken and double fried noodles with beef. While the double fried was good but lacked meat in comparison to the size of the dish. The soft noodles were mediocre and also seemingly shortened on protein. The worst was the wonton appetizer we ordered. Looks like the must ran out of filling because the wonton wraps had no filling what so ever in it. Basically that is fraud for a $6 appetizer.
Working in the industry for many years I will not ever order or go dinning at this place ever again. If the decoration lacks cleanness and they knowingly let me pay for an item that is not as I order it, the place will properly lack in even more professionalism. I bet if I walk in the kitchen it would need updates and cleaning. So safe your hard earned money and your time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Order takeout and it'll be ready in less than 10 minutes.  This place is extremely consistent and the staff is very friendly.  What more do you want from your local Chinese Take Out?"}
{"text":"We usually order carry out for a quick good meal!  But last night the food was awful not only was it wasted calories and money, it tasted like a piece of paper.  The Thai noodles were the ugliest pale pink color with no species or flavor. The Shrimp fried rice had no description whatsoever, and the shrimp smelled.  So no dinner for us!  It will take a lot for us to even consider calling for take out again."}
{"text":"Sub-mediocre to very underwhelming.  In every single aspect. Hot & sour soup was neither.  Despite the fact it was completely dead inside, the service was lacking..go to a $7 fast oriental take out or \"cook\" top ramen instead.  Some things deserve a second chance but this is clearly and undeniably not one of them."}
{"text":"We ordered hot and sour soup, barbeque spare ribs and eggplant with shrimp.  The hot & sour soup was neither hot nor sour.  The spare ribs were tough and the main dish had a total of five baby shrimp (which were added to the $8.95 eggplant dish for $5 extra).  All and all, this meal wasn't worth $2.90 much less the $29 we paid.   We were ripped off."}
{"text":"I thought it would be nice to get Asian food and bring it home to me and my girlfriend to have for a nice night. I got the shrimp with lobster sauce and my girlfriend got the chow mein soft noodle with veggies.  The food was average but it hit the spot.  After about an hour of eating I started to feel very bloated. Two hours after that would start a terrible night of diarrhea and throwing up. I have never been this sick from eating out and food poisoning.  I was getting the chills and horrible stomach pains along with repeated trips to the bathroom all night.  I felt so miserable I had to stay home from work so it not only made me sick, it took away a days pay for me.  You may not have the same experience as me but for this only being the second time eating here and to have this happen I will never be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Attended lunch with a gal pal and it was ik. Returned with husband for dinner and was disappointed.  Kung Pao just didn't have flavor nor spice.  Couldn't get hubby back of I tried."}
{"text":"OMG ~ What a great lunch we had at J Chen's Chinese & Thai Cuisine. Our appetizer was called Sugar Cane Shrimp (bottom left), and man'O'man was it good. Our 2 lunch specials were only $6.75 each. They were Szechwan Chicken (left), and General Tsao's Chicken (right). Both came with a choice of rice, 2 wontons, a egg roll, & egg drop soup. Great place for your Asian fix ! ( located on the SW corner of Tatum & Cave Creek Rd. )"}
{"text":"I like the food here, and the service is always great.  They Thai menu is great and the Lemon Chicken is really good as well.  If you like Tom kha gai, try it here!"}
{"text":"got the meat wontons...great taste but a minuscule amount of meat.  the fried rice with pork was great, however, the scallop dish was ok but wouldn't order again  the scallops just weren't think enough but maybe that's the way they cook the dish in general.  the ambience was very nice.  nice bar setting"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area but in the last few months it's gone down hill fast. 

First they raised their prices, which is fine, but quality took a dive. My Almond Chicken was 50% celery. Egg rolls are now mush rolls. And service has gotten bad as well. Sometimes it's little things like ordering one soup and getting home to find another. Or not getting the correct change back from your payment. 

If there is a real J. Chen out there, do something and fix your place. You may not think customers notice the changes, but we do."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a nice surprise.  We have been looking for good Chinese in North Scottsdale for some time.  We happened upon J Chen yesterday and decided to give it a try.  The decor is a bit tiki hut meets Chinese restaurant meets collectibles but in a good way.  The restaurant is casual, warm and inviting.  The food was great.  We had Happy Family and Beef Chow Fun.  The sauces were not too heavy, the vegetables were cooked but not mushy and they had a good amount of meat in both dishes.  I wish they had not put the celery in the Happy Family but what can you say.  The food was good enough that I went back the next day and got an order of Mu Shu Pork to go.  The portions are large. The service is helpful and efficient.  Without a doubt this will become a weekly stop on our restaurant rounds."}
{"text":"I have visited J Chen more than a dozen times, mostly take-out. I've always enjoyed the food. The Szechuan Beef is particularly good. Big portions, too."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience here with take-out and I think it will be my last. Ordered Kung Pao chicken and it looks more like celery stew. Celery is already the worst \"filler\" used in Chinese food, but I have never seen so much of it used in a single dish. Just take a look at the pic. If there was no celery in there, it would probably be a quarter full. Not the greatest quality chicken either; kinda chewy."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great for quick service or hanging out and enjoying the atmosphere, lovely food at reasonable prices and outstanding, friendly staff. The place is so clean you could eat off the floors..."}
{"text":"Working in the area I happened by J Chen's. I ordered the Pad Penang with chicken because I wanted to try something new. It was fantastic. This place is way across town from where I live but will return when I can. The staff was very friendly and I enjoyed talking with them."}
{"text":"The ladies that helped us were very nice and attentive granted we were the only people in the joint. The food overall was ok. My friend thought her pad Thai tasted a little fishy. We also ordered a panang with a medium spice and it was extremely hot. We all ordered wine and I glanced at my friends glass and there was lipstick on the glass (not from her). I pointed it out to the waitress and she got her a new glass of wine."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food I've ever had!! I seriously don't understand why the ratings are so low! We came in on a whim cause we live close and we all couldn't stop raving about how great it is! We got the egg flower soup to start, my mom and I both agreed best one we've ever tried! Super flavorful and just so yummy! We also had the squid salad, beef salad, pork chow mein, house fried rice, egg rolls, Mongolian Beef, orange chicken and Szechwan 
Chicken! EVERYTHING was phenomenal including the service! The egg flower soup and orange chicken were our absolute favorite! The orange chicken was the freshest I ever had and the breeding was so light and crispy! Definitely a must have!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times in last few months. The food is pretty good and it's a great price at lunch. We always get to go because inside is always dark and creepy and doesn't look open. I'd give it more stars if inside looked more welcoming and all the lights and water features were on, AC duct tubes weren't caked in dust. and maybe if their nasty fish tank was clean. Now that I'm thinking about all the negatives, maybe we won't come back"}
{"text":"My kids love getting takeout from J Chen. Service is VERY fast (like 10 minutes to pickup), and the food and service is consistent like mentioned by Ryan C. It's pretty dead as a restaurant goes, but I do see a lot of people coming in for take out.... I'm assuming that is where most of their business comes from.

I think the prices are a bit high for Chinese takeout - usually we get one dish for the kids to split and it runs about $11. A welcome option for Tatum Ranch, which has very slim restaurant pickings!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place in the neighborhood.  Great wor won ton soup... the mu shu is my choice.   Staff is very friendly.  Not sure what it's like to eat there, as I always get takeout.  By the way, fast on food prep.  I'll show up even on busy nights, and it's never more that 10 or 15 min to get my order."}
{"text":"I, too, lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for many years, as a previous reviewer. To compare ANY Chinese restaurant outside of SF's Chinatown or any longtime ethnic neighborhood is unfair. Those restaurants are run by the descendants of the Chinese who built the railroads for rich San Francisco industrialists. They were much like the African slaves in the South - cheap labor who were treated as chattel. Many SF restaurants are run by people who still don't speak English, often presenting menus in Chinese. Why? Because their clientele is mainly Chinese wanting authentic dishes. That point made, I've lived all over this country, from DC to SF, from LA to the ATL.  I was very disappointed when I moved to this backwards state 4 years ago. I couldn't find decent soul food or  Chinese food ANYWHERE in this tumbleweed city. I had lived within walking distance of J Chen for 2 years without even considering it an option. However, out of sheer desperation one day, I went to J Chen with several friends just to get some simple fried rice for myself. Well, my companions ordered different items as often done in Chinese restaurants. I sampled several foods and was very impressed by the freshness. Authentic Schezwan, Hunan or Manderin, as in San Francisco? No, because our tastes aren't ready for the spicy and super hot food. Most Americans are used to Cantonese or a mixture of north and south Chinese dishes, more suited to unsophisticated palates. J Chen serves these flavors up excellently. I have not eaten at another Phoenix Chinese restaurant since. My friends and family drive miles from all over the area to eat at J Chen. The owners remember their frequent customers and the dishes we prefer. In today's world with its total lack of good customer service, that treatment alone is worth the price of a ticket!!!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm don't know what's happened ... but the last two times - the meals have been just so-so.  Ordered the same things as usual - but just didn't have much flavor.  The pepper beef was forgettable.  The egg drop soup.  Flavorless.  There wasn't anything I'd return for.  I've had better there in the past (frequently).  New chef?  I don't know.  One more time - I'll not go back if it's the same."}
{"text":"Flavorless is the only way to describe it.  I'm guessing the entire dish was boiled in water.  Not one spice could be seen or tasted.  Panda Express is sadly a step up."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, nothing great, nothing terrible but $2.00 to add broccoli to a dish!!?? Come on! Did take out, it was fast and hot when I got home but $2.00 to add broccoli to dish!! Come on!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. They always accommodate my need for extra, extra spicy, and all my quirks. 

Of all the Chinese joints in town, this is one of the best."}
{"text":"My experience has been pretty positive here.  I usually order take out but have also dined in.   The food is decent and the speed is great.  I enjoy the Mongolian beef.  Some dishes are hit or miss."}
{"text":"I went to J Chen with two other friends.
Later that day after we ate, my one friend and I got very sick. We shared a plate and both ended up very sick and vomiting for hours.

I called to let them know that two of us ended up getting very sick, saying when we were there and what was ordered.

I was told that they know nothing about that and I can call the health department.

How awful is that!? Nothing like saying they were sorry that we got sick, just to call the health department.

No wonder they only get 3 stars. If they continue treating customers that way, they'll end up suffering in the long run.

I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone, there are better and cheaper places out there."}
{"text":"Our restaurant rotation has gotten to big, I think. Since we eat at 4 -5 different Chinese places we have not visited J Chen for several months. I had an odd day off and we stopped for lunch while shopping nearby. 

We arrived early and had our pick of tables, services was quick and we soon were each enjoying a lunch combination. My shrimp in lobster sauce was very good and her pan fried noodles was excellent. Comes with 2 fried won tons, egg roll and soup. 

As the lunch hour came nearer, the place got full, and the takeout business was busy. 

Went back a week later for dinner, Kung Pao Shrimp and and Walnut Chicken, also very good. 
Dinner take out was busy. 

If you are out this way shopping or live nearby this is a great place for a quick tasty meal."}
{"text":"I have been eating at jchen for years. I have always enjoyed their food. Today I picked up dinner for my family. We tried to eat the chicken chow mein and house special chicken. The chicken was not edible. It was completely rubbery. We were not able to eat any of it. I am praying we don't get sick. I called the restaurant warning them that something was wrong with the chicken. They refused to refund the chicken dishes. They insist nothing is wrong with the chicken. They lost a loyal customer in me. Like I said, we have been going there for years. The way the handled today was shameful."}
{"text":"Just mediocre. We stopped in here for a bite to eat while we were in town, we got the appetizer platter for two, which was priced higher than it should have. The quality was lacking, the beef skewers had literally no flavor, the egg rolls were decent, the shrimp was good but cold, and the wantons were severely lacking. The staff was nice. Honestly, I have had better Chinese food at fast food joints for half the cost. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food, ever.  For me this is as  good as Chinese food in both San Francisco and Vancouver, both well known Chinese enclaves.  Hats off J Chen!! Don't change.  Our standard order is Sweet and Sour Chicken sauce on the side, House Fried Rice, Sizzling Rice Shrimp, Chicken with Asparagus and Chicken Lomein - simply awesome."}
{"text":"It's hard to come by good Chinese food all the way up in Cave Creek, AZ but J Chen will satisfy your cravings. It won't blow your mind, but it's consistent and tasty. I'm a huge fried rice fan and theirs is definitely a great option.

My only recommendation is to take the food to go. I've been to the restaurant on Saturday and Sunday nights and the inside is dead. It's a large restaurant and it would just feel weird being the only ones dining in. So get the food and take it home and enjoy it while relaxing or watching a movie."}
{"text":"The food here is so good and the lady who runs it is awesome! we got the house chow mein noodles and general tso's chicken and both were very good!"}
{"text":"As true believers in supporting local business this is one business that works hard to maintain consistently high standards. Wonderful family atmosphere and friendly excellent service this little restaurant is a local treasure. It is a relaxed  home from home place serving good food. We are very happy regulars here. Delightful owners and staff. Liz and Wally are always happy campers here."}
{"text":"I had heard some good things about this place for sometime and wanted to try it out. My girlfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night. The ambience is nice when you walk in. Has a nice water feature in the middle of the restaurant. We noticed the place was absolutely dead. There was one other couple there at 8pm. We wondered why it was so empty. We would find out once we started eating. We started with the sugar cane shrimp which was pretty good. It was unique. For entrees we ordered Pad Thai and Pad Panang Neau Gai. The entrees were just horrible! I love Pad Thai and eat it any chance I get. Their version of Pad Thai had some horrific flavoring, honestly tasted like Chef Boy R De sauce was used. The Pad Panang dish was just a trainwreck! It had chicken, peppers, coconut milk sauce and some kind of spice..It seriously tasted like the smell of dish detergent. My girlfriend and I love Thai food, but this had to be one of the worst meals we both have ever had. The server didn't seem to care although she did take the trainwreck dish off our bill. We left as soon as we could. No wonder why this place was empty."}
{"text":"Not much to say, long delayed service this time even though it was slow. Forgot about us last time we went. Food is really ho hum at best, just disappointing. Pad Thai noodles are pink? No more chances."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service! Always my favorite Chinese food in north Phoenix!"}
{"text":"been there twice at night...both times there is no one there eating (hint #1).....it's just not tasty. just average. nothing special"}
{"text":"This is the most inconsistent place to eat in Phoenix.  Some dishes are alright one night, then terrible the next time, although much of the food here is premade food from a commissary kitchen, much like p.f. Chang and pei Wei.  The beer is never very cold, and no frosty mug or glass.  The service is friendly for the most part and the atmosphere is nice.  The bar is nice, but the beer too warm and the drinks too expensive.  Also, many items on the menu are very salty, so keep that in mind.  This is mostly the kind of place you pick up fast food Chinese for the kids, like a panda express, not a destination fine dining place.  After about ten trips over the last many years, we gave up and will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite. Food is fresh, bar is stocked. Device feels family owned."}
{"text":"I saw Joe Z. review and had to write.  Our family loves J chens, it is dead inside the restaurant most week nights.  They do most of their business as take out, which is always very busy every night of the week. But he was wrong about the food!  It is seriously some of the best Chinese I've had, and I've eaten in many states (including California and new york, Washington dc) and this is some of the best. Its fresh and the sauces are great.  My advice is stick with the Chinese dishes.  Joe is right the pad thai is not great.  It just simply isn't their thing.  Do the Chinese and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was actually very good. Unfortunately for my wife and I, the management is not on par with the food. The lady was rude and condescending. She screwed my order up due to a language barrier problem, then wanted to be combative about it. You screwed up lady. There is only one way to order panang chicken and that is by saying \"Panang Chicken\" please,  which is exactly what I did. Guess it is back to driving to Reign of Thai again. You don't deserve my patronage."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around 1pm.  There were a few tables filled with 2-4 guests. I was greeted and seated promptly. The atmosphere is quite pleasant and better than some I have visited. It appears they have a full bar of good quality beverages. I had hot and sour soup with my shrimp and vegetables. Food arrived quickly, hot, looked tasty and it was. The crab puffs were over cooked but all other ingredients were jus right.  Another staff member stopped by my table, and an adjacent table as I was waiting for the check.  She asked how my meal was, and f everything tasted good.  The price was reasonable too. Restroom was clean and accessible for guests with disabilities. Parking was available in the lot. I will definitely go back again and happy to give it a good review."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week and take lots of friends here for takeout as well. We almost never eat in although the place looks clean we just always do takeout. The pieces are fare and the food always comes out in 10 mins and is real good also portions are large."}
{"text":"Delicious!! My daughter and I went here for mother's day lunch. We were seated right away and several different women came to see what we wanted to drink. The normal lunch menu wasn't available because it was a holiday they said. We ordered from the dinner menu and were given large portions. The food was really good! I got the orange chicken and my daughter had broccoli and beef. We we're able to eat even half so we asked for to go boxes. They brought us each a box with extra rice in them. I had so much leftover it barely fit in the box. The restaurant was clean and nice. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to have found a quality chinese restaurant this far north. J. Chen is right down the street from my girlfriend's parents and we all had dinner here last night. The place is set up pretty nice for a little chinese restaurant in the middle of a random little shopping center. A nice water structure at the entrance. All the tables had some nice little decorations. There is a bar off to the side with a huge TV which could be a little distracting, but it had the Bulls game on, so I wouldn't complain. The only thing that is odd is the view of the front of restaurant. It's a little too open for a chinese restaurant, and I could see as the takeout people took orders, and every person who came in and out to get their food. Pretty distracting to me, but this probably isn't a problem for most people. 

J. Chen also has a pretty good looking menu, with pretty much all the standards you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant. We had the Orange Beef. It was excellent. The beef was crispy, and the sauce was very flavorful. 

Chicken and Broccoli. Light and delicious. Not over sauced. 

Sesame Chicken. Well fried and not too over sauced like most chinese places will do with this dish. Only a hint of syrup which had me craving more instead of being overindulged in sweetness. 

Kung Pow Beef. While the beef and the vegetables were cooked perfectly, I was disappointed at the lack of heat in this dish. Kung Pow is typically spicy. The menu says it's spicy. We only found two chilies in the entire plate. No heat. 

Another thing to point out is the tea. The hot tea at J. Chen has a wonderful light citrus flavor making it so much more tasteful than most places. Loved it."}
{"text":"We ordered the ribs, wings and cabbage .... Basic items that we have had before at other places. I must admit that this was really bad Chinese food.  The ribs were huge and fat, the cabbage was soggy and way over cooked to the point that the color was brownish and the wings were sort of tasty but fatty and greasy soggy. We won't be back. The bill was $25 and we wished we would have gotten Pei-Wei and I can't stand them...real Asians gotta cook and respect real Asian food!"}
{"text":"Great food, a little slow service. Pot stickers were great. I didn't try the Thai food. We will eat there again."}
{"text":"I was in the area working on a project and based on the Yelp reviews I called and ordered chicken phad thai for a lunch to go. I was shocked when I arrived and the price was $12.00, just for lunch! Then, when I got back to my job to eat I was absolutely disgusted. Phad Thai is my favorite meal, I used to live in Seattle where there is an abundance of Thai restaurants. This was THE WORST flavor I have ever had. Uneatable with rubbery chicken, dry flavorless noodles and way overpriced!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner with our whole family, three generations! We ordered the Chef's Dinner which came with nine different entree dishes chosen by the chef, so we tried things we hadn't experienced before. Fried rice, wontons, crab rangoons, choice of soup, and spring rolls were included. Great quantity and great quality!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  I have been coming here on and off for years.  Usually off.  When desperate, I'll order take-out maybe once a year, because my memory is short on how awful the food is.  Ordered shrimp in lobster sauce.  It was NOT shrimp in lobster sauce.  They have ONE sauce they use for everything - brown, with red and green peppers, and onions.  If you order kung pao, General Tso's, etc...it will ALL come with the same sauce.  I also ordered the Thai beef skewers.  Unpalatable.  They were beyond tough.  There is not a tooth in my head that could chew through it.  Nor could the dog, actually.  That says something in itself. Tasteless, as well.  Waste of $20."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! J Chen has the best Chinese food around. Me and my family have been going there for about 4 years now. We love the staff, they are like part of the family. 

While I was pregnant with my son all I wanted for a while was Chinese food. Lucky me! The staff couldn't wait to meet the baby and they are so friendly with the families that come to the restaurant. They are always so sweet to my mother and if she's not feeling well they always send her their best. 

My favorite meals are the lemon chicken and pork fried rice."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great for the price and speed of service is on point..ive only had to go food but it looks kept up well inside every time I pick up food"}
{"text":"We choose this place off of Yelp reviews and they were accurate. We found the place to be friendly, clean, inviting, reasonable at lunch, and the food was delicious. I would definitely return here again and would like to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Debacle.

We've been coming her for over 12years. It's always been a solid place to have a meal and the service was always top notch. Until tonight.

We came in at 8pm. Only 8 other people occupying two tables in the whole place. We noticed right away all the old familiar faces are gone. They must have sold the business. No problem, until we ordered.

It took about 5 minutes to get half of our entrees to the table. Cool. The other entrees never came. Never refilled our drinks. Didn't even bring rice with our entrees. Our waitress was occupying her time by casually talking to a young couple who were seated after us and had already eaten their full meal. We waited over 20min for someone to come to our table, only to ask if everything tasted ok. We explained the problem, told them we would like our bill so we could leave and that was that...or so I thought. 

We walked up to the register to pay and were told to wait and they would give us to go boxes for the food that never came. We waited ten more minutes, still nothing. I asked for my bill and was asked to pay an unreasonably inflated price which included all entrees...two of which we never received and two of which we didn't touch because we were waiting for everyone's food to arrive. We finally just gave them more than enough cash to cover the bill and just left without food. 

 But wait, there's more. As were buckling our seatbelts a waitress comes running out with a single entree in a plastic bag. She began knocking on my wife's window as were were backing up. She was loudly asking us to please take the food because she couldn't throw it away. I told her to let the kitchen staff eat it. She look really confused by that and just walked off shaking her head. Kind of sums up how we all felt, I guess. 

J Chen, we had a good run. It's not me it's you. Don't keep in touch."}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would give less than 5 stars. Food is excellent, fair prices and great service!"}
{"text":"I ordered twice cooked pork for take out and halfway through my meal I find a wire! I will never go back."}
{"text":"Moved to a new area and am in search of good everyday (pick up on the way home from work), and special occasion Chinese food. Our first stop here was in eat and nothing to write home about. But we gave it another chance and did take out and were more impressed. We have done pick up several times now and one more dine in and have only been slightly disappointed once! I think like any other place, you will love some dishes and other only so-so. So once you find what you like there, stay with it!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for about five years and have been gong to J Chen since we moved here. Although there are other options (Blowfish and Arti's) J Chen is the best. Although they won't invest in a nice TV to replace the older plasma that has \"snow\" making it hard to watch, the food is decent. I would expect more with the economy the way it is but being this North the closest alternative is about ten miles away. My biggest gripe is they claim to have pork wantons in the War Wanton Soup but if you open them up there is absolutely nothing in there. If they weren't so cheap the place would be amazing!"}
{"text":"4 stars because my food was great and my girlfriends food was great. We both liked it and had a great experience. But took home my food and the next day tried to eat it and the beef was very dark. Suspicious but tasted good. Just question why the beef was so dark"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! A really really good Chinese place to eat at! Not really popular and kind of hidden from the road to see but it is truly amazing! The portions are huge but worth all the eating and the chicken teryaki is amazing and the sauce it comes with is beyond good. i really would love to eat inside to see what it looks like and definitely to try more things here!"}
{"text":"I had been to J Chen's several times in the past and the food was petty good. I also once in a while would do carry-outs. I noticed last couple of times attending this place, food was not quite up to par and the service had deteriorated. I recently did carry-outs asking for petty much the same preparation as I always normally do with the food and received a bold and harsh time from the older woman behind the checkout counter. It was like saying to me, \"why can't you just order it as it appears on the menu\" along with a few dirty looks from her! That was it for me, I will not as a steady customer take that kind of abuse. Better to take my money elsewhere to be appreciated! Not sure if anyone else has had this problem, although they should take Mama and store her in the back room with her issues disallowing her to interact with customers.."}
{"text":"I've never been impressed by this place. I've tried a bunch I different foods, and they're all about on the same level. 
I usually do the lemon chicken (breaded fried chicken breast (?) with a syrupy lemon-ish sauce), or sweet and sour chicken (breaded fried chunks of white meat chicken along with a few chunks of pineapple and veg with a sweet red sauce). 
I was trying to cut calories a bit yesterday while still ordering out, and generally chicken teriyaki has fewer calories than the other two options (couldn't actually find nutrition info on their food. Had to guess going from other chains info). So I went with that. 
Omg. Gross. 
I'm not sure what they did to the chicken, but it was a weird texture. I usually get a fried option with the other meals, so no idea if it's usually like that before it's fried. But ew. I couldn't make it through maybe 1/3 of the meal, and had to force that much. 
Bottom line here...too much money for what you get. Absolutely no frills here. Slab of chicken, cup of sauce. Fast service for pick-up, but sub-par food.  Complete waste of money. I've had too many disappointments from this place to order any more. I'm done."}
{"text":"I have gone to J Chen a few times and every time I have had a terrible experience. The service is horrible. Everyone is very rude and unprofessional. It smells terrible in the restaurant and the menu is totally overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good. Pretty much your run of the mill Chinese food. The staff is nice and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"Got veg fried rice and wontons. I grew up with a certain kind of fried rice and I am happy that this place does it the same way. Good mix of bean sprouts, green onion, carrots, and peas. Wontons were very hard, like they had been sitting out a while, but any fried piece of dough is fine by me (I did worry about my teeth chipping though, honestly). The gentleman who took my order said there were \"very small pieces of chicken\" in the wontons, but they were so dry and hard, I could not detect anything but the wonton dough. 

Fried rice was still excellent the next day. Will definitely be back. 

I am sort of a biased reviewer when it comes to Chinese, because I only really care about the rice, wontons, and egg drop soup. Not any entree that people probably actually care about. I'm just a sides girl."}
{"text":"Great takeout choice.

On this visit eating in, great food and service. Neat small mom n pop interior. Reasonable prices, $12.50 shrimp dishes, $14.95 scallop and fish, sea bass. Crab rangoons app delicious and reasonably priced as was chicken satay app."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable pricing. The won ton  soup is always good. My wife loves their Thai selections while I gravitate to the pork dishes. The double cooked pork is good but beware it can be spicy hot.

I agree with the other reviewer the decor is a little dated but I go there for the food not an interior decorating experience."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers since they opened about 10 years ago. My husband is a fiery hot spice person, and they know how to make his favorite dishes perfect for him. My two favorite dishes there are the Walnut chicken or shrimp (and no it's not a cream sauce, it's a secret that came from Hong Kong!) and from the Thai dishes, Pineapple Fried Rice."}
