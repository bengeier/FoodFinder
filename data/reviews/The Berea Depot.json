{"text":"Wednesday night is trivia and we had the best time.  The food was really good, and our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Berea Depot this evening with my husband's family (total 4 adults and our 3 little girls), and we had a great meal.  Delicious kielbasa and pierogis, Hungarian Chicken, and crab dip - hearty Polish and Hungarian food on a wintry day - just perfect.  

And the servers/receptionist who worked this evening were adorable.  Kiersten, Stephanie, and Sadie were so fun, and attentive, and very patient with my daughters.  Kiersten was our server and was sweet and personable and really hustled (it got crowded as soon as we arrived, but the food still came out quickly, and she was always there to check in and make sure we had everything we needed).  And when my 4- and 2-year-old daughters wandered over to Sadie (at reception) to ask for milk, even though she didn't have to, Sadie went right to the kitchen and refilled their little cups, which delighted them no end.  Everyone at Berea Depot was warm and lovely.

Such a really enjoyable and pleasant evening.  Would definitely recommend, and will be back."}
{"text":"Husband is a train fanatic and we have been a few times. Last night I ordered the ceasar salad with grilled salmon. I order same at various places and this one falls to the bottom of all I have had. The small piece of salmon had no seasoning and no flavor. The ceasar dressing was not ceasar dressing. Server told me their ceasar dressing is a mix of Italian and another. Dressing looked like and tasted like Italian. Would love to return if they decide to serve their ceasar salad with ceasar dressing!  Service was very good.  Overall, a little pricey."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Shared the wedge salad and mediterranean pizza, both full of flavor! Waitress was spot on, brought water refills frequently. She knew we were splitting so she brought our salad in two separate servings. Building has lots of character and various rooms for dining. Train tracks right next to the building add to the character. 

We enjoyed our experience and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a great unique dining experience.  Set in the old Berea Union Station, the building offers many architectural sights that sets this place apart from the rest. The French onion soup is a great compliment to any order.  The Salmon BLT is amazing.  And the staff is always friendly and happy to see you."}
{"text":"The good: food was excellent, high quality, especially for the price. The clam chowder had lots of clam and good white pepper spiciness. The cheeseburger was made from high quality beef. Fries were excellent--not greasy. Pretzel-crusted wall-eye was exquisite. Also: view of the trains was really cool. 

The bad: we called for a reservation to get a table near the window so that we could see the trains. We were informed that they did not take reservations. Upon arriving, we were informed that they had already reserved the table by the window; when we told them that we'd been told they didn't take reservations, they apologized but did nothing more. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The place was empty--it was early Sunday evening--but the service was good, the prices were right, and all the TVs were on. We had salads with our meals--decent, especially the Caesar salad. My nephew liked the chicken pasta Rockefeller he had, and my peppercorn sirloin was very good, though a little salty. 

Best things: great selection of beers of all kinds, and the setting--a converted old train station--had lots of character."}
{"text":"We had the fish and chips, blackened chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. The fish was so light and didn't have a ton of grease on it as you normally find in restaurant fish. Pretty reasonable prices  as well. The set up is sweet! It's such an experience. From what I gathered, the new owners took over pretty recent so maybe cut them some slack from the other reviews. They are probably just getting settled.  They have a back train car that can be rented for private parties and it is seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"I got this alfredo with shrip there and it was soooooo good.(personal opinion the best and ive tried everywhere) I want to go back again for sure. We had a table with 7 people and everyone loved there food."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're up for some seasonal craft brews or out with the family for some food.  The station is actually a remodeled train station. You can sit out on the back patio and overlook 4 tracks with about 120 trains that come through every day. Our 3 year old son loved sitting out there. I had the panko baked Walleye for $13 and it was fresh and perfectly cooked. It came with a side of either rice or fries. The entrees in this place are great, but I think the sandwiches are their specialties. My wife had the ribs and were ok, but no where near Bubba Q's in Avon. Our waiter was awesome and even gave me a complimentary dinner salad. Would definitely come back for the old school ambiance and the selection of draft craft brews."}
{"text":"We came here because it was the only place open on Christmas day. Just looking for a quick lunch and was surprised to find a complimentary Christmas dinner! It was really good and everyone was super friendly! It is a great place anyway, but this was a surprise!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited the Berea Union Depot and we were so pleasantly surprised. The building itself is so charming, historic and very cozy and inviting. The service was really good. I had the onion soup, which is probably the best I've ever had. The spinach and artichoke appetizer was equally delicious. My husband had the bone-in ribeye and I had the horseradish salmon. I couldn't say one was better than the other as they both were so good. They offer a great selection of both beer and wines. As I said the service was great..the general manager even stopped by our table...what a delightful gal she is. I would strongly recommend the Depot to everyone. I know my husband and I will be back often."}
{"text":"Went yesterday (which was a Saturday night), and first let me say MOST of the food was delicious; there were 4 of us, ordered:

1) Northwest steak sandwich, which I asked for Mozzarella cheese instead of the Cheddar and was told they didn't have Mozzarella cheese even though their pizzas are made with fresh mozzarella - sandwich was delicious; I also substituted Brussel sprouts for French fries and somehow ended up with cold broccoli instead.  Kitchen assumed I would eat it and I did - but I thought waitress should have asked me if it was ok. 

2) Kielbasa and Pierogi entree - was delicious.

3) Chick pea pasta, was delicious, but we asked the waitress what the dressing/sauce was on the pasta and she said it was the chick peas - \"that's why it's called chick pea pasta\".  Confused because it looked clear based but I'm not a chef so who knows.  But she did confirm that the pasta was NOT made from Chick Peas - not sure what it was made from but it was gluten free.

4) fried perch.  Fish was delicious - weird side situation though, ordered Brussel sprouts, received cold broccoli, my mom HATES broccoli and was told she couldn't have a different side - What?  Especially since this dinner cost $17, and kitchen shouldn't make substitutions and just assume that customers will like them.  Anyway, about 5 minutes later, the kitchen \"found 1 more serving of Brussel sprouts leftover from yesterday\"

Apparently the mix up with the Brussel sprouts was on the waitress, she read the specials wrong, and the Brussel sprouts were the veggie from the day before.  Also was overcharged for food - so read your receipt, sandwich was marked $10 in the menu, I was charged $13.

Oh and if you go in the colder months, dress warmly - we had to wear our winter coats while eating."}
{"text":"Good onion soup, awesome pretzel in beer/cheese sauce, mustard seed topping.  Good atmosphere I will go again !"}
{"text":"First time there on Saturday afternoon, nice environment, plenty of seating. 
Bowl of French onion soup was excellent at $5.00.  
My husband's fried Perch sandwich with slaw served on Brioche bun looked great but fish was very bland and and fries were warm, not hot.
I ordered the Cobb salad with grilled chicken. Again, presentation was very nice, lots of sliced black olives, crispy crumpled bacon, diced tomatoes and sliced hard boiled egg, but the chicken was dry and tough, and blue cheese dressing was sweet, as though made with Miracle Whip rather than mayo.  I ate very little of it. 
Everything was clean, beverages refilled and waitress efficient, but I doubt we'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this restaurant even though I have driven by a ton of times. Rumor has it that it is under new ownership. My friends and I enjoyed the patio on one of the rare summer days that were left and loved the true nostalgia of being right by the tracks! You don't realize how often trains really still do run until you are in mid conversation and they are constantly going by. I loved it! 

I ordered a house salad and the crab dip. No imitation crab here! The crab dip was slightly spicy (which I liked) and was very filling for it's portion. It is served with fried pita slices. 

Another great thing about this restaurant was our waitress. She was great and she constantly was checking on us and kept our beer and water glasses filled. She had a fun personality and she told us she never wants people to feel like they have been forgotten. As a person who eats out a lot, I loved hearing that and being reassured that I had a great server."}
{"text":"Love that they offer thirsty dog raspberry ale! Food was good, not my favorite in the world. Will still return however, love the location!"}
{"text":"Just not that good. Came in for dinner with a coy one of other guys. Got a bottle of Pinot that was OK, but the wine glass was dirty. 

Ordered a Greek salad. The dressing was outstanding, and the fixins were nicely prepared. But, the gyro meat is better at Gyro George. This stuff was prepackaged and warmed on the grill. Would have been better if they used grilled chicken they could make in-house."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner yesterday at Union Depot Taverne.  First time there since the reopening after the Pufferbelly closed.  I went with high hopes and was VERY let down.  We were seated promptly because it was not busy yet.  Then we waited for what seemed to be too long for our server to acknowledge our presence.  When she finally came, we ordered our drinks and dinner since we had had plenty of time to study the menu.  We ordered burger/fries and a dinner salad each.  Our drinks finally arrived, but you could tell the server had forgotten them and only remembered as she rushed through the dining area.  She stated she would be bringing our salads shortly, and so we waited again.  Then the next thing you know, our burgers were there, brought by a different server.  When we questioned her about the lack of a salad, she said she would get our server, who did materialize with two salads in hand, saying there had been a \"miscommunication\" with the kitchen.  We declined the salads and asked that they be packed up to go since I like to eat my salad before the meal but I didn't want the burger and fries to get cold while I ate my salad.  So we took them home and I ate it at home.  Lettuce was soggy, croutons were soggy, and the bleu cheese dressing tasted like they added vinegar to it to stretch it further to lessen their cost.  
The manager (maybe owner) visited every table in the dining area where we sat except ours.  We were charged for the salads and I threw them out at home after attempting to enjoy it.  
As far as the rest of the meal, the burger was cooked medium rare as I like it but was tasteless and overpowered by the huge bun,  Fries were fair.  The brewed Iced Tea was the only redeeming thing of the experience.
I never write reviews about restaurants but I felt compelled to do so today, maybe because my anticipation was so great because I was hoping for the Pufferbelly of old.  That was not to be and we will not be returning there again."}
{"text":"This place is near and dear to the heart of my wife and I. When we were dating we came here all the time we even had our rehearsal dinner there (under the prior ownership). Since they have reopened I have been there a few time and was never blown away by the food. Last Saturday evening my wife and I went there on date night and had a really good time! The drink were cold and the bartender was attentive. The food was so-so. My wife got the San Francisco Beef sandwich. She said it was ok. I had a bite and it was pretty salty and the beef was bland. I order the Bruschetta and in all honesty the way the description read I thought it was a pasta dish....imagine my surprise when a flatbread pizza came out (the pizzas and pastas are lumped into the same category). All in all we had fun. The atmosphere is great there and they had lots of TV's to watch the game on. I will definitely be back, but the kitchen needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"Could have done alot more with the space.  Menu is very basic and screams frozen sysco food"}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday night dinner with the family after hearing that the food was pretty good. Being the first Friday of Lent, we were confined to the meatless options on the expansive menu, which were surprisingly plentiful. For an appetizer, we ordered two salads with their \"Italian Caesar\" dressing (nothing special) a bowl of the seafood bisque (-1 star for being incredibly salty) and the pub pretzels, which came with an amazing beer cheese. The fish and chips that both my mom and I ordered were very good, fish was tender inside with crisp batter on the outside, but all of this deliciousness came to an abrupt halt after discovering the massive hair sitting at the bottom of my plate. Nasty!!!!! The restaurant's decor was visually appealing and it was pretty neat to see the trains speed by while you are eating. Overall, the food was pretty good and the waitress was friendly, but I have to deduct a star for the salty bisque, and for the hair that found its way onto my plate."}
{"text":"A great patio lunch on an unseasonably warm end of September Saturday.  Enjoyed the fried pierogi with onion appetizer and the delicious short rib melt that had super tender meat with braising sauce yet the bread stayed crunchy and toasted.  Also enjoyed an occasional train passing by for fun depot ambiance. The beer selection was good and our server was fun; friendly and entertaining.  Next time I will come back with my kids since I am sure they would love to watch the trains pass by."}
{"text":"The beau & I stopped here for a quick lunch bite.  The service was a-ok which was something I was worried about considering all the Yelp reviews.  

We ordered the pretzels with \"beer\" cheese.  I wasn't a fan of the beer cheese side.  It wasn't what I was expecting, a very cream-cheese base with chunks of shallot in it.  The beau scarfed it down though, so maybe he was hungry, or he really dug it.  The pretzels were HOT when they arrived at the table, so that was nice.  We both enjoyed salads; the fresh greens and were piled high.  There are some nice beers on tap too.  

Will I go back, yeah.  If there's one complaint that I'm with on other Yelp reviewers it is that there are too many TVs in this place.  I don't mind them in the bar, but I think that TVs shouldn't be in the dining areas.  This is probably a great  bar to go to on game days."}
{"text":"This is a great place....I just had the best clam chowder and s great flat bread pizza!"}
{"text":"I was in the depot this week to check out the new ownership. Unfortunately the waitress was completely incompetent, delivering the wrong meal and forgetting another order entirely. When we asked her about it her response was 'you can't talk to me that way' as if we were rude. Trust me we weren't. Then the owner or manager came over and complained to us about bitching to the waitress. Really? This is customer service?  I'm not going back. I can understand mistakes but I don't condone rude management. I'm skipping this place in the future."}
{"text":"Love the new atmosphere & decor of this place!  The food was tasty and service was great.  I'm really glad that the restaurant/bar reopened as it's a unique gem for the area.  I'll be back again soon to try out more of the menu.

ps- would enjoy seeing more Christmas Ales available (such as thirsty dog, breckenridge, lagerheads mischief, etc)."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. The actual place is amazing. Right by the train tracks, a really old historic building, a train car to sit in or the main restaurant with just the right mix of modern - with big screen tvs and a polished bar and the old stone and wood. Plus a lot of outdoor seating. We didn't expect such a great draft beer selection either. But the food! It wasn't terrible but it wasn't very good either. The pretzel and cheese we got was not very tasty. The cheese was just tasteless.Then the pizza with brie and mushrooms was just meh, just poorly executed. I do want to go back and try some other menu items though because it's just a cool place to be. Service was great too."}
{"text":"We chose to go here because we remember it when it was the pufferbelly restaurant years ago (which was wonderful and had fresh food and specials). We enjoyed seeing the trains too- we were happy to see it open again after many years of non business/ and unsuccessful business ventures since the pufferbelly closed. 

The atmosphere is nice; they updated since the last failed venture- however we were greeted by young girls sitting at the hostess station on their cell phones texting (go figure). They sat us on the train side at a table that seats 6- that has been there for over a decade and wobbled terribly, the whole circumference of it was bowed down so everything was sliding down the table. 

The waitress was good- very sweet and we were waiting to see trains for the kids so we did the whole dining experience (apps, main, and dessert). Unfortunately after 90 minutes.. No train. Which is just a timing issue nothing to do with the restaurant- however just pointing out that we tried several food items. 

The food is fair-poor. Everything was just ok. Not worth the price. Very bland, not fresh, they definitely use a food company and heat/ serve many things; unless the chef is just that inexperienced that the food is bland and lacking anything to make us choose to go back. I think the whole experience may just be management issues and needing of a new chef. 

Overall a neat experience should you see a train go by- especially for kids. However for the price for ok food; we could of gotten food elsewhere that we enjoyed, and sat by RR tracks in the car to watch the trains. 

Side note: it was a Friday night 6-8: they were not busy at all... Hopefully management sees this as an issue and makes changes; its a great place for a restaurant they just need someone good to run it!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Great menu and the service is fantastic. I've been here with prior management/ names. And it is so much better! We like watching the trains pass by so we sit near a window. Great dining no matter where you sit! The ambiance is warm.  Dress is casual to dressy."}
{"text":"First off let me say the service we had was very good.  We went there for Valentines Day/Ash Wednesday and the issue we had was the fish dinners that were offered.  There were 3 options.   A fish and chips dinner that was on the menu which said the fish type was perch, and 2 fish options on the specials menu.  One all you can eat and another perch option which came with a baked potato and glazed carrots.
My son ordered the fish & chips (perch) off the menu and I ordered the perch special.  When the dinners were served, we both received the exact same dinners.  Two fish and chips, neither of which were perch.  They were either a cod or haddock.  I'm not one to complain or make an issue out of it, but I would confirm with your waiter or waitress exactly what fish they are serving when you order."}
{"text":"The staff has forgotten how to smile. The food was mediocre at best. French fries were freezer burnt. My company had burgers and said they were good- not great. My fish sandwich (perch) was good too. My chair literally could've fallen apart at any moment. The place was busy but I'm not sure why. 

Won't be back. Especially for 4 people totaling $74 before tip for sandwiches and a fried pickle appetizer."}
{"text":"Great selection of Appetizers- Calamari  Fries with Wasabi Cream are amazing- Best Wild Turkey Ribs- and the price so reasonable!"}
{"text":"Mediocre is the best way to describe both the food & service.

We were greeted upon entering but then as we were being escorted to a table we were told to wait while a table of 7 was seated instead.  I disregarded as poor communication between the serving staff and hostess.

A waitress came over to take our drink orders; she was pleasant but seem confused by the red wine I ordered, demonstrating lack of familiarity of the wine menu. After bringing  our drinks (she had to put a coffee stirrer in my glass to differentiate between my wine & my boyfriends Malbec) we placed our orders.

When the food came, the food runner didn't even ask if we needed anything else-I had to stop her as she was dashing away, to request ketchup.
I had the vegetarian wrap with mashed potatoes & my boyfriend had the buffalo wrap with fries.  My wrap was filled with grilled vegetables but had absolutely no seasoning and my potatoes were stale, dry, instant from a box.  My boyfriend's fries were barely warmer than room temp and his wrap was just, as I described the whole meal, mediocre.
When the server asked about the meal, I mentioned my complaint about the potatoes to which she brought me more of the same thing in a dish that had been microwaved.  
There are many more worthwhile restaurants to check out in the heart of Berea. Pass this one up."}
{"text":"I did not read reviews first, sorry fellow yelpers.   The place has had many lives and this is up there with the Pufferbelly.  We were seated in the bar side, which is two rooms with bar top tables.  The main restruant was about half filled with party, and that is another couple of rooms.  The only bad part of experience maybe the amount of seating available.

The service (our waiter was Chris) was top notch, he may have taken empty plates and napkins away too quickly.  We waited for nothing.  He gave us great menu specials and personal recommendations were spot on and seemed really personable.  This really helped the fifth star on review.

But hey Im here for the food.  I got Wild Turkey Borbon BBQ Ribs.  First of all, do not order full slab unless your are really hungry or 8 ounce burgers are appitizers.  I can usually eat full rack, and St Loius style are larger but this was no \"piglet\" ribs.  The sauce was absolutely awesome, the ribs pretty much fell off the bones, and may have been too hot when served.  The fries are shoestring style and although good, were mostly brought home with half of rack.  Dinner two was Horseradish crusted salmon.  The salmon had a little bite, and dizzle was just enough.  The wild rice was well seasoned and cooked well.  Salads were fresh mixed greens and slightly creamy italian was better than blue cheese. DONT leave without eating the bourbon pecan cream pie with ice cream!!  It is rich enough to kill two people, and you will die happy!!

They have good size wine and beer menu.  Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale was awesome and was served in brandy style glass.  But they had several other choices. Next time maybe I'll try one of the 8 ounce burgers, Bourbon Chipolte Sirlion Wrap, or Blackened shrimp.  I have seen these on others plates.  The sandwichs were $7-12 and Entrees were $16-31.  I dropped $65 on two dinners, three adult beverages, and piece of pie."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a nice place with a unique atmosphere. They had a huge bar, but I was there for lunch. I got the buffalo chicken wrap and a house salad. Both were just okay. The wrap had some type of blue cheese or something on it that I was not fond of. I'd try this place again."}
{"text":"I don't get here that often, but when I do it's always been a good experience.  The menu isn't huge, but there is something for everyone.  Their strip steak and lobster mac and cheese are my two favorites.  If you have kids that are into trains definitely ask to sit in the room by the tracks, there is always trains zipping by."}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised at their mere 2 1/2 stars.  We ate there and my sister and I both enjoyed our meals.  They were not fancy but they were properly and pleasingly composed.  The vinegar, course slaw was a nice accompaniment to the nice perch in the fish taco. Service was decent and the station itself is a treat to visit.  Order wisely and this is a four star joint!"}
{"text":"Showed up w the family on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We used to go when it was the Pufferbelly. Same interesting spot right near the train tracks
Place was fairly empty. 
They have a decent beer menu, w a good selection. 
Fried perch sandwich: it was okay. I like it crispy and this wasn't. Also the white sauce/dressing in it wasn't very flavorful. Overall I found it lackluster, not too flavorful. My dad agreed - he's a veritable perch expert. My brother liked it, but he likes everything. 
BBCO bourbon BBQ burger: pretty good. Sauce was sweet, which I like. 
Sweet potato fries were fine, not crispy. Regular fries were crispy and thin, so I liked them. Vegetable side was sautéed in balsamic vinaigrette, oozing w oil. 
Staff and server were really nice and friendly
Overall not bad, but I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"I stopped by The Berea Depot for a business lunch on a Wednesday afternoon at the suggestion of my customer. I had been there one other time a couple years ago, but that was strictly a \"day-drinking\" experience that I don't remeber all that well come to think of it... 

In any case, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of my meal and the service, and the overall atmosphere of this place. I had a spinach salad with blackened salmon, and while I agree that that may not sound like much to go on, I've had some pretty bad salmon prepared for me in higher quality places. The salmon here was perfect, nicely blackened with blackening seasoning, and slightly glistening inside. The spinach was also fresh, and the salad nicely dressed with a sesame dressing and tossed with toasted almonds, red onion, mandarin oranges, and tomatoes.

Afterwards, I read some of the reviews and was shocked by some of the poorer ones. I was then told by someone that The Berea Depot was either under new ownership or had recently hired a new chef. I don't know if either of those statements are true, but if you've had a bad experience in the past, you might want to try this place one more time. If you've never been, I would recommend that you go. I'll be back many times this summer after my delightful experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Friday afternoon 11/10/17 and right away thought something is not right when I had to go looking for the hostess. When I was seated it was way in the back where it was considerably much colder than anywhere else in the restaurant. 
  After placing my order, the food was brought to me quite quickly. But after that I saw nobody, not one person in the place came back to check on me , I might have wanted an other beer , desert , I could have been choking on my food for all they knew. When I was done I had to go looking for someone to bring me the bill. So if this is the way they run the place, with mediocre food and poor service . Or does everyone get set back in the deep freeze for their first time there, and then neglected"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday celebration with 2 of my girlfriends. Atmosphere great. Server great. Food....awful. Cold soup, room temperature salads.
This place will never make it if the food doesn't improve.  The management needs to realize that people expect a good meal for the money and you don't get that here."}
{"text":"Nope. Won't be back. Ate inside because the outdoor patio was filled with smokers. The inside was stuffy and wreaked of cigarette smoke, too. The food was average; the interior dingy. Sign near the toilets said not to flush if train was parked in station, which there was for at least a half hour while we were eating. Eeeew."}
{"text":"I am posting this review twice. It seems this restaurant is listed in two places on yelp. It is listed under Berea Union Station Tavern, and also under the name Berea Union Depot Taverne. Both names are the same place. 

We have just come home from Happy Hour at Berea Union Station Tavern (Berea Union Depot Taverne).  Our tummies are full and our spirits are high.  Good food, and good service, and so close to home. It can't be beat. 

Berea Union Station Tavern has great choices for Happy Hour including $5.00 mussels, crab cakes, specialty pizzas and sliders. I ordered their Seafood Medley pizza. A little larger than a personal sized pizza, it was full of baby shrimp, bay scallops, crabmeat, mozzarella with a white sauce. So...So... good. My husband ordered the mussels. One pound of mussels covered with a tasty, tangy red sauce and two slices of bread. Plenty of food to fill and satisfy. 

As always, the service was pleasant and efficient. The atmosphere is unique and very historic. It is a good bang for the buck. We definitely will return."}
{"text":"a great, simple place. good selection of beers, tasty burgers and appetizers. good to have a great little pub grub type of place around without it being a chain restaurant. a new fun local little hang out. 
service is efficient and friendly, fun to see all the trains passing by. neat little bit of history to the building."}
{"text":"Shows potential, but still a long way to go...

I stopped in on a Wednesday night after a long day of travel and was surprised to see this place was packed. Being a life long Berean, I've never seen more than 30 cars in the lot, so I figured I'd see what all of the hype was about...

Apparently they are the new happy hour spot in town, as I noticed a lot white collar professionals sitting at the bar. I was excited because this building has always had potential, but no one has been able to create a sustainable concept since the Puffer Belly in the late '90s.  I walked in and was impressed with the updates to the bar and dining room and my initial thoughts were finally someone gets it!

Then about 10 minutes after I arrived, \"Trivia Wednesday\" started. I was confused because it didn't seem to mesh well with the concept they were going for and as I watched the bar area empty it looked like others agreed with me. 

I ordered the BBC burger medium and it was cooked to temperature on the inside, but the outside was burnt so bad that it I'm not sure how they did it?  My food was dropped off by a hostess and the bartender was no where to be seen for 15 minutes. My beer was empty and I didn't feel like having the trivia guy's speaker in my ear anymore, so instead of sending it back I asked for my check and left.

I get the need to extend business past happy hour, but the way you do it is with your food and service, NOT trivia night!

For a similar atmosphere with awesome food, service, and beer selection try Mike's Bar & Grille just up the street."}
{"text":"Our visit to The Berea Depot was great! We ordered the flatbread and ribeye - both were delicious. They have a great drink selection and the train depot environment was very cool.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sub par food
Sub par service
Great atmosphere 
Would sit on the bar side next time
Surf and Turf was passed off as fatty steak and 4 pieces of shrimp....beware.
Prices are adequate"}
{"text":"In a word, our experience was horrible. This place has more charm than anywhere in Cleveland, but it won't make it if they don't address the food and service. Wrong food brought to table. Our food went elsewhere. Cold fries. Veggie burger was like something you'd get from GFS. Flat bed pizza? Open a can of ragu and pour it on a Saltine cracker with some cheese. Get the picture? The kitchen staff and runners are killing this place before it can even get off the ground. I won't bore you with all the other details. Hey, try it yourself and you'll see. If you go, I'd stick to the burgers, it's about all they're capable of handling at this point. Really disappointing, because this is a place I would love to see make it."}
{"text":"I checked out the Berea Depot a few weeks ago because it is new to the CLEseats app. On the app, there was a 15% discount on the bill so I gave it a try. I was very surprised at the menu. A wide variety of items   Everyone in our group found something easily. I had braised beef which was the best I have ever had. 
Everyone at the table loved their food. Definitely will come back  to try the chicken paprikas and filet oscar."}
{"text":"Great happy hour place in the bar, the restaurant is just ok.  The bar area is very quaint and cozy.  Love the ambiance.  You can sit there and watch trains go by right outside of the place.  The historic building the restaurant is in has a ton of charm and the owners really did a nice job of renovating.  Drinks are discounted during happy hour which runs till 7pm (not sure what time it starts) and there is a happy hour food menu that has a lot of variety to suite most people.  The bar maids are very friendly and nice and they know how to pour drinks.  The regular menu is a bit pricey ($10-$11 for a burger that is not really a $10-$11 burger) and the food is ok, but nothing to write home about.  We live close to this place and frequent it for the bar area and happy hour but really don't choose to go here for dinner, per se."}
{"text":"In one word - disappointing. The breaded pork chop dinner was substandard - meat was fatty and gristly. It was supposed to come with scalloped apples (which they were out of and never offered a substitute) A huge mound of \"red skin mashed\" potatoes were nothing more than instant mix mashed. Soup could be replaced for a salad, but there was an up-charge for the daily onion soup. No bread or rolls came with the meal - that was extra also. The ambiance and decor are nice, but food isn't. I doubt I would recommend or go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"You must come here for happy hour if you live in the burbs! The staff was so friendly! Pumpking was only 10 bucks a bottle...a deal if you compare it to any other bar...they are around 8.99 in the store.  Pizzas are only 5 bucks and taste way better than a typical $5 pizza... U know what I mean??? We ordered the Sicilian..with a side of marinara sauce. 

So, good happy hour here...pleasantly pleased."}
{"text":"Food and service were good, if you're into trains and history, this place is definitely for you! 

The ambience wasn't too loud, and is good for large groups."}
{"text":"Our experience was a pleasant one... We were seated immediately and when we finally saw our waitress, we learned she was attentive and had great personality.  The food was ok... Not in the wow arena but we left satisfied."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday, it was cloudy out so we werent allowed to sit outside.  We were taken inside and waited about 15 minutes, finally my son and I were served drinks.  We waited another 15 minutes, nothing.  Finally went outside and enjoyed the views. This was the only hi point.  Seemed like we were invisible so left without paying for our drinks.  Not sure how this place stays in business, sad becuase the views of trains are awesome."}
{"text":"What a cool place!  Our waitress could not be friendlier, the food was good, prices reasonable.  A great place to bring the kids - you can watch the trains go by.  Love that it is historic, too.  We may have to make the drive back out over the summer to take advantage of their patio!!"}
