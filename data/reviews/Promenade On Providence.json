{"text":"Love this shopping center. Such a lovely walk around. Peaceful and safe. Nice green area and fountains in the middle for kids or dogs. Events all the time. Concerts here in the middle of summer out on the green. Dog meets on Sunday mornings. Movies some weekends for the kids on the green. Pictures with Santa during the holidays. It's just a really nice shopping center"}
{"text":"Here to pick up my son.  This is a nice strip mall with a good selection of restaurants, and various retailers.  There's burgers, Italian,  Japanese,  starbucks,  and home Depot to walk off aome food."}
{"text":"This is a great little shopping center that is often lost in the shadows of nearby Ballantyne and Southpark.  Although there are no major anchor stores or anything unique that would drive me to this location, it is great for what it is and offers various options for both dining and shopping without having to deal with the crowds and traffic that come with some of the other locations in Charlotte.

This area is convenient to get to from both Matthews and Ballantyne so I'm often meeting friends who work in other parts of the city at the Q shack for lunch during the week days.  Another favorite of mine for dinner is Sushi 101, where there is a variety of sushi and hibachi options at reasonable prices and daily drink specials.

As I mentioned, there are no stores that are unique to this location that I'd go to but there are staples such as Ann Taylor Loft, SteinMart and Pier One if you need to make a quick trip.  And who would forget my favorite- Total Wine where you will find one of the largest beer and wine assortments in Charlotte paired with expert knowledge at some of the best prices in town."}
