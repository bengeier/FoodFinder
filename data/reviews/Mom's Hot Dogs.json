{"text":"How many times have my neighbors in Boulder City driven by this little place? I know I have hundreds of times. Boy was that a mistake.

I grew up in Chicago and love some Vienna Beef hotdogs. Stopped by today for the first time and I will be coming back for more.

First off, the owner, Denise, is super friendly. Customer service is always a must and she hit it. Secondly, the hotdogs. Brought back the memories of home after 1 bite. Hot and snappy in a steamed bun just like it should be.

If you are a fan of the Chicago dog or have never had one, be sure to swing by. You won't regret it.

PS cash only."}

A little snap in a warmed bun. Also, the frozen lemonade is refreshing on a hot summer day. Keep it up Moms!!"}
