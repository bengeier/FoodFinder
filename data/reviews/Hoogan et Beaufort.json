{"text":"4e visite à ce resto ou l'on mange très bien à partir d'une carte qui n'est pas longue mais comprend une bonne sélection. Le chef prise les ingrédients locaux. Il y a une bonne carte des vins dont un bon nombre sont disponibles au verre. Le service est attentionné -- un des points forts."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Hoogan et Beaufort last summer.   Every dish was incredibility beautiful looking.  Service was top notch, very well trained staff that were highly attentive towards their tables.  Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was very good, clearly an attentive kitchen staff- open fire is their concept so everything has a charcoal or \"burnt\" taste it it. Their house focaccia was a quite dense and nothing to write home about but the other dishes were tasty and beautifully presented with many elements giving them layers of flavour. Their venison was fantastic. I thought it was quite overpriced and maybe it was an off night for the staff but they didn't seem to be the most attentive servers. They had some very nice wine suggestions to pair with our meal."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but the dishes were very disappointing for how little was on each plate and how much theey cost. Octopus was overcooked and plates seemed uninspired. Best part of the meal was the beer and the service.  Must see if you like overpriced excellently presented mediocre food."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 and opted for the Chef's Tasting Menu. MY GOD am I glad we did because this was without a doubt the BEST restaurant experiences of my life. The lightly seared scallops served with grilled asparagus on top of asparagus ice cream was pure magic. Truly, everything was perfection. This is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Great service, great site, great wine list (impressive), outstanding cuisine - a very fine representation of the very best Montreal has to offer- don't take my word for it, read the reviews from real restaurant critics.   In my opinion also the best value I have seen considering the talent in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  Everything was excellent, especially the Chicken Liver Mousse appetizer.  We were in town for 4 days and hit up some other well-reviewed spots, but this was by far the best.  Sort of a weird location, especially for a restaurant with such high quality food, but it is well worth the uber drive from downtown or Vieux Montreal.  Will definitely recommend Hoogan et Beaufort to friends visiting and will make it a point to visit the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Everything about this place was top notch - the food, the service and the ambience. We had the red snapper tar tar ($16?), burrata plate with cashews ($20) and for our main, shared the lobster and pork dish ($85). Each dish was excellent. To be clear, the lobster and pork dish was meant to be shared, so that $85 was for both of us.   We sat at the bar but the service we received was better than most places. Our cute waiter patiently described each of the dishes ( in English) and made some great recommendations. We felt so welcomed.  I can't wait to go back! And with the competition in MtL, that's saying something!   Oh, and the decor is super trendy and cute. A tad bit on the pricey side, but the food they offer is unique."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, high ceiling and windows with open kitchen, yet not too loud; good service but expensive. All dishes are beautiful with different mix of ingredients. However, there were hit and miss, and some of our appetizers were extremely salty, while others were well balanced and delicious. The côte-de-boeuf was tasty but felt overpriced. They do have a decent beer and wine selection Recommended if you are looking for a fancy dinner with matching drinks, otherwise there are so many restaurants in Montreal more suitable for foodies."}
{"text":"Le service est impeccable et très attentionné sans être trop. La nourriture est excellente, chaque petit détail a sa place. Beau décor."}
{"text":"This is my first visit, but definitely not my last. Very impressed with the dishes I tried, the service as well the gorgeous space.   The restaurant was actually a little hard to find. Tucked away in the Angus shops, we parked street side and walked over to the beautiful light up space you can spot from Molson street.   As soon as we walked in, this overwhelming feeling of warmth and comfort instantly came over me. The space is tastefully decorated, with minimalism and class. Everything revolves around the open kitchen, which stands out by its burning flame. Upon arrival, the waiter explained they use the flame to \"burn\" the food, a technique they've mastered for adding just the right amount of flavour without the burnt taste.   The menu follows an Italian inspiration, with entres, primi and secondi plates. Although I would say the cuisine was much more of international fusion, than purely Italian.   That said, we started with fire grilled focaccia, which was nice. For entres we tried a fusion of the topinambour and the Quebec mozzarella, the former won this round. We then continued with the Parisian gnocchi and lamb collier ravioli. The ravioli really did steal the show here. And finally we ended with the beef short ribs, cooked to perfect with all of its juices. The portions were not huge (which I like) and the food was truly rich in flavour.   My review wouldn't be complete without a compliment on the excellent service we received. A table filled with foodies and a pregnant lady, we definitely weren't easy to manage. But, our waiter did an outstanding job of answering all our questions and guiding our choices.   Although it's always hard to accurately judge a new restaurant in its first few weeks of opening, I have to say Hoogan & Beaufort really struck a cord."}
{"text":"A perfect brunch! This is why...  Upon walking into the restaurant, we were greeted by a wonderful smell of a wood fired grill. Already it felt comforting and lovely. Not to mention the kind & polite gentleman who greeted us.  Looking around(I'm an observer) I noticed how nice and different architecturally this restaurant is. Modern, but still with a cozy, and rustic to it. Not fancy, simply rustic.   We had a lovely table of two looking towards the open kitchen seeing the hard working staff. Because the kitchen was quite close to our table, we had an extra hit of a fireplace smell. Lovely!   We ordered(to share!) a monkey bread(Or pull apart bread) that was served alongside of a lemon sweet cream. For those that are not familiar with monkey bread, it's little sweet rounds of dough rolled in cinnamon & sugar baked together. Since it's sticky, you pull it apart with your hands. Yes it's messy.. but worth every lick of your fingers. Delicious!  I ordered a hot chocolate(prepared to perfection!!) Could be a tad warmer, but it was still quite delicious.  Now to eat.. I ordered a Croque Madame served with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top of two delicious crusty perfectly toasted(On their wood grill!) sandwich of Béchamel sauce and a lovely Coppa ham. Outstanding! Along side was a coleslaw(It was OK!) and a tender oh so fresh spinach salad. Delicious!   We also ordered a dish which had two perfectly poached eggs, a lovely and delicate Hollandaise sauce on top of two slices of perfectly toasted country bread. Superb!  Overall our experience at Hoogan & Beaufort was perfect. Two little things that I would hope they change soon, the server was a bit slow yet very kind and polite.  Do keep in mind the restaurant is situated a bit out of the way and somewhat in a remote area. Don't let that turn you off. whether you go by car, foot, or any other way. It's well worth the mileage. I promise you!  I certainly will be returning!"}
{"text":"Mon amie me disait que le restaurant était toujours plein le week-end, alors on a essayé d'y aller spontanément un mardi soir à 19h30. Le restaurant était rempli à environ 40% de sa capacité.   Décor Le design intérieur du restaurant est vraiment bien. Il fait penser aux restaurants en Espagne qui mettent beaucoup plus d'énergie qu'ici sur le décor intérieur du restaurant. La cuisine est à aire ouverte et est incluse dans l'environnement. Il y une section \"bar\" en rentrant et en plein milieu du restaurant. L'éclairage extérieur et les beaux luminaires suspendus d'un très haut plafond apportent une belle ambiance à la salle.  Service  Côté service, c'est très attentionné, sans prétention et agréable. Le serveur nous décrivait bien le vin qui était en important privée. Le prix du vin est très raisonnable. Nous avons eu le service par trois serveurs différents.   Ambiance Très belle ambiance. Restaurant assez grand pour un souper entre amis, mais idéal pour un souper romantique.   Menu Nous avons eu une description du menu. Le menu est divisé en 4 sections : 6 entrées plus traditionnelles, 4 entrées de pâtes, 5 choix de plats principaux et 4 choix d'entrée. Un menu dégustation avec accord mets et vins est disponible pour 110 $ par personne ou 65 $ sans l'accord. (Voir photo)  Entrée Plusieurs choix difficiles s'imposaient. Finalement, nous avons opté pour la pieuvre grillée et les raviolis aux homards en entrée. La pieuvre était tendre, mais je l'aurais aimé un peu plus grillée. J'ai par exemple préféré la texture de la pieuvre mangée chez GeMa. C'était un bon plat, bien équilibré en terme de goût. La pieuvre était accompagnée d'une pomme de terre ratte, olives, poivron brûlé et yogourt. Les ravioli étaient sensationnelles. Le radis melon d'eau était un excellent choix pour accompagné et décoré l'assiette. Je l'aurais bien pris en plat principal et c'est possible en doublant le prix. Le seul bémol est le prix de ces entrées. Les portions sont suffisantes pour une entrée, mais 38$ pour 3 raviolis et 3 tranches d'une pieuvre, bien sûr accompagnés de bons légumes, classe ce restaurant dans la gamme la plus haute des prix de restaurant à Montréal, mais cela peut se justifier par la qualité des produits dans l'assiette.     Plat principal En plat principal, nous avons partagé les short ribs de boeuf et la morue. Nous avons apprécié les plats. Cependant, il manquait un accompagnement pour les ribs. J'aurais aimé avoir un peu plus de légumes dans l'assiette pour le rendre le plat complet. L'assiette de morue était bien généreuse et que dire de plus que c'était excellent.   Dessert Nous avons partagé le Curd au citron brûlé et avons bien apprécié l'acidité du dessert.   Prix Pieuvre, Ravioli Homard, Short Rib, Morue, Curd au citron, Vin blanc avec taxes = 165.56 $.   Commentaires J'ai mangé à ma faim et j'ai un bon appétit. Les plats n'étaient pas trop lourd. On aurait aimé avoir une terrasse ou des fenêtres ouvertes. J'y retournerai pour essayer les autres entrées de pâtes sur le menu."}
{"text":"I'd liked to give 3.5 but since I can't, I think 4 is more accurate than three. Nice place with cool decor and ingratiating staff.   We had the octopus, sweetbreads and the veal steak. All we're very good but slightly under-salted. Salt on the table would have made this dinner a solid 4-5.   Their charred focaccia was not great. Not very flavorful bread to start and the burn wasn't for me."}
{"text":"We've now made Hoogan et Beaufort our first stop on our annual Montreal food tour two years in a row, and it again did not disappoint. Both the food and service rank smog Montreal's best, which is saying something in such a wonderful food city. You really can't go wrong here. A quick tip: Sit at the front bar with bartender Antoine and you'll be in very good hands. He does an excellent job."}
{"text":"Obscènité et décadence.  Nous avons pris le menu dégustation avec l'accord des vins. Et nous n'avons pas été déçu. Des entrées au dessert, on a fait plaisir à nos papilles. Nous avons même mangé sur la terrasse par une chaude soirée de fin... septembre. Nous le recommandons chaudement. Idéal pour souligner un anniversaire en grand."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable! The quality of service food and experience can't be matched. I explained wine preferences based on me and my husbands likes and our server found the perfect wine! Our meal blew our minds. Best foie gras dish I've had in Montreal. We were also recommended the pasta which we usually do not go for but it again was unbelievable. This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal and I will recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to visit this beautiful city! Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"I dined here on March 11, 2018 and today, March 31st 1100 miles away, I am still dreaming and drooling over the lamb orecchiette I had here. It was the perfect combination of flavors and textures. The lamb was sinfully tinder and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The dish was seasoned with an incredibly skilled hand; it was bursting with flavor, but perfectly balanced. I'd eat it every day if I could! On top of this, the service was absolutely lovely. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and it continued until the very moment I left. The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place serves very high quality food in a wonderful setting.   They were able to accommodate me with a vegetarian tasting menu, for which I was very thankful and impressed.   The food was delicious. The service is good, but a bit slow at times between courses.   Overall, this is a great place to go with a group or as a couple for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"A 6:30 dinner reservation with 2 kids. We stressed that the kids were very hungry and it is now 8:15 and still no food. Food may be good if it ever gets here but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Service amazing Drinks well made Food, God, wish I can come back anyway!!!  Had the skate wing and skirt steaks. So good. The bread. Speechless  And desert , don't ever say no to anything"}
{"text":"Love that restaurant.my boyfriend and I go there all the time.the food is amazing,the wine selection is always perfect and very good service."}
{"text":"Considering the number of restaurants in Montreal, there are only a few places which after having done once, I'd go again and again...Hoogan & Beaufort is one of them! Having had dinner and lunch here multiple times, the food, service and whole experience has always been fantastic!   My last visit here was with a group of friends for lunch where I enjoyed a beet and cheesehead entree, an octopus and chorizo tagliatelle main, and a deconstructed chocolate ganache cake for dessert. I must admit that the pasta was a little too salty due to the chorizo for my taste, I still think that the dishes here are always delicious. I enjoy the play of flavours and textures; the ingredients, which are always fresh and seasonal, allow for a varying and interesting menu at every visit.   If you do have the chance to visit this spot, I recommend you let the knowledgeable sommelier help you pick a perfect wine; I'm always ecstatic with the choice.   The service is personable, and professional; your dishes are explained as they are served, and the small touches  make you feel extra special! One of my fave restos in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! What a great all around experience ambiance, service and food! If you are staying in downtown it is definitely worth the car ride!   The open wood burning fire plays an important part in all of their dishes and gives off a great aroma which plays perfectly into your dining experience.   I had the sweetbreads appetizer which was amazing. They were cooked perfectly with a crisp exterior and served with some radish and mustard garnish. My wife had the octopus appetizer which was great but the burnt yogurt sauce was unreal, absolutely brillant!  The veal chop was my main course served with fava beans and vegetables, cooked to perfection. My wife had the Cornish hen which was also phenomenal.   This is going to be a spot that I will absolutely return to everyone I'm back in Montreal. Truly a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour le brunch du dimanche matin. Je dois avouer que la première chose qui m'a frappé en y entrant est l'odeur du feux de bois; cela donne un accueil des plus chaleureux et confortable. Le service était impeccable; dès notre arriver on nous offre de prendre notre manteau, une attention des plus agréable.   Nous étions assis au bar. D'habitude, je ne suis pas trop fan de ce genre de place mais je dois avouer que j'ai adoré y être assigné dans ce resto; l'espace est fait de manière à ce que l'on se sente très à l'aise.  Au niveau de la nourriture, le restaurant propose une carte des plus surprenantes tellement que tout me semblait alléchant et intriguant. Nous avons opté pour les madeleines au sarrasin et mascarpone à partager, puis j'ai pris la crêpe et mon accompagnateur les oeufs brouillés à la morue. Les madeleines étaient correct sans plus. Il manquait le petit côté \"punché\". Cependant, la crêpe fut un véritable délice. Le mélange de yogourt, poire, compote de pomme et pâte de coing fut une très belle découverte. Je le conseille fortement. Pour les plus conservateurs d'entre vous, essayez les oeufs brouillés à la morue; il s'agit exactement de cela, sans surprise. Mon accompagnateur semblait très satisfait de son choix.  Bref, le rapport qualité/prix est plus que raisonnable et j'y retournerai certainement pour le service, l'odeur, l'ambiance décontracté et pour découvrir de nouvelles saveurs."}
{"text":"Great food. Service, when available, is fairly good. The time that languished between courses and when checking out is too much. Forgot to bring a beverage that we ordered. Had to ask for the bill twice."}
{"text":"Well thought out concept,this is evident in the decor as soon as you enter. The place has a trendy buzz with its industrial look. One can't help but notice the high ceiling with wood beams, the large windows and open kitchen concept and central bar. The decor is modest yet modern in a way. Seating is comfortable, lines clean and unfussy. What is awesome for the patrons of Hoogan and Beaufort is definitely its kitchen and its fire pit. Strategically placed at the center of the room you can watch the staff creating their lovely gastronomic dishes that incorporate local products and ingenious creations of dishes with the most original of ingredients. The show itself can keep you inspired for hours. Service here is excellent, impeccably professional, solicitous and accommodating. Hoogan & Beaufort is for those traditional foodies who appreciate good food in a cool hip environment."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant! Little small so we had to take their first reservation at 5:30 on a Saturday but weren't rushed out AT ALL. Our waiter, Olivier, was incredibly helpful and funny! The food was fantastic. Definite must try!"}
{"text":"Good address serving very good food. Gentle and smiling staff.  Beautifully designed restaurent with nice cellar and bar."}
{"text":"Great food , good prices and very good wine selection. The area is def undiscovered by lots of Montrealers but great for easy parking and not too hard to reach. The ambiance is relaxed and unlike some newer restos , does not have noise pollution. Our group sampled Cod fish, lobster, veal ribs , pasta which were all excellent . And the sweet bread , octopus and Bass tartar were great too. Do not forget to get their focaccia bread with the fantastic accompanying butter. A must return for our group ."}
{"text":"My wife and I booked a reservation here based on an Eater review and were disappointed. We arrived on a Friday night and the place was packed - and really loud. Also the space is not that interesting - very industrial and cold. We had requested seats at the bar but on arrival were told they could only offer us a table by the window. The food was a mixed bag; we loved the bone marrow but the grilled octopus was drowning in a cream sauce and buried under wilted greens. The service was fine until I ordered an espresso, which was cold. When I told the waiter, instead of replacing it he argued that the water was 90 degrees and that he had tested it and it was fine. Whatever happened to \"the customer is always right?\" In a city renowned for great food this place isn't worth the trek."}
{"text":"Oh my god, what a perfect evening. It started with a warm welcome to a picture perfect venue for dinner. The open kitchen with a huge wood burning fireplace created a wealth of warmth. The table and bar seating are beautiful and comfortable and are perfectly matched with the environment. (I would pick the bar seating even for a group of 4). The menu was great, I literally wanted to try everything. I did two entrees, one pasta and one main. The servings are not huge so you won't over do it. The tapinambour was warm and delicious, the ravioli was perfect and I finished with the short rib. I enjoyed all three and regretted not have the tasting menu at $65. Overall a great Montréal experience, you must try."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I had in Montreal. We chose the chef's tasting for lunch and I was blown away by each course! The ambience was great, too. A little hard to find and off the beaten path but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I try not to set my expectations too high when I hear about a restaurant that is generating lots of buzz for fear that it won't live up to the hype. That being said sometimes I just can't help getting excited.  That was the case most recently with Hoogan and Beaufort, a restaurant that had long been on my list of places to try.    Hoogan and Beaufort is located in the old Angus Yards.  If you are driving there is plenty of parking available on the street and it is all free.  If you are coming by transit then your best bet is to go to Prefontaine metro and walk up.  There might also be a bus that goes north from the metro but you'll have to check that.  The interior is beautiful with its high ceilings and exposed beams.  The design can best be described as industrial.  They have an open kitchen so you can see the everything that is going on while they prepare your food.  If you are only two you might want to consider sitting at the bar which looks directly onto the kitchen so you can see the cooks working their magic.    At this restaurant the menu is small and focused.  They are one of those places that likes to prepare a few dishes very well.  The main appeal of the menu offerings is that lots of the food is cooked over an open fire so that imparts a smoky flavour to it.  In fact you can smell that fire going from the moment you walk in.  It lets you know that you are in for a treat!  We started with burnt focaccia which was delicious.  As you can imagine it has a charred taste to it and the focaccia itself was wonderfully fresh and almost delicate in texture.  We also split some appetizers of grilled mushrooms and grilled squid.  The squid's texture was perfect and there were rice chips with it that added a nice crunch.  The mushrooms had a smoky flavour from being grilled.  I followed this up with strozzapretti with chorizo and squid.  The chorizo was spiced perfectly and the pasta was freshly made so it was very delicious.  There didn't seem to be much squid but I did enjoy the meal as a whole.  I finished that off with a panna cotta with short bread and mango sorbet.  This was the climax to a wonderful meal.  The short bread was flaky and buttery while the panna cotta had excellent texture and taste.  They had used real vanilla beans to flavour it instead of extract and that definitely made a difference.  Every dish's plating was absolutely gorgeous.  The service was the one downside for me.  We had a bit of a wait at times between courses or when we wanted to place an order.  While the waiters were friendly enough they definitely could have been faster.  It wasn't the worst service that I have experienced but it definitely wasn't one of the better ones either.  When it comes to prices I found that the appetizers and desserts were a little expensive given their size.  The mains were more fairly priced though.  That being said when you want to treat yourself or celebrate a big occasion the splurge is worth it because the quality of the dishes was very high.  It has been a long time since I enjoyed a restaurant meal as much as I enjoyed the one I had at Hoogan and Beaufort.  It definitely deserves all the hype that it gets and is definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We made reservations on a Friday night at 9 pm for three people, When we got there our table wasn't ready and we had to wait. The guys were so hungry and after about fifteen minutes of waiting they decided they wanted to go eat at the pizzeria next door. I think one waiter saw that he had gone to check if the pizzeria had a table available because when he came back a waiter came up to us to tell us that our table was ready and even gave us a glass of bubbly each (it was like cava but from a different region in Spain).   We had the focaccia bread. It was warm and soft. It was so good we ordered a second round but also because the duck tartare we ordered didn't come with any bread or chips. We also had the grilled octopus with fingerling potato, olives, and burnt pepper yogurt. with fermented white beet, black garlic, lemon and rice chips. I've had better grilled octopus.   We also had two pasta dishes. The first was tomato farfalle with duck consommé, poultry meatballs, fennel and kale. The consommé was tasty but we didn't have spoons. I did dip the foccaccia in the broth. The second pasta dish was the garganelli pasta with lamb, cauliflower, pistachio, and cheese. The lamb was delicious but the pasta was a bit undercooked for my liking. Lastly we shared the short rib and the beef sirloin. The meats were probably the best thing we ate that night. Overall the food was good but it didn't wow me and I do not think i would go back."}
{"text":"Nice environment, great service, beautiful plate, but does not fit my flavor profile. Overall, okay restaurant, quiet place and great decoration."}
{"text":"Anticipation is a tricky thing. As you wait, you get more and more excited but at the same time, if you have to wait too long, eventually that enthusiasm dies down and you completely forget what you were anticipating in the first place. Then there is also the fear of what you are anticipating being not as awesome as you hope it would be. These emotions are always playing with one another in moments of anticipation - be it vacation spots, product launches and, for the purpose of this discussion, restaurant openings. Chef Marc-André Jetté, since his departure from the excellent Les 400 Coups in 2013, has kept us waiting for his next project for some time now. And as the projects of his previous collaborator Patrice Demers developed, we were left wondering more and more when the time would come, if ever. Finally, the announcement came that he and his partner William Saulnier would be opening up in the Angus Yards district in Rosemont - not quite the most vibrant of food areas but nevertheless it got me intrigued. Once Hoogan et Beaufort opened up in December and the excellent reviews came from all the big critics in the city a few months later, it left me pining for his cuisine once more and anticipating the moment when I would head out there to check it out.  Located in an old factory in the Angus Yards development, Hoogan et Beaufort has a very appealing look - super high ceilings, open concept with the fire pit in the back of the house as well as the vine cellar and stacks of firewood visible to all, a nice bar area up front. The space uses the old industrial elements like exposed metal I-beams and the brick walls but pairs them with wood lats and more modern touches like a huge metallic magnetized wall in the kitchen area. Lighting is ample but nicely dim to get a nice intimate enough atmosphere. The downside to the high ceilings is that noise level isn't perfect - music, when noticeable, was a nice mix that I enjoyed but when the space was crowded, it barely registered.  Chef Jetté, prior to opening his restaurant, talked to Eater Montreal about doing similar cuisine as he had at Les 400 Coups but more accessible and less upscale. Fresh cuisine and soignée. His menu here consists of a few entrées, a fresh pasta section, mains et some desserts. The fire pit and the use of it plays heavily into the menu and in fact in the smell of the restaurant. A hint of smokiness throughout.  For entrees, my girlfriend and I went with a plate of brunt focaccia bread and butter as well as a dish of grilled squid with ratte potatoes (both as chips and fingerling), olives and a burnt pepper yogurt. Saying that the bread was burnt is a bit of stretch but regardless the focaccia was nice and warm with that hint of smokiness you get from grilling it over the fire. The grilled squid was excellent - a lovely texture with some char to it. I like the creaminess of the brunt pepper yogourt as well as the slight sweetness that came from it. The potato chips provided a little crunch. This was an excellent mix of elements all coming together.  Our first main was Gaspor suckling pig served with salsify purée, curls of sliced apple and an oatmeal crumble. I loved this dish. The pork was beautiful and cooked to perfection. I'd never had salsify before but the earthiness of the root vegetable pureed so smoothly paired nicely with the sweet apple, the oatmeal and the fatty pork. Another well-balanced and measured dish.  Our other main was beef short rib served with celeriac puree, marinated onion, grilled Brussel sprouts and crispy bread. Another hit at our table. Beautiful char on the beef cooked beautifully with all its inherent fattiness intact. The caramelization on the sprouts brought such a nice flavour and eliminated any bitterness one often associates with Brussel sprouts. The onion and celeriac balanced themselves well and the bread added some extra texture.  Desserts was equally as enjoyable. First up was burnt lemon curd with a Anicet Honey caramel, candied lemon peel and buckwheat shortbread cookie. A very bright dish - the combination of the sour lemon curd and the sweet caramel was so nice to enjoy. I liked how you picked up the burnt elements of the curd and how the honey came through in the caramel.  Our second dessert was the cranberry charlotte - a pillow of vanilla mousse served over a cranberry compote and pieces of almond nougat. Another great contrast of flavours and texture - the freshness of the cranberries coming through to give a real bitterness but the mousse lightening it up.  As mentioned before, expectations can be very high with anticipation but Hoogan et Beaufort met them completely. The cuisine soignée Chef Jetté was known for is alive and well here - with excellent service and a beautiful look. I know to some that Rosemont is a little out of the way but believe me, it's worth a try. I think Hoogan et Beaufort will definitely make it worth your while.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening to celebrate my husband's birthday! Everything was spot on! From the place itself, to the drinks, to the service and to the food! We were blown away!  They offer a tasting menu (70$) with wine pairing (45$) but we opted à la carte because we wanted to try as much different plates as possible. Plus the wine pairing summed up to 2 1/2 glasses of wine per 45$. In the other hand, we opted for a bottle of red wine that came highly recommended by the sommelier. We were very happy with it! Here's what we ordered:  Grilled focaccia, warm oysters, albacore tuna, grilled octopus, two different plates of homemade pastas and a beef strip loin. (Menu description on their site) It was all delicious! Well executed with finesse and cooked to the perfect texture and temperature. We were too full to try their desserts :/   Certainly next time because i will be coming back!  Attentive, professional and all around friendly staff. No wonder that this place comes highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A bit out of the way if you're staying in Vieux Montreal, but worth a visit.  Our Uber ride back to the site of the jazz festival was $13.93 CAN.  We each started with six warm oysters with apple sabayon; I could have easily eaten two dozen.  We then opted for the cucumber appetizer, the grilled octopus appetizer, blackened bread which had a nice doughy texture and then grilled trout, followed by buttermilk panna cotta.  Really fresh food, with delicious wood grilled/fired flavors.  A fair amount of food that didn't leave us feeling too full."}
{"text":"The duck was very good, looking forward to come back."}
