{"text":"On our first visit, my husband and I both ordered sandwiches. Each plate comes with two sandwiches, so you can share and try your partner's choice as well. 
Mine was Bacon N Egg, and my husband went for Ham N Cheese. While I quite like my husband's choice, I totally loved my Bacon N Egg sandwich. The other nice thing was that we got to choose between brown or white for the bread. My husband also ordered a soup as his side which I didn't try, but he seemed happy with it.

Our server was a nice and caring lady. The place had a kind of family feeling to it. Most of the other tables looked as if they were locals.

This will definitely be one our first choices of breakfast places in the neighborhood. So, we'll be back for sure! 
I also must mention that the prices are quite reasonable for the portion."}
{"text":"When a restaurants is quiet on a Friday night, you'd have to think there's something wrong with the food or the service...Good Bite looks like it's seen better days.

Having walked by and vaguely interested in breakfast for dinner, we were promptly seated and the waitress gave us water and menus right away. The green vinyl seats and the bleary eyed cook behind the grill instantly made me think of a old-time greasy spoon, the kind you'd see in a 50s movie. The music playing really helped to emphasize the nostalgic feel. 

I chose a western omelet with their home fries. I was kinda excited because the smell of grease was making me hungry, this was like a very homey version of Fran's (I thought to myself). Then I took a sip of water and I wanted to get out of there (the glass of water was cold, but everything tasted soapy...I was thirsty and mortified).

The food arrived quickly and thankfully did not taste of soap, just layered in grease, which was welcome. The omelet was slightly overcooked (on the dry side), but the \"home fries\" were decent...somewhat crispy outside and soft on the inside...it all could have used a bit of a kick, but otherwise I was mostly glad I wasn't eating soap for dinner -- not really my idea of cleansing the palate!"}
{"text":"In 2000, this was my neighbourhood family brunch spot... What will you discover inside? Simple traditional styled booths and soda bar, waitstaff ready with apron, order pad and pen behind the ear, an everyone is welcome attitude,  the upfront business of the grill sizzling hot with home fries or dinner cuts to invite you in on a cold day and family vacation photos from Greece hanging on the walls like a travel journal. There is even a dessert display case with rice pudding bowls and sundae dishes trembling with cubed jello and whipped cream topping. The food is standard diner fare, straight-up, and served with a common sense attitude about what is good.  Fun and rowdy for weekend brunches, a quiet haven for bookish types  late Sunday afternoon.  Nothing too fancy, but you will leave full and not wondering if you spent too much.  Respect and kindness go a long way in this family business."}
{"text":"I really like the food but I've seen some silverfish on the counter at the front of the store on a couple occasions. Definitely put me off my breakfast. But if you're not put off by critters then the cheese omelette is pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that a genuine \"greasy spoon\" can survive in such a trendy and high-maintenance neighbourhood (Yonge and Eglinton). I've lived in this neighbourhood for 15 years and have been coming here for at least a decade.

Great omelettes and home fries, fresh coffee with free refills, and wonderful peameal bacon. So many of us are weekend regulars that the staff (all longtime employees) recognize and chat with us.

All that for less than $10/person? Why go anywhere else for breakfast/brunch? In fact, why not go for dinner, too?"}
{"text":"A nice simple breakfast spot done the old fashioned way. The restaurant, if I can call it that (because it's actually more of a diner)is run by a very nice Greek family and the service is always quick and the food is always delicious. It is also not overly expensive, with a good wholesome plate of food running you about $8."}
{"text":"The people working here are soo friendly, the food here is great they accommodate your needs"}
{"text":"Love their sausages and fried potatoes.  Great place for breakfast, but always a line up."}
{"text":"Sick of Cora's (seriously), we went searching for a proper, greasy diner.  Good Bite is in the neighborhood we needed to be in, so we head out in search of all day breakfast.  

Parking can be slightly tricky.  It's street parking, so it's hit or miss.  We got lucky.  

The tables are pretty small.  We had 5 people in our group and it was a tight squeeze.  The menu is pretty standard.  Old Greek women seem to have the service handled, never letting  your coffee cup even come close to being empty.  We ordered eggs and bacon and eggs and sausage.  Both came out exactly as ordered.  Bacon was yummy and crispy.  Hashbrowns were basic.  Toast satisfactory.  

The two ancient Greek men doing the cooking were A) pretty old and B) seriously fast.  It took no more than 10 minutes to place the order and get our food.  They also didn't rush us along or kick us out.  We might not make a trip simply to visit Good Bite, but we would definitely go back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Club sandwich all the way!!!  So good and yet so old school!"}
{"text":"It's your typical, old school diner. You come here because sometimes nothing but pile of greasy pile of bacon and eggs, or a club sandwich with a huge pile of fries is the only thing that hits the spot."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area, looking for an old-fashioned kind of diner to take my grown-up daughters to. I had searched the Yelp reviews in the area but found that most were Greek, Italian, Asian, Portuguese and even a restaurant to satisfy someone with a Chef's palate. What I was seeking was a \"Greasy Spoon Diner\" and that is exactly what I got! (Minus the grease)!

Unfortunately, this diner was exactly what droves of other patrons were seeking also as the decibels of voices made it difficult for us to communicate without raising our own voices to communicate with each other.

But the food and service was was exactly what we wanted! I ordered the calves liver with bacon and Onions and it was the best I'd ever had! It's hard to find a place that serves such good quality of liver anywhere these days! My daughters had the traditional eggs/ crispy great quality bacon/ peamealed back bacon, eggs cooked to perfection. 

It was a very hot and humid day and the front door stayed open. At first I was wary that it might be too hot and stuffy inside but the fans kept the air circulating and we felt very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We found that if we just \"leaned in\" and spoke to each other, the booths sheltered our conversations.

I took note that all of the patrons enjoyed themselves immensely and went away making note to myself to come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is the best greasy spoon! Great family owned vibe, feel like my mom is feeding my when I go here. Food is great, breakfasts are always spot on. Lots of choices for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This place must have been around for a while. Everything inside needs to soon retire; the furniture, the tableware even the waitresses look exhausted.
I noticed that they use the cheapest bread you can find in the market, the kind they sell at the dollar store.
The food  is greasy, the egg whites in my eggs were runny and my bacon turned into ashes when I poked it with my fork.
Nothing about this place was attractive to me :("}
{"text":"*** Second Visit Update ***

Took two friends back this morning (OK, OK, around noon).  Barely beat the rush - they were jammed right after we got there.  Even then, breakfast was fantastic, although coffee refills were a little harder to come by.  Maybe bring your own really big cup."}
{"text":"This is a a regular breakfast hang out for me.  I've taken pretty much all of my friends and family to this diner which is old fashioned in a wonderful way and as another reviewer mentioned, very unpretentious and down to earth. It serves the breakfast basics plus a lunch menu which I know nothing about as I only come for the breakfast special; sausages, eggs, toast, potatoes and coffee.  
Basic fare but very well done and it hits the spot. 
In addition to the food, another draw  is the atmoshpere which is really old school with green covered boths, laid out iagainst the wall.  The staff are attentive and friendly and add to the old-school atmosphere.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Forgot to rate this place when we ate here ages ago.  I hadn't been here for 20 years, but it used to be a regular place when I lived in the area.

i like the true diner vibe of this place with an open kitchen and counter.  I remember the food as being average, but my friends don't have good memories.

Sorry I can't be more specific as memory fails, but it's a good greasy spoon option if you're tired of Mars down the road."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical greasy breakfast place serving your standard breakfast options at a reasonable price. 

Our waitress was a lady in her 50's who was pleasant enough, but busy and the service wasn't too bad either. 

I slightly prefer Mars Uptown Diner to this place because I find the food a little less greasy and seating a little more comfortable (the benches here are rigid as can be) but overall they're pretty similar experience at both. 

Funny story, we tipped the waitress just a little over 15% like good restaurant goers but as she picked up the bill two toonies fell out and intro her serving pouch without her even noticing. Before we could saying anything she hurried away to deal with another table. I'm sure she thought we had stiffed her. We debated talking to her about it but decided it would all be the same in the end for her and left feeling slightly bemused by the whole situation.

If you're in the mood for a greasy breakfast and this is what's close by, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"First visit to Good Bite. Very clean with traditional Diner interior. Excellent service with fast refills on coffee. My Egg White Vegetable Omelette was hot and fresh. Good ingredients. We also had an order of pancakes. They were fluffy and hot. Very tasty. Menu a bit simple. It would be nice to have some creative dishes such as fresh fruit in the pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is a definite must try! If you love diner food you will love this place! Their burgers and fries are on the pricey side, but worth it! Will return again!"}
{"text":"i love their breakfasts aswell as the open turkey sandwich gravy meal"}
{"text":"Totally awesome old school greesy spoon spot! if you are looking for fancy breakfasts - not the right place, but if you are on a lookout   for your basic eggs/bacon/potatoes  plate with a nice cup of coffee  - this is the spot!  the staff is really great - good service and tons of smiles :)"}
{"text":"I understand greasy diner food and completely embrace it. 
But this was disappointingly dismal. $9 for frozen sausages, lackluster scrambled eggs and mushy-not-tasty potatoes? 
Ehhh, pass. 
Nice folks and good service, but it shouldn't have cost more than $5...and the food was just not good. Sorry"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since I was in high school! Their friendly service and generous portions make this a neighborhood gem. Breakfast is their specialty.

However, one point of constructive criticism, is that they could afford to have some aesthetic upgrades. In 25  years, nothing has been updated/renovated."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Fairly inexpensive. 10 for 3 eggs and sausage. Wasn't anything special but it still tasted good. Their home fries didn't make me hate them so that's a plus. I'm usually never fan, some are decent but I had my fair share I didn't like

So all in all good meal, not too costly."}
{"text":"I just love places that have been in the neighborhood for over 40 years. It means 
1. they have amazing food 
2. the prices are decent
3. the service is good.

Good Bite has all of these elements.
I had 3 eggs poached (to perfection), sausage, ham, toast, homefries and a coffee for $6. The portion size was huge! I also think the lost art of Ham was revitalized be adding it to the meal.
The grease not only lined my stomach, but also lined the plate afterwards! Sounds gross, but when your in the mood for something greasy this is the place to go.
The staff (2 cooks serve as the chef and service) were great, and what you would expect from a place like this. There is about 7 tables, and a sit up bar inside. 
Sunday morning blues can be left behind with an amazing breakfast from Good Bite."}
{"text":"I recently spent a weekend in Toronto and we visited Good Bite our first morning in Toronto.    For this being in a larger city, I was expecting much more and found this place to be mediocre at best.   

It is a typical \"mom & pop\" dive diner.   The place is fairly small and the booth we sat in was cramped for four grown adults.    Good luck having a conversation as this place it is quite noisey.  

The food here is bland.  I ordered a Greek omelet and it was nowhere near being Greek.   The eggs were runny, had little feta cheese and the only vegetable was tomatoes.     By comparison, other Greek omelets I have had at other eateries generally consist of eggs, feta, black olives, tomatoes, and spinach.   The coffee I ordered came in very small cups, after two sips my cup was empty and the waitress only came back once or twice to refill it.    

The cost for the meal was also sort of pricey, besides my omelet, I had a side of bacon.    So for the omelet that came with toast, bacon and coffee the meal came to just around $20.     For that price, I could of stayed at my hotel and ordered room service or had dinner in the hotel cafe.  

I guess even though we Americans have our faults, I can at least say we can and know how to eat well !!!"}
{"text":"Service was fast. I've been here a number of times before, but only discovered today that for 1 egg and an order of rye toast, they charge $6.95, which is outrageous, in my opinion. Oh - and two slices of tomorrow - which I  didn't order but happily ate."}
{"text":"Food doesn't taste good. Fries is super hard,dry, and cold. Omelette is lacking taste.  Service is not bad, but we won't come here again."}
{"text":"Solid, greasy spoon Breakfast DINER.  We all need A place like this. Unpretentious, attentive friendly wait staff and cook/owner. 

You will not find eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, but you are hungover and this is your cure!

SOLID four stars"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a good old-fashioned, greasy diner meal and Good Bite does not disappoint.

The place looks like it hasn't been renovated in decades and the staff is all at retirement age. It's fantastic.

I decided to go with the corned beef hash. I was asked how I wanted the eggs cooked (overeasy, always overeasy) and if I wanted white or brown toast (obviously white).

The food arrived impressively fast and was clearly fresh off the grill. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash itself was delicious (although I could've used a few more crispy bits). The accompanying home fries were just so-so, but they were much improved with a little ketchup.

Good Bite'll never be mistaken for gourmet fare, but it does what it does exceedingly well."}
{"text":"Good Bite definitely is what you would call an old school, diner type of restaurant.  Comfy booths and your typical old but kind waitress working the tables.  No frills/fuss comes to mind with extremely reasonable prices.  

My flight came into insanely early so we went to get a bite to eat.  We were the only ones there on a Monday morning (7am) but the two working there were friendly and greeted us immediately.  Apparently, this place is great for souvlakis but only breakfast menu (7-11:30am) was available at that time.  

We ordered:
- 2 eggs with sausage ($7.95) - ordered eggs over-easy which were done nicely.  Dish also came with home fries (potatoes) and two pieces of bread (buttered).  Surprisingly, everything was tasty and not overly greasy.  Definitely hit the spot for both of us.
- 3 eggs with sausage ($8.95) - my buddy pretty much had the same with the extra egg.  He devoured his dish before you could blink.

Anyways, I'm not the biggest fan of breakfast joints but this one fit the bill. Fast service, friendly staff and cheaaaap dishes.  They also had several different omeletes, pancakes and french toast on the menu if they typical eggs/bacon/ham/sausage doesn't catch your eye."}
{"text":"After too much vodka last night, I crawled out of bed and went straight to Good Bite.  Good thing I am a morning person and arrived early (8:45 or so) because I managed to score a booth.  By the time that I left an hour later, the place was rocking and there were 4 or 5 people waiting in line for tables.

This is a standard greasy diner which has been in the area for decades.  For $11 (including tax and tip) I had 2 fried eggs, peameal bacon, home fries, toast, and bottomless coffee.  The breakfast menu is pretty straight forward with just a few variations of the standard breakfast (such as what I ordered), plus a good selection of omelettes, and your basic pancakes and french toast offerings.  My breakfast was hot and tasty, greasy but not overly so, and there was so much of it that I left stuffed.  I also was impressed that my food was sitting in front of me less than 10 minutes after ordering. 

Unlike nearby Mars Uptown Diner (probably Good Bite's only serious competition in the area), the service was actually friendly and unhurried.  Although the coffee cups are small, I never saw the bottom!  A tip for you though - they do not bring you a bill - go to the front to pay when you're ready."}
{"text":"Have passed by this place numerous times over the years - it stands out from all the expensive restaurants and chic shops in the area. It's a greasy spoon that serves your usual greasy spoon staples like breakfast and burgers.

A pal and I were going to go for breakfast at another resto down the street, but they weren't open yet (and wouldn't be open for another thirty minutes). As a result, we decided to walk around and look for a place that we could go into right away. We were seated right away in a booth; it's not too big and seating is probably limited to 40 people max. I had the corned beef omelette with whole wheat toast and tea. For $10, I was pretty impressed with the amount of food I got. As for the quality/taste, I would definitely say that it's a-ok; it won't be the last meal on earth for me, but it also wasn't terrible. Service was pretty good; and the food came out quickly.

Good for: cheap eat, breakfast, lunch"}
{"text":"For what you pay I don't think it is worth the price.
Just some simple breakfast options that can be basically made at home with pre-made sausages or other breakfast items (as they use pre-made stuff no house made).
Just your typical breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today, and got 2 eggs and corned beef hash. My toast was absolutely flooded with margarine, just gross. The eggs were fine, nothing to complain about. The corned beef hash was tasty, with a pretty generous portion. As a rather ordinary breakfast, there was nothing to make me very disappointed, until I realized how much I was paying for it!!!! Almost 13 bucks for all that! Overestimated my expectation! To end on a good note, the atmosphere is amazing with friends, the old fashion diner is unique!"}
{"text":"Being new to the city, I had a couple of friends mention this place a couple of days ago. The service was quick and extremely friendly. They weren't too busy when I arrived so they let me sit anywhere I wanted to. I had the all day breakfast which was great. I will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"For the price, the souvlaki dinner is a disappointment. The souvlaki was dry and there was no sauce on the salad for some reason (bottle of sauce provided separately). I would probably go with some of the other choices on the menu next time I come.

Service is good, but the food is a little slow for larger groups. It's also very hard to seat a larger group sometimes too because of the small size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I found Good Bite Restaurant while searching for a good, classic diner in Toronto. The burgers, strawberry milkshake, and prices are all pretty good, but the fries were nothing special and the poutine gravy tasted very unusual.

Not a bad diner at all, but on the other hand, I'm not terribly eager to go back."}
{"text":"This is just a classic greasy spoon diner breakfast place. If you want fancy waffles or eggs benedict this is not the place. Here you will find simple greasy cheap and fast food  Nothing special but not terrible either. Weak coffee."}
{"text":"If I wrote mystery novels instead of Yelp reviews, and I were the hereo; say, a disgruntled ex-lawyer or crusty private eye, I would use the Good Bite diner as a frequent scene for rendez-vous with dirty cops, damsels in distress, and maybe the odd suspect or two. 

It's pretty much an archetypal diner: brutally lit, enrobed in green vinyl, with sour-faced servers who peddle decently burnt coffee and eggs fried just past the requested over easy. Service is quick, if not friendly; a laminated menu pressed into your hand nd a slighlty chipped mug slammed down in front of you before you spit out the '...fee\" in \"coffee\". 

Come for the show more than the food; the ancient cook at front sweating over the flat-top, narrowly avoiding extra saline in the home fires (which aren't bad, when they're not underdone--stick with french fries). If you arrive before the place opens, you might even catch him bumming a smoke at the stove. 

Bacon is delightfully crisp; sausages pleasently plump; toast is industrial, but comes slathered in butter. The whole joint sets you back about 10 bucks. A club sandwich is good, solid food. A burger no better or worse than you'd get anywehre else in the city. 

But as a place to bring your favourite Kellerman, Patterson or Connelly mystery and enjoy a cup or five, it's great."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the neighbourhood for breakfast or brunch. You can't go wrong with any of their breakfast choices. It's cheap, tasty and the service is super friendly. What more can one wish for? You've got to check out this place if you're in the neighbourhood and craving some comfort food. I doubt you'll be disappointed ;)"}
{"text":"Your local mom and pop diner with a nice retro feel to it. Booths throughout and stools at the counter.

Extensive breakfast and brunch menu. We ordered sandwiches as it was close to lunch. We both had the soup of day which was a lentil soup. The Grilled cheese with bacon was sadly made with kraft singles cheese. I was recommended the bacon, tomato sandwich, which was pretty good but small.  The slices were the size of Wonder bread slices. It was affordable but portions were small. The service was very fast."}
{"text":"The Good Bite is a classic diner that looks like a snapshot of the mid 20th century that continues to satisfy. They stick to diner fare, and do it quite well.

Now, I'm not much of a breakfast food person. For me, breakfast is either cold cereal, cold yogurt or cold leftovers. However, The Good Bite does diner lunch quite well.

My personal favourite is the club sandwich. Coming in at only $9.95 (3 decker sandwich plus a generous side of fries), it is a good deal too. It features real, cold , roasted turkey breast instead of deli-sliced turkey breast-ish roll. It also features crisp bacon and iceberg lettuce and thick, never mealy tomato slices. Mayo arrives on the side. The accompanying fries, although frozen, are freshly dropped to order and always come out crispy. 

The service is also excellent. As soon as you arrive, you take your seat, and almost before you land on the green bench or stool, you will have cutlery, a menu and a glass of water which you will rarely, if ever, see empty. The servers are extremely friendly and attentive. When you're done, you simply go up to the register and pay.

The Good Bite, ultimately is simple diner done right, and if you know what to expect (not Kobe beef, or infused anything) you'll definitely enjoy it!"}
