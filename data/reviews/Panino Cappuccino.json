{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's fantastic, me and boyfriend eat here all the time. Pasta is cooked perfectly and the sauces are delicious. Pizza is made in a wood burning oven and taste exactly the same as how they make it in Italy. Amazing."}
{"text":"A great restaurant for authentic Italian fare located in the last place you'd think. I've been here multiple times, sometimes for a lunch or relaxed dinner. I think the price-point is fair and on par with other solid Italian places. Have always received consistent and attentive service here. 

Food wise it's a great menu; lots of selection. I always try to get something different each time I dine here, and haven't been disappointed with anything yet, but when in doubt I go for the pizza. I never worry about leaving hungry because the portions are decently sized. 

One star off for it's location, surroundings can seem a little sketch at times but nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"Amazing Calamari and phenomenal home made pasta with mushrooms, amazing dish called Gemilli Funghi. Definitely will be back 1000% ~ highly recommend this restaurant!! A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in an odd spot. Menu selections are all good and worth trying. This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. I have been here many times for lunch."}
{"text":"Do not let the plaza fool you. An intimate, casual, and romantic environment. We got Calamari and Bruschetta for appetizers that tasted AMAZING! 

This is where they lost 2 stars ; 
We had ordered Pasta when we ordered our appetizers. Unfortunately our server realized 45minutes later we were not eating . . . then tried to lie to us and tell us the kitchen was backed up even though there were only 3 to 4 tables in the restaurant! It made no sense. A manager never came to talk to us either.

We ended up paying for our drinks and appetizers...and would like to come back because their food is amazing plus it is so conveniently located. You must give it a try just...do not expect prompt service amongst staff"}
{"text":"This is a cute little Italian restaurant practically in the middle of a neighbourhood. The food and service here is always great, and my friends and I love stopping in every once in awhile because it is such a convenient and quality spot to grab a bite to eat. I have had the pasta and the spinello, and have loved them both. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite Italian restaurant in town. Over the years of going there and having events we have gotten to know the head chef Charles. Not only is he a fantastic chef who always surprised us with new specials, but he is a very accommodating and compassionate man. When my grandfather was in the hospital he refused payment from my grandma and even sent her home with a pizza to alleviate her from cooking that day. Every time someone asks for an Italian restaurant, I always recommend Panini Cappuccino."}
{"text":"This is a true gem. I have been going here for 11 years now, and every time I go I order the same thing :'D but I have every now and then tried something new and I was never disappointed. The chefs in the back really work hard to deliver delicious Italian food. 
They service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and well decorated. I only wish they had more washrooms, or one for men and one for women.
Their gnocchi is second best... After nonnas of course ;)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here several years ago, and was craving pasta.  We popped in to get takeout about half an hour before closing. We were greeted by a charming server who took our order promptly and delivered it piping hot in about 15 minutes. Spring rolls were a beautiful and tasty surprise! We devoured our gnocchi in rose sauce and penne alla vodka without complaint. Panino Cappuccino did not disappoint. Next time we'll sit in for dinner."}
{"text":"Panino Cappucino, buon appetito! Nom nom nom!

Thank you previous reviewers - you were well on point when you said the food was fabulous here. I doubted you when the service started off slow but, man, did it finish with a bang!

I usually like to order a fresh soup before a meal but I was informed they don't normally offer soups until the winter season. Ok. But whatever disappointment I temporarily felt quickly dissipated once we started devouring the Italian Spring rolls our server had recommended instead of a soup. Well, who needs soup?!? My angry growling stomach became much friendlier after sharing those four crispy Italian spring rolls loaded with bocconcini cheese, proscuitto, roasted red pepper, and basil dipped in a balsamic vinegar redux. I just might upgrade from my devotion to open-ended egg rolls for this sophisticated roll. Yum!

There weren't any meatballs on the menu so I was a bit unsure of how to appease my need for good Italian tomato-y comfort food. Thankfully I opted for the daily special, the Ravioli, and when this dish came into view it was love at first sight! You see, I couldn't rely on the crutch of previous Panino Cappucino food porn since no one had uploaded any photos so I was taking a bit of a gamble that Yelp has shielded me from doing for some time - but the gamble paid off. Both my Beef ravioli and my friend's Penne Rustica with chicken smelled and tasted delicious. The Penne dish was an all around enjoyable dish that I would recommend to anyone craving a lightly flavored, heavier cream sauce with their pasta - it's a safe bet. The Beef Ravioli is perfect if you're looking for a zesty home-cooked tomato sauce and miniature bite-sized morsels of meat crammed inside al dente pasta. I was pleasantly surprised that this joint had better Italian fare than La Vecchia. If you want sexy ambience and decent italian, go to la vecchia, if you want that real authentic Italian taste - you come here :) And clearly someone agrees because this little family-owned restaurant received the award for best restaurant in North York in 2008, I believe. I will note just as an FYI that the overall \"feeling\" of the restaurant is relaxed, familiar and a bit intimate. Apparently, many family friends are regulars here and I suspect they have been trying to keep this great place all to themselves hehe. Lighting is a bit dim & tables in the back are a bit more private so you can enjoy a good date here as well...

While there were a few hiccups here and there, I can say again that the service overall was very good. Our server was charming, funny, accommodating and personable - again, another difference in comparison to my recent visit to La Vecchia. Service is great and super attentive at La Vecchia but lacks \"it\" - that unique personal touch to service that helps make the experience and diner-vendor rapport that much memorable. Good food, good conversation, good company, a little knowledge shared about Italian cuisine, Portugal, Burt Reynolds' cocktail, breakfast faves and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies = an excellent night for sure. Thank you, Robert. Also, shoutout to the chef who was incredibly engaging and informative. He was the Panino Cappucino version of that chef in the movie \"Last Vacation\" - taking pride in every dish, eager to inspire our palates with fresh & authentic dishes he encouraged us to indulge, happy to help us along our foodie journey through unexplored Italian territory!! He saved us from leaving the restaurant without sampling the Nutella semifreddo even though I had insisted on ordering the mixed berry flavor. Both flavours tasted absolutely deliciously & refreshing while also helping to digest the slight food coma I had growing in my belly. I would take this dessert delicacy over gelato, frozen yogurt or ice cream any day (even a DQ cookie dough blizzard and that's saying alot!). The server recommended we taste their famed coconut pie next time. We celebrated the great time with shots of La Grappa (another thing to cross of my list of \"things to try\") and left just before the kitchen closed at 10.

If you're in the area, and even if you're not, it's worth making the trek out to check out this \"hidden gem\" of North York. Don't drive too fast or you might miss it!"}
{"text":"Had their seafood pasta, it was pricey but it was really good and a BIG portion. Basically two meals in one. So I was pretty satisfied. 
Staff is very friendly and service is good! I came around the time they took their last calls for food and they were very accommodating to that."}
