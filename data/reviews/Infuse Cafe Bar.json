{"text":"I had their London Fog variation (forget the name) and it was delightful. The set up is a bit cramped but that's because it's a smaller shop. We went late and had seats but I imagine they might run out quickly. It had a good playlist at the time giving a nice ambiance but that is dependent on who sets it. It is definitely worth checking out if you are a tea buff. The way they infuse the leaves and water is interesting but that novelty will wear off, moreso if you are rushing. You'd be returning simply because they have good tea and a large selection.   Tl:dr large selection of flavourful teas (and coffee), infuser is interesting but will upset impatient people, good ambience in a smallish venue"}
{"text":"Exceptionally friendly place.  As they explained,  they use \"reverse press\" technology to extract all the flavors,  and it seems to work -  teas are out of this world!  Also if you like Japanese cheesecake you should try their new home made version of it.   Place is usually quiet with plenty of tables and good for a quiet date or private conversation."}
{"text":"The servers here are so great, they're the ones that make the cafe stand out from others. I've so far only tried a tea, a coffee and a shake but they've all been amazing. It's also a great place to study if it's not too busy.  If you're not sure, come once with your vicinity card, and your se cond drink will be free!"}
{"text":"Hidden Valley Coconut Milk Tea is absolutely incredible, can't get enough of that coconut flavor. The staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful in helping me decide what to try, and the Cheesecake is a perfect compliment to the drinks. They also have a great selection of teas that they sell loose leaf so I picked up some to try to brew at home. Hopefully it will come out just as good. Definitely coming back to try some more of their milk teas, I just love that they use real milk and tea no powders. I hate the powder taste I get from other tea shops."}
{"text":"After passing by this cafe everyday on my way to and from school, I finally decided to check it out. I was greeted by the most friendly barista ever who took the time to explain was Infuse was all about, and then helped me decide which beverage I wanted to try. I ended up getting a 12 oz iced citrus spritzer (I think that's what it is called) and I loved it!!!!!! It was so flavourful and not watered down, like iced teas are at other places (*cough* sbux *cough*). I will definitely be back for more of their teas, their coffee and their cakes!   It also looked like a nice place to study (nice music, WiFi, ample space) :)  ---------------- I finally got to try their ice cream sandwich coffee and it is definitely my new summer drink! Thank you Infuse for never letting me leave disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been anywhere where they described their coffee making process in such detail and paid so much care to the quality of their product and customer experience.   A++++++ would go here again. Next time I will try their teas. The coffee is fantastic and their bkon machines are super cool."}
{"text":"This cafe is a must try! Even though it's fairly new I've been here a few times already. Everything I've tried so far is soo yummy and flavourful.   If you like iced teas they have the BEST ones I`ve ever tried! I also tried the mango shake and that was very yummy as well. If you like your coffee strong you should definitely try theirs, I had their signature coffee and it tasted very bold and I loved it with the condensed milk.  Seeing my drink made in the machine they have was very cool, I've never seen anything like that before. They told me they are the only ones to have this machine in Canada, and these special machines are what makes the drinks so flavourful.  This cafe has a really good tea selection and it's all organic which makes me love this place even more! I will definitely be back to try their other drinks!"}
{"text":"I went there today, their tea is really amazing. If looking for iced tea, order the Tropical Crimson.   Staff is very friendly and nice :) Loved this place."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese coffe I've ever had in Toronto so far.  They have this vacuum infusion process that makes the coffee taste smoother. less burned taste. The tea tastes very good too, strong taste, not bitter at all - It's made with the same vacuum process.  You get better quality products for a cheaper price than Fivebucks(trademark)."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the store was clean and inviting with nice tea aroma around the store. I got the signature coffee and the classic cheese cake.  The coffee was flavorful and strong. The coffee isn't burn and the cheesecake was light and fluffy.  It was my first taste of Japanese cheese cake and it was great, light and fluffy."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service.  I got their Infused Signature coffee. It's $3.99 for a small (12 oz). It's sweetened with condensed milk, but not heavily creamy. You can still taste the bold coffee flavour. Personally, I don't appreciate coffee as much as coffee fanatics, so the bold taste didn't sit so well with me, but I imagine coffee addicts would enjoy this more. Still, it's good coffee and even better service.  Starbucks makes an attempt to connect with their customers by name but I doubt any barista actually remembers the name after writing it on the cup (let's be real, they get it wrong half the time anyway). At Infuse, the barista truly take the time to get to know their customers and tell them about their coffee. You can really tell that they're passionate about coffee and the special coffee brewers they use. As I was waiting for my coffee, the barista called me over by name, asked if it was my first time there, and suggested that I watch them brew my coffee so I could see the special methods they use. I was impressed. Definitely a great alternative to the standard coffee/tea shops in the area"}
{"text":"I went to there Gerrard Square store recently and noticed they have an Infuse Tea club now that gives 40% off all Loose Leaf Tea! Best of all its free to join!  Organic Tea cheaper than every other tea shop including David's Tea!"}
{"text":"Very bad coffee experience..  A few people had ordered coffee around 6-ish pm(10Feb)   and were sitting around, talking, reading, surfing.. Some 15 minutes later we got the boot:  \" We have to kick you guys out because the place has been booked for an evening function\"     (?!??)  Funny thing is, just minutes earlier, when we ordered their expensive (but so-so coffee), no staff had  the decency to warn the customers that we couldn't stay long that evening - BEFore we bought anything on the store.   Nor any of the employees(&owner?) showed any sense of honesty of, at least, making a gesture to return our money or offering a coupon or sth.. (and no one asked - it should have come from them).     Now, I come to TO quite often and have had many great experiences on other independent coffee shops in town, where one can sit down, relax, read, talk, without been pressured to leave the premises.  If this is the way Infuse treats some of its customers, how can it build loyalty?  Not worth spending time & (lot of) money on this place for such poor customer treatment."}
{"text":"A local tea shop that has won my heart and loyalty forever.   Okay, so the cafe itself needs some work. Their chairs are cheap, the floors are old, but the drinks make up for all of it. The bonus small collection of board games is a plus and the cafe has got a decent seating capacity for small groups to chill :)  SOOO they use this technology called RAIN (?) that basically sucks out all the air from the tea leaves while it is steeping and is supposed to extract more flavour from the leaves. Cool technology, not sure how much of a role it plays vs traditional steeping (I have yet to buy their loose leaf for my own home), but so far each drink has been bomb.   I've tried their: Hidden Coconut Valley Milk Tea (iced), Creamy Vanilla Bean Milk Tea (hot), Scarlet Rose (iced), Orange blossom (hot), and the wild hibiscus berry (cold). All these drinks have stayed true to their name giving you an experience that translates well from the smell of the loose leaf to the taste of the drink itself. These guys are true masters of tea making and if you appreciate tea as much as I do, save your money at Starbucks and come here. They won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cafe! The service is friendly and the drinks are to die for. I always get the Scarlett Rose and Fruit Sensation tea and it's always made with perfection. Love the service from Simon and Andy!"}
{"text":"They have many many options of fresh teas. And they're all so delicious! And they look beautiful too.  There is plenty of seating and wifi. It's a great alternative to a coffee shop for studying or work.  I keep coming back here, because of their many delicious options, reasonable prices, and friendly attitudes."}
{"text":"Amazing place .. tried signature coffee and cake . Very clean place and very nice staff."}
{"text":"The matcha and masala tea are my favorite. This is the first time I had infused tea. I need to find that Sam spot in Vegas. If your in Toronto and around the area, try their teas. You'll love the flavors!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a date.  We went there on Monday night and we had amazing cocktails.  The bartender/owner is very attentive and the ambience was super nice and relaxing.  Definitely recommend this bar and coming back again with friends!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice vibes, great cocktails, and amazing service - I'm looking forward to frequent Infuse more often in both the day for the cafe and night for the bar!  Came here on a Thursday night and it wasn't super busy, which was nice. It has a jazzy ambience, with candle-lit tables and great background music. We did group therapy and got Summertime Spanks, which I highly recommend! It's the perfect level of sweet, fruitiness, and alcohol. We also got a mashed potato side to share, which they served with lime aioli sauce (it was really average). Although unsure about the rest of the menu, I would definitely come back for the drinks and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I went in today and got the Tropical Crimson, which seems to be very popular among Yelp reviewers who've visited Infuse. The drink was nice and refreshing.   There's free wifi in the store (ask for the password) which is great! Oh and you can sign up for their rewards program in store and you'll get a free drink!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place because of their deal on groupon and ended up loving it. The servers at Infuse Cafe are super friendly and knowledgeable. It is one of those places that you want to go back to for amazing service, knowing that you will be greeted with big smiles. They have board games that you can use if you are bored. It is a great place to study/do work too. Their iced teas are very refreshing and they are not loaded with sugar like at other places. A perfect drink for a hot summer day. I have yet to try their hot drinks. They sometimes have delicious cookies on sale for very cheap too ($1-$2!).  Note: even though it is on Yonge street, it is quite easy to miss this place and walk by it. They should use more signs with lights to make the place more visible!"}
{"text":"Ordered an iced milk tea, and thoroughly enjoyed it while playing boardgames and catching up with old friends. Great little cafe tucked in the heart of Young & Dundas! The girl behind that counter was very helpful and kind. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the jasmine green with soy milk and was very pleased with it. It had a very strong jasmine scent which made this drink taste amazing since I love jasmine scented drinks. I love how they use organic loose leaves to make the drinks. Super friendly service. Will definitely be coming back to try other drinks here."}
{"text":"So I'll admit it, we are Melbourne (Australia) coffee snobs. We travel the world looking for great cafes, and this is one of them.  I chatted to the guys about their venue and their passion. These guys know their stuff and love a chat!!  The coffee they make is brilliant. They invested heavily in machinery that gets the most out of the beans. It tastes great.  Word to the wise, if you think Starbucks is good coffee, don't come here. This is actual coffee, made by professionals for lovers of the craft.  Make time to visit, it's with it!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened and always enjoy my time there. The staff are always super kind, and they have lots of interesting options. The tea is tasty (although I don't really understand their whole fancy infusing machine thing ... I don't really notice the difference). I really appreciate that they use so many organic certified tea brands, and that is one of the many reasons I come back a lot.  They have been trying to increase the snacks available as before they only had tea. For a while they had reasonably priced Japanese cheesecake. Then they had very cheap small snacks such as brownies that were baked as a side business by one of their employees, which I thought was a sweet way to support small business in more than one way. It would be nice to have healthier options as well.  There are also a few board / card games and some books / zines / comics, including by locals which is a nice touch.    The wifi is a bit hit and miss. They do have some plugs though which is great if you're going there to work."}
{"text":"I am a huge coffee fan. If I could drink only coffee everyday and not die I probably would. If i had to drink only one type of coffee forever it would be the mocha coffee from Infuse. I don't know what kind of sorcery they use with their brewing system but they have got me hooked on it.   The brewer/infuser is like something out of a sci-fi movie. You have to see it in action for yourself for sure. it's mesmerizing!   The staff here are also some of the nicest people. They are truly passionate about what they are crafting up and you can tell. If you're in the area drop in and see how their magical teas and coffees are made."}
{"text":"This place is so comfy! I love the ambiance and friendly staff. Good place if you just need to chill and casual drink. Mmmm cheese cake is always good here! Loving those fruity drinks! The owner is pretty cool guy, he came to our table and said hi and gave us the specials lol will for sure recommend to all my friends.  - siuwun"}
{"text":"Sometimes life gets you down and the only two things you need are tea or alcohol. Well, look no further because at Infuse you get both of those under one roof, in one drink! I was drawn to Infuse because of their large selection of tea infused cocktails, featuring drinks ranging from fruity and refreshing to more potent drinks like the Old Fashioned. The servers are really great here about making sure you order a drink that fits your desired flavor profile - they'll ask you a series of questions about what you like in a drink & then recommend the best drink from the menu for you. It's the kind of attention that you just don't get at more bustling bars and cafes in Toronto.   I ended up getting the Peach Riot, which is a peach white tea based cocktail with gin. Oh my, I was not expecting how boozy this would be! It's seriously a tea cocktail that wakes you up just the right amount. As you sip away, you grow accustomed to it and start tasting the tea infused which to me was a pretty cool experience. I'm not a tea or cocktail connoisseur but am a fan of this unique concept!   Their matcha white chocolate cake is also fantastic - soft but definitely flavorful. You get all the great taste of matcha without any of the bitter aftertaste.   The place is pretty dim with candles in the evening, a nice place for a date or to catch up with friends. From the outside, I'd never think of coming here but I'm so glad I did!"}
{"text":"Delicious signature iced coffee. Very aromatic! Can request for 50, 100, 150% sugar. Also tried a sample of peach iced tea. Strong peach flavour and very refreshing on this hot day!"}
{"text":"I've been in love with Infuse Cafe ever since it opened. Their teas are full of flavour thanks to their unique brewing method. Plus, the service is always top notch and super friendly. After being closed for a lengthy renovation, they're back open and they've added alcoholic drinks to the menu. My friend and I went to check it out and the place looks WAY better. The interior design used to be rather bland, but there are new tables and booths; the decor just looks more unique. The lighting is dimmer, but also more cozy.    In terms of the new menu, they offer a lot of unique cocktails inspired by different tea varieties. My friend got the Mango Mai Tai and I got the Peach drink (I forget what it was called exactly). Overall, we both enjoyed our drinks a lot! Mine included peach blossom white tea and had a nice, lemony aftertaste.   I also saw that they offer super cheap steak and sides, which was quite a surprise. For my next visit, I'll definitely be trying out more of their food and dessert options. Overall, I'm so glad Infuse is open again!"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about infuse cafe, everything is just very main stream. The teas which are the highlight here taste the same as tea/iced-tea you can get at Starbucks. They just have a fancy infuser which make it seem cool but the credit for that should be given to the infuser manufacturer. The service is great and quick, however the seating area is limited. Not a good place to have a private conversation."}
{"text":"A sleek and artsy Cafe with board games. I ordered a regular hot house coffee which was so so. My friend ordered an ice infuse signature coffee which was cold and sweet in a good way (not watered down). Barista was very friendly and knowledgable. Would come back for the games and to try other drinks."}
{"text":"Their customer service is beyond excellent. He let us smell the tea before we chose our drink. However.. Ordering a milk tea here was not the best idea. He said they use this type of milk, I can't recall what kind (I think evaporated milk, but don't quote me on that).. But it was not the best..I believe I got the London fog milk tea, maybe should've omitted the milk part. It tasted weird, I guess being a bubble tea fanatic, I was expecting something similar. So order with caution if you think you're getting a bubble tea-like drink, you're not. Just get regular tea with no milk, oh and get something probably fruity."}
{"text":"I went in looking for free WiFi and stumbled upon some of the best cocktails I've come across in Toronto!   So, like I said, Yelp indicated, \"Infusion,\" was a good place to set up with a laptop and do some work. Technically, accurate, but should specify this is more of a weekday thing. By evening, the place picks up and it's such a small intimate venue that you would kind of be a jerk taking up laptop space. Not that the staff would ever make you feel that way, everyone who works there must love their job because they are so welcoming, helpful, patient, and knowledgeable about the menu....  Which is quite unique. I usually cringe at the idea of tea cocktails, because I'm usually served an artificially flavored tea spirit that feels like a chore to finish. That's not what this place offers.  These cocktails are unique and inspired and they are brewing and infusing the drinks on premise with some amazingly creative combinations and a deft hand.  I tried the Valley Girl (Club Soda, Kettle One Vodka, Fresh Lime Juice, Fruit Sensation tea syrup, Creme De Violette), and it was absolutely delicious and refreshing, but I moved on as it was a little too easy to drink without realizing you are chugging booze, plus, I still wanted to try basically everything else on the menu.  I also had the, \"Straight Cash\" (Orange Blossom Green Tea, Cachaça, Ginger Lime Rooibos Tea Syrup, Lime disc, Chilli Pepper), which was by far my favourite (those afraid if heat have nothing to fear, I'm sure they'd kick it up for you, but going from maybe one of the sweetest (but, not cloyingly so, and lightest drinks on the menu, I was completely unphased by the spice level, and fell in love instantly).   There was another drink somewhere in there I remember enjoying, haha, but it was the \"Straight Cash,\" that stole the show, and it will be hard for me not to order straight away the next time I make it in, despite there still being so many tempting drinks on the menu I want to sample.  I found everyone very attentive to myself and another solo soon to be pal (rare for two social female drinkers to hit a bar solo, but this was exactly the kind of place we felt welcome and at ease) - picking up on what our personal tastes were and nailing it with their suggestions.   They were also really adept and courteous when dealing with a slightly rowdier table of young \"gentlemen\" who felt closing time was a \"suggestion,\" that they could take or leave. (This is not a \"rowdy\" place, but handling last call can always take some finesse.)  At the end of the night, when I went to cash out, I discovered the extremely knowledgeable gentleman who had helped me most of the evening was also the owner. Made sense. This is exactly the kind of place you get when someone is doing something they love, and love to share, but are not pretentious or overly obtrusive in introducing you to their passion (the best of Williamsburg without the posturing). I'm s#*@ for names, but shout out to, we'll go with, \"John?,\" and the rest of the crew for nailing it!  Sorry, I can't give details on the menu, guess the need for an update is a good excuse to make another stop in!"}
{"text":"I love love love this tea shop. My go-to is the cold vanilla bean milk tea. I honestly don't know how to describe the taste because it's so different than anything I've ever tried before. I just know that it's amazing, and I feel like I'm in heaven when I order it."}
{"text":"Nice customer service and atmosphere. I enjoyed the toasted almond tea. The staff are very knowledgeable about the teas and were very patient in showing us teas that caught our interest."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my evening for a Yelp event at Infuse. Tried the Tropical Crimson and it was very smooth and refreshing. I definitely want to give their Signature Coffee a try and their matcha drink. A great spot to drop in for a catch up session or a break from shopping in the area. I'll probably go on a Monday to take advantage of the 30% off deal - for a limited time only! :)"}
{"text":"Infuse is pretty great! They got the most flavorful teas thanks to their really expensive fancy tea vacuum machines. Their black milk tea really keeps me awake. Im not a big coffee drinker myself, but I heard their coffee is delicious! Cheaper than the McDonalds right beside them too. Theres wifi to work, and you can ritual if you wanna just do a quick pick up in the morning.  The prices for teas are kinda expensive, but they have a student discount and usually a discount on Mondays."}
{"text":"I love infuse cafe, their service is super great. The tea is tasty and Match cake is vey fresh. The price is fair. The decoration is simple and cozy."}
{"text":"I came to Infuse Cafe on a Tuesday evening around 5:30 and there were quite a few people there! It's right across Ryerson and was slightly hidden. You have to keep an eye out for their sign above the door!  I had ordered the Iced Organic Jasmine Green Milk Tea ($3.38 after tax) and my friend ordered their Hot Classic Milk Tea.  I found my jasmine green milk tea to be really milk heavy, and wished I had more jasmine green tea flavour. I'm not saying there wasn't any jasmine green tea, just that the milk had over powered it. My friend agreed that her drink was also quite milky. The store used a special Bokr machine to brew the teas, which was interesting to watch. It was such a fancy gadget!  The prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most tea shops (i.e. Bubble tea shops and teavana) and I found the options to be quite extensive.  Although I did not fall in love with my drink, I would definitely consider coming back to try the different drinks. Their iced coffee smoothie looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Infuse Cafe is an independently owned tea cafe right across Ryerson's campus with a great selection of teas and caffeinated drinks. It has a clean minimal aesthetic - fairly spacious and brightly lit. It has free wifi and has a few small tables at the front; for me, it is a good place to study away from campus, read, meet up with a friend or two or have quiet time (been here a few times now, and the noise level is always moderate). I always a pleasant experience with the baristas, the service is great and they tend to remember me and my orders (I come by often enough hahaha). The way the tea is brewed is fascinating - like a science. You get to watch :) I've never tried a drink from Infuse that I haven't liked. I recommend their Wake Me Up coffee, peach ice tea & oolong tea. Anyway, Infuse is fairly low-key & I love it because it's not crowded or pretentious; such a gem!"}
{"text":"When you can't decide, just have both! This is what this cafe is all about: enjoying an alcoholic beverage without compromising on your enjoyment of tea.  They boast a full tea cocktail menu under their belt, and there's even a non-alcohol drink menu if you wanna keep things pg-13. With the use of infusers, the tea they use has a smoothness akin to juice, so it's definitely a novelty that you'll want to add to your bucket list of things to try.  Combined with spirits and other ingredients, your tea cocktail will be stronger in flavour and smoothness and will even be seemingly gentler on the stomach than conventional cocktails. That being said, I definitely recommend everyone to try their drinks.  Priced affordably, you won't be breaking the bank.  Plus, even if what you're craving for doesn't exist on the menu, you'll find something uniquely yours (the bartender loves customizing and creating unique drinks upon request). Drink away my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is friggin awesome! I came here last night for a yelp event. Was greeted by one of the lovely owner, got a chance to try their drinks. Yesterday they were offering: signature coffee which is their version of Vietnamese coffee! Absolutely delicious (did you know it takes them two weeks to make?!). This one was my fav along with their jasmine tea with evaporated milk which the owner made just for my friends and I that night :p. The other two drinks were apple cider and the tropical crimson that I liked better than the apple cider.   Also, after hearing about Cecilia's cheesecakes on Instagram... Found out that she sells them here at the cafe! So we also got to have some samples! And I can definitely say they're better than uncle tetsu. I love the matcha cheesecake especially.   All the staff at the store were super friendly and were very knowledgeable about what they do and I like that! We also got to hear how the business began so that was cool..and it made me want to support local businesses more! If only I work downtown then I'd totally visit a few times during the week. Overall, I hope they continue to do well and I'll definitely be coming back! Thanks for the coffee and tea infuse! #infusenation lol"}
{"text":"Love the teas. Also great place for chilling as well as studying while sipping on some delicious teas"}
{"text":"Ordered the tropical hibiscus and tried other teas as well. Extremely sour and too expensive for quality and taste. Layout is not friendly and wait for drinks is excessively long"}
{"text":"I had the incredible opportunity to come here for a yelp event and was blown away by their cocktails! The owners and bartenders were clearly passionate about their teas and cocktails. They use state of the art methods to infuse their teas and take the time to combine them with different wines and spirits to achieve the perfect cocktails.   I was able to try two of their group therapy cocktails: \"Sorry Not Sorry\" and \"Pinch Me Picasso\". Once you taste these, you will never go back to a basic sangria again. My favourite of the two was Sorry Not Sorry, which was a fruity red punch with red wine and tea. Pinch me Picasso was a pineapple juice with white wine and tea. Both of these drinks were very fruity and sweet and tasted delicious. You could barely taste the alcohol, and the tea was very fragrant. They make these cocktails in larger quantities, meant for sharing. They have 7 ounces of alcohol in them, so don't be fooled by the taste!   I also got to try two of the cocktails off of the sweet and refreshing menu: \"Jumanji Sour\" and \"Mango Mai Tai\". Jumanji Sour is one of the prettiest drinks I've ever seen! The final product is wrapped in a banana leaf and is very picturesque. They use a banana berry tea, which smells and tastes amazing, to amp up a traditional whisky sour. I had to try the Mango Mai Tai because I love mango everything and it didn't disappoint. They combined their s'mores tea with rum and the combination was delicious! You could definitely taste the 2 oz of rum in this one, but not in a bad way.   My boyfriend tried the Bullrider Express from the Spirit Forward menu, which he enjoyed, but it personally wasn't for me. It was a little too bitter for my liking, but I can see its appeal to coffee lovers!   As for the food, they serve very affordable sous vide steaks! I would highly recommend this place to people looking for date spots - especially those looking to impress on a first date but don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"I've officially become a regular at this place.  A couple updates: 1)  Get the Signature Coffee - It's their take on Vietnamese Coffee with sugar and cream already added in optimal ratios.  It's lit. 2)  Ken is an awesome barista, who's very helpful and gives great suggestions!"}
{"text":"This unpretentious cafe specializes in a range of infused, specialty teas, but delicious, dark roast coffee as well. This gem lies hidden in plain sight on Yonge St. It deserves much more love than it was getting on the bitterly cold Saturday afternoon when we stopped in."}
{"text":"Great tasting tea brewed by the bkon brewer. The staff were knowledgable and trying to teach customers about the tea and the brewer   Try the tropical mango."}
{"text":"Having been to both locations (other is Gerrard Square), I can comfortably conclude that I like this location more because:  1) free wifi (pw: silverneedle) 2) more seating (4-5 tables) 3) free boardgames 4) natural lighting/bright decor  5) if you post on social media with their hastag #infusenation, you will receive 10% off your next order!   Tonight, I had their Infuse Coffee, which is essentially a Vietnamese coffee. Since it is made with condensed milk, it is pretty sweet. If you don't have a sweet tooth, I'd ask them to go easy on the condensed milk; otherwise, it is pretty flippin' delicious! To top it all off, our barista tonight was such a charmer! Super fun to chat with while we waited for our drinks."}
{"text":"Their signature ice coffee was great! If you like Vietnamese drip coffee but don't want to wait, it is the perfect drink!"}
{"text":"Its a great cafe on Yonge and very different from the other tea shops around the area.  The first time I tried them out was at a Yelp elite event but I have been back several times afterwards.  They have a wide variety tea and coffee but their specialty is making tea with their expensive tea infusing system.  It was amazing to watch the tea leaves being used in the machine to make a unique tea experience. When I found out how much the machine was, it made me appreciate that if I wanted this special tea, I would come back.  Best of all, they have renovated their cafe slightly with more tables compared to the Yelp event plus offered a wide variety of games. My friends were there for over an hour close to closing and they did not rush us out.  They gently let us know that they were closing up but could stay a bit longer.  Definitively great customer service."}
{"text":"Nice dowtown coffee/tea shop. Staff is very friendly, they explained the whole idea of how ther male their drinks. A must try is their Matcha green cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I love infuse cafe, and it is so easy to access from the downtown core. It's a small-ish cafe, but it's never really packed which I appreciate for a nice and quiet workplace that doubles up as a 'coffice'  The staff that work here are adorably nice and sweet and they do an amazing job of recommending something perfect every time. I think their teas are so good - the rainy days call for a hot tea and the hot summer days are perfect for their iced teas. They have pretty unique offerings and their infuser/brewer machine sure as hell is unique .. I've never seen another like it in toronto!   They also use vicinity points, and I swear I haven't been there THAT much but I just got a free large tea.. anything I don't have to pay for, I'm down. Haha, no but seriously! This place is worth it! I just wish their drinks that contain dairy would have non-dairy options such as almond or soy milk. Also, my mind finds it so annoying that one of their few outlets are unaccessible because you would have to reach your cord across the middle of the pathway of patrons coming in and it just seems like a general inconvenience to even plug it in.. I ain't about to be responsible for a death that occurs in infuse because somebody tripped over my cord.  ** Update - they DO have non-dairy options!! Wish they'd told me this when I told them I couldn't drink milk. Will definitely try a latte next time. :D"}
{"text":"My God! It was such an enjoyable experience honestly. Went here for an yelp event and got a chance to hear the owner and the bartender talk about the place. And I could just feel the passion from them. They really understand their target market. For such a boujie place its honest very affordable and they try very hard to keep it that way. I will definitely be taking my friends back here. Very casual very fun. Cheers"}
{"text":"They use their super fancy expensive vacuum machine to brew their bold coffee.  It tastes very unique from other coffees.  Absolutely delicious.  You must try it!!!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of teas and other hot drinks. The barista was very knowledgeable and seemed truly passionate about their products and processes! Cute and cozy place."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday night, just to catch up with a friend somewhere quiet. The café is clean, the tea selection is interesting (less variety than a David's Tea or a Teavana, but still varied and delicious.) and the customer service is fantastic. I ordered an iced Ginger Lime Rooibos tea, and my friend ordered their S'mores tea.  It was my first visit, and Marianna (I hope that's the correct spelling) made me feel welcome and looked-after. I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"The jasmine green milk tea was probably one of the best I've had! It was milky and fragrant and not too sweet (at 50% sugar). They have a huge menu of iced and hot teas to try. The cafe itself is pretty big for a downtown cafe and had a few boardgames you could play at the front as well."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I went after hearing such good things about it and I was not disappointed.  The guy who I usually see working there is super nice and very helpful in suggesting different drinks for customers. They use BKON brewers which are quite cool to watch and also brings out great flavours in the tea. I also had a friend try the Signature Coffee and it was amazing (sort of like a HK milk tea version of coffee??).   Tip:They take their time making the drinks so if you want to just grab and go, order online through one of the apps they're connected with (I'm not sure which ones... Ritual? Grabb?) and that should save you some wait time.  Tip: They do Vicinity points..! it's only like $4 per every 9 drinks or something but still better than nothing."}
{"text":"Had what my friends gave me was amazing - looking for at to chill in store now - will post photos after but go check it out for yourself !;)"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times but just brushed it off as another knock off of Teavana or David's Tea and never really gave it a chance. I saw a friend of mine posted an article about this place from BlogTO and while I usually avoid following any recommendation from there, I was intrigued by their unique way that they infuse their teas. I decided to give them a try, and I'm now hooked.  I can't really explain what they do with the tea that's so unique - you'd have to ask the workers for the details, but the basic idea is that they put the tea leaves in some plastic tube, which continuously pumps the leaves in water which results in tea that has a strong flavour of tea - but no bitterness nor burnt aftertaste. After trying their tea from here, any other tea I've tried elsewhere just seemed watery in comparison. I had no idea tea was supposed to taste like that.  Their teas, along with their coffees, are on the slightly stronger side, so sometimes the caffeine can get to me a little too strong, but I just make sure I avoid this place at night (unless I'm pulling an all-nighter). From what I've ordered so far, I do prefer their teas over their coffee though, but I haven't tried their ice cream cake coffee, so that is still somewhat to be determined.  The place also isn't too popular so there's quite a bit of space available for you to sit and relax. A few people do work in there, and they also provide some board games which you can play for free. They also serve cakes, and I kid you not, their Japanese cheesecake is actually better than Uncle Tetsu with a creamier texture and a more cheesy taste, but it's not as aesthetically pleasing. It doesn't really matter though since it ends up in your stomach either way.  The one point of concern is the wait time. Right now I usually wait about 10-15 minutes to get my order, and that's with a relatively short line. I worry about how much longer the wait time is going to be as they become more popular in the area. They're restricted to two machines, so at max they can only really make two teas at once before they have to clean out the machine for the next drink. Hopefully they'll have some sort of system figured out by then.  All in all though, I highly recommend this place for all tea lovers and even those who enjoy bubble tea. No they don't offer tapioca, or jelly, or any of toppings for that matter, but think of their milk tea as something you'd order from a typical Hong Kong Cafe. It's milky, not too sweet, with a nice kick of tea. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service and awesome teas. They also have a cool process to making their teas."}
{"text":"I was delighted to be invited in to give Infuse another try. I do see some minor improvements to their decor including newly installed shelving to display their assortment of teas. Also, gone are the hideous glass tables with those funky chrome chairs. The giant mural on the wall has also been toned down significantly; And this all adds up to slight improvements to their aesthetic appeal. I can see they are making slight efforts in creating a more inviting space but I think they have ways to go; get rid of those tacky track lights!  Anyhow, I did not have the opportunity to try their coffee as their teas greatly overshadow any sort of coffee offering they may have. I say this as a compliment because their teas have been and still are very flavourful and excellent.  One thing I do want to mention though is the excellent service they provide time and time again. I must admit my previous review is a bit harsh but that's just how I am; I prefer the ugly truth over a pretty lie. As an avid reviewer, I am extremely humbled and happy to know that there are business out there like Infuse who are so invested in community reviews.  I think you guys have some great products and excellent service. I just wish you guys can house all that in a more inviting atmosphere however I do see that baby steps are being taken towards that. :)"}
{"text":"Upon entering, I was greeted by this friendly staff. She asked if it was my first visit and if I prefer coffee or tea. She then let me smell their selections.   I then placed an order, Infuse Signature Coffee where they used this really cool machine to make it, I was told there's only 40+ of these machines in North America.   While waiting for my coffee, we chatted about life, school and coffee machines lol. It was definitely fun to watch and it was nice she was trying to get to know her customers. I was asked to give them a shoutout so here I am.   So yeah, it was definitely an awesome experience at Infuse Cafe. Also, I got a 30% off because it's a Monday - double the awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and was intrigued enough to check it out. Upon approaching the counter, the barista asked us if we've ever come here before and proceeded to explain to us how their organic teas are brewed to order - pretty cool!  We ended up getting a tropical crimson iced tea, a cold london fog, and a slice of their matcha Japanese cheesecake. The iced tea was nice and refreshing - as the barista described, essentially their take on punch - and the london fog was very smooth and not overly sweet (I appreciated that they asked if I would like less sugar without me having to inquire). Matcha cheesecake was super yummy as well and a welcome deviance from the usual cakes and cookies typically found at coffee shops.  A cute, unique little tea shop that's a little hidden amidst the hustle and bustle of Yonge & Dundas. Go check it out though - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge tea drinker but after listening to my girlfriend praise this place for 2 years I figured I would give something on the menu a try! I was scanning over the options when I saw that this place had Italian Soda, which I absolutely needed in my life. I ended up ordering the soda with Fruit Sensation. I had no idea what to expect when I took my first sip but I was blown away! This was like a fruity club soda with a super refreshing taste. Overall, Infuse Cafe is a great little shop in the heart of Toronto. This place not only offers a ton of beverage options, it offers board games to play while you sit and enjoy that beverage. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Such a neat cafe with delicious tea and coffee.  Their brewing style is super unique and really changes the flavors for the better.  You get some really rich and thorough flavors out of tea and the Thai Iced Tea Coffee (I think that's what I had...) was super good.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Both the coffee and tea were fantastic and the people working here were SO friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Okay their classic milk tea is soooooooooooo good holy cow. Definitely try it if you like strong tea flavour :)"}
{"text":"If you love tea this is the place for you. It's quieter than places like Cha time. You can actually study here. There is a down side though, the door at the front is broken and is always left slightly ajar so cold wind will blow inside. You can close the door yourself but it gets annoying. As for teas, try the jasmine milk tea if you're a fan of HK style milk tea! Minus one star for the annoying door."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of coffee and tea, this cafe is a hidden gem. I ordered their jasmine tea latte and it tasted delicious.The flavour of the tea really came through without the burnt taste which is found in teas that have been steeped too long. They also have a unique way to brew the tea and I was intrigued by their brewing machine. Definitely something to see, it's different and new to Canada, the staff mentioned. They are also friendly and knowledgable. The atmosphere is really relaxing and quiet. Perfect for studying or reading."}
{"text":"Went there for their grand opening and they were giving out samples of ice tea and ice coffee. All the ones we tried were amazing. Would definitely recommend for anyone who is a tea drinker to try how their cool machines infuse the tea and make it more flavorful. I wish I could get one for my home."}
{"text":"Great tea and great staff that keeps me coming back! Shoutout to Andy for being so friendly and helpful. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is unlike anything else that exists in Toronto (which they openly boast about) as it offers a full menu of TEA COCKTAILS...and not just your grandmas shot in her evening tea! ;)   This place recently had a facelift and it looks super hipster and minimalist inside with their wall plants and neon sign. The bartender is nightclub promoter turned mixologist. The drinks are tasty, but he definitely does not do well with the stress of a busy bar, because he became frazzled and short. As someone who has worked in the industry, I totally get that this is something that happens to all human beings, but it's definitely something to note as Toronto has a tendency to run through businesses, and this definitely soured the experience. Luckily, shoutout to Josh (the gentleman who took our order and helped do general floor business) was charming, kind and very approachable and was the face of what good service should be.    The cocktails are DELICIOUS! I don't know whether it was the tea (that tastes like juice), or just really great cocktails in general, but they are a big win for this place! They don't have the ridiculous Toronto prices too, at most cocktails running about $12. They have really turned the drink experience into a craft focusing on presentation, smell and taste. The food is good, but definitely not sometime I would come back for.   I will definitely be back to try more of their drinks and maybe even a tea or two (sans adult sauce!)"}
{"text":"Infuse Café is located in an unassuming spot that I've clearly walked by dozens of times (but have never even noticed). It's soooo much bigger inside, and you're greeted instantly by a helpful cashier who will walk you through the process if it's your first time there!  The menu is diverse and full of options, so there's probably a drink that will suit even the pickiest of palates. The drinks take a bit of time to make, but it's totally worth the wait. I'm not too familiar with the process, but the brewed iced coffee is so delicious! I got the signature iced coffee, which is perfectly sweet and milky with just the right kick of bitter caffeine.   It's a relaxing place to study, hang out with friends, connect with strangers or just to chill out for a few hours. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other drinks!    PS They use Vicinity for rewards!"}
{"text":"Great service and drinks! Walked by here and decided to stop by looking for a study space. Was greeted by a friendly server who was very helpful and explained their infused tea concept clearly with great explanations and recommendations.   They also have a whole shelf of tea samples for customers to smell before deciding what to order and the server provides aroma samples as well.   The space is cozy and a little cramped but was perfect for us as it wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon.   We decided to try the iced milk tea options (s'mores and classic) and was expecting it to be warm and watered down as they infuse the tea to order using their \"bnok\" technology and adding ice afterwards. To my surprise it was the contrary, as the tea was flavourful and perfectly balanced with the amount of bitterness and sweetness. You can really taste the difference in the tea compared to the regular bubble tea drinks as it's not flavoured by syrups or powders but within the tea itself.  Would definitely come back for another visit!"}
{"text":"Just got to know about this place, I wish I knew it before! I'm a tea addicted and love combinations.... and this place makes all their drinks with some kind of tea! Oh yes, alcohol + tea matched so nicely!  But waaaait... there is more! They also have something special for their food.... STEAK!!!! Really tender (just found it a bit too dry and cold) and the best about that is the price, surprisingly cheaper than many other steak places!  I know their focus is on drinks, but I took one start off for because food is always really important for me and in my opinion their should look better to their food menu, it didn't seem appeal to me."}
{"text":"Must try place! Their teas have the most robust flavours and the customer service is exquisite. Love the new door and emblem :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and was greeted by the owner today. Gave us a run down of the different types of teas and his recommendations. Ordered the hidden valley coconut milk tea and earl grey milk tea. Coconut milk tea smells like a coconut macaroon and well I just like earl grey! Both yummy! It was nice to see the drink being made with loose leaf tea in those cool tea brewing machines. Gotta try peach blossom next time - smells amazing!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my evening at Infuse Cafe. Don't know how I walked by this place so many times and didn't realize it was there. For some reason I feel like it's really hidden with all the flashy Yonge St. signage everywhere else!  Was here for a Yelp event last night and it was a very cool experience. First we got to hear one of the owner's story on how Infuse came about and we tried the Signature Coffee. This was my favourite drink of the night. It's their take on Vietnamese Coffee and it was good. I also got a chance to try their Jasmine Milk Tea which is made with evaporated milk. The jasmine tea was very flavourful and you can really taste the tea flavour in their drinks using the Bkon machines.   Service was excellent which made the cafe so memorable. Such a great group of baristas! Super friendly and engaging with the customers.   A plus was getting to try the cheesecakes. The regular and matcha cheesecakes were so good! Fluffy and moist and I loved the balance between the cake and cheese texture (I find Uncle Tetsu too creamy tasting). I'm going to buy my cheesecakes from here! Since it's made by a local business owner and I don't have to wait in line :)  Thanks to the owners for having us Yelpers there. You'll see more of me at Infuse!"}
{"text":"This place is like a breath of fresh air compared to normal cafes. Now, I do love me some traditional bubble tea, but sometimes I crave something a bit stronger and natural tasting. Infuse Cafe has exactly that. I ordered the iced jasmine milk tea since I'm a big fan of jasmine tea anything. They brew it with fresh tea leaves right in front of you! While waiting, I had the pleasure to smell the wife variety of unique tea samples that were available for purchase, although I did not end up purchasing any. The jasmine milk had a quite a surprising taste: fragrant, complex and strong. The young man who took my order said that they use condensed milk to craft their drinks and half the sugar that would normally be found in other milk teas. I absolutely loved it, but if you're used to bubble tea you might not since it's only half as sweet and has a much stronger tea flavour. However, for tea enthusiasts I strongly recommend it if you're strolling around downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love wit tea and love to try new places. Infuse cafe offers a wide variety of teas, coffees and cake. The atmosphere is very modern and well decorated. The staff here is extremely welcoming, informative and extremely helpful. They are also a part of the vicinity point system... so make sure  u sign up and start collecting points. I got an iced hibiscus tea that was sweet, refreshing and absolutely flavourful."}
{"text":"First time coming here today. I was really looking for a midday pick-me-up along Yonge St. I just walked past and saw a place that looked new and interesting.  I had a berry iced tea because the regular lemon iced tea was sold out. The beverage was good but not anything out of the ordinary that I wouldn't be able to get from David's Tea or Teavana. Prices are comparable to those places or Starbucks.  The decor is much nicer than David's Tea. It's more welcoming and of a higher quality furniture, and actually feels more like a cafe. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I read some reviews here saying that the coffee is amazing. I regret not getting the coffee as I love to try new places. I will definitely come back to check up and re-review this place."}
{"text":"I love how they make every drink with fresh tea leaves. The staff was super friendly too. He gave us recommendations and even let us smell the tea leaves before purchasing. The reason why I only gave it a 2 star (one for the atmosphere and one for the friendly staff) was because of the drinks that we had. 3 out of 4 of us got a milk tea flavored drink. Now, I'm no milk tea specialist or anything but the way they made their milk teas were not tasty at all. And of course this is my opinion but I'm sure others will have different thoughts. I had the hidden valley coconut milk tea (one of the top sellers). There was a hint of coconut flavor, which I like, but the strong milk taste just made me want to gag. I could not take any more than 5 sips. And I know it was a waste but I had to throw it away..same with 2 other people.  The one good drink out of the 4 was the scarlet rose iced tea. It was refreshing and flavorful. Should've known to go with the plain infused tea drink instead of a milky content."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit always opting for jasmine teas. Their version is perfectly brewed. Clean fragrant flavour. No bitterness from an over steeped tea bag... *ahem* Really enjoyed it.  The staff are always friendly and knowledgable, on my third trip in I did try a ginger and apple? tea as recommended which was really nice and refreshing however the jasmine tea is my absolute favourite.  Great tea, lots of seating, board games, and Japanese cheesecake... Oh and the tea is organic. Pretty cool"}
{"text":"Wonderful and cozy cafe, fantastic staff, innovative tea and coffee, and delicious cakes.  Came here for a Yelp event, got to sample some drinks - Apple Pie (hot), Signature Coffee (cold), and Tropical Crimson (cold).  Apple Pie was like a light and sweet version of apple cider, this one is my favourite since I prefer my tea hot.  The cheesecakes (regular and matcha) by Cecelia were moist, fluffy, creamy, and nicely  balanced.  There was a shelf of scent samples, and I smelled all 27 of them.  Some of them stood out to me, such as Scarlet Rose (sweet smell of rose and raisin) and Hidden Valley Coconut.  The cafe offers a bunch of interesting and cute board games, I look forward to coming back to try those games as well as Matcha Shake and other organic teas."}
{"text":"I'm not one for tea, but I find myself here repeatedly. Their cold teas - sweet - are wonderful and Italian sodas are great, the staff is friendly and know their way around the tea on hand.   The Japanese cheesecake is also great, it's nice and fluffy and it has become a part of my regular rotation.   From someone that doesn't care about tea, this place has made me care and set the standard."}
{"text":"Great customer service. However, there was probably a 10minute wait for a cup of original milk tea? How come? When there arent really much of people.   Although we ordered COLD milk tea, we got a semi-hot/cold drink which was a bummer  + ordered Matcha cheesecake ($5) which tasted okay-ish.. probably a 2.5/5. A pretty small slice for $5.  We shouldve gotten what everyone has been talking about.. Infuse Signature Iced coffee (but wasnt really that much of a fan of coffee) and original cheesecake ($3) but I wanted to try something not sold anywhere so I got the matcha cheesecake.  But here's some tip: if you buy drink w/cake, you get a dollar off for the cake."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and found this place on Yelp. I like how they make the star of the drink, the tea (as it should be!). We tried the classic milk tea and the miracle mango soda. Both drinks were on point. The workers there are really nice and very patient in explaining the different types of teas they have and also what they recommend. Although you can choose the sugar level with their teas, if you do not have dietary concerns, I would go with what they recommend because they really know their stuff. The drinks are not too sweet. Also, the environment is very clean and comfortable. They will also give you their wifi code and they also have some board games available. Will go again and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Got my coffee fix here even though they specialize in tea. I had the 'feeling good' coffee (still cheaper than Starbucks) and it is strong - just how I like it. Few sips and I'm alive again LOL. They're also part of Vicinity so you can collect points, plus if you join, you get a free drink next time! Their coffee and tea is made with some high tech fancy vacuum sealed (???) machine thing... seems legit haha.   They also have a couple of board games including settlers of Catan!! Seems like a great place to get work done and chill with friends.   Staff are super friendly!! :)   Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place has the most unique tasting coffee and tea!! I highly recommend coming here if you need a quiet spot to study and drink some amazing coffee or tea."}
{"text":"High-tech tea brewing, with an interesting drink assortment and lovely staff. It's easy to walk past this unassuming spot amidst the overwhelming signage around Yonge but every time I visit it's nice and quiet inside - good for working or a catch up with a small group of friends. The interiors aren't too special (triangle chairs?) but the staff more than make up for that with their genuine love for tea and their helpful recommendations.   The key draw of this place is their Bkon machines, which brew tea using a vacuum process. Whatever they're doing there's a notable difference and my favourite order, Spicy Ginger Mate ($6), is smooth, flavourful and nicely warming in the colder months. They have Vicinity points too and you can earn a free drink after buying 9."}
{"text":"Infuse cafe is a neat concept and has some great drinks.   The price is high but you're paying for the location, decor, and the unique drinks. I've had the signature coffee because of Joshua L's suggestion and it's good. Nothing to write home about because of the price but it holds it's on. The flavor is sweet (because of condensed milk) with a strong burnt coffee flavor - making it signature.  What makes Infuse acceptable is that they have Vicinity rewards which allows you to collect points and then get a free drink. In a day and age where every food/drink spot has rewards, Infuse does a great job in keeping up with random offers via SMS/email and coupon codes.  I wouldn't come here often because of the price but it's definitely a great place when they've got promotions going on.  WiFi is good enough to get work done but don't expect to stream NBA or Dota 2 at 1080. Some electrical plugs so you can get some work done but they're a little awkwardly placed. Staff are primarily young adults/students - friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Totally caught off guard by this place. I walked by it twice while trying to look for this place. But it is worth coming in for the ambiance and the Japanese cheese cake. I had the Japanese soufflé. It is the best way to end a night cause it is not heavy and it pairs well with almost any cocktail.  I had the Tommy's Tumeric Margarita. An amazing drink with infused tea cuts the alcohol flavor.  I highly recommend this place and will be back to try their reasonably priced steak"}
{"text":"I wanted to come here for awhile, wanting to check out the place. I finally did and am glad I got a chance to try it. I ordered the vanilla bean black tea but right after I ordered it, the person said they didn't have enough so he offered London fog. The drink waa good, the flavor was consistent. The customer service was really good, the people there greet you right when you enter and leave, give you their attention. He explained the science behind the tea brewing machines which was really interesting. I will for sure come back to try their other drinks, particularly their infuse signature."}
{"text":"Their cocktails are great. Very friendly staff and super nice and patient bartender. This is the first tea cocktail bar ever in Toronto. The bartender Faisal patiently explained the ingredients in the cocktail and made lots of research into inventing their own cocktail flavors.  They served medium rare beef but it's super dry. The ravioli was pretty okay, I got the mushroom flavor and it tastes like I was in France. Lol"}
{"text":"I was invited to the Yelp Elite event here and it was a great experience! First things first, the drinks. Had a sample of a couple of their cocktails such as the Sorry Not Sorry, and Pinch me Picasso which were awesome to start with. Really high quality teas which really added another layer of depth to their drinks. Ordered a Mango Mai Tai and a Peach Riot and man, the Mango Mai Tai did not taste like they put 2oz of alcohol in it at all, super refreshing and delicious. The Peach Riot was a good punch in the face as well.  They do serve a couple of dishes here, such as sous vide steaks. As someone who sous vide's at home I know the temperature and thickness of meat plays can play a role to the doneness of the meat which they probably need to play around with a bit more. The medium steak was good and the well done one was... well... well done. I would say that they would still need to work on the final sear/char of the beef as well but for 10-15 bucks, you can't really go wrong in a pinch.  They did have a delicious mushroom ravioli that's surprisingly not on the menu! Glen, if you're reading this, definitely add it!"}
{"text":"Tea from a hi-tech infuser--the people demanded it and science came through. Kidding aside the tea is good, though I'd have to try it again to get a better sense of how much extra teatastic their hi-tech infusers make the product. Let's see if I can say \"hi-tech\" again in this review - I think this early 90s buzzword is due for a revival.   Snacks: gluten free Japanese style cheesecake. It's amazing. Get the matcha. Fluffy, soft, and moist, this balanced cake tastes incredible with half the fat of its western counterpart; in fact, you might call it a hi-tech version of a regular cheesecake. NAILED IT. Anyway I'm coming back ASAP because of this cheesecake, and this is a area of town I rarely venture to for treats like this. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Coooool high-tech tea brewer machine! The staff there was really nice and willing to talk. Try their freshly brewed mocha green tea using the machines."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best tea you will get in Toronto. They use a special infuser machine that insures you get the most from your tea leaves. You can get your beverage in 2 different sizes but its best to go with the larger size as its only about 50 cents more and you get way more.  The selection of teas they have is incredible. If you are undecided just speak with someone who works there! Let them know what types of flavors you usually like and they will help you to pick out a tea. They also have a seasonal menu which I highly suggest looking at before you make your decision as they have certain teas that will only be there for a limited time. There is also a large selection of loose leaf tea you can buy to make at home.  The service here is amazing. Every person I have met who works here is super friendly and helpful. The cafe itself is pretty cool as well.  I highly suggest coming here is you're a tea fan. If you can try the Pretty Peach Milk Tea, I just tried that one yesterday and it was next level amazing."}
{"text":"Their coffee is full of taste and very unique. They are also very supportive of student groups which really says a lot about the company."}
{"text":"Delicious tasting tea, lots of room, relatively quiet, fast wifi and clean washroom. All the ingredients to a great work space. I'd highly recommend coming by here if you want to do some work at a coffee shop. They have all sorts of teas and coffee as well.   I got the vanilla mint tea in cold ice tea without milk and it was delicious! Not too sweet. The service here is really friendly as well which is nice.   The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because the prices of the tea are more towards the costly side ~$5 per drink. Although they do have student discount so make sure you tell them you're a student if you are!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy lounge/bar setting for a \"chill night out\". I tried my first drink: Smokey Rye and Ginger. On the menu they had a disclaimer and described the drink as being highly addictive. They are correct because the next two orders were for the same drink. Got a chance to have some of the Sous Vide Rib Eye: this steak is Damn good for the price! Extra stars go out to how easy it was to spot the place with their one of a kind green fluorescent light sign."}
{"text":"Better than the big guys!!!Pump it in my viens"}
{"text":"Amazing house blend coffee! Great selection of teas too! The staff are so friendly and the place is so cute and clean :)"}
{"text":"Super super super friendly staff, a great atmosphere, and veryyyyy delicious teas and coffee. Second time here, first time I had a coffee \"feeling good\" it was great! This time I had a tea and it was made with their cool infuse machines. Definitely my go-to tea spot around Dundas square and ryerson area. Also get the card and you can get a free tea next time."}
{"text":"I tried the summer lemon, and my friend had the sweet peach, both were very flavourful. Definitely going to have to come back and try some of their milk teas. Chocolate Chai sounded interesting. Their machines were pretty cool too, not something you see everyday."}
{"text":"Given how many positive reviews there were my friends and I decided to give this place a try. We got there late in the afternoon, and saw the very detailed and extensive menu hanging from the front of the cash. Excited, we pitched in our orders only for the girl working there tell us that they were out of all of the options we wanted. Somewhat irked that our orders were denied (we all ordered different things) we went with something else, and again, were denied. Okay... seems like at this point that there was nothing really available.   She was quick to entice us with the teas that were available, except they weren't really appealing much to our disappointment. In the end I went with the infused tea soda (fruit sensation or should I say plain tasteless fizzy sensation) and a butter toffee cookie (which she claimed was freshly made just a while ago but tasted like they were there for many days). My one friend got the ice cream sandwich coffee which tasted exactly like Timmies' iced Capp. My other friend got the marshmallow s'mores milk tea and it just tasted like watered down tea instead of any hint of marshmallow or s'mores much less the two combined.   They had some board games which was nice but the selection is very little compared to riddle room just a few steps away.   All in all, I wouldn't want to come back. Really disappointing experience for all of us."}
{"text":"Everytime I go in, I always get such friendly service. On top of that the tea soda are amaaaaazing.   So far, everything I've tried on the menu is delicious. Even the lip balms sold are awesome! Perfect gift for someone this Christmas!"}
{"text":"Crazy cool spot. Really unique tea brewing setup, amazing blends, and an extremely clean space. The staff was patient with our questions (girlfriend has some unusual allergies) and really friendly. Definitely worth the stop if you find yourself nearby, as it is as step above Teavana and other,more mainstream tea cafes."}
