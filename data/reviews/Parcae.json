{"text":"Cocktails were great.

Food was edgy for the sake of being edgy. Covered in oil.

Wine list was minimal, mediocre and insultingly overpriced."}
{"text":"Great place with a cool atmosphere - somewhat hidden away in the basement of the hotel; but a cool wall of lighting creates the illusion of being above ground. If you're looking for a private place for dinner, this is it.

Pretty eclectic menu, but everything was well executed. Most plates are good for sharing, but if you have more than three people in your party, you'll probably need a second order. Take a chance on the cervelo, it is worth the adventure."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentine's Day for the 8 course tasting menu. Was spectacular!!! Highly recommend the bison tartar, duck ravioli, veal, artichoke and radish salad. Desert was amazing as usual."}
{"text":"I went to Parcae for a celebration dinner with some friends. The restaurant/bar is almost completely hidden inside the Templar Hotel. On the main level is the cocktail reception / waiting area, and the main dining area is downstairs. The decor and setting exudes a feeling of mystery and secrecy.

We essentially tried everything on the menu (with a few exceptions due to unavailability). I personally enjoyed the horse carpaccio, octopus & bone marrow, and branzino the most. The horse carpaccio was fresh and balanced in taste and texture. The branzino was simple but cooked to perfection and went well with the pink lemons. The octopus and bone marrow were prepared deliciously, and paired excellently with the sweet potato purée. My friends also loved the lamb brains (though I am not a big fan of offals). 

Our tomahawk chop was slightly overcooked and a bit dry in some places. We mentioned this in passing to the manager when he walked by our table to introduce himself and ask about how we were finding the food. He generously gave us complementary desserts up at the cocktail lounge after dinner. 

Overall, the food was excellent, but what blew me away was the impeccable service. Our waitress was very patient and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager was very accommodating and generous. You can see that the establishment is committed to giving their patrons an enjoyable gastronomical experience and I applaud them for it."}
{"text":"Great experience, bartender Kevin and our server Andreas really know their stuff.

We had the tasting menu and all the dishes were delicious, some of them were unexpected but surprisingly amazing. My favourites were duck ravioli and octopus and bone marrow. Over all it was a great experience and great ambiance. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I actually made a yelp account just to review this restaurant. That is how disappointed I am with it. As a business owner myself, i hope that this is a sign to do some improvements.

We had a table of 10.

For tapas style food, the food really needs to keep flowing, at no point should you really be sitting 15 minutes between plates. It is understandable for larger tables, however one of my friends had the clam dish and her dish only came after everyone was finished their food. Were they defrosting the clams?? Because they were all rubbery.

-Branzino was good
-Romanesco was good
-Carbonara, the pasta was definitely from a box and was undercooked, not al dente 
-Octopus and bone marrow was solid
-Wine list was like they chose any random bottle off the lcbo rack
-Waiting staff was quite nice and pleasant

I don't mind paying alot for dinner. I've had $400+ personal dinner bills before, but when you are paying a premium for dinner. You are not just paying for food, the premium needs to encapsulate the entire experience. Use those high margins to improve your restaurant, because if you don't you wont get repeat customers. No one at are table was impressed & none of us will be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're a foodie this place if for you. 

Food- easy 5 stars... Food was awesome! 
We tried many items on the menu and even my least favorite meal was great. The ingredients were simple yet the taste portfolio had a unique complexity to it. The acid portfolio was awesome in many of the meals and the use of quality ingredients is without a doubt. 

Portion sizes are bit smaller but I wasn't complaining,  I wanted to run through the entire menu. Def try this place, your taste buds will thank you!

Service- 5 stars,  staff was awesome and energetic.  Super polite and helpful.  At the end of the night we  had 4 ppl in addition to our server checking in and asking how things were going. They easily hit the highest in my tipping % scale.

Ambiance- 4 stars, very cozy and dim light experience. The washrooms were clean and nice (yes I talk about this because if a washroom isn't clean I won't eat). Music was good, I sang along a few songs lol. Not a huge space but it was a nice environment. It was however a bit hard to spot out,  it's a side door on the left side of the reception desk in the templar hotel

Value- 4 stars,  amazing food, amazing service and a nice environment  commands a higher price. The prices are a bit higher (as we ordered many items,  smaller portions).  However due to the overall experience,  they definitely hit my value check mark (cost + experience =:) and I will be seeing them on a regular basis (date nights especially!) 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Romanesco was delicious as well as the horse carpaccio and duck ravioli !! I forget the name of the desserts we had but they were both amazing would definitely recommend this place, will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Québécois nose-to-tail cooking meets contemporary Toronto lounge styles in the Templar Hotel. 

Start upstairs for some solid cocktails against a backdrop of glass vessels filled with a mystery liquid and photographed body parts.

Continue the prohibition-era spirit and move to a subterranean dining room that is bursting with raucous good times. It was hella loud and lots of fun. 

There are naughty dishes like the deep fried lamb brains, horse carpaccio and the drop-dead delicious bread pudding dessert."}
{"text":"A solid 3/5. 

The Good:
-The bartender made me 3 different mystery drinks that were all amazing 
-Whole Branzino: so refreshing and well prepared
-Romanesco: a huge chunk of alien space broccoli that was really good, it was seriously half the size of my head
-Duck Ravioli: the best part of the meal for sure. Delicious.
-Dessert: italian jelly donuts were a hit and a sticky toffee style pudding slathered in maple syrup was to die for

The Eh:
-The Artichokes: good, but a bit boring and very minimal for $8
-the Buttermilk Fried Quails: I forgot I even ate these and really felt nothing towards the dish

The Letdown:
The Horse Carpaccio was not good and the only thing we left behind. I'm not into eating horse to begin with but I found the consistency of the dish very moist and blobish. 

Overall the service was great, the food good and the cocktails better. It is not a place I would return to again until the menu changes."}
{"text":"Very nice space, chic.  Good service and innovative tasty food.  The thyme fri d bread, oh yes, very good"}
{"text":"The chef really has a great imagination and wants to create something wonderful I think, but honestly the execution wasn't there. We ordered pretty much everything interesting on the menu and I didn't LOVE a single thing. There was a dish that really killed my appetite though... The chicken and waffles... No one at the table thought it was appetizing and we couldn't eat it as it was just gross.... Literally a whole dead fried chicken and initially the head was still on it too but we asked them to take it back and remove it. It was really off-putting. The service, although polite was extremely slow and they kept forgetting things. We even had to tell them they forgot to charge someone... I'm pretty sure that's their job."}
{"text":"This place is upscale, tapas style. While they have an interesting menu, the actual food is just soso, especially for the value.  Be ready to leave not feeling full. We ordered the artichoke (a bit bitter because it was burnt), branzino (I had better), sturgeon bone marrow risotto (looked more interesting than it tasted). I did like the horse Carpaccio and the fried Lamb brains. We ordered waffle with hazelnut icecream and foie gras for dessert because we were intrigued by the foie gras, however we were disappointed at how little foie gras (shaved on top of the icecream) there were. The service was just OK, not what I expected for an upscale restaurant. Their menu is also very limited so I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night. The weird thing about this place is if you passed by the lobby, you would have no idea that it was actually a restaurant. It looks like an office or hotel lobby, but fear not there much more interesting decor downstairs.  

It was a bit empty at 5PM, but quickly started to fill up as the night went on.  We ordered their deep fried bread, horse carpaccio, tuna, squid ink risotto, Zucchini,  duck and the pizza. I thought the pizza, bread, zucchini, and duck were really good. The rooster was alright.  While the squid ink and horse carpaccio were interesting sounding, I couldn't really say it was very tasty. The portions are small so you will have to order multiple dishes. Overall, I thought it was a pretty solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Cocktails were great,great service. Door to entrance was a bit hidden but I like the secretive effect. Food was not as great as the drinks,but still good. Will definitely come again to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food here. Although the place is cute with great ambiance, we took previous suggestions and ordered the duck raviolo, octopus salad, pappardelle and roasted eggplant to share between two people. I would say most of the food came out cold or lacked flavour. Portion sizes were also small so we were still hungry at the end of the meal. Overall, the value isn't support by the price right now."}
{"text":"Expected better food from the higher prices and upscale atmosphere, but was disappointed by the tiny portions and mediocre taste. Parcae offered very unique and creative dishes and plating such as Squid Ink Risotto, but I would not return to leave without a full stomach (but empty wallet). Fantastic service and ambiance as expected, despite being in a hard-to-find basement of a discrete hotel on Adelaide."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy. Lots of bugs flying around. Flies, moths and little fruit flies. My skin was crawling. Never experienced anything like this. 

I had veal main which was sous vide and bland. Sweet breads that accompanied were salty and oily. The mushrooms were vinegar. Really awful dish. A chore to eat. 

Asparagus appetizer was ok but bacon was overpowering. 

Eggplant appetizer was ok hence two stars. 

As I walk out i am scratching my legs from bug bites.

Sad it cost over 160 for two people."}
{"text":"Winterlicious means trying new restaurants, and so it was that I found myself in Parcae on a cold January evening.

It's a small place, but the ambiance is inviting and the service was phenomenal. We started with their Complimentary Fried House Bread (\"Crotonese and thyme infused fried bread served with garlic oil\"). This was definitely an above average start to the meal, as these small fried balls of bread were perfectly cooked and the accompanying garlic oil was addictive.

For my appetizer, I went with the Cervelo (\"Deep fried lamb brains, chicoria, seasonal mushrooms\") for the sole reason that I've never eaten lamb brains and I'm always excited to try something new. I have to admit, though, that while the dish was exquisitely prepared, I can't say I'm in any hurry to eat lamb brains again. The texture is quite mushy, almost off-puttingly so, and there's this metallic taste that isn't exactly delightful.

My main was the Pappardelle (\"Dorset lamb, tomato, scamorza, marjoram\"), which I really, really enjoyed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the meat sauce was subtle yet impressively flavorful.

Dessert was the Pudding Chomeur (\"Baked sponge cake, maple syrup, banana & peanut butter ice cream\") and oh my good god was it incredible. I'd had this dessert many years ago at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal and it blew my mind then, and I have to admit this version blew my mind as well. The maple-syrup and banana infused sponge cake is scrape-the-side-of-the-jar delicious, while the peanut butter ice cream is nothing short of divine. This was seriously one of the best desserts I've eaten in a while."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Chef Danny Hassel is incredible, the staff are so friendly and helpful, and the food is unbelievable. These guys have got it right! Best place and such a great energy."}
{"text":"Flavours on the plate
Made a special night better
Words don't do justice

(That's my review in Haiku)
And some real notes:
- the service  made me feel special

 - I had the tomato salad (sans croutons for me).   We had to get another one because first I forgot to mention my allergy, and 
Grilled eggplant (minus onions which had flour). 
There were actually too many gluten free options to choose from, so I need to go back.   
Thanks Parcae - wasn't expecting to enjoy everything so much."}
