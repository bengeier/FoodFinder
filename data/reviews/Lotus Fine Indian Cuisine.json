{"text":"Yes! I have been looking for a good, local, Indian restaurant since I moved here 11 years ago - this is, most definitely it. Tasty veggie samosas, with good texture and encased in a crispy pastry with no hint of greasiness.  Good onion bhaji and pappadums. 
Delicately spiced saag paneer, creamy chicken tikka masala, and a more robust, but very tender lamb bhuna enhanced with a lovely saffron rice; all extremely well executed and nicely presented. And the naan bread is absolutely the best. The portions are generous and there was plenty to take home and enjoy another day. 
Pleasant service and a quiet atmosphere (Sunday evening, other times may be busier). I will definitely return often."}
{"text":"Ordered from Lotus on New Year's Eve and was very happy with the food. Beef korma was outstanding while butter chicken, Chana masala and aloo gobi were at least as good as Green Chile, my old go-to takeout place. Will definitely be coming back to Lotus soon."}
{"text":"Just opened 3 or 4 days ago! I get to be the first to review! First of all, it's been agony,awaiting the opening, but a place worth waiting for is . . . Well, worth waiting. 

The renovations to the former Blue House are extensive. The inside is completely refreshed, and so is the kitchen, with extensive renovations that prolonged the project, the manager apologetically explained.

No apology needed!

The beef samosas were delicious, and were a generous size. I was also treated to some other appetizery bits--some kind of chicken as well as a house made lamb sausage. Wow! Really nice, both. 

For the main event, chicken korma on coconut rice with garlic naan bread. Well to put it simply, I'll tell you this is Namskar quality level (though the rice was better than I remember at Namskar). As if that wasn't compelling enough, it's close by right in my neighborhood--19th street and Northmount drive (northwest). I can see I'm gonna be hooked.

Value for money was excellent. Service was efficient, friendly and eager to please. 

Gosh, I just don't know when I'll ever get to my former favorite, the Namskar, now! This place deserves to enjoy every success. If you're in the neighborhood, how can you resist?! And if you're farther away, it's worth the drive to Charleswood."}
{"text":"As far as Indian food goes, this is fairly solid. I got the lamb korma, garlic naan, beef samosa, and aloo gobi. The flavor of the lamb korma was good, but I wish that the sauce was thicker. I couldn't taste much of the garlic ok the garlic naan, but it still wasn't bad. The beef samosa was alright, nothing great and I probably wouldn't order it again. The aloo gobi was ok, but not quite the flavor I'm looking for an an aloo gobi. Still, it was better than the previous Indian restaurant I ate at here in Calgary.

Bottom line, the food here is nothing special, but should at least satisfy your Indian food cravings."}
{"text":"Tried the lamb korma, chicken vindaloo and a paneer curry. All were yummy! Chicken vindaloo was a standout for me. Definitely glad that this opened up. Can't wait to try other items."}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian food and I decided to stop by this place for lunch. I took a look at the lunch buffet but since I'm vegetarian with a dairy allergy - there was only one item on the buffet for me so I opted to get some takeout. I ordered the vegetable samosas, eggplant dish, vegetable curry dish, vegetable noodles, roti and garlic naan ( I wanted leftovers for dinner).   They have an grand opening discount of 15% right now until December 31st. The food was very reasonable - my total bill was under $35.  When the food was ready, I was also offered a container for some free dessert or food from the buffet - I decided to try some of the zucchini curry.  The food was very good - my favourites was the eggplant dish and the vegetable noodles. I will definitely get takeout from them again."}
{"text":"Terrific local Restaurant. Last night we decided to give the Lotus a try. We have not been back to this location since the Blue House closed. 
First off, the aroma that you experience when you enter the door is very pleasant. The owners have redone the decor and layout very well, and it is now very comfortable. 

The staff are very friendly and efficient, and the music and atmosphere make the place inviting. The naan bread is outstanding. We ordered the butter chicken, a nine vegetable curry dish and the saffron rice. All of them were served hot and very tasty. 
I really think that this is one of the best new restaurants that has opened in this part of the NW for some time.
Dining in was a real good experience, and we also noted that they were doing a very active takeout business as well. This was some of the freshest and best prepared Indian food we have had for some time."}
{"text":"No fuss - just good, honest, decent 'western' Indian food. Vindaloo was well flavoured and nice and hot, as it should be, but so often isn't in western Canada. Perhaps a bit pricey but that's Calgary for you. For four of us, if we'd all had a drink or two, a side dish or two and pappadums, the meal would have come in at about $200, which is a lot for a curry not served in a swanky downtown restaurant. As it was we 'economised' slightly and kept it to $110."}
