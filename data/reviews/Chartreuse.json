{"text":"9 of us booked their private functions room for a family celebration.  We had beer, wine, appetizers and entrees.  The total bill was $315.  The food was excellently prepared and the wait service was attentive, prompt, courteous and friendly.  Chartreuse has a quiet, rustic atmosphere that is perfect for intimate dinners.  Would I recommend this restaurant?  ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"Came for Saviour York Region event - $35 for preset menu. Food was not fresh! It is quite outdated restaurant that targets older crowd, but having warmed up food was even bigger set back. There are much better places in Kleinburg to dine."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it!!!!! Me and my friend visited Friday night, and there were a few other people in the dining room. The atmosphere was so classic and beautiful, it was quiet, perfect classical music, the table was set with two pink roses and our waiter brought us a simple white candle, we ordered red wine that was delish, the entire setting was just romantic and magical. I actually had a tear in my eye I was so moved with the atmosphere. The waiter was kind friendly and attentive, he felt like family. The restaurant had an old charm to it that i loved, the energy and vibe was amazing, the ghosts were definitely friendly! Food: classic menu options done very well. I ordered the salad and the duck, soooo tasty it was served with this berry sauce that had large hints of cinnamon which i loved. Cooked perfectly, my friend ordered the elk which was flavourful and a bit tough to chew (as the waiter mentioned would be). Overall this is my new favourite romantic little restaurant, I will be having many more nights here. I felt so elegant sitting in there, it's definitely an old school historic feeling.   Please go, enjoy the vibe and say hello to my friendly ghost friends!"}
{"text":"The menu here is a classic French menu.  And when I say classic, I mean old, with no modernization to speak of.  If that's what your looking for, come here, because the quality is great.  I had the French onion soup, would have like a little more salt and a little more crunch to the bread, but otherwise good.  Ordered the filet mignon, classic bacon wrapped.  It was perfectly cooked and bursting with taste.  Mashed potatoes were very bland though.  This is a quaint establishment with quality food, but I'll leave it to the seniors."}
{"text":"If there's a minus 100 stars I would've picked it! We went there for a family dinner. They had a party to set up for 4... We were there at 2 and were out by 3:30! From the minute we got there the server (Serge) was very rude... Keeps rushing us and telling us it's time to leave... Meanwhile there other people in the dinning room that were not rushed... Needless to say we paid our bill (with tips) and were leaving when the server starting mumbling and swearing in front of children!!!! We told him it was uncalled for then him and another server (Milano) started telling us we were trying to pick a fight..and that we were late coming in!!! When we told him there were others in the dining room he said they were regulars and they know him!!!  Then the owner came and his excuse for this rude behavior of his employees was that they were under stress!! If you get stressed to have 8 adults and 2 kids for lunch then maybe you shouldn't have a restaurant business. Or at least let us know before serving us then we would've taken our business somewhere else!!!!!  And he was upset that he has to vacuum!!!!  The food wasn't even that great to make up for the awful service... the tip was undeserved!!!!"}
{"text":"Just adorable.  This converted country house serves up simple and elegant regional fare in a relaxed and quaint environment.  We were there for an after-wedding brunch and everything was done to perfection.  Service--friendly but not intrusive.  I didn't even notice our coffees, waters and OJs being refilled, yet managed never to have an empty cup.  We told the waiter we needed to leave by one to catch a flight and he took care of us quicksmart, while never neglecting the rest of the party.  Food--fantastic.  The omelette with spinach and salmon was perfection.  It was served with a mixed greens salad and bread on the side.  Everything was light and tasty and *satisfying.*  My step-dad, an Albanian with very particular views on How Things Should Be Done, was surprised to find he loved everything, despite there being no toast and the unheard of salad being served.  :)  Atmosphere--quaint but not twee.  Charming but not cloying.  Elegant but not stuffy.  I liked that despite being a somewhat small space, it was very easy to move around.  Overall, it was very relaxing being in there while still managing to have an air of history and stature.  Value--absolute.  We were there for a pre-paid event, but I checked out the menu and prices online and I would happily have paid $20 - $25 for my meal.  There are actually a range of options and prices so this can be a full-on extravagant night out or a quiet wee treat.    If you're anywhere near Kleinburg, go here!"}
