{"text":"I think that it's safe to say that every good neighborhood has a quick and reasonably priced Chinese take- out restaurant. I use the term \"restaurant\" lightly. Your options for dine- in or take-out are limited to take- out considering there are no tables inside. This was refreshingly not a surprise to me. Sometimes simplicity is the most effective approach. One thing thats gets me is how most Chinese restaurants have that cheesy picture menu that looks like it's from the 80's, this place included. Either way, I had the chicken n broccoli. The portion was spot on for the price and they didn't skimp on the broccoli, nor the chicken. I will definitely be going back to satisfy that Chinese craving. Oh, and I also noticed that they close at 11pm on the weekdays which is cool."}
{"text":"Best take-out Chinese I can find in the plaza midwood area. I've tried several others and was not happy. Hong Kong is consistent and has the best tasting food imho."}
{"text":"I love the food. I have been eating at hong kong for years. The buffet is a steal, very cheap and they will make whatever you ask them to."}
{"text":"I usually hate little Chinese places like this, but Hong Kong surprised me.  I ordered the chicken lo mein, extra spicy, and it was by far the spiciest I've had anywhere!  Really good- my only other favorite lo mein place is Mama Fu's, but this is less than half the price.  Great if you're in the area and looking for something quick to pick up.  It's a ton of food too.  My husband loves the wonton soup and the dumplings, he gets those every time as well."}
{"text":"My experience with the Hong Kong Chinese in Kannapolis has been of good food and adequate portions, but not a glamorous experience in going to pick it up. 

As some of the other reviews note, it is not a nice new, sparkling place inside. It is cluttered and not anything impressive at all. 

My favorite items here are the scallion chicken, fried dumplings, and egg rolls."}
{"text":"This business has really changed in the last few months since new ownership. Prices went up. Portions went down. \"Service\" from the surly girl at the counter nonexistent. It's too bad, we've been coming here for many, many years. It was always a great option for a good, inexpensive meal in Plaza Midwood.  Off to Cherry House for good."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy; large portions, inexpensive, and good stuff!"}
{"text":"The food is always very good. Good portion size. The family who operates this place is very friendly and hard working. I recommend this place for take out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here two times in a five year period. Both times were because it snowed and everywhere else was closed. If it snowed again and I needed something to eat, I will look at this review to remind myself not to eat here again.

Rice- gross. Their \"fried rice\" consists of plain yellow rice. 
Lo mein- has zucchini and mushrooms in it... odd
Hot and sour soup- worst I've ever had. Seriously. Weird smell and bean sprouts in it. 
Sesame chicken- better when you add soy sauce 
Crab Rangoon- good
Fried dumplings- small but decent 
Egg roll- gross and mushy."}
{"text":"So disappointed..... Ever since the new management took over. The employees attitude is so negative. Food isn't as good as it used to be either."}
{"text":"Being from New York I take Chinese food very serious and had been on a hunt to find somewhere that has good lo mein and I will have to say this place has some really solid dishes the shrimp with vegetables is really good, spring rolls are good, beef and broccoli, and of course the lo mein"}
{"text":"portion size was ok but when I order a \"szechuan\" dish I expect it to be spicy, this was just sweet."}
{"text":"It is average, nothing amazing, nothing disgusting. It's cheap and close to home. Spring Roll was good but I got Sweet and Sour Chicken and it was 'meh'. Felt like Flash fried chicken, not sure if fresh or just thawed and warmed up."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for almost 10 years and when I get back in town, I go there.  Excellent food, inexpensive prices and quick service.  Great place and Top 5 in my book in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everyone should have a go-to Chinese takeout restaurant. That place that is stored in your phone and whose menu you don't need to be able to order. Hong Kong is mine.

Do not expect atmosphere (or even tables of any kind). Do not expect frills. Do not expect fortune cookies with your takeout (which does seem a bit stingy to me, but you know what I can overlook it). Just expect tasty food and friendly staff (even if the girl who took my order last time did look like she wasn't out of elementary school).

I am a huge fan of the Beef w/Garlic Sauce combination dinner. It comes with an egg roll, which is never overly greasy and always has a nice balance of cabbage and non-cabbage fillings. The fried rice is good, though not exceptional, and the beef is joined by an assortment of peppers, baby corn, carrot, celery, mushrooms and probably some other veggies I can't remember. It is listed on the menu as hot and spicy but don't believe it.

Did I mention that I get three dinners out of one order? Now that's value, my friend. Tasty, tasty value."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this a bad review is because of the woman who took my order and remained on her phone the entire time she was talking to me, taking my credit card, running it and handing it back to me. I've been in the service industry my entire life, and nothing annoys me more than someone who couldn't care less about their guest/customer. You give full attention to the person with whom you're doing business. Staying on your phone sends the clear message that you can't really be bothered with anything else. It's incredibly rude and insensitive. AND, she missed out on a good tip, which I always leave. 

However, the service up to this point has always been great. Everyone else I've had dealings with has been respectful and courteous. The food is also good, and I'll be back...just not when the lady in bright pink is there. Thanks to the rest of the staff for knowing what good service is about."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here and honestly, it was the best Chinese food we have been able to find since moving to the area. We had sesame chicken and General tso's combination plates. Both were tons of food and the chicken wasn't over cooked, which was nice."}
{"text":"Hong Kong earns stars for fair prices, fast service, and proximity to where I live.

It loses stars for inconsistency.

The Hot & Sour soup is good one visit, less good the next.

The Singapore Noodles are consistent in their well-preparedness, taste and volume.

Their version of Chicken Fried Rice is eye-opening. Yellow - blindingly yellow - rice, with no traditional egg, carrots, peas nor green onions. Only white onions and some bean sprouts to accompany the chicken. 

I wish it was open later, and I want to know the story behind their sign."}
{"text":"This place is just up the street from where I live so I figured it was time to give it a shot. I am constantly searching for better Chinese food in the area. This place wasn't anything amazing but was also honestly better than a lot of others I have had in the area. Exactly what you think of when you think of just grabbing some Chinese take out. The tofu was actually pretty good and the spring rolls were nice and flaky. I would order here again."}
{"text":"The Iced Tea was so good! I love it, but that's not all I went for. I first called before I ordered and she was so inpatient on the phone. When I showed up to order instead it seemed like a nice place minus it was not very well lit. My order of Orange Chicken wasn't too good. Its my first time but I'm sure the chicken shouldn't have been that crispy that it was almost burnt. I didn't finish it. The rice was also over cooked. First time here and most definitely my last!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Can't say much after that - the food was terrible, the chicken had a jelly texture - the MSG within must have been sky high. I ordered the yellow chicken curry and within a few bites I felt ill. Very disappointing, not to mention the $8+ price tag."}
{"text":"The food here has gotten significantly better within the last few months. My BF and I love the egg rolls and we usually share a dinner combination. For the price and convenience of the location it's one of our favorites."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food in Charlotte. I have lived in Charlotte for almost 3 years and nothing beats it. 
Most ethnic food in this city is lacking but they definitely are not. The food is always consistent and they recently got a new website hat lets you order online."}
{"text":"Well, the food was just ok for my taste buds.   It was nothing like any of my favorite Chinese places around the United States.  I ordered the standard General Tso  Chicken and my counterpart ordered the  Sweet and Sour chicken with fried rice.   The Fried rice was a little a little bland but not the worst that I've tasted.  The General Tso was not as spicy but it did have flavor which helped the fried rice.  The compliantly  Egg roll was good just it was just to greasy.  They do not have delivery which was a real bummer.  Luckily I was staying just down the street and the took orders over the phone.  As for the Sweet and Sour Chicken the breaded chicken was great.  Nice and crispy on the outside. 

Would I order again.  Yes, I would consider ordering from here again, their prices aren't too bad for the amount of food you get.  They are located and have been in business for a while up by brookgate."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, because I was personally this restaurants biggest advocate. Telling as many people as I could about this great little hole in the wall.

Long story short, drove by one afternoon, 3-4 CMPD outside. They were then closed for a few days. Went in the day I noticed they were re-opened.
No familiar faces, the cute girl at the counter who always knew what I wanted was gone, and so was the quality of food.

Gave them the benefit of the doubt to get on their feet, but it never happened.Returned 4 separate times always hoping it would go back to being great. Sub-par ingredients, all the sauces now taste almost exactly the same. It is a real shame.

Now I have to find a new go-to take out place!! So Sorry!"}
{"text":"Definitely our \"go to\" Chinese close to home! Prices are great, service is courteous (even with special requests) and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"I ate it and I didn't die. I'm so happy to say these words. What more can you say about greasy rice and cogulated 'brown' sauce?"}
{"text":"One star is too high of a rating. First of all, the only reason I ate here is because I didn't feel well and was craving takeout Chinese food. Hands down the most disgusting Chinese food I've ever eaten. I ate one bite of everything and then threw it in the trash. The \"chicken\" was translucent and tasted like rat meat. Spend an extra two dollars and go to Ho Ho Cherry House in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"Had a bait and switch situation when ordering pick up. Suggest you order off the menu at the store and check what is put in the bag before you leave. I ordered fried rice as a side and got steamed. The price I paid was 30 percent more than the prices advertised in yelp.  The food was of lower quality and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"By far, the most disgusting restaurant I have ever been to in my life! If I could stop one person from going there by writing this review then I am happy. The restaurant is extremely dirty. I can't believe they haven't been shut down. The lady at the counter was so rude to me. The only reason I ate here was because it was snowing so hard and I couldn't get anywhere else. The paint on the walls is coming off. The ceiling is leaking. The tables and chairs are disgusting. They gave me my sweet tea in a soup bowl. I felt immediately nauseas upon looking at the food. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Craving Chinese food that day but Hong Kong turned out to be a BAD idea.

My husband brought home my shrimp fried rice, usually a tried and true meal.

The shrimp was good. The rice looked like it had been cooked in mud, the day before. The onions tasted fresh.

No need to waste our money on this place again."}
{"text":"I should have consulted yelp prior to my visit here Friday. I still haven't found a really great Chinese-American take-out place in Charlotte yet. (So if you know of one please do share).

I went with my sesame chicken extra-crispy with rice. You can not switch noodles for rice without incurring an up-charge. Ordering on the phone was a task...I always feel bad when I find myself asking someone to repeat themselves more than once. 

Overall the pieces of chicken were crisp (reason for two stars) but super small. The sauce flavor was a little off to me too. The rice which was much more plentiful than the chicken,  tasted ok but  was too overloaded with onion. I did like the flavor of the egg roll but it was overly greasy...almost wet. It just seemed like everything was not quite good. 

This is a take-out venue only ...and I feel so badly for the people working there as there was obviously no AC, it was HOT. 


Even my hungry bf who snagged my leftovers commented on the bad Chinese food. This won't be our go-to."}
{"text":"Just your run-of-the-mill Chinese joint. At least the egg roll was crunchy. But didn't really have much flavor. Sesame chicken didn't have hardly any sauce on it. Fried rice was skimpy on vegetables, and again not much flavor. Nothing made me gag, but nothing was great. You can probably do better. I mean you're on Central ave after all. Drive five minutes further down Central and go to Dim Sum."}
{"text":"A-OK pretty much sums this place up. 

It's not fancy, it's at the end of a strip mall. I get take out about once a month and I stick to soup (I flip flop between egg drop and hot n sour) and steamed dumplings. For me, it fills my need. I never come here for anything else. Someone noted in another review that the hot n sour is inconsistent. I've always gotten good batches in my experiences. 

You'll want to do take out. There are only a couple tables here. It's usually just people waiting on their orders, not actually eating there."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, and the price is crazy affordable for the portion. Not a single complaint from the people in my office which never happens. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My second time ordering from Hong Kong and can say my experience has been consistent. 

Never had an issue with the food itself, my issue has been the execution I guess you can call it or rather lack there if to detail. My first visit was very similar to this visit so they get an A for consistency. The food is cooked and prepared well but again details. We requested 2 orders of chicken wings with chicken fried rice no onions (). The young lady who took the order did fine our receipt shows the right order but one order doesn't have chicken fried rice and the other order does. A nice quality check would be great but this isn't a gourmet or 5 star restaurant so whatever. My first visit the Order had onions which we definitely didn't want onions.

Overall, this is a great spot and I'll be back again when the when the urge for Chinese hits lol. My recommendation is just to check your order since we're 0-2 lol but the food is good. Check them out!"}
