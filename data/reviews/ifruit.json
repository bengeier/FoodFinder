{"text":"iFruit is a relatively new addition to the array of options McGill students/La Cite residents have for quick eats. I'm surprised they don't have more people showing up, because they have good, very reasonably priced food. Their za'tar cheese wrap is only about $4 and you can add whatever fillings you want. Their smoothies are a fan favourite and I really enjoy the Palmyra, a mix of strawberry, banana and avocado with a large dollop of cream cheese a bit of cinnamon (I think) for good measure.  The staff are really nice as well and recognize repeat customers, which, as a cash-strapped McGill student, I certainly was. They make recommendations for you and suggest things that would go well together. Overall I'd highly recommend visiting iFruit."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I've been here. It's where I go to get my smoothie fix (I don't have a smoothie maker at home - unfortunately - but even if I did, I'd still make an excuse to come here). Try all the smoothies. I love both the avocado and ifruit (the banana/strawberry). And if you can't choose between the two, they offer the palymra smoothie (a combination of avocado and ifruit with ashta and honey on top). For smoothies, they only have one size. Pricewise, it's average ($6 for a palymra and $3 for the ifruit). But they should give bigger portions because I find myself drinking the entire smoothie in less than 10 minutes and then licking the cup afterwards 'cause it's that good! I dream about their smoothies sometimes (ssh).   Also, they'll remember you if you've made an impression the first time and you come back a couple more times. The staff is always welcoming and they can give you recommendations of what tastes better with what. For instance, instead of a zatar and cheese wrap, how about a zatar and yogurt wrap? Most of the menu items are certainly unique."}
{"text":"The wraps are unique and well priced. The fruit smoothie is excellent as well. Underrated place."}
{"text":"Delicious wraps and extremely friendly staff. Special recommendation for the zaatar and labneh wrap, the shish taouk wrap and the ifruit smoothie"}
{"text":"After seeing flyers under parked car wiper blades the week before, I found ifruit's location on foot days later and made a digital note-to-self. In need of a healthy and affordable lunch alternative, I waded into their pristinely clean space on Parc. Green, orange and beige painted walls and neat walnut coloured tables plus light brown formed plastic chairs make for a simple yet welcoming d√©cor. Three wide screens above the counter display colourful photos of three main menu pillars; salty, sweet and blended juice items. They also have a freezer unit with about 12 flavours of exquisitely crafted Italian made (I was told the maker is 1st generation Italian) gelatos. I sampled vanilla (creamy and rich), cappuccino (spot on), raspberry, strawberry and kiwi all flowing with little blended pieces of the real fruit. One of the better I have had in that style anywhere. Now, I'll go in reverse and tell you what I actually ate. They seem to specialize in Syrian style Saj pita warmed and finished on a specialized dome shaped grill specially imported from Lebanon. Despite wanting to order one of everything, I opted for the #2 Combo, comprising a Saj Zatar pita and a Strawberry Banana blended juice shake. The Saj was served folded over and crispy (filled with traditional Zatar [thyme, sesame and herb] paste with cucumber, tomato and mint toppings). It was just right for a light lunch and the smooth Strawberry Banana drink (blended with Ashta - a soft cheese blend for sweetness). The avocado blend they let me try before ordering was the best I can remember - usually a bit too sharp when liquefied. Free wifi and a clean place to sit, eat, read, talk or work makes this place a must in the neighborhood. Both items totaled less than $7 (tax in). I really can't wait to try more menu items (no - the samples of gelato don't count)."}
