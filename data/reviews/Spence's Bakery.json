{"text":"I have to say that I am a big fan of this place.  I used to go to Raps right next door but discovered the jerk chicken in this place by fluke.   I have tried many jerk chicken places and I can say that the sauce that Spence uses is by far the best.  Nice flavour and not too salty! There is a little hint of sweetness, similar to what you'd taste with rib sauces, which give it a unique flavour.  The chicken is actually juicy and they give you decent portions."}
{"text":"Rap's had no jerk available yet-it was too early in the afternoon.  My husband and I were super disappointed.  We were about to give up our search for delicious jerk chicken but behold-Spence's bakery- \"Is it any good?\".  I quickly googled it and found a lone yelp review. I was unsure but decided to try it. So glad we did! Very tender and flavourful-BAM! Not the prettiest place but great chicken."}
{"text":"Nope! No freshly baked bread or bagel here!  Just goooooooood .... Goodness!!  Oh boy! Great place for take-out but the location is on a busy street plus construction happening whole summer long, still didn't stop me from getting some goodness gracious oxtail so flavorful and tender!!  The legendary Rap's is just next door but this place deserves a highly recommended recognition based on consistent quality of juicy chicken(jerk sauce is tangy and spicy) and served fresh from the grill ready for the kill!   Yes, not the best looking place and has only a few tables for dining in but that's just the facade that's stopping you from experiencing amazing home-style Jamaican cooking with unbeatable price and portions."}
