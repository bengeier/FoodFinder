{"text":"We came to Las Vegas for the Christmas vacation. One UNLV friend recommended this restaurant to me, and it absolutely worth 5 stars rating. If you from Northeast of China, you must be here!!  The food is so good and will make you miss home. You should be here. Will back to here during spring break next year."}
{"text":"Food was good the service on the other hand was terrible.   Upon arriving we did get greeted and seated. However, we had to get the two servers attention to take our order. When we told one of the ladies we are ready to order she gave us attitude. When she brought our drinks over she just slammed it on the table and didn't even give us any straws.   Now to the food. We ordered the beef soup dumpling, beef dumpling, house fried rice, deep fried squid, and duck. All were delicious! You can tell that the dumpling are made fresh.   Overall, I would of gave this place a better review if the service wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Pretty good Northern Chinese style Cuisine.   Atmosphere- Nice little place with very bright flowery decor, hehe. Also soothing music playing in the background.  Service- We came just a bit after they opened, so we were able to be seated right away. Service was friendly; the woman brought our tea within a couple of minutes and came by to take our order shortly after.  Food- The food was pretty good. We ordered 5 dishes: Tossed Mung Clear Noodles, Szechuan Fish Fillet with Sour Cabbage, Beef Soup Dumpling, Beef Patty, and the Sauteed Potatoes with Eggplant. The tossed noodles was the perfect chilled dish for this hot weather. Pretty sure it's a peanut based sauce and it was tasty. The fish dish was HUGE, as it was more like a soup dish. It was really flavorful. Both the dumpling and patty were good as well, but I wish the patty had a little bit more flavor and less oily. The beef soup also didn't have as much juice in it as I thought (also less compared to other soup dumplings I've had). The eggplant was leaning more towards the salty side, so I recommend getting rice if you are going to order that dish.   If you're passing by and in need of some food, stop by and try this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were finding a place to have lunch and drove by this place. I yelped it right away and we decided to give it a try due to the good rating. And we are happy for the decision because we like the food here a lot. The food is very close to what I had in Beijing. We tried beef dumplings (steamed), beef stuffed cake, cold noodle with white sesame sauce. They were all good. We definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Their food taste the same as what I had in my hometown. It gave me a lot of comfort during my short stay in Vegas.  I loved every bit of it. Every dish I ordered didn't disappoint me.   They didn't comprise their cooking for American customers. But you know what, you didn't have to fly to China to have the real authentic Northeast Chinese food! The restaurant in LA cannot beat Dumpling King on this!"}
{"text":"This place shouldn't even be called dumpling king. There \"dumplings\" are more like spring rolls with no filling!!! I go to markham usually for dumplings and they are way superior!!!! Don't waste your money!!! There's not even a spoonful of filling n no juice...just horrible!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice. Great service, clean environment. And the food taste very home made. Means my boyfriend really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in many months now but there I was, all waxing nostalgic for dumplings earlier today, and here I am now, extolling the virtues of this wonderful dumpling bastion up in the great white north (york).   Located in a tiny circular street surrounded by condos off Yonge south of Finch, this is a small (and I mean 4 tables with no proper washroom and only one person in the kitchen small) mom and pop type dumpling joint. The couple who own it come from Dalian, China (known for its fresh seafood) and both the size and their background come through on their menu.  They offer several different types of dumplings in three styles: steamed, boiled, and fried. The interesting thing about the fried is that they are deep fried (!?) as opposed to the potsticker kind you typically see due to the whole one person in the kitchen thing. One of their better, if not arguably one of their best, dumpling offerings are their fish or seafood dumplings. They have others such as pork and napa, beef and onions, or egg and chive.  For $6-7 dollars, you get 16 (!) dumplings done the way you want (although I prefer steamed most of the time). There nothing quite like that first juicy bite of a freshly steamed dumpling followed by the subsequent bursts of umami packed flavour as you dip it into a mixture of chili oil, chinese vinegar, sesame oil, and soy sauce.   More salient points as to how awesome this place is: - Their chili oil and fresh noodles are made in house - The male owner who you usually see in the front is super friendly and doesn't like to accept tips (but I remember leaving one anyway) - Great sides (the cucumber one as well as the raw potato one come to mind) - Gratis tea  Dumpling places are few and far between in Toronto (certainly fewer serving mainland style ones like DK) but what with the recent growing pains of Mother's Dumplings at their new location and Dumpling House's past track record of rats, I'd much rather make the longer trek over to the King, where I can certainly feast like one on an affordable budget.   PS: This spot has no relation whatsoever to Dumpling King in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Was on my way to ramen tatsu, but they weren't open until 1130 and I was too hungry to wait.  I've seen this place many time but never tried it. Decided to change that since they were about to open. Glad I did.  Met the staff since I arrived as they did. Nice group.  Ordered the stone dumplings, soup dumplings and lamb dumplings. I'd have gotten a main dish but wanted to get a to go order since I thought I'd still be getting Ramen Tatsu.  Oh no, this place hit the spot.  Stone Dumplings were the best, Soup Dumplings next. Not too much packed in the soup dumplings, which was a plus for me because I didn't want them to explode on me.  Lamb Dumplings were good but I enjoyed the other two more so.   Not bad on the price. I eat a lot so I had 30 dumplings total. The service was fast and the waiting couch they had was well laid out.   In the end, I picked up too many to even think about adding ramen from Ramen Tatsu into the mix.   I'll return, and I definitely recommend Dumpling King. I'd give them 5 stars, but I would need to try a few other Dumpling joints in town before I'm able to do that."}
{"text":"I will be coming back for the Beef Dumplings! I saw previous reviews and had to try them. My hubby and I were not disappointed! I really like the decor and the service was great. Very nice staff. We also tried the leek pancakes and the beef patties (rou jia mo). It was all delicious. I am looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, we checked this place out in December. The beef soup dumplings were probably the highlight. There weren't enough vegetarian or seafood options here. The tea was lukewarm. The restaurant was cold. I think there are better places to go in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was decent but the food was very mediocre. We got the pork chives steamed, and seafood fried. The skin was a tad too thick and the filling had very little flavor - recommend the dumpling house nearby much more."}
{"text":"From all the choices in this area, I had heard things about this place. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't the best.  From the positive sides, price was good (iirc, $6.99 for a plate of 12-15 dumplings, great deal), the side sauces were good, the place seemed clean, and as most places in this area, they promptly offered courtesy green tea. The presentation of the plate wasn't great (just a plain white plate full of plain looking boiled -white- dumplings) but the flavor was nice and greatly enhanced by the sauces.  From the negatives: I got stomach sick after (very unusual for me), and despite all the positives mentioned above, this is why I give it a one star. Maybe (hopefully) i just had an unusual bad batch."}
{"text":"every course tastes great! just like made in my hometown in China! The owner of the restaurant  Ms Ma is a very trustworthy lady, she uses fresh food material to make the courses, and she spend so much effort in running her business. It was very nice talking to her today, hope more people come here have a taste of the Original Chinese food!"}
{"text":"At Dumpling King we had salt and pepper shrimp, beef roll, scallion pancake and the lamb and beef potstickers. The salt and pepper shrimp had a nice flavor and a decent crunch. The beef roll was very good and I loved the homemade dough wrapper. The potstickers were nicely cooked but the flavors were muddled and not all that appealing. And finally the scallion pancake was quite simply inedible. The oil that the pancake was cooked in tasted old and burnt and was rancid. Service was a tad slow but very friendly."}
{"text":"Service is bad. She had an attitude and we were the first costumer of the day. Can you image how she's going to be the rest of the day. Food itself was ok not great. I can get better service at McD's and cheaper.   No tip either."}
{"text":"I fucking love this place. The fried pork and nappa cabbage is the bomb and owners are super nice or maybe because I am first laowai who speaks putong hua they seen lol"}
{"text":"You can come to try the fish stuff dumpling. But the wrapper is too thick! Won't go there again~"}
{"text":"The food (soup dumpling and the beef roll) that I order was really good. The waiter was nice. I would come back again."}
{"text":"dumplings are cheap, and delicious.   i live in the area, and this is one of the few places i keep coming back to."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and left disappointed. The dumplings here are priced pretty competitively with their competitors in the Chinatown area, but I've found that they offered the worst overall experience.  My party and I got a table right away when we arrived, as there were only 3 other parties there. Once we got seated, we were given menus, but not any tea or utensils. Even after placing our orders on the order sheet provided, we were left waiting for several minutes before the waitress even came to take our order.  Service was really slow, as there was only one waitress working the Friday lunch shift. With the amount of time it took for our food to get to our table, it felt like there was only one chef in the back making AND cooking the dumplings.  As for the taste of the dumplings, I felt that they were all pretty bland. My party and I shared the 'pork and napa', 'pork and chive', 'seafood', and 'beef and onion'. All of them of the steamed or boiled variety. Of all the dumplings that had vegetables in them, I didn't taste much of the vegetable, which usually adds flavour and texture to the dumpling filling. I felt that this was a miss on their part. Also, the dumpling skin was too thick on all the dumplings. At times, I felt that I was eating more dough than the meat inside the dumplings.  In summary, I would not recommend this place to anyone I know. The dumplings did not cut it. Instead, I'd recommend either Dumpling House Restaurant or Mother's Dumpling, if you're in the Chinatown area. For those with cars, the small dumpling restaurant in Metro Square (Warden and Steeles) is a better choice than the previously mentioned."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The green onion pancake was greasy, tasteless and bland. The beef steamed dumplings were salty and kept falling apart. They tasted like just salty meat balls. It was very disappointing. We were so hungry and the food still tasted bad. I will not be returning here. I really don't understand the hype for this place."}
{"text":"Best Chinese dumplings in town, hands down! The hot and sour soup is amazing as well. Be prepared to share the soup as the smallest size looks to be about a gallon. They recently got new ownership, but the food quality and taste haven't suffered in the least. The place is a well kept secret, but shouldn't be. The food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Hungry but feeling very indecisive, so got on the good ole trusted Yelp app. Really wanted din tai fong juicy dumplings in California. That's not happening. Yelped \"juicy dumplings\", got a few options. First stop was fat dumpling on spring mtn. Walked in and it smelled strange. Daughter was a lil grossed out so we left. Back to yelp. Found Dumpling King. Walked it to this very \"loud\" decorated place, only two other diners. Hmmmm.... Let's order small, try it out and if the first couple items are good we will order more. If not- we leave and yelp again. Needless to say we stayed and thanked the yelp gods for bestowing this delicious gem upon us! Holy smokes. The food was amazing. Different than most Chinese restaurants. We could not order everything that peeked out interest but I will tell you that everything we did order was on point. Just wonderful. The only item we did not get a photo of were the juicy beef dumplings (the reason we went here!) because we devoured them the minute they hit the table. Must try: juicy beef dumplings, leek pancakes, beef shumai, toffee taro, Crystal panfried dumplings, Teppan tofu. There were five of us dining and we are  kings, the bill got to the table 85 bucks! Wooooo hoooo??"}
{"text":"Overall pretty decent food, beef dumplings only though.  I came looking for soup dumplings, traditionally pork.  Dumplings in general were ok but the soup dumplings lacks soup"}
{"text":"Wow. This place really wow me. There MUST be something wrong with this place during our visit.  We went in this tiny restaurant and stood for 5 minutes waiting to be seated. The staff clearly saw us (yes we even looked into each others eyes) but without actually (i.e. effectually) seeing us. They even walked by a few times right in front of us.  There was one empty table with a glass of water left by previous customers. Ok so we took it. Again the staff saw us walking in and the sitting down but no one acknowledged us.   So we waved down one server to take the glass and he did, politely.  Then no one ever came back with menu or tea or water or anything. A few minutes later we waved down the guy again to ask for menu. Then we waved him down to place our order.   We ordered dumplings and some other simple items. Waited for over 30 minutes and nothing came. Then we finally managed to wave down another server and he said something none of us understood (seemed not English or Mandarin or Cantonese). Then 15 minutes. Waved down again to ask for food and the server never got back to us. Then 10 minutes. We stood up and left.   Most surprisingly, on our way out, the staff again saw us without actually seeing us. No one ever stopped us. Wow."}
{"text":"0 star. Waited 30 min for beef dumplings, by the time we finished the other two dishes, was told they were out of beef. Food is ok if you can stand the wait"}
{"text":"Excellent lamb potstickers. Had made and melt in your mouth. Take out was fast and staff was great."}
{"text":"I've had xiao long bao in Taiwan several times.  The version that they serve here isn't quite the same, but it is pretty good.  The main problem is that the dumplings are almost impossible to pick up without breaking them and leaking out the soup.  Nevertheless it was some of the best Chinese food I've had in the USA.  Very good service and reasonable prices.  A short drive from the strip.  I highly recommend to those who have never traveled to Asia but would like to try authentic Chinese food.  Not chicken chow main and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Found this place through my fellow foodies on Chowhound and let me tell you, this place is good! It's pretty small like the others have mentioned, just a few tables and no washroom, but the food is delcious. Everything tastes like it's been made from scratch, which I find so impressive and even more delicious! I love Ma/Pa shops like this. I would recommend their fish/seafood dumplings, steamed! It's probably better to get take-out because service is a tad slow but if you don't mind sitting around, then I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had MA LA TANG which is impressive even if it was in Beijing. Satisfying if you are craving for some ??? of hometown taste. It's very authentic and healthy. The soup base is tasty but not to much."}
{"text":"If you are looking for succulent dumplings with service to boot then sadly this is not the place to go. Whilst in Chinatown, my girlfriend and I stopped in at Dumpling King on a whim to order some chicken and vegetable pan fried dumplings. We were forced to wait about 30-45 minutes for one order of dumplings and the fact that there were only two other groups of patrons made us wonder what exactly was going on in the kitchen. But perhaps, we thought, the food would be worth the wait. Oh how wrong we were. One could have thrown dumpling ingredients at a damp wall and perhaps produced better dumplings than the dumping \"so called \" king. The dumplings were completely devoid of any vegetables so right off the bat it seemed like the kitchen cooks were inept. The dumpling was an oily, soggy mess. The batter was thick and tasteless. Even their soy sauce could not escape their special brand of ineptitude as it tasted like soy flavoured lemon juice. I would recommend that nobody try this place unless they truly hate their taste buds. The dumpling king has long left this place. They should change their name to the dumpling peasants."}
{"text":"Dumpling King is Amazing!! Very clean and great service and even better food!! This will be my new place for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"Dumpling King makes the most amazing dumplings I've ever had, they're very inexpensive as well. You also have the option to decide how you want your dumplings cooked. I usually get them boiled or steamed. The menu does have a lot of grammatical errors but it's not a big deal at all, it's actually quite comical.   The restaurant is very tiny, there's maybe 6 tables and there's usually one or two waiters but they're always very friendly. There is no washroom so if you want to wash your hands prior to eating bring a sanitizer instead and don't drink too much.   I'd definitely suggest coming here if you want some tasty dumplings and you can always take out if you don't want to stay in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy mother of wow! Actual szechuan food in Vegas? I would kill for more cumin lamb and dumplings."}
{"text":"This place has great cheap yummy dumplings. I can't pick a favourite flavour because I like 'em all! But you can never go wrong with Pork and Napa or Beef and Onion for $5.99. I always get steamed, not boiled (unless I'm doing pan-fried, of course) because the texture of the dumpling wrap is much better steamed. Boiled dumplings tend to get kind of slimy and soggy. Plus I can always buy frozen dumplings and boil them at home...steaming takes more equipment and skill so I leave that up to the professionals. It does take a hot second for the dumplings to be steamed though, so after ordering it takes about 10-15 minutes to get the food to the table.  I keep forgetting to take an exact count, but each plate of dumplings has about 15 medium-sized dumplings on them. If I'm hungry then I get one for myself, if I'm not very hungry and just want a snack then I'll split one plate between two people.  This place is tiny, with four or five little tables, all of IKEA plastic. I've only seen the restaurant, if you could call it that, entirely full once, on a Saturday/Sunday afternoon. It might have been a one-off thing. I came here last Saturday at 12:15 pm, and even though their sign says open at 12, they weren't open yet so I was the only one in there when they finally opened around 12:30."}
{"text":"It's astonishing this tiny establishment can manage to stay open.   Think of yourself in a 'restaurant' but serviced as if you're in a cheap Asian food court. We had to seat ourselves, and the sparse menu is plastered on the wall for all to see, with various spelling mistakes. The pictures of the dumplings are all the same, but with different labels (ie. pork, beef).   With one server running in and out of the back kitchen, I was correct to expect a long wait time for my dumplings.   The dumplings came out overcooked and I do not believe that they are \"made-to-order\". There was no flavor in the minced meat, which was wrapped with soggy dumpling skin.   You're better off buying a pack of frozen dumplings and cook them yourself at home - save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"The wait can be long, seating is limited (and often full at peak times), the decor is \"authentic\" like a food stall found in China (i.e. slightly better than a hole in the wall)...BUT hands down these are the BEST DUMPLINGS in Toronto.  I have searched high and low, and between the chewy texture of the hand made dumpling wraps paired with the flavourful fillings...well nobody has beat them...yet.  My absolute favourites are the Chive & Egg, and the Seafood.  I also love the cucumber salad (if you're not afraid of bad breath, or you're trying to ward off vampires).  Also, the chilli-oil sauce is terrific!  When I first started coming to Dumpling King, I thought the service was a little unfriendly, but later realized that the server/(owner?) is introverted and sometimes a bit awkward.  Over several visits, I have found him to be very humble, polite and endearing.  For example, as I stood up and had one last sip of tea, he said to me (in Chinese), \"Please, sit, sit.  You don't need to rush.\"    This is my go-to place when I want something simple and delicious.  I always get steamed or boiled, so I think it's pretty healthy too!  Oh Dumpling King...how I adore thee...let me count the ways..."}
{"text":"Was our first time here And it was really good! We got the juicy beef soup dumplings because we read about them on here and they lived up to the hype! We also got the fried beef noodles. They were so yummy!   The service was nice. They were very attentive and friendly. They kept my water glass full. You can see into the kitchen so you see them making the food. They have  glass windows where the noodles and dumplings are being assembled.   Pricing was also reasonable as well. It's served family style so the prices reflect that. The food is more than enough for the price.   Will be going back and trying something new when we do."}
{"text":"??(seafood) dumpling should be made with large chunks of shrimp, chives, eggs and pork, it is one of the most popular ways to make dumplings in China. Here, it is simply made with tiny shrimp bits and cabbage, and some individual dumplings skipped out on the shrimp part altogether. The wrap is also way too thick, further robbing the ? taste that was barely present to begin with. Absolutely disgraceful, far from what can be considered authentic dumplings. Filling but would honestly have rather spent the money on a Subway sandwich"}
{"text":"I consider myself a princess so it only seemed fitting that I came to the Dumpling King! We were a party of four and came here for dinner. To start, the decor here is overstimulating and has a Christmas/Chinese New Year feel to it all year 'round. On a good day, it's comical. On a bad day, it could be annoying. Definitely not the place to come if you have a headache or are hungover. To make matters worse, the bathrooms smelled like sewage. I definitely recommend to management that they fix this promptly, as it gives the restaurant an unclean atmosphere.  So we definitely didn't come here for the decor nor the ambiance. We came here for the food. I love XLB (soup filled dumplings). It's one of my favorite Asian dishes. We ordered the beef soup dumplings, leek dumplings, beef with green peppers, and the teppan tofu.   *Beef soup dumplings*: I was the most excited about this dish, but they were very disappointing. They did not come out hot, they came out warm. The meat wasn't tender or flavorful nor was there enough soup inside the dumpling. The skin was too thin and all together made for a pretty below average dumpling. Whomp whomp whomp!  *Teppan Tofu*: This dish came out sizzling hot off the wok, as it was still sizzling when it was placed on the table! This was the group favorite. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and paired nicely with the sauces and meat it was cooked in. Definitely my favorite dish.   *Beef with green pepper*: This came out still sizzling on the plate in front of us as well. It tasted exactly as expected, no surprises, pleasant or unpleasant.  *Leek Dumplings\": The second table favorite. The pancake outside was crispy and housed the inside leek filling well. With some black vinegar, the dumpling was very delicious.  The service was very slow. Our pot of tea was empty by the time all of the food had been brought to our table, however the refill did not come until just before the check came. The food here is average, but it does taste like home cooking. Unfortunately, although their name suggests that they are the \"Dumpling King\" I definitely wouldn't give them the crown. I would come here for anything but the soup filled dumplings (xlb) and would recommend the Teppan Tofu and the Leek Dumplings."}
{"text":"We Drove up to the new business for the first time and hesitated to go in bc there was no one in the restaurant but us, so we thought we give it a try anyway. We ordered beef dumpling, Steamed soup dumpling, and home made soup all tasted great. best dumpling in town, minus the loud red chair decor. Love the glass window to view chef Making their dumpling from scratch similar to Ding Tai Fung. Will be back for more juicy dumplings."}
{"text":"Wow. Even the dumpling dough and noodles are made from scratch. You can taste the love put into the food. the flavours are detailed and complex. Authentic home cooking. My new favorite for asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Accidentally came here. My husband and I were amazed by their delicious dumplings! Will visit again."}
{"text":"Hubs and I went there to get me a dumpling fix and, while it's a bit of a drive, I'm glad we went.  Parking was plentiful, the dining area is squeaky clean and the owner was very friendly and helpful.  There was some confusion about Hubs' order so we ended up with more food than we really wanted, but they removed one of the dishes from the tab, which made us happy.  Stone Dumplings: OMG, yum! Slightly better than standard pot stickers I've had, and the \"crust\" was perfect for absorbing the vinegar on my plate and seasoning these without having to dunk them in a pot of sauce.  Soup Dumplings: once again, OMG yum! Perfect little bite sized dumplings of soup and filling.  Do NOT make the mistake I did of trying to just bite into one, I got soup all over the table and myself.. it's amazing how much is in each of these little dumplings.  Meat Patty: rather like a seasoned burger inside a  tortilla, not sure what all is there but it was delicious (and I'm not a burger fan)  Chicken hot pot: one of Hubs' orders, and the one he regrets most because of the large pot of Sterno underneath which nauseated him and ruined the rest of the meal for him. I only got a small taste of that one, it was furiously hot and I was having a dumpling party, but it was good. Small pieces of chopped up chicken (bones and all) seasoned and in a pot with some shredded vegetables underneath.  Duck something: I didn't catch the full name of this dish, it wasn't on the menu but recommended by the owner.  Hubs ordered this, but wasn't able to eat due to the Sterno mentioned above.  I got a small taste, it was pretty excellent duck - cooked, sliced, laid out on a platter.  We'll definitely be going back, but we'll be avoiding the hot pot dishes for Hubs' sake.  The dumplings were just THAT good :D"}
{"text":"It's nothing compared to the Dumpling House in Boston, or basically any place on Mott St. in NYC, but these are the best dumplings you'll find in Vegas hands down."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for the jello noodles. Recently I guess they changed chef it was no longer the flavor I love, dumplings were okay, everything else was okay, nothing that's  can't live without."}
{"text":"Delicious quaint little location, fresh ingredients and friendly staff. Dumplings good and noodle bowl well done.   Good quick bite!"}
{"text":"Expected better, with a name like Dumpling King.  We order the beef soup dumplings and the skins were so thin that we could not get them out of the container without the soup coming out. The flavor was flat.  We order the beef roll burrito, it was ok, but the skin on the outside had a strange oily taste. We also had the leek pancake, which came so late, we thought they forgot them.  They were so bad we could not eat them, the taste was like freezer burn reheated.   We agree with the decor discussion, a bit confusing with all the Christmas decorations in Sept.  Either they love Christmas or are too lazy to take it down. We will not go back ."}
{"text":"We ordered a various selection of steamed dumplings, along with a fried chicken dumpling order and a bowl of noodles to go with it all. Beef and radish, Pork and green onion, and as well a bowl of wonton seafood dumplings in soup broth. While all the food was good, nothing stood out until I tried the tofu noodles. Wow! There's a dish that I haven't tried before and thoroughly enjoyed. Thin strands of tofu noodles made with a serrated edge giving it a unique look and texture. Slightly tougher than other noodles, it was served at room temperature and with a blessing of hot chilli granules. Wonderful flavour and texture! I would pass on the plain noodles again as the broth was more like hot water with a few veggies thrown in. Best was probably the beef/radish steamed dumplings if you savour a rich meaty dumpling to help warm you up. Service was cheerful and pleasant and I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by the average decor of the place, easily one of the best northern Chinese cuisines I've ever had anywhere outside of mainland china. The wontons, dumplings, and porridges are all excellent. Very authentic and highly recommend.  Do be aware cash only for spend below 20, otherwise credit cards accepted"}
{"text":"This dumpling place is awesome and the owner is so nice!  The seafood dumpling is fantastic (especially when fried)   Super tiny and very limited seating like other reviewers have already mentioned, but very cozy in the wintertime."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I enjoyed every thing my friend had ordered haha I do not really know what to order, so I had to trust my friend's judgment. We ended up getting four or five orders of beef meat dumplings - they were really juicy and tasty. Make sure you ask for hot sauce! (they don't have sriracha though). We then got a couple orders of the same type of beef meat on the inside but it was fried this time. It looked really cool when it came out. It looked like there was a spider web of some sort on top of the dumplings. It was really crunchy and good. Make sure you blow on it a couple times because its mucho mucho hot on the inside. My boyfriend bit into it too fast and screamed...lolol unless you want some sort of entertainment hahahah We then got an order of the fried salt and pepper shrimp. It is a good blend of seasoning and cooked right. Some people peel off the skin then eat it, but i prefer to just put the whole thing in my mouth - that's where all the flavor is! I can't eat the heads tho :x  If you're looking for a dumpling place, I would recommend trying this place! It's the closest thing youre gonna get to din tai fung in california!"}
{"text":"Homemade, fresh and very authentic dumplings!! We were so happy to find the new location of Dumpling King. We always order a bunch of noodles and dumplings to share.  Our favorite items are:  -- pan fried pork and Napa dumplings: unique, delicious, and no other dumpling places are like it in Toronto -- chicken & veg dumplings, either boiled or steamed -- seafood dumplings, boiled -- chef's recommendation. We were skeptical initially but ended up loving it -- beef & noodles: it is more like a soup and PERFECT for a winter day. Very simple and perfect. I crave this soup often.  We would come to their old location multiple times a week. We took out Chinese friends and family here too - all to rave reviews! !  The family that runs the restaurant is super sweet too! You also get complimentary green tea.  Very reasonable prices -- almost too reasonable!  Perfect for grad student budget :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome cucumber & potato side dishes to start.  Steamed Dumplings were good & at a fair price. Fried dumplings & chive/egg pancakes were quite unique. Lastly, the beef noodle soup was simple & delicious."}
{"text":"for the record: this is NOT the other Dumpling King. This one is situated in the middle of a 4 condo driveway, just south of Yonge & Finch. I've never been to the other one, so I can't compare, but there are great dumplings to be found here!  facts:  - service is slow and relies a lot on the pointing to items on the menu, if you can't speak Mandarin. - i think they prep and cook dumplings as they're ordered.  - for take-out, i advise calling ahead and giving at least 25 minutes for your order to be ready. - take-out is a good option as there's very limited seating - seating is simply folding chairs, tables are tidy and that's all - there is no bathroom - most varieties of dumplings can be had either boiled, deep-fried, or steamed. they are all delicious. - manner of cooking changes the taste and texture of \"skins\" only, not the filling - \"skins\" are doughy and substantial, without overpowering the filling usually... - fish fillings are better in the steamed and boiled versions, and can't hold up to the flavour of deep-fried fat - pork fillings work by all methods - deep-fried, NOT pan-fried - approximately 16 big-bite sized dumplings (think, two bite brownies) per order - apart from a good selection of dumplings, there are also appetizers, noodles, and a couple of other items.  two can easily eat for less than $20."}
{"text":"The bright red floral chair covers here are easily the focal point of the dining room!  Decorative choices aside, the food is good and made with love! The restaurant name is a bit misleading, as they do offer several dumplings (arguably more than anywhere else in town?) but that does not seem to be their strongest dish. Note that the owners are Muslim and do not serve pork products.   The cumin lamb was easily my favorite dish of the night! Juicy meat with grilled peppers and onions, with plenty of cumin seasoning and cilantro. A must-order. Other standouts include the hot oil and fish dish (can't remember the exact name), and the braised shrimp with sweet potato and bean sprouts. The blistered green beans are a safe side, and done well.   About the dumplings: the juicy beef soup dumplings were both beefy and juicy, if you cold manage to get them without tearing. The lamb dumplings are the ones I was most looking forward to, and they were a bit bland. We tried one or two more varieties, and their flavors weren't really as distinct and robust as I'd hoped. I guess we shouldn't have spent so much time taking photos and talking, it seemed the quality went down as they cooled.    Made reservations for a large group, and they were able to accommodate us- we moved to their large party room in the back and set up the tables to account for additional people, and the space worked well. I would bring a group here again in the future!"}
{"text":"I came by after watching Kung Fu Panda 3. . .and if you saw it. . .you would know why I was craving dumplings.  LOL  The food sadly was disappointing.  I ordered a lot as I wanted to get a variety and have leftovers of course.  =)  I got their Chive dumplings and I have to say that the ones at Noddle Man on Rainbow were hands down better. (2.5/5)  I also got their soup dumplings and it was decent.  It was not the worst but it was definitely not the best which is what you would expect from a restraunt called \"Dumpling King\". . .=( (3/5)  Then I got their fried tofu with Green Peppers.  They put so much ginger in it that I could not taste anything else but the ginger.  (1/5)  Service was good.  The girl that took my order was prompt and very friendly.  (5/5)  Ambiance was interesting to say the least.  I read somewhere that the chair covers were handmade by the owner. . .it was a little garish to my eyes but to each his own.  =)  (4/5)  Now you may wonder why the 1 star rating. . .well. . .the rating stands since about 4 hours after eating dinner here, I was in the bathroom throwing up everything that I had eaten.  Food poisoning at its worst.  This is now 3 days later and my stomach still has not full recovered from it.    So will I be returning here?  I am sadly going to say that it will be a big fat no.  The food wasn't that great and with the food posioning that I got from here. . .that is a big red flag for me to never return.    I reallty wanted to like this place as I love me some dumplings. . .but I can't get over the puking portion of my dinner here.  =("}
{"text":"Great place. Generous portion sizes and tasty ingredients. The soups are definitely meant to be shared. We tried three dumplings and the fried pork was the one we liked the best. Service was fast. Note it's cash only and the parking outside is highly monitored best if you pay and display."}
{"text":"Came in late September. -There were a ton of mosquitoes inside (they keep  the door open cause theres no AC). They were biting several people including my party. The owner tried to kill a few but there were too many  -it's hot inside. No AC. What's worse is that they don't even give water (see next comment)  -they DONT GIVE WATER?!?!? This is the 1st time I've been to a place that doesn't give water. Is that even legal?? For this very reason, I will never eat there again.   -food takes a long line time to come out.   These guys are really keeping costs to a minimum... no AC, no water, insufficient staff in the kitchen? I'm ok with low costs if the prices are low, but these prices are pretty similar to what you'd pay in Chinatown (except that comes with luxuries like water). Wouldn't exactly call it \"cheap\" as some other reviews did. Sure, cheap compared to sushi, but it's dumplings we are talking about.   Cash only"}
{"text":"In China, there are many ethnic groups. This restaurant's Chinese name indicates that they are of the Hui Race. The Hui race is essentially of Muslim religion. Pork is not eaten.  As such I expect a very different style of cooking and ethnic variety - mainly mutton and beef dishes with various hot spice flavor.   My wife and I visited this place for lunch.   This is a relatively small size restaurant. All the tables and chairs are covered with a flower  patterned red cloth. Certainly, very different than the traditional Chinese eateries.   Since it is lunch, we ordered:  1. Onion Pancake - $6.99. Good flavor and size. But nothing really to brag about. A solid B.   2. Chicken and Potato in a Hot Clay Pot - $7.99. A Lunch Special. This is a clay pot with chicken ( with bones and skin ) cooked in a brown sauce with chunks of potato. Unfortunately, there is little or no flavoring.  Price is reasonable but still only a D.  3. Toothpick Beef - $14.90. This is a special Chef recommended dish. This is actually a very interesting dish -- pieces of cooked beef skewered on to tooth picks. A very tedious way of presentation. Flavor is interesting as it has various middle eastern type of spice mixed in. Degree of \"Hotness\" is actually quite acceptable. I am OK with this dish but my wife has issues. I venture to guess some folks will like this type of flavoring while others may not. Therefore this dish cannot be graded.  I wish this restaurant luck as it seems to cater only to a special group of customers. I am reluctant to grade this eatery, although tentatively I have offered a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"We ordered 1 style of each dumpling which are: boiled, steamed and pan fried. Only 4 of the dumpling flavours are available as pan fried. All of the flavours can be ordered boiled or steamed.   The boiled seafood dumpling had 1-2 tiny shrimps in each dumpling and the filling was 90% ground napa or cabbage. Steamed egg and chive was quite salty. The balance of egg and chive was off... with an overemphasis of very large and fibrous pieces of chives. (Aside: the ideal egg and chive dumpling should be 40% egg, 55% tender finely chopped chive, 5% 'shrimp skin'). Of the bunch, the pan fried chicken and vegetable dumplings probably came out best. However, pan fried costs $1 more and the dumpling size was smaller as well."}
{"text":"The Skinny: the food is subpar (2) service: pretty much non existent... even for a Chinese joint which is saying something (1) value: there really isn't much value in bad food and poor service (2).  How to begin?   We hit this joint on Christmas day with the parental units who had come from out of town. We had called ahead to reserve a table at 6:30pm. It was a good thing we called ahead and made reservations but I am not sure if we just lucked out because there was no reservation card on our table.   We were seated promptly but that was about the only thing we got in a timely manner.   Menus? Sorry we only have 3 menus in the restaurant and someone else is using it so you have to wait. Hot water? Sorry we don't have hot water only tea.(yeah...WTF, right?) Tea? Oh yeah sorry,  we forgot it. Oh and not to mention that several items on the menu were not available.   Of what was left, we tried their lamb soup, stir-fried beef,  yellow croaker with tofu,  home style tofu, potstickers, Mongolian pancakes. We ordered two additional dishes however one of them they forgot to add it to our tab so it never got made. The second one they ran out but forgot to tell us.   Okay let's get down to the details.   Potstickers were nothing special. The wrappers were too thick,and lacked the crispy bottom. Plus they skimped on the filling.   Lamb soup was okay - it was a chicken based soup with vermicelli, nappa cabbage and cilantro. This was a decent dish.   Mongolian pancakes had minimal filling and were really soggy and doughy.   The stir-fried dishes had way too much goopy sauce and were overly salty. The yellow croaker fish dish was especially offensive.   Between the lackluster dishes and the poor service I see no reason to return. Honestly,  the only reason they get a 2 starred review is because the food was at least edible but not palatable."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews I'm not sure we're talking about the same place here! I come here all the time and it's the best. Hand made dumplings always served steaming fresh and quickly. It's CHEAP! I get full on $6 worth of dumplings but I always order extras to take home. It's always quite empty when I come here to eat, and the staff is average. They serve super authentic northern chinese food, so it's understandable that they lack some of the sweet-ass dipping sauces  you southerners like. Honestly I'm sick of the Chinese food =sweet and sour chicken bs.   Tldr: hefty ass juicy dumplings for cheap, average service, average atmosphere. Very authentic chinese experience."}
{"text":"I normally don't write any reviews but must write for this restaurant. Been in Vegas for more than 3 years, this is the only authentic Chinese restaurant that focus on Northeast Chinese cuisine. Love all the dishes and remind me home across the Pacific Ocean. You gotta try!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little find. Everything is made fresh but there is not a long wait. Very attentive service. We had dumplings, wonton soup and cucumber salad. Cucumber salad was a delicious accompaniment to the soup and dumplings- cold, fresh, sweet with a bit of chilli heat. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Sad to report that in the last 2 years things have gone downhill for my fave regal hole-in-the-wall. I suspect that the palace is pinching pennies because not only is the tea no longer a strong, hot jasmine (it's now usually vaguely tea-flavoured water), but the dumpling skins have gotten so thick that I'm pretty sure I had a wonton that was 100% wrapper yesterday.  I'll probably commit treason and scope out a new regular dumpling place in the neighbourhood next time."}
{"text":"Soup dumpling were good but stuck to the paper in the steam basket so we lost most of the soup :(  The lamb noodle soup was pretty bland and only had a single small slice of meat. Leek pancakes were like a giant fried dumpling not like the photo in the menu. May go back if I don't find a better soup dumpling place."}
{"text":"Great food and service - will make sure to eat here at each trip to Vegas. We had a party of 15 and the staff was able to accommodate us without any issues"}
{"text":"We all know the famous Chinese proverb, \"He who depends on himself will attain the greatest order of dumplings.\" Still, few actually realize this experience with dumplings as good as the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings at Dumpling King!  I have been to Dumpling King a few times in small parties, but finally had the opportunity to come in with a large group of wonderful friends to try a ton of dishes family style...we were so satisfied and glad we came here. Dumpling King consistently impressed me dish after dish. I know we did our homework and ordered some of their more popular items, but I still couldn't believe how much I enjoyed every item we shared.   Dishes that I absolutely recommend include:  Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings Fried Lamb w/ Cumin Spicy Laoganma Sauced Eggplant Teppan Tofu Vegetable or Shrimp Fried Noodles Fried String Beans  Other dishes that we've enjoyed include:  Lamb Boiled Dumplings Boiled Shrimp Egg and Leek Dumplings Crystal Beef Grilled Dumplings  Conditional recommendations: Baked Yoked Coated Pumpkin if you like pumpkin or backed yolk Toffee Taro if love sweet taro and don't mind taking the chance of loosing a tooth Spicy Cold Noodles if you're into it (in the words of  Bret and Jemaine)  Some have argued the merit if their name... dumplings aren't necessarily the mainstay of their menu... they have a few varieties, but not a royal selection. I can understand others linguistic sentiments on those grounds, but then again the XLB dumplings are the most consistent and my favorite in town!... and I've certainly tried all the good XLB dumplings in town. Dumpling King's are different though in that theirs are made with beef instead of pork. I am a fan of pork XLB but the superior soup, wrapper, and consistently put Dumpling King on top...for Vegas anyway.   Simply put, Dumpling King is basically what you'd expect from your above-average Northern Chinese Muslim restaurant. ...which is in fact different from the typical Chinese restaurant, so don't expect the usual here."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times. I guess their dumplings are made to order? This would explain why there's a 20-25 minute wait time for a food item that's fast to cook.   Aside from this annoyance, I highly recommend this restaurant. The dumplings are delicious (I'm not sure if made to order makes such a big difference). The price is very reasonable. If I recall it's about 18 dumplings for 6.99 or 5.99? That's a steal compared to certain Japanese and Korean restaurants (but note that Japanese, Korean dumplings are different from Chinese dumplings). For 2 people, 2-3 orders of dumplings would be more than adequate. If you want something aside from dumplings, they have a few appetizers as well.   I like how you can specify whether you want your dumplings steam/boiled/fried. This makes it a true dumpling house.   The restaurant is small and only has about 4-5 tables. It has a very family-like atmosphere which I enjoy. I never had problems with gettign a table despite the small size as it seems like many people phone in to get take-out."}
{"text":"This is relative to similar restaurants.  Was considering 2 stars.  Rating based on the food and how we felt afterwards. But if you are from out of town, I would not recommend wasting a precious meal here.  Beef soup dumplings (not very good.  not terrible but just not worth eating) Crystal pan fried dumplings (same comment) Beef roll/chinese burrito (actually really good but a little light on the meat) Leek pancakes (not bad) Braised eggplant (tasty, but oily and not a hard dish to make) String beans (tasty, but oily) Shrimp hand tossed noodles (wife liked it, i thought the noodles were too mushy)  If you're local, maybe you eat here out of convenience.  It's not terrible but I wouldn't come here again.  Their service was excellent though.  And very accomodating to families with kids."}
{"text":"The positive reviews are about this place concerning the dumplings are spot on! Delicious \"home-styled\" dumplings. I got the pan fried pork and chive dumplings and they were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in town.  Their fish dumplings and fried seafood dumplings are amazing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good beef noodle and excellent xiao long bao. Not bad for Vegas.  Still not 626 but very enjoyable. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Really great authenticate food. Great service,  varied prices but well it. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Based on the other two reviews here I tried this place and loved it! Their reviews were accurate (thanks!) and I went with some of the suggested orders and more. Two of us ate (eek, and finished!):  -deep-fried pork dumplings  -steamed fish dumplings -shrimp wontons in broth -noodle soup (hand-pulled) -cucumber salad side -celery salad side  Portions are generous indeed. 2 can definitely dine for under $20 although our bill somewhere under $40 because we ordered enough for 3 - 4 people.  The male owner is lovely - friendly, eager to improve his English and try to communicate with his customers. I get the feeling that if you wanted anything specific you could tell him and he would try and accommodate for future.  If you come here knowing what to expect, you will enjoy it more (ie/not in a rush, knowing it's a mom/pop place, not needing a washroom.    One additional comment on the dumplings and noodles: you can definitely taste the homemade feel. This means you won't find thin, even skins; but rather, thicker, fluffier, bouncier, fresh doughy goodness.   I will definitely be back to try all the other flavoured dumplings in various formats (boiled, steamed, deep-fried)."}
{"text":"Dumplings here were $9.99 for 10 small dumplings. Skin was perfect, meat was good but broth was lacking. There just wasn't enough of it."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to find a dumpling place with decent tasting veggie dumplings.  They are a small business that offers very reasonably priced dumplings. Conveniently located south of yonge and finch. They don't offer excellent service or decor but they deserve 5 stars for the price, quantity and location."}
{"text":"*Fascinating Mom/Pop Dumpling experience*   After eating here at Dumpling King, I believe one of the West-coast \"Hole in the Wall\" Yelper would eat this up. Never got to meet him, at least I think he's a HIM. I'm sending you off the beaten path if you visit T.O.   Steamy condensation'd windows block off any judgement for passers-by as to what's happening inside. Open the door to see a handful of rudimentary tables outfitted with clear-plastic covers and basic plastic folding chairs that might make 200 pounders fear of splattering all over the floor making a scene. 3.5'd   I saw the Chinese Mandarin-speaking Man in full Chef's Whites coming and going. He is a busy-bee handling what seemed to be everything. He must have a Dumpling Queen at the back too, to help his cause. Menu consist of various Dumplings(Steamed, Boiled or Fried), Noodles, Side Dishes, Wontons, Drinks.   - Seafood Wonton($4.99). Wonton wrap holds together unless chopsticks skills are limited-to-none. The filling is fresh and has good response. I think the only thing was that the soup base was slightly heavy on the White Pepper.   - Chicken & Vegetable Dumpling(Fried $6.99). Deep Fried for that matter and it looked like Cantonese Kok Zai(New Year Crispy Dumpling). Reminds me of eating Deep Fried Chicken Wings(Boneless). The exterior providing crispness while the interior provides Chicken Meat mousse.   - Pork & Napa Dumplings(Steamed $5.99). Steamed does transfer more of the well-seasoned fillings to your tastebuds compared to Boiled where it slightly waters the flavours down. If you like to taste stronger flavour of the filling within, this is your choice.   - Beef & Onion Dumplings(Boiled $5.99). Boiled gives subtlety and balance for people with sensitive tastebuds. I like to think it as the Healthy alternative from all the cooking methods, but that's just me. The Beef flavour is quite noticeable in comparison to Pork or Chicken but usually not typically ordered over the other more popular proteins.   *Warning*   Dishes take TIME(!) and come far and few like typical Home Cooking for multiples.  Service can take just as much time but you can see Chef giving his best effort.  200 sq ft room space means not suitable for large groups(4+). There's a table for \"1\" like they know I'll be back sometime."}
{"text":"I feel like I found hidden treasure. The lady up front was so friendly. Everything was fresh and delicious. We ordered an absurd amount of dumplings to fill our dumpling craving and it was met and some. I'm sad I didn't know this placed existed before!  The boiled lamb dumplings are great and I'm a huge lamb fan. The crystal (stone) dumplings were so tasty! The beef soup dumplings and leek dumplings were also delicious.   It took a bit of time to get everything but they make everything fresh to order and knowing that I would wait as long as it takes not to get a frozen garbage dumpling. I wish I could give them more stars!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Ordered one steam dumpling, one pan fried dumpling, a spicy noodle, and peanut pancake. All very good. Service was good two and prices reasonable. Better than many places in Scarborough and Markham."}
{"text":"Odd decor, almost had a Central Asia feel to it, but the beef soup dumplings made it work the trip.  We tried a variety of potstickers and were full in no time.  It wasn't packed in here, but the service was decent and food was great."}
{"text":"I don't know how they get those high rates. I don't like it.  Ordered beef noodle. Only comes with four pieces of stew beef. Like vietnamese beef noodle soup better.  Price is worth for the taste and service.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"On our way to a midweek IMAX movie, the love of my life and I decided it would be ideal to stop in Chinatown for Dumplings. We had plans to try out Yummy Yummy. However, upon realizing it was closed, and being caught in the rain, we opted for the next closest dumpling option: Dumpling King.  We were met immediately upon sitting with menus and hot tea. We decided to focus strictly on dumplings, ignoring all other menu options, and picked Veggie - Boiled (light and fluffy), Egg and Chive - Steamed (slightly crunchy and flavourful) and Seafood - Deep Fried (Bursting with flavour and not-at-all oily).  The dumplings were served within minutes, and we got right down to business. The sweetish chilli oil was the perfect accompaniment for all three.   The Dumpling King delivered exactly as advertised. Other reviews mention a lacking in presentation, but for those of us who can separate flavour from appearance, it makes no difference. It's a big plate of dumplings for 5-7 dollars, the service is quick and the dumplings are hot. Will absolutely stop in again."}
{"text":"was walking through chinatown a few weeks ago and saw this new dumpling house open up... and i, being the dumpling glutton i am, had to drag my GF and friend to try it out... tried out 3 boiled types (seafood - shrimp, pork and nappa, and pork and celery) and a deep fried deep fried version... as well as a side of cucumber salad... the boiled celery and pork were great! as good as the dumpling House's... the other 2 types of boiled were also very good... the deep fried was unusual... ive never seen a fully deep fried version before! pan fried are the norm but this place doesnt even offer a pan fried variety... still very tasty! the selection of dumplings is fairly decent but not extensive as dumpling house or mothers... but the restaurant is less crowded than Dumpling house and not filled with hipsters and university kids like Mothers... go again? more than likely! oh and i believe the prices were in line with the competition... if not a little cheaper...."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The owner greeted us and made recommendations. She served us tea while we waited for our to-go dumplings, and even gave us samples of chicken wings & dumplings. Such a sweet lady.  The dumpling wrapper is delicious. I would definitely recommend this place. Especially since they are open until 3am. Apparently the owner changed the hours."}
{"text":"Soooooo....  I've been there twice.  The first time was great- even though you cannot order a simple glass of water. They insist on tea and tea only. The food was great (loved the beef and potatoes, wonton soup and cucumber with flavor- my friends loved the dumplings).  Now, the first time was so great, we thought that we must go back again a week later.  Big mistake.  Horrible service. The cucumber literally had zero 'flavor' on it. I ordered beef and potatoes again and they actually waited 30 minutes to come out and tell me that they were out and to order something else.  I ordered the 'beef with flavor' instead.  They waited another 10 minutes and told me they were out of that, too.  I sat there for 40 minutes and only had wonton soup and a couple of pieces of cucumber.  I ordered rice at the beginning and it never even showed up.  Who lets people order and then tells them 30-40 minutes later that they can't make it?  Get it together.  Not to mention that they just had like a million infractions on blogTO's restaurant safety violation list.  Don't go back.  It's not worth it.  Go to Pho Pasteur instead!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best dumplings in town Have tried a few all around Toronto and they have the best dumplings for the best price"}
{"text":"This review is for rude service and their noodle bowls. We went in around 12:30am, we were the only customers. Two of my friends ordered the beef stew, one ordered the beef tender noodle bowl, and I ordered the lamb noodle bowl. We had asked what size it was, she replied that it was \"regular size\". We asked if two people could share, she said \"I don't know how hungry you are\" in a very disdainful way.  When our orders came out, the beef tender bowl looked like beef tendons, there was no actual red meat, all of it were tendons. My friend then asked if that was the beef tender bowl, she replied with \"yes that's how beef tendon is\" and just walked away. The broth was far from appetizing and the noodles in my order were still raw and chewy. We left the restaurant with our food unfinished and still hungry, it was that terrible. Sorry Dumpling King, if it wasn't for the very rude service, I would have given you a second chance to actually try your dumplings, no bueno!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, we had veggie chicken and pork sauerkraut dumplings. We had rice and noodles and beef soup for under $25, huge portions and friendly service."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend. I was excited to try this place and all their assortments of dumplings. I thought they would Have more selections when it came to dumplings. We weren't familiar with the menu and later found out it was a Muslim Chinese restaurant. We didn't know what else to order or what else would be good?  All we ordered were the \"juicy soup beef dumplings\" , and a side of rice. The soup dumplings were ok, a bit sour and it could have definitely been more hot. It got kind of got cold once it hit my mouth.  It was worth trying, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yes, 5 friggin' stars...I love this place!  Dumpling King is a hidden gem in every sense. Nearly every time we've been here, their huge supposed to be lit sign out front is either off or broken, and the place nearly looks deserted besides a car or two in the parking lot. It probably doesn't help either, that if you're heading West on Spring Mountain, it's almost impossible to see with it being tucked behind a large plaza building. Plus, I don't see advertisements for them anywhere, and for whatever reason, the amount of reviews on this place is crazy low. It's like people just don't they are there...but why? It's so good!  Our first trip to Dumpling King was admittedly a little nerve-wrecking. Besides not having a clue where it was, or really having never heard about it at all, it was strange walking into a place that was pretty much empty of other diners, but full of bright floral designs...and Christmas decorations. Yup, Christmas decorations. Which as of now, July, are still up in subtle spots across the restaurant. But really, it's all part of the charm for me now. I like the decor, decorations and all, and the place is always clean.  The menu is large, and has plenty of things to choose from. Some things that I can't even read. Luckily we've been here a couple times with regulars who have pointed us in the right direction on what to order. I'm pretty sure we've barely even put a dent in the list of items, but now that we've been here a handful of times, there are some things I can confidently recommend.  For smaller items that you can start with while you're deciding on what to eat, order the String Beans. A large plate of fresh beans with dried peppers and tons of flavor, it's likely to be a hit with anyone who has working tastebuds. And of course, as the name would imply, they have excellent dumplings. We've tried a couple different types here, but we always seem to go back to the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings. Even my 6 year old can't get enough of these things. A little vinegar and/or chili paste just sets them off even more. How they can pack that much flavor and juice into those little things is beyond me. But, if you want to get some idea, you can watch them being hand made in a little room to the right of the kitchen. That's also where they make one of other favorites, the Vegetable Fried Noodles. Thick, handmade noodles served perfectly cooked and piled high with veggies.   There's probably not enough room with the character limit for me to get to everything, but for larger \"main course\" type stuff, some must try dishes are the Fried Lamb w/ Cumin, and our new found item added to the favorites list, Black Pepper Beef. Both of these dishes are packed with tons of flavor, fresh and perfectly cooked meat that's piled high for plenty of sharing.  I've also had a number of items that I likely wouldn't have ordered myself, due to sheer skepticism, but ended up really liking. One of which is the Teppan Tofu, mainly because I don't normally get tofu anywhere. But it, just like pretty much everything else on their menu is packed with flavor and comes in a huge portion. The other thing I really enjoyed, but probably wouldn't have ordered was the Baked Yoked Coated Pumpkin. Don't get me wrong, I like pumpkin, but it just doesn't have a ring to it. Flavorwise though, it doesn't disappoint. It's almost like a dessert french fry, even more so because there's no way you can eat just one.  When it comes to the food, there really hasn't been a single thing at Dumpling King that I haven't liked. And if there was any negatives to this place whatsoever, it's the hit and miss service. Usually the biggest issue is getting refills here. For whatever reason, they like to take their time with getting you water. We also had a weird little interaction on our last visit, which was our 4th time here, where the main waitress (I think owner) asked if we needed forks. I mean...c'mon, I know I'm a white boy, but you've seen me here before...I know how to use some dang chop sticks lady. Well, sort of. Good enough to eat at least.   Overall, DK is easily one of, if not my favorite restaurant in the area. Every time we come here, the food is excellent, and large groups can split tons of food that really isn't that expensive. Like I said...hidden gem, check it out!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Came here on a Friday evening and it was empty and dead silent. At least play some music...  We weren't offered tea - had to ask for it. Got the seafood dumplings (FYI they are pork and shrimp. I understood seafood dumpling to be seafood only). They tasted OK and were nothing special. When I asked for hot sauce, we were given a small plate and a bottle of expired sriracha. Yes, expired since 2016.  We also had the tofu noodles which were bland and a small serving size for the price. The texture and bland taste made the experience feel as if we were eating warm rubber bands.  Tried the chive pancakes which had a nice texture but no taste. They were as bland as the noodles.  Overall, I think this place is definitely overrated and I would not return."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews! I have been to many dumpling joints that have served soup aka juicy dumplings and this place is the BEST I've ever had. This is the most soup I've seen in a dumpling ever!! The green onion pancakes were also very fluffy and the serving was generous. It was my third time there and I would definitely return!!  They are great for take out as well. Very friendly, offering you water and tea while you wait for your order!"}
{"text":"The dumping and the noodles there are really good, not the main dishes. Just be careful...it's extremely slow. You have to wait for more than 25 mins just for dumplings!"}
{"text":"For being the self-proclaimed dumpling king, I would have expected way more dumplings.  We had the juicy beef dumplings, no pork option.  Salty meat and thicker skin than I prefer.  The string beans were money though.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had the onion pancake but did not like them too much because they were too bready and not as greasy and flaky as I am used to.  Everything here is freshly cooked to order.    The whole time I was here they played Calvin Harris \"Blame\" on repeat.  That was the worst part."}
{"text":"After eating brunch, some friends and I thought it would be good to do a soup dumpling eating challenge...so we found this place out and thought it would be good to try it out. When going in there,  the place was pretty empty, with only 2 other tables. We ordered 4 servings of soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were beef ones,  which I am not accustomed to. They were mediocre at best.    What irks us was that it took awhile for the 3 orders to come out...and then like 10 minutes later for the last order.  We asked for spoons to help eat the dumplings (kinda hard to eat it with just chopsticks)...the spoons never came, we had to get it ourselves. We were contemplating on ordering more dumplings, but the main lady didn't seem to care much about taking our order...so we just asked for our check (and that took awhile to get).  Overall..the dumplings are about a 3/5...but with the lack of service...drops it to 2..."}
{"text":"Wow!   We did not expect this place to be anything, we had a craving my friend and I and yelped it up! Found this spot and were pleasantly surprised!   The service was fantastic   Everything fresh!   And Greta prices and portions!   We will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I just got back from another delicious meal at Dumpling King, and can not fathom how this restaurant got some of the negative reviews that it did.  I live in New York, so I am used to good quality Chinese food.  My son's friend recommended Dumpling King so we decided to give it a try. I am always leery about trying new places, but am s glad I did. From start to finish the food has been delicious. Fresh, tasty, hot from the kitchen and reasonably priced. I couldn't ask for more. The owner, Merry, is lovely and speaks English beautifully, so if you have any questions she will be more than happy to answer them. Some of the dishes we enjoyed were the potstickers, beef dumplings, brisket, sweet and sour beef, and fried noodles with chicken. The bill for all that food for four people was $60 with lots to bring home! The decor is festive and bright. If you are expecting Panda Express, then you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a good, high-quality meal then go to Dumpling King. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Food = 2 stars.  We ordered several dumplings, steamed and fried. The fillings all seemed to come out as soup dumplings. Their Korean cold noodle was my fav. It had more flavor than all the dumpling dishes.   Lamb dumpling tasted very game-y/stinky. Lamb is hard to perfect, granted, but this dish was hard to swallow.   Service was similar to a typical Asian restaurant, nothing really bad to say if you don't expect much.   Decor was very flashy, bright red (with prints) chair covers and red paper lanterns covering the ceiling lights."}
{"text":"I am a fan for their hand-pulled noodles!  Hubby wanted some soup dumplings so we decided yesterday that we will try out DK for lunch today.  We arrived and notice that Christmas décor was up.  Wondered if DK celebrated Christmas all year round or they are just super excited for Christmas and already put up the decorations.  The restaurant's chairs were all covered with red flowered fabric.  Lots of red everywhere.  Hurts the eyes a bit.  Chairs were uncomfortable.  Onto the food: - Beef Soup Dumplings: We thought this was ok.  We definitely had better. Couldn't really taste the soup in these medium sized dumplings.  We will pass on this next time. -Teppan Tofu:  We had to ask for some steam rice to eat with this.  The sauce was very flavorful.  The tofu were soft inside and somewhat crispy on the outside.  I thought this was above mediocre. -Shrimp Fried Noodle:  The hand-pulled noodle is the best hand-pulled cooked noodle I have tasted to date.  The texture and chewiness was perfect.  The shrimps were perfectly cooked as well.  I have had my share of overcooked shrimp and it can kill a dish.  Not at DK!    We also had to order a pot of hot tea.  We did noticed that another family of 3 that came in after us was given hot tea and steam rice without having to ask for them.  *Shrug  Additionally, we had to wait 45 mins to get our noodle and tofu dish.  The lady owner did apologize for the wait since her husband had to run out to the store to buy veggies for the dish.  But, it's ok.  She was very kind and we didn't mind waiting.  Overall, this is a 3.5 star restaurant to us.  We will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"We celebrated a cool dudes birthday, so we attacked everything family style. Green Beans, Cold Noodles, Lamb with Cumin, Teppan Tofu, Eggplant, Vegetable Hand Cut Noodles, Yolk Coated Crispy Pumpkin, and my favorite Soup Dumplings in town for the fact that everywhere else you find Soup Dumplings in town,  it's with pork, and I don't really care for that taste. The Toffee Taro at the end was interesting and not bad...Luckily no one lost a tooth!  Everything we ordered was delicious, service was great, the company was even better, and we've already been back again. It's a shame that it's not busier here knowing that their noodles and dumplings are made from scratch.  I am not an expert in Chinese cuisine, but I know that every dish we ordered had its own delicious flavor and that everyone left very satisfied. Service was pleasant, portions are generous, and prices here are very reasonable. Give Dumpling King a try if you haven't already.  ALOHA! ! !   Shaka Meter: \uuu/  \uuu/   \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"I was craving soup dumplings and saw this Dumpling King on yelp so my bf and I decided to give it a try. I liked the tables and chair, my bf and I noticed that they had Christmas decorations up as well and I just guessed it was one of those places that kept up their decorations year round. Anyways we got tea, beef patties, beef soup dumplings, regular beef dumplings, and shrimp fried noodles. The tea was very refreshing and the shrimp fried noodles were very good. My bf liked the beef patties, however when I tried a bite it tasted bland to me. The beef soup dumplings were good, it was my first time trying them I'd like to try more I was expecting a little bit different flavors but it was still good. The service was ok, the waitress did come over and boxed up our left over food when we were finished. Overall an good experience."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars?  I was hoping for really good dumpling here since it's called dumpling king but the XLB has a weird sour taste to it... Maybe that's the style? But didn't enjoy it and I've tried a lot of XLB elsewhere.  Beef noodle soup - nothing specially, edible, meh.  Cumin lamb - this was really good! Without this dish maybe I would've given it a 2 star.  We had left over for the first 2 dishes and it wasn't really worth bringing home."}
{"text":"The main entrées were tasty.  We tried a lamb dish, which was very good.  The duck was ok.  Nothing fancy, but just delicious because it's duck.  The dumpling wraps tasted homemade, but the dumpling fillings were just ok.  The taro dessert (which we were told was an entree) was probably the highlight of the meal.  Prices to me were higher than I'd like to pay, and the portions were ok except for the white rice.  They only filled the bowl half way, but charged $2.  For something so cheap I'm not sure why they would be stingy with rice portions.  Service was the typical lack luster for Chinese restaurants with delicious food.  Overall, I will not go back unless I have an undeniable craving to eat authentic Chinese food that's slightly over priced."}
{"text":"Very small dining area. This isn't Canoe. Just plastic tables and plastic chairs. But if you want some dumplings, cheap, fast, and hot, Dumpling King is your choice.  There are a few unfortunate and amusing English typos on the menu, like \"seefood\" and \"vegitanian\" but for $6 for a dozen dumplings, who cares?  I found it odd the meat dumplings were a $1 cheaper the \"vegitanian\" dumplings.   Me and my very very sexy date had the beef and carrot dumplings and the pork and napa dumplings. You get a choice how you want them done: steamed, boiled, or fried. We had them steamed. The pork were really good. The beef were a bit of a step down but still pretty good.  They do a brisk take out."}
{"text":"Had the lamb/carrot and pork/chive dumplings.     Very little meat in the dumpling, not much flavour and very thick nonchewy skin.  The tea is also flavourless and disappointing.  For some reason they don't have red vinegar either."}
{"text":"My friends and i were looking for a place to eat. We were only allowed to be in Chinatown for an hour cuz we took a tour bus. So we decided to get something cheap. Since we were in a hurry the waitress sure took her time. Ordering drinks was a process. The waitress was slow. Only ONE waitress! The food was slow. However the food was delicious.  I ordered pan fried dumplings and cold noodles...one of the few places I would go back again."}
{"text":"taste very good!! must try!! soooooooo good! traditional Chinese foods. those people who like Chinese foods must try!"}
{"text":"I came here on Christmas vacation. We ordered a bunch of dishes that I can't pronounce in Chinese . The dishes that stuck out to me were the stone dumplings, soup dumplings and the lamb! All were so delicious!! I can't believe that Vegas has such yummy Chinese food right next door to the strip! I definitely want to come here again and try everything else!   One word of advice for travelers, this restaurant is a ways from Las Vegas Blvd.. There are a lot of restaurants on the way to this one, don't be hindered! Just keep driving! This place was worth it :)"}
{"text":"I am loving everything on Spring Mtn road and this place is between a shopping center and car shop so be ready to turn in to its own lot. This is one of my mom's favorite place. Lots of red flowers and red colored seats, very unique dining decoration that she loves lol and what we had was the crystal dumpling.   Crystal dumpling (w meat) is from north China. XLB (Xiao long bao) is from Shanghai. These dumplings were like pan fried so they were gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside (my most fav texture ever) with juice! Like xlb it squirted across the table, which surprised me! So pretty too! They are encased with lattice (say it with French  accent) that tasted a little acidic and like those shrimp chips we all love growing up. Even my mom loved the lattice! (She pointed and laughed to a piece that sadly fell onto the table.) We must have something like this in the bay area??   One dish per person, or one for two people and get a veggie dish too. We wanted mung bean noodle, which is what my mom wanted to introduce me to also, but they said they were out of it! And must order in advance! Only two tables were occupied for lunch... Curious, but ok. Will do for next time. One star less for that inconvenience and for a waitress that stood so close to our table almost the entire time."}
{"text":"We got the pork soup dumplings, golden fried dumplings, pan fried bao, and the spicy noodles with green onions. So good. Everything was super fresh and delicious. Also, it's run by a very sweet family - our server was a total sweetheart. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"After hearing some glowing reviews from some Yelpers, Dumpling King was on the top of my list of places to try in Vegas!   I'll cut straight to the good stuff. I came here with 3 friends and we shared 4 dishes: beef soup dumplings, mapo tofu, fried green beans and the beef roll. With 3 other Chinese people at the table, we were in agreement. This was definitely the best Chinese food that we've had here in Vegas so far. Now, we are medical students after all. We don't go gallivanting around the high end Strip hotel Chinese restaurants so take that into consideration.   The beef soup dumplings were decent. I just wish they were a bit soupy-er. The bottom of the dumpling was so fragile that 8 out of 10 dumplings tore during transit to our mouths and the soup leaked out. I really enjoyed the mapo tofu and string beans. You can't get that kind of mapo tofu from the box mix they sell in stores!  All in all it was a good experience and I'm sure we will be back. The prices are a little higher than what I'm used to for Chinese food but we were substantially full by the end of the meal. I will definitely want to explore the rest of the menu since there were soooo many items on there!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations. The juicy beef dumplings were excellent and the hand pulled noodles were addicting. The eggplant potato dish and green onion pancakes were also delicious. Plus the server, whom I believe was the owner, was so kind, attentive and helpful. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wonderful dumplings!  Great service as well.  We had the soup and the stone dumplings."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! Every single time I go here I leave so happy haha. Had dumplings craving so my friend and I had to go here. We ordered the beef steamed dumplings, beef noodle soup and wanted to be adventurous and try the crisp pork stomach but they don't have it so it was beef brisket instead.  Beef steamed dumplings: the steamed dumpling has a thick moist layer of wrap, dip this baby into a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce and chili... Mouth watering explosion. 5/5  Beef wonton soup: Love the flavor of the broth, as well as the thick noodles and soft meat. 4/5  Beef Brisket: cuts of brisket with the fatty part attached, very moist and packed with flavor.. Stir fry with bell peppers and onion. Very good with rice! 5/5"}
{"text":"Interesting Fabrics for their furniture. Typical Chinese NorthEast style. Whatever we tried today are all good.  one dish is plenty enough for 4 people to share."}
{"text":"We were craving dumplings.  My friend was hungover, and I was just in the need for Asian food because I hadn't had it for a while (was in Europe for two weeks).  We ended up orderin deep fried pork + chives dumplings; steamed seafood dumplings, and celery salad side.  Each dumpling dish had 16 dumplings on it.  The celery side salad was great to offset the meat that you have with the dumplings.  In total, we paid less than $20 and were definitely really full."}
{"text":"Sixteen of us met for an Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE).  After pushing two large round tables together, we were seated in the side room.  Each table ordered its own things but with some advice from Philip T. whose review inspired the UYE.  Our table ordered:  Beef soup dumplings Crystal dumplings Crispy beef Beef patty Cumin lamb Beef fried rice Dim sum dumplings  The standout dish for me was the cumin beef.  Complex flavors with good spiciness but it could have been kicked up a notch or two.  The soup dumplings were also very good and the tip of using your chopsticks to coax the dumpling onto your spoon resulted in a filled dumpling with the soup inside.  The wrapper is very thin but it's so worth the effort to get the full dumpling with it's beef filling and beef soup on the inside.  I enjoyed the crispy beef.  The beef fried rice was good as were the dim sum dumplings.  The crystal dumplings fell a little short in flavor and the beef patty--the item I suggested--was my least favorite.  I thought the bread covering the beef was too thick and the ground beef was somewhat greasy.    As mentioned in some reviews, while they serve dumplings, there is much more on the menu than dumplings and when I go back it will be for one of those dishes than for the dumplings.  This is the kind of place you go with friends to share.  It's the only was to be able to try a number of items. Thanks to Stefany for putting the UYE together.  Good food, good Yelp company.  It doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"Cannot believe how people have been giving 4/5 stars to this sh*tty little place. My dining experience was horrible, consider that I've been there twice (Yeah that many till I learnt my lesson). I live nearby and it was pretty much the only Chinese restaurant (except for take-outs - which Wiki Star in the same building is SO MUCH MORE worth trying) in the area.  I went there both times for lunch - took me and my bf more than 20 minutes for just a plate of deep fried dumplings. Seriously? How long do you need to fry the pre-boiled dumplings? We didn't expect such a long time for lunch, and had plans afterwards, so we asked the cook (and the waiter, there was only one person there who did the cooking and the serving) to cancel the rest of the foods, he said NO because 'they were being prepared already'.. then we ask to take them to go, he said NO again claiming there was no take-out boxes - WHERE THE OTHER LADY AT THE OTHER TABLE CAME IN FOR TAKE-OUTS AND HE ALREADY GAVE IT TO HER!! IN THE FRIGGING TAKE-OUT BOXES!!!  Crappy food and even crappier service. If there was a negative star I would gave it 10-!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pan seared dumplings, steamed beef dumplings, beef egg and leak dumplings, beef soup dumplings and shrimp lo mein.   We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday and we were the only ones in the restaurant - not a good sign. I'm always on the search for a great dumpling and this sadly fell short in many ways. One of the biggest disappointments were the lack of pork in any dumpling, typically a staple ingredient. I'm unsure if this is for religious reasons, but there are NO pork dumplings (or pork in any dishes for that matter).  Pan seared dumplings - I believe these were beef. They appeared to be the same as the steamed beef dumplings, just prepared a different style. I prefer pan seared over steamed because there's typically a delicious aroma that comes from it, and I prefer the bottom of the skin to be crispy. These were not seared long enough in the pan, and the skin was mildly crispy at best.  Also, the skin was too thick. The flavor was okay, but I was definitely wishing I had the pork flavor.   Steamed beef dumplings - much like the pan seared. The skin was thick, I wasn't impressed.  Beef egg and leak dumpling - These were decent. Am I craving these and dying to come back? Definitely not. The skin was also too thick and again, NO PORK.   Beef soup dumplings - as I broke into these I was impressed with the massive juices oozing out. When I started chewing, I was disappointed with the lack of pork again and also the mushy texture that just wasn't quite right. The taste was not bad, but these are not the typical soup dumplings that I crave and am accustomed to.   Shrimp Lo Mein - these were fine. A little on the greasy side. The flavor was good.   All in all, I have no desire to come back. Even with a dumpling craving, I just don't think these would satisfy me. Was it terrible? No, just not my preference. Also, bathroom hallway was not lit and extremely confusing as I couldn't see a single thing trying to find it. The waitress could not speak ANY English. Thankfully I was with someone that spoke mandarin. Maybe it was the time I went, but I just walked away unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Its TST - Two Star Tuesday again!!!  I saw my yf Philip T's review, and I said I have to hit this dumpling place the next time I am in the Ninth Island.  However, I wish I didn't.  Dumpling King is on Spring Mountain Road, 2 miles west of the 15 in Vegas.  Spring Mountain is a mecca for good Azn food in the area.  Five of us ordered the baked yolk coated pumpkin ($9.99), salt & pepper squid ($14.99), braised eggplant ($8.99), shrimp fried rice ($8.95), green onion pancake ($6.99 x 2), juicy beef soup dumplings ($9.99 x 2), and shrimp, egg & leek dumplings ($8.99 x 2).    First of all, the pumpkin was very unique.  It had the texture of potatoes that had been baked, but tasted like they were fried.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't order this dish again:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the squid didn't taste like the salt & pepper versions I have had anywhere else.  Additionally, it was overpriced:  2 Stars.  In contrast to the first two dishes, the eggplant was very good.  It wasn't overcooked or drowned in oil like many places:  4 Stars.   Fourthly, the shrimp fried rice was dry, and didn't have much shrimp or flavor.  Luckily, it didn't cost much:  2 Stars.  Fifthly, the pancake was pretty bad.  It had too much batter, although the portion was large.  It was a poor representation of a basic dish:  2 Stars.  Contrasting the previous two bad dishes, the signature beef soup dumplings were excellent as advertised.  The dumplings were super moist, and the soup was really flavorful.  Think Mama Lu's XLBs (Monterey Park, CA), w/o the tins:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the shrimp dumplings were just OK.  They really did not have a special taste:  3 Stars.  Regarding the ambiance, it was odd to say the very least.  The chairs were decorated in a bright, reddish flower motif, and there were Christmas decorations present:  Garland, poinsettia looking things and a door w/ a cover saying \"Merry Christmas\".  However, it was not garish:  3 Stars.  On the other hand the service was terrible.  We were not offered tea, and had to ask for more water & napkins.  However, when we asked the helper w/ the cross earring for the latter two items, he only brought napkins.  The nice lady (prolly an owner), who took our order couldn't make up for the $hitty service:  1 Star.  Lastly, the kitchen was rated 1 Star because the order the dishes arrived.  The rice arrived first, and the dumplings did not arrive together.  The order made no sense at all.  Sorry, Philip.  But DK was a big disappointment except for the soup dumplings.  The service was fukn horrible.  There is NFW I would return here!"}
{"text":"This is hard to write and explain about this place. It's one thing to have amazing service, kind staff, yet the food, well the food was tasteless, or maybe bland, and I regret eating any of it. The food had no flavor, it was served in stages, and there was so much food as we ordered several dishes without knowing how much came on a plate with each serving, I was full before everything came to the table.   How can there be a restaurant that serves food with no taste. The meat was almost mystery meat, and I actually had to stop, dig into what was on my plate to see if any of it was recognizable.   Again, staff was awesome, he had a huge smile on his face, was attentive, and was very kind. Just a bit lost for words about the actual meal. I know they just took over the restaurant and maybe things will change, but I'm left completely unsatisfied. So sorry to say it. Maybe I'm just missing something."}
{"text":"Delicious food, tremendous service, super clean restaurant. In Chinatown, it's now our go-to on an even par with China Mama. This Northern Chinese restaurant is a first for Vegas' Chinatown (that we are aware of at least) and it's a winner!  Last night we had: cumin lamb, raw potato (silk removed vinegar), dry fried string beans, teppanyaki stuffed eggplant, cold cucumber salad, soup dumplings, stone dumplings (lamb), leek dumplings and we waddled out happily with leftovers for days and new friends. Everything was interesting, flavorful, and memorable. I actually thought about getting up in the night for another bite but behaved myself.  Dumplings for breakfast for the win!"}
{"text":"New dumpling resturant, not sure if anyone else can recommend other dumpling resturants but this is very delicious.   I brought my friends from LA here and they enjoyed it too!  The decorations are red and flowers as seen in pictures. They have private rooms: party size and large.  Must order: lamb dumplings!! You can't go wrong with it!  Parking is a bit limited but there is some in the back.  Local mom and pop resturant! I support local restaurants!"}
{"text":"I came here for take out recently and upon entering the restaurant my eyes burst from the bright floral patterned seat covers. They were a bit of an eyesore. As for the rest of the restaurant, it was cutely arranged with round tables and red Chinese lanterns lining the ceilings. They were playing old school Christmas songs which got me in a cheery mood whilst waiting.  I ordered the soup dumplings and the fried string beans. I was hoping for them to be big portions for the amount I paid, which was $20 for two dishes.   So the verdict:  The dumplings were ok and hardened as soon as they started to cool down. The green beans were seasoned nicely and was a good portion but the down side was how greasy they were.   I'm willing to give this place another shot I didn't really love what I had."}
{"text":"Next stop on my soup dumpling journey: Dumpling King Lots of mixed reviews, but I came here determined to see for myself. I was very pleased!  Once I walked in, I was bombarded by the sight of super bright red floral chairs. There was only one other table there, so I was immediately greeted and seated at a table.  It seems like the smallest tables they have are 4 tops, which isn't bad, but sitting there on my own almost tempted me to order enough food to fill up all the space :P   After my eyes recovered from the chair assault, I took a glance at the menu to find the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings. It took a few minutes since the layout is a bit weird. Protip - the menu items skip numbers because the pictured items are removed from the list.   Anyway, the soup dumplings were so good! I've seen some reviews saying some or all dumplings came broken, but I guess I was lucky, as all of mine were intact! Filling as well as broth were flavorful (nice amount of ginger). My new go to place for these!  I ordered some green onion pancake too, just so the dumplings weren't lonely. Standard, good with soy sauce and chili oil/paste.  Food came with a complementary pot of tea.   Woohoo! So far so good on my soup dumpling hunt. I'm eager to see if I can find better here in Vegas, but I'll be happy to come back here until that happens.  I've read this place is almost as good as Din Tai Fung, which was highly recommended to me. I feel like there's a trip to L.A. for new in the near future : )"}
{"text":"Five star dumpling place in town! Friendly service. Tasty food. Reasonable price. It would not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. Low key casual restaurant with great authentic foods! New ownership, a must try."}
{"text":"Review based on delivery from just-eat. 3.5 stars  Ordered the beef radish, sauerkraut pork, and seafood. Order came on time as promised and were given condiment packages (vinegar, soy, and chili oil - key to proper dumpling eating). The sauerkraut pork one had the best filling. Don't worry, it is not actually sauerkraut, but actually is just chinese fermented napa cabbage, kind of like white kimchi. The dough they use for boiled/steamed dumpling was not the best as it got mushy and stuck together during the delivery process. This was never a issue when I got delivery from yummy yummy.  The seafood one which I ordered pan fried was not excecuted very well. The frying was not on point leaving a less than satisfactory crust. There was also not a lot of filling.  Not the best but decent dumpling - no MSG and tasted fresh. Good for when yummy yummy is closed."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 2/5  The soup dumplings were \"okay\". It was not as steamy, moist and flavorful as other's I've had (especially in San Francisco). Service was slow and the decor was very blahh.  Other dishes were avg. as well."}
{"text":"I had a 10PM dumpling craving last night and went to Yelp to find me a place to go. I figured a place called Dumpling King would be the best place for said craving. The restaurant is brightly decorated- lots of red, lanterns and flowers. They have a good number of tables with a room in the back for bigger parties. We did not wait more than 15 minutes for our food- the dumplings took a little longer than the rest of our order. Being the fatties with no patience that we are, the fried rice was gone by the time the dumplings came out. So sad!  Steamed beef dumplings: Pretty disappointing for a restaurant named after them. The dumplings did not give me the juicy flavorful experience that I expected when I bit into them.  Shrimp fried rice: If I had closed my eyes and taken a bite, I may have thought I was eating just plain white rice with carrots and peas. Give me that MSG I want my Chinese food to have more flavor. The shrimp was even more bland than the rice.  Both were $9, portion wise not enough for 2 people. We should have ordered more."}
{"text":"The soup dumpling is delicious, cumin beef, and the string beans are delicious! Will try their hot pots next time...looked delicious from the table next to us."}
{"text":"Best Xiaolongbao in Las Vegas! Very fresh and hot. Made in front of you,  not frozen."}
{"text":"Food is great, but service could be better.  The waitress is a bit slow. I approached her about something, after waiting forever and when I remind her about it, she totally forgot and seem like never had heard of the request!! I asked about a dish that I thought I ordered, and she said \"its on its way\", then later after waiting for another 30min, she said she would check on it and find out I actually never ordered it!!  Anyways, I really like the shumai and the cystal dumplings.   I really want to try the \"squirrel whole fish\", but they dont stock the whole fish. Owner was kind enough to give me their card, told me next time before I come to call and she would shop for fresh fish...."}
{"text":"Went here last night on a whim. We ordered from the \"must try section\". Got to say that when its hot it's pretty good, nothing to rave about. Little pricey. But when the food becomes cold it really gets soggy and oily. The best was the pan fried potstickers for $9.99. Good and best value I think."}
{"text":"A friend from out of town was telling me about all the great dumpling places that he has been going to lately. I got excited and found this place. Wife and I were really in the mood for dumplings. We were hoping this place was going to be really good. It was mediocre. Nobody was there when we arrived at 6 pm on Saturday. Not a good sign, but by the time we left the place was full. Got lucky, I guess. We read yelp reviews before going. Decorations were as hideous as described. The boy working there was not very good, but he was polite. Obviously a family business. We ordered simmering beef noodle soup, steamed beef soup dumplings, and pan fried crystal beef dumplings. The soup was pretty good. The noodles seemed fresh made. However, the dumplings were nothing special. The steamed dumplings were over salted and fell apart too easily. The crystal dumplings reminded me of frozen. Most of the menu was not dumplings. Seems like this place is a Chinese restaurant with dumplings on the menu, not a place that specialized in dumplings. I would go back if someone suggested it, but I would not pick it."}
{"text":"First time to this spot...figured I would try some dumplings out...  Decor was as expected...felt like I got slapped by a huge Chinese floral pattern upon entering...  Ordered the beef stew noodle (not too bad...China Mama is better)...  Since this is the dumpling king...you would figure their dumplings would be amaze-balls but wrong! Mediocre at best...and I've had plenty of dumplings to compare this to...ordered the shrimp chive ones (blah)...  Overall, worth the try not definitely not worth coming to again...perhaps if they make better dumplings!!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Dumplings, Dumplings, Dumplings.  Unfortunately I can't review too much else because all I have there is Dumplings.  Very authentic and always wall to wall \"nationals\", sometimes you even have trouble ordering if you do not know mandarin.  Food is great, they have every dumpling you can think of, my personal favorite is the \"stone pan dumplings\".  Its a bit away from the strip, but worth the drive for sure! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's nothing special. I need more than this. The dumplings are big though. I especially miss my nonna's homemade ones. Ohhhh"}
{"text":"My first impression is the decor of the restaurant with its red floral chairs is an acquired taste.  Service is slow so if you are in a rush this is not the place to go.  I had the pan fried dumplings and the beef noodle soup.  The food is okay and it's nothing I would write more about."}
{"text":"Review strongly based on SERVICE, from one time only. Upon walking in, we were seated immediately (cool). As we sat down, our waitress tended to the table next to us quickly after seating us before asking us for a drink order. Eventually... we got our water and hot tea. When I asked what was their specialties or famous plates, our waitress had some difficulty with communicating. Limited English, totally fine! However, my waitress informed my mom and I that they ONLY had beef dumplings available. A party that entered after us immediately received water and hot tea. We opted for the \"ONLY\" beef dumplings available, hot and sour soup, and another protein dish. Our dumplings were served on a cold white plate, as all the other tables around us were served in the typical steam container. Odd, right? After waiting for 20mins for some damn hot & sour soup (it wasn't very busy), we decided to pay and leave after only eating 7 sadly served dumplings.   After speaking to the manager (owner?) - she was nice and cordial - and had gladly informed me they had several other options in dumplings. Umm what? She went on, \"the beef dumplings was probably the only quick serve dumpling readily made. All the other ones need to be made and might have taken a while.\"   Bottomline, I was provided sorry excuses for the nonavailability of food. It didn't make sense that the party after us were served dumplings in the proper tray, as well as the following parties after them (2 groups).   It's hard to really comment on the taste of the dumplings when the service effects your entire experience. My parents have had been in culinary for 25+ years, and know when the service is sketchy or explainable for busy-ness or hassle-ness.   To end this review, the manager told me its best to come after the holiday so that I get better service. Oh, that's great to know."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to finally check this place out this weekend after being it being on my Yelp bookmarks for awhile. I was certainly not disappointed!  We shared the beef soup dumplings and beef dim sum dumplings. Both were great but I personally liked the dim sum better. They came in better big portions too, about ten each. The total for our whole meal was under $30 which I think was a steal.  I also loved that the hot tea was complementary. Very good service and overall a great place. I'll be back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  If you're just visiting Vegas and you're looking for some authentic northeastern Chinese food, this is definitely a place worth checking out. It's still relatively new but the food tasted amazing and authentic.  Also the staff was very friendly.  We ordered beef dumplings and they even hand-made the Chinese yellow wasabi at our request.  Definitely coming back here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came here to get my fix for the kind of food I have grown accustomed to. I had never seen lamb dumplings before, but I have now and they are good. Also had the Lamb with cumin. Both of these I would order again in a minute. Overall I would say they do lamb well. I did not see any pork dishes, not sure what is going on there with that. Try this place you will like it. It was almost empty when I came here."}
{"text":"We were warmly greeted and seated by the server. I was asking for recommendations but the server couldn't understand English.  She called in the owner who could speak English but was not too helpful with recommending anything good... Maybe because she was busy having dinner herself. I asked for hot tea and was given a pot of hot water.  The juicy beef soup dumpling was really good. The steamed duck was a little tough & dry though.  Our bill came up to $30 & we left feeling hungry still."}
{"text":"The greatest chinese food i've ever eaten. Awesome spice that i've never had in chinese food and dumplings that actually taste really good, that's a first."}
{"text":"Their name does not do the place justice! They specialize in Northern Chinese cuisine rather than just dumplings. I was really excited to discover that we have a Northern Chinese restaurant and I'm even happier now that it's so good - I'm already planning my second visit!  Fried Lamb w/ Cumin ($14.99): Thinly-sliced lamb fried (no batter), then stir-fried with onions, cilantro, cumin seeds, and other spices. Delicious!! Fantastic flavor. I love cumin and when I first discovered that Northern Chinese cuisine utilized cumin, I was rather excited. Fabulous by itself and great with rice. Highly recommended.  Teppan Tofu ($9.99): Fried soft tofu cooked in a delicious dark sauce with minced beef and vegetables. It's served on a hot plate and stays hot throughout your meal. This was surprisingly one of the stand-out dishes! Really great flavor and the tofu was super silky. You want to eat this with rice, too.  Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings ($9.99): The serving is generous with ten large dumplings. The skin is nice and chewy with lots of soup in each dumpling. It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it's good with their chili and soy sauces available on the table. FYI: I'm not crazy about soup dumplings in general.  Shrimp Fried Noodles ($8.99): Hand-pulled noodles!! That excited me enough, but even better, they were DELICIOUS! The noodles were chewy and cooked perfectly al dente. The dish preparation was great, too. I'm definitely in noodle love. I'd eat these noodles every day, every way.  Beef Patty ($6.99): This is a deceiving name, but I honestly can't think of an English equivalent that wouldn't be equally confusing. It's called Rou Jia Mo and is more commonly described as a sandwich or burger, but not like the ones we're accustomed. The bun is a type of flatbread that is pan-fried, then filled with meat (typically stewed for hours). It actually reminds me of an arepa. It's delicious! I love the bun. I only wish they had additional filling options on the menu - the cumin lamb would be amazing!  Steamed Lamb Dumplings ($9.99): Another generous ten large dumplings filled with meat. This one had a bit of \"soup\" in them as well which was nice. Nice skin like the soup dumplings and you could really taste the lamb. Again, pretty plain in the flavor department though. Not sure I'm that crazy about their dumplings, but then again, boiled or steamed dumplings are a tough sell for me. I did like their dumpling skins.  We received one pot of rice with our dishes. I requested an additional one and we weren't informed of the extra charge ($2). Our server was very kind and pleasant, but absent during our meal. That meant no drink refills. We were finally able to get her attention after we were done for to-go containers and water.  Also, it's a Muslim restaurant, so there is NO pork on the menu. But you won't miss it with all the beef, lamb, seafood, and other meats available. There are also lots of vegetable dishes. Anyway, there are so many ill-described items on the menu with no photos (if you can't read Chinese), but I'm excited to explore them!"}
{"text":"The place is clean for now. Asian restaurants always scare me in that respect. The decor is super tacky but the owner is proud of it. These are simple people. The husband cooks while the son and mom serve. You can tell the son and mom are not professional servers but they are nice and friendly. The food is northern Chinese which focuses on dough products like noodles and dumplings. They also don't serve pork. Everything is flavorful and it was a nice change from the Cantonese Chinese restaurants. If you don't know Northern Chinese food, you might be in for a shock. The place was very good for down home northern Chinese cooking, but not for everyone. It's not your typical Chinese restaurant food, so if you don't know it, you probably won't like it. It's more like Chinese country comfort food.  We didn't get to try the soup dumplings until recently. They are not very good. Bund Shanghai and 1900 have better soup dumplings for sure."}
{"text":"I dont always give reviews. When I do, either a very good restaurant or a bad one.  To be honest, this restaurant is the best one I had in Vegas. Best Traditional northern Chinese cuisine in Vegas, tasty dumplings with decent price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place really surprised me on how good the food is. The dumpling are freshly made, and they even have their own specialty chef that make some of the dumplings. The owner is very nice and kind. The place is very clean and tidy. Don't forget to try the stone dumpling and the Shao Mai."}
{"text":"Best tasting dumpling I have had in toronto. Love the steamed option.  The wait can be a bit long as the place is tiny and u may come out smell like dumpling urself."}
{"text":"You will not find pork here.    This is a real Chinese Muslim restaurant.    Dumplings are amazing.   Service is above Chinese typical.    First time Here? They will help you.    Xian Manchurian food.       My mom loves this place.  1.   Chinese ludafisk and persevere cabbage soup.    2.   Lamb stir fry.    3. Cold noodle salad.   4.   Shrimp chive beef dumpling.    All 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dumplings shop. While I did see that they make their dough themselves in-house, the meat fillings weren't good, dough wasn't cooked well at the top where you pinch to close the dumpling. Tried steamed beef, shrimp and leek (didn't see any shrimp at all), fried beef dumplings (potsticker), beef soup dumplings. All were just below average if compared to dumplings at Lao Wang in Denver."}
{"text":"This place was good but i think I've been spoiled by Los Angeles. It doesn't compare to din tai Fung or mama lus.   I absolutely love Shanghai dumplings but this place makes it with beef. I've never had beef dumplings before. They come in a order of ten I think for 10 bucks.. That's double the price of mama lus. The size of the dumplings were small. And all of us broke the thin skin and lost the juice. The trick is to pick it up with your fingers at the nipple of the dumplings ( I don't know how else to describe it lol). I also wished they served the dumplings with ginger.   Other than that the beef burritos were really good... And the spicy fish was really good. Lots and lots of oil and bean sprouts but the fish was silky and flavorful.   I didn't like their green onion pancake because it was so thick and chewy. It was not flaky or crispy at all.  The lady also served us leek dumplings... Which no one ordered but she insisted that we did. Maybe we did?  I'll try other places first before coming back here again."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a 0 I would. My husband and I came here for dinner, had us wait 30 minutes while there are 5 open tables and then finally sat us at a table that was open for 30 minutes. It took 15 minutes to put our order in and then we waited 45 minutes until we asked about our food. They checked on our food only to tell us they were sold out of soup dumplings. Mind you, we only ordered soup dumplings and crystal dumplings. That's it. It wasn't a drastic order. So after wasting our damn time they told us the crystal dumplings will be out in 5 minutes but we ended up waiting for 20 minutes. Horrible service. Don't let us sit here for over 45 minutes just to tell us you are sold out of soup dumplings. Horrible horrible service. Also, a party of 4 was seated 30 minutes after us got their food WAY before us. This place seems racist and seems to favoritize customers of Chinese descent."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and way better than expected, but they ran out of dumplings. I highly recommend the fried noodles."}
{"text":"Great dumplings! I went by this place after it was newly opened and I have to say that I was very ahppy with their product. The restaurant is sparsely filled with furniture and decor but as I was getting take out that didn't matter. I took their vegetarian selection of dumplings and was happy with their size, price and taste. I have gone back and will continue to!"}
{"text":"Dumplings are tasty and reliable every time we visit. Chef has a way with tofu which needs to experience first hand dine-in. Take out won't do justice to the chef. Wanted to order fish, but they don't have fresh fish so they apologized. Every time we visit they are not very busy. The restaurant is kind of big. I hope they do well enough to stay open, as I really enjoy their food"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all.  I came here when it first opened and ordered the beef soup, stone dumplings and xiao long bao.  Everything that we ordered was just ok definitely not blow you away delicious.  We attributed the mediocrity to the restaurant just opening - maybe they just needed more time to iron out the kinks. We returned today to retry everything hoping that since they had been opened for a while the dumplings would be better.  Nope still mediocre.  The beef noodle soup was bland.  There are so many restaurants that offer a better bowl of noodles. Save your time and tummy for something better."}
{"text":"Great place for Authentic Chinese food! If you're visiting,you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Tea Vinegar Slips Away Potato Silk Fried Lamb with Cumin Crystal Beef Grilled Dumplings Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings Lamb Boiled Dumplings Boiled Shrimp Egg and Leek Dumplings Baked Yolk Coated Pumpkin Steamed Venison Dumplings Spicy Laoganma Sauced Eggplant Leek Pancake Roasted Peking Duck Toffee Taro  Largely unaware of the prevalence of the Muslim religion in China, let alone its particular contributions to the country's culinary diversity, it was with great curiosity that five friends and I sat down amidst the colorful confines of Dumpling King and with friendly service paired to one of the most cleanly spaces on Spring Mountain Road the dozen plates that followed were every bit as surprising as the relative lack of praise the space has received since opening its doors nearly one year ago.  Truly a decorative space, with red florals covering each seat and several shining ornaments arranged in the foyer as well as alongside the bar, it was at one of the large turnstile tables that the group was sat and with full view afforded of each dumpling being made by hand suffice it to say that the surprisingly low priced menu is an even bigger bargain when taking into account the painstaking effort involved in each piece, a single order of ten broth-soaked beef soup dumplings taking the team of three nearly five minutes to mix, roll out, fill, and twist fourteen times before arranging to steam.  Treated to tea, as well as water that unfortunately required frequent prompting to be refilled, it was in a pair of items considered to be Northern Chinese specialties that the tasting began and with tender potatoes sliced like noodles beneath a drizzle of vinegar presented alongside richly spiced lamb mixed with shoots, onions, and peppers the opening volley traversed the palate adeptly, the light heat of dried peppers occasionally peaking through with a touch of unexpected sweetness lingering on the end.  Moving onward to the dumplings it was largely at the discretion of our server that the table placed its faith, and opting to see what could be done in a variety of fillings and styles one would be hard pressed to say which presentation was 'best' as not a single one lacked - the steamed beef \"XLB\" more meaty than most with an intensely flavorful broth while both the 'stone dumplings' amidst their golden lattice and the rich venison variant were chockablock full of flavor, the later almost as juicy as the soup dumplings with more than enough aromatic nuance to help even the most timid palates conquer their fear of game.  Personally impressed by the soft pumpkin fried beneath salty egg yolk, while others felt the flavors too mundane, it was again a 'vegetarian special' that wowed in the next round of plates and although the robust heat was an early challenge to my somewhat timid tongue subsequent bites of the Laoganma eggplant proved more and more accessible, a mild numbing effect perhaps contributing to somewhat off-putting 'oily' flavor prevalent in sizzling leek pancakes that were otherwise lightly fried and creamy beneath the exterior crunch.  Admittedly taking a chance on Peking Duck, considering the heritage of the space in which we dined, suffice it to say that neither tepid flesh nor flaccid skin was well received yet with eyes at this point glazing over from the sheer volume of delicious food it was the final plate of the afternoon that proved the most interesting of all; a pile of chopped taro boiled soft beneath a shattering lacquer of caramelized sugar that necessitated a quick bath in iced water in order to avoid severe burns, each cube harkening a creamy one-bite crème brûlée.  Undoubtedly unique, not only in its heritage but also with regard to the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, Dumpling King is perhaps the very definition of 'hidden gem,' the dumplings themselves undoubtedly on par with the best in the city while other unique plates such as the potatoes, eggplant, pumpkin, and taro are the sort of things I've not seen since trips to Toronto and Richmond, BC."}
{"text":"What you see on the big poster outside the store is exactly what you'll get on your plate.  One order is fifteen of the same pieces of white, unattractive dumplings; served on a white plate.  What is called deep fried dumpling is like a doughnut/samosa (not like a fried gyoza).  That being said, they taste pretty good!  Although I wont likely go back, this was for me better than Rol San or Dumpling House!  Service was okay but not on the fast side."}
{"text":"Eating here now and the seafood dumplings are fantastic! Have also had the pork and leek as well as beef and onion. All good, but seafood my fave. Hot and fresh! Love this little itty bitty Dumpling shop. It does take some time, which is why I always order in advance. Always satisfies my Dumpling craving!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but nothing too special.  Food: + Juicy Pork Dumplings: 10 pieces for $10. The over all taste was delicious, but it was a little disappointing because there was little to no soup in the dumpling itself :( I've been spoiled by eating the best in California, but this place isn't too shabby. Not the worst, not the best.  + Crystal Beef Grilled Dumplings:  10 pieces for $10. This is basically pan fried dumplings. Presentation was interesting to say the least. The taste was alright; I wish the bottoms were fried a little bit more so it would give it a night crispy crunch.   Being called \"Dumpling King\" I assumed their dumplings would be the best/only item on their menu, but theres actually a lot of variety on their menu of other Chinese food. I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their other food as well.   Environment: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out noodles I have ever had.  Fresh, fast, great staff.  Spotlessly clean restaurant.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally a northern chinese food place in vegas, i been looking for one forever. The owner are super friendly, the food are good if you enjoy traditional northern chinese food."}
{"text":"Dumplings are a must try, the noodles ended up being a little uninteresting and it was served lukewarm. It could be because I went 30 mins before closing, but the noodles were fresh and chewy and the dumplings were definitely made fresh and on house. Will be back, but it's a little pricey"}
{"text":"Came here for the soup dumplings which I have never had anywhere but I've heard so many reviews about it and I was excited to try it. So I got the soup dumplings and a couple other dishes. The service was good and the server recommended a variety of dishes definitely will come back.   The dumplings: really delicious and such a different kind of food item. The broth was flavorful and the meat inside was juicy and seasoned perfectly.   Lamb cumin dish: it was ok but I'm not a fan of any lamb because of that weird after taste.   Braised eggplant: I love eggplant and this was  exceptional. Very tender and covered in a sauce with a hint of a little sweetness.   Taro dish with the sugar in top: get this dish! Save this for dessert. It's fried taro fried with some sort of sugar mixture creating kinda a caramlized coating on top. Topped with sugar strings kinda like cotton candy. First bite you get the crunch of that coating and the softness of the taro inside and then you get the sugary strings that taste like ginger."}
{"text":"I \"seefood\" I eat food! I \"see\" dumplings.. I will eat them all!   I was a little embarrassed when I saw the spelling mistakes and the typos Dumpling King's menu on the wall..   Dumpling King is a small restaurant.. you cannot even see through the windows and doors on this particular winter night because of all the steams from cooking?   Dumplings here can be order either boiled, steamed or fried. I will definitely suggest the steamed. I like that better because all the juice from the meat are still packed inside and soup just explored in your mouth!! Be careful though, they are just really hot and fresh!   The owner/cook came out from the kitchen and served all his dumplings..and I can tell he is watching all of us eat and he definitely so happy when every single customers enjoyed his cooking!!   The dumplings are smaller in size than some of the other places I have been.. but $6 for 16.. I counted them.. are still good value."}
{"text":"Note to self: don't eat here alone.    What I thought would be a leisurely solo lunch turned into an unintentional pig out.  The plan was to simply have the juicy beef soup dumplings and then be on my merry way.  But when I opened the menu, it was as if I was wearing 3D glasses because letters and pictures were popping off the page and smacking me in the face.   Venison?  Fried lamb? Braised whole fish?  How soon can friends meet me so I can try more stuff??   I tried to stay calm and relaxed as the nice lady came over to take my order.  My thinking was that I would come back another time with a group to try more, but then I opened my stupid fucking mouth.  \"Soup dumplings, steamed lamb dumplings and vegetable noodles, please.\"   It was embarrassing when it all came out.  At that moment, I wished they offered study cubicle seating so people couldn't see what was in front of me.  Couldn't I just be a pig in private?  Why am I spending more than $30 on lunch today?  Customers just entering must have thought I was being rude by eating before my friends came back from the restroom.  No friends.  No sharing.  All mine.    I even thought there would be a chance of a group outside that would strip me of my clothes upon exit and march me down Spring Mountain repeatedly saying \"Shame. Shame.\" as a little bell rang and angry people threw shit at me.  It was official! Dumpling King made me go insane.      This order would also be an effective remedy for people suffering from insomnia.  I was fast asleep in an hour!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were excited to see a dumpling restaurant open in the area! I'm in love with soup dumplings. And China Mama down the street does a pretty good job of it. It's no 626, but its still good.  They have their own parking lot. Plus!   But first impression is.. the place smells. It's a very pungent bathroom odor. I wouldn't mind if it smelled like cleaning supplies.. but a smelly bathroom/sewage scent is NOT the way to go when you're eating! But it's an asian restaurant. Things like this slip through the cracks all the time. We stayed. We eventually got used to it.  The menu has a lot of items! Most of the English descriptions are pretty vague. So the pictures help a lot. We got lost in all of the choices and took awhile to order.  When we did, we ordered the pan fried beef patties, the soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup.   The patties were good. Crispy, flavorful, and tasted great with a little bit of vinegar and hot sauce.  The hot and sour soup was not as savory as other places I've had, but it was tasty as well. Full of flavor, jusy enough sour.   The soup dumplings normally take longer and were the last to arrive at the table. Tip: normally if you know you're ordering this dish, you should put in the order first. The dumplings were good. As a personal preference, I like my dumplings more sweet than salty, but here they make it salty. Also, there is actually not that much soup in each one.   The menu had other delicious sounding items so we'll probably be back to try other items. But they need to fix that smell!!  Overall.. 626 dumplings beats NY dumplings beats China Mama beats Dumpling King"}
{"text":"Food was decent and we have no complaints about what we were served.  This is a Muslim owned business so there is no pork on the menu which was somewhat limiting for a place with dumpling in the name of the place.  The decor is a bit off-putting but it was clean."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed by my last visit to Dumpling King.  Food has generally gone downhill.   The table arrangement has changed. There are now only 2 tables + a long bar to sit and eat at.  SALADS Cucumber salad was mediocre. Not very flavourful.  Wouldn't get this again. Seaweed or kelp salad was better.  I'd get again only if I was craving seaweed.  DUMPLINGS Dumplings are not as good as they used to be.  They're now smaller & shaped/sized like regular dumplings you could get anywhere. (They used to be a squatter shape. Also, Dumpling King used to have wonderful crispy deep-fried dumplings.)    We had the following types of dumplings: - chive & egg steamed - seafood boiled - pork & chive pan-fried - seafood pan-fried  THE FILLING Each of the fillings we had were tasty.  The chive & egg filling was very nice. We also enjoyed the seafood mixture.  The pork & chive is a classic choice and they did it fine.  THE WRAPPING Pan-fried dumplings (potstickers) were very badly constructed. The skins/wrappers were left completely open so no juices could be trapped inside the dumpling. To be clear, there was zero attempt to seal up the dumpling. The wrapper was just pressed together at one connection point like a gaping bathrobe. We actually asked (on our second round of orders) if they could use the regular closed dumplings and pan-fry those for us. The response was \"no\".  The skin of the steamed egg & chive dumplings was the wrong texture.  The skin was too thick and coarse and chewy. The skin seemed undercooked, probably because they're so thick. It had a dry, mealy texture which did not go well with the egg & chive filling at all.  Boiled dumpling skin was fine, nothing exceptional nor horrible.  THE COOK Pan-fried dumplings were only browned on one side. The sear on that one side was good, but it would have been nice if they had cooked other surfaces too. All the dumplings in the order were attached, which is non-ideal.   Steamed dumpling texture was coarse, dry, mealy and not good. These were not steamed well.  Boiled dumplings were cooked fine.  SERVICE Service is mediocre. It was fine at doing the minimum (taking orders & bringing food), but not particularly helpful or pleasant.   There was annoying music playing rather loudly.  Although the food quality has worsened and the service isn't great, Dumpling King still serves dumplings with some less typical fillings which are fairly tasty.  I'm not sure where else to go for egg & chive dumplings. Next time, I'd probably stay away from the potsticker style (pan-fried) and steamed dumplings and just go for the hard-to-mess-up boiled dumplings instead."}
{"text":"Walked in during closing time like around 10:40 but they closed at 10. The lady was very kindly to still serve us after hours. I felt bad for not knowing and stayed to eat Becuase apparently it said on Yelp they close at 12. Anyways the service is alright but the food is alright. I ordered the beef soup dumpling which everyone keeps talking about isn't all that. Also ordered the crispy beef and shrimp fried rice which was tasty but you can taste the MSG pretty heavy. I wish I can give this place more stars it's just instead of the lady just telling us we are closed instead of rushing us to order.....like okay?"}
{"text":"Damn great dumpling place.  Just like homemade.  Comes in 15s I think, and is surprisingly filling.  Get them steamed lets u eat more"}
{"text":"You know I had to go get XLB while on vacation.    Unfortunately, these XLB were just ok. The problem with them? A) they're beef.... it's all about the pork B) the skin was too fragile causing them to break every time when picking them up thus losing the juice thus making them regular dumplings... sad day.    Anyway, it wasn't bad in flavor and the décor in there is one of the best things I have seen in vegas ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago craving dumplings. The waiter (older lady) was more interested in talking to a visitor, than checking in on us. We actually had a pleasant man come by to help us with the non existent service.   The young man told us that this restaurant specialized in \"Northern Chinese food\" and recommended his favorite dish. We love to try new things, so we passed on the dumplings and received a dish that consisted of literally only fish, oil, and red peppers.  I was pretty disappointed that I wasted my weekly \"cheat meal\" on such a bland, unhealthy dinner. By this point we were completely abandoned by our original waiter, after talking to our \"shoe in\" waiter we found out he didn't even work at the restaurant, he was just a close family friend.  Too many bad signs to even consider coming back."}
{"text":"I was craving soup dumplings & decided to leave it up to yelp to figure out where I'd go.  I found this place & decided to give it a shot.  Let me start off by saying, I've eaten soup dumplings plenty of times; the soup dumplings here were mediocre at best.  Six came in one order, three were broken so they were sans soup (boooooooo).  My boyfriend thought they were incredible (he's also never had soup dumplings before).  We ordered the fried noodles with beef as well.  It was okay, I was starving so we pretty much polished the plate.  I could taste something was lacking, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  We also had the pan fried dumplings.  Those were horrible.  The filling was the size half my pinky, and it looked more like a cannelloni than a dumpling as they were open at both ends and just pinched in the middle.  Again, I was starving so we ate it.  I'd say it was pretty pricey for the mediocre food we got.  Most likely will not be returning, sorry dumpling king, you are definitely not the king!"}
{"text":"As an fyi, there is no pork on this menu.  Once we got past that, we ordered the soup dumpling that were beef instead of the traditional pork.  Surprising flavor, very good.  We had the shrimp dumpling which we both thought had too much egg and onion and very little shrimp.  The beef patty was very tasty but a little greasy.  Very few dumpling choices considering the name."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was definitely fond of the cumin lamb dish, but was disappointed with the juicy beef dumplings, as the skin was too thick for my taste.   I came back for a UYE event, and got to try a ton other dishes, and it was nice to be able to try a variety.   Cumin Lamb- 5 stars  (As good as I remembered)   Juicy beef dumplings- 4 stars.  This time, the skin was too thin? The skin broke and all the juices poured out if you tried picking it up with a chopstick. The trick was to scoop it into the spoon immediately from the plate.   Crystal dumplings- 2 stars. It looked cool, but the flavor was lacking.   Crispy beef- 2 stars. I liked the crisp, but the flavor was a bit odd. It tasted salty, and I wasn't able to place my finger on any other flavors.   Beef fried rice- 5 stars. Surprisingly, this dish was very good. I had low expectations, but it was nicely flavored.   Dimsum dumplings- 4 stars. I loved the flavor of the insides. It was full of good stuff!  Beef patty- 2 stars.  I was able to taste the oil from the fry, and the flavor of the patty was okay. It was a bit bland, unless you dipped it in soy sauce.   I'll be back for the cumin lamb dish, fried rice, and the dimsum dumplings! :)  Price is average for the dumplings, but a bit high for some items. Service can be a bit tricky. The interior reminds me of a Chinese New Year theme."}
{"text":"I am from Northern China, and this is as close as it gets in Vegas as far as food goes. Though I thought they could use more salt, I enjoyed everything I had.   While their lamb kabobs are only available after 6p.m., there are plenty of things to get from the menu. Dumplings are fresh and very good, I normally prefer potstickers over boiled dumplings unless they are truly good. Dumplings here are definitely good. But don't just order dumplings, their dishes all very tasty too.   The restaurant is fairly new, so it's clean and nice inside. I almost cried when I saw the menu for the first time, where else can you find authentic double cooked pork in Vegas? If you like or want to try Northern Chinese food, this place is a must. Prices are also reasonable!  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? :)"}
{"text":"Living two hours north of the city, we take our dumpling dates really seriously and usually frequent the same couple of places rated best in the city.  Based on other yelp reviews, we decided to give this place a try and were not disappointed! Service is so wonderfully friendly and the food is authentic and made to order, all day of, house made, even the noodles!!  Happy to give such a great place five well diserved stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Choose basically anything and it will be awesome! Favorites included the Eggplant, Black Pepper Beef, Soup dumplings, well really any and all of the dumplings. Just close your eyes and point, it will be good, and authentic, if that's not what your after you can still find something that you'll like, but really it's the authenticity of flavored that shine."}
{"text":"I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if the succulent wrappers used to encase the dumpling fillings are hand made and the dumplings are assemble and cook to order. It is a major comfort food category for me. In fact ?? boiled dumplings is the first item I have ever personally ordered on my own with lunch money my mom gave me for elementary school in Taipei. It was just a few pennies each and the shop made it and delivered it in a plastic bag to my school with my name on it just in time for lunch break.  I don't remember much about how it tasted, but the memory of having tremendous emotional satisfaction and joy from that simple meal is still very strong.  So while driving to try out a new ramen place a few miles down the street, the light from this new restaurant caught my eye, and I decided to make a quick,but very safe u-turn into the small parking lot in front of Dumpling King.  There are plenty of spaces in the back of the building, in case this restaurant gets super popular in the coming weeks. I was initially afraid that I was dropping in as the restaurant was about to close, since it was fairly empty inside, but looking at their hours of operation, I was relieved to see that I had 1.25 hours left.  I made a quick scan of the restaurant, and pretty much was blinded by all the red color in the restaurant.  Red floral printed seat covers over each chair.  The tablecloth were reddish in color, and the lighting was fairly dim, so yeah I was slightly disoriented from the color red.  I wonder if that is a normal reaction or it is just one of those minor details that made me just a little different from the other 6 odd billion people on this planet (not including the aliens that left zigzag lights over the skies of Hawaii).  Anyway, after picking a nearby table with good lighting for taking food pictures and going over the menu, I eventually found the \"dumpling\" section all the way on the last page under \"Main Food\" and ordered the following:  101. Beef Steamed Dumplings(4) ???? - Decent flavor, but I felt the texture of the filling was off. Like it was overground or overworked.  102. Beef Dumplings(4) ???? - Same filling as the above, except this dumpling is boiled.  103. Lamb Dumplings(4) ???? - Good dumpling, nice lamb flavor. Dumpling is also boiled and looks exactly like the Beef Dumpling.  112. Stone Dumplings ???? - This is like a big plate full of pot stickers that is cooked in a pan, and inverted onto the plate. The residual starchy water forms a thin crust that connects all of the dumplings together (see the picture).  It is kind of cool looking, but eat these fast.  Because I was taking time to take pictures, and all the food came more or less at the same time, I noticed that a small pool of oil puddle up on the plate after like 10 minutes, which made it taste not as good as the very first piece I had.  Just something to think about if you are dining solo or eat very slowly.  NOTE: Although their menu have prices listed for dumplings with portions of (4), I was told that it was a misprint and now the minimum order is (8) dumplings, so you now need to order those items x2.  But for the Beef and Lamb Dumplings that comes out to (8 pieces) for $5, not too bad price wise, but does present an additional hurdle against trying as much of the menu as possible without asking for the doggie bag.  They did however let me order four pieces of each of the Beef Dumplings and Lamb Dumplings, for a total of eight pieces, since both are cooked the same way.  Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.  Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.    3.5 stars.  I am sure another update will be forth coming should I get to try the XLB on my next visit.  Review #26 of 2014"}
