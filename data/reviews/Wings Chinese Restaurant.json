{"text":"Good quality and value for any time you don't want to cook at night. A real family pleaser for any night of the week."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese take out place to go to. I've been coming here since 2000. The taste is consistent and they never change the food items. I know the owner and his family which all work there and they are great people. The prices are pretty fair. Food is always fresh ! I love how the food comes in reusable containers and are pretty good quality too. My favorite things to order are Chicken Wings, Longlife Egg Noodle, Cantonese Chow Mein, Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls. Honestly every food item is great! You won't regret going here :) Also if you bring cash and your order is over $15 you save 10%!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great chinese food and so many options. The portions are very big and the pricing is great."}
{"text":"Wonderful Chinese take out business with the nicest people and best food deal around. At first look, I thought they were out of business (the signs and building could use a little TLC) but inside is very clean. I ordered the #5 combo which I thought wouldn't be enough food but she said \"it will be plenty with leftovers for tomorrow\". As I now sit here thinking I should call and thank her, I hope my review is read by as many as possible and try Wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered hot and sour soup for takeout. The colour of the soup is way off, it's like the colour of sweet and sour sauce instead of the darker red/brown that it should be. It came with bbq pork, chicken, and shrimp. The 2 pieces of shrimp that were included had a horrible after taste, kind of like they had freezer burn or something. Really disappointed with the soup. Maybe their other cooked dishes are better, but I personally am not going to order from here again."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 8 years, dont know what to cook? Noo problemo! Their food is amazing and I always get dinner for 2 for me and my dad.  Place doesnt look all fancy anymore since they have been open for so long but food is great and the value for it is worthit"}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite take out places ever. I have been going here since high school ! I remember my girls and I would order their amazing chicken fried rice and deep fried wings when lunch started and walk all the way from school to get them. Service is great and you get your food quickly its always ready for pick up once you arrive ! They also have some great lemon chicken! Their fried rice is so full of flavour and compliments any side dish you choose!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and will be for years to come. Don't know what it is but the food is so good ! The inside is super sketchy but it's not eat-in anyway so who cares, YUM !!"}
