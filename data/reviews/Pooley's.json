{"text":"I have been going here a long time. Since they opened. Since they had Inddor Sand Courts. The staff are friendly. Not sure about this new food service.... But I don't goto a bar for food. I goto a bar to have fun.  This place is a blast, did I forget to mention about the outdoor patio and live music.  No I do not work there. No I do not own anything. I am just someone who has always been treated right. I feel that when a place treats you right. You do the same."}
{"text":"Parking there is a pain in the ass. The ever popular MPD wasted no time in ticketing 10+ cars parked around the corner. The signs read, no parking between 10 PM and 5 AM - hrm, seems be aimed directly at the Bar business. WTF.  Perhaps the obnoxious, money grubbing city of Madison could consider issuing *warnings* first, or make the tickets a nominal fine, like 5 bucks. Oh, we can't do that and still fund the liberal bike boxes, can we ? Or buy snow making machines. So instead of wisely spending money, they'll sock it to people out and about. Way to go Madison.   The bar itself is fine, plenty of room, except, the bathrooms - they should put in MORE! There were girls in the men's bathroom waiting to use the stall."}
{"text":"Have been to Pooley's numerous times during trips to state basketball tournaments. The experience had always been good, but not today. Even though there were few patrons, waited 20 minutes for our beverages, and 45 minutes for our meal. The server was woefully untrained, and the bartender seemed to be annoyed when we asked for our drinks.  Food was just averge, price was ok. Service was poor."}
{"text":"Bottom line -  if you NEED to see your football game, this bar will have it guaranteed.  Seating is a bit limited, so get there at least an hour early to get a decent seat in front of your screen.  If you can go to a Champps, you'd be better off there. Not a bad spot to watch a Vikings game in Madison.  There will be only two games with audio at once, one of them will always be the packers.  Many TVs, but there will be one, maybe two screens to watch your game - most tvs are about 30 inches.  Food is ok.  Cheese curds were great, nachos were nothing special, wings are mediocre at best.  Frosty mugs for your beer was a nice touch.  Free popcorn too.  Grub is cheap (nachos, wings, pitchers of beer $25) The one problem I had was that we only had one 32-inch screen (with audio) for about 30 vikings fans, and they cornered us in the game room next to air hockey and basketball arcade games, so it was an annoying distraction to listen to that all game.  You would think they'd show at least two screens in that room for us. For fellow vikes, you get a great community mn experience."}
{"text":"Drinks not badly priced, good atmosphere, nice crowd. Make sure u get there early on busy days to secure a seat."}
{"text":"Ordered side salad with blue cheese dressing turns out the blue cheese dressing was made there and they added money to it. wasn't much Blue cheese in it. Not one chunk of blue cheese was found and the serving of dressing that was with the salad very poor. Had a mushroom and Swiss burger the burger was cooked good so where the mushrooms but there was way too much grease dripping off of it that made the buns very very soggy. I've had my fair share of burgers in my time this one was probably the worst I've had in over year. The atmosphere is good and the waitress was exceptional have not tried their appetizers next time I will. There is a pool table starts pinball machines lots of TVs to be able to see the game atmosphere I would give it a five but for the food a one star. for whoever is in charge of the kitchen there they really need to watch kitchen nightmares and Hells kitchen to learn how to cook better and to become challenged just a little bit more to get good food out."}
{"text":"This would be the perfect site for the TV shows \"Bar Rescue\" or \"Kitchen Nightmares.\" The biggest weakness was the waitress we had. Slow service for both the drinks and our food. This is a bar: the drinks should have come fast and furious. The food arrived before the plates. The waitress forgot my water. Waitress never checked to see if I wanted another drink. Places like this should be using mystery shoppers to test and improve their service. And this bar is in Madison, WI, where there are a million other bars one can go to."}
{"text":"This is THE greatest sports bar I've ever been in. So much memorabilia to see.   Justin was our server today.  Justin was attentive and had a great personality.  Ordered chili, which is homemade, and was served piping hot and was very tasty. My BLT was solid, and the fries were crispy and enjoyable.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Pooleys is a great place to relax, have a drink  and enjoy sports on their numerous tvs. The memorabilia alone is worth it. To those reviewers who have whined about dust or some perceived slight by the staff, get a life. This is a sports bar, not your grandma's parlor."}
{"text":"Ok crowd. Good place to see concerts. But stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service. I've downgraded this place to only a concert stop. And only then if there is nothing else going on."}
{"text":"This place is awful.    Drinks are way overpriced and weaker than a popcorn fart.  The place is filthy inside and smells like a old, sweaty jock strap.  Staff is slower than molasses and you'd see the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl before you get served.  Always a testicle festival.  No hot single chicks here.    Rather buy a 12 pack of Ultra and spend my Friday night under a bridge.  Go Packers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come for the volleyball stay for... friends who are too lazy to migrate elsewhere.  Your choice of taps are few and dismal; Capital, Spotted Cow, Miller Lite, Bud Light, and their claim to craft beer: Hopalicious. Pitchers are $12.50 for Hopalicious. A tiny Blind Russian served in a 4 oz shot glass was $6.50.  Their beer fried fish on Fridays are pretty solid. $9.75 for three pieces of fried or baked cod, choice of fries/tots/chips (sweet potato fries are extra), coleslaw, tartar sauce and a slice of rye bread (no substitutions on this one, I asked).  The breading reminds me of panko breading. It's crisp, yet light, sticking onto the flaky meat of the cod without sogging it up.   I'm surprised by the prices they charge for such a rinky dink establishment; $10.25 for a salad with some protein, $9.25 for tight wraps (not just any wraps), and $9.75 - $10.50 for burgers with toppings other than lettuce and tomato.  The bar itself is... eh... endearing? There is a ton of sports memorabilia, signed photos with prominent athletes, jerseys, mannequins modeling said jerseys and I'm sure some of the items are actually really cool if they actually took the time to dust the layer of dirt off and reorganized the display scheme. It really looks like a hoarders paradise.  The bar is W shaped, again pretty cool in idea but poorly executed because the bartenders face away from the patrons most of the time and it takes a while for them to make it to you if they are busy and stuck in the crevice of the first dip in the W.  I don't know who would rent the gym they have as a banquet. It's again, dirty, dark, and dingy. The courts are one of the hardest courts I've played on and you really should think twice before diving. I'd recommend wearing some heavy duty carpenters knee pads."}
{"text":"Nice little sports bar with pool tables and various bar games.  As a sports fan, I liked the memorabilia that is spread across the walls.  A nice craft beer selection and decent bar food (burgers + fries).  Although I was only visiting the area for a few days, this place definitely seemed like the neighborhood hangout bar.  I enjoyed the vibe, and would go back."}
{"text":"Kipps food never fails to impress! Everything on his menu is delicious.  Teriyaki wings were SO GOOD."}
{"text":"My soccer team came to Madison for a tournament the weekend of the Iron Man.  I was having trouble finding a place to accommodate 35 of us for dinner on Saturday night.  I called Pooley's and spoke to Monica.  She could not have been more helpful!  They have a game room that we were going to use which sounded ideal for my players.  I saw pictures of Pooley's on their website and it looked perfect.  Unfortunately, our plans had to change, so I had to cancel our reservations.  I spoke to Monica to let her know.  She was very nice about our cancelation and appreciated the call.  Next time I'm in Madison, I'll be trying Pooley's.  The menu looked good!"}
{"text":"I'm a sports nut so I loved this place. Indoor courts, memorabilia galore, and games for most ages. Food was tasty service was well above average. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Previous reviews were spot on with the \"not your average sports bar.\". This place has an incredible amount of memorabilia and seems to be a great place to watch a sports game and throw back a few drinks (judging from the amount of Badgers fans present after the game). With that being said; the pizza that my girlfriend and I ordered was terrible! Costing $25... I was expecting something of decent quality, but was presented with what was the worst pizza experience in my life. Not only was it under cooked and soggy, but there was something different with the sausage and mushroom (sour taste). My girlfriend immediately felt sick and only ate one piece. I hate to judge on just one experience because I understand it really depends on the staffing, but if I do ever return; it will definitely not be for the food."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. Recently upgraded the menu which is good. Drinks are reasonably priced. Good volleyball leagues too. Support this local business as they do a great job. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is fun!  Huge space, lots to do... limited parking, but park down the street.  I went there with a big group & saw SuperTuesday (great cover band, 1st time seeing them)  This place is pretty close to my place & I can see myself going more often.  There's something for everyone.  And if you are a girl, you can always get to the bar (just smile)."}
{"text":"Loud Crap vulgar rap music...no thanks...only a few people there.  Looks like they haven't cleaned the place in 10 years.  No food, was after 9 pm on playoff Sunday...go figure."}
{"text":"A huge, local Wisconsin and NFL sports bar with pool tables, arcade games, several TVs and lots and lots of sports memorabilia. Literally every inch floor to ceiling is covered in sports memorabilia and it's really fun to walk around and look at it all. This place is such a dedicated U of Wisconsin bar, the bar itself shaped in a W!   The staff was very friendly and attentive. We had some drinks, which were reasonably priced. We didn't have any food, so I can't really comment on that.   I was a temporary cheese head just passing through town, but whether you're a local or just passing though it's worth a stop especially if Wisconsin is playing!"}
{"text":"I get it, I get it... Pooley's is a sports bar. Once you get over the allure of being hit over the head with sports memorabilia up to the ceiling, you'll notice you're basically drinking in a repurposed utility garage meant to keep large tractors at one point. If you look at the jerseys and helmets, you will see a layer of dust caked on them; even some of the flags sag with dust. Gross.  They do have a gym attached, when I looked in they had a bunch of folding tables set up and some bag toss on one of the courts, as if celebrating someone's birthday at the local public gym. Looked like a party on a budget.  Saving grace? The bar was shaped like a W for Wisconsin of course. There were TVs everywhere and yes, if you have a favorite sports team not from Wisconsin, you could play a little scavenger hunt and likely find your team. These things are what saved it from a one star, also - if you're looking for a place good for groups... Pooley's has the space."}
{"text":"I had been to Pooley's only once prior to this past Saturday. I really have no desire to return ever again.   My roommates and I had heard they have some pinball machines, and wanted to check that out. Who doesn't love pinball?! Well, their pinball machines ares mostly pretty lame. The only machine worthy of your time or money is the Star Trek machine, which is pretty awesome. The others aren't so great. The Addams Family machine looks awesome, but man does it cheat!  So we did quickly glance at Yelp regarding their food, and we thought it was probably going to be mediocre...but we were hungry.  And it was indeed mediocre. My chicken sandwich was pretty basic California Chicken. It came smothered in some sort of spread. If you are going to use a cheap bun, you can't just smother both sides! My sandwich felt apart immediately. Ugh. The chicken was a little underdone as well, verging on pink. I didn't get sick from eating it, so that's a plus. I gave half of it to my roommate and he didn't get sick either. So the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived. People seem to like their pizza, so maybe go with that.  The crowd was also interesting. A bunch of bros and bottle blondes. That sums it up pretty accurately, actually. I felt some hard glares from across the bar from some sketchy looking dudes. With limited physical strength, I would absolutely not feel safe going to Pooley's alone on a Saturday night. Absolutely not. Maybe the daytime crowd doesn't look so threatening.   The bartenders were friendly, and did a great job. They should migrate somewhere else, because I'd gladly order from them again. But, I will not return to Pooley's. No way."}
{"text":"Slow service, out of the one vegetarian ingredient that I had to make up a menu item with to even have an option. . Vegetarians get hungry too ."}
{"text":"Don't bother going here to watch the NFL unless you're a Packers fan.  Refused to turn up volume in a room full of Bears fans so we could actually hear the game."}
{"text":"Came to Madison for business and wanted to try this place to shoot some pool. I was HIGHLY impressed with Pooleys. This is the ULTIMATE sports fans dream. Wish there was one in Wausau. I will definitely try to come back here."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre if a bar tender doesn't say the f word when you order a pizza and there is only 10 people at the bar at 630 on a Saturday.   To make this place even worse the ref, older guy in mustache has favorites.   I can assure you, our team and three other teams have said they won't play any more because he is rude."}
{"text":"Great food, good-looking bar, unfortunate racial experience.   The Good - The food. I love the burgers here. I got the Wake Up Burger and requested the egg to be runny. It was perfect. I'd always recommend the burgers to anyone who asks. Tater tots always come out nice and crispy as well.   The Bad - My friend was accused of stealing peanuts by one bartender when the other bartender had previously given it to him. We were charged, but we let it go. No big deal, just a misunderstanding probably.   Then, we were told that if anyone pukes, the bartender was done serving us because he had to clean it up last time. None of my friends ever recalled this incident.   NO, we do not look alike. NO, we certainly do not act alike either. I'm sorry you had a bad experience cleaning up someone's puke, but don't racially profile us that it was us, or that we'd do the same thing. Would you say that to every white person that comes in? Very unfortunate and very unfair. Very disrespectful. If he would have said, \"if anyone pukes, I will not serve,\" that is understandable to me. The second part of what he said has very different context to it.   We came to this bar because it was a friend's birthday and he chose to come here because we've had good experiences prior.   I've had good experiences here prior so I will not let this one cloud my judgement. I would still come back. However, I do think others who wish to read this review need to know what could potentially happen to them."}
{"text":"I love this bar, Its like a sports fans natural history museum.  We frequent the place about once a year after a Badger game. In the past we came here for the tons of memorabilia that is all over the place.  Must be millions of dollars in helmets, photos, equipment etc.  In the past the food was always just bar food. Not terrible but nothing memorable.  I was really pleased that they got a new food partner.  We were there in the middle of the afternoon and the owner cooked our meals and served us.  Awesome burger and fries!  Way better than when I was here 2 years ago.  Keep the Bar Rescue guys out of this place, they will just eff it up!  Keep it the way it is except replace the old tube TV's along the back wall.  Those are laughable at a sports bar!  Overall, love it and highly recommend it for the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It's like a sports museum. Great memorabilia. Perfect place to catch a Badger game. Cold beer and good mixers. We had the wings...great homemade blue cheese. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Weak tap beer line up.  Marginal service levels. Cluttered \"sports\" pub.  Take a look at the layers of dust on all the helmets on display - now thats impressive!  Why do people hold gatherings here?!"}
{"text":"Someone one please dust!  This place is huge with a ton and I mean a ton of sports stuff in it. But the layers of dust on everything is redonkulous. We had the private room reserved upstairs which is really nice but the waitress didn't want to come up stairs to get us drinks. She made that pretty clear when she said \"does anyone want anything before I have to come back up here?\"  Nice.... everyone ended up needing drinks and we had to flag her down from the balcony. I could maybe understand if it was crowded but due to a snowstorm there were like 10 people in the place.  I will say that this place has a lot going for it: Pool tables, corn-hole, boxing machines, basketball machines, shuffleboard, darts and more.  Plus there is a volleyball court inside. So you can have a pretty good time there as long as the waitress wants to serve you. We ended up leaving early because she was so bitchy and slow and went somewhere else that wanted to take our money. Her loss!  Maybe they should get her a dust cloth and have her go at it!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for any sporting event or place to meet some friends. Large open area with plenty of seating and tv's."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would just call this your typical sports bar. This is more of an unusual sports bar amusement park. While it may look busy when you first arrive due to all the cars parked in the lot, the place is pretty big. The bar zigzags around with these soda fountain type bar stools. Then there's large tables all around, TV's everywhere. A dining area on the second floor. All types of local sports and Big 10 memorabilia, banners, helmets, caps, jerseys, etc.   As far as food, they have a nice selection of bar food. Regarding beer, they could do a bit better. Some nice local brews including New Glarus. I switched from Hopalicious to Alpha King in a bottle which I was told is very hard to get. They have drink specials every day. Mostly on certain mixed drinks and standard brews like Bud/Bud light. I had their buffalo wings where they give you 8 wings, but no celery/carrots. The bleu cheese or ranch on the side is to dip your wings if they're too spicy. They had a nice dry rub with an excellent seasoning possibly with a little smoke added. Very crisp, meaty and tasty. It's nice to have flavor and spice without the sloppy sauce all over your fingers."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar layout: taps, cheap drinks and a ton of tv's. They've a semi-separate room for pool and darts.   Saw the Packers opener here. The table service was friendly and polite, and very quick with drinks.   The rounds ordered from the bar were quick, too. The bartenders were good guys, joked a lot, and seemed happy to be there doing what they do...which is exactly what I look for.   Also of note, they have an insane amount of sports memorabilia, with a ton signed, from all across the spectrum and the last six-plus decades.   This place is definitely worth a visit or two, as the atmosphere was great for the game. A bit long of a wait for typical bar food is the only drawback."}
{"text":"Pinball update! Current machines are: Addams Family, still a fav Atlantis (Bally) Star Trek World Cup Soccer  Atlantis was totally new to me at this visit but it's a really fun game for any level. Great art, great submarine sounds, a lot of fun and in great condition."}
{"text":"Great pub food.  They pour great mixed Drinks.   Friendly bar keepers.   Josh and Monica are terrific bartenders.     If you love sporting events this place has televisions everywhere.    They can host large groups anytime but I would recommend you call ahead so they are ready for you!!!  Burgers are great.  The wings are off the chain.   BW3 wishes their wings were this good.  Great sauce selection too.  If that is not what you are looking for try the grilled chicken Caesar salad better than a lot of sit down places."}
{"text":"Ah, probably a nice bar if your 21 but for me it is a lot of noise, spilt drinks, shouting to hear each other, slow service.... not a fan. Rather somewhere with quicker service, less noise....just a blah place."}
{"text":"THE WORST PLACE TO WATCH SPORTS IN MADISON!  Went here to watch the Badgers with some co-workers since we work in the area. Waited over 1 1/2 hours to receive our apps. What!?!?!!??  Never received an explanation, other than \"The Kitchen is f*cked.\".   Never will return, it is B Dubs from now on to watch any sports."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and people watching.  I grabbed a spot near the back so i could peep.  Nice place, good service, friendly staff.  Then one guy walked in and ruined everything.  He was loud and drunk.  He kept yelling about warning someone about something, he was hard to understand.  I have never seen anyone with such an undeserved sense of superiority.  It was fascinating.  Any way, I recommend Pooleys but not Hank. #teammrbo"}
{"text":"I always have a good time at Pooley's, but that is partly because I can play volleyball and watch almost any Wisconsin sporting event.  The food is mediocre at best, but they mix strong drinks for the price. You can count on your favorite game being on one or more of the ubiquitous TVs in the place. The game room is fun if you are into pool, shuffleboard, darts, etc. The volleyball courts are excellent, and they do a pretty good job hosting leagues and tournaments.  They hosted my high school graduation party years ago, and they did a great job managing the service."}
{"text":"Well i can scratch off my bucket list, my husband and I ate the most DELICIOUS FANTASTIC meal with our waiter Phil making everything perfect. I highly, highly recommend Pooley's to everyone highly recommend our fantastic waiter Phil."}
{"text":"There is a bartender that works there named Kumar who always seems to start problems with guests every time I'm in there. The place is dirty, dusty and the food is sub-par. Definitely better bars to go to in the area. I will say they have fun games to play, that would be the only thing keeping me there though"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sold on this place. Been in a couple times now and I have mixed feelings.  The place itself is pretty cool. It's huge. Full of sports memorabilia and decor. There are arcade games, pool tables, lots of tables to sit at and a very large oddly shaped bar.   Service was good. The bartender was friendly and pretty prompt. The drinks tasted good.   The crowd was very diverse. Bros and sporty people and country fellas and glam chicks and old folks. Every walk of life was there, really.   When leaving, there were several people in the parking lot mingling around. Kind of weird. Cars with loud music playing, people talking, people yelling across the lot. A little uncomfortable.   Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't awesome, and I probably wouldn't make it a regular place. I guess they have a lot of sports leagues that take place in their indoor courts which is neat, but other than that, it's meh. Just not my thing."}
{"text":"Always a fun place to hang with friends. They even have Angry Orchard on tap, my FAVE cider and on tap??? Def gained an extra star for that grand idea. First time having the Kipp's Special Personal Pizza....delish! Meat lovers delight for real! Bacon. Ham. Pepperoni.  Sausage.  !!!! It was pretty darn good for less than $10. Awesome sports memorabilia surrounds you and there's plenty of TV screens to go around for every sporting event playing that day. The menu is pretty extensive and there's even a sand volleyball pit in the back. Plenty of room for parking and easy to find. I give it 4 stars only because I don't want to come to a sports bar and see little kids running around.  This is an adult playground,  leave the kids at home!"}
