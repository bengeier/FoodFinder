{"text":"The mango and watermelon drinks are a must! The cucumber lime drink it is very refreshing and tasty. There's a wait but it's a new place that to trending, definitely going back."}
{"text":"Drinks and food look exactly like the pics. A whole lot of staff kinda just sitting around tho. That always turns me off. That is the only negative thing I can say. Everyone worked well with each other but at times drinks just sat there waiting to be topped off between breaks. I wish I could sample a drink before buying. It was hard being fully committed to all the choices. I ordered the chilotes box, best elote in AZ. Sweet and savory. The coffee horchata was bomb.com"}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours in line, location closed at 11 and been there since 9- when I got t the front of the line to order employees said they stopped serving food at 11.. dissatisfied as I was already in the store for two hours. Debating on future purchases after this."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in tonight at 9:55pm and they told us to leave because they were closed."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food tastes delicious but if you don't have 1 to 2 hours to wait in line then you should not come here.  Very popular and extremely busy to the point where I would avoid unless during off peak hours."}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of boba. I normally get boba at least once a week. I've been wanting to try this place since they opened, but it's a long drive from where I live. I happened to be in the area today so I made sure to stop by. I went there at about 6:30 at night. The line was long and wrapped around the restaurant. The good thing is after ordering the drink it didn't take to long to actually receive the drink.  I ended up getting the split cup with thai tea and matchata. I wish both drinks were delicious and I loved the idea of having two different flavors to drink from.  If I find myself in the area again I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Line can get a bit long but the stuff they sell is worth the wait! It's always packed and that's not a bad thing! Love the spicy watermelon with a mango twist!!!"}
{"text":"i have been here two time love all the drink here, especially the crystal boba I like it because I always buy one drink and leave it overnight and the crystal boba still good it doesn't get hard like the black boba."}
{"text":"Really good the elote is bomb but made my stomach hurt after, the drinks are amazing and the prices are really reasonable"}
{"text":"Zero Stars for Zero Degrees..  Just waited half an hour in line to be told they aren't filling orders for 1 hour because they got an order for 15 drinks.  No offer for discount on future visit or anything.  Amateur place. Bad customer service.  Maybe the drinks make up for it but my time is worth something, no?  Went up the street to Dutch Bros and was treated great.  Had to give 1 star in order to post this review."}
{"text":"Went there at 11am waited about 50mins in line to order got my drink in 10mins it was well worth the wait they are small best to have one person order everything mind you this is only the second day they have been opened"}
{"text":"The drinks are good and I will say that I have always enjoyed what I've orderd but it falls far below the hype and they have some kind of shady business practices. 1) for what you pay you don't really get that much  (kind of like Starbucks in that way) 2) it's a pretty small building and they run out of places to sit fast. 3) when you check out they ask if you would like to upgrade to a glass cup (you know that's cool, and sustainable, and at places like Dutch and Starbucks you get one of those \"refillable cup discounts\", so great!) but what they don't tell you is that they do not allow refills in their cups they push on you."}
{"text":"Waited a while after the grand opening & visited during their slower hours... We did expect way better and as we walked in, we thought to ourselves.. \"based off how busy they get & how fast the word/locations spread, you'd expect tables, windows and work area to be clean & organized..?\" We purchased the Strawberry Bliss which was poorly made... containing drink experience myself my team did keep separate bottles for every ingredient(or add-on); a bottle was quickly rinsed (looked like condensed milk) and then used for chia seeds... The staff was all over the place and appeared really unorganized and sloppy. Therefor I was no longer looking forward to my drink. I was unable to enjoy my tea bc my strawberries were poorly pounded & it was extremely watered down, which could explain why they add the ice last (which shouldn't be done within the ice machine) bc I got no taste of tea... I'm not a fan fan of boba but I did try the boba and I'd prefer the tapioca. As for food we got the Hot Chetto Elote which made us laugh at \"fresh from the start\" because we tasted canned corn with soggy cheese, topped off with a thin layer of what seemed to be hot Chetto Puffs crushed up in our opinion (which wouldn't have been so bad if there was more added or drop the price to 5.10) and all at room temperature.. Definitely not a satisfying taste at all.."}
{"text":"If you have plans or need to be some place after this isn't the place to go. Plan on waiting for at LEAST 45 minutes for just drinks. I ordered a simple milk tea and coffee and it took 45 minutes for something that should take no longer then 15 to wait for. There wasn't even an apology for the wait time and there were people waiting longer than myself. No sense of urgency or consideration for people's time. I understand it gets busy. But management should already account for that before they opened. Probably won't be going again. Not worth the wait time. And it was 1 pm on a Monday!"}
{"text":"The corn on the hot cheeto corn was nasty; they need to use mexican corn in order to get that taste they're aiming for. The drinks were okay but the wait time makes me not wanna go back"}
{"text":"The frozen desserts here are fantastically awesome. This is it fantastic place to take your family and friends and I would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"There is more hype to this place than there is quality drinks. We came a week after their grand opening & waited for over an hour for our drinks. My family of 4 had ordered their mangonada, pink lychee slush, strawberry mojito & a machata drink and they were all overly sweet. You can taste that they use just syrup & water in their drinks. The mangonada was very salty & watered down.  All of us were disappointed. I have tried all the boba stores in Peoria/Glendale/Surprise and the only boba place that I would recommended on the northwest side is Sumo Snow."}
{"text":"Love this place. It has ruined me for other boba places. Love the watermelon, and the snacks."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews before coming, I had mixed feelings but I wanted to try it out for myself! We came on a Saturday night around 7:30 and there was a line. We waited about 20 minutes in line and probably another 20 minutes for the drink....the fact that there's only one cashier is an issue because it makes everything that much slower. 
Anyways....I ordered the mangonada chunks with the tramind straw (that I didn't know you had to pay extra for) and it was pretty good. I will say they put a little bit too much mango and it wasn't that ripe so I didn't really eat it all. 
I saw some people getting the straw and some not, so I looked at the menu and found that it was extra after I already ordered my drink. I wasn't going to go stand back in the long line so luckily when our drink was ready we were able to pay for it then when we asked the guy. 
In my opinion they should ask people if they would like the straw with it. Not only could they make extra money by asking but people who don't know that it doesn't come with it will know. 

I have hopes for this place and I do plan on coming back to try a different drink. My only compliant is that it takes foreverrrrr."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! To explain the 4 star is only because they do not accommodate for anyone who needs a high chair to tie down a rambunctious one year old. We had to make due and take turns holding him while taking turns enjoying our food. We got the popcorn chicken box with Mangonada and I got the split strawberry horchata and Thai milk tea. We didn't really like the Mangonada with spice so ordered one without it. It's pretty busy but worth the wait. Give this place a try. I want to come back and try their different flavor drinks."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going and it definitely wont be the last! Food was amazing just like the customer service. Only con about it would be that the place is too small and there's barely any tables to sit and enjoy the food :("}
{"text":"Yeah I don't know if I ever go back especially if the weight as long as it is took an hour from the time we got in to a got our drinks and there was maybe 20 people in line ahead of us first drink I had was the strawberry mojito tasted pretty good pretty sweet but warm it took a while to get it cold second drink I had was the pink lychee that didn't taste very good tasted kind of like soap or potpourri or something like that try my wife's strawberry horchata that tasted pretty good like the boba in it price wasn't too bad it was $23 for 4 drinks but we didn't do any of the upgrades if you choose those it gets real expensive if you guys want to try it maybe give it a month or so hopefully I'll get a little easier to get in"}
{"text":"Place smells like swamp ass and lines are long, but the drinks and Hot Cheeto elotes make up for it! We would recommend the Machata, Mangonada, and Ube Milkshake for drinks!"}
{"text":"It smelled like sewer inside. Door was closed. Poor ventilation. We're from out of town and we were looking forward to trying all their snacks, but the smell ruined our appetites so we didn't order any snacks. Instead, we just ordered drinks. 

1. Jasmine milk tea with boba: too sweet and not enough Jasmine flavor. 
2. Horchata with boba: too sweet and hardly any cinnamon flavor. 
3. Pink lychee icy: too sweet although it looked pretty. 

All the drinks are pre-made and way too sweet. They don't offer options to change the sweetness level of their drinks so we had to add tea and milk to our drinks when we got home. 

Also, please keep your iPad screen clean. I reached to sign my name on the iPad after paying with my credit card and it was dirty. Bleh. 

$23.86 total for 2 regular sized jasmine milk teas with boba, 1 large jasmine milk tea with boba, 1 horchata with boba, and 1 pink lychee icy. 

Doesn't break the bank, but not a great deal for drinks that are way too sweet and not satisfying."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite place to grab a snack and a cool drink. The chilotes box (i think what its called) is brilliant! Price is awesome too."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! The food looked awesome! I mean where can you buy fresh chicharrónes that don't come in a bag? The drinks looked fantastical and delicious but I was sorely disappointed... 

When I ordered I asked the woman behind the counter for my food to go and apparently it is standard for them to serve your togo food in overflowing containers that can't close - so I had to awkwardly stand there and look at this lady and say \"um how exactly do you expect me to transport this?\" (see photos for a laugh). Let's get to the food - The popcorn chicken was extremely over-breaded and dry. The cajun seasoning on my chicharrónes and fries (which were good) was too spicy, even after asking the employee behind the counter and getting a \"if you can handle pepper you should be good\" - NOT.  

The tea's (Strawberry Bliss and Peach Blossom) I got were pretty good and I think the split cup thing is a pretty trendy idea because sometimes you just can't make up your mind, right? I thought the mangonada thing was disgusting but my husband liked it so it wasn't a total loss. To sum it up it wasn't terrible but it's not somewhere I'd go out of my way to go back too."}
{"text":"We just moved here from CA. & honestly it's been hard to find good boba and and drinks that actually taste like they are suppose to. We have gone to 4 locations and none have been good. UNTIL we found Zero Degrees!! It's honestly amazing!! They're drinks taste great!! And boba is fresh and isn't soggy or been sitting there. The Thai tea tasted perfect!! Not too sweet or over powering with tea! We also had to order more when we finished our first drinks! The staff was super friendly! We got a mangonada, Thai tea, strawberry horchata, and strawberry mint! & get this for the strawberry mint they used actual fruit and mints same for the mangonada! Loved coming here! Great atmosphere and amazing drinks!!"}
{"text":"The drinks are super bland and taste like powder in water, please work on mastering the recipes a lot better."}
{"text":"Omg so good! Not bad prices either, drinks/smoothies are very good and huge,  took us 3 days to eat the dole whip and the taramin straw is delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Tried the Mangonada and was very impressed! Tons of yummy mango and lots of flavors to satisfy my palate! Sweet, spicy and salty!! We also tried the Watermelon which was good, but I prefer the mango! Will be back! The large was enough for my husband and I to share!"}
{"text":"Loved the Spicey chicken box with the Cajun fríes. I would have given them 5 stars if it wasn't for the wait time which took 25 minutes to receive. Made lunch time a rush. The good thing about waiting was that it was cooked to order.  The drinks are crazy good and wild looking. Pretty unique spot in the Arrowhead area. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there last night at around 9:30 pm, which I believe has been two weeks since their grand opening, and I still waited for 1 hour for two drinks. Really, I don't quite understand what all the hype is. Drinks we ordered were just very average and not worth the $5 and up price.
I ordered the mangonada and my husband ordered the pink lychee slush. The mangonada was definitely NOT what I had expected and I will NEVER order again. It was really salty and quite spicy for my palette. Maybe I'm just not use to drinks like that but it tasted like I was drinking a cold salty/spicy soup. Not refreshing at all! It also reminded me of the Mexican spicy mango candy which I love but for some reason don't like in a cold drink form. The pink lychee slush was good but nothing amazing to write home about. However, it tasted like it looks; sweet, cold and and refreshing.  
Overall, I am going to wait for the hype to die down completely before I step foot into this establishment again as it is definitely not worth the 1 hour wait. The amount of time that I would wait for drinks here is probably 10 mins max."}
{"text":"The ice cream was good. The corn was a nice share portion. As for the strawberry mojito omg it was yuk.  Parking up close on a hot day is limited. The seating gets cramped and the tables not wiped down often. Would come back for the ice cream only."}
{"text":"The place is very trendy, and who can say no to elotes and boba?!! Zero has an interesting fusion of Asian and Mexican desserts and snacks that make it a very popular and fun place to go hang out with friends. I ordered the watermelon slush, taro milkshake and the popcorn chicken combo with Cajun fries. The watermelon was the best and really fresh. The taro milkshake was too sweet, but it was presented really pretty. I didn't enjoy the popcorn chicken or Cajun fries as much. The chicken was a bit dry and the Cajun fries didn't have enough spice. I would go back and try the elotes next time, since I didn't get the chance."}
{"text":"My sister and I have been eyeing this place since it has been opened but never went because of the long lines going out the doors. Today though there were no lines so we finally got to try this place out. We ordered hot cheeto elotes, a mangonada and a split cup of Thai tea and house coffee (about $18 total). The wait felt like forever! 15 minutes for 1 drink, another 15 minutes for the elote and another 15 minutes for the split cup drink! Then we had to go back in because the split cup drink was made wrong so they had to redo it which was another few minutes. Once we tried everything out we we're disappointed.. the hot cheetos elote was dry, not spicy at all and tasted like microwaved canned corn. The split cup drink was warm and very sweet. The only thing we weren't disappointed in was the mangonada. 

Don't know if I would come back here again.."}
{"text":"I was expecting more because of all the hype, but overall it felt like other boba places I've been to. I'll give it to them that their boba was sweet and above average. I got Thai tea with boba. My boyfriend got the Mangonada and it had a lot of flavor for his liking. If you like Tamarind, go for it! They have other interesting flavors that I would definitely go back to try!"}
{"text":"We waited in line for about 20 minutes and received our drinks in about 5 minutes after ordering. The customer service was EXCELLENT!! The team was so great and friendly. We got mangonada and it was AMAZING. Definitely worth the wait. We are excited to try more drinks and food items in the future."}
{"text":"A great refreshing place to go to get a nice cool drink in this heat in az the line is very long sometimes but the wait is worth it. I highly recommend the mango slush and there milk tea just very smooth and refreshing very happy they opened up this place here in az great quality drinks!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures going around social media and reading the reviews, I was nervous to come here in the afternoon on a Saturday (thinking it was going to be packed) but we went anyway. There wasn't much of a line and we got in pretty quick. I had the mangolada and it was one of the best things I have ever had.  My sister got the s'mores coffee milkshake and it was good. More on the coffee side if you like the taste of coffee. We also got the popcorn chicken box and it was delicious as well. I will definitely be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time not too long ago, it's very good. I really like their popcorn chicken! And their mangonada is really good!"}
{"text":"This place was on our todo list for some time...we wen after dinner so only had dessert...I had strawberry horchata, BOMB! My wife had the Ube milkshake it wasn't too sweet as we expected and was yummy and creamy. The kids had the mangoneada and s'mores milkshakes and both enjoyed them! We will be back for food next time!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now. The drinks and food aren't bad at all, but the wait is ridiculous. It seems like they always take a minimum of 10 minutes even when you're the only one in there. I get that some of there drinks may take a little bit to make, but they should come up with new techniques to make it more efficient. Staff is friendly overall. I'll keep going because their menu is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is not that bad. It was my girlfriend and I's first time here and it was an interesting concept! We both got drinks with boba inside and they were delicious! We also shared some food that came with popcorn chicken and fries. The food was alright, nothing too special. If any of you decide to get the popcorn chicken box like my girlfriend and I did then it would probably be best to have someone to share it with because it was A LOT of food but can't complain on that. It was a good vibe and the employees were really nice! They also played some good music. Not much room to sit though so better hope when you go that it is empty!"}
{"text":"They have the BEST Hot Cheeto Elote!! 
I Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! 
I love their mango drink as well, but I loved this place and wish they were closer to me. Anytime I am in the area I go here though! :D"}
{"text":"It was an overall good place to go for cravings, the drinks are amazing, however I found a fly in my hot cheetos elote, I went to tell them what happened the employees were very respectful and offered to remake my food and refund me my money back."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype is all about, maybe its the drink that I got that was bad, but either way I will not be returning. I am so glad I wasn't here when it first opened and people were waiting like an hour, not worth it at all. 

I had the split drink with milk tea with boba and horchata coffee. Milk tea was garbage and tasted like powder, boba was flavorless and not chewy like it should be. Horchata tasted bad and was very sweet. 

Maybe their other drinks and desserts are better but not worth it for me to make that drive to for this place."}
{"text":"We arrived 20 minutes after they had opened and the line was already very long, however it went pretty quick. The menu board was clear to read and understand from their beverage options to food and upgradable cups. The cashier was very pleasant. She definitely made an impression with everyone she came into contact with. Having someone hospitable after a long wait is very important. We order 4 drinks, 2 popcorn chickens, and 2 fries. We split the food between three people and it was plenty. They drinks were delicious. They were all very artistic but tasted even better than they looked if that's even possible. I would skip on the chicken& fries- very dry and the seasoning flaked completely off. Next time i think i will try the elotes! A mexican styled corn."}
{"text":"Definitely had to wait a long time. Probably because of the major hype. The drinks were pretty good and the presentation was nice with that mango twist. The Cajun chicharrones were pretty good paired with the Hot cheetos elote. Hoping to try more in the future once it gets less crowded and there is higher variety of selection and decoration :)"}
{"text":"I waited a month after it opened to try this place. I have seen pictures of the drinks all over Instagram, but California is a long ways to drive for boba and specialty drinks. I am excited and glad that they decided to extend their brand to other states. 

The line, yes there is a line, wasn't too bad. It took about 20 minutes. I got the house coffee and mint limeade. Both were delicious! Most of their drinks are $4-5 dollars and upgrade to a bigger size is $1 more (worth it). They also have a variety with different food items, like 3 different selections. Next time, I'll have to try the spicy watermelon chucks. Service was good and the cashier was nice and helpful.

***And to the owners-please, turn down your music! It's hard to have a conversation when you can't hear your own thoughts. We get the point, music is rad, but it's too loud. Also, it would be nice to have different music playing, not just rap/hip hop. Don't want to constantly hear about inappropriate stuff being done or what not to others. Also consider the younger age group. Their poor ears.Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We ordered popcorn chicken and they gave us one side of ranch with only not even half way filled the small container. We asked for a little more and they said 25 cent or $1 credit card. Also, we ask if they can make the drink less sweet and they said it comes pre-made so they can't. Lastly, the employee there was not even attentive or friendly. 
This is not the first time we had bad experience here. We gave them the second chance and I'm sure that is it.
This place is called Zero for a reason, they deserve zero star."}
{"text":"It was a disappointment waited in line for an hour and the classic elote did not taste good at all it was flavorless."}
{"text":"While on a recent visit back to my home state, my cousin and I were craving Boba Tea. We both had heard many great things about Zero Degrees so we decided to go ahead and check it out for ourselves. 

She ordered some fancy Mango drink and I ordered the Milk Tea and let's just say that we were both very pleased with our choice. 

It was so good that i couldn't stop thinking about so when I returned back home in Arizona i decided to check out this location. They were out of the drink that I previously had so I decided to get something different and it was nothing short of amazing. 

If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend checking out Zero Degrees, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I give this place props for bringing a different angle to the bubble tea explosion. The fusion drinks are exciting to choose from and the split cup option caters to my indecisiveness! I was disappointed, however, that the matchata (fusion of matcha green tea and horchata) tasted like milk- lacking the ricey cinnamon and punchy tea flavor of both drinks. The Thai tea was tasty, but it was preblended rather than layered. Maybe they just need some time to perfect their blends.

When I went, the line was nearly to the door! It did move, but not particularly quickly. Hopefully the traffic has died down and staff have more time to dedicate to each beverage."}
{"text":"2nd time in and was delighted thr first time, 2nd time good, just not as good. Still enjoyable and would return. Watermelon slush delish but inconsistent  (as fresh fruit can be), not quite as watermelonish today, but still yum. Also tried Pink Lychee, light and fresh... yummy!"}
{"text":"If you're planning on getting their strawberry horchata don't... I honestly was expecting it to taste like horchata. Tastes nothing like it what so ever, to my sister and I it tastes like watered down rotten milk with strawberries. So not worth the money... also not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Been here several times...I never used to mind the long lines (I didn't mind if I was getting a made from scratch drink) but now they stopped making drinks from scratch and everything is pre made mixes which are extremely sweet and they said they can't change the sweetness level. What kind of TEA place can't make unsweetened tea??? This place is a joke and they've lost my business."}
{"text":"Would I recommend: Yes! 
Review: I like their drinks along with their food! It is a good treat and though sometimes the lines get a bit hectic, they usually move very fast!
What I got: The first time I went I got a watermelon slush, it was good but a lot of watermelon. If you like watermelon you'd like that drink. Now let's talk about their Ube shake, to be honest it tasted like cereal milk so if you like that then I think it'd be perfect for you! It comes with 2 marshmallows and some gummy rainbow strip as well."}
{"text":"My first visit was over a month ago and it was awesome! I got a mangonada and it was so delicious. The place is so cute and the music they were playing was upbeat and exciting. The staff was super friendly, I was unsure about one of the flavors and the cashier brought me a sample without me having to ask. Great first impression/experience. It's right by my house so I will be coming back many more times!"}
{"text":"I definitely came at a good time..3pm! It was only two orders ahead of mine. I couldn't wait to try out the Elotes and my horchata frappe Let me say BAAAAAAAABY, It was worth the drive from Goodyear!"}
{"text":"This place is really confusing.. I like the popcorn chicken but to be honest I went there for that mango with Chili powder thing and they didn't have it on the menu. 

Maybe I was just not looking at the right thing. 

My girlfriend said the boba isn't that good, she drinks boba everywhere so she knows what's up. 

Get the chicken.. I wanna try the French Fries. They play high schooler music in this place too."}
{"text":"We love zero so so much ! Everything just amazing  my brother took me to this place and got me addicted"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this place. Thinking it is coming from California then it should be up to their level. Came here today on a busy day since they just recently open but the wait was still about 35-40 minutes. I expected the wait to be long anyways so I'm not here to talk about how long the wait is.

Sorry, but the drinks are just so horribly made. All the drinks are so water down. I got their Jasmine Milk Tea with Boba and I couldn't even taste the tea. It was so water down... 

My uncle got the strawberry lime made drink and there was no strawberry taste to it. Where the strawberry at?

Space is small and limited to seating and such. The atmosphere was musty and it kind of had a bad odor going on. Maybe bump up the AC? 

Anyways, I see that they have food so i'll be back to try their food and just bring myself some water instead... Sorry Zero..."}
{"text":"Very happy that a boba franchise from California has joined the valley!  I avoided grand opening knowing the long lines of what I have already tried but after a week or so I wanted to go to try the hot cheetos elotes. After waiting for a little over 1 and a half hours I finally got to order. The drinks the same quality as I have had it in Cali, but the popcorn chicken. The popcorn chicken is a CERTIFIED BANGER. The hot cherries elotes was super hyped and I thought it was okay. I like to call it \"deconstructed\" since it's on traditionally on the cob. From what I am used to elites is a grilled corn on the cob but it looks like they use boiled corn here which is okay still. But the hot cheetoes elotes is one of things you try and you kinda just leave at that. 

I HIGHLY recommend getting the popcorn chicken, I was almost wanting to bring my own rice to eat it as a side with it. It's that good. ALL HAIL THE POPCORN CHICKEN. 

I'm not sure why everyone is tripping about how long the lines are. It's been over a week since they opened and it's very expected so get used to it. Though I do wish it was as less busy as the locations in cali. Everytime I visit them in Cali it's never busy."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The boba is perfect, drinks spectacular and food is fantastic. This is a must see and try before you die kinda place!"}
{"text":"The anticipation of this place opening had me on the tip of my toes for months.  Ever since I saw the sign and construction, I was intrigued.  Although I lived in California when Zero Degrees first opened there, I never tried it.  So told my husband about this place and we made it our mission to try this place when it opened.  Fast forward to opening day, lines were insanely long.  We waited maybe 20 minutes and the line didn't budge, so we left.

The second time we came we were more successful.  We were able to bring our Canadian friends visiting as well.  We tried several different drinks:  the mangonada twist (generous amounts of mango with chamoy and tajin) with nicely fanned out mango as a topper, mangonada chunk (a little cheaper than the mangonada twist without the mango as a topper) with chunks of mango, and the split boba cup (marketing genius, I would say).  The split boba cup is basically what it sounds like, you can only pick two flavors from a specific list.

The gimmicky part is the mason jars, which do look cute, but don't think they are worth the price.  Also, the chamoy straw is one dollar and definitely worth it if you want that epic Instagram shot.  I have noticed that the employees handling time to make the drinks after ordering has improved greatly since it has opened.

I have returned one more time, and the lines have definitely died down because I'm sure everyone who wanted to try it has already.  I would definitely recommend any of the mango drinks.  Tiny location, only maybe four small tables max, so take it to go.  The drinks prices are a little pricey, but it's made to order and they use fresh fruit.  

Overall, a perfect treat for this Arizona heat!"}
{"text":"Thought we should try this place because of all the hype. But it's the same as any other boba place. The order taker could not hear my order correctly and even charged for an item that I did not want. Luckily a manager or supervisor noticed the error and refunded the amount. Only other issue is that there is no flexibility in customizing a drink. This is where I would go to Bubble Cups instead. If you're under the 30 crowd and don't mind being charged for an item you didn't want, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Very fun and delicious drinks! The food was also pretty good but pricey for what you get. The staff are always nice and answer every question without getting impatient."}
{"text":"Went in today 3/20/18 & DISGUSTING!! The guy taking my order had a cut on his finger there was receipt with blood trash around the register, after seeing that I told him never mind! You are handing food??!! Wth then he put green tape on his finger like that was going to help with blood dripping down. NEVER GOING IN THERE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"My first thought when walking inside the store was \"wow it smells like eggs in here..\" Definetely not an appetizing smell, but it is a busy place with a lot of unique menu items. I got the Ube Milkshake (with boba) because of how extra it looks, and of course Hot Cheeto elotes because I typically love anything with hot cheetos. 

The Ube milkshake was the most instagram worthy milkshake I've ever had and tasted similar to something like fruit loops. The hot Cheeto elote tasted good but there was too much hot Cheeto shavings in my mind; it made me feel sick and after a while the shavings got soggy which made it unappetizing. I wish I asked to go light on the shavings, but regardless it was not something I could finish on my own. 

Overall a pretty unique concept. It's definitely doing well with how busy it was."}
{"text":"Super excited to visit this place. The mangonada slush was amazing!!!  You can get it extra spicy too. Of course I did! 

I wanna go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here after seeing some ads on facebook and I got the chileotes with hot Cheetos and a watermelon slush. Both were absolutely delicious! My husband got some popcorn chicken and the hot Cheeto fries which were okay. The atmosphere was good. It took a bit of time to get us our food and they weren't busy. Also, it's pricey. It cost us about 40$ for our meal which is more like appetizers. I would come back but only has a treat. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced. After waiting 35 min for a 16oz drink I decided to ask to see how much longer my drink would take... the worker handling the tickets responded rudely and she told me there was nothing she could do that the lower number tickets were being served first (which I understand completely) however I asked about my drink because she was calling higher ticket numbers. Instead of handling it in a professional manner she decided to talk badly about me and talk about the conversation we had with the rest of the workers. I'm very disappointed and was uncomfortable after that."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, got a split cup of jasmine milk tea and coffee horchata. The milk tea was good but basic, however the coffee was REALLY good! Overall decent quality but pricey"}
{"text":"Always a winner when I am craving something snacks and spicy/sweet!  I usually order the same thing...Chilotes with a Mangonada or Spicy Watermelon.  

I want to try the cookies and cream...but I love this mix."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Cajun fries! The drinks all tasted good, but the boba kept getting stuck in my straw.  A little tip is the split cup will spill into each drink if your not careful & the food takes a long time to cook. I will be back maybe when they have been open for a while. The girls all seemed to be hardworking! Just takes a while to get it down!"}
{"text":"If you want a sugary high come here their drinks are definitely a delicious indulgence I had a taro flavored frozen shake (can't remember the name) and it was flipping delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly expensive but the price is worth it. I'm not much of a fun of spices in my drinks so I would have to recommend the watermelon slush."}
{"text":"It's okay. Worth checking out for the hype. The lines could get long and the store is literally packed, so sitting could be a bit of a problem. The smoothies are good, the chicken is good, the corn with red stuff is plainly weird. Haha. The prices are okay."}
{"text":"It's probably not worth the wait. The drinks are not even good. It's too sweet for the most part. The place is too small. With a lot of people in there, it's so stuffy. With many people in a small place, if you sit there to eat, many people are watching even the movement of your mouth. It's very uncomfortable.
The only thing we like is popcorn chicken. And that is it."}
{"text":"The ube drink was good. The layout is really cute to put on social media. The taste is great. I thought it was taro though. The price was kinda expensive $6 for a size small."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place and the atmosphere! Their drinks are delicious however the Thai tea was a little too sweet for me. The drink that I most absolutely love and always get is the Ube drink. I believe it's taro and I always get it with boba. The drinks are a little pricey they can range from $5-$9 depending on the size. Their corn with hot Cheetos is pretty delicious too but always ask with a little less parmesan cheese. The one located here on bell gets packed so fast the lines are literally outside the door sometimes. I really think they need to open another one near good year or maybe in surprise would be great. There's times when the lines are so long I honestly do not feel like waiting so I leave. And im sure many customers do the same so opening up another location would be great."}
{"text":"They basically bit off the Hispanic culture and blanded it out. The mangoneada was bland and not enough chamoy, the elote was SWEET, I repeat SWEET. It was like eating sweet corn with hot cheetos on top. There was also a three hour wait and the space is way too small and weirdly placed. I would go back if they change the corn they use and provide more lime."}
{"text":"Well today was the first day here, I wasn't that impressed for 3 reasons which are 1. It was a bit dirty and the employees were not that attentive to the lobby. 2. My friend and I got drinks that didn't have boba which the receipts said \"BOBA\" and finally the 3rd one and the one that killed the whole experience The MUSIC. I mean are we suppose to be at a club or a chill place?? Which one is it??....By the time we decided to just get up and leave it seem like the music got louder. Now I will have to give you credit for the customer service the cashier was nice, the elote with hot Cheetos was delicious, the mangoniada was on point. So being said lower your music a bit because by you doing that the customers can actually hear you calling out their number lol just saying."}
{"text":"Drinks are really good!!!!! Will come back for them, but the hot cheetos elote... no. Too dry, canned corn, hot Cheeto PUFFS taste"}
{"text":"Very refreshing drinks at Zero Degrees. I haven't tried the food yet. Clearly this is a trendy \"grab a snack\" place. There is a line halfway to the door. This place does not seem to be struggling although next to other food places. It's a teen and twenty-something place with a good vibe."}
{"text":"I waited half an hour to get my drink! There were others who received their drinks before me, even though they came after me. That's unfair!! 
They should have more employees working there, especially when it gets busy."}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing but the food is sub-par. The popcorn chicken was dark meat and soggy. Maybe some non-deep fried options.."}
{"text":"I liked the mangonada, loved the fresh cut mangos.  My hubby wasn't a big fan of the drink, but I like things with sour, salt, sweet, and spicy together... environment was fun and light... it was busy...the popcorn chicken was crunchy, but because we opted for the non-spicy for the kids, we didn't get all the flavor, so can't really rate the taste... overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!! Food takes a little white but so worth the wait. Loved the Ube milkshake and elotes, must come !!"}
{"text":"The Hot Cheetos Elotes is heaven.  Love the split cup idea.  I got the Coffee Horchata and the Machata. The Boba was a little hard in the middle but I can't wait to go back and try more flavors.  The menu is very straight forward not overwhelming unlike other Boba places."}
{"text":"Love the spicy watermelon drink! But they put little to almost none of chamoy and Tajín. 
The place is too tiny. Their hot Cheetos elotes is too dry, add some nacho cheese or mayonnaise to that."}
{"text":"I love this place the Strawberry Horchata is BOMB.COM!!!"}
{"text":"Lucky when we arrived there was no lines. My sister and I decided to take the kids out for a Spring Break treat. The pop corn chicken was a hit. The kids devoured it. The chicharones was so fresh and crispy. We really enjoyed it. The drinks were refreshing a nice compliment to the food. There is a wait between the drinks and food."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing!! The drinks are great and the popcorn chicken is simply wonderful! I come here Everytime I get the chance and will continue to come."}
{"text":"The wait - literally hours - is not worth it. It's obvious that the business is too cheap to actually hire enough staff. They are relying on everyone to only focus on \"pretty Instagram photos\" to pretend they have a high end product. Anyone willing to wait that long (for mediocre drinks at best) should really reevaluate their life and how they choose to spend their time."}
{"text":"We got the strawberry mojito, peach blossom, Cajun fries, and hot cheetos- elote. The drinks were not very good. We both didn't enjoy them very much. The fries had no Cajun flavor to them whatsoever. They tasted like regular fries with way too much parsley on them. The only item we enjoyed was the elote. The wait wasn't too bad either."}
{"text":"My first time at Zero Degrees was at the Westminster location in California. When I heard that it was opening their first location in Arizona I was excited!

I waited a week or two after it first opened. I went on a weekday around the evening but it was still pretty busy. The line went fast but getting the actual drink took the longest. I probably waited 20-30 mins from my drink. However, my two friends ordered the Hot Cheetos Elote. They actually came out really quick. 

I ordered the Spicy Watermelon Chunks which is a watermelon slush with chamoy, tajin, and watermelon chucks and I had a taste of Mangonada Twist. It was pretty good and you can definitely tell they use fresh fruits. My drink was $5.00 before tax. 

The store is really small though. Only 3-4 tables for big groups and the rest are tables tops against the wall. But the drinks and food is very instagram worthy. The taste and texture is okay but they lack in some things. I actually don't think there's a lot of options on the menu because they are all the same basic drinks. The travel bottles are super cute but so expensive ($12.99) for just a glass bottle that can't even reuse. 

I am curious about how the other drinks and food taste so I'm probably gonna come back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after seeing sooo many pictures my friends have all posted. It was really good! I ordered the Popcorn Chicken Box! It comes with the popcorn chicken, Cajun fries, a signature drink, and veggies. I got the Pink Lychee and my friend got the Strawberry Bliss tea. We're used to getting boba in Cali which is usually so much better than AZ places, but this place is actually just as good! Definitely my new favorite boba place in AZ. They actually forgot to put boba in my drink even though I ordered it and the guy was super nice about it and kept apologizing lol the place is also super cute!"}
{"text":"First time we went during the weekday the drinks were made better and less waiting time. Went again expecting the same taste and service on a weekend and definitely not the same at all! So service and taste is inconsistent. I'd rather go during the week when it's not packed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place so refreshing all their drinks are amazing but if there's a line be prepared to wait up to 20 minutes to get your drink especially in the evening times there is always a wait but it's worth it"}
{"text":"This place is different & delicious!! I've only been there 3x so far but everything I tried was so good and I will be returning for more! I think the spicy dole whip w the tamarind straw was my fave so far but the mangonada and strawberry mojito were also so good and refreshing! 
Seems to get pretty busy on Friday night. My family waited in line about 25 mins to order but it only took about 5 mins to get our drinks after ordering. Haven't seen any lines in the middle of a week day. All the staff has also been super friendly and helpful. I haven't tried the food but I see a lot of people ordering it and it looks pretty interesting. Only 1 little complaint... I think all the food is fried so you end up leaving kind of smelling like a fryer. Other than that it's great! :)"}
{"text":"Just not worth the price. I got the cucumber lime, really tasty but I finished it so quickly! Everything is fresh which is really nice! I tried it , but just won't return."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool. The food on the other hand was kind of cold, I got the chilotes box and a mangonada drink. I think the food is over priced because for what I got it, I could go to a Mexican store get it cheaper and with more flavor"}
{"text":"This place is packed, so make sure you're prepared to wait. This is another hipster boba tea house to hit the Phoenix area with a Mexican twist. A lot of their drinks are Mexican inspired, like the Mangonada with mango chunks that will take you back to an LA-street fruit stand, where fresh fruit and Tajin meet. They also offer appetizer-style snacks like French fries and popcorn chicken; but you just must try the elote dish, which is Mexican-style street corn. 
I got the Hot Cheetos Elotes, which was to die for; the elote was straight from the cob with your traditional mayo and chilli spices, and topped with a crunchy layer of Hot Cheeto crumbs (sooo good..!!) And to drink, I got the Mangonada Chunks and Spicy watermelon Chunks. They were both refreshing, yet spicy. I highly recommend you come and try it yourself! I definitely think it's worth the drive and wait. I will tell you the the scene is a little younger, since this is very popular among young adults.

Loving the LA Mexican food/ cafe scene taking over Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ate our lunch at Zupa's in the same plaza and decided on a Mango slush for dessert. VERY good.. very spicy.. I'M HOOKED. So delicious. Yes the large costs over $7 but the two of us shared it and I think that was a decent price. We will be back to try the Siracha Wings!.."}
{"text":"EDIT: We came back the following week and got the popcorn chicken with fries. First, the chicken and fries don't come as pictured. The chicken I got was tiny tiny pieced. The menu and on Facebook, the chicken and fries come in these round, silver/aluminum containers. We received them in brown Chinese take out like boxes that are much much smaller. The \"ranch\" it came with was mayo. Not ranch. Just mayo. Thought it was weird. Again Facebook pictures show the ranch next to the chicken and it looks like ranch (white with speckles of seasoning. Mine just white) The \"ranch\" I got literally looked like it just came out of a mayo squeeze tube. Pretty sure it did. They spend a lot of time marketing and posting great pictures online however it's not like that in person. Drinks are great! Food, eh. I feel like I get half ass service. 5 stars down to 3 unfortunately due to poor, misleading presentation. Isn't really worth the hype when I can get boba tea right down the street and it's not misleading. 


So good! I came here opening day on a Saturday and turned right around when I saw the line out the door. Arrived 15 min before they opened and was 7th in line but was still there for an hour. We got our drinks but the hot cheetos elotes wasn't ready so it took the longest. The hot cheetos elotes was eh. Barely any mayo so very very dry. I've had a lot better. And for it to take over 30 min for corn is a little ridiculous. Our drinks were gone by the time we got the elotes.Our drinks were delicious though! We got the Mangonada, so good! Will definitely be back for that. My hubby got a split cup with cucumber mint mojito and milk Thai tea which was both so so good! Will be back again just hoping the wait and lines aren't long, will give the food another try too."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Postmates and not only am I not going to order from Zero again, I'm probably not ever going to go back strictly due to service. The only reason why I even ordered delivery for the first time for Zero is because I didn't have a way of getting there myself. (Nothing was wrong with Postmates)

Anyway, after receiving my order I realized that it wasn't correct. So, I called to just see if I possibly did something wrong through the app or maybe it was just an innocent mistake on their part (wasn't angry at all). The lady who picked up the phone was sweet and apologized right away. She then asked a guy about the order who I could clearly hear his response and I didn't appreciate the attitude or the tone of voice. Of course, his voice changed for just a second when she handed him the phone. (Still I wasn't mad) I ignored the attitude and just repeated what I told the lady. He then almost immediately was unprofessional, rude, and finally said \"then just drive here, and I'll just add it into your drink\". This is when I got frustrated. 

I've never had a problem here and every time I've visited this place with family and/or friends the girls there have been super nice and energetic. I don't know what his deal was but it just wasn't okay. I made sure I was nice even up to the end of the call. If I could've driven there, I honestly would've just brought my untouched order and asked for a full refund."}
{"text":"Cool place with modern decor, trendy music, and a younger clientele. Ordered the split cup with Strawberry Limeade and Strawberry Horchata. Added crystal boba and coconut lychee respectively. Also ordered the Watermelon Slush in a mason jar with the mango twist. Everything tasted fresh and was moderately priced especially when you compare it to a place like Jamba."}
{"text":"Went here the other week probably an hour before closing and the line was pretty long but moved at a decent speed. Patience is key haha. The boba at this place was cooked all the way but not soggy. Perfectly chewy just how I like it and just how it should be. I've had boba/pearl milk tea all around the Philippines for the past 7 years and from my experience, they don't get the boba cooked right every single time. So I see why people could complain but this very common problem shouldn't derail you from dining here if it happens to you.

My date and I got the jasmine tea (yes! The tea is strong enough for you to taste it) and green tea horchata (tasted predominantly like horchata) split cup plus the Chilotes and I was BLOWN AWAY. The combination of them together was something else and I'll be coming back to explore the best sellers next time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Decent Elota just ask for extra chili, great drinks, long wait, CRAPY service at times. I've ordered from this location 7 plus time (because i love the food) and there is one server that gives me a hard time whenever I come. Every time I place an order she NEVER calls my number and in turn my food is usually cold when I notice it been sitting on the counter for 5+ mins. Now I wouldn't think anything of it if she didn't call anyone number however she calls everyone EXCEPT mine. This has happened on three separate occasions with the same Asian young lady that works there. Sad part is i think shes related to the owners"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 36/100

I've actually never been to Zero degrees in California despite living few cities away from its location. But in glad I got the chance to try it, and that they have such a convenient location in Glendale, Arizona! Zero degrees is located right near a freeway exit with lots of dining options on Bell Road, making it an easy post-meal trip. 

I like That they have options for just a quick boba fix, some seriously good looking dessert, or some appetizers for those homesick for the good California boba shop food!

I stoped by here twice on a weekend and found it decently empty after lunch time on Friday. Not going to complain about not having to wait! Got myself a split cup and tried their Strawberry bliss and Jasmine Green Tea with Crystal Boba. Their strawberry bliss comes with strawberry bites inside thus making it seem like it also has extra toppings that comes with the drink. 

I really likes their drinks. Comparing to some other boba chains, their regular isn't too terribly sweet. However, I really wish that they offered the option to let us choose the sweetness level for those who don't like their tea too sweet or feel slightly guilty about downing such a big drink with so much sugar in it!"}
{"text":"Interesting little place. Yummy drinks and snacks.
I Had a machata drink with matcha and orchata and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Yum!!! So happy this place is right across from my work. I will be returning. Got the mango twist, it was delicious:)"}
{"text":"The first day the opened I waited in line for two hours! But it was worth it!! There drinks are delicious and their hot cheeto elote is the best. The customer service here is great"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! Clean, trendy and the menu was pretty straight forward. I had their strawberry limeade and their hot Cheeto cheese fries and bomb were bomb! There is a wait when you arrive so prepare yourselves"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I ordered the popcorn chicken and #1 it took 20 minutes to get and when I finally get it the chicken it was grey and tasted like sausage. I'm not sure what I was eating! It was absolutely the worst chicken I've ever eaten! can't believe they would serve that to anyone! And Not only with all that going on I don't want to complain so I went to take another but there was the biggest NASTIEST LONG HAIR on my chicken! I've never be so grossed out in my life!!!!! I will say the other good thing is the drinks. #zeroforsure Don't recommend the food.."}
{"text":"Very good!!!!  There a lot of great choices.   My only complaint is that the space is very small and the items were a little pricey.  But I definitely will be back to take something to go."}
{"text":"This is a cool concept! I enjoyed my Thai Boba Tea very much and want to go back and try some of the other drinks listed. Here's my explanation on why not 5 Stars....Service. It's Always Service that can Make or Break a Business. The cashier was so lack luster....not enthusiastic about the product or my experience. The place was empty which from reviews is a rarity- so I was Happy thinking I would get a bit of time to discuss some of the cool drinks I saw Pictured on Yelp....I excitedly told her it was my First Time and what were some of the favorites...the eye roll made it apparent that she doesn't Enjoy describing or recommending items. So that being said I went with a Favorite of Mine but didn't step out of my comfort zone to try anything New....I walked out disappointed . Service makes the experience fun and exciting with energetic staff is eager to show you cool new things and encouraging you to try something with their enthusiasm towards items on the menu....why don't owners consider this and train/hire properly. Not sure I will go back- the Tea was good but nothing Spectacular, perhaps if I tried a signature drink only offered there I would've returned...another thought for the owner to consider. Too bad...I was Super Excited to Love it and it was meh...."}
{"text":"Again, the wait was stupid long even tho there were only 3 ppl there... not enough staff or what?"}
{"text":"I tried their special drink forgot what it was called but I didn't like it at all it was with the mangos and the seasoning. I then tried the strawberry mojito and it was really good!! Tasted very refreshing. Their truffle fries were also very delicious!  Excited to try their other drinks."}
{"text":"Service was good, i tried the popcorn chicken a mangonada and hot cheetoes elotes, which out of the 3 i was not too fond of the elotes im used to eating them with mexican cotija cheese and it tasted like parmesan i dont like the mix with hot cheetoes and parmesan im going to have to try them again without the cheese"}
{"text":"We went right at 11 when they opened for the first time. Our wait was about 2 hours. They made sure the people standing outside waiting had water and as much shade as possible. We tried several of the drinks, chicharrones, popcorn chicken and the hot cheetos elote! Everything was amazing! The staff was slammed with the huge crowd, but remained super friendly and welcoming! The  coffee horchata, house coffee and elotes were our favorites... but the mangonada and the popcorn chicken with homemade sweet and sour sauce were extremely delicious as well. Can't go wrong at this place! Totally worth the wait! Welcome to Arizona, Zero Degrees! So glad you are here... see you again soon :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a light weight sugary drink. Not healthy what so ever, but on the really hot days here it's nice to get a cool custom drink. I could have done without the mango stack. You pay extra even though mine was completely hard and not ripe. Other than that it was very tasty."}
{"text":"I love zero degrees! Its like a chillin place for me!I even recommended this place to my friends and they've been coming here often! Today, i ordered popcorn chicken that comes with ranch and chiccharrones..My friends and I ran out of ranch. I asked for one more and they charged $.25!I was shocked!its not expensive but how come this place is so cheap! I am extremely disgusted! I have never been to a place that charged extra for ranch! Pathetic!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Exactly what i wanted. I got the spicy watermelon and I sucked it down so fast it was so good i couldn't help myself. Tasted like when you order fresh fruit with tajin and lime juice only BETTER and in drinkable less messy form. Didn't take a pic because it was literally so delicious I didn't have time. My bf got the pink lychee and that was also super duper good and my 1 year old daughter liked it too. We ordered spicy Cheeto elote and the popcorn chicken (spicy level) which was also good and super filling, I'm pregnant and couldn't even finish mine. They guys running the place are amazingly nice and even gave me a cup of chopped watermelon to give my baby so she had a snack too! So thoughtful! 10/10 will return again."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! 

Food:

Popcorn shrimp with option of 3 different flavors. (Honey BBQ, salt n pepper, orange)

Siracha Chicken wings with an amazing sweet n chilli pepper sauce

They do not skimp on the food! 

Customer Service: 

The staff is very friendly and accommodating to any request. I witnessed a rude customer demand the works and have some bad behavior. The staff was calm, pleasant, genuinely tried to help the customer. 

I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"They usually have a long line. The drinks are expensive but are super cute for photos."}
{"text":"Overall rating is closer to a 3.5, but rounding up 0.5 because my tea was really good! 

I was super excited when Zero Degrees opened in Glendale, but wanted to wait until it had a good rhythm going before I dropped by for a drink. I went in on a Sunday night at around 8:00 pm and was met with a line. It did move quickly which was great. I went with a classic thai tea and was asked if I wanted any boba in it. However, the cashier realized that they had run out of boba while he was asking me about my topping choices and was frantically getting team members to get another batch of boba going. Welp, I wasn't feeling any toppings so that worked out well for the both of us. 

I have heard of the notoriously long wait times at this place, but was pleasantly surprised when my drink came out in about 10 minutes. The thai tea was deeelicious and definitely helped clear up my sweet tooth cravings. I may drop by again to try some of the other drinks here, particularly since there is the option of a split cup. Here's to hoping that the team here works out their operational kinks so that all their customers can have a good experience!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and the Place has some great food! The Popcorn chicken box was amazing! Let me also say I was pretty darn impressed with the awesome drink menu they have! I tried the Spicy watermelon and it was off the Chain, but I love watermelon and anything with Tajin on it is a Win in my book!!! My boys both had the Cookie Monster shakes and they loved loved it! Only thing negative was it took a bit for the food to come out but we were patient just hungry lol! We will definitely be back for late night snacks again!"}
{"text":"IG pictures got me on this place!  I had been waiting and waiting for this to open in AZ after seeing all the posts of Mangonadas and Hot Cheetos elotes. But man... 

They opened Labor Day weekend so I'm sure they still are working out the kinks, but I refuse to wait 45 mins for a drink again. 

We tried to go opening weekend and the line was out the door. It was rumored that the wait would be about 2 hours.... for drinks! 

We went a few days ago on a Friday around 2:30pm. The line was inside and it took about 10 minutes to get up to the front and order. Then it took about 35 minutes to get our three drinks and order of hot cheetos corn 

I wish they had a suggestion box because here's what me and my boyfriend noticed could've been improved:
They write on the sides of the cups or bottoms to indicate what the order is and what order number it is. The entire time, I saw staff having to look at this at least 10 times a cup. They line the cups up on the counter with no rhyme or reason so it's easy for orders to get split up. We saw one couple get one drink and wait another ten minutes for their second drink. 
It takes two or three employees to make one drink and they are all over the place putting the ingredients in. This is all while one or two employees are just standing around not doing anything. (The cashier will stop taking orders if their counter is too full of cups) 
They just need to figure out a better more efficient system of assembling drinks, because it really should not take 10 mins to make one drink. This would help out their lines. 

Now onto the review of what we got:
Thai milk tea with boba and egg pudding - normal Thai tea, nothing special, egg pudding non existent 
Split cup of strawberry limeade and coffee horchata- limeade was pretty good but super lime-y, coffee horchata tasted like a watered down horchata
Strawberry lychee slush - this was the best drink out of all of them. Good lychee flavor and refreshing
Hot cheetos elotes - very delicious and not spicy from the hot cheetos at all, could use some more mayo

Overall, their drinks are average to any other boba place. They just photograph well for IG. I don't think it's worth it to wait 45 mins - 2 hours for it though. Maybe we'll come back once they figure things out and their wait time is more reasonable."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here on Sunday and it was just delicious! The drinks were amazing I loved the taste it was just something I had never experienced before. Also I went with my two sisters and my boyfriend and they loved it too! I would totally come back again and recommend this place to anyone ! The only down side would be that since it's a small place and so delicious it gets super packed easily so it would be best to know what your already going to order so everything runs fast and smoothly."}
{"text":"I loved this place! My husband and I are visiting Arizona and decided to stop by. They have unique flavors and amazing presentation with their drinks. They were more than willing to fix a drink. Very nice staff. Definitely will recommend to others."}
{"text":"There was the longest line for this place which must mean it's really good right? Right it's reallyyyy good and unique and a must have splurge! I hate lines but I have to say worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My drink is half ice and not even full to the top. You would think I took a sip but no I haven't."}
{"text":"This place just opened up in late November and I say it's doing great. The drinks are so creative and amazing. I love all the drink options they have! They got something for everybody. The food isn't my favorite but I go for the atmosphere and drinks! The staff is friendly and helpful, the place is always full of customers and the music is very on trend and up to date. Nothing to complain about"}
{"text":"Went in here 12:00 ish awesome food and drinks I ordered a strawberry mint slushee by far the best drink that I've ever ordered. And also a jasmin mint lemonade another one so good the drinks pop with so much flavor and for food I ordered hot Cheeto with corn and the popcorn chicken I was speechless the chicken had so much flavor I was addicted I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Came here after Church's Chicken on a hot day and this place did not disappoint. I got the mangonada with the mango on top. Super pretty and yummy. Exactly what I needed on a hot day. Interior is also very crafty. Definitely a nice place to bring a date. 

Customer service: 5/5
Interior: 5/5
Drink: 5/5"}
{"text":"I went in for the first time after a friend suggested I check it out as he'd been there a few times and enjoyed the drinks. I thought the design and layout of the store was nice and the menu was appealing. Those might be the only positive parts of my experience. The female who was taking the orders didn't acknowledge me or ask if I needed any help as I stared at the menu for awhile. This seemed like the last place she wanted to be. I asked her a simple question about one of the drinks (mangonada chunks) and whether the drink would taste good without the spicy powder/topping. She looked at me with distaste and said, \"I have no idea. I've never tried it without it.\" Normally, I would be fine with that remark, but it's how she said it that turned me off. There was so much attitude in those two short sentences that I wanted to walk out of the store. The drink itself wasn't amazing but it definitely would have tasted better without the powder. All in all, I probably would not go back and if I could have placed a negative tip, I would have just because of that one employee..."}
{"text":"Sure the Instagram pictures are appealing but the service is completely awful. We ordered everything at 11:13am and our drinks came out first which took about 15 minutes but the food is another story. We were only 3rd in line when it opened so you'd think you would get your food quicker? Nope. Our Elote came our at 11:48am to be told \"we're still working on your fries\" It's been almost an hour and you're still working on our fries?? By the time you want to take your cool Instagram pic, your drink will already be melted. Skip this place and go visit your local elote man. I promise you his service is quicker."}
{"text":"Yesss, what I've been waiting for. I come from California and I've had my fair share of boba and milk tea. Zero Degrees coming to AZ is the greatest idea of 2017 lol! Ordered a jasmine milk tea with regular boba and it was on point. Not a 7 Leaves or a Half&Half, but hands down the best boba in the valley right now. Boba is soft and chewy!"}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of the popcorn chicken, however I have continuously gone back to try more of their drinks!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: So at the end I told a different girl, it was the girl who took my order. They were giving my same drink to someone who had just ordered AGAIN! and i told her, turns out the guy who i told before and who gave me an annoyed face when i asked put my ticket in the pile of fulfilled orders, the girl personally made my drink which took little less than 5 minutes.... so i got my food a little less than 10 minutes after ordering, and my drink 20 minutes after i got my food, so almost 30 minutes after i order, HORRIBLE!


 been here a few times, love the food but service needs improvement. Im currently sitting here waiting for a drink, and they gave the exact drink i order to a girl who order AFTER me, i went and complained and they told me 5-10 minutes AGAIN!! They seriously need to be more organized, I'm almost done with my food and no drink, and i drove 40 minutes for this!"}
{"text":"Oh boy oh boy Zero Degrees! First time here, got the Strawberry Lychee and Elotes Classic. Think of a strawberry slush  and the Elotes is corn, mayo, crumbled cheese, chili powder and Tapatio. This place really amped up your old school neverias and elotero lol The place although quaint, it's cool and has enough sitting for the traffic they get. Couldn't help but peek at other customer's drinks! It all looks delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had an iced house coffee that was pretty mediocre. I wasn't too impressed. But I would like to try it again ... I just know now that coffee is not the strength. Also, a tad bit overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Glad Zero Degrees came to AZ for business! Not used to the wait but it was a week after grand opening so it was expected. My girls grew impatient after 2 hours wait, staff was very accommodating to them. The toddler changed her mind from ordering to getting our drinks twice but the gal and guy behind the counter switched the drinks for her without a problem. One even upgraded my drink to a large since we got our drink and food way after other numbers behind us being called. I wanted to get the travel bottle (website said drink was included) but the young guy at the counter said only online, I would need to pay for the bottle on top of the drink so it would come out to almost $20...not worth it. Overall, I'd take my kids there again, they love the popcorn chicken and the fries but I would opt out if there's a long wait :)"}
{"text":"Went in for the 1st time today at around 7:40 pm. We had a very unpleasant experience with the young lady taking orders at the register she was very rude and impatient. She refused to sell us a mason jar and continued her rudeness thru the entire order. Keep in mind it was our first time coming here.We got order order which was supposed to be to go however it was all a giant mess. We will never go back to this place nor recommend this place to anyone else. You will regret going there. Re-Train the short girl on her customer service skills shame on you."}
{"text":"Verrrrryyy good! The food wasn't as good as I expected since we had to wait so long, but the drinks were amazing."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were pretty good, but they were not worth the long wait.  We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to order a popcorn chicken box and two drinks.  We got the drinks after ten minutes, but the food took 25-30 minutes.  Too slow for this type of thing, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I am so GLAD this is in Arizona. Otherwise, I can only get it out of state. I have spent over $300 at this place, mainly on their on-point Mangonada. The flavors taste like those childhood Mexican mango lollipops but better! You MUST try the Mangonada when you visit this place. Their wings are also delicious and you get better deal when you order the box meal! In addition, their spicy dole whip is AMAZING! It reminds me of the dole whip from Disneyland but with a fusion of Chamoy and Taijin!

This place is always busy so make sure you have at least 15-30 minutes whenever you stop by. Seating is limited and the place is fairly clean. I haven't had any trouble with this place in terms of service and food. Pricing is fair in my opinion."}
{"text":"There are endless reasons that I would come back! 

One: The drinks, milkshakes, and ice cream are purely delicious! We had the mangonada's with the mango twist, the cookies and cream milkshakes, 2 cookie monsters, and the pink lyche. Everyone was more than pleased! 

Two: The staff was very friendly and patient! I went in with a big group and I always appreciate when the staff is not in a hurry to take the order. 

Three: THE CAJUN FRENCH FRIES ARE THE BEST 

However, the popcorn chicken was frightful. Not one person in my group liked them. I ordered the salt and pepper/medium flavor and the taste was just awful. 

I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the drinks and more french fries! I would just recommend to stay away from the chicken."}
{"text":"The drink and the fries were amazing, however the service was not good. I was at the register for like 5 minutes and the teenagers running the guy were dancing joking around. I waited over 20 minutes for my fries. There was a long line and people waited a really long time.They were not professional. Amazing on the taste, however the service was horrible."}
{"text":"I've been following Zero Degrees + The travel bottle on IG for a while now so when I seen Yelp posted a hot new business and seen it was Zero Degrees I was mind blown and so excited! I visited this establishment last night around 9:20pm - exactly a week later from their grand opening. I didn't seen a line outside upon walking up to the store front but I was so wrong about the wait. The line instead of going from inside to outside, wrapped around inside their store through their tiny hallway. It literally took me a little over 2 hours to get my drinks. Yikes! I didn't think it would literally take that longggg! 

I went in wanting to purchase one of the travel bottles and also wanting to try their food selections. After almost being at the front of the line by the cash register they decided to shut off the menu screen for food. It was already 11:00pm by this time (their closing hour) with also a huge line behind me. When I got up to the register and asked about food orders the girl said the kitchen was closed at 10:30pm! Well then why is there no sign for that anywhere or why did they just wait until 11:00pm to just turn the sign off for food only?! It made no sense to me but also pissed me off because I had been waiting for 2 hours!! The girl didn't even know her inventory. I asked for one of the travel bottles and she said it was sold out and asked for another city travel bottle and she also said that one was sold out. I was so bummed. My friend saw my disappointed and asked if we could buy the display one so she went to go ask her manager. Good thing she did because little did she know, there were boxes of the bottles I wanted left! I got to leave with my travel bottle with city by choice but I won't wait 2 hours again. Needs much improvement at this store! Also, noticed that many people who had ordered drinks after us receive drinks before us! Their order of operation is not organized what so ever. 

Their drinks were good although. Tried the strawberry bliss and Thai milk tea with boba. Both were satisfactory."}
{"text":"Music could maybe be turned down because they can't hear the orders. I asked for a chilotes but they gave me a regular classic chilotes."}
{"text":"Been here several times already, and I can already tell you this place never disappoints! Food and drinks are always spot-on and I never have a single complaint. Recently had a disappointing experience at the Tempe location claiming that their regular fries were Cajun fries when indeed I knew that was nothing but a joke. Ordered the Cajun fries here, and of course they were cooked exactly how I remembered- super crispy and crunchy! The Glendale location definitely knows something about quality, keep it up!"}
{"text":"The spicy dole whip is amazing! The mangonada is as well. The service is great and efficient."}
{"text":"First time trying this was in California and I really enjoyed it. Overhearing that they were opening one up in Arizona was a sign of relief. Glad to have a little nostalgia from home. Only problem was that the hype of this place was insane. The inside and outside had a simple and not overbearing design. So since the lines finally died down a bit so I decided to stop by. Ordered the strawberry bliss, their famous mangonada and some hot Cheetos elotes. All of which were delicious and all that I remembered! Could get a little pricey if you opt to get one of their mason jars or milk jars but hey, that's a nice souvenir! Overall this place is almost, if not just as good as in California."}
{"text":"This boba place has more to offer than just boba! There are a few interesting items like corn with hot Cheetos, s'mores coffee, and mañgonadas! The staff is friendly and menu is interesting but I thought it was a bit too pricy for the taste! Our s'mores coffee size small was $6! Way more than Starbucks! If you've never been, it's still worth trying! But I doubt that we will be back"}
{"text":"The drinks here are very unique and always delicious. However, the wait can be long sometimes even when you order pretty simple drinks. Also, the place is very small and can get packed easily."}
{"text":"First timer here... I was unsure what to order but ended up loving what I chose.
For the drink, I had a sea salt green tea. It was really refreshing and yummy!
I was also craving a snack and chose the chicarrones. Then I realized you're supposed to dip the chicarrones in the elotes. The manager was awesome and gave me some to try on the house! Talk about really appreciating your customers! The snack was deelish but it's definitely a thing that calls for 2 or more to share!  I barely made a dent in it!  I will definitely be back to try some of the other drinks that looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the drinks here! The Mangonada was  10x better here than at Sumo Snow...lot more tastier. The menu was amazing and walking in, I saw so many drinks other customers ordered that I wanted to try lol

I got the split cup or strawberry horchata and green milk tea. It was really good! I love horchata and the fresh strawberries were a great touch! 

Sisters got the mangonada and enjoyed it. We also got the hot Cheetos elote combo with fries (no picture) and devoured it! Definitely a must try and worth the 25 min drive from Surprise!"}
{"text":"I've been following them on IG for a long time before they opened one up here in AZ, and so close to home! I was going to wait a while before I went to avoid grand opening lines. While patiently waiting, I'm reading all these poor reviews on Yelp. What?? I've been so excited for this place but no one likes it??

Well, Yelpers. This place is a solid 4 stars in terms of service and quality. I'm giving it 5 because they deserve some justice and a balance for those poor reviews. Most of them are upset about the grand opening wait, and that hours of waiting is not worth it at all. Well, there's not a food I would spend a few hours waiting on, no matter how great it is. 

New stores need to work out any operational kinks, and also, it's the first ever in AZ, so I wouldn't take into account the long hours of wait you willingly stood and waited. 

Now I can move on to the drinks and service. I've only had their jasmine milk tea and thai tea. Jasmine milk tea I've had a few times, and it's perfect every time. Boba is delicious. Thai tea though, was too sweet for my taste. The split cup is a great idea, but only if there was another milk tea option. They use to have the earl grey milk tea, but they got rid of it. PLEASE! Bring it back! Then I can get a split cup of jasmine and earl grey milk tea. 

Service has always been friendly. Last time I visited was the best. The guy was very patient as I asked about the drinks and just provided top notch service. 

I am definitely going back, and I want to try some food next time. Please bring more milk tea options!"}
{"text":"Lines are super long!!! Expect to be in line for at least 40min. If you go in the afternoon expect to be in the sun as the location does no have any shades or awning. Staff is helpful when it comes to ordering but double check the order as they forget to add things. Drinks tend to be on the sugary side so beware.  The popularity of this place is solely based on the amazing pics you will have for IG instead of the actual taste of the food."}
{"text":"Great drinks just wish we were able to custom our own drinks but guess not! And wish they had li hing mui Hawaiian flavor would make a killing ! Gotta try its islanders favorite!"}
{"text":"I went to try his place for the first time and I must say it was disappointing and did not even try it.  A staff member eating their lunch at the food prep station (which is visible to all customers) gave me second thoughts and I left.  There were two staff members so no reason one could not have stepped away to a break area.  I'm not interested I having their crumbs in my drink."}
{"text":"Came at 2pm on a Wednsday hoping it wouldn't be that long of a wait. WRONG. 45min just to order then another 45min to get the drinks. The staff is nice and the drinks are ok but not worth the wait. They seem to be putting 1 drink out every 4 to 5 min. Also they give you part of your order at a time. Which seems to be getting really confusing. Not to mention I got one drink and by the time my other one came my first drink was melted. They need to find a much more efficient way to get these drink out or they will never last.  It was a bummer"}
{"text":"Damn Daniel, Back at it again with the chicharrones! These photos will never amount to what the actual yumminess this contains! Mangoneada, chicharrones and hot Cheeto elote are such the perfect way to end the night. Late night cravings, check! Never disappointed at Zero Degrees."}
{"text":"Got three different drinks. Jasmine milk tea, earl grey milk tea, and pink lychee slush. All of the drinks were way too sweet for our taste. Pink lychee slush drink was literally diabetes in a cup. If you love sweets this is the spot for you. Haven't tried the hot cheetos elote yet but it is so expensive. This was not worth an hour wait for us. Staff worked really hard and were really nice! But definitely not Asian style boba milk tea."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to cool down on a hot day! Try the mango?ada and the hot Cheetos and corn topped it off! Definitely come here every week now."}
{"text":"I made a 40 minute drive from Tempe to try this place out! Even though it has been months since it's grand opening when people had to wait hours the line was still considerably long as it was a Saturday night. The guy working the register was very nice and enthusiastic despite how busy it was in there. Choosing what I wanted was the most difficult part, ultimately I got a spicy watermelon slush. I got the works and added a Tamarindo candy and mango top. Was it worth the wait? YES. Would I make another trip and wait 45 minutes for a slush, probably not."}
{"text":"Cute spot, I got a \" reusable\" glass mason jar well so I thought. You can not take them back to get them filled??? If you think this is a \"Mexican snack\" it's not at all. I got a mango drink was great, wasted my money buying the mason jar."}
{"text":"I dont know if its just me but I don't see all the hype about this place. I came in with a group of friends to try it and I honestly wouldn't wait half an hour just to get my order in. I had the Dole Whip which was advertised on facebook and was dissapointed. I do however give props on the prices which are cheap. I would recommend going on a weekday to try and avoid the huge crowds. I will come back and try their signature drinks and see if I just chose wrong. One other thing the employees are amazing they are super friendly and they are doing their best!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here! My last stop before I leave the valley of the sun. I ordered the Strawberry Horchata and was pleasantly pleased. I didn't have to wait too long for my drink as there wasn't too many people in front of me, which was awesome. To be a Friday evening, I figured this place would be slammed, but it wasn't. The menu looked pretty tasty. I would say if you live or around the area, you should check this place out. But if you're coming from a place like Chandler, like I was, you may want to reconsider the drive. The drinks are good, but not magically delicious!!"}
{"text":"Uh it was ok. Think I build it up too much in head looking at their website and pictures. They don't even hot sauce for the elotes so the elotes were a plain taste. I'll be taking my elote Home to add some Valentina. The drinks are pretty good. Service was shitty the girl messed up my order. Oh the popcorn chicken wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"After weeks of anticipation I finally decided it was time to give Zero Degrees a try. Really craving some warm corn with the hot Cheetos dust on top, I was very quickly disappointed. The corn was lukewarm at best, very dry, and tasted like it came from a cheap can. Elote should be warm, fresh, and brothy, not lukewarm and dry. I'm being very generous with the 3 stars and that's because the staff was nice and the cucumber lime drink I ordered was delicious! The restaurant could thrive, it's got a good menu, but it won't win with this poor quality. So maybe this is a place for refreshing tea's and fresh juices, but I would pass on the food. Especially the corn, it's very far from what we have come to love from the \"elotero\"."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. I ordered the Hot Cheeto fries and they were okay but didn't have much flavor. I ended up getting really sick all night after eating them."}
{"text":"This is a new spot that has been opened for about 7 months now and it's still a go-to dessert spot for our family. On my recent visit, I tried the Coffee Horchata and I was certainly amazed! For some odd reason, I was craving horchata at the time but I also needed my daily dose of caffeine. I saw the option and without a doubt, did not even dare to second guess my choice. It blew doors on my usual vanilla iced chai that I get from Starbucks. Did I mention that hot cheetos are a 5/5? Well, they have the option of hot cheeto cheese fries. Sounds terrible I know! Just kidding, loved it! French fries drenched in cheese and topped off with hot cheeto crumbs, chyummm. Highly recommend this spot for those looking to try something new in the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"This place for now will get 3 stars only because I didn't have a chance to try any of the food and the drinks didn't BLOW ME AWAY! The wait time was decent but it was 3pm on a Saturday so I assumed there would be a wait from the reviews. I ordered the matchata and the house coffee. If I had ordered just the house coffee this would be a 4 star review because it really was quite tasty. As for the matchata.... what a let down. It literally just tasted like matcha due to the obnoxious amount of matcha powder put into the horchata. It was honestly so chalky because there was too much matcha powder. And I honestly love matcha everything so this was a disappointment. I love the idea that they let you have the ability to order two drinks in one cup though. Husband ordered the Strawberry Horchata and the Coffee Horchata. The coffee horchata was bleh only cause there is no creaminess to the drink. The strawberry horchata was actually very refreshing and good. I will be returning to try some of their food options and order JUST the house coffee."}
{"text":"Me and friends decided to make a long drive just to try their soft serve. Was it worth it? Heck yeah! I got the spicy watermelon dole whip and it was so good! I also got an order of the honey bbq popcorn chicken and it was really good. The employees were really nice and got me in and out quickly but also had our food out fast."}
{"text":"Waited about 45 mins in line for the watermelon slush and my boyfriend got some oreo cookie shake. The place smelled like onions so that wasn't exactly appealing. 
The watermelon slush was something I could probably just make at home. My boyfriends shake wasn't terrible. 
Overall if I were you I would wait until the hype died down. Not really worth the long wait in lines."}
{"text":"My review is for Zero Degrees in Tempe. I did not know they opened one there! The place is nice and spacious. The drinks are really good! The ube milkshake is definitely instagram worthy! They put very little boba though, that was disappointing. Other than that I think the drinks are fairly priced. I wish they have a stamp card."}
{"text":"I can foresee this place being packed in the summertime. Can we start some sort of VIP line cutter program now? So far, I've had the spicy watermelon, spicy mango, regular watermelon and horchata coffee. Everything was delicious. I will definitely be back, if not on a daily basis then close  to it. I'm dying to try their sundaes and bubble teas"}
{"text":"Do you like random? Zero Degrees is random and they're good at it. It's starting to get hot in Phoenix and we wanted something refreshing and tasty...a watermelon slush with mango slices sounds great to me! My wife got a split with house coffee, and strawberry bliss. The watermelon slush had almost frozen chunks of fresh water melon with watermelon juice, along the straw were mango slices dipped in tajin. Refreshing is what I wanted and thats what I got. The house coffee strawberry split was cool. If you can't decide, BOOM two in one. I definitely tried both and I'm getting both in singles next time. I highly recommend the drinks we chose, and we will be going back to test out the rest of this crazy menu...cheeto elote is what I have my eyes on!!"}
{"text":"Visit 1:
Went there and there was a wait. Ordered 4 drinks and they only gave me two when my order came up so had to wait longer. I had the cucumber mint drink which is good. My kids had an Oreo monster shake. My kids loved it.

Visit 2:
Went a second time for a second chance. This time the customer service was awesome. I should have asked for the girls name. There was no line and we got everything we ordered in a very timely manner. I had the strawberry limeade and it was a little sour but good. Also tried the hot Cheetos elote dish. Pretty good. Successful 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Love this place just discovered it a week ago and already been there twice. It's a nice refreshing drink I love the watermelon drink. Nice change from coffee."}
{"text":"I don't know what age you are living in but to not have any product other than dairy is absurd. I was told by the girl at the register that they have NOTHING vegan. While I highly doubt that, I wasn't gonna risk it. If you do have vegan stuff, then try educating your staff. And if you don't have vegan stuff, then get with the times. Oh well, bubble cups is down the road and they do have non-dairy goodies!"}
{"text":"zero degrees is beautiful, inside and out. i stan her. if you have friends, take them here. if you don't have friends.. still come here bc most people are fake anyway, but not these drinks"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have a s'mores coffee milkshake that actually has roasted marshmallows on a stick. Not your average boboa place for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 simple drinks - earl grey tea, Thai tea and strawberry limenade twist (without the mango). After 20 mins, we barely got 1 drink Thai tea. Waited another 10 mins for 2 other drinks. People after us got their drinks first. What the point of you coming first and got your drink last. Super slow process!!
To Zero Degrees: work on your order process! People order first should get their drinks first - NOT AFTER 5,6 people came after them!!"}
{"text":"We always beg for something unique and creative to come to our neighborhood. This gem is hidden and very ambiguous from the outside. I walked in with my kids for an afternoon treat. I took about an hour to decide on what I wanted. We went with a watermelon slush (with giant chunks of watermelon), a fruity pebbles ice cream, and spicy Elote. All three were dynamite. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its a little pricey and the wait is long but I never regret coming here."}
{"text":"This place has been open one week and I still haven't been able to try it. Every time I drive by, the line is out the door into the parking lot and there are MAYBE 3 people working (moving slower than anything I've ever seen in my life). I tried one last time at 10:20 - they close at 11:00pm and was told my some other customers waiting for a ride home that they LOCKED THE DOORS and stopped letting people in??? Apparently their wait time was THAT LONG (there weren't that many people waiting inside) that they decided to close 40 minutes early? That's the last straw and they've lost the business of me and anyone who asks me about this place. If you can't keep up he demand you ushered in by boosting your social media two months prior to your opening, close you doors and take it elsewhere. The entire 10 minutes I stood there talking with the people who were also turned away not one single drink had been handed over the bar - that's how slow they move."}
{"text":"Originally my boyfriend and I came here on Labor Day and it was such a long wait.. like 2 hours. Omg. So we said F it and drove back home. It was crappy because we live in the East Valley. We decided to try again today. And boooooyyyyy, was I surprised that there was no wait time and I got to walk to the front. 

He got the mangoñada chunks and I got the mangoñada twist. I was really surprised how good this was. Thought this was just going to be hype. Legit love at first sip. To be honest I probably only would give it a 3 star if I had to wait 2 hours. But it was really good! I like the presentation of the mangoñada twist but I prefer the mangoñada chunks because you can taste the mango and the chile. With the mangoñada you can just taste more of the mango. It's still good just my personal preference.

Both of the drinks were 24oz and came out to about $13. Would come back."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this to open after I ate at one in California. The staff does amazing dealing with such long lines and all the questions people ask. It's in a perfect location and their fruit always taste fresh!"}
{"text":"I have never heard of zero degrees till about few months ago from a friend. 
Did I understand what it was?, no. She showed me the travel bottles on Instagram and I loved the inquire designs.

Waiting in line a week later at zero degrees I didn't expect the line to be moved down this tiny hall leading to the bathroom. What a fire hazard to squeeze in at least 30 people down this tiny hall way. Can't be safe, I rather the line be outside where I'm able to run and it quickly move if an emergency  were to arise. 

The time is about 10pm and I'm Hoping they didn't run low on anything when I order for the first time after waiting an hour to 2 hours in line. And that they should of anticipated the crowds and the  hour to 3 hour wait times. 

Finally, up to order and because it was 11 pm I couldn't order food because the kitchen closed at 10:30pm. I ended up getting the Thai milk tea in the travel bottle and it was so refreshing! Overall I would go back again despite the hour wait times. The staff was friendly and having a good time even though they look so beat."}
{"text":"Loved the split cup so I could try 2 different flavors.  House coffee is my favorite. Service is a bit slow though so it's probably not the place to go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to get my Ice coffee...it remind me of California house coffee...also very great service"}
{"text":"Worth the wait? 
I'd say yeah, usually not the type to order any fruity drinks but the mango crush was really good, pink lychee was killed within the first 10 mins and the Thai tea had a lot of flavor. 

For being a new restaurant in AZ I'd say they're doing really well"}
{"text":"We usually come here, but the last time we came in the drinks were awful and the cashier wasn't helpful so I'm not sure if there's going to be a next time."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly people they're drinks are amazing I just wish they had a closer location"}
{"text":"Honestly I always wished for something that was made with hot chettos and when I heard that there corn was made like that it was a must I loved it it's kinda far for me but once your there it's worst the drive and sometimes you could get bummed out because it gets full still as the first day but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Between my last review and now, I've been back maybe half dozen times.  Two of the visits I ordered food, including this most recent one, and both times I ended up feeling so sick.  First time I brushed it off but now this second time, I don't know what is up.  The food is delicious but I don't think I'll be ordering it anymore to keep my body happy.

I still look forward to trying out more drinks.  The Thai tea has been my favorite so far.  The wait on the weekends is crazy.  You can expect to wait up to 45 minutes, maybe more if it's super busy, if you are ordering food and drinks.  The wait time during the week is pretty much non-existent and I highly recommend going during the week if you can."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you're vegan or have a dairy allergy... no almond milk or coconut milk options. No drink options available either. I'm very disappointed since I heard great things about this place but I cannot try anything here.... please look into adding to your menu."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night and it was so packed. Waited for more than 30 minutes just to order. It was well worth it. The drinks we ordered were awesome. The girl who took our order was so sweet and answered our questions about different drinks. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Kids and I loved it. I got the Spicy Dole Whip, really good! Lots of interesting possibilities. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Scottsdale ?????????????????"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite boba place. Coming from Houston; we have so many boba shops. This place recently open and my friend took me here and I tried their Mangonada w the twist; it's sooooo... delicious! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One humid night after a delightful dinner with some \"friends\", I was taken prisoner to this place called Zero Degrees, by these same \"friends\".  They lined me up like a lamb to the slaughter where I waited for THREE AND A HALF HOURS.  

While the line creep ever so slowly to the main door, one of the prison guards came out and assigned me with the horrible task of letting any new potential prisoners know that the line ended with me and that they shall not serve anyone after me.  Just great, I won't get paid nor will I be rewarded for this task.  I believe even prisoners in prison get rewarded for whatever little deeds they do.

Anyways, once the wait was over, and my drink and meal was served, it wasn't so bad.  The popcorn chicken was very good, too bad it was nothing but crumbs, very suitable for a prisoner like me.  And the drinks...very inconsistent...some being more sweeter than the others even being the exact same thing.

Overall a fun night, and the moral of the story is.....never go anywhere on opening days!"}
{"text":"Deliciously amazing.   BEST bubble tea in the valley!   The decorations on the drinks make it even better.  My son was mesmerized!"}
{"text":"Been here three times, and I'm very happy to have waited to write this review.  It was way too busy, way to low on stock, way too rushed. Had I based my review on my first experience on their grand opening night, my experience was at a 0. 

I'm glad I decided to come here with my gal pals a second time, and I guess the Zero Degrees team worked out most of their kinks and mastered their imperfections.  
You don't master riding a bike first try, so opening night wasn't perfect and it wasn't expected to be. 

The only problems I currently have is, don't get me wrong the drinks are great. Although they can sometimes be a little inconsistent, the same drink more sweet this time, and more tart the next time. Secondly, the matcha and the horchata drinks being powder based can be really grainy. All in all, it is still pretty enjoyable.

My favorite drink so far is the Lychee Crush, lychee flavored tea with strawberry and lychee bits, and chia seeds. It was refreshing and thirst quenching!

Hands down, y'all have to try the Chilote - Hot Cheetos and the Spicy Sriracha Chicken Wings. Chilote, combination of a sweet corn elote dish, topped off with hot Cheeto powder, and scooped with a tasty chicharron. Spicy Sriracha Chicken Wings are pretty tasty as well, I feel like they are a spin on Vietnamese style fish sauce wings. Sweet, sour and packed with a punch. 

Pricing isn't great, but it isn't terrible, pretty average for a boba spot. 

I see myself coming here monthly, if it were closer? Weekly . Treat yo-self and try it out!"}
{"text":"The hot cheeto cheese fries was good.  But omg they kept messing up my drink.  I ordered a horchata frapp.  Which if u look at the menu it included coffee.  The guy makes me a strawberry drink.  I said I ordered a horchata frapp. So time goes by I get my second attempt at a drink. Still wrong.  No coffee.  I send it back and he says coffee is extra but the menu says it's included.  So I get a 3rd drink.  It's still wrong.  Out of fear they would start spitting in my drink I don't send it back.  I just don't drink it. They don't seem to know their own menu at all. I had to point out to the guy what the menu stated was in it and they still screwed it up.  For damn near 7$ a drink I expected some level of care.  This location shouldn't be your first choice. I only came cause I saw an add on Facebook that made it look nice."}
{"text":"The workers work really slow. Takes forever to get your drinks. It's slower than the Dutchbros on thunderbird. If you are in a hurry for a drink, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the twins they are such a joy to see every time I walk in. Great customer service and such bright smiles"}
{"text":"I finally was able to get here and try this place. It's very modern twist on a food fad which has grown into a prosperous business. I had the Mango drink which was BOMB only to be disappointed that they forgot my Elote with hot cheetos, uggggg so now I have to go back"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and finally got the chance to try it tonight! The split cup option and horchata influences boba tea definitely makes this place stand out amongst other boba places! I would come here more often if it was closer to where I live. Waiting for a branch store to open in Scottsdale or Tempe"}
{"text":"The hype about this place was no joke! I was not the least bit disappointed with anything I purchased here. I got a Matcha Milk Tea, my boyfriend got a Strawberry Milk, and we shared an order of Hot Cheeto Cheese Fries and Hot Cheeto Elotes. First of all, quality is there in every aspect. Hands down the BEST strawberry milk I've ever had, with the bits of fresh strawberries, it was awesome. As for the fries, they would stand alone wonderfully as well, but paired with the cheese they use and the perfectly crushed bits of Hot Cheetos, mmm so delicious! The elote easily lived up to the pictures. After a bad first elote experience, I was hesitant, but one bite and I was impressed. The lime was a tasteful addition with both dishes. We can't wait to go back, definitely worth the drive from the west valley. Friendly faces and fast service was the cherry on top!

P.S. My boyfriend loved the elote so much, he ordered another to bring home! It's THAT good."}
{"text":"This place was winners! Perfect to indulge on a frosty delectable drink of your choice with a snack that would compliment each other. Mangoadas and elote topped with flaming hot cheetos hit the spot. Wait now!! Their chicharones are fresh and crispy ready to snack on with a unicorn shake. We loved it, our kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place since they finally have one in the state of Arizona! Always had it whenever I'm in California but now having it in Arizona makes it so much more convenient! The Thai tea is to die for and the chilotes are a delicious bonus!"}
{"text":"I ordered the popcorn chicken medium with ranch to go, and it was awful. The breading tasted like garbage, and the ranch was watered down to the point where it had no taste. My wife seemed to like the Hot Cheetos Elote, but only ate half of it. One wrong move though and she'd be cleaning up the powdered mess she was served for hours. In other words, do not eat it in your car. I guess I do not get it. Most of the customer base looked like they were in middle school/high school, and the wait was ridiculous. Not to mention you're prompted to tip when you check out and treated like a smuck if you don't. Tipping is for sit down restaurants where you are served, not fast food joints, gtfoh."}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks, the atmosphere was pretty crowded and loud, not much space to move and seats were taken, also be prepared to wait a good 30-45 minutes on the weekend. Staff was friendly and it was good, probably wouldn't go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"It was the Mexican Starbucks - I'll definitely recommend if you're looking into a quick drink after or before shopping. 

The cashier was very nice to us and helped us order since it was our first time eating there. 

Definitely try the mangonada at least once!"}
{"text":"The food is good. But they take 35-45 every time Im in there also the music they play has cursing and very loud not the place for kids. Very sad to see a place that has good food go down. Slow slow slow"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my bf and I found this place. We had their popcorn chicken super spicy but I felt like it wasn't spicy at all like it was light spicyness. Although it was delicious and I was hungry so I wasn't really mad. It came with a ranch dipping sauce. We also ordered the cheeto elote. Man that was so good. So unhealthy but delicious! My bf had the peach lychee with vegan boba for his drink. I ordered the split cup. I got thai tea with boba and peach crush with boba. They were all yummy! Will we come back? Absolutely. Giving 4 stars because popcorn chicken wasn't spicy at all and the wait was too long. It took 20 mins and it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and taste! Overpriced and sometimes you wait FOREVER. But, other than that- it's a great, quirky place."}
{"text":"I drove an hr and 30 minutes for this place. Quite small but the drinks are to die for!!! And the elote was amazing."}
{"text":"Drinks are great, lots of yummy options. Look forward to working my way through the menu. Got the salt and pepper chicken and Cajun fries and both were really tasty and full of flavor even with choosing the \"mild\". Definitely was worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible place was nasty and dirty inside and my food was not cooked all the way if you want food poisoning this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"The drinks here are so delish and the presentation is as instagram worthy as it gets. The wait can be a little long at times and the service can be a little slow but it's worth the wait! The horchata frap, watermelon slush, and hot Cheeto fries are all yummy!"}
{"text":"Update: found out the Mangonada twist is only seasonal. But Mangonada chunks is always available on the menu. 

Overall: I recommend it. 
What I ordered: Mangonada Twist and Hot Cheetos Elote
Price: A bit more expensive than the average drink/boba places. Average of $5 just for the drink. Average price for the food is $5.25 (their $5 or $5.50 each)

Review:
     The Mangonada Twist drink is truly Instagram worthy. Haha. I love the color. The drink's flavor is like a salty sweet mango slush. It was pretty good. And I really like the pieces of the mango twist added onto the straw. 
     The Hot Cheetos Elote was pretty good too. Heard some people said there's no mayo (mayonnaise) in it. But there is. Either just a small amount or just a really thin layer of it. Kinda makes it a little bit dry since the cheese and Hot Cheetos are dry.
     Price: the prices for the drinks are kinda expensive since most of them are either $4-$5.50 and then toppings are extra. And if you want the food/snacks, they're also another $5-$5.50. The total of my order was over $12 including tax. Even though it was a bit pricey, I would still go again and definitely would order the same thing. But I would try the popcorn chicken next."}
{"text":"I love the items on the menu but a little disappointing. The corn was pretty dry, lacking flavor and tasted out of a can. The mangonada was good, but I love mangos sooo. And they seem a little disorganized at times, it took nearly 20 minutes to get my order. Normally I don't mind waiting, but nothing required to be cooked , I wasn't a large order and it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"I tried Zero Degrees TWICE this last weekend! So many yummy options I couldn't just go once! Great service and delicious drinks! Got their split cup so I could try two drinks each time! My husband got the mangonada and we got the kids the Ube Milkshake but forgot to take a pic of that one. Even their boba is flavorful and delicious! Their hot Cheeto cheese fries were a huge portion and yummy too! They frequently have a line but it moves pretty quick and is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the place is still fairly new so the line was long. The spicy watermelon drink is a must try!"}
{"text":"\"If you go to Zero Degrees tonight without me, I'll give you both the finger.\"

And that is how our adventure began.  Did I wait three f*cking hours for some boba on their Grand Opening?  You bet your titties I did.  I was ready to flip a table. I'm still agitated!  I won't let that affect my review but give me a minute to woo-sa, okay?

The drinks and popcorn chicken were legit. They did have some inconsistencies though.  A couple of us had ordered the same drinks as each other and some drinks were sweeter than others, some were more tart, and some were more gritty.  These were the same drink so training needs work.  It was their first official day though so we were expecting some inconsistencies but dang.  My split cup with Sea Salt Green Tea and Matchata was bomb though.  It was my favorite drink and as you can see, we ordered a lot!  Since we were the second to the last group of the night, they ran out of some stuff and our really tasty popcorn chicken ended up being majority bread crumbs and no meat.  Boo!

All in all, this is a great addition to the west valley and I'll definitely be back but not until the hype dies down.  I wouldn't wait three hours for this place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice already and I'll still keep going back. Yes it's super packed on the weekends but that's only until the hype dies down a bit. It's a brand new location in our area and everyone wants to give it a shot. Quick tip to the store; clean the tables. People spill their sugary drinks and the tables becomes sticky. Overall tasty and  refreshing mangonadas. Order them with extra tajin! Trusst me."}
{"text":"man that watermelon slush is the best drink i ever had in az im a big watermelon fan and they made it just perfect ya was a whille wait but was worth the wait that is for sure its sad to see these bad reviews about just waiting in line who cares the product was amazing good things come to those who wait and was well worth it so happy there in az now and cant. wait to go every weekend !!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday- the line was very long. Probably waited about 30-40 min- But that's obvious since it's a brand new place and it's such an Instagram hit... that everyone wants some. 

The food was okay- it wasn't mind blowing. It was cheap so I wasn't expecting 5 star food lol 

The drinks!!!!! Omg- DELICIOUS!!! When I go to places like this, I always expect my drinks to be incredibly sweet- almost like drinking straight syrup. 
Not this- it was refreshing and the perfect amount of sweetness!! I got a small because I didn't know what to expect- I wanted to go back and get a large but again the line was long... I got the slushee- my friend got the iced drink. Which if you want to enjoy your drink get the slushee- because the ice drink she finished in less than a min. Lol 

I see this place being a big success- hopefully they open a bigger location!"}
{"text":"The elote (both classic and hot cheetos) was amazing. Tastes exactly like the guy selling it at a cart. A little TOO much cheese for my taste, but definitely a 10/10. 

I also tried the mangonada! AMAZING! One of the yummiest drinks I've had and I appreciate the mason jar/milk bottle upgrade options. 

So glad this place is nearby & in the state!"}
{"text":"Before you criticize someone, you must compliment them. I love how they went the extra mile and added the cute little string along with a heart and cute message. It literally made my day seeing that. I do not know if they continue to still do this but I went here on November 24 and they gave me my drink with this. I paid for the milk bottle but they put the cute message on it. Now... right off the bat in the photo with the drink being filled you can see that the ice is 60% of the bottle with a few pieces of boba. Like literally the boba looks non-existent and I paid an extra .50 cents for it. Basically paid .50 cents for five pieces of boba. The drink was delicious; it is one of my favorites alongside the strawberry horchata. This drink is the Matchata (horchata matcha). But I wish they would have been more generous with boba and lesson on the ice. I would have asked for less ice if I knew the bottle was going to be filled with 60 percent ice. In the second photo is how much ice is left after I have drank all my drink. I am a very very slow drinker (would probably take me 20 minutes MINIMUM to finish this drink), so you know that there was A LOT of ice. The ice should have been already gone but no there is still a lot of it. I was pretty disappointed."}
