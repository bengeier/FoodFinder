{"text":"Not good.  I've had their pizza delivered before and it was good at times and bad others.  First time eating at the restaurant.  Employees were arguing with raised voices and the tension between them was tangible.  They took turns waiting on us and trash talked the other employees while participating in some kind of awkward one-upmanship.  They also have a kids play area that is just an open room off the dining area and kids were screaming and playing very loudly which was disruptive.  Can't blame the kids for having fun, but having that room for them right in the dining area seems like a bad idea.  Maybe a door on the room would help? The combination of feuding employees and rowdy kids made for a chaotic and uncomfortable experience.  Then we ordered.  Got a 4 topping pizza with their 'Professional' sauce which is pesto mixed with alfredo.  When we got our food the pizza had the wrong sauce (if it had any sauce at all...it was hard to tell).  It was also missing 2 of the 4 toppings.  We ordered a large so we'd have leftovers and had most of the pizza left when we finished. We asked for a box we were told that we couldn't have a large pizza box (that would have fit the remaining large pizza perfectly) but instead could only have small, flimsy restaurant carry out boxes.  Our leftovers overfilled two of those little boxes.  Not sure why they wouldn't just give us a normal pizza box.  They pizza itself is just ok.  In my opinion you don't get your money's worth. The taste is ok, but not exceptional.  For $22 we got a rather sad looking, flat, sparsely topped pizza that wasn't even what we ordered.  We won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone we liked."}
{"text":"Love this place! Our first time there we couldn't decide what to get and our waitress was super helpful. Then the table next to us got their food and someone from the back brought us breadsticks because it \"wasn't fair we had to watch them eat\" even though they were there long before us! Just a very nice gesture by their staff. Super cute atmosphere and good pricing!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Everything on the menu is great--I just wish it was easier to choose. The only downfall is price. They don't have the cheap pizza discounts others may have, so when we choose pizza, Roman Candle loses based on price alone."}
{"text":"Slow service. No napkins. Hummus was bland and the crackers were plain and grainy. Ordered the Hot-Wa-ii and was met with bland and unflavored pizza. Doused in Parmesan and red pepper flakes it became edible. No real saving grace here. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Preface: MY FAVORITE FOOD/DRINK IN THE WHOLE WORLD IS PIZZA AND BEER..... THEY HAVE BOTH. Please pay special attention to the \"you might also consider\" bar right above this review and go anywhere but here..... Service is non-existent... Food is not good.... I really can't be more disappointed. I have had two terrible experiences here and I'm happy to say I've had my last."}
{"text":"I love the Roman Candle in Middleton so when it came time to have a group meeting/dinner, I thought I would try RC Fitchburg. Called ahead and asked to \"reserve\" a separate section for my party of 10 which they did. Asked how crowded Monday night were and was told they are pretty quiet....not so much as it turned out!  The service was great---set up a \"buffet\" for us with our pizza and salad choices, kept us supplied with drinks (even as the place filled up). Unfortunately, it did get very busy (lots of families with loud kids) so for a group our size it was difficult to hear. And, although there were other tables available, a rather rude group of four decided that they wanted to sit where our food had been set up and ignored the server's suggestion that they sit elsewhere---one of them even began to move our food off the table until she was stopped by our server. Some people really have no manners!  We ordered off the standard menu- one veggie and one meat loaded and bith were very good. The salads were fresh and the house dressing is great! My only complaint is the price----their pizzas are good but seem a tad overpriced for pizza.  Bottom line: good pizza, nice staff and a bright airy (if a little loud) atmosphere---just watch out for rude fellow diners!"}
{"text":"In the past I would have given them 4 stars, but now it is only 1.  It seems there is either new management or ownership. The customer service is not good. Two times in a row, they forgot to make one of my pizzas. The menu has changed and I just don't care for the attitude I get when there. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place in Madison. It has never disappointed.  I do consider it the best pizza place in the Madison area, but let's be honest--Madison is by no means a hotspot for good pizza, but this place is always pretty good. The price is fair, and they do pickup and delivery, which is what we tend to do.  It even has a big area in the back for kids to play in. They will have a good time here.   For a fun night, go to the Atomic Koi next door/across the hall and have the Roman Candle pizza delivered there. The fancy drinks there will make the pizza taste even better."}
{"text":"Eh. I like the fun vibe. I like that you can order whatever pizza you want by the slice. I like the spinach salad.   The water tastes funny & is never cold. Not sure if it's just our misfortune or if they don't have very high standards, but our service has always been very lackluster & pizza by the slice always comes out cold."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza Ever! We ordered the Marco Pollo described with special mariners sauce, garlic butter, red onion and special recipe chicken with herbs and fresh parmesan. It was dry and tasteless and looks like it was made yesterday. Will not go back. Just look at the picture."}
{"text":"Roman Candle used to be a eccentrically humble establishment, when did they turn into a pretentious shell of themselves?  Came here on a Wednesday night to a scattered dining service.  We stepped up to the counter to place an order for 14\" Hot-Wa-ii pizza (canadian Bacon, green peppers, red onions, and a sweet chipotle drizzle), add pinapple which totaled to $20.48 before tax.  The guy at the front register couldn't wait to go back in the kitchen area and chat with his co-workers. We waited and waited for what seemed like half an hour with no communication or explanation for the delay.  I didn't mind paying $20 for a pizza back when this place had soul, but now the place appears void of the least bit of hospitable service. They try to bill themselves as a modern friendly neighborhood pizzeria. Instead the blas√© attitude of the employees permeate the entire restaurant.  Not on my list of recommended pizza joints."}
{"text":"Very good but not as good a Falbo's or Ians.  If you live in the area it is the best for miles around.  Service is good and the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out.  I had heard good things about their pizza and was into the whole vintage/retro decor vibe that I was hoping to find here.  I was greatly disappointed.  We walked in around 2 for a late lunch.  The entire restaurant was void of customers as well as employees.  A few moments passed before a young waitress came out and told us we could sit anywhere we liked.  Problem with that was probably 6-7 tables were loaded with empty dishes waiting to be bused and cleaned.  Not sure if they had just finished up a busy lunch rush or were just lazy in getting things taken care of.  Actually we couldn't find an actual \"clean\" table in the entire joint.  They were all kind of greasy and smudged up with gunk.  We ended up choosing a table near the back that was in view of the kid's area (which my daughter was super stoked about after showing her pictures from Yelp).  The table was extremely wobbly but we figured we would make due.  We were sitting looking at the menu when all of a sudden a got a big whiff of buffalo sauce.  I looked around and noticed I had sat my phone down in a big smudge of it.  Luckily I had not gotten any on my down coat.  I asked the waitress if she could clean up the table a bit while I went and washed my hands and phone off.  I came back and the table still wasn't truly clean.  We decided to move to a different table since that one was broken to begin with and I didn't feel like asking her to clean it again was going to get me anywhere.  My husband and daughter went into the playroom while we waited for our pizza which gave me a chance to look around at the \"scenery\".  This place is FILTHY.  Beyond filthy.  If the dining room looks like this then I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like.  I understand it's winter but the bases of all of the tables are caked in salt residue.  The bottom fronts of the booth seats have sauces and who knows what else dripping down them.  The fan is filthy and has what looks like 5 year old balloons entangled in it.  There is an area that houses their seasonal plants and some are tipped over with soil on the floor.  Even the plastic bill holder that the tab came in was disgusting.  It's just beyond acceptable.  It seems like the owner has completely turned a blind eye to this place and it's in need of a complete overhaul.  Hell, close it for a week and do a deep scrub of the entire place and I am still not sure it would be enough.  Eventually our pizza came and it was fine.  Just fine.  Nothing great.  It's just pizza.  When taking into consideration that the restaurant is filthy, I wouldn't even bother coming here.  Not even sure I would get take out since I can't trust the cleanliness of the kitchen.  The kid's area is a nice idea but the carpet is dirty and torn, and half of the machines just took our money without allowing us to play.  I love the \"theme\" and idea behind this place but it needs A LOT of work."}
{"text":"Roman Candle is open in Fitchburg!  This is great considering Fitchburg, especially the Research Park area was lacking a bar and restaurant ever since Kelly's closed down, needed a new bar and restaurant.  So, on the third night open (Jan 16th) my wife and I decided to go try the new establishment and the pizza that people talk about.  I want to say upfront that we had a great experience here and do not let my rating reflect on if you should try it or not.  You should!   If I was not such a pizza snob I might have liked it better but I have spent my life finding great pizzas all over the world.  Plus they would not let me do a 3.5 rating.  We did have a bit of a wait to get our table (the place is new....duh) and after we were sat down the atmosphere was a great little pizzeria and is kid friendly and fun.  The wait staff was friendly and I was hoping the pizza would be just as good.  We did order an appetizer of the garlic cheese bread with marinara.  it was good but it seemed to be missing a garlic taste.  But it was good.  Then the pizza came....as with my previous reviews I order a basic the first time I go to a place as to have a measuring stick to rate with.  So sausage and pepperoni for myself and my wife got bacon, tomatoes, and perchutto on her half.  The pizza was good.  Not great, no bad...just good.  I hate to say it but thats what I thought (i really wanted it to be great).  Nothing about it made me jump for joy and scream \"this is amazing\" like I did last week in Chicago (see my review a few back).  So, 3.5 stars for the Roman Candle Pizzeria in Fitchburg (so a 3 on the yelp scale).  it was just too....just \"ok\" for me.  it will be interesting when the bar opens next door in March.   I wonder how long before some drunk at bar time tries to get into the ice cream cooler."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, never going back!!The manager at the fitchburg location actually knows how to make things worse. Went for lunch late Sunday afternoon, there was only one other family at that time. Everything was moving at a slow to dead pace. It took more than 40 minutes to get food on the table. My soup was cold, spinach salad was missing beets and the kids individual pizza slices were the smallest I have ever seen. The server came to check on the food, and we mentioned that the soup was cold. A minute later the manager came out and very unapologetically explained that he stuck a thermometer inside the soup in the kitchen and that it is hot. He also had the genius to theorize that the soup bowl must have sucked out the heat of my soup. He was clearly not interested in hearing any feedback and did not care about customer satisfaction. To top it all after offering to take the soup off the bill, the manger actually instructed the kid working at the counter to not change the bill. It's amazing how he saved $4, lost customers and earned this review. Can't understand why he works in the service industry!! For the amount they charge for their pizzas they should really take their service and management more seriously!"}
{"text":"The staff today get a 5 star for their service.  There was some complications in the kitchen with our order which delayed our food and timing of all the entrees arriving at the same time.  The waiter and manager personally apologized and then comped our children's meals.  I felt like they truly wanted to make sure we still had a great visit and would not hinder our return.  Well done and noted! Our family's visit today was great and the ice cream at the end was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this place since 06/30/12 because of my last experience. Here's a snipe of my previous experience and review:  \"The last time I ordered a pizza for pick up, I ordered the meatball sub pizza. For some reason, they didn't use cheese, did not add the hot peppers, and didn't even slice the pizza. For $22, at least slice the pizza! ...I won't be returning.\"  Today, my wife wanted some cheese sticks to go with our homemade pasta. She suggested Roman Candle Pizzeria because it is literally down the street from us. I was very apprehensive. I swore I would never go back. Well, my wife wanted it so I ordered it.  I ordered at 6pm and was quoted 15-30 minutes for pick up (not delivery). I arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes later. Honestly, I was hoping for a better experience. The manager went to \"find\" my order. After 5 minutes, he came back and said they just put the order in and it will be another 15 minutes. Come on...really? I give you a chance again after over 2 years and this is how you show up? He apologized and said he would deliver it to my house when it was ready.  So 45 minutes after I placed the order for simple cheese sticks, it arrived at my house. The only reason I am not giving this place 1 star is because the manager personally delivered it with a pint of Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream.  Nice effort, but maybe I'll try again in a couple years."}
{"text":"I have been to the Fitchburg location 4-5 times over the last 3 months, pizza is fresh, sauce delicious, toppings are excellent. Most recent trip was last week in August, wife and I were in late but service was attentive and food was great. Had BBQ chicken pizza - had not tried it before, but it was very good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went at noon on a Tuesday and there were only 3 tables of 2 when we arrived. Took forever to get our order taken and when we asked the manager if someone could help up she snapped and said they were short staffed. The place was dead so between the manager, waitress and cook I didn't understand what relevance that had. Pizza and salad lunch combo was great. Loved the food but hated the staff."}
{"text":"Service was REALLY slow, even though we were the only people in the restaurant in the middle of a weekday. There were plenty of staff there, but they seemed to spend all their time chatting and folding napkins.   Took forever to get our pizza: my friend had soup and salad and was done by the time the pizza arrived for our kids and me. Some of the pizza was barely warm, the rest was too hot to touch, and it was all dry and needed more cheese.   Everything here is very expensive, even the $7 lunch special is a rip off when you add it up. The Algo Malo pizza is quite tasty, but costs an arm and a leg even for a small pizza.  The only thing that made this restaurant worthwhile was the children's play area. It has a table with trucks and toys, books, and even a projector and VCR with animated movies."}
{"text":"I decided to try Roman Candles pizza after reading a lot of reviews about them and they actually delivered to me in Fitchburg, which not a lot of places highly rated do.  Usually I want a pizza and I get a salad with a pizza but in this case I actually wanted a salad and figured I'd get a pizza with my order just to sample some pizza.  So with some trepidation I placed an order for one small (12\") PPPepperoni pizza and one large House Salad. I called and placed the order, total with 2-2 liters of Diet Pepsi was $35 and some change.  They told me it'd be 45 minutes but there was a knock on the door at the 20 minute mark.  I got my whole order and they actually remembered my Diet Pepsi which was a big plus.  Whenever I order Diet Pepsi they usually forget it or bring regular Pepsi.    I first tried the pizza (see my pic) and it was pretty good.  It was like most of the reviews here have said, not extraordinary but not bad either.  The three different types of pepperoni were nice.  You had the little square pieces, the large thick pepperoni and the flatter, thin pepperoni.  The crust was not fantastic but not bad, the cheese was pretty good but not overly abundant but the sauce was pretty bland and not enough of it.  All in all it was good pizza but pretty overpriced at $16.99 for the pie in my opinion.  The salad was quite good (see my pic) and they did remember to provide the Vinaigrette and French dressings.  The bacon was extra crispy and the cheese was delicious.  However they were very skimpy on the tomatoes, I only recall one cherry tomato that was cut in half in the salad and they were also stingy with the cucumber.  Oh yeah and just overall the salad itself was not big enough.  Quite delicious, especially the dressings, but not enough of a salad to justify the $8.50 price IMO. Also, just a note on the Vinaigrette, I know some folks order this dressing because of the lower calorie and fat but this vinaigrette is pretty thick and very fat-laden tasting and I don't think it'd be something to really be proud of healthwise.  Roman Candles makes this and it's damned delicious but I think I also killed my fat and calorie count by eating it.  It's so thick it's almost like a chocolate sauce.    All in all this is pretty good food, the salad was actually better than the pizza IMO, although too small.  It's certainly better food than any fast food pizza you will find from the chains but I do agree the price is too high for what you get.  For $40.00 worth of food (including a $3.xx driver tip) you should get more than 2 decent sized meals IMO.  Perhaps this place would be better to order from when (and if) you can find a special or a coupon to use.  I'd def. order again but only if I could find some sort of online deal or something like that."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked here and were hoping for a good meal. However what we got was expensive, slow, and a little less than average. First, when we walked in we didn't get any greeting. We then proceeded to wait a couple of minutes until someone came out from the back with not too great of an attitude. She sat us far away from the register, which we were fine with, but then realized it was way harder to get her attention from there. Strike.   We ordered breadsticks, salad, and a pizza with a side of mac and cheese. The breadsticks came out almost immediately and were really good. Probably because we were starved from our walk and waiting. We waited about 15 more minutes and the salad came out. The salad was a small side salad and was fine. Its hard to mess up a salad but I was still wondering why it took so long since there were only 2 other couples in the entire restaurant. When the pizza finally came out we found that they had burned our first one so that is why it took so long for it to come out. At this point I was okay just passing on the mac and cheese, but I inquired anyways. It came out almost immediately, but was that gross greasy, left at the bottom type mac and cheese. Needless to say, I had one bite and stopped eating.  Lastly, before we paid, I decided you know what....you can't go wrong with chocolate shoppe ice cream, so maybe this will salvage the experience, but guess what? The ice cream even had an old taste to it. Like it had been in there and over frozen and then thawed out again.   So overall, not a great experience. I don't need to come back, which is sad because it was close to my friends place and in a great plaza."}
{"text":"I eventually called because the mobile online   seemed buggy at best. I placed a phone order and the guy in the other end set me up with what I wanted quickly.   I went in and the place is cool inside, an area for large groups towards the back, with the nice booth setup it would be a great date spot especially with the Atomic Koi right next door.  I ordered the BBQ pizza and it's amazing. Exactly what I expected. Sometimes chicken at pizza places can be dicey but theirs tastes great. I'm a big fan of the BBQ for sauce. I also like that they use a lot of local ingredients. I will be returning for both dine in and more carry out, can't wait to try more of their pizzas."}
{"text":"I've reviewed another location before - but this is the one closest to my house - and I thought it was worth reviewing again. The pizza here is excellent, but the staff at this particular location are awesome. Always friendly and happy - zero complaints about the food or the service. One of my top 4 go-to places in town! Yum!"}
{"text":"Boring.  The moment you walk in the restaurant is just so plain.  Sure there are bright colors but nothing stood out.  Boring.    So I order my usual pizza sausage and green pepper.  It was ok.  Nothing stood out.  The pizza was ok.  That is it.  I can barely finish this review.  It was not bad, it was not good.  It was just there.  We had a Groupon, so I took a chance.    It is pretty far off the road.  A bit annoying to find.  Also annoying?  The loudness.  The tables make you feel like you are eating with your neighbors.  I understand children must eat as well but to allow the amount of noise that was occurring to go unaddressed was unacceptable.  Needless to say, I was SO happy to go.    Thank god for the Groupon because the prices are not worth it.  Please go somewhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"Very, VERY pleased with Roman Candle Fitchburg.  I live in the area and frequent the watering hole next door. Roman Candle staff is friendly, the food is quite good,  and they even deliver across the hall to the bar I'm in. Just ordered some buffalo chicken pizza and wings. Loving it."}
{"text":"I've went here for the last 5 years because I live in the area and after a lot of left downs this place is now a huge 1/5 Star. The specialty pizzas are alright if you feel like spending more - a lot more for what you can get downtown. I ordered Mac and cheese, paid $2 extra for broccoli (doing it to try and make myself feel maybe a little more  healthy. Got home  - no broccoli, normal me ok darn but $2 extra and then to be short changed - Not ok. $9 regular Mac and cheese and then $11 get real.) This isn't the first instance of dissatisfied service I have had here. If you're going to charge this much for pizzas in the suburbs you need to at least follow through with what you charge for and then make up for it in service. Such a waste. Avoid this place there are a lot better restaurants in a half mile radius."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the dine-in situation here. We've ordered pizzas to-go from here multiple times before and it was alright. Definitely nothing to write home about. So last night we decided to dine in with our 1.5 year old because we heard they had a play area for kids. Well this area is only good for older kids who can play arcade games. The little play structure they have is broken and pretty shoddy. The service was ridiculously slow. They apparently only had one cook in the kitchen. But they also had literally 4 tables to serve. That broke everything apparently. So it took them 50 minutes to get our order out. Add that to the 15 minutes it took the waitress to come take our orders. By which time we were all hungry and cranky. Other tables around us were also getting pretty upset, especially since the packers were playing in 30 minutes and people wanted to go back home. They did try to make up for it by giving us free soup and discounting the total amount as well. But overall this was a pretty pathetic experience. I don't think we will be returning here."}
{"text":"This is right next to my mom's condo, so we eat here when we visit. I think their food is pretty good, and I like the different varieties of pizza and toppings they have.  We have The Pestoral, but we have added their veggie appetizers and I have had their Caesar salad as their Spinach Salad. I think they're both pretty good, but I would ask for the dressing on the side.  I recently noticed they have gluten free crust, but it only comes in 10\" size/personal pizza. I tried to order it on our pizza, but we needed the 14\" for three.  The Spinach Salad with beets was also solid. It had beets, spinach, candied walnuts, berries, and blue cheese crumbles on a bed of spinach. I ordered it with the raspberry vinaigrette. Yum.  I think it's great and definitely not main stream Dominos or Pizza Hut. Also, our server this visit was really energetic, friendly, and attentive. She was great."}
{"text":"We tried Roman Candle because it was close to our hotel and they delivered, after a long day we didn't want to go out.  The pizza arrived faster than expected and it was hot and yummy! The candles sticks were great and more than two people needed or could eat. I would definitely get their pizza again when I'm in Madison.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the order on line option on their website did not work well."}
{"text":"My wife and i wanted to try a new pizza place in our area, and we decided on this on to eat inn. Nothing special. Also, it was crowded with families....and little children. We were there around 6pm on a Friday night.   The waitress managed to stay on task and fill my soda when empty, so that was a plus. We ordered a large sausage and green pepper pizza. It was a thinner crust, kinda like New York style meets thin crust. Decent tasting, and enough cheese and toppings. I would give the pizza a solid 3.5 out of 5 by itself, as for the crazy atmosphere, well there was just too many families for my liking. 2 out of 5.  Great place for mom and dad to take the kids....not so great for quiet pizza dinner."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering ahead of time. We live nearby and on 3 separate occasions have either placed an online order or called for pick up, but the pizza is never ready when they say it will be. Twice they hadn't even started making the order by the time we got there saying they had an unexpected rush. Then we're promised the pizza will be ready in 15 mins which usually turns into a 30+ minute wait. What's even the point of having an online ordering option? The pizza is okay, but would not be my first choice due to slow service."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I have not had a good experience at the Roman Candle, correction, I had one....at the original on Willy Street.  The other 3 have been awful.  Food might have been great, but the bad customer service outweighed the quality of the food.    Experience summary: 1) too much butt crack at the middleton location 2) lost my pizza order on Super Bowl night.  had to wait for it....luckily I have dvr.   3) first worker was too incompetent to tell me where they deliver, and the second employee hung up on me when I was trying to give them my pizza order.  I told the manager I gave them 3 chances and I won't give them anymore.  Glass Nickel for life."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" pizza place cuz it's in our neighborhood. Always good service and a nice selection of pies. A good place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! James, our waiter, was extremely accommodating and made sure to make our first time here wonderful! Their pizza was delicious with a perfect hand tossed crust. The fireworks sauce was really tasty and not too spicy at all. For 3 of us to eat, we have 3 sodas, a medium pizza and an order of garlic breadsticks with dipping sauces. Without tip, it was $30. Great deal for dinner! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Do not go on a Friday night or order a pizza because they cannot handle their popularity. I ordered a pizza and they say ready in 20 minutes. So I showed up 25 minutes. Took them another 5 to find my pizza and they forgot to make the Caesar salad I order. That took another 10 minutes. SO I had to wait fifteen. No one was in charge. It was Chines fire drill. The \"hippie\" (blond haired guy with glasses) that handled by order did not even offer an apology for the dismal (and that is being kind) service. They just lost my takeout pizza business."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and our server was great. I'd do 5 stars but I think the prices were too high for the portion sizes on the slides es and garlic bread."}
{"text":"Not generally a Roman Candle fan... But when you are enjoying libations next door... and they hand you a table number and deliver your order to your table at the Atomic Koi... Well that's good service."}
{"text":"I've only tried and loved one thing at Roman Candle and that's the vegan destroyer.  It is such a great pizza and has more flavor than any pizza I've ever tried.  I hope I get this right but I think it has basil, green olives, pine nuts, and a red pepper sauce.  I order mine without the pine nuts and  add jalapenos instead and I love it!    The people who answer the phone are super pleasant though I must note that on most occasions they are late with delivery.  That's kinda not cool but they are super apologetic when they do arrive so I guess that get's a pass.  They have a ton of different options and the quality of their products is top notch. I can't say that I would try anything else on their menu since I've found what I think is the best thing they offer but that shouldn't stop you from doing so!"}
{"text":"Very over-priced. Paid $42 for 2 large pizzas with 3 toppings each. When I asked what a large pizza cost without toppings, she said \"you didn't order one of those.\" When I rephrased the question, she gave me the price WITH toppings. We ordered on the phone for pickup, and there was no itemized bill."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here.  They have regular to some pretty sophisticated toppings. I recommend garlic and roasted red pepper drizzle.   It's the best American pizza around the neighborhood if you eat it hot and melty. It doesn't keep or reheat very well, so don't order more than you can eat right away. It's a big enough difference that you should probably go pick it up or dine in on weekend nights.  I tried their Jalapeno wings today and they blew me away. They were better than other pizza places and better than Bufallo Wild Wings. Good chicken flavor! Lots of nice hot spicy sauce! If it really is just jalapenos in there, then there's, like, a fuckload of them in there.  Candle Sticks are a naked pizza crust, underseasoned, consistently doughy. Get their garlic bread instead.  Food today was delivered by what appeared to be a stage magician, so added bonus."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a takeout pizza. Everyone was so friendly and helpful that they really perked up my night!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in  Madison. They have a nice thin crust and good veggie ingredients.  They also have good  salads.   I've been here twice this summer and the service was fine both times.   One thing, I wish they had oregano in shakers on the table. They will give you some if you ask but having the shaker is nicer."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Roman Candle for a family dinner. We had horrible service. After a long long wait we were served burnt pizza with the promise that new pizza would come and we could keep both. The pizza was not worth the money. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out food multiple times from this Roman Candle location and it has been great each time. While we are sipping a cocktail over at the Atomic Koi, I usually dip over to the Roman Candle to order a pizza, salad, etc to go. The food is usually ready by the time we finish our cocktail. You can also eat your food at the Koi (they will bring plates and napkins to you), if you want/need to. We ate at this Roman Candle location for the first time over the weekend. We ventured in during a slower afternoon. The service was great as we were the only ones in the  place. I did see a couple of others stop in to order food or to pick up food. We started with a small salad, followed by their 'Professional pizza'. My greek salad was good, but it was dripping in dressing. I had to pour the dressing out of my bowl as there was a lot of it on there! The veggies were fresh and tasty though. Their 'Professional pizza' is one of my favorites. You have to have it with red pepper and grated parmesan on it though. So good! They have a rewards program. They have a happy hour (M-F). They have lunch specials. They have daily specials. They have emails that keep you apprised to their daily/weekly specials. There's a game room for the kids. There's a patio area to eat. This place can get pretty busy on Fridays and Saturdays. Save room for ice cream! They have boxes for your pizza leftovers, in case you \"need\" ice cream."}
{"text":"Agree with what others have said.. extremely over priced and poor service. Waited twenty minutes for a call-in order."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and do really enjoy the pizza.  It is quite good.  However, the service is pretty unreliable.  I've had some very good service but, the last time I was here it was not so good.  The lone waitress was working her butt off while a couple of lazy co-workers plodded around and took up space.  It took ages to get our food.  Service would have been much better if people helped the waitress rather than just standing around doing impressions of sloths."}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from Roman Candle.  Before I realized there was a Fitchburg location (and therefore delivery in South Madison), I was resigned to pizza highs (making it myself) and lows (ordering cardboard from cheaper but crummier pizzerias).  Roman Candle fills my desire for REALLY GOOD pizza delivered to my door!  Of the 15 specialty pizzas on the menu, we've only tried 5.  My favorites so far are the Algo Malo (beets & blue cheese!) and the Professional (broccoli! bacon! delicious!), but everything has been great.  All of the pizzas hold up for breakfast the next morning as well (although eventually Algo Malo's arugula has to be discarded), so I feel fine ordering two pizzas for two of us and eating them for the next three meals!  I only wish they delivered later, pizza is sometimes required after 9pm (10pm some weekends)!"}
{"text":"So I have held off writing an update thinking we were just hitting off nights but 3 strikes your out.   Strike 1 - We went on a Friday night, it was busy but they were turning tables. We watched as others were seated and orders taken but we were ignored. We said something and a waitress came to the table and said she didn't know we'd been assigned to her. Our order was taken but we were forgotten again. We watched as new customers came in and were waited on and served and our pizza never came. After an hour I complained and said we needed to be leaving soon because we had tickets for a show. The assured me our food was coming. 15 minutes, no food. 20 minutes, no food. 30 minutes later we left taking our pizza to go to eat cold after the show. Very disappointed!  Strike 2 - We ordered a pizza to go. I arrived to pick it up and was handed the pizza. I looked at it and it appeared as if a piece was missing. The clerk said it just most have slid in the box. It just didn't look right.   Stoke 3 - We went in again and ordered apps and a pizza. Wait time was better but service lacked again. One app was fine the other was cold but we got no plates to use. I tried to get the waitress' attention but she didn't see me or ignored me (however we were seated 6' feet away from her as she stood behind the counter). She took the app away and brought it back warm an snatched the only plate we had (from the first app).  The pizza came and thankfully it was fine. When finished I asked for a to go box because we had half the pizza left. She brought me a box that was about 6x6 to stack all the leftovers into. It was ridiculous. While we were there I also purchased a $100 in gift cards because they were offering an extra $25 GC when you did. I jumped through the hoops and submitted my request but never got the $25 GC. I called in an spoke to the manager Brennan and explained our past experiences to him. He told me he would look into the GC issue an get back to me. As for the other issues he said I should go online and submit my feedback so the higher ups would know.   This use to be a great place to eat but the food quality and service have slipped drastically since my first review. We're now on the hunt for a new pizza place that has reliable customer service and serves a quality product."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have had excellent and timely service each time I've been to Roman Candle.  The staff is always very friendly, and the manager is great.  This is my favorite pizza place because they use local ingredients as much as possible as well as grass fed beef.  They have lots of very unique pizza options, and everything I have tried is good.  BBQ Chicken and the bacon cheeseburger pizzas are my favorite.  Another feature I like to take advantage of...if you are next door at the Atomic Koi (bar), they will bring your pizza over to you!  The only downside to Roman Candle is that it's a little pricey, but I don't mind paying a little extra for high quality ingredients (local/grass-fed).  You can find discount coupons pretty easily though."}
