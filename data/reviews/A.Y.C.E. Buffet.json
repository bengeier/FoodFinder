{"text":"Enjoyed a terrific lunch at the A.Y.C.E Buffett.  There were so many great food options.  I love love loved there Vegan selection from the fresh pressed carrot and beet juices to the jackfruit enchiladas.  The variety of salads is also excellent, the Arugula, fig and blueberry salad was my favorite.  Also, so many choices for dessert...too many great food selections to list, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  Will be back for breakfast and dinner.  A must if you have out of town guests."}
{"text":"AYCE is awsome. To go from  perfectly smoked BBQ ribs to vegiterian black bean pasta on one plate  is A foodie dream come true....so Is design ur own ice cream sandwich. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"O.m.g. the food here was so delicious .and the service jere was outstanding..people were all polite ti me and my family.also the manger was so polite her name was Freshta she treated us like family..thank u palms casino for haven great staff we had a awesome night there also took kids to movies after the buffett...i would recommend the buffett to friends and family.."}
{"text":"Just a typical buffet. After reading the reviews, I was hoping for a great food experience. I suppose it was confirmation that a buffet is just a buffet! Nothing spectacular and all the meats are always dry and lack good flavor. The best item was the mustard salmon. There was not much else to comment on. For 21.99, go to a non-buffet place and order something you want. On the plus side, the service was very nice."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite buffet in Las Vegas! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the cashier was very slow at the beginning.

Large variety of food from around the world. Much of the food like shrimp cocktail, onion soup, and lasagna was served in individual dishes. All seemed very fresh."}
{"text":"Fantastic buffet! Waited about an hour for lunch. This is a great deal with or without the card. Tons of different stations with small, individualized plates. Recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"I am an ESL Teacher at a school here in town and wanted to take my class of 25 students to the buffet for lunch. I called earlier in the week and spoke to Facia, the Assistant Room Manager, who informed my that they are unable to take reservations, but would do everything in their abilities to accommodate our large party.

Our group arrived shortly after 12pm on a Thursday and the line was minimal. Facia and her team did an excellent job of processing payments and seating our party in groups to expedite the process. We were all able to sit together at 3 large tables right in front of the dessert station.

Honestly, I'm not normally a fan of buffet food, but was impressed with the quality and selection of the food offered. My 3 favorite items (which were recommended by Facia) were the lemon pepper chicken wings as well as the pizza and stromboli, cooked in their hearth oven.

Our 2 waitresses, Wendy and Embet, did an excellent job keeping our drinks filled and clearing our plates. They were both very patient with my students, as they are from 9 different countries and have various English language skills.

Overall, I would definitely recommend A.Y.C.E. and will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. The food was delightful. We found so many wonderful things that work if you are doing Weight Watchers. From the salad to the roasst turkey breast, all was wonderful quality and taste. Loved it!"}
{"text":"New buffet at the Palms, nice upgrade from the previous buffet here. 7 stations: Smoke and Fire, The Hearth, The Roaster, World Pan, a vegetarian station, salad station and dessert."}
{"text":"We came here to see what the newly remodeled Palms Casino has done with its all new interiors and restaurants.  The designer has done a great job in transforming the previous dark and crowded casino into a more open and seamless layout.  The place looks larger and full of energy.

A line was already forming at the buffet when we got there around 6p.  The separate President/Chairman line didn't fare any better than the regular line.  The management needs to fix this problem !!  Once we were seated, service came quickly.  In addition to the standard buffet food staples, we also tried: onion soup, gumbo soup, seafood boil, honey walnut shrimp ... etc  Overall, the food quality is higher than the Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino Resort.

Good location and another buffet choice."}
{"text":"This may be my new top choice for near-strip reasonably priced buffets ($20 dinner price).
This place is a good example of the latest Vegas trend of newly remodeled, upgraded buffets with a modern feel and higher quality food.
I didn't expect much of a strip buffet under $20, but this place is actually quite good and offers decent selection of great quality food. No crab legs but some good selection of seafood, ribs and beef brisket for meat eaters, and even a vegetarian station. The selection of desserts is also quite good. I would compare the feel and the quality to a more prestigious buffet like M.
On the strip I previously preferred Planet Hollywood's Spice Market buffet, but now I may be visiting this buffet at Palms more often."}
{"text":"My brother wanted to try this buffet at the Palms and I wasn't disappointed. It wasn't great but certainly not the worst. All the food was fresh and well spaced out. I had some smoked brisket, sweet potato mash and assortment of combinations of food. Our server for drinks was very observant and made sure our drinks were filled and we left a good tip. Good desserts!

The bad: My mom says the Asian food was very salty. my brother says the beef wasn't tender and I tried a smoked turkey leg that tasted like wood.

Overall it wasn't a bad place to try. I paid around $16.00 for dinner after getting a players card"}
{"text":"The wife and I visited this place today, 1/22/2018, after hearing about the renovation and changes.  We have been to the )Palms many, many times over the last ten years or so. Eaten at the original buffet, Bistro Buffet and now the A.Y.C.E.  It was great and the price is right on point.  $43.00 for two of us including all taxes.  

The place is brand spanking new and bright and cheery.  Every employee we met was outgoing and friendly.  Our table waitress, Nacine, was on top of her game.  We were greeted quickly and drink orders taken.  Through out our meal she checked on us many times to check on our status and to see if we needed anything else.  Plates taken away quickly and table left neat for the next round.

Okay to the food.  This buffet puts our smaller containers of food and therefore keeps everything much fresher.  Items were replaced immediately.  Here's the list of what we tried.  We kept portions very small to try many different things.  We had:

Duck with white bean, General Tso Chicken, Walnut shrimp, Mussells, falafel patties, tuna poke, salmon poke, shrimp cocktail, cerviche, lemon caper cod, blackened talipia, smoke bbq ribs, smoked brisket, pork meatball in creamy polenta, green papaya salad, Brussel sprouts,and then desert:  lemon meringue, opera cake, sugar free pecan bar, cappuccino gelato, vanilla gelato, chocolate éclair, macaroons.  All of the deserts were  small in size, but packed with whopping flavors.

All of the fish dishes were moist and cooked to perfection, the cod was a little bland needing more salt.  The big stand outs were the General Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, and all of the smoked  meats, plus the entire desert bar area.

I've seen a couple negative reviews of this place and based on our experience I just don't know where they get the negative.

We have lived in this area for a good while now, 7 plus years, and this was just plain good food and done well with great employees.  We even stopped one of the floor managers, Helen, and told her how pleased we were with the new A.Y.C.E.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were enlightened to find a vast array of food choices. The environment was pleasant, clean, and the staff very welcoming and helpful. Our \"Party table\" had USB connections to charge our cellphones."}
{"text":"What a great buffet. I have had buffet in other station casinos but this is by far the best one. The prices are reasonable for the food. Love the way the organize the food. Service by far has been the best. Larry was super sweet and had great customer service and the manager Marry was funny and understanding. They are doing a great job at the palm with their buffet. Can't wait to come back again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Super good! I love what they have done with the place food is delicious  staff are very professional & the Champagne used for the mimosas is perfect"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while on a short trip to Vegas with my hubby. 

They are located inside palms hotel and cassino. I was surprised to see how nice the inside of palms is Now. It looks like they renovated recently. Very clean and nice furniture. Plenty of parking too! I mention all this because the location and environment totally affects my experience. 

Now to the Buffett.... super cool decor. Clean. Organized. Nice service by staff. We had to wait one hour in line for our Sunday brunch, but to me was worth it. The price is right, $22 pp for brunch. They offer a good variety of foods and great dessert selection! Brunch Includes mimosas and champagne too! It's short of 5 stars because I though the food was a bit cold and some dishes too oily. They could do better there. I just Did not eat those. 

So if you are looking for the buffet experience at an affordable price in Vegas this is the place!"}
{"text":"My Favorite buffet in Vegas. I don't typically like buffets because I always feel the food quality is poor, however, that was NOT the case here. The dishes looked beautiful and tasted even better. The fresh pressed juice shots were delicious and so refreshing. The wide variety of vegetable plates was impressive. The food looked like it was actually prepared by a human. This buffet actually DOES have something for everyone in your family; meat lovers, vegans, sweet tooth, the adventurer, etc. The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Truly an awesome place to eat. Wish it was closer to my house and work because I would be there everyday! And you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite buffet. After remodeling, the menu changed from good to CRAPPY. There are no good choices... very disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried all of their daily buffets and some special ones they offer for holidays. 
Variety and quality are great. The only thing I miss here is some granola - yogurt - fruit based choices. They offer a couple of cereals, but options in this department are limited."}
{"text":"Got to do this on opening day!  Hadn't done the old one, so I can't compare to before, but did like this one. Very interesting to have a Vegan station.  While I'm not vegan, I did try and like a few of their dishes.  It's not necessarily spectacular in their selections, but the price is very good. I'm sort of guessing it'll go up in time.

Many portions are served in their own container, not unlike Wicked Spoon (one of my fave buffets in Vegas), which is a nice touch.  Also like how the desserts are actually small, so you can sample them without wasting."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome awesome great food great atmosphere lovely place. I was blessed to be able to stay at the Palms. Even if I didn't I would make the trip just for this buffet."}
{"text":"Excellent and Ebony was lovely.  She took good care of us with a smile and friendly words.   She made us feel very welcome and we will return and will request Ebony.  A real delight.   The food was very good as well.  They have done a good job and the other employees we talked to were pleasant and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Super impressed! We went for lunch so it was only $12 which I couldn't believe. The atmosphere was nice, newly renovated and kind of had a hipster vibe. Everything I tried was good which is unusual for a buffet, they also had some unique dishes like flamin hot Cheetos elote (omg!) and buffalo Mac and cheese. I don't eat meats, only fish, but the meats looked really good. They had vegan desserts labeled which I thought was nice and gelato station. The service was good as well. I wouldn't hesitate to go especially for the great prices, you get $1 off if you have a players card FYI."}
{"text":"The Palms recently remodeled and the buffet reopened
as AYCE.

It is not quite a carbon copy of the common Las Vegas buffet.
More than half of the dishes are gourmet type food or
foreign food.  There are several unique flavors, most
of which are tasty.  In spite of the large assortment
and eclectic variety, my favorite was the old-fashioned
mashed potatoes

Worth a try if you have a coupon or discount."}
{"text":"The selection is limited. They have bit of everything but not in quantity. The flavors are good. Service was attentive and restaurant was clean. 
The hotel still offers free parking which was a plus for me."}
{"text":"This is just another stations buffet don't be fooled. The food sits out all day dries up or gets funky. You were warned."}
{"text":"Currently ranked at four stars the experience and food was underwhelming. Three star buffet at most(in my option of course). I went on a Friday night and the place was not only much smaller then expected for a \"Vegas strip\" buffet but the food choices were not comparable to other four star buffets on the strip. Also the photos posted on various social media do not appear to match what was actually served. 

For those who love seafood, like crab, they do not have anything other then shrimp. None the less, the server was fantastic and very kind. Other customer service personnel appeared to be pleasant. 

I would recommend the buffet at Binions, Mainstreet Station. Similar price, more selection, same quality food, and they have crab legs on Fridays or weekends I believe. 

For the seafood enthusiast and lovers go the the Studio B buffet at The M on weekends. Currently four stars and not comparable to anything else I've experienced yet."}
{"text":"Went with friends to eat here last week and checked in with them and we all got sick at the same time. I have since only gone to work where no one is sick. This place needs to take some better precautionary health measures like sneeze guards and sending sick employees home. Buffets as it is are known places to transmit viruses, honestly they should also refuse guests who look recognizably sick."}
{"text":"This buffet is a 4 step up from the previous buffet. everything tasted good. I really liked the buffalo Mac & Cheese the most and the onion sliders. The BBQ chicken pizza was really good. This buffet is actually better then any of the other buffets station owns. But I still have Bacchanal @ Caesars as my top 1. I 

During my visit @ 12:16. They were testing the fire alarms every 2 minutes. The staff in the buffet said it's standard while they are renovating the whole resort"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch!!! No hassle parking. AYCE is only less than a month old everything is new. Our server Glenda is friendly, courtesy and amazing attentive! Thank you for an excellent brunch experience! Food selection had something for everyone!..."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my dad one day as we had received a BOGO coupon offer in the mail. Since Palm's was recently acquired by Station Casinos, their players card is now the \"Boarding Pass\" system. (great ! cuz i never had palm's lol). At $23.80 w/ coupon for 2 people, eh why not try it out, right? 

The A.Y.C.E. buffet is a newly renovated buffet that Palm's had done in the recent few months. My friend had came here for Brunch soon after our vacay in December and said the food was really good. Since then, been mildly wanting to try this place. 

Like most buffets, there are separate sections. 

Sweet & Light (Dessert) - pistachio and cappuccino gelato. both were nice. cappuccino had a decent amount of coffee flavor. there was this cafe latte pudding thing there too. Surprisingly, flavor-wise, it was like a cafe latte, without sugar (like how i'd order from a coffee shop). strong coffee flavor. borderline bitter for a dessert. LOL maybe they forgot the sugar. xD 

Smoke & Fire (BBQ) - Tried pork ribs and brisket. Pork ribs were super dry and hard to eat. Brisket was nicely flavored with a good bite, and a nice amount of smokiness. Not overly fatty but at this point, was full already. Lol i saw they had turkey legs but looked really dry. 

The Hearth (Italian) - Pizzas... made to order pasta station...? Pizzas/calzones/etc looked horrible so i didn't touch any of this. And the made-to-order pasta station was unmanned for half the meal. When there was someone, they were behind on orders. 

Somewhere in between here had a small \"bucket\" that has a crawfish overhanging the side with clams, mussels, shrimp in a light broth. Everything in this was overcooked. Full of broken shells and empty shells. I didn't find a single piece of clam despite having like 4 empty clams Lol... Shrimp was small, similar to the one offered in shrimp cocktail

The Roastery (Carving Station) - Surprisingly, the roast beef/prime rib was really well cooked and tender. They have a roasted cauliflower here too. Totally forgot to get it after being surprised at the thick cut of prime rib the carver gave me. Lol Add some sour cream w/ some horseradish, and some au jus to the prime rib and you're golden. The have elote (mexican street corn on a cob) in 3 different ways. Hot cheeto? dorito?, normal, and something else. Small portions poked with a skewer. The corn surprisingly is cooked well and not super soft, like most buffets. 

World Pan (Asian) - Of all things, surprisingly the honey walnut shrimp was good. Lol. The shrimp was nicely cooked and had a nice firm bite. Sauce was nice and creamy. 

I think there was one more section but i forgot to look at it Lol 

Oh the soup and salad station in the middle, right in front of the entrance had a few soups, fruits, and salad. As well as ceviche and shrimp cocktail, peeled and in individual serving containers. 

During or rather near end of my meal, i had realized what this buffet had reminded me of. Red Rock Casinos buffet. Then again, it is now the same company so not that surprising. Also, with a mild hint of Cosmopolitan with their individual plating, cute but mildly annoying at the same time Lol.. They had a lot of \"mislabeled\" stuff. I dont remember exactly example of things but it wasn't what was labeled. 

For the price i paid, and a full meal, without any \"after meal complications\", it wasn't bad. But even at the price i paid, i'm not that sure if i'd return again. Not much seafood options. With the options they had, really small and overcooked. \"Best\" thing they had was probably the roast beef/prime rib. I mean, then again, $12/person w/ bogo offer for prime rib dinner, i guess that works.. 

where was the raclette station some reviews had mentioned? gelato ice cream sandwich? whaaaa ? 

Service was pretty good. Our waitress had our drinks really fast, and new ones even before the previous ones were empty. Plates were cleared before you returned to your table."}
{"text":"This place is great and a real bargain. I am a local and here's the reasons why I like going to Palms and the A.Y.C.E. Buffet. First, there is no fee for parking. That is a HUUGE advantage the Palms has over the other casinos. Second, the casino is about top-notch as any casino on the strip. Third, the best reason to come here is the buffet. I have eaten here a couple of times since it opened. I ate here again today and I loved the service and the good quality of the food. The staff was very nice and the food was very fresh and tasty. I am always satisfied and anyone considering trying this place should look no further. Give it a try. Compared to other casinos on the Strip, with A.Y.C.E., the price is right and food is really great. I will definitely come back here, especially when family and friends visit Las Vegas, I will take them here."}
{"text":"\"All You Can Eat\" housed at the Palms. $11 per person for breakfast. Chosen because there was an asian section. They have a dessert section, typical breakfast food, carved ham, omelet station, asian section and healthy section. Best was the dumplings per the fam. Came around 9:30 and stayed for an hour. Nothing stood out in a good or bad way. Around 10:30 is when the crowd starts to form and there is a line with hotel patrons."}
{"text":"The place was really renovated pretty good compare to the old buffet they had. The food was good for a local casino which is part
Of the station Casino; by far the best buffet among all the station casino. Server was really nice
They will have a small spill introducing the buffet when it was open etc. food selection was really good and the dessert bar. Definitely would be back I hope they do maintain how clean and how the presentation of the food. Price is pretty decent for the food they have in there."}
{"text":"On Feb 26 2018 Kei or Kai a manager there (don't know the correct spelling of her name) discriminated against me by not accommodating my disability.

 I am supposed to be allowed to use the Chairman  line which moves much faster as it serves disabled guests as well ,however she denied me that right and said that I did not look disabled. I was forced to wait in the regular line and when I asked the cashier to call over the head manager she overheard it and became extremely hostile and sarcastically said again\" I told you you don't look  handicapped\". 

Not only did she deny me my right to use a line that's available for disabled people but she discriminated against me because of the way I look, in her mind I did not look disabled. When Edward came over (another manager) to our table I explained to him in detail what happened and he assured me that disabled guests are allowed to use the chairman line as it moves much faster and there is little wait.

 When I asked him why I was not allowed to use it and why she denied me that right he said he didn't have an answer and that he would investigate it and he apologized, I also asked him why would she be allowed to say I did not look disabled and I asked him to explain to me what disabled looks like and he said he did not have an answer. 

Regardless of his apology I find it extremely inappropriate and unprofessional that she was allowed to stay in the buffet and conduct her routine duties after such an incident. I filled out a report of the incident and as of today I have still not heard anything back from anyone there. The ayce buffet at Palms has conducted itself  in an extremely despicable and vile manner as a business . It is clear that they really do not intend to do anything about the Discrimination when they allowed her to stay there after such an incident."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Las Vegas with a reasonable price! There were a variety of food selections from sushi to barbecue to soup to salads and desserts. The food tasted good! Upscale looking decorations and the ambiance was good. The servers were always attentive and smiling. The only item that I did not like was their sushis because the rice was dry and I was able to tell it has been sitting there for a long time, but other than that I am satisfied with my overall experience! I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great buffet to visit if your in Vegas! Price is decent and the customer service is great! The food is also very good!"}
{"text":"My family enjoyed it a lot more than we originally expected. There were some pleasant surprises that most buffets wouldn't have - like asparagus & honey walnut shrimp, which coincidentally were a few of my favorites. I was excited to try their Mexican corn, but was very disappointed. I got the cojita cheese one and it had way too much mayo & cheese, not enough lemon, chili flavor. I think they should change it and let the customers customize and add their own toppings. That would be a hit for sure. 

Overall it was good and we'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Just tried the newly remodeled A.Y.C.E.  I was very impressed with the vegetarianvegan options.  Even though I have been a vegetarian for over 40 years, I had never enjoyed a buffet so much.  There were so many veggie options at the vegan section that my plate was full and I had to make a second run to check out the salad bar and vegan brownies (a perfect dessert).  Gary J."}
{"text":"Great buffet!  We decided to try this buffet due to its recent renovation and mostly great reviews.  We had never visited this buffet prior to the renovation so I can't offer a comparison but I will say i found it quite satisfying.

We got here around 10 am for Sunday brunch and the wait was not too bad. I really liked the decor and cleanliness of this buffet right from the start.  The staff was really attentive and nice and informed us that our brunch included bottomless mimosas yippeee!   

I found that the offerings weren't overwhelmingly endless like in other buffets but the flavor of everything I tried was on point and some of the options were also served individually which I enjoyed.  

The dessert was lacking a bit of creativity and not the most memorable part of this experience so definitely could use some help in this area. 

I would definitely like to come back to compare dinner offerings but overall this was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had to try A.Y.CE. with all the advertising blitz flooding our mailbox! Turns out we were not disappointed at the Lunch Buffet. Food was great, but not much  seafood selections to choose from. The staff was courteous and very helpful. We fed three adults for less than $50 and lunch for three can cost way more at other Buffets around Las Vegas. From a food quality to cost ratio, this is a good deal. We may go back for the Dinner Buffet someday."}
{"text":"I love the new decor and vibe of the restaurant. Some of the tables even have charging stations, which is pretty cool for a buffet. AYCE is definitely worth checking out, but not one of the best buffets in town. 
The good: Unique options for buffet food. The cheesy corn on the cob is yum!  Most dishes have pretty good flavor. 
The not so good: All of the meats that we tried were pretty bland."}
{"text":"This buffet is great, it is owned by the company who has station casinos which means it is reasonably priced (20ish per person). 

Other buffets are so expensive and food quality is so low but here it was not the case. They had salmon, make your own pasta station, the dessert section was incredible! They even had a vegan/ vegetarian section I did not eat it but did see it. 

The portions here are small so you can eat a little bit of everything. I like the small portions because there is less food waste and more space to try foods. 

I really enjoyed their desserts- macaroons, cheesecake, ice cream, cookies so many things and most made in house. 

I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Premium food at a reasonable price. Food was fresh and the service attentive. Great selection. An upgrade over The Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"Fantastic near the strip buffet  without their high prices.  Great quality food and amazing selections unlike most Stations casinos which Palms is a property  of."}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas, and decided to try the A.Y.C.E. Buffet today for lunch at the Palms. It started out great by having a line for seniors and disabled people. I am both.  I loved that. The food, not so much! I found the food to be oversalted, under or overcooked, way to spicy or just bland. In the kitchen, they pay a lot of attention to quantity, but not so much for quality.
I am a vegetarian, and they had a few ok choices, but I wonder how the head chef or sous chef can let the food go out without tasting or checking it. It ran me almost $17 for lunch. Bottom line, I can do much better at home. My kitchen and my food beats it hands down."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner tonight. I gave it 2 stars for the nice decor on the wall, very clean establishment, and the service. The food was a different story--I was let down by the choices they had to offer(no sushi area or seafood area) and the appearance of some of the items didn't seem appealing. Most of the hot food items weren't hot in terms of temperature. Their only saving grace for me was their Honey Walnut Shrimp and Ahi Poke bowl and the Desserts weren't too bad. 
Honestly I've been to better buffets for a cheaper price. I left the buffet disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends to celebrate a birthday. We went around 5:30PM, so there was barely a wait or many patrons. Service was attentive enough--no complaints there.

But the food. There is no seafood, which is understandable for the price you're paying for. There is a smattering of smaller prepared seafood dishes like a pail of shrimp cocktail, small small small dishes of poke, and cooked fish. The shrimps were super tiny and reminiscent of the ones you get in the freezer section that you can stir fry. It didn't taste fresh. The poke bowls barely had any taste to them. Bottom line, stay away from most of the seafood. The cod with lemon and capers was not bad though. There is a decent assortment of meats, but most of us felt that they were too dry. I think there was a general consensus that the food was dry because the turnover rate isn't as fast as those buffets on the strip. I think my favorite dish of the night was the wedge salad lol.

I think for the price, the food quality was fair. Would I come here on my own volition? Probably not. I think it's a good option for groups though since there is a decent variety."}
{"text":"Not bad the new Palms buffet is better then what it was still not the best but good has stuf on the menu for vegetarians now I thought that was good ."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Charges full amount for kids (no matter how old). Not much selection. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, waited for over 30 minutes, no waiting area, and the lady named Nancy said we are blocking the way,   The reason why we are standing anyway is we are waiting to be seated, and your telling me we are blocking the way, then get  our table ready already!!! , It's my son's birthday and everybody is upset of the bad service we got, not coming back there anymore for sure! Attention to the management, please, train your employees properly. It's customer service business. They should be friendly, nice and with manners."}
{"text":"The food was good for the price point but where are the elotes I thought this buffet was known for??!! When I went, there were only plain corns and I was super sad... 
My favorite was the roast beef from carving station and french onion soup.
Try little bit of everything and just stick with the things that tasted fresh and good. And remember that this isn't a $50 buffet!"}
{"text":"I tried the A.Y.C.E. Buffet at the Palms Casino for lunch based on the over 200 positive reviews on Yelp. The establishment is clean and spacious with tables placed far apart. There are seven different stations serving everything from healthy and vegetarian dishes to Asian to Roasted Meats to Barbecue to Desserts.

For the price it I absolutely a great value. There were a lot of choices but not as many as you might find at some other buffets but the quality of every single item that I tasted was stellar!

I tried some potstickers and spring rolls. Salt and pepper chicken wings which were fantastic. A bowl of clam chowder. Poke salad which was as good as I have found anywhere. Since I read that the pizza at the buffet was fantastic I tried a small slice and once again it was great pizza with a great crust and great cheese and toppings.

There were many other items but I didn't want to overeat and I will be back for dinner soon to try additional items. There is very little seafood (I saw some Thai Curried Mussels, but there are many other choices. I was disappointed in the Barbecue station because there was not one beef item.

The salad choices are extensive and the fruit was fantastic. The watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew melon that I tried were great. The only thing I tried at the dessert station which was truly extensive was some pistachio gelato and that was as good as it gets as well.

The service was fast and the dishes were cleared quickly. Great value at a great price."}
{"text":"I researched on Yelp quite a bit before settling on this buffet.  I had heard it fashioned itself after Wicked Spoon in a lot of its presentation style but didn't kick you in the guts in terms of price.  As long as you register for a players card through the hotel, there is a nominal discount, but even without, the prices are decent at all times of the day. 

For us, there was no line for dinner, and the cashier, hostesses, and server were all pleasant. We were sat in a central area which wasn't too loud or crowded and kept us close enough that the food wasn't a hike away from the table. So far so good. 

The food was just good. It was definitely nothing to write home to grandma about. There were some highlights for me though. The wedge salad was a nice fresh starter. My only complaint was the light amount of dressing.  The fingerling potatoes were delicious. They had a hearty amount of vegetarian dishes which I thought was great.  I really enjoyed the Asian fare, as did my husband. We brought my stepson, who is 14 here and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm pretty sure he cleaned at least four plates full of food and he is a finicky eater.  All in all, for us, as a family of four that didn't want to break the bank but wanted to try a nice buffet, we were absolutely satisfied. I would come again."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly flush with self-control when it comes to food, so I usually avoid buffets. But a friend had a BOGO coupon for this one, and I also hate passing up a good deal. So we came for Friday night dinner.

Station recently took over the Palms and their renovations immediately focused on the dining options, and this buffet is a huge upgrade from the previous one under Maloof ownership. Space is brighter and more appealing, food is fresher with more variety, and we were pleasantly surprised by the overall increase in quality.

PROS: Several vegetarian and vegan options, including roasted cauliflower steaks at the carving station and jackfruit enchiladas! Their brisket at the BBQ station was on point. Good mix of trendy dishes like Doritos elote and mini poke bowls along with classic buffet staples like prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and a made to order pasta station. $18/adult with players card seemed about right. 

CONS: More than a couple of dishes were mislabeled (\"mashed potatoes\" were actually sweet potatoes until they were switched out, second \"brisket\" tray actually appeared to be liver and onions, \"coffee\" flavored dessert was actually caramel, etc) and despite the focus on freshness and healthy options, the greens at the salad bar were past their prime and more than half of that area needed to be restocked. Service was polite but our drinks stayed empty after our first refill, despite us lingering an extra half hour. 

It seems they change up their offerings regularly, I'll be back to catch the raclette station, mussel curry, and gelato ice cream cookie sandwiches."}
{"text":"During our stay at The Palms we had breakfast two days at AYCE, and my husband and I loved it. There were so many choices, and they even have vegetarian and vegan options!
Our second morning we went to have breakfast we did get there a little later, they swap out to the lunch menu at 11am so we didn't get as much breakfast as the day before. But! The lunch menu was amazing as well! Again, there were also a lot of vegetarian and vegan options.
All of the food was so good, and the servers that bring you your drinks are very kind as well."}
{"text":"We went here on a week night for dinner. There was no line & not crowded at all but it did take them a good 10-15 min to set up our table (4 adults & 2 highchairs). We had our players cards so dinner was $2 off normal price. At first glance the place looks amazing. Definitely a huge upgrade from the previous buffet. The hotel is really closed off because of the remodel but the cafe & buffet are completely redone. They did have the new smaller high chairs and everything was very clean. 

When we were seated our server immediately greeted us, took our drink orders and gave us a run down of the food stations. The concept is great but I felt like they were trying to make the buffet more tapas style but the quality of the food was not that great. The food was sitting out too long under the heaters bc most of the food was dry and the meats were over cooked and tough. 

The foods that were delicious and being eaten and replenished often were great (walnut shrimp, carved turkey, fresh fruit, and Mac and cheese) But everything just sat there. 

This would be last choice for a station casino buffet. Maybe if they fine tune their menu and have fresher prepared food it could be a great buffet. 

The staff was super friendly and very attentive. And they have \"cleaners\" coming around sweeping up the floors."}
{"text":"A.Y.C.E, short for \"all you can eat\" opened up a little over a week ago on the ground floor of the Palms hotel.

After eating here last night, here's my top 5 things to know about Las Vegas' newest buffet:

1. Corn on the cob three ways! They brushed grilled corn with mayo and rolled it in crushed Doritos, Flaming Hot Cheetoes, and Cojita Cheese. It is soooo good I ate 4!!!
2. New to the buffet scene, they serve Thai Penang pork and Korean Kalbi beef ribs.  
3. They catered to both ends of the spectrum. As a vegetarian I was happy to find healthy light vegetarian dishes like tofu lettuce wraps as well as mushroom quesadillas and my husband who loves his meat found loads of southern BBQ beef. 
4. With a Station Casinos player's card you get a discount at the door.  Also, Station mails out 2-for-1 buffet coupons about every month when you sign up for a player's card. They apply here.
5.  Look for the Cinnamon-sugar coated taco shells at the dessert station! Yummy!!

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and at less than $20/person including tip (without a 2-for-1 coupon) it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast!  The Eggs were perfect.  Lots of selection. Starting from fresh juice, to vegetarian dishes, to best omelette station. Great price for the quality. Everthing was fresh and great. Highy Recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and every experience has been flawless. Food is innovative and different from what you'd see at other buffets. Elotes, French onion soup, smoked brisket and 3 different types of mac n cheese!! All to die for.  Love that they have a healthy vegetarian station called \"Revival\". Line is long because people love it... worth the wait for sure. 
I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. At the beginning of the line seemed normal but within five minutes it seem like we're getting backed up.  They didn't have it quite organized for the seating as both lines were complaining about the wait.
When we first approach the food and the sign is the not match the food but I noticed the lady trying to fix them. Maybe we got there st sign changing time. Had a variety but cramped in dining area. Our waitress Ebony was most helpful."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet was surprisingly good. They don't have a very big selection like some other buffets but, from what they do have, it is very good. We happen to come at a time when they're switching from breakfast to lunch so we had a small taste of lunch as well and from little we tried, it was good too. Will definitely come back for dinner buffet (another day cause we're FULL haha). One more thing, service was great thanks to Will, friendly staff. I hope they don't change."}
{"text":"This is the newest addition to the Las Vegas buffet scene, and it did not disappoint.

It may be out of the way for types that like to stick to the strip, but the Palms is a fun excursion and the buffet is an added bonus. I really don't remember anything about the previous buffet, and I'm something of a Vegas buffet connoisseur, so that's definitely a sign it needed an upgrade.

I came for lunch and the wait in line wasn't terrible, about average for that time of day. The thing that attracted me was the price, its an amazing value for what you get and especially compared to some others around. 

The inside is beautiful, open, and bright.  Its easy to navigate, and not overwhelming.  Our waitress was attentive and it seems to be fully staffed.

One thing I love about this buffet that set it apart are all the little dishes. Instead of just scooping out heaps of food on a spoon, they make up these little bowls and plates, almost tapas style. Not only does it help control how much food you get, it just seems a lot less messy and more quaint. 

That said, everything was good! The sliders were amazing, and they have an entire section for vegetarian/alternative options that wasn't just a salad bar (I think this is the first time I've seen this at a Vegas buffet?) 

I'm very interested to come back for dinner, considering how good lunch was. I certainly think its worth the hike off the strip."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. Everything that I brought to the table was cold. ( mashed potatoes, cauliflower, fish, veggies and potatoes) . Not much choices of anything. Last buffet had more selections and better food. Not much to choose from desserts unless you are cupcake lover. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This buffet is up among the Buffets in Vegas. The most value is for the price of a regular buffet you get food that can compare to a fine dinning restaurant. Some of my favorites are the duck cassoulet, walnut shrimp,  brisket, and of course for a chicken wing man, the salt and pepper chicken wing. Lots more to mention but my most favorite of all is the pressed fruit drink in a shot glass which is a must. You get the food value and the ambience for the price of a hole in the wall buffet. Special mention are the staff who made our dinning experience every better."}
{"text":"There were enough vegetarian options to make the A.Y.C.E. Buffet interesting. The jackfruit enchiladas were very good. I also enjoyed the hummus, baba ganoush, and eggplant salad.  Skip the dry pita bread. The buffalo mac and cheese was gross, but the traditional version was good. They offer three variations of a few of their dishes, including corn on the cob.

They have a \"Raclette\" station where cheese is melted on small griddles and then poured on top of dishes of sautéed veggies, potatoes, and pasta. I saw slices of orange cheese and white cheese being used, likely something other than raclette, but I'm not sure what kind. If you like watching cheese melt, check this out.

The cinnamon roll bread pudding was the stand-out dessert item. The assorted macarons including pistachio, coffee, chocolate, lemon, and raspberry, tasted fresh, unlike the dry macarons at other high-end buffets.

For the price, under $20, it's definitely five stars. They don't appear to offer crab legs, which seems to keep the entrance line short, and that's also worth five stars. Parking is still free at the Palms. I don't like any other Stations Casino Feast Buffet, but this one is good because it's brand new."}
{"text":"This was the long awaited, recently opened buffet at the Palms. If you've been to the old Palms buffet (Bistro Buffet) you already know any resemblance to the old space has been gutted, reinvented and given a face lift - R.I.P. the all you can drink beer & wine that used to be included free with dinner..

Out with the old in with the new right?- Well after my visit i am convinced that the wait was well worth it. Station Casinos have this old habit of making all their buffets painfully similar, but not this time! Palms buffet is a gem of its own. I found the food to be presented very nicely, saw a selection of items not usually found at your typical Vegas buffet, and found the atmosphere to be quite inviting. 

Usually i'd be listing off specific items i enjoyed the most to members of the Yelposphere, but since this is newly introduced venue I wanted to leave some of the excitement  and curiosity intact. Kind of like a newly released movie you don't want to reveal ALL the details to. Go check it out! I've given you the ever so important assurance that my experience was a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The best buffet I been to in vegas. HANDS DOWN!
From beef short rib to creme brulee, they got it all. Top notch service"}
{"text":"This buffet started with a brand new menu in December. I've just started going here less than a month ago. Today, I used my points and along with my players card, I didn't have to pay a dollar. This is probably my fourth time this month. 

Josefina was my server today. I also spoke with Facia, the manager who was very open and friendly. We discussed desserts and she gave me suggestions that I followed. Cool vibe here and it shows with the food style, which is fresh and vibrant. I hope that they keep this place upbeat and change the menu occasionally. Not that it's bad but I eat here so much, I don't want to get tired of it. 

Originally, I gave a 4 star review but this place is consistently good and for a buffet, that's impressive.

Everyone has been very cordial and friendly which is nice. Other buffets can be rude and push people through like cattle. Not here. And, the food is always replaced promptly so rarely is there an empty tray."}
{"text":"The Palms' \"From Dust to Gold\" slogan is quite accurate, the Stations' $260 mil renovation of the Palms is beautiful eye candy ..construction is still going on in the east side of the property ..looks like the exec offices are totally gone due to the renovation.

The A.Y.C.E. buffet is pretty but greatly lacking compared to other buffets in town...they've got a long way to go to catch up. Here for dinner on a Wednesday..the selections are very limited, most are not kept warm or hot...an apple pie was offered for dessert amongst many pre-made cookies; very little food is being 'made' here, moreso being unpacked, warmed and put on display. 

The buffet needs MAJOR improvements!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This is by far the best buffettin Las Vegas and worth every penny.

What I love about this buffett and what makes it different are the pre-set portions, which you can always go back for more. This is such a huge advantage because it gives the cutest presentation and keeps everything fresh.

The assortment is very different than most lamb, civiche, premium shrimp cocktail, ribs and seafood boil soup. But the most impressive thing was the desert selection, all small petite offerings to allow you to try more flavors. 

The whole buffett was very clean, very fresh and hand crafted. Way to step up the bar!!"}
{"text":"Reopened on the 12/22/17,  after months of renovations. Food menus have been revamped, ambiance is good and service is impeccable. Our waiter had worked as food service for decades! Tip: get in early to avoid the crowds and long wait lines. But if you don't it's still worth the wait.kid friendly and good for large family and friend groups. Can't wait until next month's visit."}
{"text":"Located in the Palms Casino the A.Y.C.E. Buffet is the newest casino buffet to open in Vegas. Compared to the last casino buffet to open, the Medley at the Orleans, A.Y.C.E. Buffet is way way better. I think it's even cheaper when using the player's card. They were about $20 for dinner.

Where do I start!? How about the last thing I had!? The desserts. They actually have a nice selection of some really good desserts. I probably had one of everything at least once. The Creme Brulee they served was the best I've had in a while. The custard mixture was rich and very tasty. It tasted like more egg yolks were used which I preferred. The chocolate mousse cake was also delicious. I had like 5 of them. They're small pieces. There's gelato, macarons, cookies, sugar-free things, and more. 

I honestly ate a little of almost everything except whatever was in the station on the far left.  I'll just mention a few of the items I really enjoyed. Everything in the salad area especially wedge salad. The chicken pot pie, turkey legs, BBQ briskets and rib, kalbi, corn on the cob, pizza, duck, mussels, salmon, walnut shrimp, and everything else. I was easily there for a few hours.

I did like how there were a lot of dishes served in small plates or containers. They're nice to have because it keeps dishes separate from other dishes. 

The only knock on them is there wasn't a made to order pasta station or crab legs but I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing . The dishes alone are outstanding. The service is amazing . Everybody is nice from the hostess to the cooks !!!! Definitely a must"}
{"text":"Came here to have breakfast but was late since they switch from breakfast to lunch 20 to 30 minutes before the time changes. So  definitely get there early cause there was a big line! We were already at the cashier during breakfast time so we got to pay that price instead of lunch!!!! We waited about 20 mins to be seated and the waiter who helped us, a young man was super nice. It was clean and had a modern look to it. I think most of the food was pretty darn good. Im not in to buffet cause its hit or miss on certain food items. But i enjoyed most of them from what i remember i liked the  cheedar mac and cheese ,  Fried rice, Pot stickers ,  Corn bread ,soup and pizza. I never been to a buffet that had a ice cream bar i was amazed and excited LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed in main courses, after seeing such high reviews. Korean ribs were very tough, chewy, and full of gristle. Brisket was tender, but had an odd, artificial smoke flavor. Ribs, however, were very good, and all of the desserts I tried (and I tried alot!) were excellent. The creme brulee was especially good."}
{"text":"For the price, this is a pretty good buffet in Vegas right now. I mean...I like the Wynn, Bellagio, and Cosmo buffets...but they are overpriced for someone who can't really eat large quantities of food. The new Palms buffet on the other hand is both economical and delicious. Maybe because it's still new, they are pumping out high quality, flavorful food. We plan on eating here weekly as long as they keep up the awesome cooking."}
{"text":"It's a great experience for food, and alright experience on staff. This place is pretty brand new, they do lots of commercials on TVs and YouTubes, that's what makes me here.

Price: $22 with station casino player card on Sunday night.

Environment: it's a good place to hangout with your friends and family, pretty casual dining place. 

Staff: the host lady was so nice, she was doing amazing job. During the time she lead me to my seat, she introduced me that they had seven food sections and her recommendations for the day would be French onion soup, which tasted pretty nice.
The waitress was different story, I understand as an buffet restaurant staffs are always busy, but through out the entire time I sit there, she didn't refill my water and drink even once. And she even purposely avoid her customers when the table next to me was looking her. Big disappointment!

Food: 
They had seven food sections.
I recommend the orange chicken and Panang curry, they fried chicken pretty well, and the sauce and the seasoning was on point. The panang curry was flavorful, the beef inside were super tender.

I also recommend the BBQ items on smoke section, almost every meat items here were so tender and juicy, that really surprised me. Even the steak here is tender and juicy, it not chewy or rubbery.

Dessert:
The do have variety of dessert choices. They even served macaroons, cream puffs, and cream brûlées. However, the taste of those isn't surprised me as much as the BBQ items.

Overall, the food quality was not bad, but it doesn't worth $22 for sure. Waitresses need serious training. I wish yelp would let me put 3.5 stars, that's how I truly feel about this place."}
{"text":"Love the  vegan options high quality for the price. Clean and fun ambience. I only tried the brunch buffet worth coming back for the price"}
{"text":"This review is more for those who already are familiar with buffets in Las Vegas. 

I decided to go here on the suggestions from Yelp reviewers.  I was not disappointed.  It offers a plethora of great options like other buffets at higher prices.  The Asian/Italian/Mexican/Seafood/American food sections are on par with other buffets in Las Vegas.  It's price after you get the \"Boarding Pass\" is very reasonable - at the base level a dinner goes from 21 to 19 dollars.

It isn't on the status of the Bacchanal buffet, but it is also much more reasonable and family friendly.

I took my son for his birthday and he was quite happy, and he is a finicky eater.  The pasta dishes, the southern food options, and the Asian options were as good as any other restaurant that solely serves those types of dishes.  

At the end - the variety, price, and value for a family is amazing for this newer buffet.  I will certainly return to this one."}
{"text":"This might be the best buffet in town.

I've never been to the old Palms buffet, but hearing that it was going to be remodeled and taken over by Station Casinos, I knew I'd have to give it a try. Given that I knew Red Rock Hotel and Sunset Hotel had good buffets, I had high hopes and this buffet surpassed those expectations.

The variety of food you can choose from is crazy. They've got the best and deepest variety of of food of any Station Casino Buffet and also a few other hotels on the strip. The food itself all looks, smells and tastes great. 

Service is good too. When we came in, we had Patrica and she was excellent. She was incredible friendly and made a lot of fun conversation. She also was very fast with refilling drinks and collecting dirty plates from the table.

Overall this buffet is fantastic, and is up there as one of the best in town."}
{"text":"This buffet is new, beautiful, and extremely well priced! There is many different stations including a vegan/vegetarian station which is something I have not seen in any other buffet. The food was always fresh and taste is a 10. The price is probably half of what all the buffets in the strip cost. If you are looking for a fun buffet you should come in and try it."}
{"text":"Weeknight dinner is a STEAL! We paid less than $30/person. Most of the food was good, the bbq meats were a little tough. Everything is portioned in small containers so you don't get too much!"}
{"text":"By far the best buffet in the red rock resorts family. Vegans rejoice the revival section of the buffet has everything you could want and more. No longer just meats and a salad bar. A Y C E has a little bit of everything you could want. Price is spot on and service keeps my drink full and the table clean."}
{"text":"I would give this a solid four stars or maybe a little higher. Service is the best of any of the buffet. They clean your plates in a timely fashion compared to the studio B or other station casinos. The smoke and fire section has really good ribs But the brisket was nothing to write home about.  Shrimp cocktail, other shrimp dishes, the seafood boil, and some others I can't think of right now were really good.  Duck was extremely dry.  The desserts were amazing and the poke was different than any I ever had but still good.  Overall solid for 18 a person on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was not the greatest. Some of the food was cold and deserts weren't the best . Would not recommend. Don't believe me ... go ahead and try."}
{"text":"Perfect. The Palms really got this one right. The design and feel of the place is upscale and rivals that of the Aria buffet, with a price that's about half of what you'd pay there.

All of the food was hot (this was at 3 p.m. on a Wednesday) which is a huge win as most Vegas buffets are hit or miss in this department, especially during non-peak times. 

The selection was great and a bit more unique than the standard Vegas buffet selection, which kept things interesting. Everything tasted great and the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. 

This will easily be my go-to buffet in Vegas."}
{"text":"Price: pretty affordable compared to other buffets on the strip that cost around $30-40.  The dinner here is around $20 (without their \"boarding pass\" card)

This buffet is better than similarly priced \"cheap\" buffets I've been to (like circus circus), because it's super new (opened in Dec 2017) and the food is better than I expected for $20.  The main thing difference from fancier buffets would probably just be less seafood (they have shrimp and cooked fish options, but no crab legs and not much sushi).  I like the small portioned plates - they make the food look more attractive and (hopefully) help reduce food waste.  Most notably, it was cool that they had \"trendy\" foods like poke (tasted meh), and ELOTE!!  I was extremely happy that they had elote, and not only that, they had THREE kinds of elote! (including cheeto-covered, which I didn't try but I thought was pretty trendy of them). 
Cons: The \"ice cream\"/\"gelato\" (the one they scoop, not the one from the machine) was really bad. It tasted really weird with that medicine sweet taste.

Overall, quite a good value and nice place for $20."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Huge selection of food, including a ton of vegetarian items and a vegan station. Lots of items in ramekins or individual bowls, easy to grab and try different dishes. 8 different ice creams at dessert station along with cakes and French macarons. And it's a pretty affordable buffet at ~$22. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I'm went here because somebody suggested me to go here and mentioned it was a new place. I like the fact that it's new and clean. We went here with 3 people. Two adults and one 4 year old child. The price waa 17.99$ they even charge my daughter full price which I thought was not right my daughter does not eat as much as a grown up and for them to charge full price wasnt correct. The food was whatever it wasn't all that. Very bland. The m casino is better."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I understand they just remodeled and have been serving for less then one month but the food was below standard.  
Turkey legs were cold and dry, asparagus and Brussels sprouts were very uncooked, pulled pork was extremely fatty, roast beef was ok and the helpings for the shrimp cocktails and  crawfish were very very small.  Does the chef taste the food before serving???? Obviously not.   
To top that off the salad bar reach was almost impossible to get some of the items I wanted to add to my salad.  If you want to try the soup ( which was good) the way they have it set up makes it very difficult to serve yourself.  Opening the cover to get the soup was a pain.  You think having remodel the place they would make it easy for the customers to get to the selections.   

The one thing I liked was the staff.  They were polite and very helpful.   They too were getting ears full of customers complaining.  

Too bad... thumbs down for the Palms Buffett.   Not ever returning.   :("}
{"text":"What's the hype to this? They may have had something going for them four months ago but I wasn't impressed when I went here mid April for a weekday dinner ($17.99).

I did not see any of the individual juice bottles that have been posted here. Plus I thought there were going to be a bigger selection. The buffet was smaller than I thought and the food wasn't too fresh and it took awhile for items to be replenished.  As a local, I would much rather go to the M Buffet instead. A weekday dinner is actually around the same price as this buffet.

Hopefully they will revamp and add more selections as time goes on. But I came, I saw, I tried and unfortunately won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The last time I came here was before it went through remodeling wow what changes! Usually when a place does remodeling they start putting the price on the patrons and decreasing the food quality I'm always scared and skeptical whenever something is closed for renovations. In this case The upgrade not only brought better food service quality and at the same affordable price, with a players card of course-so you know you need to sign up for it! 
Breakfast: $8.99
Lunch: $12.99
Dinner: $17.99

These are prices with the players card you swear I wouldn't know what the regular prices are! Doesn't matter because I'm not willing to spend an extra two dollars more just get the card! :p"}
{"text":"In terms of price and value, A.Y.C.E. buffet at Palms is unbeatable! I came for the champagne Sunday brunch, which is $22 and includes bottomless mimosas. Ohh yeah.

Some selections here may not seem too great or appetizing, but here's the kicker - you don't have to eat those! The brunch buffet offers plenty of different options of breakfast foods interspersed with the more savory foods. 

The layout of the food type is not straightforward, so I'd suggest doing a lap to check everything out to get your bearings as the section names are confusing. Lemme tell you - I went to town on those mashed potatoes and prime rib. And mimosas. 

P.S. the cinnamon bread pudding is DELISH, esp topped with vanilla ice cream! Must get!"}
{"text":"Advertise major remodel but value & food quality take a major nose dive from former Palms Bistro Buffet. No real seafood, just bland."}
{"text":"I came with about 12 of my coworkers. We were seated right away! Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the variety of food stationed offered. From Asian, to BBQ, Italian, a great salad bar and dessert bar etc. The food was fresh, hot and very tasty. I will definitely be coming back in the near future! :)"}
{"text":"For the last few years, we have visited Vegas lots.  This is the only buffet we go to.

We have been to many over the years, but why go elsewhere when this buffet keeps us happy.  And the price is much cheaper than other buffets that are not as good as this one.  Our family of four has dinner here for $90.  We could spend $120-$150 at other places, but why.

The new decor is nice and has upgraded the overall look.

This visit we really liked; the poke bowls, great carvery selections, freshest ingredients when building our own soft tacos.  The ice cream was top notch.  Quality."}
{"text":"Great selection of food, good quality and fresh, great value. 
All of the staff was friendly and outgoing, excellent for a Vegas buffet, highly recommend."}
{"text":"So unfortunately I was quite disappointed with this revamped Palms Buffet! Don't get me wrong it does look better but the selection was quite lackluster. Each section only had a few items in it. It seems like they are trying to be more like wicked spoon with individual servings vs scoop out however much you want.  I went for Sunday Brunch. My favorite items were the French onion soup and apple juice! How sad is that? Not sure I'll be coming here again...."}
{"text":"The buffet was real good. The price was reasonable compared to the buffets around that we're about $33 dollars and up. This buffet set me back $21.99 for a Saturday night. The buffet line had a  good selection of food from BBQ, Sushi, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican.  Anytime they have elotes on a stick in the buffet line that earns an extra star. Good selection of desserts with an ice cream bar were you can make your own ice cream sandwich. The quality of the food was exceptional. The gourmet food was made by professionals. I highly recommend this buffet for dinner and I will return to  the the palms buffet on my next visit."}
{"text":"YEAH !!!! Beautifully renovated, my type of decor (nicer than Orleans and food is WAAAYYYY BETTER) 

I've always love mini dishes at buffets and they have it which is wonderful.. just like all the strip buffets..

The food is GOOD except for the dessert  section, nothing special (it's a good thing for me cuz I'm a sweet lover) hehe!!

My favorites are the pork slice up on the cutting board(very tender), Asian chicken wings was crispy and flavorful, the Mexican has to be pork pastor(not a typical taco pastor type but was very yummy  

I know there isn't a lot of different dishes to choose from but the quality is more important..

Presentation on all the foods was beautifully made, but some lack in flavors like shepherds , veggie pot pie and burgers ..

They have a vegan section, I didn't try it cuz nothing look appealing ..  Overall I would definitely come back again and again until the food quality changes(gets worst) this goes for all the buffets I've been to."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the new A.Y.C.E. buffet. The smoked meat choices were my favorite. Very nice healthier choices than your average buffet. But do not over look the wide deliciousness of their desserts. We will definitely be back to dine on our next stay at the Palms."}
{"text":"One \"word\": Wow!. This is a new buffet, opened this January (at least that's what I found online, must be true)... The lunch cost per person was $17 (? $18). The place looks clean, and the service was really good. But of course the main thing was the food, I'm gonna be honest here, this is the best buffet I've ever tried.

The food was well done and good quality, the steak, pulled pork and elotes were amazing, not even joking. Believe me, if you're in Las Vegas, and want to eat 'till you can't move at some buffet, go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food was great (all three of us really enjoyed it), but the service was SO SLOW!! We were there last Friday, for the first time, and waited for over an hour in line just to be seated (and the line was not even long when we got in it)! The cashier said that the wait was due to busy tables but so many tables were empty in clear view from where we were standing in the line. Meanwhile, there were about 3-4 girls at a time just standing by the register... One ringing people up, the others just chatting to each other while \"holding the line.\" If the few waiters on the floor were busy, why didn't these girls help with clearing tables, refilling drinks to move things along? Anyway, once we were finally seated, our waitress was kind, but messed up our original drink order and then didn't even come by to refill our drinks until we had already been seated for about an hour. Because the food was really good, I'd consider going there again IF THE LINE IS MOVING AT A REASONABLE PACE."}
{"text":"Palms is under renovation and one of the newest changes is the new A.Y.C.E buffet. I decided to check it out for lunch and I was impressed. It had a good selection of small dishes, bbq, pasta, fish you name it. The food quality was easily on par with Red Rock and other buffet's in it's price tag actually I would say it was a bit better. Some of the various dishes I tried were the Swiss mac n cheese, a few slices of the fresh pork that was SUPER good, a little dish of cucumbers in some sort of dressing. I can't actually recall everything I ate but I can say I went up for seconds on the fresh cut pork. Seating was nice and the customer service was all you can ask for for attentive on drinks and making sure you were happy. The place has a bit of a Western cowboy feel to it. I think this is a safe bet to get lunch or dinner give it a shot. Stations has def come through good on this change at the Palms."}
{"text":"I am torn with this New Buffet (fully remodeled room and food stations)
Did you know the Palm Casino is now a Station Casino? I didn't know...
Yesterday night they had macarons!!! 
A.Y.C.E. buffet reminds me of the one in Red Rock Hotel, just smaller. They opened end of december of 2017 so not long ago. You would expect the food quality to be outstanding for at least 6 months (right?)
Also Salad's lover, A.y.c.e. doesn't offer a large salad bar selection as Red Rock Casino...
Before I talk about my experience let say that when you pay less than$20 for dinner you should not complain right? 
Let's be fair and honest, it's was good.
Also go sign up for a Casino Players card (takes 2mns) it gives you some discount when you pay :)
Choice is decent, what bothered me was that individual serving were close to cold, and stations were not filled appropriately for dinner rush
I read some many people writing about the macarons they saw on TV ads and not at the buffet... i might be lucky... it was plenty of them at the dessert station hehehe!
The host took us to our table. Nice and friendly. Our waiter offered us great service.  
most of their dishes are displayed in individual portion. which is smart, less waste!
Frenchy clin d'il with some traditional french dish like Coq au Vin, Cassoulet à la cuisse de canard, soupe à l oignon :)
The soupe à l oignon was delicious, enjoyed the melted cheese!
The cassoulet was alright, i believe it was displayed for some time, the canard/duck was dry and cold :( the beans were almost perfect
The coq au vin was delicious and tasty! translated in english is like Roaster cooked in wine.
picked a salmon poke. The rice was hard :( 

the funny part is when I look at the salad bar. They offer individual portions of shrimp cocktail, ceviche (lemon doesn't look fresh, it's dried :(()
Like i said compare to the Red Rock salad bar... the bar did not offer many choices.
so here is the funny.. couple clients were looking for butter... nowhere to be found by the sliced bread.
A man was feeling his bowl of \"mozzarella mini balls\" till the station attendant said \"Sir, are you a butter lover?\" it was hilarious, I was giggling so hard !!! 
so the butter is rolled into small balls like mozzarella ... and placed next to each other... so don't get tricked ah ah ah
Pizza/Italian station offers pizza, pasta, calzone pizza...
Dessert station is small but offers good variety of ice cream and pastries. 
Like the macarons and the vanilla puffs!"}
{"text":"A.Y.C.E. [all you can eat] Buffet at the Palms Casino, is not a very original name, nor would I recommend this buffet to anyone.  I've always believed the taste of food is more important than it's appearance or the restaurant's decor.  I've eaten breakfasts, lunches, & dinners at A.Y.C.E. Buffet.  Many of the selections are ultra fancy, small portions of unusual concoctions that look better than they taste.  In fact, most of the food is often too dry, too overcooked or undercooked, and tasteless.  My wife agrees with me and we will never eat there again.

The buffet, when the Palms was operated by the Maloof family, offered better tasting food, more variety, and a larger selection of food items, especially meats, salads, and deserts."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had lunch much here. We are staying at palms place so it was convenient. They have a descent selection with a few varieties of food available. A small vegan section,an Asian inspired area,some classics like Pizza and wings,a large greens/fruits area,a cutting station with chicken and pork tenderloin,as well as some fish and a large variety of desserts. We had a $5off coupon so the lunch price was very reasonable. Definitely not the best buffet out there but it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"**BRUNCH REVIEW** 3.5 STARS

New buffet? New buffet with a location close enough to the strip for some fun, but off the strip so you don't deal with parking?! YASSS. 

Okay, so a group of 4 of us decided to try Sunday Brunch here during MLK weekend around 12pm. Needless to say, it was a LONG 1hr+ wait, but we made it with a hungry appetite! 

Food selection: 4 stars. Brunch had a LOT of breakfast options, eggs a bunch of different ways, bacon in two areas, biscuits and gravy, French toast, pancakes, sausage, toast, LOX AND BAGELS, prime rib, brisket, etc. They also have a lot of lunch items such as the Asian food, international areas, salad area, small bites on individual plates, etc. Everything was pretty good, but nothing was very over the top that I can remember wanting to go back for. My cousin went to the Omelet Bar which was probably the highlight for brunch! 
OH AND YEA UNLIMITIED MIMOSAS FTW!  (BUT FYI, not consistent. Some batches had a lot of juice, other had barely any...at one point I figured I should just get champagne and order a juice to make it myself LOL) 

Size: 3.5 stars- the ads make this place seem huge and exciting, as if it were another bacchanal. This is not the case. The place was big, yes, and there were \"stations\", but It really is just an upgraded version of a station casino. It has the same set up, but obviously a little newer and classier. 

Wait: 3 stars. It just opened AND we went for brunch, but waited about an hour or more to be seated. 

Service: 4 stars Our mimosas were constantly filled and our plates were taken fairly often. Nothing amazing, but they do their job well and kept us satisfied :) 

SUMMED UP: 
For the amount of time I spent in line, the price and the food selection, I probably would give this place 3.5 stars, the 4 is for me hoping to come back for lunch or dinner to try. 
We paid 19.99 for brunch with our red players card **You only get the larger discount with higher up cards** 
The food was good, but not amazing. Some foods were definitely picturesque (individual small plates in lieu of scooping on your own), but nothing wowed me in terms of taste/flavor.
The wait was fairly long, but for brunch I really shouldn't complain much.
The area was pretty, but seemed like a nicer version of station casinos....where I can brunch for about $11 rather than $20.

I'd like to come back and try the regular dinner and lunch foods. I feel those would be a better deal :)"}
{"text":"The aesthetics of this place is really nice. If I could give that 5 stars, I would. Even the presentation of some of the food selection is nice as well!

The quality of food is probably 3/5. It's okay, but not the greatest. The presentation probably makes up for a lot of it but that's why it equals out to 4 stars! Not a bad deal if you have a Players Card at the Palms, which is now owned by Station Casinos!"}
{"text":"Went in with some family from out of town, I have tried many buffets in Las Vegas but this one is now my favorite so far, good price great food, lots of choices, they only reason I did not give them 5 starts is because I was not impressed with the staff, the waitress was hovering over us the whole time and kept interrupting our conversations, I have a dessert shot glass that was broken and instead of apologizing and offering to get another she just took it and said I will let the chef know.
but otherwise I was impressed."}
{"text":"***DO NOT COME HERE.*** their customer service is absolutely terrible. We waited in line for over an hour and they keep you waiting to charge you dinner prices. It was exactly 4 after waiting for over an hour and they refused to honor the lunch price. The manager was a complete jerk  and she LAUGHED at us and accused us of lying about how long we waited after that we got a SO ARE YOU GOING TO PAY OR NOT YOU ARE HOLDING UP THE LINE. Do not let the price fool you. The staff is absolutely terrible and need to learn some customer service skills. There are PLENTY of other places you can eat at on the strip, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"Not that many choices. But it was ok.  A lot of the food was dry but the prime rib was the only thing that was worth it."}
{"text":"It was so so! 3.5 stars! Went for brunch because I saw an advertisement for 8.99 brunch, little did I know it was 20/per person since I didn't have the players card and high points . Just be aware , the price advertised has its catch . Other than that , mediocre food . I liked bacchanal better"}
{"text":"Come to Palms AYCE buffet. You will be sorry if you don't. This is the highlight of my Vegas trip.
Tell everyone. 20.00 dinner plus taxes. Chicken pot pie. The pastry flakes on top. Walnut shrimp is an adventure. Salmon melts. Shrimp cocktail is so fresh. I could go on and on but I want another plate."}
{"text":"Really like this buffet! Service was friendly. Food is very tasty most of them. I personally love the curry mussels. Also love the sautéed veggies its crunchy fresh! Over all I really enjoy it. get the rewards card so you get 2 dollars off. I just hope they keep this quality running."}
{"text":"I've seen the commercials that show this beautiful buffet and new foods and to come on in and try it. Well I did and I took the biggest critic I know, my mom. Well I have to say my mother remembered the old Palms with the small buffet and she said it was not the best. First I tried the Asian food station I must say that the rice was a little off it wasn't that great. Then we tried The Carving Station and the beef was really good. We stumbled upon the fried chicken wings and I have to say they were perfectly seasoned and little spicy and so delicious! Every vegetable dish we tried was delicious the vegetables were crisp and fresh. The mashed potatoes were really good. Now I must tell you the best thing there... they have a smoke station with ribs that are delicious and also you can find wonderful brisket that is both more moist and cooked to perfection. Wholesale treat yourself to fried turkey wings oh my goodness. Now the desserts to me were not good the ice creams were crystalled but the white chocolate covered strawberries were the bomb. We did go on a Sunday so we were able to have the champagne brunch; we got there around 3 and stayed till about 5 pm... just eating everything that we could. If you are new to Las Vegas or if you have been here for a while, you know that buffets in the past used to be really really good now most of them really suck. This Buffet to me compares to The Cosmopolitan here in the Vegas area however they do not carry the Cosmopolitan prices.  Mom and I will try to get to this place as often as we can because we really really really enjoyed it. Well priced $18 per dinner buffet! The staff and manager (who is expecting) delivered excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Went there for late breakfast and saw them transition over to lunch on a Monday.  I was very impressed with the healthy options, vast selections, and quality of the buffet.  For starters, they have pressed mango juice with chia seeds and gluten free pancakes as part of their healthy choices.  Omelette station and regular pancakes, carved ham and two types of eggs benedict (go for the brisket one).  This was definitely pleasing and the things that they had there makes me want to go there again the next time I visit.  There were no overdried foods.  Desserts were mainly breakfast pastries and ice cream, but when transitioning over to lunch, they've got tiramisu and some other fine desserts.

TBH, I got more excited for this breakfast buffet and got more satisfaction than I did for the Bacchanal.  Maybe it was the price, maybe the quality, maybe both.  Bravo, Palms!"}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet on a Friday. The total cost per person was $12. 
The Palms has a renovated, and beautiful buffet inside. (The Palms has been undergoing a lot of renovation, which in my opinion is a way better look then what the Palms was beginning to look creepy and dark).
They have arranged the different serving areas into seven divisions.  The foods presented are in small serving vessels, something like the excellent,and I would.... recommend the Wicked Spoon ,at the Cosmopolitan. 
     The recipes found at each station are somewhat different then the 'standard' stations casinos buffet foods. The recipes are not bad nor are they excellent. 
    The saving grace in the whole A.Y.C.E. experience is the area called 'Smoke and Fire ',which serves smoked meats. I had the best smoked turkey wing. The salt and pepper chicken found on the World Pan side of the buffet was very good and tasty. My picture shows the chicken, with the delicious olive salad. The other items you see on the plate, in the photo, not so good.  All of their fish dishes and the calamari were rubbery, dry, and overcooked.
   The desserts I think are a failure. In my opinion, the Station Casinos are below standard for what could be provided to the general public. (Eating at stations casinos desserts are often processed sugar put into the shape of something: be it pies, cakes or soft serve ice cream).  I had the pistachio gelato. The gelato  was heavy, lacking flavor, and loaded with sugar. It should not be called gelato in my opinion.
     All the other dishes presented that day looked bland and unappetizing with a selection of some odd morsels for a lunch time buffet. There is no Deli area which would have been a great addition to the buffet.- To serve a deli section as part of a buffet experience, for example like a N.Y. style would be great!  Stations have not done that, and in my opinion probably could. 
    I was there at noon when they should have been on their game at the salad bar which was messy, food around edges, with spoons that had been used for other salads put in with other salads. I chose not to eat any of their salad options except for their olive salad which was pretty good.
The staff were friendly and courteous. Their beverages average  Our waitress was good and for $12.... life couldn't be better. 
    I don't think I would take friends there from out of town , but would go directly to Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock, because they seem to just do it a little better with their tastes and some of their recipes.
 I will go back again in the future.  I will come back to this review with an update. Because it's the new kid on the block, for the locals, I would recommend people to go to it and judge themselves because like all food service there are off days."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place the food was great 
I didn't want to leave I wanted to eat here for ever lol"}
{"text":"The line on Saturday night took me around 30mins... fave food the spicy mussels! Cant find them anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place reopened two weeks ago and what a turnaround. The ambiance is great; the space is inviting; and the food is...awesome! I compare this buffet to Cosmopolitan's wicked spoon buffet (except that it's better because it's reasonably priced!) I'm not a huge buffet fan in generally, but the food was quite enjoyable here - someone knows what they are doing. We tried the buffet for breakfast, but will be going back for dinner. Great variety in choices; the baked goods were really well done (esp the blueberry scone and cinnamon roll). The frittata, rice w/ egg, cold salads, chilaquiles and pizza were standouts. The fresh pressed juice was also great. Very happy to see the buffet and Palms for that matter, make a comeback."}
{"text":"Currently eating at the buffet. Great foods, service, and atmosphere. My favorites included the chicken pot pie and cold pressed juices. My only question is why you would have your hard working hostesses wear hard heeled pumps. Every step they take, I can see the discomfort and pain on their faces. Who's ever idea this was needs to have their head examined. Save the hostesses feet and change their shoes."}
{"text":"Man, Over rated by people looking at the food, not the overall experience.
First the wait for the small buffet was horrifying. The system of getting people into this buffet is so flawed that I won't be back based on that fact. 
We waited behind a party of 11 and 6 and 5 ppl ahead of us, where the cashier basically stood at her station and watched water dry while the other side which was the VIP Line moved like clockwork people going in with 3 4 2 ppl. no issue. She turns to tell me, \" oh there are just waiting for tables,\" clearly a flat Lie. 
The Food was so-so Bbq ribs were dry, and i felt like i could bring them home to my dog to chew on. The Soups were Cold and the dessert tasted of Gross concoction that was not at all what it was supposed to be. The Brûlée was horrifying, it literally tasted like Paste custard. Nope, Won't be back."}
{"text":"Updated to a well deserved 5 stars! My new favorite buffet and likely will be voted #1 best value in 2018. I'll take side bets. 

I've now enjoyed breakfast, lunch, and dinner and think all are simply amazing. They overlap so no waiting for changeover, get both breakfast and lunch items if you come around 10am for example. 

Great price but get your players card first to get the discounted (advertised price) you might expect. 

So Much Value!
Food quality is spectacular. 
Unique and fun experience.
A lot of premade dishes so you can try several different things. 
Quick prompt service. 
Cheap price but 5 star food.

Service is fantastic! The cashiers are nice. They have 2-3 people to seat you and always friendly with smiles, even had few of them ask if everything was good while seated. They say goodbye and thanks for coming. Servers are the best, come around very often with refills and work together if on breaks or busy.

Managers listened to my complaints, signs are changed and things are labeled correctly (for the most part). The salad condiments serving spoons are better but still hard to serve, they'll likely improve it though. The fruit is kept full, haven't seen it like I did the first day I went. I said before the fruit needed a bigger tray but that's not true, I just wanted it to be fresher cut and kept full, and they stay on top of it now. 

Every food dish is made with care. Lots of flavor and unique items you won't find at other buffets. Some complained Stations didn't copy their other buffets but that's silly, they took a chance and now stand out from all buffets. 

It is my new go to spot. It'll be hard for me to justify spending $10 or even $20 more for less quality food elsewhere. Other places have longer waits and colder food and worse service.

Love the chairs and tables. Chairs are flexible in the back, well padded, and have a handle to easily grab. Solid wood table tops that are always clean and sturdy. 

They don't have a year long VIP pass yet but I'll be first to get one if they do. 

Hurry up and go before I eat everything! :-)"}
{"text":"The highlight of our 6 day visit. Wish we found this place sooner during our stay...it was the last meal of the trip, but what a grand finale!! Walnut shrimp, blue cheese wedge salad, papaya salad, and jackfruit enchiladas were very memorable. And I loved dessert bar...amazing!! We will return next year...keep up the phenomenal food service!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is pretty good especially for their price. The pizza is more of a flatbread with no sauce so it's not the best. They have really good salmon there. They have tons of seating if you want to go their with a big group."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good...

The staff was little \"hover-y\"...

They would be better served overall to not have such deep serving areas because it was difficult to get to items in the back."}
{"text":"Best buffet that I have eaten in Vegas. Super affordable, great options and high quality. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"A remodeled Palm's buffet that everyone has been waiting for has opened.  Not  typical at all. More of a \"tapas\" buffet. Small servings in small plates.  Concept was  that the food will always remain hot when you eat it. But I also think this will   minimize food wastage. They also have a section called REViVAL that caters to vegetarians.  Salads are delicious! They can make a cookie ice cream to your taste.  I noticed on my second visit that all the servers and hostesses have a modern take on their uniforms. Even their shoes are the same. This place is  real affordable gourmet eat! Make sure you sign up with their card to reflect discount price."}
{"text":"Nice buffet here for lunch and dinner (more foods). They're renovation this place now is good. And foods is great."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because even though the food was okay, it was not worth waiting in line for an hour and half. The line was huge and there were plenty of tables ready but there was only one cashier helping people pay and go inside. I would suggest they add more cashiers/boss boys to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"This is the remodeled buffet of Palms and didn't disappoint . Everything was on point --clean, airy and nicely decorated .Variety and quality of food selections were very good for the price. Friendly and very attentive servers too."}
{"text":"This is probably THE best Stations buffet in town now. If you're looking for a buffet with actual HEALTHY options, this is the one! Champagne is even included in the price.  and Rewards members get $4.00 off with their card. Larry, one of the greeters, thanked us for our patience waiting to be seated. He told us they were short on servers (it was a Sunday at about 1140am). We didn't notice: our server Yanet was on top of everything, and we never waited for our beverages, refills or anything at all. The orange juice was very fresh, with a little pulp. Coke products served here. The champagne was light and tasty, not super cheap cheesy stuff other places serve. Great layout. The food was outstanding. On the salad bar there was an assortment of different greens including spinach and kale, ceviche, lox and bagels, fresh fruits, fruit salads, four different soups, an even shrimp cocktail, which was excellent, as was the kale apple walnut salad. I also enjoyed the watermelon citrus salad very much. There was a poke tuna on white rice which was cold and served in a dish on a frozen serving area, and was very tasty. I also loved the different take they served of eggs Benedict. My favorite item by far was the cauliflower quinoa grits--a dash of brown sugar made them excellent! My hubs had beef brisket, and roast beef. The former looked kind of grey and he said tasted a bit rubbery, and the carved roast beef was underdone, so he was a bit disappointed in those choices. He did enjoy the French roast, roast ham, pizza, and made to order omelette. We both liked the pineapple, watermelon, and cantaloupe. Pistachio gelato was great, and the dessert area was huge! Excellent coffee. Food prep areas were spotless and staff could be seen wiping food serving areas constantly, as they were spotless and free if spills, etc. All around just outstanding from start to finish! Even though it's far from our house, we will return to the AYCE Buffet, AND The Palms now, too-- as we're excited to see all the changes Stations Casinos is making here."}
{"text":"Great organization!!(separate by section)


No waiting server are friendly and fast serving!

No salty, Not too sweet. Very good quality food."}
{"text":"The best buffet I've tried in Vegas so far and I've tried many because I come here every month! Save your money and go here it's nothing but delicious and the presentation is adorable !!!"}
{"text":"One of the better buffets in Vegas. It's a good price $21.99 for us, but you can get two dollars off each ticket if you get a Palms rewards card at customer service, or you can get the buffet for $17.99 if you have the Palms yellow card. I'm not even sure what that card is, but ask about it. 

There were many options for people with different dietary restrictions. There were plenty of light options as well, salads, etc. 

Favorites from the buffet: Stromboli, Pistachio macaroons (highly recommended), roast beef, creme brûlée

4.5/5 price 
5/5 Decor and service 
3/5 food"}
{"text":"Pretty good quality food.  The price is reasonable.  Place is clean and service adequate. Love small portions so we can try more variety. The salt and pepper chicken wing is really good."}
{"text":"Gosh, I really wanted to love this place but, I didn't. I decided to try this place based on the good reviews but, wasn't impressed at all. The service was bad, and the food really isn't good. Our waitress never showed up with our drinks after letting her know that our lemonades were weak and asked for juice instead. We came here for lunch on a weekday and yes, the cost was fair but, that's about it. Its not a lot of variety of food dishes to choose from. The only beef option was a slider and the top of the bread was rock hard. Nothing was seasoned at all. The only chicken dish They had was salt and pepper wings that had neither seasonings. Not broccoli, string beans or any basic buffet foods. They had blackened catfish that looked more like a Mexican fish dish. I had mashed potatoes that still had huge chunks of raw potato in it that choked me. The pork loin and turkey I had was dry. Fried rice was hard as its been sitting out all day. Lunch started at 11, we arrived at noon. I have no idea why or how this place is 4 stars. $65 wasted. No, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is a solid Las Vegas buffet.  The desserts were definitely the highlight.  I was torn between three or four stars, but chose the former to differentiate it from the decidedly superior buffet we visited during the same trip."}
{"text":"Great quality and good selection. Very reasonable compared to some of the other buffets in the area.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars is they do not have crab legs anymore."}
{"text":"The pictures just looked good. But it was just the pics that were good. Can't believe this from The Palms. Even as I entered the property, I felt this wasn't the Palms of 15 years ago. It felt sad. The Palms became that casino the cousin Eddy took Clark to when he down and out."}
{"text":"So let me start by sayin this establishment has 7 buffet stations...however the only suitable one for VEGANS is the \"Revival\" station. Everything at this station is VEGAN for the most part so I highly recommend it. So why 3 stars you ask? Well it cost 17.00 bucks for Lunch and 21 bucks for Dinner...even for all the regular food at the other stations that kind of money simply does not justify the means for buying anything here. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet if LEGIT!! So delicious, friendly staff, free parking. Great value! Going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Clean, food was very good, long line but worth the wait! The price was affordable for Las Vegas! Bottomless mimosas made for a fun brunch."}
{"text":"For $20 bucks, I really can't ask for anything more. Came for dinner, it's $21 per person but with the basic players card you get a dollar off. You can sign up for one for free if you don't have one. If you have one, you can get discount for you and someone else with just one card. Higher levels get a better deal, as cheap as $18 for dinner. Basic soda and iced tea included. Alcohol available for purchase. See menu photo I posted.

We came close to 8pm and waited in line for about an hour. They close at 9pm but serves food until 9:30p.

Variety is a bit limited but the quality of the food is better than a lot of buffets I've been to. What I especially liked was the asian food. They had a curry, Mongolian beef and walnut shrimp that were all good. Prime rib was good too. The soft serve was not watery as I expected and was actually really creamy and good.

They also had a bbq station with chicken, ribs and brisket. The smoke on the meat was good but all lacked seasoning. 

Overall it was a pretty good buffet especially for the price."}
{"text":"Dinner 02/09/2018 
Especially for the price, this is my new favorite buffet in Las Vegas. I love the fact that much of the food is already set out as a serving size, rather than just a free-for-all, grab-as-much-as-you-can. The mini buckets of shrimp and seafood boil were awesome. The mini-tureens of French onion soup and individual plates of blue-cheese wedge salad are ingenious! The variety of foods is ample, and the dessert bar is better than most (the macaroons are awesome). If you like smoky BBQ, you'll really enjoy the beef brisket. They even had duck with white beans, which was amazing. It may not be the biggest buffet in town, but they do a great job with what they serve, and for $20 each, I have zero complaints. We will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but the food was average at best.

At there both for a dinner and then breakfast a few days later to give it a 2nd shot.

Service was excellent and very friendly - can't do better there.

Unfortunately most of the food i ate (pancakes, beef, pizza) was pretty bland. Not bad but not good. 

Deserts were 4* i'd say... 

Luckily I had no wait for breakfast and maybe 5 minutes for dinner... 

Don't think i'd go back even if staying there again."}
{"text":"Overall a great lunch dining experience.  The selection was excellent ans the price was reasonable for a Vegas buffet."}
{"text":"I saw the ads on TV Palms new buffet was open. I decided to try it on Christmas Day. The price was only like $22.00 with the players card. The wait wasn't bad but I'm sure it got longer later in the day. The quality of the food items was on par with Aria and Cosmopolitan but at half the price. The only draw back was the number of selections. 
I felt there could have been more Mexican and Italian dishes. The walnut shrimp was to die for. The prime rib also very tender and not as fatty as most in town. The deserts were delicious including 
the large selection of ice cream.
For lunch this buffet would be ideal where quality and price is more important than an endless supply of tasteless dishes. It's not quantity it's quality! And you can't beat the price with your players club card."}
{"text":"The vibe awsome...the food amazing..price reasonable a complete hit!!!! My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday. Honestly I was a little disappointed. This place would have potential, but therefore it needs some work. I tried almost everything. Some meats were good, others were not so good, way to dry. One station had Brussels Sprouts and they were litterly uncooked, just looked roasted from the outside, seamed to be held under fire to look like cooked, but totally raw inside. Who wants to eat that? The ones served at the Asian Station were cooked ok. The 2 dumpling kinda things at the Asian station had some weird tasting meat inside, couldn't eat it. Had some grilled octopus, Love that normally and it was ok. One side was fine, the other side of it was tasting dry and burned. 
And the dessert station is a total fail besides the bread pudding and that sugar free tart. I'm
Not sure what you can do wrong with desserts, even the worst buffets in this town have better desserts than AYCE. I'm sure if you take care of those issues, it would be a great place. But as of now I'm not really willing to go back and eat there again.  The server was awesome, he did a great job."}
{"text":"Great buffet for how inexpensive it is!! Much better then even Wicked Spoon that is twice as much. Food was fresh and hot at all times. Unique dishes. The wait staff was very friendly. Desserts could be a little better but other then that great! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Good price. Only thing missing is no crab but food was very tasty. I recommend trying this buffet!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST VALUE BUFFET in Las Vegas. There are some reviews that complain about the lack of seafood, for example. This is not the buffet for prodigious amounts of crab legs and shrimp cocktail. Come here for 1) the flavors and 2) the quality. For 17.99 with players card, we enjoyed top quality dishes, most very delicately prepared. The cuts of meat they use are excellent. You have to understand that when you choose the mini-ramekin of Moroccan Lamb, you are getting fork-tender lamb chunks and not hockey pucks. The spices and preparation are spot-on. The Korean short ribs melt in your mouth like cotton candy. 

There is a honey-walnut shrimp to die for. The Mongolian beef is not only flavorful, but again uses a cut-above of meat that other buffets in this price range just would not use. Nothing tough or stringy. Also, the dessert presentation (cinnamon roll bread pudding with hot caramel sauce, for Pete's sake!) is what you would experience at a 40.00 buffet. 

Peruse the other photos to get a concept of the complete offerings. I'm here to tell you that the quality is the star here. (If you're a coffee drinker, don't fail to get a cuppa the house brand, ROYAL CUP.  Bold and delicious)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Just go to a nice restaurant. Took my wife here, they were out of Brisket, and a couple other items. When I asked the chef about it he said he would have some soon. My table was right next to the station so I was able to see during my entire meal if any was put out. About an hour later I asked him again and he said it wasn't ready yet. I stayed till 9pm when they close and still none was out. Wasted $50 on me and my wife's dinner. Will not be coming back. The Asian food was very hard and sticky, the Mexican food tasted unseasoned. (The elote does not look anywhere near the pictures). If you're gonna eat anything here the cookie ice cream sandwiches weren't bad and the fruit tasted fresh."}
{"text":"This is the 8th time we came to eat breakfast here. But today was very not the best experience we had. Food today was warm but not hot as normal. And we got here at 816am. Everything was ok. But their so called CONGEE was totally so so thick that it was like warm rice pudding. I hope they'd check what they put out before any of us get to it. Don't get me wrong. Service is always great and our server Benji today was awesome as always. But the food today was lack luster."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. 
Rolled out of the buffet.
For affordable prices go during the week at lunch time."}
{"text":"The food here was very mediocre. All the food was under seasoned. There weren't many options. The servers were ok. They didn't keep bothering you as you are eating so that was nice. All of the desserts were gross, especially the cookies (hard as rocks!). The line to get in was ridiculous. We spent 30 min in line because they only had one person on the register. They had another guy, but he was very iffy. He would take one and skip 3. I guess you get what you paid for. We paid $13.99 for the lunch buffet and I can see why. I won't be returning.  They have potential, but they need a lot of work."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this buffet, considering it had an overall good review.  The selection was slightly diverse but not as wide as I expected.  I was there for an early dinner, about 5:30 and felt the food was not warm in some of the stations.  The service was prompt and waitress checked on us regularly.  This isn't a bad buffet, at $25, but I doubt I will come back again."}
{"text":"New Years Eve dinner with friends - my first time here with the boyfriend. We had some awesome grub! I didn't expect it to be as diverse as it was. Lots of items to choose from - you definitely won't find Hometown Buffet food here. I liked the desserts and the Italian food the best. Serving some Asian fusion dishes too was a plus in my book. The seating was very comfortable, tastefully done and roomy. I didn't feel squished in or rushed by the servers. Chris was our main server and he was definitely on point with our mood. He rolled with our conversations and had some laughs with us. We appreciated his good nature and courteous attitude. It made our dinner even more pleasant. I hope that we sit in his area again when we return to Vegas. He is quite the host. Thank you Chris for being a wonderful server! Keep up the great work :-D

Lastly, Bring your casino rewards card so that you don't miss out on possible savings. Pricing is typical for a Vegas hotel buffet but this one is sure to please. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Huge selection for breakfast not your run of the mill choices. Tons of verity. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food for a very reasonable price. Service is excellent. No line. Just walk in. Very happy dining experience"}
{"text":"I wish I took pictures of everything that came to our table. This is the best buffet I've been to in vegas and I'm a picky eater. I was so happy they had Prime Rib and French Onion soup. Do you know how hard it is to find French Onion soup even at a regular restaurant? Our waiter never let our drinks go less the half empty before refilling us. And the desserts are to die for. My favorite was the maccarons and creme Brulee. Sadly the maccarons are not made here but still amazing :)"}
{"text":"Went here to try because we recieved a BOGO free mailer. Started off great with small but good selections of apps. My wife and I enjoyed the ceviche and NE crab boil. Sushi can be skipped, nothing great. Cod was okay too. When I had meat, that where my disappontment started. Brisket, Ribs and the beef on the carving station (not prime rib) were all dry. Walnut shrimp is great though. Wait staff is friendly. Lastly, the dessert station has good number of selection. May come back, but not too soon."}
{"text":"We are locals.  We had high expectations, but they are completely unprepared to open.  We walked by the restaurant around 5:30 and there were lots of empty seats, so we hopped in line.  After waiting for almost 30 minutes without any line movement, we decide to leave.  We walked passed by again and there were still large sections that were not seated.  The cashiers weren't helping/seating anyone.  We were all just waiting for no reason.  Why market and invite locals to come if you aren't going to be ready?  It's a buffet, it can't be that hard.  Probably wouldn't try again.  Found it disrespectful."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this buffet. New modern interiors with a relaxed atmosphere. Every plate I had was delicious and perfectly cooked and seasoned-all for a reasonable price (2 buffets for $28)"}
{"text":"I've been to the old buffet at the Palms, and it was an okay/bad buffet with bottomless wine. The new buffet is, to say the least, unbelievable. For only $17 for dinner, their selection and food quality is out of this world. The strawberry ice cream is to die for. Only bummer: drinks no longer included. No matter, give the Palms a try again!"}
{"text":"So many salted reviews, using the same photos amazing.  This buffet is not the Cosmopolitan Wicked Spoon, nor approaching anything like that quality buffet.  

I received 2 - 2 for 1 breakfast coupons and my lady also received 2 coupons for a Palm AYCE Palms Breakfast Buffets.   We had not been to the Palms for 6 months and we went taking advantage of the 2 for 1 pricing. 

My review After liking the updated buffet premises: only change I really noticed an added a Gelato section, and a few more tappa style dishes.  I believe it is difficult for a Casino not have a decent breakfast buffet: cook eggs or make a omelet to order station, and have bacon, potatoes, and sausage very close to that to order station.  

The Omelet Chief was a very adept in remembering orders, he was polite but not a entertaining or cheerful type individual.  However he must be close to one of the top Omelet Chief the Stations have in their employ.  He was quick, & did not seem to confuse orders as some Station Casino cooks labor with.  Unfortunately he did not provide any pleasing customer interaction that is seen by numerous chiefs in Casino breakfast buffets. 

Maybe it was good the Chief was a good cook just following customers orders efficiently, as there were no Bloody Mary to greet the Hotel breakfast guests that may have been enjoying the Hotel facilities late into the previous evening.  

The remodeled Buffet was like most station's properties, similar in architectural style.  The new decor/layout in the Palm's was pleasing to the eye, food display has not changed as much from the Previous Palms buffet, but believe that is the result of three Chiefs hovering in the background that was keeping the staff on their toes.   

Added: Hard ice cream (Gelato area).  Price almost doubled.  No closing down, during change over from Breakfast to Lunch (a nice change).

Missing: the round Meat carving station that extended outward from center of food display aera.  Complimentary Beer and Wine served with lunch and dinner.  No Shrimp night on Tuesdays evenings as I stray from a Breakfast review.

Overall: I liked the location and newness of the premises, Hard Ice Cream (Gelato) was a necessary upgrade, with the Complimentary Beer and Wine being discontinued for Lunch and Dinner. A small \"no added Sugar area\" that includes 1 Gelato flavor.   I am worried when the hovering background Chief's disappear the buffet will suffer and the Palms AYCE will slide into a step above Sunset Buffet.  Currently I believe this buffet is a step below both Green Valley and Red Rock Casinos owned by the same parent company.  

If they send me a 2 for 1 coupon to use I will consider eating in this buffet, but I currently believe it is not worth $9 plus tip for breakfast with a Casino Card.  

Recently all Station owned Casinos have raised their buffet prices $2, including a competitor of Boulder Station, Sam's Town."}
{"text":"I was in town and wanted to try the newly renovated A.Y.C.E. buffet.  I read the 4 star reviews.  We came in at 10:30am for breakfast and was told that here were no more breakfast item and were to be charged lunch prices.  I was okay with that because I really wanted to check out the buffet.  Also, the price was very reasonable.  Our Host Tyreshia and Server Jonathon were outstanding.  The atmosphere was nice.  But the food was not fresh and appealing.  A lot of the items needed to be refilled or stirred.  Lots of spills on the counters, maybe from breakfast crowd. The omelette/pasta station was still open.  When it was my turn to order, the cook said no more omelettes, just fried eggs.  He said the same thing to the lady behind me.  The only thing different about the buffet was the kicked up a notch corn on the cob.  Mexican station was missing salsa or pico for my beef taco.  The tortillas were in two small steel bowls with cover.  But they were dry and hard.  Regardless, taco meat was good.  The desserts were not memorable.  The best things in the buffet were the little bread sticks and chicken pot pie.   The bread sticks were baked perfect.  It was still hot and were delicious!"}
{"text":"The buffet was ok, the service was amazing and by far the best buffet service; even better than the Bacchanal buffet's service but sadly not food wise the Bacchanal is by far better. The Asian food isn't good nor the raw fish are fresh, which can be dangerous to eat; such as the salmon turning brown. The best thing they have are in the BBQ area, and most deserts."}
{"text":"Food was decent, our waitress was great, the main reason for the 3 stars instead of a solid 4 to 4.25 was the wait to get in and the way its ran/set up. 

We waited in line for a solid 30 minutes even though there was only about 7 or 8 groups in front of us. This was also 30 minutes before they were going to close. So we finally get to the counter pay and have to wait while the hostess is \"finding\" us a table. Once she walks us past the wall where the tables are literally half of them are empty/no one using them. So the dining room is half full at best and we're waiting a half hour lol??? There was easily enough tables for everyone in line to be seated all at once. I sorta can understand if they are trying to make it look busy but this was right before they were closing and they're making us wait for nothing! Im not sure who the manager was or if there even was one but anyone can immediately see the line/seating set up is horrible, get it together Palms."}
{"text":"Hey do you want eat at AYCE? Yeah, for sure where at?! This was my initial response when a group of my friends asked me a couple weeks ago. In my mind I thought they were referring to an all you can eat restaurant, Lol. I quickly learned that a new local buffet just opened recently at Palms.

Upon arriving, there was a decent size line but it move quickly and seemed like the turnover is quick. Overall, the staff at AYCE were very friendly and had a great systematic way of clearing tables and refilling drinks in a timely and efficient manner. So kudos to the staff!! The ambience reminded me of Wicked Spoon at Cosmo with a bit of Social Libertine at Mandalay Bay. Kinda, of hipster style but value minded buffet that was surprisingly delicious.

Everything I had was pretty good. I personally like...
-Beef Brisket, Tender and the spices was good.
-Corn Bread, Moist and flavorful without being dried out.
-Raclette Station, Build your own mixed veggie and meat with melted cheese on top. 
-French Macaroons, these were amazingly delicious and they a good variety of flavors.
-Gelato Ice Cream Sandwich Station, This was cool and satisfying. Build your own ice cream cookie sandwich!

Overall, a great value buffet and satisfying dishes that will pleased everyone's taste buds.

2018 Yelp Review #16"}
{"text":"Usually buffets are outrageously expensive, and no one has time for that when you're a poor student. But this one was not so bad when it comes to pulling out your wallet, especially if you get a player's card which will get you a discount. However, I was not so crazy about the food. My favorite items on the menu were definitely the mashed potatoes and the macarons. If I wasn't so full at the end I would've gotten an ice cream sandwich which they make personalized with cookies and their house ice cream. If I had relatives in town I would take them here to eat because frankly everyone loves going to buffets when they come to Vegas. However, I don't think I would come here on my own. The staff was very kind and the atmosphere was relaxed, but the food was not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Don't know where to start. They allow dogs inside that aren't service animals, mislabel their food and have horrible food prep (see pics). Was very much looking forward to eating at this buffet after flying in from California to vacation in Vegas. First, they allowed a older man with a CHIHUAHUA to enter the casino and feed the dog from his plate as you can see in the pics the food on the floor and the lovely pooch waiting for his food. Second, their \"paella\" looked more like potato mush from yams. Rice was soggy and turned into a pile of mush (see pics). Third, their food labels did not match the dishes displayed. You can see a cabbage salad that was labeled \"Cous cous salad\" this was just one of many dishes mislabel. Their white rice tasted like plastic and when I asked the hostes about it she said \"oh it's just hard\". Huge disappointment, Horrible tasting food, infection control issues and safety hazards with food mislabeling."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this buffet, especially because we paid the early bird pricing. 

We had several cuisine options, I think my favorite was the Chinese selections which were, ramen, sushi(didn't eat), dumplings and more. I also ate the flamin hot elotes...so good. 

They also have a variety of desserts which I got a scoop of coffee gelato. 

I couldn't see myself eating here every day but I would definitely add this buffet into my places to go during my next visit."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet opens at 8am!

Relatively new to Las Vegas, this buffet began on December 22, 2017.  Besides breakfast, they also have lunch and dinner buffets!

Located in the Palms Casino, A.Y.C.E. seems to be a great deal at $8.99 for the Breakfast Buffet, but...the fine print alludes to this price with a Gold Players Card or higher.  Regular price is $12.99. If you have the basic card gets you in at $10.99 plus tax and tip.

On a positive note, the Parking is free; the environment is cheerful; and the service is pleasant!  It was better than other buffets because there was no line to get in, and it wasn't crowded!

There were so many different stations and choices, but I had to focus, knowing that my tummy space is limited.  I liked the fresh fruits, oatmeal, tapioca, and variety of breads the best!  The fresh Orange juice,  eggs Benedict, and quiche were also memorable!

Dear Daniel and I happily scouted out the terrain, took photos, and finally settled down to our feast!  We were happily full and enjoyed our food coma!  It was a fun and repeatable foodie adventure!"}
{"text":"Waste of money and station points. Nothing spectacular to eat. The staff behind the food stations are rude and unfriendly. 

I had to beg for some mussels. They would not put them out even though it was lunch time with a sign saying they were offering them. I was told they wanted to finish off the breakfast item first. I'm paying for lunch not breakfast. The server was overwhelmed and slow. She was polite but stressed out. 

Not to be funny, but sunset station was better and that's not saying a lot. 

Desserts were cheap and stale. Nothing wonderful.

Everything was either fried or drenched in sauces. The sushi rice was so cold and stale.

First time there, btw. Was so looking forward to come and have a great experience as a local in Vegas. The lines were long even for a President line. Too bad. Casino looks a lot better. Maybe buffet will improve overtime. 

Just disappointed to waste my points on sub par food.

I know management doesn't read these, so it's okay to let you all know. Good luck."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this buffet. In Vegas I feel like there are only two kinds of buffet: the $55 buffet, or the $8.99 buffet. AYCE falls in the middle! The atmosphere here is really cool and new, Palms is doing well with the renovations so far. I've been to the GVR and Red Rock buffets but AYCE definitely offers some creative dishes. My favorites include the (pesto?) pasta during lunch and the small salmon dishes and different Mac and cheeses during dinner. My body is highly likely made of 35% cheese. Confused as to the reviews that mention \"not enough shrimp in the bucket...\" It's... a buffet. Go get... more? If you're a fan of buffets definitely try it out!!"}
{"text":"The lunch menu was only marginally better and the dinner selection was considerably better than the Red Rock Casino buffet.  The Chicken Panang and lemon meringue dishes were outstanding.

We arrived at 2.07pm on a Tuesday and the wait time was 30 long minutes.

The ambiance and decor was inviting but we were not a fan of the Servers wearing jeans.

Given the wait time and overall dining experience we probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"For being one of the lower priced quality buffets in town, versus $45 at the Wynn or Caesar's, it is really good. Great selection and quality. Service was excellent. The only reason it does not get five stars is because none of the food was really hot only lukewarm.  All seven stations were very good."}
{"text":"It was recommended to us by an Uber driver because it was cheaper, but it's a great example of you get what you pay for. Not much selection."}
{"text":"I'll say out of the 3 of us in my party, I believe I enjoyed dinner here the most. I believe the big let down was the roast beef. While prime rib is as much of a thing of the past at most reasonably priced Vegas buffets as their $9.99 prices, the beef option shouldn't be most comparable to chewing gum.

That disappointment aside the majority of the selections were wonderful. The walnut shrimp was incredible. I've never had a shrimp plate that was so much shrimp and so little coating. They did an excellent job with the poultry. The ceviche was delicious. Little things like mashed sweet potatoes were great highlights for me personally.

I didn't try the desserts, but they did look very good.

Opinions differed at the table, but the short line and the overall excellent food makes this a pretty solid option for right off the strip."}
{"text":"This was the worst buffet I have ever been to in Las Vegas. The set up was stupid and looked like it was trying to be super fancy. The ribs were dry and tasteless macaroni and cheese was terrible the only thing on the whole buffet we enjoyed was the potatoes and gravy probably because we were so hungry. The price is 19.99 a person we had a coupon for 1 free still not even close to what it was worth. They spent way too much time trying to look fancy they completely forgot about the basics. We will not return"}
{"text":"I had a family dinner ...loved the interior sitting and dinning

Food was better than Red Rock more flavors than before

I would come again"}
{"text":"After a movie, I came here to try out the redone buffet.  It was a Monday night and not busy at all at 5 PM.  I like the new design and the setup is very good.

As soon as I was seated, I was greeted by my server and she soon had my iced tea at the table.  I then took the time to walk the length of the areas to see what they were serving.  They have gone to the pre-sized portions with some dishes.  I'm sure this helps cut down on waste because you're taking a small dish or bowl with a limited amount of food.

I passed on some pasta because it looked dry from sitting under the lamps for a while.  I was drawn by their flaming elotes (they weren't very hot) so it was a bit disappointing.  I also had a small shrimp cocktail in a miniature bucket.  Not bad at all.

For dessert, I had some macarons--they have it spelled wrong--a miniature eclair.  I passed on getting a handmade ice cream cookie sandwich because I was full by then.  It seems like a busy night would be the best time to be here as the food would turnover faster instead of sitting under lamps.

The staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Here's the problem.

The food is different and quite good, especially for a low cost buffet.  And I can't fault the service.

However, they play the f*cking music so loud that it's almost impossible to have a conversation.  I complained to the assistant manager who told me she could do nothing about it.  When I did get the manager on the phone I was told the level of music was decided by higher up.

I called the food and beverage director who failed to bother to call back.  The same with the hotel manager.  What I was told was they want to cater to a younger crowd.  You know - people who have no money.

It's a shame but they have lost a customer until such time as they realize adult enjoy a meal without music blaring in the background."}
{"text":"A big improvement from the buffet at Palms before. Some dishes that tasted good, and place is really wide and good looking. Some things like the cocktail shrimp was hard and flavorless. Probably not worth it for $20, but if there was a discount then I might go back. Overall, mas o menos."}
{"text":"Loved it, wish I could eat more! 

Only one star less because the pasta was pretty undercooked when I went but I mixed the white and red sauce and it was freaking delicious!"}
{"text":"what a great breath of fresh air the new and most definitely improved buffet at the Palms is! I must be honest when I say I was a little concerned just from my past experiences at station casinos buffets, boy did they prove me wrong! I hope this is a positive trend that will be taking place in all of the station casino buffets! Love the porchetta, mac & cheese and Au gratin potatoes. The small individual portions give you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything. Make sure you get the brisket and the highlight....the pizza..yes.. I said the pizza! 

It obvious Great though and research was put into this buffet! This buffet is by far the best value on or near the strip. For three people on a holiday weekend we would've spent the same amount for one person at a very popular buffet on the strip."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the newly remodeled Palms buffet A.Y.C.E on 5/19/2018 for dinner with my fiancé. The price of $17.99 isn't that bad as long as you have a Station Rewards Card. At first glance the remodeled buffet area looked nice, better than some of the other station casino buffets that I have been to in the past.
With trying some of the food, the salad bar area had three types of lettuce, decent amount of toppings and dressing. Also In the salad bar area there's a hummus bar with five different types of hummus to try. I tried the regular and roasted garlic and both tasted great.
The salmon sushi was very delicious, even though it's not made there, it was cold and the rice was soft. The Cashew shrimp wasn't bad, had a couple of warm and cold pieces. At the pasta station the cook was very nice, there's only two types of pasta to choose from and a couple of toppings and the serving was plentiful, so much pasta that I couldn't eat it all.
I love lasagna, however the lasagna was terrible, the sauce tasted water down and the meat was tasteless.  Tried a couple pieces of the beef bourguignan and it was cold, went up to the chef at the buffet and said something about how cold the meat was. The Chef tried a piece and agreed that the meat was cold and removed and replaced with a fresh hot batch.
On the dessert area, the fudge brownies were heated and tastes warm and outstanding and I had to get seconds. The cheese cake was also outstanding. However there was covered strawberries that had a pink coating on them and they were way too sweet.

Overall: the buffet was ok especially for the price.
Would we go again, I don't know."}
{"text":"Make Palms into a locals Station Casino?  Brilliant!!

This kinda opened the gates for me - I mean, I was OK with the Palms before the management change, but back then the buffet was really kinda lacking.  I mean before it shut down for renovations, it was doing 24 hour duty!  It was an all day buffet/cafe!  Crazy!

Fast forward to 2018 and the finished masterpiece that is now the AYCE Buffet in the Palms.  What an improvement!  They definitely went to a more Station Casinos theme, and for the better I think.  

Wifey & I waited a month or 2 before coming to the AYCE Buffet because it seemed to be super busy with all Station Casino player's card members wanting to try it!  Using those points, yo!  Even on the day we finally visited for lunch (with our locals discount), the wait in line was about 30 minutes.  But hey it was worth it!  Such an improvement!  We tried out tons of dishes:

-Duck Cassoulet with White Beans
-Moroccan Lamb
-Vegan Stuffed Peppers
-Calamari Steak
-Jackfruit Enchiladas (Yes!  Jackfruit!)
-Poke Bowl
-Shakshuka
-Smoked Brisket Benedict
-Watermelon Citrus Salad
-Shrimp Cocktail
-Ice Cream Sandwich with Cookies & Cream and Butterfinger

They gettin' fancy here!  Some wordy dishes, but some great new tastes!  I was really surprised by the Jackfruit Enchiladas, tasty!  Made for vegans!  Was consistent to actual enchiladas with meat.  The Smoked Brisket Benedict was a standout as well, good smoke from what looked like an indoor industrial smoker!

I could get used to being a local here at the AYCE Buffet in the Palms!  Definitely not disappointed.  Lots of choices for all, and the prices are still consistent with your Red Rock/Green Valley Ranch buffets.  And now with the added benefit of using your Station Casino rewards!!  

Oh yeah, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was so glad to find a buffet were they have a section vegan gluten free. The section is very small and no more than 6 items. Unfortunatly the tabasco in the cauliflower and vegetable ratatouille did not do it for me. But what can you expect for a $15 buffet ?"}
{"text":"A.Y.C.E Buffet is one of those buffets where you get the most bang for your buck.  $20.99 for an all-you-can-eat dinner is a deal.  Get $3 off if you use your Station Card.  An even better deal is their breakfast under $15.  As for the food, quality is just okay.  A.Y.C.E is perfect if you're trying to get calories in.  I'm not a huge buffet guy in the first place.  I'm also not a big eater unless I have to be.  I stayed away from the salad bar, desserts, and breads in order to keep my belly empty enough for the protein feast that I was going to partake in.  I had roughly 2,000 calories to spend and made sure I spent all of it.  I had 3 plates of protein and it included about 3 oz. carne asada, 3 oz. of walnut shrimp, 7 oz. of roasted turkey breast, 4 oz. of roast beef, a chicken thigh, chicken leg, 1 oz. of tilapia, 4 servings of salmon, 5 oz. of brisket, a cup of shredded cheese and one Brussels sprout.  I was craving crab legs and boiled eggs, but they didn't have it.  The roasted turkey breast and salmon were my two favorites.  I thought that the brisket and carne asada was on the dry side.  Overall, I recommend A.Y.C.E for the price.  You can say that I got my money's worth.  I arrived hungry and left full enough to skip my last meal of the day."}
{"text":"My server was super friendly and the place is very fresh and clean.   Thy have LOTS and LOTS of food.  Larki was super friendly and fast on the drink the refills .  Sevda is super nice at the hostess stand .  They have a huge variety of stuff to choose from so the question is why two star review

Because I'm driving by  and the big marquee out front says lunch 1199 with boarding pass.  I have a boarding pass and was charged $13.99.  Everyone that doesn't get one pays $15.99

I've spent 15 minutes trying to get my $2 back after I showed the picture of the sign and no one will listen to me

They have lost me as a customer forever  and  they just opened up 2 weeks ago"}
{"text":"Good variety for carnivores and vegetarians alike.  Walnut shrimp, salt and pepper chicken and gelato were highlights.  Good value for money."}
{"text":"Lots of variety all great and tasty. Fresh squeezed juice always a plus. Nice to see The Palms coming back up in Vegas. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"The smoked ribs and brisket were phenomenal.  The waitress was nice and sweet, my glass stayed full.  However, the cashiers and hostesses, didn't have a clue.  After waiting for 20-30 minutes, they instructed a few of us into a different line.  Meanwhile, they let everyone that was behind us, to be seated first.  Therefore the people behind us only had to wait approximately 10 minutes vs our 30 minutes.  As soon as I pointed it out, they opened up the flood gates and began seating my neglected group at a quick and frantic pace, like a jail break out. I stated \"Wow you have a bunch of tables open now!  Where were these tables 10 minutes ago?\"  Sometimes you have to get up, stand up, stand up for your rights.  Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight. Soon, the quality will go down hill.  The tender ribs and brisket will blossom into a fond remembrance, when visiting Memory Lane. Unfortunately, this happens to all LV buffets."}
{"text":"First, our waiter was very good.  He gets 4 stars.  The food, 2 stars.  Went for lunch today.  Line at 1pm was quite lengthy. As I am handicapped, our line the wait with 4 people ahead of us took over 15 minutes. The other line could take about an hour.  Once we were seated, up to see the offerings.  I will say almost everything we tasted was either luke warm or cold.  The elote was good, but cold.  The sliders were sitting way too long, buns dried out.  That went to trash, but then they put a new tray our.  It lacked seasoning, no taste at all.  There was no ribs or brisket at lunch.  Just chicken or pulled pork. Overall, I would prefer Green Valley Ranch over AYCE."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet for dinner.  We went twice and the breakfast buffet was not very good, but the dinner buffet was better than the Aria's buffet. (We went there twice also. ). Everything at the AYCE dinner buffet was cooked right and with a lot of flavor. Will definitely go back for the dinner buffet, but not for the breakfast buffet.  Too many older dishes and not much I or my husband liked."}
{"text":"While I am a Phat girl, I am not a fan of buffets. But my oldest son was raving about the selections so we gave it a go. 

Pros: 
 lots of vegetarian choices. 
 some interesting selections like Moroccan lamb - but no pilaf or couscous - and dragonfruit lasagne. 
 bight, clean & a fair amount of staff. 
 dessert bar will make you custom ice cream sandwiches using cookies & a very good selection of made on site, ice cream. 
 pulled pork
 mexican street corn

Cons: 
 very confusing lines to cashier
 rude front of house staff - cashier & hostess. We stood for almost 20 minutes for them to decide which side our party of 4 would be seated at. 5pm on a Friday night when most parties are 4+ 
 no where to sit while waiting for the rest of the party. 
 Selection of food was meh. Typical carving stations, nothing really that stood out. I realize they are only open 1 month but honestly, I thought Station Casinos would have this 
down by now
 they served a Bloody Mary in a CAN & we had to ask for a glass cuz Im \"classy\" 
 food labels were unclear. 
I used my Station card but for 2 of us it was $44something. Obviously not that great of a discount if its 19.99 w/o the card. & the cashier with her rude self, walked away when I asked her. 

We might go back in a few months, once the casino reconstruction is finished. 

Fat girl seating: 5
Large spacious tables & armless chairs."}
{"text":"All of the food is less than decent.  Lower quality product. Pizza tastes like it was frozen. 

1.6/5 stars. My brother says try the other buffets in vegas."}
{"text":"Just had our last meal for Vegas trip at A.Y.C.E.
At Palms. Place is little bit walk or short at ride from main strip but one could not go wrong for price and excellent quality of Buffet food. Each entry is presented nicely with full of flavor. Our server Patricia Toped  it off with excellent service."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews on here I guess I was expecting better. We have been to many buffets in Vegas on and off the Strip. While this buffet is not as expensive as most buffets located on the main Strip, I was not as satisfied. There were about 5 stations, then a station for dessert and another for soup and salad. Each station had very little options and we ended up eating maybe 1 1/2 plates each. The price for 2 kids and 2 adults was $83 or so. I do wish that the kids prices were a little more appropriate as I believe it starts charging kids the same price whether you are 2 or 10 and the cost is almost the same price an adult. Personally, I probably would not come back, they aren't the worst but I would rather pay the additional cost and just go to a different buffet. On a positive note though, free parking and the buffet was easy to find. Also, there was no line to get in."}
{"text":"Excellent food for reasonable price. We stayed here for three days and got bogo for buffet. Love it."}
{"text":"One of a kind buffet..Food and service is amazing! Most definitely recommend to give it a try."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Buffet.  Excellent food quality, staff is friendly and attentive... all that and a great price too!  Check out the Sweet & Light (desserts), all delicious.  Definitely recommended and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch at 11:30. It was a short line waiting but I think it got busier after that so I don't recommend going around noon to one. It's $21.99 a person without a players card but it's $17.99 each person up to 2 people only with a players card. Not bad at all! Most affordable brunch. It includes unlimited mimosa and drinks. Definitely a great deal. The buffet was organize into different stations with labels. I liked how it is set up. They have variety of choices of food. I definitely would come back here again."}
{"text":"The broccoli soup is the best , also great customer service , if you like thanksgiving dinner you'll love it here fresh turkey and mashed potatoes and gravy !! First time here and I'll be back for sure ! Must try buffet and great price !"}
{"text":"I read about the new renovations at Palms Casuno buffet. We came on a Saturday brunch at 3pm $15w/ reward card. The interior looks more country plaid and service people dress in denim w/ suspenders. The ayce is divided in sections. No seafood at all. They have Chinese food, al pastor was good, chicken wings were good too. Weak on greenery area. We stayed till 4pm for dinner to eat bbq ribs, brisket, boil seafood and honey walnut shrimp.  My sister said honey walnut and brisket was very good. Otherwise food is average. The staff are very good on refills on drinks and clearing the tables."}
{"text":"I have eaten at one time or another at all of the Station buffets except GVR. I must say AYCE is by far a better and fresher product. All stations were clean and well presented, and the things I tried were all fresh and tasty. The service was also better that the other Stations. Keep in mind, this is a buffet with fairly quick turnover, it is not a celebrity chef restaurant. With that said, you should not be disappointed unless you are looking for something to complain about."}
{"text":"This buffet was by far one of the best we have had in a long time. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere inviting. The price was fair for what was offered. There were a variety of food offered and everything we had tonight was amazing. The standout dishes were the walnut shrimp, pork panang, cold somen noodles, brussel sprout, asparagus, most definitely the pizza, and the greenery display was inviting.

In addition, the entire time my family and I dined, the Assistant Executive Sous Chef Bell was always on the line ensuring that the line was clean and the production was met. Rarely do you see the AESC on the line working. Our waitress was very attentive and did fabulous job of ensuring that our drinks were topped off and clearing our plates.

Thank you! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Guys, but this buffet isn't worth the time and money.  Dinner was $21.99 with a players card.  We went two weeks ago on a Tuesday evening arriving about 6:30 p.m.  We waited almost 1-1/2 hours to get in...but the kicker is, there were at least six ready-and-waiting tables that were empty plus a high-table with about 10 seats that were totally empty.  We were escorted to the furthest section against the wall.  There was a table for four next to us that was empty the whole time until a few minutes before we left.  We had to ask the waitstaff for spoons, salt, pepper, and refills on our drinks.  She told us that the table wasn't fully set-up because that section was closed off until a short while before we arrived.  What???  Closed???  We waited for almost 1-1/2 hours to be seated.  Why was it closed?  The food was just OK, but we even had to ask for items to be refilled at the salad bar.  The buffet at Gold Coast is right across the street and even though it's not as \"fancy\" the food is better at almost half the price.  When we left at about 8:45 p.m. there were still people in line and we counted eight empty tables on the side we sat at.  Thanks but NO thanks.  We won't be going back.  I guess they spent a LOT of money remodeling but forgot to hire more people and train them to make for a good meal!!  Almost forgot....the music was awful and too, too loud."}
{"text":"The food is not that great, good selection but all the meats taste sweet. The corn on the Cob taste like the frozen corn. The salad bar is very limited. I did like their BBQ meats. The environment is very good and clean."}
{"text":"Fresh food with a good variety. Brisket was really better than expected as was Korean short ribs"}
{"text":"Heard that the Palms hotel redid their buffet so I had to try it out. 

We went during brunch and it wasn't too busy. The interior is modern and they definitely focused on details. 

The food though was just okay. What you would expect from your typical buffet. Not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"the Chinese section n smoke section is amazing, rest is ok, dessert is very good, also got hand made ice cream cookie, made to order"}
{"text":"Was finally able to try this buffet and I just say their vegan and vegetarian options are amazing"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything taste really good and the chicken wings are really good they taste amazing but I just can't wrap my head around this shit while eating the chicken wing"}
{"text":"The newest casino buffet! I believe it's only about 3 weeks old? My husband and I decided to venture off the strip to check it out. I mean.. $20 pp plus tax and tip for all you can eat just sounded too good to be true! 

We arrived at 6 pm and waited about 40 mins to be seated - Enough time for my husband and I to take turn in signing up for palms reward card ($2 off buffet). Once seated, we hurried off to check out their selections. 

There were some trendy options - Cheetos cob of corn, Buffalo Mac and cheese, raclette covered veggies, jackfruit enchiladas. They also offer the classics - prime ribs, bbq, stir frys, and pizzas. The trendy options were fun to try but I ate mainly their pork ribs and briskets (have to pick around for the perfect cut). Apparently they smoke their briskets for 10 hours? The fattier, the tastier! 

Their variety of desserts didn't compare to wicked spoons of course butttt every item they offered was done well. The staff behind the gelato station was the sweetest. Genuinely eager to assist whoever is eyeing the sweet treats. 

Overall - For 1/3 of the strip dinner buffet price - the quality was pretty much the same. The variety might be less (no crab legs, no sushi, no fancy meat cuts) - but $20 pp is a definite steal and well worth a visit."}
{"text":"A.Y.C.E is a good buffet but not 5 star. The food quality is decent but not amazing. The price is pretty cheap compare to other places but there are not that many selections. I was very excited to try sea food and unfortunately the sea food selection was very limited. Everyone were super nice and friendly but I would think twice about the food if I want to go back."}
{"text":"The buffet is a great price and is decorated beautifully and don't get me wrong the food I did eat was tasty but I was disappointed I intended on going for breakfast and at 10 they were already transitioning from breakfast to lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious buffet for the price! My family and I enjoyed our stay in Las Vegas and decided to go to This buffet more than once. I love that three is a good bar with vegan options and the omelette station is a must try! The dessert bar includes gelato and all kinds of desserts as well. Make sure you are show your players card for a discount too."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of dinner buffets, but the reviews were good and I had a 50% off coupon from the Las Vegas Advisor, so why not?  Turnover early on a Wednesday evening was a noticeable issue with some small plates obviously sitting under the heat lamp too long. Equally disappointing was the absences of more ethnic dishes.  Our favorite pair of dishes were the duck cassoulet with white beans (me) and an ambrosia salad (wife). Some dishes just plain did not work, a New England clam boil that included a crawfish, but no clams and a ceviche with almost no identifiable seafood.  Unfortunately for my wife, the highly acclaimed bread pudding was dried out and could not be saved by copious amounts of caramel sauce. Service proved to be above average."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Wednesday was 11:30 am was a 30 minuet wait. The food was good but the prices was not what advertised we had a players card still was $ 34.00 for lunch for two. We will not come back"}
{"text":"18 dollars for all you can eat! How can you Go wrong! Everything was so good with so man different things to choose from. BBQ, Asian, salads, deserts and more
Great service, quick clean up of your old plate and to refill your drinks.  I wish I went there for dinner one night. 
I was expecting a price of 30 plus"}
{"text":"We are locals, we have high expectations. We compare the price and quality from the local casinos. We do not eat on the strip casinos which are for the tourists.

My wife and I used to eat at Palms very frequently before they were remodeled. We ate lunch there recently, so we do not know the quality of the dinner. Most of the foods are not hot and tasteless, especially those with small container or bowels.

First, for value and quality, former Palms Bistro Buffet was much better than the new A.Y.C.E buffet. The old Bistro Buffet had quality salad bar and Italian station. 
Second, compare with the other Station Casinos, We like the Place Station which is cheaper and offers quality foods. Yes, they do not have fancy environment. But for value and quality, we would like to eat there.
Besides, Santa Fe station is also a good choice. Both Palace Station and Santa Fe Station offer better foods than Palms and Red Rock. Red Rock have not changed a dish for many years, unbelievable!

We think the only thing the new A.Y.C.E is better than the old Bistro Buffet is the desserts."}
{"text":"The food was good here. The price was cheap. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"At list it was eatable. Did not see anything in this buffet what you see on the pictures. Simple food, nothing fancy but not overpriced and not over salted."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance is very nice. Interesting selections like ceviche and Mediterranean style apps. 

Had the ribs, brisket, roast beef, mash potatoes, general chicken, honey walnut shrimp. All of which were...ok. Just ok."}
{"text":"Probably the best price for the buffet and very delicious food and a great price, place and value"}
{"text":"Why not name an All You Can Eat buffet \"A.Y.C.E. Buffet\"? This is the newest buffet in Vegas as they opened their doors on 12/22/17. It's located in the Palms Casino Resort. Price of buffet depends on your player card status. $2 off if you're minimum Good Card status. Alcoholic drinks are an extra charge. Juice, soft drinks and coffee is included. We came here for breakfast so the buffet was only $10.99/person. Lunch is $13.99/person and dinner is $19.99/person. 

There are many stations that you pick food from. When you are walked over to your table, a server comes up to take your drink orders. They came around several times to refill the drinks for us and clear out empty or finished plates. Excellent customer service for a buffet. The miso soup, hash browns, country fried steak, sausage, ham and OJ were good. Pulp was in the OJ which was nice. I was definitely not a fan of their pot stickers. Only Asian item I enjoyed was the miso soup. There was also an omelette station which was very popular."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and the food was amazing!!'  Very high quality and cooked to perfection.  The deserts are very well done.  I would highly recommend a trip to the Palms even if just for the buffet."}
{"text":"This was a waste of  My husband and I came in for lunch on a Saturday. I'm a pescatarian, very little seafood here. Food looks like it has been sitting. Dessert is frozen, dinner rolls are hard. This was a disappointment 
."}
{"text":"Second time here, disappointed! No more tuna and salmon poke, duck over cooked, cream burlee too sweet and so on and so on. Last time I rated five stars, to night no more than three stars. Willing to give it another try a few weeks from now."}
{"text":"The food was ok.
Our service from Lakresha was what made three stars. She was sweet, attentive and the best. 

Best thing on buffet was veggie egg rolls and Turkey wings

Would i return? No.."}
{"text":"Best value Buffett in Vegas. PERIOD.
They could use some better service and some quicker seating.... Waited in line for 30 minutes with an empty restaurant.... Very annoying...

But value baby, value."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour at grand opening day. To be honest Palms needed this buffet so badly because their food court sucks! Their food court loaded with fast food and food that doesn't have any carb in it. 
We went for lunch and price was $13.79 per person which is not so bad. 

Food 
They offer a lot of snacks, meals, salad bar, ice cream and dessert bar, but fruits selection is not big only honeydew and pineapple (very poor choice of fruits ), also I didn't saw beef anywhere. 

Drinks 
They have drinks which waiters available to provide. For alcohol beverages one has to pre-pay. 

Sweets
I tried desserts and ice cream for me it's too sweet and not tasty seems to be artificial flavored. 

Overall experience 4-/5 but it could be better. I tried to come at dinner but wasn't ready to wait another hour in queue. They need to improve their coordination and assist in reducing the queue faster. We noticed that there were a lot of empty tables while people where waiting for hours to get their table."}
{"text":"Went with friends, with the mindset of \"need to get there ASAP before quality goes down like Wicked Spoon.\"

Don't know if it was the mindset, but the service was not the best so that could have overshadowed everything.

Don't get me wrong, the buffet looks great. Design of the space looks amazing. Very open. Nice and bright.

From the moment we stood in line, the expectations were already lowering. The woman in charge of the line took us out of the line we were at and moved us to the next register, where if she kept us, our group of 7 would've gotten in sooner. Instead, the group after us in the original line got through first.

When our group of 7 was sat, we immediately went straight for the food.

Pros: corn bread (stayed moist), walnut shrimp (retained some crunch and not overly sweet), individual wedge salad (lettuce was not oxidized and fresh no brown or wilted), cooked to order pasta, smoked brisket (flavorful and tender), carved turkey breast (moist), prime rib, coque au vin, mini macarons (ordered out), lemon tart (nice tart flavor)

Cons: turkey legs (dry), shrimp cocktail (shrimp texture was off and cocktail sauce was not like other station property- had no bite or body, loose), collard greens (no ham/ham hock), individualized clam bake (overcooked crawfish and other shellfish), pan seared salmon (overcooked), catfish (soaked up the liquid it was sitting in to prevent it from drying out),  tuna poke bowl (tuna didn't look fresh and very oxidized, no red \"fresh\" color,\" every other individualized desserts (lack luster, didn't know I could ever eat a \"watered\" down espresso flavor, but I did while my friend ate the same thing and his had way stronger espresso flavor)

Service: server kept forgetting our drink order refills. As part of the Station Culture: \"It's Everyone's Job,\" the busser was not very helpful. Our table asked him for help with refills and the response was typical \"union\" response: \"I'll let your server know.\" I'm sorry,  dinner rush was finished,  plenty of tables were still clean and open and the time we asked he only had 2 4-tops to bus, so we didn't understand the brush off. ...

All in all, probably won't go back for dinner. But if you must try, at least get the Boarding Pass to get the discount. I normally go crazy at buffets, doing 4+ rounds, but this time I didn't go past 2."}
{"text":"Breakfast was included in our stay at the Palms.
Saturday we came about 9:00 AM which seemed to be the perfect timeframe. No line!

Much to choose from. Station offered:  Roastery, Greenery, Hearth, World Pan, Smoke & Fire, Sweet & Light, and Revival. Revival station is \"wellness, power-boosting super foods & specialty vegan & vegetarian. World Pan include Moroccan lamb, congee, bao buns, and strogonoff, while the Roastery has installed a white oak and mesquite chip burning grill. 

Restaurant is clean, staff is organized by getting the line moving & assisting guest. Employees handling the stations are prompt and professional. Please tip the wait staff. They work hard in providing good customer service, keeping your table cleaned off, getting your drinks replenished and catering to your needs.

BTW: Sunday brunch is an additional fee. However, included in the price is endless Mimosas & available from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m."}
{"text":"Since the Palms casino was sold to Stations, transformations have been happening around the resort.  Their buffet is one of them.  I recall the place was dull, small and forgettable.  But A.Y.C.E. changed that with an expensive makeover and completely new menu. 

The entrance is more dramatic with high ceilings and its name is bright lights. Stations are named to sound more like a description (ie. Smoke & Fire or Sweet & Light) 

Food are mostly served in smaller portions now, similar to Wicked Spoon. This is a kid ch better practice for people to sample more types, while cutting down on waste, I hope.  

Food wasn't outstanding in any way but good enough to satisfy.  Small poke bowl; fresh but bland. Salt & pepper wings; flavor was good but I got a piece that was undercooked. Sliders were very dry and well done. These are just a few that needs improvement. Other than these, the food was good enough for us not to complain but not great to be memorable. 

A big plus for me is they have hand scooped ice cream. They also serve cookies and premise ice cream sandwiches. Or you can create your own. Other desserts were also in smaller portions. 

Our server was great. Wish I remember her name but she's an older Filipino lady.  They also did a good job keeping things full.  

I can't believe I didn't know about A.Y.C.E. last time we stayed at Palms Place but there's a pretty good chance we'll go back.  3.5 stars for this new buffet. 

Tips: 

Prices are dependent on your level of Player's Card. Or if you don't have one, regular price isn't that bad at under $15 for lunch. 

If you like macrons & they don't have any on display, try asking.  If there are any left, they'll grab it for you.  

Lines aren't too bad earlier, before noon.  It does get busier after 12:30ish.  

Don't be a cheapskate, tip your server. Two gals next to us didn't tip at all. Lame. 

See my photos and give them a 'like'!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best buffet places in Vegas that I have been to. Not only is the quality of food really good but also the price is very reasonable. Our server is great as well. I will definitely consider going back there on my future trip."}
{"text":"Great option for people staying at The Palms, good option for people staying on The Strip & wanting a somewhat upscale buffet without having to pay $30+ per person.

As a vegetarian, the \"Revival\" section of vegan/vegetarian food was a little underwhelming in terms of options, but what they had was good, and the other food type/style sections each usually had at least one vegetarian dish that I could have.

As a local living in Henderson. When I want a decent buffet (with a better salad bar) at a decent price, I expect I'll continue to visit the buffets Green Valley Ranch & Sunset Station instead.


Not included in the normal buffet price, A.Y.C.E. does have a couple nice beer options, and also has wine & mixed-drinks available.

I overheard a customer in line ask about seafood -- as of now, there is no seafood station.  There are a few minor seafood options at some of the stations.   Depending on how things go & customer requests, etc. they will \"study adding a seafood station at a later date.\""}
{"text":"One word: Scruptious.  We went to Sunday all you can eat/drink brunch and was flawed by the gourmet menu.  From sushi to omelettes and all in between a $20 dollar bill goes wild for selection"}
{"text":"Place is just as good as wicked spoon at almost half the price, can never go wrong here. Staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Most excellent buffet.  We went twice in two days.  Clean saw no one smoking. Great restrooms great service.   I ate sushi while family had breakfast  

Well Maintained  place nothing broken or missing"}
{"text":"A step up from the normal Station Casino Feast buffet.  Modern, bright and clean.  Flavors were good on most items I tried.  Vegetarian options available if needed.  Mushroom Quesadilla was great!  Walnut shimp, balsamic brussel sprouts, brisket, carne asada, elotes, shrimp cocktail and ceiveche are among other notable srand outs.  Really enjoyed the freshness of the \"greenery\" station. Wedge salad was nice and pesto mozzarella was super fresh. 

Cons: Poke bowls rice was dry. Korean short ribs were tough. 

Try the macaroons!
 I will be back...hoping for some coupons!!"}
{"text":"Man me and my boyfriend are always trying new places and today we tried this place. You want good food that is strip quality but off the strip prices this is your place. We will be making this our new spot"}
{"text":"The best buffet in Vegas. The price is unbeatable. The quality of the food is great. It's always fresh. The service is extra amazing. Especially Rhonda she is the bees knees."}
{"text":"Line was sooo long! So with a line being that long you would think the food was great, right? Wrong. It wasn't that great at all. I would compare it to your average \"local\" buffet that you would pay $9 for dinner. Selections are minimal and what they do have, well...weren't very good. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"The newest buffet to appear in the valley is A.Y.C.E. at the Palms.  As the Station Casino's flagship hotel/resort, you can expect the re-vision of your budget buffet to make a big splash and AYCE didn't disappoint!

We skipped the hour and a half wait and opted for a late dinner at 9:20PM.  No line.  No wait.  

Their grill bar serves up prime rib and short ribs that are tender and tasty.  I liked their gumbo and pea soup, while my wife raved about the penang soup.  Desert bar is off the chain.

For Station Casino card members, dinner will run you a measly $17.99.  

Ask for Patricia's section - this 12 year Las Vegan and NYC native is a delight to chat with."}
{"text":"Man oh man, for $20 this is so worth the price shrimp , steak , prime rib. Amazing desserts. 
I can't wait to have family visiting to take them to this buffet. 
I'm so happy station casinos took ownership, they're doing amazing things if this is the start. 
If you ever been to wicked spoon this is just like it with the price not being $60 dollars. I should've taken pictures. But I was so hungry I just stuffed my face."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Brunch and it was great!! It cost a little more than we expected but with our players card we got $10 off, it was great . Our server was Salvator and he was so nice. The food was great , it had such a great choice of foods. I am a Southern girl and I love me some biscuits and gravy and their gravy was just like I am use to it was so good. Will be going back soon to try lunch"}
{"text":"Visiting the newly renovated Palms buffet, now known as A.Y.C.E.

Price definitely swaying even the most modest eaters, starting around $8.99 for breakfast and dinner only $17.99 with a players card, it's a steal in comparison to your on strip options at a similar or better quality!

We were coming in at 11am, and therefore some breakfast items had one foot out the door, while new lunch items were showing up on each visit to the line.  A bit exciting to see new variety at each round, although most was due to schedule I am sure.

As with any buffet, you'll likely find many hits and some misses, but my experience leaned towards the former throughout!

Give it a go!"}
{"text":"I tried the breakfast, dinner, and then Sunday brunch. Overall the food was very good. I met the head chef who was watching the front line and was very focused on quality and any special request. I tried as many items as I could and overall give this place a big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch which featured bottomless mimosas all for $22 dollars total instead of the regular $13 week day breakfast price. 

There are a lot of food options, not just an egg/bacon/sausage/bread breakfast spread which was nice, however, I was disappointed in the quality of food. I tried a little bit of almost everything they had and the meat was overcooked and tough as was the case with a lot of their other dishes. I was excited to see they had shrimp, but they tasted freshly defrosted....they had a wet, soggy half frozen taste to them which was not pleasant at all.  I did not enjoy 85% of the food I tried at this buffet and that is very sad to me. The dessert was very good though and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"What a difference!
This used to be a very average buffet but now that Stations owns this place.... They've  been slowly upgrading everything and they put their magic touch on this buffet. 

The food options are great!
Service is great!
Ambiance is great!

The brisket, ribs, sautéed broccoli and brussel sprouts were all on point.  They have a great dessert station too.  

For those with special diets...
They offer vegan desserts and vegan food options.  Gluten free options too.


Stations Players card gets a small discount too."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite off-strip buffet. The restaurant is newly renovated,brightly lit space with plaid & leather interiors.it was done well.

I went on their Saturday brunch, the variety of food is fair, but I can say that each food item is excellent(taste and presentation).  I would definitely go back. 

Value for money  is. 5stars."}
{"text":"Beautiful buffet with comfortable seating arrangements. The food is delicious as well plus a yummy selection of ice cream that they serve for you!  

Now let's talk about the main event! And this is not the food, it's about the employees in that location! Great customer service from every one that I spoke to. One in specific is Wendy! Everyone, if possible, ask for Wendy to be your server/waitress! She is fantastic! I believe she must be a coach to all the servers  if she isn't, she MUST be made ASAP! Quick at refilling your drink, take plates away, on top of it all! She would refer us certain combinations with food! Thank you Wendy for your great service!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Tasty and unique menu items served tapas style in many cases.  Several foods had you coming back for seconds and thirds

At $18 per person (with casino membership) for dinner it was a real bargain

Will definitely go back again and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Tried this buffet last Thursday night, based on the Yelp reviews. The last couple of buffets we went to were Aria and Bellagio, so our bar is pretty high as far as buffets go, but this place definitely impressed us. And factor in that it was ~$22/person (without the player's card) and you got yourself a darn good deal of a buffet. 

The food was very good. Actually, their honey walnut shrimp was awesome! Our favorite version is the one at Panda Inn in Pasadena, and these were pretty gosh darn close to it! The shrimp were... shrimpier and less walnuts, but for the price, I'll take it! Husband tried the brisket and it was tough, assuming because it probably sat around a bit, but he got another one when a new batch came out and he said that was much better. 

The French onion soup was salty.. which I find it to be the case more often than not with that soup, but not bad.

Service was great.. she kept the refills flowing, and kept our table clear of dirty plates. Great ambiance and clean too. Definitely a great option if you're in a buffet state of mind."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with wide open spaces, food choices not to my liking, tho! Only really neat thing for me personally was the desserts, Raspberry tea and the Chinese food was pretty good.  Their food in general seemed made from scratch! Their Gelato was not The best, I've  tasted.   The wait staff was excellent and that alone deserves 5 Stars!! I really commend the wait staff and I happen to meet the manager of the Buffet, Kai...she is an A+ person, graceful and courteous.  I would recommend this one just for the atmosphere, very pleasing to the eyes, food is made fresh with nice popular choices. Their different stations were clean/neat, gelato choice is an extra bonus. A lot of delicious fresh fruit and nuts in many many varieties as well as dinner rolls....All in all a good choice for brunch!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here.  First time was the first week they opened around lunchtime. Food was mediocre and everything was tepid temperature.  A few months later let's try Sunday brunch. Price for what it wasn't was a waste of money. Very underwhelmed by choices. Again the temperature of the food was not even warm.  That is a huge no, no in the food industry and a turn off for me when eating any food that should be at least moderately hot. So let's skip brunch food and get dessert for breakfast.  Ice cream sandwich looked good but the cookie holding the ice cream was so damn hard by the time you could jackhammer It with your teeth the ice cream would slip out of the cookies. The fruit was good. I gave it a fair shot A.Y.C.E. buffet."}
{"text":"I was just there the other night to try the \"new\" buffet.   After standing in line for 45 minutes in a human maze to be $19.99 each (from my understanding it's 21.99 without boarding pass,  19.99 with red boarding pass and 17.99 for yellow or higher boarding pass, which I had but was charged a different amount regardless).  After being seated,  you will notice that you get an \"A.Y.C.E.\" pre-reprinted paper napkin (one per person and you will receive another one napkin per person if you ask nicely during your meal.   All alcohol is charged separately from your meal, so keep that in mind when your deciding what beverage you want to order and order 2 because the service for refills is slow to none.  The salad bar was nice,  just be careful with the sneeze guard because of you're over 5'6\", you will have a hard time reaching the back row of salad condiments, having to go in blind, fumbling for a spoon and hoping you've grabbed the bacon and not beets because you're nor able to reach and look at the same time(I had a difficult time and the attendant was even trying to help me reach because the sneeze guard is positioned really low) although the shrimp cocktail in little buckets was a nice touch but the soups were still the same as anything you'd find at a fiesta buffet.   The was a cold slab they used to keep these small dishes of poke chilled.  It was really neat to see but its so much waste of rice because the rice was what was being chilled, causing it to dry out and get crunchy.   If you're down for cold, dry and crunchy rice with 2 pieces of raw fish on top,  then you'll like this. THis dish wasn't well thought out but it was nice to see though.   I tried a lot of flavors and the pizza area seemed to be consistant, not the best ever eaten but more palatable then some.   The rest of the buffet was the same as any station.   They dressed up their flavorless mac n  cheese into single serving dishes with bread crumbs and processed swiss cheese shavings on top(a generic box from winco had the same flavor... move along there's nothung to see here).  The marinara sauces tasted fermented(spoiled) and led me to think certain dishes were overcooked and an after thought to get rid of quick by placing it on the line.  This buffet is not and holds no flame to any strip buffet.   It holds no flame to green valley ranch.   It does keep up with red rock and the rest of the stations only the presentation and plating is what makes you think it's new and improved.   I had high hopes that for the price they are charging that this buffet would shine.   It's not worth the effort.   And I'm deeply disappointed.  They spent so much money on napkin printing instead of quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Cheap and plenty of varieties! They change the dishes too.. so it's like a surprise every time!"}
{"text":"Great food but they changed the menu for Easter and that was a bummer but they do have ice cream and chocolate strawberry's but I think the chocolate strawberry's are occasionally there."}
{"text":"Now in its third month of operation and still doing good volume, opening during the holidays a smart move that allowed early kinks to be resolved before convention season, Friday night found A.Y.C.E. Buffet at The Palms particularly busy with a broad mix of patrons including Body Builders, Locals and tourists in town to watch the Final Four.

Currently celebrating Passover with a variety of traditional Jewish dishes in addition to the 'usual' items described as a \"celebration of All-You-Can-Eat,\" seven stations spread over a sizable footprint divided by cooking method and concept, it was just prior to 6:00pm that three guests arrived before the rush and found quick seating at a banquet near \"World Pan,\" everyone taking a moment to peruse the choices and plate number one comprised of Walnut Prawns every bit as good as what one will find on Spring Mountain Road plus spicy Noodles and respectable General Tso's Chicken.

Again impressed by such a radical departure from Station Casinos' Feast brand of Buffet, everything from the décor to individual servings rivaling the standard set by Caesars' Bacchanal or Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, it was working with small portions that plates two and three took a look at several of the  Passover options plus a Dinner Roll and surprisingly light French Macarons, the Chopped Liver rich and creamy while Matzo Brei, Soup and Stuffing were all pleasant, though limited personal experience prevents comment as to whether others would think they were great.

Executed under the direction of Chef Joseph Kudrak, his time with Station Casinos at Red Rock earning him a role overseeing Palms Casino Resort as a whole, it was with plate four that the first misfire of the evening arrived in the form of watery Lasagna with overly sweet Sauce, the Stromboli and smoked Ratatouille a far better example of A.Y.C.E.'s Italian offerings while the French Onion Soup topped in gooey Cheese is also worth a taste.

Taking a look at the Roastery plus Smoke & Fire next, sliced-to-order Roast Beef faring better than chewy smoked Brisket while Ribs, Turkey and Morrocan Lamb Stew were all better than one might ever expect at a Buffet, those avoiding Meat will be happy to know that Herb Roasted Cauliflower, Mushroom Quesadillas and Cornbread are all very good while the layered pan of Jack Fruit Enchiladas may just be the best savory item on the whole Buffet. 

Priced at just $21.99 for Dinner, Station's Boarding Pass saving each guest $4, Dessert offers a whole island of items that shifts from morning to evening, the aforementioned Macarons as good as what is offered at the end of a meal at Le Cirque while miniature Carrot Cake, Cheesecake Parfaits, Lemon Meringue Tarts and Vegan Coconut Cookies all stand out amongst a collection that even goes so far as to account for dietary restrictions such as Sugar or Gluten Free.

Wrapping up with made-to-order Cookie Sandwiches plus three large-format Desserts, the Apple Cobbler and Fudge Brownie both nice landing pads for Soft Serve plus a variety of toppings, it warrants repeating that no visit to A.Y.C.E. should end without a heaping scoop of Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding plus or minus Ice Cream, Gelato or Caramel because save for *perhaps* what is offered at The Kitchen at Atomic there is none better in Sin City...and theirs is $8 a slice.

****1/2:  Sure some will point out the lack of (thin, frozen) Crab Legs or U20+ Shrimp, but at less than 1/2 the price and 1/4 the wait for Bacchanal or Wynn it speaks volumes of Chef Kudrak and his team that only two of fifty items tasted from A.Y.C.E.'s Dinner Buffet were disappointing while several were good enough that they could be menu items elsewhere - including Restaurants charging double on The Strip."}
{"text":"Wow! AYCE is a really really awesome buffet. Affordable price (dinner is $17.99 per person), great food, and friendly service. The highlights were the duck, brisket, cornbread. But great diversity of food and the taste is great for a buffet. The dessert was also amazing. The macaroons, gelato, and carrot cake were the best thing I had at desserts. Can't say enough good things about this buffet."}
{"text":"This review is based on a weekday breakfast only. Rarely if ever i give 4 stars to a $14 breakfast but this place really is a hidden gem.

Location: at the Palms casino resort, its kind of out of the way, not near any monorail stations, we had to lyft from the convention center.

Ambience: new, clean and comfortable, open dining areas with a casino view.

Service: excellent, attentive to details. Perhaps it was due to our great server Wendy? Out coffee was always refilled to the brim, even the dining napkins were aligned perfectly on the table with the restaurant logo facing you. 

Food: they dont offer any exotic or expensive items here, but using simple fresh local ingredients to come up with creative, fun & artistic eats.  Has vegetarian & gluten free selections.
Coffee: it was actually good, less bitter less acidic than most places, smooth although flavor not as strong, perhaps dark roast? Almost but not quite as good as the coffees in Japan.
Fresh pressed juices: served in cute shot glasses, its what this place is known for, today it was lemon, i downed 4 of those even though i am not a lemon fan. It was that good.

Actual food: very creative & fun, small servings in cute mini containers: smoked brisket egg benedict, tapioca fruit parfait (excellent), egg white fritatta, chilled glazed tofu (smooth), pina colada fritters, self serving/mixing cold ramen noodle station ( light & flavorful), made to order omelette station was good, gluten free pancake was very dry & a bit hard, bacons were not very enticing, they were dry and lean and in smaller pieces instead of whole strips?perhaps they cut away the fat portions?

Price: $14 each including tax. If u r a member its only $9. 

Conclusion: AYCE breakfast at Palms is now one of my new favorites at Vegas. Great bang even for a loser's budget. Simple yet delicious food that are fun & creative. Its unfortunate that its off the beaten path, otherwise there will be a line out the door."}
{"text":"For the cheap buffet price in Vegas. This buffet is totally worth it. I would suggest to come for their lunch instead of breakfast. Since the buffet has less selection compare to other buffers in Vegas already. Breakfast is even less. My favorite would be their corn with hot chitos. Very clever dish. The fresh cut meat is very dry so I don't recommend it but others are not so bad. If you are coming for a five star meal I wouldn't recommend to come here since the food display is much better than it taste like. Also, do keep in mind that you may have to wait for long time to get seated."}
{"text":"You would probably have better quality food in the dumpster out back. I found a hair in my sweet potatoes and the salad was all wilted. I really didn't enjoy much of Vegas today because I have been sick from the meat. How do I know it's the meat? Because I have been belching it up all day. If you really dig hanging near a bathroom all day I highly suggest eating this awful food."}
{"text":"I saw reviews of the AYCE on YouTube and it looked really good but you never know until you actually try it.
I actually loved the buffet, I usually avoid all Vegas buffets since most are either way over priced and mass-produced or just horrible. I've been to almost every buffet in Las vegas. So far for the price and food quality this is the best one currently. 

I actually saw the chefs make the food in the kitchen it seems nothing was brought from outside sources. I also saw the chefs blow torching the creme brulee. 

I'd say 90% of the food I ate was top notch. Only thing I didn't like was the salmon poki avoid it I felt it was inedible. The smoked pork ribs, smoked brisket and everything in the Asian section was awesome. They also had a decent vegetarian section too. They had roasted cauliflower in the carving section for slicing.

The dessert section was top notch, hand made ice cream sandwiches, creme brulee, gelato, also french macaroons. 

The best part of the buffet was how fresh everything was nothing was sitting around and old food. I read some of the reviews and I don't see how some people say it was bad. The buffet is not the biggest in Vegas like baacanal at Caesars but it's about quality and I think palms delivers.

Big tip: this is one of the buffets without a gap between lunch and dinner so you can walk in at 3:45pm pay lunch price and get dinner food that starts at 4pm.

 I originally rated this buffet 5 stars but I first went to this buffet on a Thursday and then went back Sunday for dinner again but the quality had gone down which lead me to believe that the buffet is inconsistent
In quality. When I went back again the dessert section was not very good as it was before, it seems their ice cream fridge went on a blink and the ice cream looked very melted. There also was no creme brulee and no french macaroon like few days before. This is disturbing since it was so good the first time I went. I still have to say the Asian section is very good, all the flavors pop."}
{"text":"The Palms updated their buffet and it was actually pretty good. My family and I kept hearing about it and seeing it on TV, so we tried it for Sunday Brunch. The Palms is now a Station Casino, and it's better than all the other Station Casinos I've been too. 

They offer different dishes that you don't usually see in other Station Casinos.
It looks like they are trying to match Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan with their servings, but it was no match for Wicked Spoon. However, it was still good and I'll probably come back sometime."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a super affordable buffet that has actually good food (and not only just a wide variety of food), come here. 

We walked by this place while going around the casino. We stayed in the Palms Place so we were really close to here. An Uber driver recommended this place to us. And, based on my experience, when a local Uber driver recommends a place, you at least check it out.

The staff were super friendly and let us do a quick walk around before purchasing a buffet. We looked, we smelled, we got in line.

We stayed for the breakfast buffet, so I can only speak about that, but for about $10ish dollars a person, we couldn't believe that the food could be that good. I'm so glad we were wrong.

I usually think of buffets as \"a bunch of average food that makes up for the average taste with the overwhelmingly quantity\". This one, however, has a huge variety AND tastes great AND is super affordable. Seriously, this may be the best breakfast buffet I've ever had.

Overall, because of the clean environment, classy decor, tasty food, wide variety of food, friendly staff, & extremely affordable price, I'd say it's worth a shot. 

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if their prices go up soon. This is easily a $30-40/person buffet at a $10ish price. 

The only question I have for you now is: Will you be able to try all the foods you want to try here before you get full? 

I almost did. Almost."}
{"text":"Food was terrible 
No options 
Staff was friendly 
Paid $16 for lunch was trying for the breakfast but missed it"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time and meal at A.Y.C.E buffet. I am sure that the price will go up after it has established its name and the remodeling has completed. Guarantee. 

The walk from the strip to Palms is about 20 minutes and it may not be pleasant on hot, cold, or rainy days. We were looking to take the shuttle between Bally's and Rio before walking over to Palms but when I got to the hotel, I was told that the shuttle was closed. When did that happen? Anyway, we walked and were glad that the food was excellent. I ate like a teenager again. They might have lost money on me."}
{"text":"We went for brunch buffet Sunday morning at 9 AM. We were staying at the hotel. Sunday morning buffet, as it is automatically brunch, is more expensive than normal buffet breakfast. Instead of roughly 9 dollars per person, it is a little over $23 per person. Includes bottomless Mimosa or champagne, which are OK, yet to get your moneys worth, you need to be a drinker or just not worth it.
The food was average to a few items below average. Nothing was memorable and there is nothing I would want to try again. It is probably one of the lower end quality buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas. I am comparing it to higher end hotels though.
We felt that because we had a two for one buffet certificate, it was OK. We would not have been happy had we had to pay the full price per person, because it simply isn't worth that much.
Getting there at 9 AM on Sunday was perfect for us because there was no line. When we left around 10:30 AM, having taken our time, the line was very long to get into the buffet.
Otherwise, it was just OK. I will say that it is an upgrade from the old buffet when it was under different hotel management. Therefore, it has improved, yet very average."}
{"text":"Came to eat dinner here last night and I brought my daughter with me . They didn't have the Thai curry mussels but it was ok this buffet is so good best I've been to off the strip. I recommend to try it at least once. The turkey wings with bbq sauce mmmm. Im big fan of their macaroni station anything u like to put in it and they cook right there . Must try!!! My daughter love the dessert station of course !!"}
{"text":"The price is definitely cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. Food quality is just average that nothing really stands out. The quality of the carving station was especially bad. The meats including beef, pork and turkey all tasted super dry and rubbery. Everything from the dessert station look like was bought from store. One of the only few thing I enjoyed was the make your own omelet during brunch time. Line was long and it moved slow despite having so many empty tables. Our server also pretty much disappeared after getting our first drinks."}
{"text":"Wow so I have waited over an hour in line for brunch. They are completely understaffed. Once I finally got to the front of the line the cashier just let some random couple cut me. Talking about how they had been waiting so have I we are all in the same line. Seriously disappointed they didn't have it together better than this. The sausage I had was cold, the carved meats were very dry, the only thing I enjoyed was the French toast. I didn't even see my server again until I was finished eating. Just a pretty poor experience all around. I feel like the staff dropped the ball on this one."}
{"text":"If you can give .5 stars on reviews this would be a 3.5/5....

Price is super cheap compared to the buffets on the main strip and a few dollars more than what you would find at your local stations casino.

I feel for the price of it you do get a lot for your money and that is why I reflected it as 4 instead of 3 stars but at the same time you do get the quality of food that you pay for so don't expect everything to be perfect or fresh tasting.

I went for dinner but overall especially for breakfast you can't beat this value"}
{"text":"It's Lent.  It's Friday, 16 February 2018.  It's lunch.  What? No New England Clam Chowder.  It's blasphemy.  It's UN-American.  Even in China they have clam chowder on Fridays.  If you had zero stars, that is what I would rate today.  Treason!!!"}
{"text":"Got a mailer offering 2-for-1 breakfast buffet. Decided to come in to use it on a Sunday. After waiting in line for a half hour, we right next to the couple ahead of us who pulls out THEIR 2-for-1 mailer and gets told that they aren't accepting today. Sure enough, at the very bottom in very small print, they have something about how it's not good on Sunday. I wonder how many other people the cashier had to explain the fine print to. It makes me feel straight up cheated. I live very close to this place and would have been a regular, but they lost me for good. Completely ruined my morning."}
{"text":"I watched the reviews and decided to go to this place with friends for Saturday dinner. But both me and my friends  were disappointed with the choice. I usually don't go buffet very often, the only buffet  I went to recrntly was M hotel, about half month ago, compared to M hotel, the selection was half , the food quality was so so, the roast beef should be the best, but the walnuts shirmp which was a side was  the best to me. Besides that one , everything else is just ok, some of them were below my average expectations.
I also watched the video \" all you can Vegas\" before, but there was indeed fewer choices than the video showed. Only the dessert meet. 
The service were  nice, the people were friendly.
Overall, I won't go there again even though the price is cheap. If you just want to eat and finish fast them go somewhere else , it may be a good choice."}
{"text":"The Best Buffet in Town!!!  Food quality is outstanding and the service is Amazing!!!  This buffet will change how you view buffets!"}
{"text":"okay it's not the Wicked Spoon, but the price was reasonable and some of the offerings like the beef brisket were awesome."}
{"text":"I came around 12pm Food tasted old like it's been sitting out for a while. I think it was the food from the night before. And there were not that many items available. I gave it a 3 because my waiter was super helpful."}
{"text":"Its the best Champagne sunday brunch in town. They accommodated my group of 16 with ease, especially Assistant Manager, Mary & her staff. The selection of food are great & served in small quality portion."}
{"text":"This is probably the best buffet I've ever eaten at. Everything tasted so fresh and flavorful! I honestly did not want to leave! So many options! We went for dinner and nothing disappointed us! Everything was clean. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely be making this a must every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This buffet has taken the buffet standard to a new underwhelming low. The selections are über confusing to the point where you're lost in food translation. Their stations don't go by the typical buffet naming scheme, like Asian, American and International Flavors, their naming scheme goes like  \"The Revival\" and \"Hearth\". The only saving grace for their buffet is the carving stations and pizza. I personally prefer Bristo Buffet over this underwhelming reimagining. 

Their food selections aren't really great, to begin with, it's very limited and subpar, compared to other cheap buffets that I've eaten at. I expected that the food quality would be better, as I was told by a customer service telephone operator a couple of days prior to going to A.Y.C.E. Buffet, however, I've expected wrong. Bistro Buffet had the essential buffet favorites that it needed, such as typical Asian cuisine dishes, Fried Rice and Chow Mein, which is a staple for all casino buffets. I found myself a couple of times, moving back and forth by the buffet line, wondering what am I going to plate and bring to my table to eat. Yes, you can call me a slight picky eater, but looking at the selection presented to me, can you blame me?

My other issue is the Cashiers and Ushers, my mom and I stood in line on our first day there, along with other patrons for almost an hour, before we got to the cashiers. What I'm trying to allude to is that the Cashiers and Ushers are slow to allow the line to progress forward. I saw cashiers, just stand around and/ or count their day's take in the register drawer, when they should focus on getting patrons through the line and seated. I've seen many people who were a few minutes before my us, not stay to eat, they've left and requested their refunds. It's not worth $12.00 plus taxes to eat at a place that doesn't provide a variety of food selections, especially when the selections are confusing or unlabeled.

Palms Resort and Casino is a member of the Station Casino family, they should have built a buffet that matches the successful buffets of such hotels like Green Valley and Red Rock Resorts. Management of the Palms should have studied what makes Feast Buffets so successful and they should have emulated it with their buffet. I understand that Palms wants to set themselves apart from their sister hotels, by providing an alternative, but let's be real here for a second, has their previous buffet proven itself to be a success?..... Maybe, when they were an independently owned entity, however, today they aren't. Bistro Buffet wasn't a huge success, but it was the Palms buffet for many years, despite the ever-changing times and trends. 

The reason that Bistro Buffet stayed as the Palms chosen buffet is that it provided its hungry patrons the familiar buffet favorites and it didn't confuse them with eclectic station names. It was easy to understand where to go if you wanted a certain dish or cuisine, if you wanted Asian dishes, you go to the Asian station, if you wanted American, you go to American and so forth. I have a feeling that A.Y.C.E. Buffet won't be a successful hit with its current confusing and limited food selection. The Palms should rethink how they do buffets and change how A.Y.C.E. Buffet works. If they're going with the theme of \"All You Can Eat\", the food should reflect that, with their limited and portioned out selections, it defeats the purpose of the theme of \"All You Can Eat\".

As the buffet was transitioning from lunch to dinner, there wasn't anybody standing in line to wait for dinner at A.Y.C.E. Buffet, it was their second day since they opened. I understand that the line will slowly form, but normally at a buffet like Feast or MGM Buffets, as they transition inside, there is already a line forming outside. The line should have started to form a half an hour to 45 minutes prior to opening for the next meal time. A.Y.C.E. Buffet is going to see empty lines happen, if they continue to operate like this. If they don't want to see empty lines outside their buffet and survive, they should change how they do buffets.

I personally don't and won't recommend any of my family and friends to eat here. Like how I said earlier, it's not worth $12.00 per person (if you have a station casino players card) $14.00 per person (without the station players card). It's better to go to the Red Rock and eat there, because it's a \"Feast\" style of buffet, a true \"All You Can Eat\" buffet. Yes, it's a bit of a drive if you don't live near the Red Rock and it's a bit pricey, however, it's all worth it in the end, you'll end up leaving with a highly filled and satisfied stomach. Knowing that you've truly had a true All-You-Can-Eat experience at the Feast Buffet.

I know that the Palms is trying to cater to a certain demographic, but that's not what they should do, they should cater to every demographic. Which A.Y.C.E. Buffet doesn't do, unfortunately, with their eclectic and limited food selections."}

{"text":"Mediocre at most. Party of 13, 5 adults, 3 tweens (9,10,12) and 5 kids under 4, they charged for 2 years and over bill was 195$ including gratuity. We didn't even get a table together it was basically 2 tables with 3 chairs against the  wall the high chairs seperated the tables so I couldn't even talk with the rest of my party. Should have just said 2 seperate parties and saved us the 35$ tip. Didn't even have any seafood but some fried cod and assorted sushi. I enjoyed fiesta casino more and its cheaper!!"}

{"text":"Got in early Sunday morning around 9 am and immediately got seated. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our needs were met. The place was very clean, airy, well lit and decor was modern and contemporary. Tables were set with adequate room between them so you don't bump into other people as you go back and forth from the buffet line. As far as the food, they were all served fresh at the right temperature, presentation was great and all were delicious. At this time, this is my favorite buffet in Vegas and would definitely visit the next time I'm there. Great value for the money!"}
{"text":"The best buffet we've ever went to in Las Vegas. Everything is fresh and delicious. The price is very reasonable compared to all other buffets we went to. And above all the service is great. Thanks Josh.
Definitely will go back there."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cheap for a Sunday brunch ($20 if you have a players card, also includes bottomless mimosas)

They have your typical salad bar, a small variety of different types of cuisine and then your breakfast cuisine."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Their prices were much more affordable than other buffets on the strip but I figured how could a resort mess up a buffet anyways, right? WRONG. Food was mediocre at best and there wasn't a huge selection of American food which I thought was odd. I really only ate the pulled pork, beans and hot pocket-like pizza sandwiches. Best part overall was the desert which is were I probably got most of my monies worth. Custom icecream cookie sandwiches was the best and only part I truly enjoyed. I didn't catch the name of the staff in dessert (older Hispanic man) but he was super sweet! I'm curious to know what their breakfast buffet is like but I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Breakfast! It's one of the most important meals of the day. A.Y.C.E. Buffet, it's one of the best local buffets!

At $11 per person (with a \"Preferred\" Stations casinos card) it simply cannot be beat. It's not a typical buffet - it's what Vegas buffets should be - your traditional breakfasts dishes taken to elevated level with a chef's touch.  

The food was better than expected. I really liked all the varieties of single-serving bowls; most or all of them had a poached eggs inside, great for mixing. With the poached eggs were corned beef, ham, rice, or bbq benedict. Of course they had the omelet station - gotta have it. Pancakes & french toast with fresh berries. Oh and the meats! Freshly carved ham, sausages, bacon, country fried steak... All so good. 

There's lots more like an Asian section with noodles, potstickers, and pork baos, an Italian section with bready pizza and the like, a \"Revival\" station for vegan/vegetarian section for superfoods like yogurt and freshly squeeze juices, and of course since it's breakfast so much from the bakery - croissants, rolls, bagels, pastries and so much more I didn't get a chance at because I was so full.

I'm getting sleepy from the food coma so I'm going to end it there. Maybe when I wake up, I'll go back and check out the dinner... Zzz Zzz Zzz"}
{"text":"I would call this the budget version of Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan. Very similar in concept and decor. Pretty good for the price! Lots of variety, some interesting small plates (like brisket and eggs at breakfast). The food was fresh and frequently replenished. One of the best omelet bar omelets we've had anywhere. Our server was very nice, and came by frequently to remove plates and check our coffee. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The Palms buffet is absolutely amazing! It has improved so much since it's been remodeled. The staff is always amazing and provide awesome service!!! Kai makes every experience I have here perfection. She is theeee best!!!"}
{"text":"This is undeniably the best affordable QUALITY buffet for lunch at $12/person outside of the Las Vegas strip. The last time we stayed here was on June 12, 2013 and skipped the buffet. The JAPANESE restaurant nearby west of here was closed Monday so we crossed east to Palms. The Noodle place inside seemed a nice place for a light lunch. We decided to gamble a bit, wash up and come back, but passed by the AYCE buffet. We asked to take a peek inside and was surprised to find out that the Palms Casino became part of the Station Casino group since October 2016. Walking around the buffet stations, the presentation was three grades above last night's Sunset Station Fiesta Buffet (even better dressed) customers, the fresh looking smaller portion food selection. Roasted Calamari was tender, great Italian pizza, Stromboli, Carne Azada, tasty fried fish pollock, mussels, Asian, Italian, Spanish, American, European selections, friendly atmosphere and servers. CHOCOLATE and other  GELATO Ice cream and baked selections. I'm glad the Japanese place was closed and we did not go back to the noodle place next door. HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Marilou, my Most Beautiful Girl in the World! We've been eating too much, anyhow this is one place where you can enjoy quality at an affordable price and walk out gracefully contented and not bursting! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!!!! Highly recommend, Food is delicious, great variety of meats, deserts, breakfast eggs and much more. Very friendly and helpful stuff. Price for Breakfast $12.99 for lunch $15.99. Free parking is also a bonus, will definitely come back ."}
{"text":"The buffet quality w 4.5 stars.  Food quality s 4 stars.  Presentation is 5 stars.  Service is 5 stars.  Decor and ambiance is 3.5 stars.  And the Palm is a nice upscale casino hotel, unlike the other typical Station owned casino hotels. The pros of $10/person is incredible.  The only gripe I have is the lack of good seafood.  But at these prices there is no easy e can really complain.  Hopefully eventually they will add more seafood to their menu."}
{"text":"The more buffets I go to, the more I realize you get what you pay for. 

AYCE sounds like a steal when you see the price, but unfortunately that was the best part of the dinner. Thats not to say it was bad at all, but in a city of buffets, the food just doesn't stand out. The highlight for me though was the cornbread and ribs. 

If you're looking to eat a lot of food but not spend a lot, consider AYCE. If you're okay to spend more though, there are plenty of other world class buffets to chose from"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas! The quality of food is good for the price. I love how they don't have too many choices to where it's overwhelming, or the quality of food goes down. This is my new go to buffet. My favorite section is the Asian And seafood. I recommend this buffet, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH IT. I was with a group of 4 and we all agree, don't waste your money. Vegas buffets aren't what they once were as it is, but this one is no different than the rest. The sushi was clearly not too fresh and tasted like the ones you buy at the grocery store, 100% prepackaged. The bread was completely stale. The lasagna was absolutely atrocious. They didn't have ham, steak, Mac and cheese or pasta! What the!??? Definitely disappointed in the food choices. The service was mediocre at best, she was more concerned with the salt and pepper shakers than drink refills. We were surprised to see that there weren't common buffet items, very disappointing! It may have cost $6 million to build but save your money and go eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came to preview the new place.  Great value, plenty of variety, fresh picks, yummy everything. And we tried pretty much everything. Recommend the brisket, walnut shrimp and the duck. Save room for the french macaroons. Service is wonderful, everyone was friendly. Shoutout to Chris, our server, excellent job."}
{"text":"In a word.... AWFUL.
First we arrived at about 2pm it was not busy yet we waited to be seated nearly 15 minutes. Now I could understand the wait of they were not fully staffed or if they were busy but neither was the case. 
So now lest talk about the food, or should I say the lack of food. First the food had ZERO flavor, the mac and cheese was like eating pasta in cheese water, the pot pie was loose cream with a mushy crust, and when you describe an item as being pepperd you should put pepper on it. Over all food was just bland and bad. Also It seemed that every station had the same items. There was pork, turkey and sushi on every station. A buffet should have a variety and preparing the same item in slightly different ways is not variation. And all the food they picture or show in their commercials is not there. No ribs, no smoke sauage, nothing. 
Another big issue was the lack of cooks at any of the stations. We stood at the carving window waiting, and waiting for someone to assist us and nothing. We had to send a busser in back to get a cook to come out. Also when there were empty items I had asked a cook for more tortillas and he said \"yeah ok\" and NEVER brought them back. I must also mention the dessert station that was again unmanned.
We waited along with other guests for over 10 minutes, we asked numerous times if there was someone working here and was told \"I will go get someone\" and that never happened. 
I finally complained to the manager and the chef and was actually told I was the third complainant of the day about the exact same issues. 
So they are aware of the problems and yet they continue.

So overall dont waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Man this place was horrible! Don't waste your time coming here. I wish I could get my money back. Everything was old and unappealing. The 1 Star was for my unsweetened iced tea, I add sweet and low too. Can't believe the Palms puts out this level of quality"}
{"text":"Great price great food bottomless mimsosas what else can you ask for in a Vegas buffet"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this buffet! Definitely one of the best buffers I've been to in the Las Vegas area. Like many others who have commented to staff there, it is better buy than Wicked Spoon and I actually prefer the food assortment. With a players card, it's $15 for Preferred (lowest status) card holders for lunch. It is a station casino so they honor the rewards cards. It's also very clean and service is awesome. Nice selection of elevated street foods. My friend and I enjoyed it so much we've decided to make it a monthly outing. Hopefully they maintain this establishment and nothing strays from the current standards they hold themselves to."}
{"text":"Ever since the buffet was remodeled the food is amazing, the staff doesn't suck, and the selection is waaaay better. Brisket, macaroons, made to order pasta, and unique presentation.... will be back"}
{"text":"I had family in town and they were staying at the Palm's casino so we decided to go to the buffet for lunch / dinner. I can't say how impressed I am with what the Station Casino company is doing with the Palm's Casino. Yes it is under construction but we didn't have any problem parking or walking through the casino.

The A.Y.C.E buffet was impressive for such a great price. The servers were awesome, always bringing drinks even after we sat for 3 hours catching up, talking and snacking. I really liked the duck confit, french onion sliders, salt and pepper wings, vegetable stromboli, french onion soup and clam chowder. We even had the pasta station cook shrimp with garlic in a wine sauce without the pasta which was delicious. I only had 1 cold item, it wasn't that great for a mushroom quesadilla and I didn't like the hummus and pita. For the deserts, I definitely recommend getting a waffle cone and putting some of their ice cream or it might be gelado in it. The mini creme brulee, mini lemon meringue pastry and carrot cake were truly perfect sweet bites and I had to stop myself from getting a second plate of them.

I will definitely be going back to the Palm's Casino for the A.Y.C.E buffet and so I can update this review with other memorable dishes."}
{"text":"I'm sort of torn between a 3 Star or 4 star rating. The renovation turned this place to be more modern, but the quality of food is still, that of a smaller casino crowd. To me, the quality still doesn't compare to WS. The A.Y.C.E. Buffet's similar style to WS by offering small individual servings is a nice feature, but taste and quality of the food is key. 
I'm not a big dessert person, but the dessert section was actually my favorite station. Their meat station was mediocre. Their beef selection was just roast beef, not even prime rib. The pork loin however was perfectly tender and moist. A lot of their entrees were dry and over cooked. 

I guess overall the price for the buffet is by far a lot less compared to the larger Strip buffet restaurants. The server we had, Marilyn was the best thing from our first experience here at A.Y.C.E. Buffet. Her attention and constant clearing of our used dishes was very much appreciated. Her attention to refilling our beverages and her willingness to go above and beyond made our visit a pleasant one. 

I think my 3 star rating is appropriate for its not horrible, but just average."}
{"text":"I am a local & come here often. It's the best bang for your buck buffet I have found, for Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. There is hardly ever a huge line like most other buffets and free casino parking which is nice. The staff has always been extra friendly & assisting. Locals choice"}
{"text":"A limited selection compared to other Station Casino buffets. The casino is still being improved upon, so hopefully the buffet will also improve with a larger selection and taste."}
{"text":"Some people must have got paid for leaving a review. So far Lucky Penny's been offal. Try the breadfast buffet. Why much improvement in service and look. This buffet is even worst than palace station. You can't get any worst than that. Not much selection for the price. Overall food is dry cold and tasteless. Local been to many buffet. This is the worst. Palms used to have Wow!!!! Restuarant. Stations just ran it into the ground . Tasteless. Save your money . Try somewhere else"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Saturday, was pleasantly surprised by the quality, value, and service here! The best part is that the price wasn't hiked up more on top of the weekend pricing due to Easter Sunday (unlike other hotels on the Strip that increase their buffet prices days before the actual holiday, wtf!). **Note: Easter Sunday is priced more but you do get booze options!**
Since AYCE/The Palms is off-Strip, they probably do need to offer the incentive for tourists and locals to offer a deal that would compete with the other Vegas buffets.

I feel like they have enough for what they priced which is a plus in my gradebook. There's a meat carving station, crepe station, ice cream & desserts, Asian food options (the bbq pork bao was decent...way better than the ones I had at the Bellagio buffet), yogurt/oatmeal plus fixings, pressed juices in double-shot glasses (nice!), some gluten-free options for the health conscious (lol), and the usual breakfast fares (pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage, eggs benny, corned beef hash). While I can't say it was the best food ever, I say it was delicious enough to warrant praise, especially for its price. It was tasty enough to feel satisfied, and not getting sick is always a good thing too.

Sorry kids...no crab legs or oysters during breakfast, but then again you should be paying more for that kind of breakfast option. ;) 

The server who attended to me was friendly and consistent with coming back to top off my water glass. She even made sure that the other servers or the restaurant greeters didn't clear my table away as I was dining solo. Major kudos, totally deserves the extra tips.


Will definitely be returning again!!"}
{"text":"Omg on a scale from 1 to 10 for buffets this is an 11. This is a food heaven. If you want to try all the good stuff you have to come back the day after for round two. Lucky me I work right down the street. Morrocan Lam, Peking duck, Smoked Beef Brisket, Hawaiian Poke, Southern BBQ, French onion soup, Orleans Gumbo, New England Clam Boil Coq Au Vin. I'll get rid of my kitchen and just come here to eat. Whatever diet you are on the Mediterranean, Keto, Low Carb, Vegan  they got it. This is about small healthy fresh cooked plates. Tasting festival of food from all over the world. Nicely done."}
{"text":"The Palms is now actually a Station Casino which is amazing for locals. The idea behind this buffet is to offer low prices with a quality delivery. 

The first time we went took about an hour wait, and I'm assuming that it's because they were so new! The other times we stopped by, the line was quick and we hardly waited which is fantastic because we always come hungry. 

The food is great with lots of choices like corned beef hash, elote, bbq chicken, and many other fancy foods that I can't name. My favorite there are the choices regardless of any time you're visiting. It's definitely not Bacchanal Buffet, but it's certainly delicious for the price you're paying for. With that said, I recommend to try bits and pieces of every dish. 

The service is a borderline miss, but they really try to get your drinks refilled. I believe there was only one time when our server hardly paid attention to us, but even then, that did not stop us from coming back. 

A must try especially when you want to try amazing food outside the Strip."}
