{"text":"Great coffee and cute coffee shops! I frequented them often and every time I am home. We don't have the coffee shops out here yet but I hope we will see them soon.  I get my Van Houtte Coffee at the supermarket out here. The Vanilla Hazelnut tastes as delicious as it smells.  Van Houtte Coffe Shops are cute places for a date or meeting friends. They are also good places to read a book/newspaper.  If I recall correctly, there is one at the airport too."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this Van Houtte and have so far been taking my coffee either from fou d'ici (on de Maisonneuve, closer to Bleury St) or whatever coffee machine they have at the office.  I went to this Van Houtte to explore the competition in the neighbourhood and ordered an Americano.  The first barista, though kind and helpful, did not understand a request I made (which was to add a little bit of room temperature water in the cup before letting the espresso drip). I informed him that what he made was not what I wanted, so my ordered was automatically transferred to another, much less patient and less pleasant barista, who proceeded to obstinately fill my americano with ice cubes, despite my pleading not to. I ended up taking another piping hot americano, so I asked for a glass of water and went ahead and prepared my drink myself.  My thank you's were met by deaf ears, so I quietly walked away with my botched americano.  About the coffee itself, nothing extraordinary: the same dark roast you find in most montreal caf√©s.  Will likely not be going back there for my java"}
