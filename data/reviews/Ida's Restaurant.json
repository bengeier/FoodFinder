{"text":"Ida's is one of the last bastions of great Italian American food in Pittsburgh. The menu is straightforward ... pretty much red sauce only ... spaghetti, rigatoni, gnocchi, ravioli and lasagna and super tender meatballs with great daily specials all generously covered  in her silky smooth tomato sauce. Ida's signature tomato sauce has just the right balance of aromatics and olive oil to bring out the rich tomato taste. 

In my opinion, Ida's is the best red sauce you will find in the area and the closest to anything my Calabrese family makes at home on Sundays. 

Finally, a visit to Ida's is like a visit to a loved relative or close friend's home filled with: warmth, laughter ( she is crazy... and she knows it) great and plentiful food and most importantly Ida's love!"}
{"text":"Ida's is awesome. I don't know why people have given this place crummy reviews. It's not an Olive Garden or a Italian Restaurant chain people...which is maybe what some people are assuming it would be,  seeing as they have complained about pricing and it being a cash only restaurant.. I think the pricing is decent for the portions of food you get. I ordered a large lasagna plate for dinner and it was pretty big. A normal human being would think this is a big portion however, I am a human meatball so I scoffed this huge portion down and was pretty full. There is also a homemade dressing on the table that you have to try. I could probably drink it straight from the bottle. 
The homemade sauce was very good, the server was very attentive and nice, and Ida came over to chat with us and ask us how our dinner was. If you are looking for a unique dining experience, want to try authentic homemade Italian dishes and support a wonderful local business, give this place a try. This is a unique place and if you are lucky enough to meet Ida...you will be entertained. Ida is a super cute, sweet, sassy Italian woman- who has quite a personality."}
{"text":"The service is good the food is good. The only bad thing is the location. Very small building portion sizes are pretty good. Cash only though and also it has great sauce and fresh salads I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Formerly Ida's Place in Arnold, PA. I've heard that the food here is good and decided to give it a try. I couldn't even make it to order dinner. We sat for 10 minutes (at least!) before being greeted. The server had zero personality. The only drinks offered were pepsi, diet pepsi and iced tea - nothing without caffeine. The menu was small and overpriced. Also, they are right next door (as in - shares a door with) a local nail salon. The smell of nail chemicals was so overwhelming my eyes were burning and I was getting a headache. After placing our order for water (because it was the only thing there we could drink) we waited another 10 minutes. Then the server came back to take our order, without even bringing our drinks. We decided to leave - I wasn't about to suffer through an entire dinner at this place. When I told the server that we decided not to stay for dinner, he argued with us and followed us out of the door. Seriously??? Icing on the cake? They are cash only. What a diasaster!"}
{"text":"I love Ida's. Real Italian reasonably priced. Excellent sauce, attentive servers, large servings, BYOB. This has quickly become one of two go-tos when we feel like Italian (Anna's being the other).

I usually go with one of the evening's specials, although you can't go wrong with any choice. 

Cheers!!"}
