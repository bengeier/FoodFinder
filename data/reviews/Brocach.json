{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better review. I've been three times and each time I've really enjoyed the food. The service, on the other hand, is just awful. Last Sunday my husband and I came for brunch. We were seated right away but sat there for 20 minutes before we even were offered water.  We finished our coffee before the food arrived and were never checked on to see if we wanted more. I actually had to go in the back with our mugs and ask for more coffee. They said they ran out and would bring us a carafe when it was ready.  Never did. 

Another time I was with four other girls for a happy hour/dinner. It was not busy at all and was fully staffed so I was thinking it would be a different experience. Unfortunately it just wasn't. From wanting more water/wanting to order another glass of wine, needing silverware & napkins with our food sitting there, and then trying to flag our server down to get our bill taken care of, it was just really disappointing. :( 

The good food just doesn't outweigh the poor service."}
{"text":"I held my wedding reception here for about 40 people and was given the run of the entire upstairs for the night.  We had a great time and the service was wonderful...we hit a few snags but were always able to work it out quickly and without any of my guests being any wiser :)  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a laid back but still classy place to have a private party and especially to the budget bride who doesn't want to pay thousands of dollars just to rent a reception venue.  They even recommended a cake maker who turned out to be an excellent choice, she did an amazing job on our cake and really contributed to some beautiful memories.

We had our own wait staff and bartender and all of my guests told me how much they enjoyed the intimate atmosphere...not really any room for dancing (although we did use the small area near the front as our private \"first dance\" area) but neither one of our families are the dancing type...although if they had been, there certainly would have been room if we had wanted it.  We used the private party menu which had some very good choices available and at reasonable prices too.

Overall the ambiance was intimate, the staff were very friendly and attentive, and we had a great time, as did all of our guests...and the best part is that I was able to arrange all of this by email as I live in Portland, OR!  Caitlyn and Sam were both very helpful and gave me some great advice on how best to use my limited budget and it turned out beautifully."}
{"text":"Very good food and nice ambience. I recommend the scotch eggs. So good! Great location too."}
{"text":"Brocach is one of the best bars to go to in Madison as far as being able to have a conversation and drink good drinks while still having a fun atmosphere. I like to drink upstairs where I can have a view of the capitol.  I used to love the lounge fries, but the last two times I have ordered them, they have skimped on toppings and looked like they've been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time. I hope these improve again. 
They always have vegan food, which is great. Also, try the Hibernian Berry for an after-dinner drink."}
{"text":"Irksome gimmicky pub atmosphere, like a classier Bennigan's."}
{"text":"Okay, we went to the square for dinner. Headed to Old Fashioned, but there was a 45 minute wait--which isn't uncommon, but we were hungry, so we left. We considered Red Sushi, which is great, but decided to try Brocach instead. It was cold out, and hot fare (like Irish stew, Shepherd's Pie, etc.) sounded good. 

It was not good. 

Not at all. 

To be fair, the bartender was nice, courteous, and attentive. 

We got the Corned Beef with Mash and Cabbage, and the Pork Belly Sandwich (side of Lobster Bisk). 

This was, without question, the worst food I've had in Madison. The Corned Beef smelled, and tasted, a bit like marijuana, making me wonder what they're doing back in the kitchen. The mashed potatoes had no flavor whatsoever, and neither did the cabbage. How do you F-up mashed potatoes? Just add butter and cream? Not only was it bland, but the portions were small. This was actually a blessing, because I didn't want to finish the food in front of me. The Pork Belly Sandwich had some odd cream sauce that would've hidden the fact that the pork belly had no flavor. Except that the sauce had no flavor. 

No joke: The highlight of the meal was the side of pickles that came with the sandwich. 

Extremely disappointing. I even ordered a Black & Tan, but they were out of English-style ale. 

If you want a pint and to socialize, this place is fine. For food, this was nothing short of a disappointment."}
{"text":"On a quiet Saturday for lunch, the staff was quick and attentive. Got the Veggie Shepard's Pie and the smoked salmon hash. Both good, especially the Veggie Shepard with an excellent mushroom gravy. Try the ginger black tea as a treat on a cold day!"}
{"text":"i'm mostly judging brocach on its ambience since i've only eaten there once and hardly touched my meal (just wasn't too hungry that night). but this is definitely a place i love to come and meet up with friends. the booths are upstairs are big enough to sit 8, and when the rest of the group joins, there's plenty of room to grab a bigger table or just stand up and mingle. 

i love the dark wood, the noise level (loud from voices, but the music is at the right volume), the beers. definitely my idea of a good bar."}
{"text":"I've been to the Capitol Square Brocach a few times and have always enjoyed it.  But the Monroe Street Brocach has been a disappointment.  I'll never go back.

On my first visit I ordered the Vegetarian Shepard's Pie.  It was my favorite dish at the Capitol location -- always excellent!  Imagine my surprise when I was served a plate with a large pile of mashed potatoes on one side and an equally large pile of carrots and peas on the other side!  They were prepared nicely and were as tasty as mashed potatoes and carrots can be.   But it's cruel to trick a customer into thinking they're ordering a meal and then just slapping a couple of side dishes onto a plate.  Although I was disappointed, I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that my next experience would be better.  Wrong!!!!

My second and final visit to the Monroe Street Brocach was yesterday.  It was St. Patrick's Day and my wife and I found the place comfortably full with the usual noise and din you'd expect from a crowd of people eating and drinking.  I like crowds so I felt comfortable with the situation.  We sat at the bar and ordered two pints of Guinness while waiting for a table.  With my first sip I was greeted by conflicting sensations.  First, the Guinness was cool, creamy and clean -- exactly how it should be.  But at the same time I noticed a new sound:  a blaring noise that became louder and louder until it reached a steady volume that drowned out conversation and completely dominated the atmosphere. After a moment I realized it was the TV.  Somebody had decided to blast a basketball game at maximum volume during dinner!

I looked around at the full restaurant and bar to see how other people were reacting.  Not a single face was turned to the TV screens.  It seemed like none of the patrons were interested in the game.  I left the bar and strolled through part of the dining area and found the noise to be almost as bad.  I realized that my hopes of a comfortable meal at Brocach were no longer realistic.  

But I had a nice pint of Guinness that needed my attention, so I figured I could distract myself with that.  After a couple of  minutes I couldn't take it any longer.  I politely asked the bartender if he would consider turning down the volume.  He looked at me sternly and said no.  I asked if he thought other people in the restaurant wanted to have the sound turned up so loud and he replied \"yes\".

I then did something I've never done before.  I walked away from a full glass of very tasty beer that I had just purchased.  I love beer and I hate wasting money, so it was hard to do.  But I just couldn't take the pointlessly obnoxious atmosphere that Brocach had created.  If I was in a sports bar I wouldn't have been upset.  It's to be expected, although the TV volume at Brocach was louder than most sports bars I've been in.

The Monroe Street Brocach has let me down twice.  I won't make the mistake of going there again."}
{"text":"Usually the folks are nice, usually the food's OK. Fine place to stop in for a beer. The fish fry I'm sure is good much of the time, but mine was way overcooked. The server recommended extra sauce for it, so I got it, then it turned out they charge extra for a ramekin full, just didn't say so beforehand. Wasn't thrilled about that."}
{"text":"No better spot for slug of Tully's and a scotch egg."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group of my family (a party of 8), and was pleasantly surprised when they were able to immediately accommodate us at 8pm on a Friday night with no reservation. The décor isn't that great, but I am willing to overlook it because of the fact that we had couches to sit on at our table and the food was, with a few exceptions, pretty good.
 
With a party the size of ours, we tried a fair amount of the items on the menu. Their loaded fries, or whatever they call them, are awesome! They were immediately demolished by our table. The beer cheese was also delicious, and the steaks we had were perfectly cooked. My two complaints about the food were 1. Their fried fish was bland (my party concurred) 2. Tooooo much pepper in some dishes. Their potato leek soup tasted like the cap fell off the pepper while the spice was being added and they just went with it. It was just too much. This was echoed in the lemon-pepper fettuccine alfredo, but was still a pretty solid dish even with the peppery burn to every bite."}
{"text":"We frequent Brocach on Monroe St. often. Some of our favorite aspects of it are its ample seating and tasty food. The children's menu is fantastic, too--with the Maxburger being their favorite entree."}
{"text":"This past March, on my our very first trip to Madison, (from Chicago) my partner and I decided on food and a Pint at Brocach's.  Even though it was a little chilly that day, we had a couple pups with us and decided to brave the elements and sit outside.  The vegetarian Sheppard's pie was amazing as well as the Guinness, but that is not the only reason we fell in love with this place.  A homeless man, who appeared to be under the influence or living with mental illness, decided to claim a table at the outside seating area and disrupt other customers.  The manager, (do not know her name but she appeared to be in her late 20's with blond hair, came to diffuse the situation.  I have never seen such warm and beautiful treatment of another human being by restaurant staff.  I'm sure it happens, but I think our first instinct is to yell and scream and call the police.  This manager asked the man to leave, allowing him autonomy to do so.  On the third attempt she helped him over to the bus stop, entertaining his ramblings and protecting him from the hard concrete that he was destined to fall to!  When she returned, I praised her actions and she said it was nothing as she retrieved a glass of water for this gentleman to rehydrate with.  While trying to run an establishment, this amazing woman took the time out to help a fellow human being, and treat him with the respect that I am sure not many give him.  So to you blond manager, thank you for being a wonderful human being!!  Everyone should visit Brocach's if in Madison not only for the warm service, but for the food too!!  For a couple vegetarians at an Irish pub, our meals and beers were amazing!
Vegetarian Sheppard's Pie and Guinness ftw:)"}
{"text":"Very cozy, family-friendly atmosphere with great Irish/pub food.  

Took our daughters with us who are 5 and 8 and they loved it.  I had the Bangers and Mash and my wife had the Fish and Chips and both were delicious.  Generous portion sizes.  I only ate half of mine and took the rest home for lunch the next day.  

Both the kids had Mac and Cheese and it wasn't some Kraft and Mac N Cheese, but homemade.  Ice Cream is included in the kid's meals which was a hit.  

Service was prompt and friendly and the food came out fast.  Brocach on Monroe St has  a great atmosphere whether you have kids or not and we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I used to love that Brocach had a decent selection of meatless options. Apparently after the remodel, that is not the case. The only menu items I had to chose from were a soup and some salads. While I was here on Saturday night with my boyfriend, I ordered the Power Bowl and he got a burger. We got cheese curds for an appetizer, which had too much breading and weren't anything special at all. When our food came, my boyfriend's fries were cold, and he said the burger was just okay. My dish was a bit of a disaster, though. It is described as baby kale, romaine, quinoa, sweet potato, red beets, red onion, and toasted almonds. I looked though my bowl and there was no quinoa in sight, nor did I see any almonds. Worse yet, I I saw maybe two leaves of kale.I ordered the power bowl specifically for the quinoa and kale so I wouldn't end up with just a salad, as I'm not the type of person to order a salad at a restaurant because it's not all that filling and just seems like a waste of money. Not only did I end up with a salad, but I ended up with cheap romaine lettuce and not even decent greens. I asked our waitress, and it was then that she informed me they were out of quinoa, rather than informing me when I ordered it, so I basically ended up with a dish not even close to what I ordered, considering 3 of the ingredients were missing. She did offer more sweet potato and beets, but that didn't much compensate at all. I assumed she would chop a few dollars off of our bill, but she still charged me full price for the dish that wasn't even the actual menu item I ordered. Definitely not a great experience."}
{"text":"Brocach has a lot to offer, with a menu and service that ends itself well to repeat visits. The fish fry  is excellent, with outstanding choices for lunch or, better, Sunday brunch. In addition, the nicely selected wines fit the menu nicely. Yet it's the details that matter. The breads are nice: the rye and sourdough are excellent choices. The winter squash salad is exceptional. Yet wait staff make a difference -- Michael and Rebekah represent Brocach well. Kudos on having such a well run establishment."}
{"text":"I think Brocach is a solid option in Madison.  The menu is pretty diverse and the food is quite good for a pub.  Price are decent, maybe a little high.  I would say dinner entrees range from about $9-17 or so.  They have more traditional Irish options, like sheppard's pie or bangers and mash, as well as roast chicken, burgers, pasta and a few vegetarian choices.  As you would guess, they have a number of good beers, as well and wine and cocktails. Their brunch is actually good too.  I don't think that many people realize they serve it, because it's never that crowded.  

The place is large, so there usually isn't a terrible wait.  I don't remember every having a problem with service.  Atmosphere is nice.  They have typical Irish pub décor, and the inside is well-maintained."}
{"text":"New to  Monroe Street this Irish Pub has the atmosphere of Ireland without all the smoke. Great service, food and from what it looked like from a teetotaler, a good supply of Guinness. 
The Fish & Chips, and the Mac & Cheese were hot & tasty.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff, and food! We ended up here when another restaurant close by said they couldn't (ever!) accommodate parties of more than 8, despite how many tables were available. Brocach was happy to accommodate us, the service was great, and the food was too. Highly recommend the apple old-fashioned."}
{"text":"I've done dinner and brunch here. The burger is ok - nothing to write home about. I enjoyed the brie mac & cheese, but that's a well you don't always want to drink from. The brunch options feel kind of limited and I was under whelmed.

 Decent selection of whiskey and sort of what you expect in Madison for beer. I like the atmosphere, the pseudo-pub-feeling-restaurant vibe is good.

I'll go again when the mood strikes, but it's not a must-visit destination for me."}
{"text":"Where did the Irish go!?

Those who remember the Brocach of years gone by might be a bit disappointed when they cross the threshold into the renovated tavern. The food is still good and the bar reflects the same broad variety of whiskeys and beer, but the new decor lacks the old homey feel. I'm missing the wobbly wooden tables and raucous groups hanging out upstairs. Three stars for good food and outstanding service, but bring back the Irish pub, please!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong here. The brunch is amazing, and the rest of the menu is delicious. The atmosphere and waitstaff are wonderful too. It looks classy and has a neighborhood bar feel. Oh yeah, and beer, always good beer at decent prices."}
{"text":"Both my husband and I grew up in the restaurant industry. We are very critical of where and what we eat. This is my first, and will probably by my only, 5 star rating. 

We have been to Brocach many times. Each time we are impressed with the food and the service. We generally go to dinner on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evening around 7-8pm. We've always been greeted and seated right away. 

The salmon is unbelievably good. Most places dress salmon up with a sauce because it can be a fickle fish to prepare. it can be underdone, or overdone. The Broach's salmon was prepared perfectly! They are so confident in their ability to cook a good salmon, that it is served minus a sauce. Superb all around. 
My last meal was the Berkshire Porkchop. I took one bite and had a religious experience. Definitely recommended!

Besides the food, the service is great. Management has always been present and our servers have always been exceptionally knowledgeable and polite. In fact, our server last night, Zack, actually ASKED if he could take our plates when we  were finished. That is a level of politeness rarely found in these days of 'feed 'em and get 'em outta here' mentality. We never found ourselves waiting for a server, our food was served quickly, efficiently, and was excellent. The management and servers are warm and inviting. 

Because of the prices, this is often a once month or every other month splurge for us. But the cost is worth how delicious the food is!"}
{"text":"Had some cocktails here during the winter festival. The atmosphere was great. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food but the service was very good and we will be back. I'd recommend as a nice bar to gather at and I know they have live music as well."}
{"text":"Host seated us at our table and we were then ignored for 20 minutes, so we left. Several servers kept walking by us helping the tables around us, but we never received any acknowledgment. Ironically, the bartender did thank us as we were leaving. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time to Brocach. The shepherd's pie my first time was amazing and filling. Tonight i went with the special, a pasta with chicken, asparagus, sauteed onions and parmesan/bread crumb crusting. Being primarily irish-oriented, this dish rivaled some of my best italian experiences! Bravo! I am very impressed and will be back. The bloody and blueberry press house cocktails are really good as well, as is the selection of whiskey."}
{"text":"We had a Saturday morning breakfast.  There were only three breakfast choices on Saturday and the lunch menu.  The options were corn beef and hash, french toast, and a vegetable frittata.  I was a a little disappointed by the lack of options.  My wife and I both ordered the frittata and we were not disappointed at all.  It was easily the best frittata that I have ever had.  It had cherry tomatoes, roasted peppers, mushrooms, asparagus, fresh basil, and chèvre.  It was absolutely delicious.  The fried potatoes that came with were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I and 8 friends had dinner on yesterday. Foods were plain and dry but cheesecake was good. The main problem was a waiter. He showed up only 3 times: taking orders, serving and checking. He didn't take care us AT ALL. He didn't give us enough plates for appetizers and never gave me although I requested twice! In addition, I had to refill water by myself. 

OK food + TERRIBLE service = I'll NEVER go there again

This place is good if you only drink, not eat."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday night for dinner. The place was relatively empty at first however as time progresses the place started to fill up. Out waiter was very nice and fast. Food was classically good and the restaurant itself was beautiful. The service was very fast and well planned. The bangers and mash was very delicious."}
{"text":"Brocach catered our Milwaukee wedding a few years ago and it was incredible food. Brocach has since moved out of the Milwaukee area, so for our anniversary this year we decided to head to Madison to enjoy Brocach again.
It was a Saturday around 11:30, and when we got there, there was only one other party in the restaurant. The server started off very attentive and helpful and took our order. 25-30 minutes went by and still no food. We don't mind waiting for food, even though we did feel that was excessive for how busy the restaurant was. But our server did not come and check on us one time, or give any update on our meal, or refill berverages. I had to walk over and ask the bartender for an update. Our food come out pretty much instantaneously after I asked. Our toddler's food seemed like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long, forgotten time. But my food, and my husbands food were so tasty. He had the irish breakfast and I had one of their specials. So, so good. It's a shame it was marred by such poor service. Don't know that we'll make the hour trek again unless we read that service has improved."}
{"text":"I received my food  more than 5 minutes after the rest of the party, and when I asked for a spoon to drink the broth it took until the broth was lukewarm at best. I'd recommend trying the other Brocach."}
{"text":"Worst Bar Bathroom in Madison

It's upstairs in a back hallway. Supposedly, the lesser known louvre. More like the louvre that not even the owner knows about because it's f-ing disgusting. There's one stall for an entire floor of intoxicated chicks. The door kind of closes, so you have to meet it just right with the door frame or it'll only close partway, making it look like nobody's in the stall. Not good on period nights.

The toilet isn't fastened to the floor, so it tips when you sit your drunk ass down. No idea why no one got around to bolting the toilet to the floor. Seems like a given, but, hey, this is the worst bar bathroom in Madison. Anything goes. Seriously, though, customers shouldn't be able to tip your toilet like a friggin' cow."}
{"text":"I had to try the Monroe St. Brocach after I read about the Circus of Chefs win. The food is absolutely incredible and unparalleled by any other restaurant in Madison. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Never again. The place has a nice interior and is quiet but the service and the food are awful. I ordered the Irish Cheese Mac and a bottle of beer. The Mac were bland and cold by the time they arrived at our table and the beer came at room temperature. I was unable to ask for salt and pepper or even make a complaint because the waiter was a no-show for 45 minutes. Completely unacceptable. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Really great food, decent beer selection, and great drinks. Try the Irish Coffee."}
{"text":"I don't know if I went on a bad morning or what, but my brunch was just barely edible.  It was served only lukewarm, the eggs were soggy (not exactly sure how to describe them?).  The whole thing was actually pretty forgettable except for my disappointment in the food and my annoyance with the slow and pretty dismissive waitress.  The place wasn't even full and she took forever to come around to us again. Also, I gues I would have thought most prices were overpriced for that food - but I really did not appreciate paying so much for soggy eggs I could have made better at home. Only the company (a good friend) saved the day! Not a fan."}
{"text":"Cead Mille Failte!  One thousand and one welcomes meet you here along with everything Irish.  Cozy warm place with good food and pints.  You will leave with an Irish brogue."}
{"text":"The food is expensive, but the happy hour will get you the best neat/rocks prices in the city on an extremely impressive array of whiskies. Bunnahabhain neat with a pint of Murphy's on the side, all for $10? They'll certainly be getting my business again!"}
{"text":"This is a 5 star review for the fish fry, which was melt in your mouth delicious. Had to slooww it down on the walk home after eating because we were so full of fish, in the best possible way. Don't miss out on the marble rye bread! And curry cole slaw was a nice touch, too!"}
{"text":"Atmoshere is Nice and does not feel as crowded as the one by capitol. My only disappointment was that the menu is different...but the food was very good."}
{"text":"We used to love eating here but unfortunately they changed the menu and it was a big let down tonight. Please bring back the old menu with the risotto salmon and duck-fat frites. Ambiance is still great though."}
{"text":"Outside seating was great. The staff switched halfway through our meal and the replacement dude was kind of not the best. But the food was great and the atmosphere is ten times better that the monroe st. location."}
{"text":"Who does not love a cool Irish Pub?  The decor on the inside is amazing and that is why it gets five stars.  The inside is much larger than it would appear from the outside and the food and beer is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. This used to be one of my favorite places in grad school. Unfortunately, both the food and the service have dropped off significantly. First, our group of 8 people were seated at a table that did not seat more than 6 comfortably. We had to ask to move. I asked for a beer, and it took forever to come out, probably 15-20 minutes. I got the fish and chips and asked for an extra tarter sauce, and by the time it came I had already finished the fish. Others at our table had a similar experience. The fish was mushy, and two of the pieces were battered together into one large piece with uncooked batter in the middle. The waitress then came back and brought the bill and asked if we were set without asking if we wanted dessert. Then a few minutes later she came back and said she really needed us to leave because they have a reservation, even though we hadn't even been there that long. The only reason I didn't give this one star is a couple people at the table thought their entrees were alright, but this sure isn't the place I remember. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I liked the old menu, but decided to try it after the remodel. I ordered mussels, which were probably the worst mussels I've had in madison. The broth didn't have a lot of flavor, except for salt! It was almost inedible it was so salty. And there was corn in it??? Not sure what two cuisines they were trying to \"fuse\" there, but it was not good. My friend ordered a salad, which she also found oddly salty? Why so, so much salt?"}
{"text":"Was one of the worse dining experiences I have had in a long time.   Service was terrible took 2.5 hours to order and receive all of our food.   When it did come out it came out sporadically no one at our table could eat at the same time.   It also was so hot in the restaurant I was sweating during the meal.   This place is not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Brocach - you made me sad tonight. I can see why there wasn't a wait for a table at 7pm on a Saturday (blessing and a curse?) Nice staff (server and hostess) nice comfy booth. But your food?! What happened? It used to be delicious - lick the sauce from the plate delicious. But now - you're serving frozen burger patties with wimpy thin-cut bacon? Not yummy. I'll remember your glory days pre-renovation."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that my fiance and I chose to have our rehearsal dinner upstairs in the lounge (reserved for no fee).  The atmosphere is so unique and cozy.  There's really no place like it in town.  The food NEVER disappoints.  Their chefs must really know what they're doing because their food is the kind that makes me say, \"This is soo good,\" after every bite.  That's how you know I really love something.  

For brunch try the corned beef and hash--to die for!"}
{"text":"Holy Fish Fry, Pacman!  A friend and I were in Madison for a concert a couple of weeks ago and were walking around the square trying to decide where to eat/drink.  We stumbled upon Broach and both had the all you can eat Fried Haddock.  It was very very good!!!  Nice flakey breading and the tender juicy meat inside cooked perfectly.  Being two hungry boys after the drive from Chicago, we must have eaten several pounds of fish.  The fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, done right.

Atmosphere?  Easy to be in no bullshit Irish pub with good food.  

Were I living in Madison, I would try some different dishes as they have a good variety.  But if/when I'm ever back on a Friday, I'd probably opt for the Fish Fry again."}
{"text":"We went here for a post-graduation dinner and were very pleased.  There were 11 of us for dinner and they were ready and set up for us.  Good service as well.  I also liked the ambiance of the place -- kind of rustic.
Our food was good but forgettable.  Just a decent place with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to this \"irish pub\" for irish breakfast.  Was informed they they \"use to have irish breakfast, but no longer do.\"  This place an Irish pub as much as a processed cheese is a diary product."}
{"text":"Love this bar for drinks after work.  Great bar food and love the dim-lit atmosphere. 

 Took a star away because the last time I was there the service was very slow.  It was a badger game night and all, but when I have to be the one to initiate contact something is wrong.  The extra wait staff had no wait skills or personal skills whatsoever.  

In the end, i'm still going back again and again for their loaded fries!"}
{"text":"visited this spot on the spur of the moment because it's directly across from the capital where they do the concert on the square with a colleague and her dad from out of town. i love irish pubs. my staple is to immediately go for the fish and chips. i seem to judge a pub on this dish, aside from any ales they make on tap (if it's a micro brew). but my eyes scanned the menu and i got caught up with some very uncharacteristic choices. 

we ordered the sweet chili shrimp for starters. very nice skewer of large shrimp and who can resist sriracha sauce? for an entree i ordered the lemon pepper fettuccine in an olive oil with mushrooms, leeks and parmesan. you have a choice of chicken, steak or salmon, but because i was such a fan of the shrimp, i asked my server if i could order it with shrimp instead. she told me they didn't serve shrimp... huh? 

i reminded her that i just had shrimp for the app, and she goes, \"oh! no, those are PRAWNS.\" i couldn't help but laugh at this. nonetheless, i asked her to check with the kitchen to see if that would be possible. when she returned, she said they couldn't do it. funny. how hard is it to sautee a few shrimp and toss them on some pasta. right about now i'm regretting not getting the fish and chips. but i simply order another shrimp app with the meal and tell her i'll put the shrimp in the pasta my damn self. sheesh. 

food is good though. a little heavy handed with the oil, but the texture of the noodles was good, the flavor was pretty nice and light, and of course the shrimp set it off. place was noisy like a pub which i liked and expected, happy people having a good time.  good beer choices as well. i'll be back for the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Yes, the upscale Irish pub thing is overdone, but if it's done well, who cares. It's got a beautiful bar, large tap selection, and a great capitol view. I even love the fish fry. There are lots of nooks and crannies for you and friends to talk privately in a packed place."}
{"text":"After walking around Madison for a while, I decided to give this a try for dinner - and enjoyed it enough that I went back a second time a few days later.  Great beer, good service, and tasty food. Nice atmosphere, too.

There are lots of interesting restaurants in this area, and this is one of the tops."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about at Brocach's 2 for 1 burger night! The special burger, called the Dublin City Burger was great. It had bacon, onion straws, mushrooms, and a guiness and cheddar sauce. So good! The service was also excellent and the food came out promptly, though it probably helped that they were dead tonight. The atmosphere was cozy and their playlist somehow included all my favorite songs, so that was a bonus."}
{"text":"I had been to Brocach a few times prior, but only for drinks. We chose Brocach to host a party for a group of about 15 people. Brocach accommodated all of our requests from beginning to end. Our waiter was excellent, friendly and there were no issues with service or food. All staff in the restaurant were helpful and kind. We were able to bring a cake and we were provided with a lot of space to eat, mingle, open gifts etc... It really could not have gone any better. Separate checks were also allowed which made it nice for our large group. 
Our event could not have gone any better and the restaurant truly made that possible."}
{"text":"Athe atmosphere is very homey. I felt like pounding steins on the tables like the hobbits in lord of the rings. Staff was great.

I had the braised lamb which I did not enjoy. It comes with a sweet grapes sauce and quinoa bed and kale salad. The sweetness was off putting. The salty savory flavors are far more migh style with meats.

Also got to try lobster bisque, the reuben (overly salty), the burger, pub fries, and curds. Everything was not bad but not great.

The food here is unpretentious though and seems to have soul behind it. I would not hesitate to visit again and would not be surprised if a different dish might push my opinion a little higher."}
{"text":"I had a good time here on St Patrick's Day. I recommend the fish n chips. I was hesitant because it was $14 but it was DELICIOUS!! Great service from Sam!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Apparently there is a new chef. The Challah French toast was replaced by a banana French toast. 

Unfortunately, the dish was a huge miss. The toast itself was fine. The chef added a banana butter. He tried to be inventive and topped it off with an eclectic trail mix consisting of banana chips, cinnamon toast crunch cereal, and candied mixed nuts...It was far too much. The nuts made the entire dish too salty and threw the flavor. 

My recommendation to the chef: choose just one nut to candy, the pecan. The cashews and peanuts are far too much flavor and sodium. Then top with either fresh fruit, or perhaps a fancier bourbon banana. I ate half and felt wasteful because it wasn't even doggie bag worthy. 

I was a few blocks from my house before I threw up all $11 onto the sidewalk. 

I do like B in general, but this dish was such a catastrophe I am downgrading my previous '4' rating."}
{"text":"Recommend Shepherd's Pie, stew beef rather than steak"}
{"text":"Tried Brocach for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! Our waiter was top-notch and my mixed greens salad with couscous and grilled salmon was delightful. What caught my eye as I was enjoying my lunch was all of the food being served to other tables. I am looking forward to going back and ordering something less healthy!"}
{"text":"Food: delicious, stellar flavors,  perfect portions, speedy delivery to table. 
Wait staff: inattentive and juvenile
Customers: mixed group of arrogant hipster millennials and genuine good people who are just out to have a good time. 

Asked my waiter about a specific drink he didn't know. Had to ask him to ask the bartender if she was familiar with it. He came back and said I could go ask the bartender myself. . I can,  but why wouldn't I believe you when you said you asked? Ended up asking for what I thought was in the drink,  and the waiter snarkily asked whether it was what I was looking for.  Then ordered jameson, which my waiter referred to as \"jamo\" every time he mentioned it. 

Service was slow and disordered. We received our food before our drinks. Not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't care."}
{"text":"Had never been here before, the atmosphere is very comfortable and intimate. The waitresses were nice and somewhat attentive. My biggest complaint is the food. 
I was told the new chef recently change the ENTIRE menu and when we went they were still working out kinks in dishes they were serving to people. For the price the portions were small. Id understand the size if the food was amazing but they were still tweaking the menu. I think the chef may have just gotten out of culinary school or is feeling extra experimental. 
We got $12 duck wings which were ok but there were only a few on the plate and there was literal breakfast cereal on top which i think cheapened the dish. I ordered the venison dish which came out cold. The meat sat on a few random purees/reductions/sauces which i dont think paired well. I was also really confused about how i should go about eating it at first. My significant other got farro and it was actually pretty good however the tomatos were far too sour (i think they were pickled) and there was a lemon merangue(?) on top which tasted like lemon pledge, that was gross. 
I honestly just wanted traditional irish food so i was sort of disappointed. We spent $60 total. Maybe im just not enough of a foody to understand."}
{"text":"Went here today (Easter) with my family.  Was in the mood for warm comfort food so I ordered the shepherd's pie.  It wasn't bad but there was little flavor.  The pots and meat tasted the same.  Bummed."}
{"text":"My family went to Brocach on Sunday to celebrate our daughter's  finance's birthday.  We miss the half chicken with. Colcannon and sautéed spinach.  The food we had (fish' chips, bangers and mash, corned beef) was acceptable but not of the same caliber we had come to expect.
We don't go downtown a lot to eat. There are better places than this closer to our suburban life."}
{"text":"We visited Brocach's on Monroe Street on 4/9/14. Overall, the food was extremely disappointing. The service was adequate, but average.

We arrived and were promptly seated by a host who seemed a bit cranky. However, it was about 8pm on a Tuesday night, so the lack of waiting was not surprising. The restaurant does look very nice.  The decor is similar to their original Capitol Square location: dark wood paneling, cozy and warmly colored walls, and a very welcoming \"Irish-Pub vibe\".

We ordered the Beer Cheese Dip appetizer, which came with soft pretzel sticks for dipping. The dip arrived with a  congealed \"skin\" on top, as though it had been sitting out and cooling for awhile before being served. The liquid cheese underneath the solid surface had a bitter, almost metallic, aftertaste. I imagine that the goal was for the dip to have a pronounced beer flavor, but it didn't work for me. It hardly tasted cheesy at all, and the taste it left in my mouth was gross. My dining partner didn't seem to dislike this dish as much as me, so this could be a matter of my personal preference. However, for a $9 dollar appetizer, it should have at least been served piping hot, rather than lukewarm. Unfortunately, this item provided an ominous preview of what was still to come.

My partner was in the mood for something light so he ordered the American Club sandwich with french fries. He commented that the sandwich, which contained ham, turkey, cheddar, swiss, lettuce, tomato and mustard, was \"extremely average\", and rated it \"5 out of 10\". He liked his fries a lot though, and thought they were the saving grace of his meal. The fries looked and tasted a lot like McDonald's fries, and everyone knows how tasty those are!

In the mood to splurge with no regard to calories, I ordered off of the \"Mac and Cheese\" section of the menu. I got the Bacon Bleu Mac, which the menu claimed contained: \"trottole pasta, bacon, scallions, cream, bleu cheese, cheddar cheese curds\" 

What came out to me was: under cooked (hard and chewy) pasta in an extremely dry (nearly non-existent) generic cheese sauce.  The vast plate was topped with about 3 blue cheese crumbles, which was not enough to impart a discernible blue cheese flavor to the dish. There was an overwhelming amount of crumbled-up bacon and no scallions. 

The only flavor in the dish was bacon. I like bacon as much as the next person, but the flavor was overpowering. I gave half of it to my bacon-loving dining partner so that I could attempt to taste the other flavors. I was unsuccessful, as there were no other flavors to be found.

When I ordered, I was envisioning a luscious, rich, and creamy dish with a variety of subtle flavors and lots of cheesy goodness.  What I got was a boring plate of plain dry pasta with too much bacon crumbled on top. It was not good, and I would have been more satisfied eating Kraft from a box. 

 I was a fan of Brocach's downtown location so I was surprised by how much of a let-down this was. I also hear they have a site in Milwaukee now too. I fear that Brocach may be sacrificing quality for quantity in their recent expansions, and sadly, I cannot recommend this restaurant anymore based on the quality and flavor of the foods we tried. Step it up, Brocach!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I don't think much of UK cuisine. It's always struck me as bland and obvious, both in conception and execution.

Maybe that admitted bias is why I ordered the Reuben Breakfast Burrito for my first visit to Brocach. The contents itself were done fairly even if the corned beef was (deliberately?) over seasoned. The eggs could have used some pop and suffered from the same overcooked problems most scrambled dishes do. I also wouldn't have minded some more kraut. The burrito's dough was tremendous however, light and flaky yet miraculously able to contain its contents. The potatoes on the side were also well cooked and not overly salty.

The service was excellent, I might add."}
{"text":"Hosted a bachelorette party of 15 here this past weekend.  Organizing with the Manager, Marcos, was a breeze.  He was so friendly and accommodating - he even made up a special menu that stated the name of the group and event.  It's amazing that we could reserve a group space for free.  The bride is not a real picky person, but commented on how great everything was.  Although she ordered the Reuben, she wished she would have ordered the Mac N' Cheese.  Drinks were great and server was attentive.  Definitely recommend for any group looking for a great atmosphere at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"You know, I came in totally telling myself to order the Guinness braised beef and rate that because at this point the bangers and mash must just be so overrated and it could never live up to my expectations if greatness. So I sat down, got ready to order my braised beef with mash, but when the very nice waiter came and asked what I wanted, my mouth, by some will if its own, said bangers and mash. And man. My mouth is one smart cookie. I've been to Ireland twice but THIS. THIS stuff is good.

Now I'm not going to lie to you. It's 13$ for three sausages and mash. But yum. And filling enough, for a normal person at least, I've been told I eat like a baby dinosaur. 

Warning, get too much apple and sauce in one bite and it can get a little overwhelmingly sweet.
Also, it's a little dark for lunch."}
{"text":"We have been to Brocach on a few occasions in both locations. The staff are good and attentive. They can cater for celiac and have a list that can help you decide. I always like the full Irish breakfast. My wife got a biscuit with egg, cheese and rasher with a side of breakfast potatoes and fresh fruit. They changed our order because it had a sauce we did not request, so a whole new portion of potatoes and fruit. I think it is priced fairly well."}
{"text":"The food was flavorful service was awesome corn beef was a little chewy but still tasted really good"}
{"text":"I had to spell this about 6 different ways before I found it - and I've been here probably 10 times.  Eep.

Anyway, onto the review.  We came here on New Year's Eve with a party of 8.  They shifted uncomfortably, said they would look around, then took us upstairs to a nearly empty bar.  Seriously, I know a party of 8 without reservations is a faux pas, but don't feign busy-ness just to make us feel bad about patronizing your business.

I started out with the potato leek soup which was very tasty.  Definitely recommend.  For dinner I had the Shepherd's Pie, which was delicious - though a leeeetle dry and a little too salty in the meat.  The meat was traditionally mixed with peas, with a big pile of mashed potatoes on top.  Somewhere in there either I needed a side of gravy (yes, I'm a fatass) or it needed more butter - but nonetheless, meat + mashed potatoes = mmmm.  I complemented my meat pie with a Stella, about which there is nothing to rave or complain.

Most of our table either had the regular Shep, veggie Shep, or fish and chips, and we all left satisfied.  The fish and chips looked awesome - crispy, thin batter, served with steak fries.  The veggie Shepherd's Pie was also reportedly good, with our veg friends saying it tasted just as good as meat... which I suppose is a compliment to fake meat, since I think it usually sucks.  Why you wouldn't just eat meat then, the world may never understand.

Our waiter was pretty good - he even kept separate checks for each patron, which was nice.  He kept messing up the names though, so I was like, \"Either don't try to remember our names, or put the tickets in some sort of order, because we just have to correct you each time.  But really, thanks for splitting the checks...it's a big pet peeve of mine when you don't do that.\"

Anyway, despite the \"we're so busy\" shenanigans at the beginning, I was really happy with dinner.  It gave me a fabulous base for all that New Year's drinking, and it wasn't too pricey either."}
{"text":"Fairly generic food in a somewhat \"Irish-themed\" restaurant.
This is basically the place you come when you just want a decent drink halfway between where you are and your final destination to warm up or if every other place is full for dinner."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. Boyfriend and I arrived at an off time and the place was almost empty (there were 2 other tables occupied). We waited about 10 minutes for drinks. Shepherd's pie was super disappointing and gave off a frozen vibe. Innards were watery and tasted like canned vegetable soup. Mashed potatoes were ice cold in many areas. Still on the hunt for a Shepard's pie that reminds me of time spent in Ireland. :("}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good Irish brews and food. Had breakfast here with a friend. The sausage with the bangers and mash was excellent. I had the lox which was pretty great too"}
{"text":"This was one of the first places I tried in Madison.  After having several brunches and lunches this is one of my favorite places to go.  The food at this clean, upscale Irish styled pub is consistently very good as is the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I came here because of my fellow Yelpers. It did not disappoint.

We had a scotch egg, and duck fat fries for appetizers. Both were delicious. The duck fat fries are probably one of the best things I've eaten in some time... AND, the left overs tasted great the next day!

My fiancé had a salad, and she said she really liked it. I got the shepherd's pie, which was extremely delicious.

One thing I will say is this... the food came out SOOO fast. I mean, so fast that it almost felt like everything is pre-made in advance. It was literally 3-5 mins for the apps, and another 5 mins for the entrees. I've not seen that kind of speed before in a restaurant where everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Sunday brunch! Cozy atmosphere and dinning environment, and friendly waitresses, and especially they have very tasty food (my friend and I ordered The biscuits and gravy and Ploughman's breakfast, YUM!!!), all these are enough for you to walk in and enjoy. There were three musicians playing live classical music during our brunch time, wonderful experience at this place! PS. I love their decor and furniture, vintage and Irish style."}
{"text":"My son and I went to lunch here this week and it was a pleasant surprise.  We didn't know that they had only opened this restaurant/pub a couple a months ago, so we were impressed with the interior, service and food.  

My son ordered the Shepherd's Pie.  It was tasty with short ribs, potatoes, peas and carrots, but it wasn't in the form of a \"pie\".  It was almost deconstructed.   I ordered their macaroni and cheese.  It had a very rich cheese sauce and also kielbasa slices on top, but the real gift were the sauteed asparagus.  We had also ordered a \"beer cheese dip\" with large slices of soft pretzels.    

Our server, Sam, was so personable and pleasant.  He even conversed with me about his dreams, family, interests, and travel adventures.  My son and I had a most enjoyable afternoon.  If you're ever on Monroe St., check out this place.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Reuben classic sandwich was well executed.  the meat was nicely pulled, not just sliced as is the typical US method. Good balance of sauce and kraut. I have a hobby of trying Reubens in each country I visit, now up to about 20 cities in 16 countries in Europe and Asia. This sandwich ranks among the best!"}
{"text":"Was a great 'true pub' we loved visiting as a family to have good food and a pint. Recent visit consisted of service so slow we went to the bar for a drink refill, 12 children running around screaming, and the football playoff games blaring so loud we couldn't hear ourselves speak. Labeled as Irish pub, our experience was a darker lit Buffalo Wild Wings. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love me some Irish bars something serious. Be it the beers, the atmosphere, the food. I love it all. 

This comes in quite handy having married an Irish woman that loves to take me to these types of places. 

We love this place so much, we decided to use their upstairs room for our wedding rehearsal dinner of roughly 25 people and couldn't have had a better time. The service was excellent and the view of the capital priceless (well I guess it did have a price, but well worth it). 

We even had an Irish band that plays there, Westwind, play the cocktail hour of our wedding.

College waitstaff that is better than most bar/restaurant places in the area I have found upon my 6+ visits. 

Great on a weeknight, weekend, or post Badger victory."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my young daughter before a shopping trip to Trader Joe's. I picked it because I figured it would have a kid's menu (it did). Really not a good experience with the service. While the food was really quite good (herbivore platter for me which had bread, pita chips, some kind of incredibly tasty hummus, carrots, olives) and macaroni and cheese for daughter (the BEST kid's macaroni and cheese I have sampled anywhere), our service left a lot to be desired.

Upon entering we were told to sit where we liked. We found a spot by the window and behind us sat two girls, probably in their mid-20's. Our server was VERY attentive to these girls, checking back on them at least 3x as well as conversing at length (I got the feeling maybe one of them had worked there with the server at one time by how they were chatting). This is fine EXCEPT he NEVER checked back with us, the only other people sitting in that area. He forgot to bring my daughter's milk and even though I tried to flag him down and even call after him, \"excuse me sir\"...nothing. Finally we sat for a good 10 minutes after finishing eating, with me constantly trying to catch his eye (he would literally walk right past us to talk to the girls directly behind us!) and he came over and said, \"oh, I forgot the chocolate milk.\" I said, \"we don't need it now but can she get her ice cream cup?\" I was pretty annoyed at this point as I had been at what I had hoped would be a simple lunch for nearly an hour. This should NOT have taken so long! When he returns with the ice cream it's one of those pre-done kinds in a styrofoam cup. Daughter is insistent on eating it but it is ROCK HARD. More annoyance for me as I try to chisel her ice cream into edible bites. Maybe they could take the ice cream out when they see the customer is close to finished eating main course? It added another 10 minutes on to a lunch I had wanted to exit about 30 minutes before.

I won't return which is a shame because the food really was good. That's why it gets 3 stars...the food was probably close to 5...service a 2."}
{"text":"Graduation weekend, Sunday night.
We were trying to go to Graze which was closed. So my daughter called after 6pm for a 6:30 reservation. They don't take reservations more than an hour out. 
That's fine, but why didn't they tell us the place was dead and we didn't need a reservation. So my elderly mother waited another 45 minutes to walk into the place with only ONE other table seated. And only one other table seated after us.
And if they were that slow, why was our fish and chips really dark brown( shy of burnt) and dry? 
My mother didn't want to make a big deal since it was a dinner for my daughter's graduation, but we won't be returning. How hard is it to mess up Fish and Chips.
My daughter's Mac and Cheese was okay, tasted alright but watery.  I can't remember what my son-in-law order, so it wasn't outstanding."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch with the family. Their kids menu is good, with actual dishes, not just heated up frozen food.  I had the Reuben. It was a bit huge, but very tasty.   The service was a little slow, and they were not crowded, so that's the reason for 4 stars. We ate outside. The tables out there are wobbly, making it a little difficult for the kids."}
{"text":"Was in Madison on business.  Went out and couldn't find what I was looking for for dinner, so I ended up here.  Atmosphere is OK.  It was nice, so the patio was full.  Inside was a little quite, but that's fine for a June Wednesday...

I sat at the bar and was approached quickly by the bartender.  Good beer.  Tried some local brews, and they aren't bad. 

Ordered the pan seared walleye for dinner.  It was delicious.  Perfectly cooked, lightly breaded, and yum- capers.  

The menu is full of delicious looking things, so I'll likely be back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I have returned to Brocach's because of the fine ambience and customer service.  This time we sat outside with a glass of wine and took in the beautiful view of the capital and all the activity on the street.    Our waitstaff was friendly and helpful.  A bit slow but they were busy and we wern't in a hurry so really didn't matter.  Inside is pub like and cozy."}
{"text":"I would put Brocach's fish fry in my top 5 favorites in Madison. It wasn't too soggy and I like their tartar sauce, which had a lot of flavor. There's a generous portion of fries to go with the fish, and the coleslaw is not your average coleslaw. I had a Dublin mule to go with my meal and was not disappointed with the size or strength of the drink. 
My date for the night had the bangers and mash. While she hadn't had bangers and mash before, she left saying that because of Brocach's, she'll have high standards going forward!  She also appreciated that they served non-alcoholic beer. 
When we went on a Friday night, they had live Irish music which was a nice touch to our evening. We were far enough away from the band that we could still have a conversation. That, along with people watching in the window, made for an enjoyable date night indeed, and all for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's bachelorette party a few weeks ago.  Love that they have small areas for groups to have their own space, so we were able to play some bachelorette games without disturbing other guests.  We were also able to bring in our own cake. 
Moscow mule here was well made and well worth the price.
I ordered the fish and chips and was super happy with my choice.  Fish was cooked right and the tartar sauce was fabulous.  Just wish I had more to go with the fish!  I asked for more, and by the time the waiter remembered I had asked, I was finished eating.
Because of the party, we had a limited menu, so I'd love to come back and be able to choose from the full menu."}
{"text":"Great beer cheese dip.  Irish Stew and corn beef and Cabbage were wonderful.  You know how some Irish-American restaurants \"americanize\" their Irish food?  That is not this place.  Very authentic flavor and presentation."}
{"text":"Some really really bad service. Not many people here, so it's not like the server was busy. Asked for a spicy Bloody Mary and was told 'why don't I bring the Tabasco and you can spice it yourself?' Then he brought the drink without Tabasco. Coffee was brought without any request for cream or sugar. Potatoes were excellent though."}
{"text":"In my crusade to find the best fish fry in Madison, my partner Jason O. referred me to the Brocach's Friday Fish Fry Special. For a mere $14, they serve an all-you-can-eat fried fish special. 

As soon as you walk into this restaurant (especially on a live music night) you feel like you've just walked into some Lord of the Rings tavern expecting Aragorn to eye you as you are seated. The atmosphere is very warm and very stereotypically Irish.

Although the service was a bit inattentive and slow, when the fish came out, it was fantastic. The batter was well seasoned on these generous planks of fish. The chips portion was good as you didn't get completely full on potatoes so that you could have more fish! The coleslaw was interestingly different as it was seasoned with some curry powder and included raisins mixed into the cabbage and mayonnaise mixture. I didn't really care for their tartar sauce as it seemed lacking in flavor, but that missing flavor was made up by the delicious fish. 

If you're hungry and have the appetite for a huge plate(s) of fish and chips, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm amazed this this place doesn't have a higher rating on Yelp. 
I've been here a few times now, and it's been fantastic every time. Today I went in with my mom who is a really picky eater (sorry Mom!), so she usually asks for modifications to her order. She's not from Wisconsin, and she gets pretty excited about cheese curds when she comes out here (who doesn't, right?). When we went in today, we saw that their cheese curds are not on their brunch menu! We asked our server, and she said it wouldn't be a problem to make them for us. We had curds in less than 5 minutes!
I ordered the corned beef hash and it was absolutely delicious. I was a little afraid of the horseradish sauce, but it was perfect, and not over the top at all. I always get my eggs cooked over medium, but 90% of the time restaurants still only cook them over easy. Brocach actually cooked them over medium!
My mom ordered the French toast sans walnuts, and it was great. 
Both of our portions were huge, and we ended up with boxes to bring home. 
They have a great draft beer list, and I love the décor/ambiance in here. Our service was perfect as well. There is not one thing that could have been better! The same is true of my previous visits. Even the food on the menu that I wouldn't order myself has been great (bangers and mash, shepherd's pie). I'm a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"While I still cannot pronounce this place- it doesn't matter as all you have to say is that you are going to the \"Irish place\" and everyone pronounces it for you. But if you are a trivia nut like me- Brocach is Irish for Badger Den- now how appropriate is that for a bar located in downtown Madison home of the Wisconsin Badgers??! 

On the night we were here -it was hot and humid. We opted to sit outside with an excellent view of the Capital but until the sun went down, it was pretty warm. The patio consists of 6 or so bistro tables but check inside with the host first if you plan to sit out there. Inside- there is a long, dark wood bar and plenty of tables between the two rooms. 

We ordered beer and a Meze platter which was basically two kinds of hummus, warm pita points, feta cheese and a small artichoke and tomato salad. Perfect for a hot night although hardly Irish. 

But if Irish food is what you want- they have it here. Shepard's pie, Fish and Chips, Bangors and Mash, Irish stew- all the favorites are on the menu. They also have a wide range of imported beers, and a good selection of unusual Irish and Scotch whiskeys. According to the bartender- they also have Irish music on select nights. 

So the next time you are little for a little \"green\" on the \"Square\"- check out Brocach. Best Badger Den I've ever set foot in!"}
{"text":"Any place that offers happy hour every day is a winner in my book!

We stopped here to meet with some friends who were checking out a nearby store.  What a great little spot!  

We had some excellent service by our bartender, as well as the manager.  They were both friendly and took time to talk with us while we waited for our friends to arrive.  

I HIGHLY recommend the Bear Republic Scotch Ale if they have it available.  Man.  That one went down a little too quickly for me.  I couldn't keep my lips off of the glass.  SO good.

I really like their sangria, as well.  They make it to order, which is pretty awesome; so, you know it is fresh.  What stood out to me with theirs is that it was more on the dry side.  Some sangrias are too sweet.  This was not.  It definitely made it feel more refreshing while drinking it.

We ordered some appetizers, as well.  They were great!  Not to mention that they came out super fast, which is always helpful when you're borderline hangry, as we were.

The bathrooms were clean, but what I noticed, of course, were the red metallic painted walls in the ladies room.  Definitely photo worthy.

I will be recommending this place whenever my friends are looking for a place to get together!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: fun Irish bar.

Brocach on the Square gets points for the following:

1) putting up with our giant, rowdy (intoxicated) group
2) serving delicious cheese and sausage apps
3) having Lagavulin 16
4) understanding"}
{"text":"Great comfort food at reasonable prices. Quality craft cocktails without pretense. Will revisit."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Saturday. I decided to try the fried chicken Benedict. It was splendid."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Brochah yesterday--my first time since they remodeled.  It was Friday and I had fish and chips.  The fish and french fries were excellent!  I am giving it 4 stars because it's a little over-priced (my fish and chips were $14 but I got a lot of food and maybe that is a typical price for downtown Madison).  The menu is limited and hopefully they will expand it."}
{"text":"This place is UNBELIEVABLE. it's osteria papavero and gastropub in one!!!!!! Omg, if you've been to the branch at the Capitol, this is a totally different restaurant. They don't share a menu, and the food is WAYYYYYYYYY better. 

You can make reservations for big groups and by the table are HUGE sofa booths, very very nice to sit. Not so convenient for getting out if you're on the inside, but that's too bad for those who didn't realize the negative points in exchange for the good view :p

Food:
DUCK FAT FRIES. how can anyone not have this on the menu!!! oily little wedges.
Seafood risotto - soooooooooo good. best I ever had
Shepherd's pie - so huge you have to eat it for several meals (females and small appetites only)

Here, go ahead, go share my new favorite restaurant. Everyone leaves satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch with my wife here.  The food menu is not very large (one sheet - front and back), but it has a lot of traditional items on it, and they offer a daily special if you feel like saving some cash.  The drink menu was quite a bit larger than the food menu (part of being a \"pub\" I suppose), but I was unable to sample off of it due to having to return to work.  Food was surprisingly very good for the simple dish that I ordered.

The environment definitely works - it's basically what I imagined in my mind's eye of what a traditional Irish pub would be, which I (sadly?) picture being like The Prancing Pony from the Lord of the Rings.  Large wooden booths, dimly lit, a little dingy, almost castle-like.  At first when you walk in it seems almost *too* dimly lit, like a dungeon, but eventually you adjust to it and it normalizes.

Will probably return sometime in the future to try some more traditional items off of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection. The ladies tending bar have always been friendly and cheerful. One guy who bartended was kind of a gruff sourpuss, but other than that the atmosphere here is great."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place.  The Irish food at this place is absolutely fantastic and definitely holds a candle to the food I've had in Dublin and Galway.  The atmosphere is top notch, and they have a decent selection of beers on tap (I think it was 12ish?).  

Price is more than other places in Madison, but it's not outrageous since food/drink seems to be cheaper in the area overall!  $12-15 for a main dish."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious Irish food! The wait staff is incredibly helpful in making decisions. My partner loved the cottage pie and I had the fish and chips. Everything was very flavorful (more than other \"Irish\" bars for sure). Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our original plan to have brunch at a different restaurant around the corner was met with a line out the door and a potential wait of 1.5 hours... so we decided on this place instead. The decor was quaint and exactly what you would expect from an Irish pub, and there were hardly any people in there at all! We were seated immediately at a big wooden table right next to a fireplace, which was the perfect thing for a sub-zero morning. Our server was kind and attentive even though he was very young - and he was knowledgeable about both the menu and the day's specials. I ordered the corned beef hash - IT WAS HEAVENLY. Real thick cuts of corned beef sauteed with onions, served on a bed of amazing roasted crispy potatoes. None of this dog food nonsense served from a can - oh, no. This was sumptuous, savory, and not overly salty either. Honestly the best corned beef hash that I've ever had! I will absolutely be coming back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Being from the UK, I find the concept of Irish themed Bars a little baffling, but really liked this one! They didn't only serve Irish beers, but had a nice little selection of local brews, which made it all the more unique.

It was a very dead night in Madison (we think all the students must have gone home), so we sat outside and enjoyed wonderful views off the capital building, which was all lit up and only steps away. 

All in all a pleasant evening with great drinks, decor and service!"}
{"text":"As someone who studied abroad in Dublin, I love a good properly-poured Guinness. And that's one of the best reasons to go to Brocach! The ambiance is that of a classic Irish pub, the food is good. Brocach won't change your life, but you're sure not to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am falling more in love with Monroe Street with every restaurant I try there. Brocach rocks. The ambiance is super cool and cozy, only complaint is I wish the place was bigger! We came in with a large party and had to wait about an hour. The bar area is a little small but the drinks made up for it. 

I tried the special Old Fashioned with ginger and it was delicious. We then tried a Scotch Egg for an appetizer which I thoroughly enjoyed. I had never heard of it before but can't wait to have another! For my meal, I had the apple brie sandwich with bacon with a side of greens. The sandwich was a little small for an entree, but the quality of the ingredients were top notch and the flavor was awesome. The salad was okay, but you got a lot of it to help fill you up from the small sammie. Overall, I'd order it again. 

Service was great, and our food came out fast. From what I've seen of the capitol location this place is much nicer. Can't wait to return to Monroe St. and Brocach!"}
{"text":"Man, other people really love Brocach on Yelp, huh? It's fine, if you invite me there I will totally go with you (so, not 8 Seasons Grille. I will not go there, no no no, you can't make me), but it's not as good as other places in the same price range in Madison, so why? Why are we going to Brocach? I've been there a bunch, to both locations, but I can't remember what I ate, what I drank or the servers. Because they were meh. I guess you want meh sometimes, so in those time, this could be a good choice."}
{"text":"Went here last night after a recommendation from a friend. Had a large group of 11 and they were very helpful with assisting us sitting altogether. The waitress, Kelly, was great. Very attentive, friendly, and split up our check individually without hesitation or any kinda of disgust (like I see at many other restaurants when asking to split up a large check). 
The appetizer came very quickly and was delicious! All the food was terrific as well and affordable prices as well. Great atmosphere, comfortable chairs, and less crazy busy than the one downtown. We will definitely be back here again in the very near future."}
{"text":"I have tried many of the items over time.  I don't have a favorite, but my favorites are the fish fry, bangers and mashed, and pork loin.  I know this is a pub, but the ambience is actually upscale without being hoity toity.  It is comfortable and casual.  Far beyond the location and the ambience is the food.  That is what keeps me coming back.  This is definitely my St Patties day destination (unless I'm in Boston).  Which says a lot.  The pork loin is not what I expected at a pub.  It is sophisticated and perfectly seasoned.  I have had it several times and it is always perfectly cooked.  The fish has an amazingly well seasoned crispy breading and a flaky tasty fish.  I like the fries too, one of my favorites.  The bangers are an awesome sausage.  The mash are somehow very good.  I don't know what they put in them, but they are a bit better than the rest."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in awhile but it's nice to know they decided to be a real Irish pub. Great live music tonight. The fish fry was good, the Guinness stew was good, the service was great."}
{"text":"We went to Brocach because a local girls' group was having a fundraiser there and they were giving 10% of their profits to a girls' group in Tanzania. We are eating paleo these days but I was happy to find shepherds pie on the menu and my husband had corned beef and cabbage with mashed potatoes. Our only complaint was there wasn't much cabbage in his dish. Our son had mac-n-cheese and we were pleasantly surprised that it was a small serving with equal sized sides, peas and corn and green apples. It was quite kid-friendly, noisy enough that I didn't think worry about our kids bothering anyone but not so loud that we had trouble hearing each other."}
{"text":"Wooohooo absolute incredible Irish pub!!! The bangers and mash are a must!!!! I love the whole vibe of the place. Order a Guinness (or 3) and some whiskey. I can't believe I haven't tried this place yet. Again the food alone will have you coming back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. Great price. If you're looking for a delicious and interesting place to eat around madison i would definitely recommend this place! I had the bangers and mash and it was very tasty. Mashed potatoes all day erry day"}
{"text":"Therese was great. The drinks were great. The food was great. Yes all around. We'd be regulars if we lived in Madison."}
{"text":"Therese was great. The drinks were great. The food was great. Yes all around. We'd be regulars if we lived in Madison."}
{"text":"Food was just overcooked and sat in the window for too long. The Irish coffee is usually good, but sucked when they were busy. They took the stuff we didn't eat and drink off the bill. Everyone was awkward and didn't know how to handle us. And we got walked past empty tables and sat at some tiny table next to the kitchen"}
{"text":"Amazing pub food. We got one of everything shareable for the table. The plow mans lunch was amazing as was the meat and cheese board."}
{"text":"The last time I went here I was served sweet potato fries that gave me and five of my friends horrible diarrhea. Instant one star for lack of proper food safety.

They were delicious though."}
{"text":"I had a Dublin burger, and a Steela beer. Food and drink  was Ok. The enviornment is great!  The people, the decor and my waitress are friendly. Just feel comfortable to be there. Certainly a place to drink again!! hahaha.."}
{"text":"I've been to Brocach for the past few weekends and keep wanting to come back!  It's got a great vibe and is full of a variety of people- from the suits enjoying the end of their workweek to older students in jerseys and jeans.

Last night, I ordered a drink and didn't realize it came with a cherry (which I'm allergic to).  I mentioned something to the waiter and he immediately went back to the kitchen to check the cherry type, then remade my drink and brought it right back.  The entire time, he was super nice and even apologized for not mentioning that it came with a cherry, even though I should've been the one who asked him!  He served us with a smile and was very accommodating, even though the place was pretty crowded.

I definitely recommend it as a great place to relax and be around a bunch of welcoming people, customers and staff alike."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch mid-week in mid-December. I don't know much about Irish food, but thought it might be fun to try a couple of Irish brews. The decor was interesting. Plush seats on one side of a table and wooden chairs on the other side. Or wooden benches on one side of a table and plush chairs on the other. Everything seemed a little dark and heavy with lots of reds.

Our waitress was attentive and quick. I ordered a couple of beers from the beer list, unfortunately they were out of both of them. Our waitress recommended a substitution. It was fine, but not Irish.

For lunch I tried the poutine. It came with thick cut fries, cheese curds, and Shepherd's Pie filling. The fries were as-described - very thick cut. There were a lot of them and definitely tasted of potato. They really could have used more salt, pepper, or the Shepherd's Pie filling to give them some flavor. The cheese curds were a little jarring. I expected them to be warm and molten but they were cold bites surrounded by lots of potatoes. The Shepherd's Pie filling was delicious. Chunks of tasty root vegetables and a thick warm sauce. I really wish there had been more of this to truly cover all of those thick-cut fries.

I'm not going to rush back, but I'd give it another try and definitely order something different, maybe the regular Shepard's Pie?"}
{"text":"Their burgers... yuuuuuum! You honestly can't go wrong with any of their burgers. 

On top of that, they make a mean Shepard's Pie, do a great Fish N' Chips and serve some delicious soups. 

Oh, and not to mention, they have a pretty extensive drinks list. 

I get it, Madison, you have some amazing pub food. Now if only there were more Chinese options..."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends on a Monday evening and we all really enjoyed the food. Everyone started with the potato leek soup. It had a nice, light flavor and while it didn't necessarily stand out for me, it made for a nice start to my meal. I also sipped on a Manhattan and a Cha Cha Cha while I waited for my entree, the bangers and mash. I had to order it after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp and I was very pleased! Each component of the dish tasted well on its own and came together for a very flavorful, well balanced meal. Everyone else was happy with their orders, which were the Irish stew and fish and chips. The service there was pretty spot on, but it wasn't too busy either considering the day. Either way, I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The chef's banger and mash was certainly not worth $17. The mash potato was cold, the cilantro as garnish looked like it was days old. The sausage certainly was not extraordinary!!! Our waitress served us one time and never asked us if we needed refills. A lunch for 3 costs us $42. Most definitely not worth our money. One of us had the cod sandwich special which was okay. The best I guess was their grilled cheese sandwich and that as well wasn't the best. All in all, not going there again!!!!"}
{"text":"Got ripped off majorly here. Unprofessional service and indifferent staff. Disappointed because of nice ambience."}
{"text":"Early Saturday evening service and it's not all too busy upstairs. Waitress was unsure of beers and never did bring that water we requested. The salmon came raw in the center. Too bad she forgot to tell us it came that way unless requested all the way done.  Sent it back to finish cooking it. Annoying wait....Tried to order donuts for dessert but they were out. It's 6pm and they're out of dessert?  Not.coming.back."}
{"text":"Shame when a pub uses cheater pints.  Cheater pints being the industry term for 14oz glasses, and advertising pints.  OTOH, service was prompt, food was great.  Braised beef, house IPA."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars/restaurants in Madison for sure.  The food is not light,  which is to be expected of Irish fair, so leave the light attitude at home.  Happily large portions with reasonable prices!

The beer cheese over grilled bread was fantastic,  so long as they grill it to be crispy.  I have encountered soggy grilled bread on one occasion,  but still tasty, so I forgive them!

I loved the pairing of corned beef with the horseradish cream sauce which added a really velvety texture and tied the entire plate of meat and veggies together.  The bangers and mash are the best I have ever had, granted I'm a wisconsinite not of Irish heritage.  My favorite dish at Brocach is the fish and chips.  Eight ounces of fresh Atlantic cod in a beer batter with tarter sauce sure makes me happy.  The fish was flaky, moist and perfectly fried.   Although I can see why not everyone enjoys their chips/fries, I'm a fan.  They are sliced and quartered potatoes that are fried pretty dark, so there is a great crisp to them.  You will leave happy, content and full!

Great beer and booze selection!  If you're looking for a nice refreshing cocktail, I personally enjoy French 75's, and Brocach makes a great one!

I am a total fan of this place and will always come back when I have the chance."}
{"text":"I hope we hit Brocach on an off night. On a Wednesday during happy hour we tried the slider flight and were surprised that all 4 sliders were awful--some were overcooked, some had flavorless or slightly rancid ingredients, and all of them were poorly seasoned. The parmesan garlic fries were served in what even grease lovers like us had to agree was just too much grease, though the fries themselves had great texture and--when you got the too-strong garlic off--good flavor. The potato leek soup was thin, without any of the richness or flavor I would have expected."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner and atmosphere.  I was doubtful of the possibility of eating healthy in an Irish pub (or in the midwest, for that matter) but they actually had a good selection of creative, fresh salads, in addition to yummy looking meaty pub fare.  It felt immediately authentic as the host who seated us talked with an Irish brogue.  The large stuffed chairs and decorations on the walls made it feel as if we were in someones home (or castle.)  Great place for an out-of-towner to stop!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, cheese curds, shepherds pie, and bangers mash all great! Wait staff...superb. We came in on a Tuesday night, 5 mins before kitchen closed, and all was great!"}
{"text":"I was sad to see the Milwaukee version of this place close down....So when I saw there was still a location open in Madison I got excited and suggested we go here for a work dinner.  

However, the interior of the restaurant felt a bit dirty, and the food was average. 

That is with exception to the cheese curds. We were impressed with how lightly breaded they were and not heavy at all. 

I had salmon for my meal and it tasted a bit too fishy for me. The others were not super impressed with their meal either. 

I do remember us being impressed with the beer selection so thats good! I am a sucker for a Smithwicks on tap :)"}
{"text":"Food wasn't exciting, but at least I could buy a Magner's Cider."}
{"text":"Tried the cheese curds and shepherds pie; both were delicious. Fun, relaxing atmosphere and great draft beer selection. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food!!! One of my favorites in Madison!  I always get the meze platter and caeser salad but everything else i've had there has been great.  (And the baileys cheesecake is the best dessert you'll ever have)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times while staying at the Inn On the Park nearby.  Tonight I ordered a \"Dublin\" burger.  It was kind of terrible.  Meat was cold, sauce was colder and overly sweet, and it was missing the mushrooms and bacon advertised.  Just...nothing.  Had a salad with it that included fishy-tasting Caesar dressing.  One of my friends had shepherd's pie which he described as tasting \"like a hamburger with peas in it.\"  Service was adequate.  Overall, not impressive.  Dunno if I'd willingly go back."}
{"text":"Dude... for a pub, the food here is superb.

No joke, I have had every single one of the Irish specialties on Brocach's menu, even the vegetarian shepherd's pie (and I'm a meat lover). They are usually both quality and quantity. So if you go to here, you can probably pick anything in that section and it'll be a safe bet that you'll be satisfied (maybe not, since you'll probably want to come back and try the other stuff). I'm also a fan of the Irish Stew. It's an interesting and original dish, with beef, lamb, and veggies cooked in Guinness broth. Give it a shot if you're brave.

Sadly, I haven't had anything other than the Irish specialties, but I'm sure the other stuff is good too."}
{"text":"We came here with a good sized group right after the Badger vs Minnesota game. We called ahead and made reservations just as the game let out.  We all hung out in the bar area before our table was ready. The bar is good sized and very well stocked both with a lot of beers and friendly bartenders.

We were seated fairly quickly considering how busy of a rush they had gotten with the game letting out. I cannot say enough about our waiter. He was quick, informative about the menu and even snuck in a joke or two. Very fun and friendly while giving great service.

For food I had a scotch egg as an  which looked amazing and tasted just as good. For the meal I ordered the Hail Mary burger, at the recommendation of our server, which delivered in a big way. This burger is stacked high and huge! The kitchen prepared it exactly the way I requested and the flavors were great. If I absolutely had to throw in a gripe it would be on the fries. Pretty positive they are the pre made frozen kind when put up agains the rest of the food they just don't quite measure up. For my preference I like firm/crispy fries and these are softer, that can be boiled down to personal preferences. Again our server was quick with the beverages and had a great memory.

We were in and out in about and hour and half with a table of nine directly after a huge Badger football home game. The food was great, the service was better. I'm not sure what more you could ask for. Monroe street strikes again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have only been here for drinks but they do have a good selection of whiskey, of course Irish beer and some drink specials."}
{"text":"I've been to Brocach plenty of times over the years, but hadn't been for months until recently. I can't really remember having a bad meal, and usually enjoy the food.

The downtown location is looking a little rough, and could really use some updating. That peeling paint on the ceiling of the bar area looks pretty terrible.

The meal I had the other night consisted of a cup of potato leek soup (always delicious) and a couple handful of my friend's decked-out fries, which were fine. Another friend's fish sandwich look alright, but he said the curry sauce was dreadful and the fish was mediocre. He struggled to finish it. A pulled pork sandwich was also ordered, which was fine and dandy.

Will probably stop back in the future. I've had their shepherd's pie a few times, and it was always good. A few of my friends have had birthday shindigs at the downtown location over the years, and it's always been a good time.

It's a bit pricey, but a decent option."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday during the Farmer's Market with family, and so glad we did. 

The Restaurant has so much character and ambiance, the Menu is a traditional Bar/Irish pub menu with lots of options.

My father in law had the fish and chips which looked great and he raved about. My wife and I shared the poutine which was great.

Service wasn't great but wasn't terrible either. We will definately come back."}
{"text":"I didn't really think of Brocach as a brunch place, but we went there and I had the basic breakfast with scrambled eggs, saussage and potatoes. It solid, not creative or inventive but good."}
{"text":"Big portions, great great great waiter service. 

Ordered a roast chicken with sweet corn stuffing. They gave me an entire chicken half.  The leftovers lasted two more meals."}
{"text":"Brocach means \"badger den\" in gaelic.  We wondered if there were any badgers in Ireland... lest you doubt, check out the good folks at http://www.badgerwatch.ie/ doing their best for badger preservation.  Cute pics too.   

Irish-American comfort food... you may get pretty comfortable after a pint or two and then some cheese dip (well, we ARE in Wisconsin) and hearty selections like shepherd's pie (wife-endorsed) or the house signature burger - come on, needed some more CHEESE to top off that BEEEEF! (in no way diminishing the desire to visit Fromagination)

Friendly service, nice vibe, captured the feel of Irish pubs.  Perfect for all badgers, students and otherwise of all stripes."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food is actually good tho. I gave 1 star because it's super slow. What happened was that we went on Friday night. There are a couple tables. I guess there are two servers on that day. We picked unlimited Fish, deep fried and baked. The food came after 20mins. We didn't ask for more right away until we finished it. Then we ask for more. It took 20mins to get two more prices. We order more and this time the waiter seemed to forget our order since she came to ask if we want a bill. We were like NO we didn't even have enough food. We wait another 15 mins. The fish was very small. So we ordered more. This time we asked for 2 pieces each. I felt like I have to beg for food. They advertise 'unlimited' fish. But the way they do is not quite right. Try to serve it slow. Make me feel like we have to beg for food that we actually gonna pay for it. Bad business."}
{"text":"Classic Irish pub. The food was OK+ and staff were great, and oddly the special was fish tacos, which were good. Everyone at my table got them (hah!). Great service, whisky selection looked replete (couldn't indulge over lunch but would over dinner!)."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this restaurant last night while wandering downtown. We were a party of four and were able to be seated right away. The waitress was friendly and offered suggestions. We ordered drinks which were okay. The food on the other hand was delicious! We ordered cheese curds, fish, a couple burgers and Mac n cheese. All of which received our stamp of approval and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is just not the place for me.  I usually give a restaurant at least three tries before they go on my \"never to return\" list.  This one is on that list.  I don't know if it is just the deeply irish menu or what but I was never able to stomach anything I ordered.  Understand, many of my mates who dined with me liked it and return.

The atmosphere is great.  Decor, inviting.  Service and staff were fine, but nothing I remember as being mind blowing.  

It really just boiled down to the food that was either cold, bland or fatty.  It was unappetizing to look at much less eat.

Oh, and as much as I love being culturally minded, the bag pipes really do set my teeth on edge.  lol

Having said all that, this is a very personal review and one that simply means I won't be going back for a fourth visit."}
{"text":"Well I had looked so forward to returning to this bar after having such a great experience here about 6 yrs ago. Alas we were disappointed. One of the main reasons we came back was for their martini made with pineapple infused vodka. What a disappointment- I could hardly taste the pineapple, there was no sugar on the rim and the glass was tiny. Service was awful however part of that was bc it was our server's 2nd day on job. We were willing to cut him some slack but you would think they would hire someone with some common sense. We decided to order food and he appeared to make up answers which he later had to come back and correct himself. Their website description of Friday fish fry didn't match what was offered when there in person. I got the fish and chips.  It was good but expensive compared to other fish fries in the area. The rest of bar staff could also use lessons in customer service- don't let drinks sit on bar for 5 min waiting for waiter if you have time to walk the drinks to our table. I will say there was 1 guy who did try to make out visit a little better but could be more proactive when sees mistakes being made."}
{"text":"Just across the street form the picturesque Wisconsin State Capitol, proudly sits the little-big restaurant that could. From its' outsized and colorful lively décor to the background irish fiddle music playing throughout your lunch, a better meal to be had by visitors and residents of Madison would be hard to come by. Personable service and good food took the chill off the winter midday outdoors. The fish and chips were expertly prepared and would rival anything this side of London. A very good place to pop in and sit a spell."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to stopping it to see the newly remodeled Brocach on the square for awhile now and finally was able to last weekend. The interior atmosphere is wonderful and looks really nice. Overall, my experience was definitely good, but I just wanted to express my grave disappointment in how my wine was served. Now, I understand that wine is not Brocach's forte and not really what their focus is on, but choosing to serve their wine in a basic glass that looks like a water glass is really unenjoyable. Especially if I'm eating greasy cheese curds with my fingers. It was gross. Every restaurant should have basic red/white wine glasses. Especially if you're a pub/bar."}
{"text":"Went on a tues....half price bottles.  Bartenders are very knowledgeable and gave good reccommendations and if possible, gave me tastes too which she felt matched my pallate."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that impressed with this place. The atmosphere seemed alright, but the waitstaff seemed uninterested and slow moving. That and it was rather expensive for just a Spotted Cow. I don't live in Madison anymore, but when I do go back, I doubt I'll come here."}
{"text":"Brocach was just what I needed to satisfy my fill of Irish ambiance. Thankfully I had Yelp to rely on while searching for Irish grub last week.  Carol K.'s review peaked my interest and did not disappoint.  Thank you Carol K.!

We were there on a Tuesday night hoping to enjoy good Irish food and traditional Irish music.  We didn't get the live Irish music (not surprising on a Tuesday night), but we listened to Irish music piped throughout the restaurant while enjoying our Irish dinner and traditional Irish beverages.  

Cait was our waitress and was on point with her recommendations and timely check-ins.  Cait shared the drink specials which allowed us to have more of what we originally requested (plus an extra shot of whiskey for another $1!).  This was such a good deal that I'm sharing the breaksdown of this special.

DRINKS:
Husband's Irish beverage of choice:
 -Guinness - reg. $5.25 (half-pints available for $3.75)
 - John Powers - reg. $5.25 (2 oz. shot of Irish Whiskey)
*Special = $6.25 for a pint of Guiness and shot of John Powers

Wendy's Irish beverage of choice:
 - Jameson and coke is what I requested; however, Cait's recommendation was to take advantage of the *half-priced Irish Whiskey & Scotch special and upgrade to the 18 yr. Jameson with a coke on the side.  It was perfect...and I only had to cough up $6.00!

FOOD:
My husband enjoyed the shepards pie and said it was good, but needed more meat, veggies, and gravy to go along with the heap of mashed pototoes. He can't wait to come back and try the Irish Stew.  I ordered the fish and chips.  You can't go wrong with Harp battered haddock filets. Everything was very fresh and with just enough fish and a good portion of \"chips\". I probably ate too many of the chips since they were really good and I can't stop once I start eating them with the malt vinegar.  Certain meals are served with brown bread and I think it would be a nice touch for them to include Kerry Gold butter on the side. It's from Ireland and it's good...no need to elaborate.

MUSIC/AMBIANCE:
 - Music lineup is good if you can catch them on the right days and times.  
 - Live Irish music on various evenings...approx. 7 nights per month.
 - Great ambiance with traditional feel throughout the restaurant and pub area.  
 - There is also a second floor (which I did not go up to) and you can view an interior balcony area from the first floor of the restaurant.

TIPS: 
 - Check out the music lineup on my photo (as of Nov. 2011).  It is not on their website.
 - Happy Hour is every day 3-6PM and 10PM - Close
 - All you can eat Fish Fry on Friday's.  $15 from 4:30 - 10PM
 - I saw a sign in the restroom that promoted Private Parties with no party room charges.
 - Trivia night: Sunday @8PM w/ drink specials and prizes
 - Brocach is pronounced BROH-kaw
 - Parking can be tricky.  Some meters have 15 min limits or 1 hour limits, but will take all of your coins if you drop them in the meter.  I was a little confused since our meter indicated a 15 min limit with a 1.5 hour max time.  

I will definitely be returning to Brocach whenever I'm in Madison.  Hopefully, the Irish bands will coincide with my schedule. I'd also be interested in trying them out for breakfast sometime. My standards are pretty high for a proper Irish breakfast...so Brocach, I hope you're ready!

Sláinte!"}
{"text":"I love me some good Irish pub food, and Brocach fits the bill.  As a fan of the Milwaukee location, I was glad to see that the Madison spot offers equally tasty fare.  They accommodated our group of 8 with reservations during a busy conference in the area, which was great.  It was a slight headache to explain split checks to the waitress, as they have a policy against splitting beyond a certain number.  Thankfully, it worked out easily enough.  I ordered the potato leek soup, which was surprisingly delicious.  I probably could've made an entree out of that alone.  However, I paired it with the Rachel (turkey Reuben), which was so, so, so good.  Great food, beautiful location right on the Capitol Square, and helpful staff.  Worth visiting again."}
{"text":"I think I'll hold all Irish pubs to this standard.  I had an excellent time, and an excellent dinner of bangers and mash.  Excellent decor... it felt historic.  Great service, and the other patrons (looked like it attracted many of the suit-wearing capitol types) weren't loud or obnoxious on a Wednesday night.  I know I'd stop in there at least a few times per year if I still lived in Madison.  It's in a pretty convenient location downtown."}
{"text":"The new Brocach is wonderful!! Interior design is fresh and in great taste. The Lobster Roll was wicked good and my hubs said the burger is now his favorite in Madison. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"One of the first things that overwhelms you when you walk in the door, is that is actually resembles an Irish pub without being a cheesy impostor. There are comfy, oversized booths as well as some of the largest wooden tables/chairs.  

The menu is inventive and every time i've been there, all diners have been satisfied with their choices.  Whether it be the fish n chips, salmon, or dublin city burger (topped with the besssst onion rings) Brocach knows how to please their guests.

There is often irish bands playing, or at least a harp and bagpipes.  

The upstairs boasts a swanky lounge/bar that also offers an awesome view of the capital.  Prices are bit steep for drinks if you are a student, but compared to other nicer places near the capital, Brocach is a great deal."}
{"text":"I love this place- overall great food and great service. However the sloppy joe needs to be taken off the menu. The sloppy joe tastes like an over spiced attempt at making an American Classic a little more interesting. I would throw this in the trash if I made it at home.
I will continue to come back- Brocach is top notch. But that sloppy joe man- don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"One thing you need to know about me - I don't like Brocach. Like for real.

It's pretty boring, and feels so manufactured- maybe its the stucco on the walls, the fake irish decor, or the $6 Guinness', but I sigh every time that I get suckered into going here. Give me a break.

Two redeeming qualities: they have a scotch egg on the menu :) and their brunch is fairly legit with BOGO bloodies on sundays (I think)"}
{"text":"Delicious food - lots of vegetarian options. I highly recommend their vegetarian shepherd's pie, which is nearly impossible to finish. Perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the food, but the bar is cool as hell.  The service was impeccable and the waiter kept the black and tans coming all night.  He also had some good suggestions for microbrews as well.  Knowledgeable staff and good service = \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"Food is good, drinks are normal-priced, and it is a good place to go with larger groups because they have such large tables- the best part, though, is the happy hour!

Half-price on all whiskey/scotch over $7, Guiness and a shot of Bushmills for $6, and buffalo wings for 25 cents each- unbeatable!  only drawback is that happy hour is only from 4-6pm, so plan ahead to get there with enough time to enjoy this!"}
{"text":"Very interesting atmosphere here. Super dark, tall ceilings. We had a friendly server (totally bored because the place was dead) and my husband and I both ordered the salad special. It was yummy, and huge, and the drinks were strong (like everywhere else in Madison). It was the middle of the week and were practically the only patrons. I'd be interested to see what they are like on the weekend."}
{"text":"I ate here three times in a week it was that delicious. Twice for lunch with colleagues and once for brunch with the family. Every single bite was delicious from the green salad to the squash soup to the French toast to the scramble. Service was equally as great - chef was very accommodating. I've eaten here in the past and it wasn't nearly as good - there must be a new chef and definitely a new menu. I will go again and again, especially after seeing my 5 and 9 year old scarf down their food with big grins!"}
{"text":"As others have noted, the new space is very nice. It's definitely not an Irish Pub feeling by any stretch of the imagination but it's very nice. We were immediately greeted by a friendly host who seated us a by the window. The space was awkward for two people so I don't think I'd like to sit there again. The table was also just small enough that while it fit our drinks and food, it felt super cramped. I spent much of the meal worried I was going to knock something off of the table. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was fine. Nothing bad, but nothing super outstanding either. I had the fish fry off the menu and the bf had the Friday night fish fry special which featured three different types of fish. His was definitely the better of the two--his fish was much fresher than mine. He is a bit of a health nut so was a bit off put by the LARGE bed of fries the fish was served on but I think most people wouldn't mind, yours truly included :) The Guinness was fairly fresh but my Old Fashioned was just meh. It's a nice space but there is much better food and drink to be had elsewhere on the Square."}
{"text":"I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really like this place.

I'm not one for Irish Pubs, really. I mean Guiness is alright and everything, but I much prefer an American craft stout generally speaking. And Irish food is pretty straightforward, right? Root vegetables and beef. That's what I thought.

I don't know how, but Brocach has completely changed my view on this point. Their bangers and mash were downright dream worthy, and the cool cave-y ambiance really struck a chord with me. 

It's got a nice location near the capital and they have a big projection screen so they can show movies for parties and whatnot. It's a good setup. Service is prompt and prices are only slightly more than what I want to pay. 

Given how the bangers and mash were so darn inventive, I don't even mind the slightly above-comfort cost."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Brochach Monroe 3 stars - it is one of my neighborhood places- but I can't.
I will start with the positive which is that the potato leek soup was some of best I have had: rich, but not too rich, and topped with real smoky bacon, parmesan and a parsley oil swirl.
The bread that accompanied it however was a worst of the worst Sysco white roll that was billed as 'petite sourdough'. I don't think so. No sourdough there. This roll was served ice cold on a frigid day with boring butter. I was dreaming of some Irish sweet butter.
It said to me that someone in the kitchen doesn't care.

I asked for a cup of hot water- instead of ice water -did I mention it was 2 degrees outside? and received a cup of clear hot water that tasted like it came out of the bottom of a dirty coffee pot. AGH! Really bad! and they were making tea from that hot water.

the place has a nice vibe and was comfy in a pubby sort of way. I will go back and try it again, it is in my 'hood after all."}
{"text":"Bangers n Mash. AMAZING. This is my first experience with Irish cuisine and I most certainly approve of Brocach. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant could be excellent because the food is solid, but as other reviewers have noted, the service can be pretty bad. This was our experience as well. The hostess and server were very polite and welcoming, but that was the only positive on the front end service. 

There were at least a couple of the typical awkward moments in unpolished service (in being seated, etc), but there was one big mistake worth describing. Our food was brought out in extremely poor timing, with my dining partner being served her soup and sandwich a good 25 minutes before I had even received my salad--which then came with my main all at once. The server brought the first dish out with no explanation. Only when questioned as to the whereabouts of my food, she explained that they'd had a \"mix-up\" in the kitchen and that my \"ticket\" was just reaching the kitchen staff. This I did not understand since we ordered our food together, presumably on the same ticket. And the restaurant was not terribly busy at the time--there were probably four or more open tables. The server did not offer to hold my partner's food or even apologize. 

We noted the delay (how long does it take to assemble a green salad?) and were comped the salad when it should have been the early food (a salmon sandwich more expensive than the salad) that should have been either comped, redone, or held. If they can't do the damage control right, then the management is sleeping.

I don't expect restaurants to always be perfect, but Brocach is not inexpensive. For their prices such big mistakes really should never happen. 

If you don't mind service that can be spotty like that, then by all means go there for some very decent food."}
{"text":"What Can I say about a True Irish Pub that brings you joy in the mouth, fullness of the tummy and keeps your wallet still intact.
I have frequented Brocach several times over the years, discovered impeccable lunches, celebratory dinners and outdoor patio adventures in the warm months. 
Brocach is a \"have to repeat that\" kind of pub. 
Personally I do love the Roasted Beet Goat Cheese salad with the Pistachio Vinaigrette . OMG  
We (meaning son, friends  etc) have experienced so many incredible dishes, fine Irish Whiskeys,true Black and Tans and some of the most Authentic Irish Cuisine this far from the Isle itself. 
Love the bartenders (some of the more fine things to behold in my opinion)  oh stop...and the Music..ambiance is unbeatable.
You must visit and experience. I insist. 
I leave you with this...

Some Guinness was spilled on the barroom floor
when the pub was shut for the night.
Out of his hole crept a wee brown mouse
and stood in the pale moonlight.
He lapped up the frothy brew from the floor,
then back on his haunches he sat.
And all night long you could hear him roar,
'Bring on the goddam cat!'

Sláinte!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by stating that I have lived in an Irish neighborhood and eaten my fair share of authentic Irish cuisine. I have been to this establishment previously and enjoyed the atmosphere and dinning experience.
I noticed that the Irish breakfast was no longer on the menu. I asked our server,  Stephanie, about it and was informed by her, after she looked for it, that they had a new executive chef and must have removed it from the menu.
Okay no big deal, I have eaten at plenty of Irish restaurants that did not have it on the menu. I found the bangers and mash. The menu stated it came with colcannon, mash potatoes with cabbage in it for those not familiar with the dish. It also had some kind of apple thing. When it arrived  the apples were all over it so as to not be able to taste the dish without tasting the apples, I hope this wasn't an effort to mask sub pare bangers or possibly just an ordinary sausage. I tried the colcannon only to find not a single piece of cabbage.
My dinner was very disappointing to say the least.
On top o the bad meal, the service was bad that evening as well. The waitress was unaware of an item being removed from the menu.
This place still has a great bar, with good music on Friday night. That is what allowed it to receive two stars.
I hope the new chef (or management) realizes that he shouldn't be trying to reinvent the wheel. Stick to the classic dishes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Brocach for seven years, since before they even employed \"Sinjin,\" everyone's favorite con artist (http://tinyurl.com/m8mer6t - for some reason, the article confuses the Brocach with the Claddagh; no wonder people aren't buying newspapers anymore). It's now my favorite place for bar trivia in Madison, though the drinks and food are fairly average.

First, the atmosphere. The bar has two stories, with several different seating areas and table/booth options, and an outdoor patio. It's a little dark, as a proper Irish pub should be, with heavy dark wood and plush padding on the seating areas. It can get loud on the weekends and during St. Patrick's Day, since there isn't much on the walls or ceiling to absorb the sound. The bathrooms are kept clean and well-stocked, and they even (finally) fixed the lock on the stall in the upstairs women's bathroom. The patio area is small and can sometimes seem cramped, and drunker patrons will sometimes smoke out there. It's normally not too bad as long as you're sitting indoors, but sometimes it wafts up and in through the second-story windows (which are open during nice weather), which is fairly unpleasant for a non-smoker like myself.

Second, the staff. They're great, absolutely one of the highlights of going there. They're very capable, and enforce certain rules when they need to do so. Marcos and Sam currently run Sunday night trivia, though Sam will be departing soon, and will be replaced by a long-time trivia regular. They're funny, friendly, and conversational, and they're great at knowing the regulars - Marcos always remembers to talk to me about the latest Lifetime Movies (a shared campy obsession of ours). The other night, I asked for a Diet Coke and Sam gave me a regular. I noticed immediately, and he profusely apologized and rectified the mistake right away. They also give great advice about the beer and scotch selections, and will pour beer samples if you're interested but unsure. Sam and Marcos do a phenomenal job of juggling trivia questions and answer grading, pouring drinks, taking orders for food, running out plates, and clearing away empty glasses and dishes, all at the same time - not easy! I've never had bad service here.

Third, the entertainment. Trivia is on Sundays. The teams with the best names each week get free whiskey shots for each of their players, and the names are one of the best parts of trivia night. The Brocach staff write their own questions, a welcome difference from the dreaded Team Trivia WI with its incredibly stupid 15-point final question. Their questions are interesting. Some rounds are weekly fixtures: current events, a picture round, a matching round, potpourri, and occasionally literature. They announce two of the trivia subjects each Sunday afternoon on their Facebook page, which is nice. They're also really responsive to questions posted on their wall as to whether a usually-scheduled event will be taking place on holidays. They do take requests for round topics, which is great! There tends to be more of an emphasis on pop culture and media, and somewhat less of a focus on sports, which my team loves. I've also been to open-mic nights, which are great. They do a great job with the artists; nothing too loud or grating. When one regular open-mic performer had an album coming out, the Brocach did a mini-album release party for him, which was great. Live Irish music nights are fun as well, though it can get fairly loud pretty quickly if you're near the band.

Fourth, the food and beverages. Both are somewhat overpriced, although the happy hour deals aren't bad. The potato leek soup and Greek chicken salad are fairly good, but not standouts. The lounge fries are addicting and delicious, and they're great for sharing in a group of 4-6. The beer cheese dip is pretty gross; I'd recommend avoiding it. Their corned beef (in both sandwich and with cabbage) is pretty knockout, as it should be at an Irish pub. The reuben is delicious, although a bit greasy. The thick-cut fries are great! The Brocach burger is serviceable, but the black bean burger can get pretty dry. My boyfriend is a big fan of the fish fry. Another favorite of mine is the shepherd's pie. I've never tried the main courses, though - they're comparatively very expensive. The servers are excellent at listening to order modifications. I have a friend who despises pickles, but I love them, so every time we go together, he asks to have his pickle put on a separate plate for me, and the server remembers! The tap beer selection is diverse and seasonal, but quite good, and there's always a beer on special for trivia nights. The scotch and Irish whiskey list is phenomenal (Old Midleton is insanely expensive and worth every penny when you drink it neat). The mixed drinks are fantastic, especially the Irish coffee, but a bit expensive for a regular night."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant near the Capitol for hanging out with friends and family. Prices are on the steep side, which isn't surprising given its prime location, but overall they deliver good food quality. For appetizer, I tried their wings and the fried cheese curds. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor and texture of the wings, but I loved the cheese curds, which are like little fried clouds of happiness. It's hard to eat just a few. For my main course I got the lobster mac and cheese, which is as rich and decadent as it sounds. It's served bubbling hot with large chunks of lobster. I would recommend giving this a try if you're in a comfort food type of mood and are prepared to crash on the couch afterwards."}
{"text":"Tasty Brunch with Big Portions

Jeff and I decided to try something sorta new but sorta familiar. We went to the newish Brocach on Monroe street for brunch.

Jeff had the Walnut Burger and I had the Benedict. Jeff's loved his sandwhich and thought the onion roll and artichokes were a good twist.

I also loved my Benedict but it was way too much to love. With two homemade biscuits, two eggs, two large ham steaks, two pieces of toast, a pile of potatoes, and a fruit cup, this meal could feed 3-4 people...seriously.

The coffee was decent and not offensive, but it wasn't one would hope for in a neighborhood containing many good, local coffee options.

Overall, good stuff."}
{"text":"They ruined it!  It used to be so cozy and unique.  Now it looks just like any other restaurant, nothing to set it apart.  Even worse, the food has gone downhill.  My husband ordered a beer, only to find out they were out.  Then I ordered a Reuben.  My first two bites were nothing but blubber.  Luckily, the following  bites were ok, but it wasn't a great flavor.  I decided to take the other half of the sandwich home, and was given a box.  I boxed the sandwich, and waited while my husband finished his mussels.  I kept getting a whiff of a bad smell.  My husband said he couldn't smell anything, which made me realize it was coming from the box under my nose.  It reeked!  When he smelled the box, he said it smelled like garbage.  I think it may have been made from recycled material, and unfortunately it still smelled like the garbage it was made from.  I knew my sandwich was probably soaking up that stench, so I did take it home, but only to give my dogs.  I noticed the couple that came in after us were commenting that some item they wanted was no longer on the menu either.  It's a shame when something that was great gets ruined by \"improvements\"."}
{"text":"Alright so this place was probably my favorite of the whole trip to Madison. First.. Murphy's. That is a DELICIOUS beer! Second.. Sheppard's pie. Awesome! Service is awesome, place has AC, great location.. Wish I could try more but alas, time limits. I had several delicious beers here that I will definitely remember!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner Saturday night early. Really miss the charm of the old decor. Was also looking forward to some leek soup. That's no longer on the menu. What I did order was very good - heritage tomato salad and farm soup. Hopefully they will be able to fix the slow serve as they settle in."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch. Services wasn't the best. Slow but friendly. Which ill take any day over I dont give a crap about my job attitude. Get out of the customer service industry then.

Alpha Mary- awesome garnishes and well seasoned & spiked. Worth the $10 price tag.

Bourbon Bacon Bloody- Wished I ordered two of this. Fun twist with the bourbon. It was also rimmed with a sweet/smoky blend of sugar and spices. I recommend ordering your mary with bourbon at least once if given the option.

Biscuit and Gravy - so from the look at the plate it looked like a whole lot food. Which is great if it actually tasted like complete comfort food. Biscuit where dry with no fluffy/flaky inside. The breakfast potatoes on the side where cold and not seasoned at all. Drowned them in ketchup. The dish also came with two eggs. I got them sunnyside. When i got the plate i thought they forgot my egg but then discovered they where on top of the biscuits under the gravy! WAYYYYY! If I would of known they do that i would have asked them to put them on the side. The sunny yolk flavor was lost under all the gravy. I love poking the yolk with a fork to see the yolk run and then scope them with the potatoes or toast. But did love that the gravy was made with whole slices of mushrooms and sausages rather then ground up. Also had an excellent rosemary flavor but again needed some salt and pepper. 

Now this the Monroe location. Been downtown location only for dinner. Still need to try their brunch. The menu a little different but hopefully their bloodies are the bomb.

The quest to try every Bloody and Biscuit & Gravy shall go on."}
{"text":"The best Fish Fry I have had. Good pieces of fish with a thin crisp coating. No skipping on the fish part. On Friday you can get All You Can Eat. The service was excellent and a great Irish atmosphere. Was dark and loud music is playing FYI."}
{"text":"We went into the newly remodeled Brocach last night to watch the end of the Cubs game....there were a few seats at the bar which was perfect.  The Guinness and Cider (from Michigan) were excellent and the new remodel looks awesome!  We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food but will def be back for a try.  The only drawback was that for a new remodel, the TVs were on the smaller side but maybe they're not going for a sports bar vibe.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Eh.  For the big Irish pub on the square, this is just average.  I like the ambiance.  It is a place to sit and have a pint while chatting with friends.  It never gets too loud.  Upstairs, the couches are fun, almost Alice in Wonderland inspired.  

Prices are a bit high, but if you happen to luck out for happy hour then you are golden.  They have happy hour everyday from 10pm to close.  It is a nice place to end your day and get a deal. 

I have had their food a couple of time.  It is ok.  I am just not overly excited about this place.  They always card. ALWAYS.  Kind of annoying because I am obviously over 21 and there creates this HUGE congestion at the door.  

I do not hate this place but I do not love it."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. My wife absolutely loves the pineapple martinis, they soak pineapple in vodka for like a week, it tastes like candy even though its straight vodka. The atmosphere is great too, it really feels like a legit irish bar in the middle of Madison. They also have an exceptional whiskey list, with a number of good scotches. They have a half off scotch promotion 10pm to close too, which is pretty amazing. Last thing to mention is the Dublin City Burger. Definitely one of the top burgers in the city. The guinness stout sauce is incredible, and the burger itself is juicy and delicious. Definitely get it if you have the chance."}
{"text":"We love Brocach!  We have eaten here several times, and I have loved it every time. I've just started exploring the world of drinking whiskey and rye, neat, and this restaurant has a good selection for my husband to teach me more about these drinks. I ordered the special tonight, which was corned beef and cabbage, seasonal as St. Patrick's Day is coming up.  It was delicious!  Their Shepherd's Pie, Walnut burger, and salmon BLT are other favorites of mine. I try to take guests there any chance I get."}
{"text":"3 of us stopped in for a few drinks on a trip to Madison. Ordered 3 drinks and 3 Waters. One  drink was ordered \"neat\" and it was brought out on ice. When this mistake was brought to the bartenders attention he was visibly upset... Made a new drink and delivered it without any further comment.... We never received our waters... Place was not busy but it was clear the bartender was upset that he had to work.... Upon paying our check there was no thank you or stop again....."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Brocach.  The place with the funnest name (which my friends and I usually yell out as \"BREAKAGE!\").

I guess it's not entirely fair of me to not rate this place higher, but I just wasn't impressed by their food the time I ate there.  It was passable, but just not anything spectacular.

I *do* like their bar upstairs for when I'm feelin' fancy.  They have excellent champagne cocktails on their menu (and if you know me, you know how I love to indulge in one of those).  The decor in the upstairs bar area is gorgeous, and is completed by quite the view of the Capitol building right outside the windows.  I'm never bothered by the clientele or the waitstaff.  The only problem is the steep drink prices!"}
{"text":"Had the Fish and chips, wife had the Shepard's Pie. Food was great. the NE Clam Chowder is awesome. We were in late, and the service was ok, but not fantastick"}
{"text":"I love Brocach ever since I discovered their corned beef and cabbage.  It's the best corned beef I've ever had.  Deliciously tender with streaks of melt in your mouth fatty goodness throughout.  It's paired with mashed potatoes and cabbage, and topped with slices of fried carrots.  The cabbage is cooked soft but not mushy.  The carrot slices give the dish a crunch.  It's their best dish, in my opinion, and I've certainly turned a couple of people who were previously meh to corned beef to realizing it's the best thing ever once they tried Brocach's version.  

The other thing I love about Brocach is the way they make my drink.  I often order a whiskey highball with ginger beer, splash of bitters, and lots of lemon.  Because I'm not particularly specific when I order this drink, it's different at every bar.  But no matter where I go, Brocach makes the best version of this drink.  I don't know if it's because of their whiskey (I ask for rail whiskey), their ginger beer, or their bitters, but this is definitely my favorite drink ever.  

Ooo, and their lounge fries are decadent and a little dangerous.  I always have to make sure there are several people to share them with or I end up eating way too much of it all by myself.  It's fries covered in cheese, bits of bacon, tomatoes, drizzled in some barbeque sauce and other delicious goodness.  It's so bad for me but too tasty for me to care."}
{"text":"We went here recently on an off hour of about 3 in the afternoon.  Waitress was top notch and professional.   Food was very good and came out quickly, fresh and hot.  Someone in the restaurant almost choked on a bite of food and the waitress and manager showed up right away and handled everything right for the poor fellow.  They brought a glass of water for him and made sure everything was ok.   They didn't overdo it but did just enough and handled the situation so professionally I was really impressed.  Nice to see a place so well run."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this restaurant.   In contrast to my recent visit to another restaurant on the square this place really met my expectations and then some.
The staff was very nice, there was plenty of seating with a lot of room between tables, the menu was simple and straightforward.  I ordered the Irish Stew which was delicious with perfect portions of mashed potatoes and bread.  The price was appropriate for an excellent meal.
I was a little disappointed that my waiter didn't ask me if I wanted more to drink because I did.  He put my bill on the table as if he was saying, \"time for you to leave\".  But this poor finish was not enough for me to lower my rating.
I look forward to going back with friends and/or family with hopes of having just a little bit better service."}
{"text":"I got the shepherd's pie and my friend got the bangers & mash. The shepherd's pie uses chuck roast I believe so it has nice chunks of beef. You get quite a bit of food for the price. The waitstaff was nice and they had a great selection of beer.

This location is a lot less busy than the one on the capitol square. So, if you don't want to wait, this is a good choice. The menus are a little different at the different locations."}
{"text":"Great Irish food. Had the Corned Beef and Cabbage, a great portion. Well flavored and perfectly prepared. Mashed potatoes were fluffy. Very good choice."}
{"text":"This was my first taste of the famous Wisconsin cheese curds and it definitely did not disappoint! I actually have hated cheese all my life, so I was super hesitant to try one, but omg they didn't have the aftertaste of cheese that I normally dread so much! 
Came on the night of the World Series (#flytheW) and there was pretty good crowd. I ordered the mussels (the quantity was huge!) and my group shared the cheese curds. I got good reviews from everyone at my table on their entrees (fish and chips, bangers and hash). Would have given 3 stars because my entree had a lot of empty mussels and the bread that came along with it was rather hard, but the cheese curds were really delicious so 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Super good food & great service. Highly recommend the smoked salmon blt! The Friday fish fry is also exceptionally good!"}
{"text":"Wow! I never expect much when it comes to a meal at a pub, since the focus is usually beer and other bevs. But this menu blew me away- their dishes are sophisticated and palate-pleasing! I got the \"Holla! Grilled Cheese\" made with buttery challah bread, cheese curds and seasoned tomato powder.... It was the best grilled cheese I've ever had, and the arugula side salad was fresh, crunchy, flavorful, and perfectly dressed. My dad got the shepherd's pie with lamb and it was beautifully presented, tasted delicious and wasn't too hearty/filling. Mom's chicken wings were pretty tasty, too, and our relatives' \"Hail Mary\" burgers looked insane. This place popped into my restaurant explorations unexpectedly (I had heard of it but never was eager to go) when some relatives suggested we go after a Badger game... The setting was very comfortable and the food was great. So glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"not positive it was worth the 4 stars i'm rating it, but it was my first night in madison so i'll be nice. 

cheese dip: out of pretzels so had pita bread. they were unapologetic which i didn't love. its why we chose to go there oddly! 

GF's salad seemed fine. i got beef stroganoff which was just really super rich pasta with some really tasty medium rare beef on top. i didn't expect the pasta to be so creamy, but it tasted great and the beef really was cooked perfectly. and for that.... 4 stars."}
{"text":"I seriously love the atmosphere here.  My favorite place to watch a hockey game.  The staff are great, the drinks are very tasty.  A nice selection of Irish whiskey (of course, you'd hope so!).
I feel extremely comfortable here, and fellow customers are always a good time, too.
There are many choices for sitting--bar, bar tables, sit-down tables, and a comfier part upstairs.  Bathrooms have been nice and clean every time I've been in.
I've never eaten here, but I'd like to try it soon."}
{"text":"The food gets 5 stars -- the server recommended the Shepherd's Pie and it was tasty. I had to take half of it home because it was such a large serving.My fiancee had the Pesto Chicken Wrap and it was good as well. 

The atmosphere also gets 5 stars-- a really neat looking interior that I imagine will be really cozy when it gets cooler outside.

The only reason I'm giving it a 4-star review is that 5 or 6 of the on-duty employees decided to congregate around a nearby table when an off-duty employee came in for a visit. I understand that business was winding down - but we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for 15 minutes while they all chatted it up. I'm really not that \"get off my lawn\" kind of angry customer - I'm young and spent many years working in restaurants. Just know the time and place, staffers -- and try not to make nearby customers feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I visited Brocach for the first time with some family that were visiting from out of town. I had been a little worried about going here, as there were some picky eaters in the bunch, but everyone really enjoyed their food. 
I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. When it came out, I was initially disappointed, as it looked like a small portion. Once I began eating, however, I realized how deep the dish was and how rich and filling the pie was. It was delicious! I loved the crispy chips on the top, which not only looked cool as a garnish, but also added a nice crunch. 
Others in my party ordered the fish fry, reuben, wild boar sloppy joe, and the pub burger. Everyone liked their food. I snagged some fries off someone's plate, and they were delicious as well. 
The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was that the restaurant was pretty loud, even though we were seated away from the bar. It shouldn't be a huge problem as long as you're not planning on having any intimate conversation while there."}
{"text":"Great place. I went here with a group of friend on a Friday night and it was packed. Good thing we had a reservation! We got to sit in this cozy table by the window that had these super long benches. Very nice.

The first thing we did was order some drinks. They have a good selection of Irish imports. I got the Magner's pear cider and the guys got Guinness and some other beers. They were served at just the right temperature (I know because I tried :P)

But the real kicker was the food. I got the Shepherd's Pie, which was awesome! The beef, pea, and carrot filling was so yummy and piping hot. I think it's interesting that they used chuck instead of ground beef, which gives the dish much more flavor. The mashed potatoes were nicely browned and tasty. What more could you ask for? 

Overall a very nice meal. I'd definitely be interested in coming again and also checking out their Gypsy swing nights...."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips, better than at a London pub! The fish Is excellent and perfectly prepared. Shephard's pie was amaziiiiing, the meat was very well done. Definitely coming back. 

PS brunch menu only available on Sunday's- but they do have a few brunch specials on other days."}
{"text":"Went to Brocach with the wife the day after Christmas. The space is nice and inviting and the gentleman who met us at the door was acting as host, bartender, busser, server, and who knows what else.

Didn't affect service in the least. Got the bangers and mash and found it to be great - a good lunch portion that didn't leave me feeling like I needed a food coma after and didn't leave me feeling like I'd overpaid.

Draught selection is just super, food is good, atmosphere is nice. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"I grew up in an Irish neighborhood in Chicago, and I went to a university with a very good Irish pub in walking distance of campus so maybe I am being harsh with this two star rating with high standards. Regardless, I know good Irish food when I have it, and Brocach does not deliver for me.

The beer list is about what I would expect from a Madison pub. Now that I am writing this review, I regret not getting a pint of Guinness. You can tell a lot about the quality of an Irish pub by their Guinness pour. I will return later with an update for everyone.

The decor is spot on and service seems to be attentive.

Something that worried me is that my food arrived in less than 5 minutes after ordering. Food has either been made in large batches or is being prepared with the use of a microwave.

I ordered both an order of cheese curds and an order of Shepherd's Pie, an Irish cuisine staple. The cheese curds were heavily breaded and came with something that resembled a tarter sauce. I was greatly disappointed by both the curds and the sauce it was served with. The breading was way too heavy to appreciate the cheese inside. Also why are you serving tarter with the cheese curds? This isn't a fish fry. I recommend putting an Irish spin on the dish. Make a Guinness or a whiskey sauce; do something creative.

The Shepherd's Pie was disappointing. Many of the vegetables in it were diced too large and the pieces were inconsistent. The cooks in the back need to work on their finesse with a knife. I bit into several pieces of carrot that were at least an inch in diameter and completely raw. The ground beef in the pie tasted like it was prepared to be part of a sloppy Joe, not a Shepherd's Pie. The taste of ketchup and bbq sauce was overpowering. Usually Shepherd's Pie will have beer or whiskey incorporated into the sauce. The potatoes on top were prepared well enough. My favorite part of the dish was the crunchy, fried potato slices on top.

I want to like Brocach because I love good Irish food, but I can't give it more than two stars because the Shepherd's pie was so far off the mark for me between the seasoning and raw vegetables."}
{"text":"Good Irish pub right across the street from the capital building. I went there with my friend to grab a quick lunch. I was not expecting much just because it look like more of a rundown Irish bar. I was happily surprised by the quality of food and service.
They were even okay with me making some substitutions which I always appreciate.
 The salad was small but fresh. My main dish was a steak and poached eggs. I was impressed a the dish was very good. The prices weren't too bad either.
I went on a Saturday afternoon and there was a good mix of young and old and everything in between. There were lots of families too.
I look forward to returning here in the future."}
{"text":"I had the newly updated pub burger and fries with a chef special curry sauce. The burger was very fresh and served on gluten free bread. I was really impressed with the fries which were still in their most raw potato form, and fried to perfection.  The curry sauce was an excellent complement to all of the food on the plate. Service was good as well. Overall, it was a superb dining experience."}
{"text":"Saturday and Sunday they ONLY serve brunch. If you come in be aware that the standard menu will NOT apply."}
{"text":"At first glance, this place is your typical Americanized-Irish pub. You know, the gaelic phrases on the wall, Guinness and Harp signs hanging on the wood-paneled walls, and a roaring fire. 

But upon closer inspection, this place is actually pretty cool. The bartenders are personable and remember repeat customers. The atmosphere is warm and inviting - the kind of place full of good people, good beer, and good times. 

So, stop by sometime, put your feet up, and enjoy a night out amongst friends."}
{"text":"Right on Capitol Square. Real nice Irish pub, the name means \"badger den\" in Gaelic. And if you don't know my now the significance of the BADGER in Madison, well then, I suggest your brush up on your history, or suffer the consequences at the next Wisconsin football game. 

Didn't go here, but I have coworkers who have, and raved about it. Wide selection of ales, single malt Scotch, and Irish whiskies. Here they have pretty good pub food, and no matter where you are on the Square, this is not far from you. Sits directly across from the capitol."}
{"text":"Been here several times, they did a really good job of getting the big city Irish pub thing right.  Great choice of the usual Irish beers and whiskeys and a few surprises.  If you are getting ready to go out for a night of drinking and need to fill up the stomach, nothing will do you better than their Bangers and Mash.  If you finish it, you have accomplished what many cannot, and you will have a satisfied smile on your face to boot."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty darned good for a \"pub\". I've had some great risotto and a darned good fish fry at Brocach...which are two things that don't normally come from ONE place. If I was a beer or whiskey drinker, I'd be a happy camper, for it looks like there's ample choices in both. It's actually nice decor, themed without being too campy. It does get pretty loud in the downstairs bar area, so I favor being upstairs. The view of the capitol from upstairs is breathtaking, anyhow. I'd sit at that window all night...if it weren't for fear of becoming \"that weird window-lady\". 

If anyone were to wander up to me on the street and ask \"Where's a good pseudo-Irish-pub, lassie?\" I'd point my finger in Brocach's direction."}
{"text":"Bad pretentious service. Over-priced, nasty food. Terrible experience every time I've been there"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst dining experiences I can remember in recent memory. Understaffed and really busy on a recent Friday night. Took 20 minutes for our drink order to come. The food all came out at different times. My wife had a grilled cheese that might be one of the saddest excuses for grilled cheese I have ever seen. She was able to easily pull apart both slices of bread from each other and that revealed one half slice of cheese on the entire sandwich. My fish tacos were incredibly overrun with jalapenos. I love spice but on one of my small tacos I counted 12 jalapeno slices, so that just completely overpowered all of the other flavors. 

Our waitress was very overburdened and extremely nice despite having to handle far too much on her own. She is the reason this is not a one star review. With all the great dining options on the Monroe stretch, we probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Its great.  The ambience is amazing just like the original Brocach.  The menu seems awesome as the other one.  We went for brunch and it was great.  We were greeted by the hostess & the manager.  Then the watiress had good service too.  Everyone enjoyed their food, the fried cheese sandwich looked the best, even though I didn't have it.  We had a good eggs benedict with ham, seasoned with rosemary.  Our only gripe was that the eggs were pretty runny, but hey they are new, and it was New Years so I kept 5 stars for having a great staff at 10 AM even after Madison New Years Celebrations."}
{"text":"love this place.  Relaxed and classy.  Best Guiness around.  They also have the best burger I have ever eaten.  Little spendy at over $10 but... Wow!"}
{"text":"This location holds a special place in my heart as it was here where I went on my first date with my girlfriend.  While that amazing memory will never fade away, I hope the meal and service I experienced last night quickly disappears.
After we were seated, a manager/owner/someone who definitely not the waitstaff, stopped over and asked if we wanted something to drink and if we had any questions about the menu.  When I asked what was the burger and soup of the day, he had to go back and find out.  He returned and told us incorrectly what the soup was (Lobster bisque which is already listed on the menu).  We learned later it was smoked tomato soup (when our actual waiter arrived).
Moving on from that, we opted for a couple salads and chicken and dumplings.  We were a little confused with the salads.  The greens were not dressed-rather, the dressing was at the bottom of the salad bowl.  It was somewhat awkward to try to mix the salad in the attempt to distribute the dressing.  I will give them credit as the salmon and chicken added to our salads (one each) were perfectly cooked and for the amount, a steal for the $5 upcharge. 
We ordered a cup of decaf coffee and bread pudding.  After a few minutes, the waiter came back and told us that he would need to brew a carafe of the decaf-almost hoping we would then,in turn, tell him not to. This wasn't the case and we patiently waited for our dessert and coffee.  A few minutes later and the coffee was brought to the table.  A few minutes after that, our waiter returned and asked if we wanted anything else for our dessert.  We reminded him that we ordered the bread pudding and he stated that he never heard that.  Oh well, the wait continued and finally the bread pudding arrived.  
The dessert was shared on a cedar plank (see picture I posted) and obviously the refrigerated dessert was warmed in the oven.  The result-A heated cedar plank with an ice cold (in some places lukewarm) bread pudding.  Why they put it on a cedar plank (giving off the smell of cedar) is beyond my comprehension.  Perhaps a savory bread pudding would benefit from the cedar but definitely not a sweet rendition like the one on the menu.  Even more confusing was the apple \"sticks\" sprinkled on top.  It seriously looked like someone ripped up a piece of barnwood and sprinkled hay on top.  We quickly sent it back and with the delay of our initial server and the coffee, promptly asked for our check.
I could see ourselves going back to reminiscence over our first date and having a cocktail.  Us, having a meal, probably better odds of the Cubs winning the world series."}
{"text":"With the recent remodel, gone are the days of a cozy irish pub.  While the dark walls remain, they have opened up the space and whitewashed the walls.  It's sleek and modern and while I enjoy it, the charm and uniqueness of it's former self is no longer.  We stopped in for a quick drink and appetizers on a Wednesday day to find the restaurant about half full with plenty of seats at the bar.  With Whiskey Den now part of their name (at least on their website), the pub has jumped on the bandwagon  for the popular brown liquor and feature many predominantly on the shelves behind the bar.  From a beer perspective, nothing to write home about.  Of course Guiness and Smithwicks with a smattering of craft beers but nothing that sets Brocach apart. We ordered cheese curds and wings alongside our beers as we were short on time and knew these can be prepared relatively quickly.  We were wrong as it took considerably longer than what we expected  The place wasn't packed so don't understand why the delay.  While the wings were solid, the cheese curds were disappointing.  They were your average Sysco curds, pre breaded and forgettable.  The curd game is strong on the square (I'm looking at you Heritage, Graze, Tipsy Cow,etc) and these didn't hold a candle to any of them.
I think Brocach might be in a tough spot.  Obviously what was unique and different about the pub wasn't resonating with their customer base, hence the remodel.  But now, while inviting, it's just another place downtown.  It's survival of the fittest and with new restaurants already there or being planned, how Brocach establishes their identity and executes on it will be critical."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The inside is absolutely gorgeous! The upstairs has couches I want to steal. The food is pretty damn good and the drinks are fantastic! The only draw back is the price. Some of the drinks can get pretty pricey and I don't feel like its worth it. Either way it's a great place to hang out with friends late at night. I probably won't seek the place out, but I'll definitely always be game any time some one else wants to go!"}
{"text":"To the people who sat by my significant other and I last night in Brocach,

I apologize. You see, we were both starving. I'd just gotten done taking the LSAT and he was--well, visiting his old fraternity. Both of us just wanted good food close to our hotel.

And when we got our food (I, the Brocach Burger and a Pinot Noir, and he, the corned beef and cabbage with Cap Brewery's Oktoberfest) and had it, well, I imagine the moaning sounds were probably off-putting.

I apologize for our dramatics over how good it was, but it really was worthy of all that indulgent noise.

If I may make it up to you by suggestion, try the Brocach Buger. You'll come to understand why."}
{"text":"This review is for the newly remodeled Brocach. First, the good stuff: the new design is gorgeous inside and out.

The not so good stuff: the menu leans more to the unhealthy side and the items I tried didn't rock my world. Even the salad options are unhealthy. For example, the white fish Caesar salad is more chip than salad (and so salty it borders on being inedible, as my friend and I agreed). The salmon with capers is almost like eating an entire jar of super salty capers. Beyond that the fare seems more America than I remember.

Finally: where's the soccer!? All tvs were set to ESPN and American football. Brocach used to be the place to go to get outside of the American sports bubble and really added to the culture. I hope they bring that back.

Looking forward to upping my stars and I'll surely be back, this place has always had a piece of my heart."}
{"text":"BURGERS. Burgersburgersburgers. Eat them here. Especially the Dublin City. I don't like Guinness at ALL, but I loved the Guinness Stout sauce on that burger. Everything on it was cooked perfectly (fried onions, bacon, the burger itself, and there were no green vegetables involved--but sometimes it's just good to have an honestly unhealthy burger, you know? I also tried a bite (or two...or five) of my friend's roasted beet salad, which was SO delicious. I love a good goat cheese/fruit salad, and this one was awesome. The pickle that came with my burger tasted more like a cucumber than a pickle, but other than that, the food was amazing.

Service was great too. Our server was friendly, quick, efficient, and got all our orders right with no problems. I was also really impressed with the host staff--we came in at about 8 on a Friday night with a group of five, told them we were expecting to have seven of us, and they seated us right away at the couch-booth-table-thing! So great."}
{"text":"We came here when our plans for sushi were foiled. Our three kids were cranky and hungry. The server was excellent--brought fries right away, then coloring pages at just the right times (we're from out of town and HAD to eat out, thus the cranky kids made us stuck between a rock and a hard place) to cheer everyone up. The shepherd's pie, pork cutlet and mussels were all great, and the drink selection was nice. The above and beyond level of service helping us get the kids taken care of so all five of us could truly enjoy and not simply survive the meal would make me recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I have spent a few afternoons just chilling out at Brocach with friends. The atmosphere is just so cozy at both the bar and dining area. The servers and bartenders are very attentive and fun.
They have a great selection of beer and I absolutely LOVE the food!!!!

The duck fat fries are ridiculous... I don't know why that appetizer exists, but I am so glad it does. YUM!!!! Brocach also has delicious wings with very unique and tasty sauce options. The Guiness stout sauce is probably my favorite.

I usually order the baked Mac and Cheese for dinner because it's incredible. I should probably venture out and get something else one of these days... But I just love that dish too much. My husband likes the burgers a lot and everyone I have ever dined with here enjoyed their meals immensely. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a meme restaurant. Just look at some of the pictures. Deconstructed bread pudding on a shingle from Home Depot? How the hell are you supposed to eat that burger? Putting chex mix and banana chips on french toast? Someone in the BoH is trying too hard. Just fuck my shit up fam 

Decent fish and chips. The Irish breakfast isn't really the big screaming deal people make it out to be. You're not getting gouged here either for the most part. I like the fact that they have some snacks for 2 bucks even if they are small. lots of seating, decent beer. I'm not going back anytime soon but if I lived around there I might"}
{"text":"very bland food.. The fish and chips is a joke.  It's in a prime location, right next to the capital building of Madison, WI but look elsewhere for a great evening in Madison."}
{"text":"Service is literally amazing. The host/waiter chatted with me when I came in and when I said I was in hurry he showed me the menu and explained specials before I even sat down. Promised 15min cook time and it was true. I ordered the Monroe burger which is like classic cheese burger but with juicy perfectly seasoned beef and wi cheddar with house aioli and arugula. It was definitely the best burger I've had in madison. Came with a side of greens which had a vinaigrette dressing that blew me away. Raspberry maybe? I also ordered he stone ground ipa which was great. I'm an iPa double ipa type of person, the more hops the better and lemme tell ya, it was very good. Full body and grassy flavor, no bitter aftertaste. I highly recommend it. I liked it so much actually I got a flight after which was the Wednesday special of 4 5oz beers for 6$. I got the magic hat art hop, which was interesting but darker than you expect(as with all magic hat), descheutes was a solid amber ale but a little boring. The door county lil sister is weird but if you're looking to branch out it is very good but you have to be ready for the coriander because it HITS you. The mosaic hops was also very interesting with blood orange and sage. I definitely recommend beers here for both standard high quality drinks and novelty madison styles. I liked the beer so much actually I ordered more food in order to keep drinking. I got the bluegill tacos which are very meaty - which is good since they're 12$ and you want your money's worth. Fresh Mendota blue gill with pickled coleslaw and lime, cooked very tender and once again, spiced amazingly. I hear the Monroe st fair is this Saturday and that their special is novelty popcorn (I might have to check it out). Madison in general is a foodie city so it's hard to go wrong when picking restaurants, but if you're looking for a less crowded, tavern meal with a little extra fance, brocach is where it's at."}
{"text":"When I think of Irish food I think of bangers and mash, corned beef and all sorts of okay-tasting, stick to your bones fare. Brocach's delivered that home style goodness but had some great flavor too!

I tried the potato and leek cream soup to start and it was very simple but good. There are no extra vegetables and the soup itself is on the thin side for a potato base, which I thought was just right  with some crackers. There's nothing Irish about their cheese curds, but they are classic Wisconsin delicious. Get them. For dinner I had the Salmon with sriracha maple glaze and for $12 this was a steal. Yum. The plate came out more like a salad than I was expecting, but honestly the greens were great. I also got to sneak a few bites of the corned beef my sister ordered and it was very hearty but so good. And as a bonus the corned beef doesn't have gluten because her stomach gets upset at that, it's always nice to have options for everyone!

If I lived in Wisconsin I would definitely come here somewhat regularly, it's got good food, a fun vibe and Guinness-Cider mixers, what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've always had an great experience at Brocach, be it stopping in for drinks, grabbing a meal, meeting for a book club, or throwing a private event.

I've had four private parties now at Brocach and they've all gone off more or less without a hitch. Both rooms upstairs are available for private parties for the amazingly low, low price of zero dollars. They are extremely flexible in terms of catering - you can choose to buy party trays and/or drinks, or let everyone just order for themselves and pay for their own tabs. 

Over the years we've had everything from DIY photo booths to karaoke and the staff has always taken everything in stride. The biggest issue was the WiFi failing last year (the photo booth had a wireless printer), but a friend was able to grab a cable from home to directly connect things. 

Special shout-out to current manager Marcos - he was especially attentive in planning my most recent event and helped make for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is a delicious cure for a hangover.  A group of 8 of us came here for breakfast on New Year's day and all of us left stuffed and satisfied.  We came a little after noon and they were out of biscuits, but since 5 of us had planned on ordering them, the cook said he'd make us some more.  Well worth the wait... they were fluffy clouds of excellence.  I had mushroom gravy with mine and it came with 2 eggs (your choice) and a mountain of potatoes.  My husband had the Brunch Poutine with fries covered in cheese curds, eggs, corned beef and hollandaise sauce.  He said it was fantastic.  We had bacon, sausage, and a fruit plate while we were waiting for the biscuits to be made and all were good. The fruit plate came with granola that was super tasty.  I had a mimosa that was pretty good, but in hindsight I probably should have avoided because it tasted a little too much like the night before.They had a special buy one get one free bloody mary and they were definitely the better choice.  They were garnished with a pearl onion, mushroom, olive, and a pickle spear.  Our waitress was amazing, and the hostess and manager (?) were super accommodating. They made us up a table and put us right in front of the fireplace."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, wonderful service, and OH MY GOD, their bangers and mash will blow your mind!

They are very well staffed, and table waits are never very long. And although the food menu is not terribly extensive it is full of authentic, delicious Irish food. And if you want a big menu to look at, they have an insane variety of whiskeys, all of which the servers and bartenders are very knowledgable on.

Easily the most underrated restaurant on the square. Most definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Delicious wisco fries (chili, cheese curds, and spinach)and pretzel breadsticks. You also should try the scotch egg, which is a hard-boiled egg in wrapped with sausage, which is then breaded and fried.  It sounds scary but is actually pretty good.  Bar service is great and they have fantastic late night drinks specials.  $5 glasses of wine and stoli doli martini."}
{"text":"You have to love this place weather just stopping for some drinks or coming for food and dinner. We enjoyed our meal and also several cocktails through the evening. The bar is cozy and slightly dim lighting wise but overall the atmosphere adds to the experience."}
{"text":"This was a great spot to meet for dinner!  We had reservations and had a cozy booth in the back!

We enjoyed a delicious basket of cheese curds and cold beer while we waited for our entrees.  

The Bangers & Mash were exactly as expected, my daughter loved the Beef Pastry Puff and my husband loved his burger.

The cheesecake was a delicious ending to our dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"Ok, here for an event and nothing was open. We were parked right in front of the Brocach on Main.   Checked out the menu, it sounded good.  Went in, placed an order for two salads.  One Chicken Ceasar and one Southwest with a crabcake.

So, the Ceasar....incredibly disappointing.  Bland.  Runny dressing that didn't taste like Ceasar.  Iceberg lettuce only.  No romaine or anything.  They even forgot the cheese on it.  The chicken was actually tasty but very small in portion considering they charge an extra 4.00 for it.   So 12.00 for a very boring salad and an extra 1.00 for an extra side of dressing.

Pathetic.  

The southwest salad, the guy who had it said basically the same thing.  Very bland and boring.  

The crabcake, pretty good was the answer.

All in all, way over priced and bland.  To somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in out of the rain on a Wednesday night on my way to local recommended, Graze.  Wish I had brought an umbrella.  Don't get me wrong.  I like irish pubs and this one is not bad.  The Brocach's beer was good and the irish whiskey collection tempting.  The brats that I ordered were also good, though if I was to do it again or offer any recommendation it would be to ask for the apples and sauce to be on the side as it overwhelmed the other flavors.  Just the same for $13, I can forgive quite a bit.  Then again, I would have been happy to pay more should it have inspired the wait staff to be more welcoming.  College hang out + college age wait staff = college age disinterest in \"customers\" or \"trying to do a good job\"."}
{"text":"This place is in desperate need of new cooks. Go somewhere else for food and come here later for several beers....even then, their beer selection is below sub par for a pub in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now.  This place is great!  It has an Irish theme and is perfectly located downtown by a lot of other great bars and restauarants.  The bar here is really good.   The man likes the their options of Irish beers and I really like the pineapple infused vodka that they keep atop the bar.

This place can get pretty busy.  I don't think I have been here when it hasn't been packed.  Witht that said however, the service is always great!  The bartenders and the servers are very polite.

I was here once on St. Patty's Day and of course there was a bit of a wait.  The wait was not that bad because they had a band playing.  When we finally got seated our server was very prompt and pleasant.  We ordered and were surpised by how quickly our food came.  They seemed to be very prepared for the rush of customers that they would receive on that day.  The food was good, no major complaints though I would have liked a bit more heat.  

All in all, I would certainly come to this location again.  It is a great place to grab a drink or to have dinner."}
{"text":"Brocach is great for dinner, private events, or a weekend night out. There are two bars (one upstairs and one downstairs) and the place is big, so it is easy to find a table even on weekend nights. The \"Stoli dolis\" (vodka that has been soaked in pineapple!) are on special late at night and are AMAZING but beware they are way stronger than you would think. I have been to a few private events in their upstairs area and the space is great for about 25 people. The food is traditional irish fare (not my favorite type of food but they do a nice job) and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I've never been to Ireland or to an Irish family's place for dinner, so I don't know exactly what \"real\" Irish food is supposed to taste like. I ordered the fish and chips, which were solid. The fried fish had a crispy outer layer with flaky cod on the inside. The fries were pretty standard. I feel like they fried both the fish and the fries in lard or put some sort of seasoning on it because it tasted meatier than normal. 

Lots of seating and a short wait on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place for brunch a few times, which the first time I was there was amazing because they had a wild rice omelet. However they have since changed the menu and it's not necessarily for the better. 

Was there for trivia Thursday with a slightly larger group and the service was very slow. I don't think it was our waitresses fault because she was new and still learning what was all available. However when four of us ordered food, three dishes came out after a wait and the fourth which was a salad came out 15 minutes after the first dishes. It also took 30+ minutes to get our drinks. And then we didn't end up getting 2 of them because they were out of the ingredients. 

As for the food, the quinoa & greens power bowl had great ingredients, but way too much dressing on it. On the other hand the garlic parmesan fries were well seasoned.

I'll probably be back for brunch when there are less people, but I don't know about for dinner."}
{"text":"I should've read the past reviews here before going, which give the correct impression that the burgers are the least appetizing items on the menu.  Well, I ignorantly ordered a burger...it was decidedly mediocre.  The pub fries were ok, but served without salt (I salted them myself, but shouldn't fries be salted?).  The bottle of scotch ale I ordered was decent, though served way too cold.  Oddly, it was presented to me with an 8 oz. Pilsner/Weisen style glass.  Even a tumbler would've been far more appropriate.  There are only about a half dozen British beers on offer here, which is kind of slim for an Irish pub, I think.  Not real impressed overall."}
{"text":"Top rating for one reason only:

Wednesday nights + incredible musicians gathered around an upstairs table playing Irish music + two Dark and Stormy cocktails = a stellar way to end your Hump Day."}
{"text":"Brocach Monroe, I'm smitten! 

The ambiance is might brighter than the Capitol Square location but maintains the cozy booths and wooden accents. The menu has some nice vegan/vegetarian options-- chilled green gazpacho, golden beet salad, vegetarian shepherd's pie, and a walnut burger! I got the Muffaletta (marinated vegetables, olives, artichoke hearts and tuscan hummus on ciabatta) - YUM. Apparently this is a specialty in New Orleans? Delicious combination of flavors. 

I love that the menu incorporates Irish classics with rock solid other options (hey, some of us just aren't bangers and mash folks). Even if you've been to the downtown location it's worth a jaunt to the west side, laddies!"}
{"text":"Nice irish pub in Madison. Had Shepard Pie. Fair. Service was fast. 

Great place for sharing time with friends."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, wasn't too packed that it was hard to move around or find a seat. Just the right amount of people! Didn't come for food, just some good ol'fashioned drinking which I found to be quite expensive. Typical stocked bar and nothing extra special on tap, unless your totally in love with Irish beers.

In my opinion this place isn't anything special, especially being located on the square. Better off just bypassing."}
{"text":"This is a small plates place with an astounding view. I attended a business reception here and the staff were very good. We were able to use the more lounge space which was great and comfy for chatting. And the views. 

Food-ok I'm mostly vegan but will eat vegetarian when traveling. The breads with various toppings were good. The veggie pizza was excellent. No cheese, hummus and tasty and flavorful crust. Thigh veggie options were limited, still was nicely done. Reasonable cost. It's the ambiance that rates it with a forth star."}
{"text":"A case of incredibly bad service doomed our brunch at Brocach this morning. Nearly 40 minutes before our order was taken, and that's just the beginning. Had to ask multiple times for water, coffee was always, \"still brewing\", and everything just seemed to take extra long. Once the food was ready, they literally brought out two plates of food each trip to the table.  Maybe they should invest in some serving trays. 

Here's the odd part of the whole service issue, there were only 3 or 4 tables seated in the whole restaurant. Who knows. 

The food in general was fine. Our table of 4 adults and 2 kids had a variety, including the chocolate chip pancakes, a veggie omelet, the Irish breakfast, and I had the corned beef hash. The dry toast wasn't bad after we asked for jam. The hash, was really just corned beef chunks mixed with diced potato. Pretty simple mix it together prep, but still tasted good. 

Overall, I'll be in no hurry to return. Too many great restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Had the bangers and mash, which were stunningly delicious. The crispy outside of the sausages contrasted beautifully with the smooth potatoes. The apple shallot sauce and the crispy kale brought it all together amazingly. And, oh, I know it's trendy, but I could have scarfed a bunch more of that kale. A great way to add veggies to a traditionally starch heavy dish. 

Our waitress was friendly and helpful, making useful recommendations and there when we needed her. We went on a Saturday morning, so no crowds. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night and while place was empty, they sat us in booth towards the back next to the service bar and near the restrooms...sat for 10 minutes for a drink order, mind you the manager was sitting at the bar with her back to us just talking to bartender. Finally, the waiter gets there and we give him the full order (drinks+meals). Drinks and food came promptly...the Ruben was very tasty.  Overall food quality is good, however service was seriously lacking! Staff including manager should be more aware their guest!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff are fantastic, however their food is lacking. When Brocach first opened they had an excellent selection of meals. Their Irish Breakfast is no longer available. It was one of the better breakfast meals in the city. Their bangers and mash were delicious as well using proper bangers. They no longer use bangers, and instead just use some flavorless sausage. Bangers have a very specific flavor, and you cannot simply substitute them with anything else. Kind of a shame because I loved this place because of the proper UK food and flavors, and it now serves typical food you can get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a delightful Sunday morning. We elected outdoor seating to enjoy the weather despite the cramped space.  Drink and food orders were taken quickly. Everything else moved at a snails pace. The food, after it finally arrived, was the saving grace on this outing.  I would give the corned beef hash 3.5/5. Nothing outlandishly spectacular.  On the other hand, I am giving the donuts all of the stars. I could easily see myself going back for two orders and a coffee.

Looking back at our experience, I would have to heed the words of a passerby while we were eating.  \"So this will be our choice 'B'.\" 

A solid \"B\" at that."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying... We went on the best night on the best day with the best weather. This place was awesome. Live irish music on fridays, phenomenal bangers and mash! The shepherds pie was pretty good. The sweet chili shrimp was yummy, but just as expensive as my entree, so I didn't think it was worth it. 

Overall, apps are way over priced, but the beer, irish dishes and atmosphere totally made the place. I drank a delicious snakebite. But the bangers and mash had this apple saute on top that blew my mind. GET THEM."}
{"text":"We miss the old Brocach. The new interior is sterile and nothing like an Irish pub - it looks like any other generic hipster restaurant now. The new menu is meh. My husband had the beef pot pie - for $14 the serving was small and there wasn't a ton of beef in there. I had just a side of Mac n cheese because nothing was sounding terribly appetizing. The mac n cheese was tasty, and for $4 I got a good size portion. My friend got the bangers and mash - she was disappointed they had changed the recipe because it used to be one of her favorite dishes. 

Overall, the service was great. The food was okay, the drink menu was small and the decor was disappointing. If this was my first time here, I'd probably give it a better rating. But knowing what it used to be, I can't give it more than a 2. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and dinner many times and love the food! 

A lot of the good restaurants on the square have crazy waits for brunch, yet for some reason it seems like people don't know about Brocach. Take advantage of this and eat their delicious food without waiting! There's traditional Irish fare as well as the typical stuff. I've really enjoyed the bangers and mash, Ruben breakfast burrito and the biscuit and sausage gravy.


This is also a fun bar. Good drinks and friendly bartenders. I like the tavern decor, kind of feels like you're in a home or an old school inn."}
{"text":"Came here for fun and was not disappointed. Sam was excellent and the service was amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great Irish Pub experience!!!"}
{"text":"Has anyone ever been to an irish bar that didn't seem priced beyond what it should be?  What is it about \"irish bistro\" that warrants doubling prices?    I mean, its meat, potatoes, and cabbage....seemingly always for $12 and up, washed down with a $6 and up beer.  I'm not even too sure there is a defining \"irish\" thing about the the irish bars except for a little more woodworking and high prices.

Disclaimer: I rarely like irish bars, in case you couldn't tell from the above.

Disclaimer aside, brocach is actually one of the better \"irish bistros.\"  Food is decent, but not worth what it'll cost you.  Has a decent irish beer selection, but it's probably also not worth what it'll cost you.  Especially when you can get the same beers elsewhere for less.

Nothing has really stood out to me that I've eaten."}
{"text":"Was shocked when I walked into this place after it being a few years. They had renovated the place, changed the menu and the beer selection (they have a \"take over\" of other breweries for limited events and they had no porter/dark beer selection besides the typical Guinness on tap), and also the recipes to some of their traditional dishes (fish and chips is what I had.) Was disappointed to not see the old booths, snug corners for great people watching on the Square, and the loss of great food.  The fish and chips came out smaller, oiler, less breaded (I was ok with that), but the fries were soggy with oil.  Place was very empty for a Friday afternoon; it usually is teeming with people coming off from working the capital and college kids but this is summer.  Sadly I don't think I will return to one of my favorite places. Service was good and attentive, music wasn't too loud and played 90s rock alternative, and there was some people to watch but it's not enough for me to want to return.  Cooper's Tavern is where I'm heading for my Irish food kick on the Capital Square."}
{"text":"A fun place to hang out, especially when the bars further down State Street are crawling with students.  Good beer selection and pretty decent food.  Oh, and Brocach has the most amazing black bean burger I've ever tasted.  Seriously.  I don't care if you're normally a carnivore, order the black bean burger and cherish every bite."}
{"text":"Just an ok experience

It was a frigid Saturday in November, noonish, so we came in and ordered hot toddies. After a bit of a wait they only brought 1. Rather than order another we split it. Ordered bloody marys spiked with Guinness and a beer back. We got both this time but they weren't anything special. They may deserve a higher rank on a normal day but our visit fell on 2.5 stars unfortunately."}
{"text":"This would have been a 3 or 4 star rating but the 25+ minutes we were there after we were done eating just waiting to pay was too annoying. I could have dealt with it if we were finishing up drinks or something but we were just sitting there and waiting and waiting and waiting. The service when we first got there was pretty quick but it soon took a dive. 

Husband and I each had a bourbon old fashioned. It was tasty but there were chunks of sugar not dissolved that kept plugging the straws. Good to know it's made properly though. Had a decent beer selection, nothing extraordinary. 

I had the fish and chips which were really good. The tartar sauce was yummy. I would have liked fewer chips and maybe one more piece of fish. Husband had the bangers and mash and he said it was good. The menu is pretty minimal but a good variety of items. 

Overall, I don't think we would go again for a meal. Maybe would stop for a drink, but not likely with so many better options in the area.

Update: I was on the fence about giving a 2 or 3 star rating. After I gave it a 2, I was contacted by a gentleman from Brocach asking questions about my review and he said service is something they've acknowledged as being something they need to improve. I'm upgrading this review from a 2 to a 3 and I would be willing to try it again in a few months to see if there has been improvement. Thanks for reaching out and I'm glad to hear you are working on improving. Maybe we'll stop in again."}
{"text":"This is big step above regular bar food. There are many healthy options on the menu. I have enjoyed the shepherds pie, the salads, soups and the chicken dumplings.  The selection of beers is diverse and the choices they have made for their offers excellent."}
{"text":"As with many folks, we found the food good.  It is the service that is slow.  I had the wild mushroom shepherd's pie.  Very hearty meal with a great flavor."}
{"text":"Very cool Irish Pub atmosphere.  In fact, probably one of the best irish pubs in Madison.  I've been here for lunch and occasional happy hour after work and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Old Fashion was the non-dive go to bar of 08. For 09, I'm choosing Brocach. 

Tuesday night in January was empty, but the emptiness has its nice side. I got to explore everywhere in the bar without hesitation. This place is beautifully constructed. Love the sofas, and booth throughout the bar. Nice. I can appreciate the grown-up sophistication while sipping on French 75.

Ladies, if you have to go to the rest room, go to the 1st floor's. The upstairs' door doesn't clothes completely. Unless you are a fervent fan of 1920 deco, I'll stick to the pretty, auto-flushed down stairs one.  

I want to try the food next time with a pint of Guiness."}
{"text":"WORST BRUNCH IN MADISON!!!!! See my picture!

Seriously disappointing brunch, I got the breakfast sandwich and it was a complete disgrace to food and restaurants around the downtown area. 

The sandwich itself was comical, my friends and I could not stop laughing at how seriously sad it looked. Rather than cheddar cheese as the menu lists, it contained a few unmelted slices of kraft American singles....I seriously urge you to check the picture I uploaded to see this monstrosity.  The bacon was anemic looking and slightly undercooked and the bread was a joke, it looked and felt like it was microwaved - untoasted completely but slightly warm. The menu also listed a Dijon mayo for the sandwich which was no where to be found. The egg was ok I guess? It honestly felt like a cook ran out of cheese and decided hitting up Walgreens for a pack of kraft singles was a good idea. 

One of my group members got the French Toast and it was just two small slices of a baguette. Not thick cuts or anything, we thought it may have been a joke when we saw the two small pieces of bread, but alas it was reality. Not only was there an abysmally minuscule amount of French toast, it was bland and lacking flavor.

My friend asked if we could speak to a manager but apparently they were busy on a call. They ended up comping her orange juice...again it made no sense but at least it was comical.

I eat out around Madison 4-5 times a week and this is the first time I have just been completely shocked by food lacking in quality. I seriously urge you to save your money or try any other place, heck even the subway next door is better."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and reasonable variety of menu.  I dream about their beet salad - SO good!"}
{"text":"Well decorated Irish Pub.  Looks like a great place to have a beer or whiskey, but I was a little let down with my meal.

I ordered a bowl of potato leek soup and a classic Reuben w/fries.  The soup was a major let down.  Very watery, with no potato flavor.  Not only was the soup plain, it came out right before on sandwich.  Like one spoonful of soup, and bang... Here's your sandwich.  

Two other things surprised me, no salt/pepper on the tables, and that they do not have any thousand island dressing.  No dressing available for a Reuben?  

As far as my sandwich, I would say that that was very good.  Would have been excellent with a little 1000 Island!  Fries were good too."}
{"text":"We started on the square at the Old Fashioned. There was an hour wait there for 5 people. We were hungry and it was hot out, so we ventured over to Brocach to see if there was a wait for a table. No wait and they had AC- so that was a bonus for us! They get 2 stars for the AC. The food took forever and it wasn't very good. The fish fry was disgusting. the batter on the fish was soggy and FULL of oil. YUCK! My fries were so charred that they almost disintegrated as I chewed them. I had the worst stomach ache (almost instantly) from the food. I had to put my best face on since we were hosting a guest to dinner. We had ordered cheese curds for a starter and no one wanted to eat more than one. Cheese curds people! You HAVE to get these right in Wisconsin! If there are any left on the plate, this is a very bad sign. I don't think I have ever heard of that happening. 
."}
{"text":"I came for the Guinness on tap. And while here, learned about the \"peatiness\" of Scotch and had some very edifying conversations with customers who come here for their depth of brew as well as their knowledge. A great place to enjoy a Guinness and a shot of your favorite spirit: classy, without the bullshit attitude!"}
{"text":"I had another patron physically assault me while I was dancing with the Slainte dancers on St. Patrick's Day and the front of house team immediately informed the Manager after I spoke with them and the individual was removed. I thoroughly appreciate the team's actions to make other patrons feel comfortable and safe in their establishment. I will lost definitely return."}
{"text":"I met a couple folks here after dinner to watch a game. Although the crowd is much older than what I'm used to at the other establishments around the capitol, it was a nice reprieve from the college bar scene.

I wasn't in the mood for a beer, but they did have a delicious pineapple infused vodka sitting in a water dispenser on the bar that caught my eye. Get it on the rocks or in a martini, either way, there is more than enough pineapple juice to cut the taste of vodka. Dangerous."}
{"text":"Brocach has earned the extra star mostly due to ALWAYS fantastic service, excellent drinks, and the perfect setting for my department's Christmas party.  The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Madison last week and my daughter and I went out to dinner.  Downtown Madison is busy on a Saturday night and it's difficult to get into a decent restaurant without a wait.  We decided to try this restaurant because it wasn't overly busy.  I visited Ireland for two weeks last summer and have a pretty fair idea of what a good pub is like.  I don't know whether this one was or not because we were seated in what I can only describe as a cubbyhole.  Walls on three sides.  My daughter's view was me and the wall behind me.  My view was of people going to and from the restrooms right around the corner.  Our appetizer was brought to us with our entrees.  I don't know how any restaurant in Wisconsin could mess up cheese curds but Brocach managed it.  They tasted like they were frozen then deep-fried.  The Shepherd's Pie I had was....adequate.  Nothing special.  The only highlight was the dessert of Blueberry Bread Pudding with ice cream that was a very generous portion and tasty.  This is not a place I will revisit."}
{"text":"I went to Brocach with a friend for lunch on a Thursday afternoon, and it was great! The atmosphere was inviting and warm, and created an idea of what the style of the restaurant was like immediately. The restaurant wasn't crowded, so we sat down right away, and our waiter was friendly and prompt. We both loved our wraps and sandwiches, I will definitely head back!"}
{"text":"Great place any time, but especially for happy hour. Burger or pork sliders are fabulous and adding 12 wings is the topper. The drink specials are great and are a super time to try higher end whiskey or Scotch, not to mention a good old Murphy's stout."}
{"text":"Over priced food/drinks and we were seated at a table that was literally in the hallway to the restrooms when there were other open tables. Not again."}
{"text":"This place can only get away with their slow service and lackluster menu because of the location. 

When we visited in May, we were quickly seated and brought drinks. Then, the waiter never came back to take our order... Until an hour later. By that time, the two menu items we really wanted had run \"out\" (how do you run out of bangers and mash? I thought the dish originated from scarcity?). So, we ordered a lobster roll with a side of Mac n cheese.

But it gets worse. After two hours waiting for our food, it arrived. But, the chef got our order completely wrong. We got a side of fries instead of Mac n cheese. After all that trouble and wait we were hoping to at least get what we were promised. The waiter was kind and empathetic. He checked, but the kitchen refused to make us Mac n cheese. So much for customer service.

Then, we were promised that the kitchen would give us our sinner \"on the house\". Okay, great - a silver lining in this mess. Well, unfortunately when the check came, nothing was comped except the Mac and cheese which DID NOT EVEN COME to our table. So, we ended up not having to pay for food we never ate, but paid full price for everything else. We left with a very unhappy crew. 

Horrible experience, horrible dining service, pathetic menu."}
{"text":"Casual Irish pub. Creative seating options ( booths, a snug, bar, communal and individual tables). We were there on trivia night which was fun. Food choices were good and solid. Delicious salads. Several vegetarian and gluten free options. Friendly waitstaff. Daily specials. Tons of beers. Worth a visit when you are here to shop or go to a Badger game."}
{"text":"Not friendly.  It was not busy yet the service was extremely slow.  Our group group did not feel welcome."}
{"text":"Love the live Irish music and the apps are great. Lots of food for the price. Just wish they added Killian's to the beer list."}
{"text":"The family and I decided on a quick trip to Madison to check out the Capitol building and the Children's Museum. We wanted to grab a bite and decided on Brocach.  We were delighted to see it wasn't crowded as we have a daughter on the Autism spectrum and is adverse to extremely loud places.  We figured that the timing may have had something to do with is since we got there about 2pm.

The service was ok. Our waitress was really friendly but didn't really understand the menu it seemed. When I asked how many sausages you get as a side, she didn't know. When we asked about the fruit, she said you get strawberries but they didn't have any. I can see some of these being honest mistakes but I would also expect the wait staff to have a good handle on the menu.

The food was not anything we would go back for. My wife said the blood sausage was disgusting and the banger I had was weird... maybe that's just the style? She felt a little ill after eating as well... we won't blame it on the food but...

The highlight of the day was probably the pint of Guinness my wife had. 

We would not be coming back here and cannot recommend anyone else go either. There are a ton of restaurants in the area and hopefully what we experienced was the norm for the restaurants near the Capitol."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere in a neighborhood with a lot going on!  I've eaten here several times and the food is solid, the staff great, and the manager is wonderful. I had the Ruben sandwich on my last visit and it was so chewy I had to send it back which is rare for me. They let me order something new and promptly got it to the table and gave me half off the mushroom Swiss burger I ordered (super yummy btw-the bun was especially amazing) since my first choice was sub-par. I realized today I had forgotten my check card and when I called they were quick to check for me and had it waiting when I picked it up. I couldn't ask for more and I will definitely be back to enjoy the atmosphere with my friends and the live Irish style music!"}
{"text":"\"Garbage baked into my daughter's Sheppard Pie\"  

My daughters and husband had lunch at the Monroe Street location for a birthday celebration. After eating half of her Sheppard Pie, my daughter noticed a plastic cup (with ketchup in it) INSIDE her dish- as in cooked into it. Yes, I'm gagging as I wrote that. When she told the waiter he was shocked about it and made her a new one, to go --as everyone was done eating by then. The \"to go\" version was also odd- extra mushy and missing ingredients?? (Of course my daughter had totally lost her appetite anyway). I followed up with several calls asking for a refund for a horrible dining experience and spoke with three people who said I needed to talk to the manager. I was called back one time- rude , short message and that's it, no number left. I tried to call back again several times, no answer--then one more curt message left for me but clearly no attempt to address the situation so- just letting the world know there was GARBAGE BAKED INTO MY DAUGHTERS SHEPPARD PIE and all we asked for was a refund- nope didn't even get decent customer service after such an unacceptable mistake."}
{"text":"I walked in and heard Joy Division playing on the radio. To hear my theme music made me instantly love this place. Great food and ambiance.
Decent beer selection and delicious brunch selections.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere reminiscent of an Irish Tavern with traditional Irish food nicely presented in good size portions at a moderate price"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here friday night... it was alright. The atmosphere was pretty lively, with lots of dressed-up young ladies, gangs of dudes, bachelorette parties, and the like. Husband and I got two salmon dishes - BBQ salmon salad and a grilled salmon entree. Sad to say, we should have ordered two salads - it was about $5 cheaper and far more satisfying. I have a problem with dishes that don't warrant their price, and I definitely felt the salmon entree suffered from this condition. The sweet potatoes were fine, not noticeably sage-roasted, and the apple slaw was minimal and without dressing. The salmon salad was bountiful with a surprisingly spicy vinaigrette. The service was mostly inattentive. My noble rogue cocktail was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"The ambiance is Ireland-touristy rather than authentic Irish pub, if you've been lured into Bunratty Castle soon after landing in Shannon Airport, you know what I mean.  We came here after being discouraged by the disorganized looking long wait at a very nearby highly rated breakfast place one Sunday morning after checking out of the Madison Concourse.  This place had no wait (Sunday morning at 11) which raised suspicions, but I had high hopes for Irish breakfast.  Then I saw that they have poutine!  If you've never had poutine, it's a Canadian way of getting high cholesterol and dying early.  I wouldn't even know what poutine is if it weren't for Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto's antics, but now that I do know, I prefer my poutine without cocaine.  Here, they serve it with their Hollandaise sauce, which isn't quite right, ask to substitute their brown mushroom gravy instead, and that is the best way to undo any healthy diet you may be trying.  The Chief of Staff tried their biscuits and gravy which was okay, I think the way to go here is poutine plus Guinness on draught (is there really any other way?).  Service was good, really much better than what we saw around the corner at the top rated brunch place, next weekend morning we're in Madison, we're coming back here."}
{"text":"Since remodel, I would not recommend. I specifically made a stop here while in town for my birthday for my all time favorite drink, the stoli doli, only to be informed that they were no longer going to be serving them. I used to love coming to this place - it had a great vibe, now it just feels sterile - with no stoli dolis to boot! Anything that was special about this bar was completely stripped away. Now it's just like any other white washed sports bar you'd find in suburbia - without stoli dolis."}
{"text":"In full disclosure, I have been boycotting this place since they botched my wedding rehearsal party 2.5 years ago. A bride never forgets.

However, I was forced back there this week with co-workers. I was seated in a booth with an enormous hole in the center (think toilet). The black bean sliders were bland and mushy, served on a dry bun (guacamole was promised, but not delivered), with the tiniest shred of rubbery cheese on top. Two of us ordered this and both of us agreed - never again. I tried a bite of the truffle fries and they were pretty good. Although, I would eat cardboard if you drizzled enough truffle oil on it. The Guinness is solid, for America.  

The kicker. They inquired about whether they could seat another party in our booth - like, with us. It took everyone by surprise but me, since that was the same thing did for my wedding rehearsal dinner. Two parties in the same room.  But that time they didn't ask."}
{"text":"brocach means \"badger hole\"  so that's what we'll call it.  the chicken is excellent.  its the only thing i've ever had there.  they don't have beamish."}
{"text":"Loved this place before, now that it's all redone, I'm a little concerned. It seems like there was absolutely no staff training, and if there was they don't care about customer service at all. We sat at the bar, wanted to get a couple appetizers with drinks and the bartender didn't give us menus or water without us asking for them... because he said \"it's hard to tell who comes and goes.\" Which, understandable, but it wasn't busy. Then we asked how the smoked salmon came, wondering if we should share it, the bartender said \"I'm not sure, we're new so I don't know\" then turned around and walked away, without asking anyone or coming back to us with an answer.. he wasn't wearing black so I'm guessing he was a manager, which seems odd to be a manager and be that rude to your customers and basically ignore them. He also asked us if we were done at the end, I said \"yes\" and he didn't bring us the check, we had to wait for him to come back to us after 15 minutes to ask for it. Now I love Broach, but having the bartender walk around with a giant ego, and not care about the customers or the menu at all does not work well for the new appearance of the restaurant. Sad."}
{"text":"Went here to meet a friend for a few drinks and apps. I went in to ask the host to put me at a table outside. After that, I was not acknowledged for almost 20 minutes. I checked how much time had elapsed- to make sure I wasn't tripping. For real- no \"hello\", \"be right with you\", not even a glass of water or menus. I watched other outdoor patrons being helped and chatted with while I was not even given a glance. I saw lots of scurrying and wasted motion, which gave the clear impression of a very scattered and inefficient staff.  Finally, a server seemed to notice me. I do not fault her- she was really nice, actually. I think the place is just not run well, and the staff reflects that confusion.

I had a cup of clam chowder that tasted like it was from a can and a very bland and inadequately boozy Bloody Mary. Soon after, my friend showed up and had one drink. He had a Bucky Book coupon for a \"special entree\"- none of which appealed to him, so he didn't have anything. A vodka tonic was what he ended up having. The other food I've had there has been bland and overpriced. The Scotch eggs are alright, but they are TINY. If not for my friend's suggestion, I wouldn't have considered going there. I usually refer to Brocach as Irish Disney Land. That about sums this place up..."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I was like like... whoa. This is terrible.

Basically, this place used to be like an actual Irish pub with lots of dark wood, low lighting, and squishy booths. Totally my kind of place. Now it is a start white industrial hipster hangout with the worst scary bright lights and it is SO loud.

I was not pleased. I used to love this place. It was one of my favorite spots downtown because of the chill ambiance and pub-like interior. They totally ruined all of that. I wish they would have kept it how it was.

However, onto the positive. I ordered a strip steak and it was absolutely fantastic. Cooked perfectly. The brussel sprouts it came with were absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes were on point. The two people I was with both ordered the fish fry which they said was excellent. Honestly some of the best food I've had at a restaurant in awhile. A little pricey but I'd say it's mostly worth it. If the inside and atmosphere wasn't so terrible, I would have given this a strong five stars.

Also, our waitress was lovely and even though she was very busy, she was attentive and kind.

I definitely suggest eating here, but not at a busy time unless you want to be screaming at whoever you're with to have a conversation. Also, wear make up because that lighting isn't doing anyone any favors."}
{"text":"We visited Brocach for dinner during their recent restaurant week.

First the good.  It was easy to get a reservation and were seated immediately when we arrived. Our server was friendly and checked on us at appropriate intervals throughout the meal. When it was obvious one member of our party was not enjoying her dessert the server offered to bring her another choice. The location is great and the atmosphere sets the mood well. 

Unfortunately the food was underwhelming to say the least. Appetizers were disappointing - the beer and cheese flavors overwhelmed the mussels, and the bread served with them was so crisp as to be useless sopping up the broth. The salad was OK but included tasteless canned beets which would have been better left out. 

I was having trouble deciding between two entrees and asked the server for a recommendation. The sweet potato crusted whitefish she recommended was bland and lackluster. I honestly don't know why anyone would recommend it, other than that they were told to push it. The accompanying risotto was creamy but again tasteless.  Both I and one of the other people I was dining with doused fish & risotto in the vinaigrette to make them edible.

Our other dining companion had the lamb roast, which was much better.  For dessert, the bread pudding was good, but the creme brulee was a disaster. The sugar was so thick that the top was burnt and the bottom layer was still unmelted crystals while the \"creme\" was a watery consistency that was wholly unappetizing. 

Overall, the food did not live up to expectations and I would not return."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch turned into a chaotic meal. There were only two tables occupied so we thought we'd have good service. However, the waitress was very inattentive and service was slow. We ordered potato leek soup and they brought us chili instead, stating they were out of the other soup. My salad was missing all of the ingredients except the lettuce. It had to be sent back for cheese, walnuts, and cranberries to be added. The corned beef hash we ordered was very good. The bill was a mess and had to be fixed 3 times to finally get it correct. We would have been significantly overcharged if we didn't speak up. When I told the waitress what the prices were in the menu, she argued with me but then looked and realized the price I told her was the right one."}
{"text":"We've gone to the Brocach on the Square a few times, loving it at first and then being let down a few times. It's been okay, but we stopped saying, \"Oh! Let's go to Brocach!\" Today, we found ourselves in front of a closed Trader Joe's for Easter, so we decided to get dinner instead, and Brocach was the only place open.

We kind of trudged in and waltzed out! The food was great here. I loved the decor -- the high tables and big booths were so luxurious.

First I got a cup of the vegetarian potato leek soup, which was lovely. Derek got the rosemary and salt wings which he devoured. 

The mac n cheese sounded great, but it had kielbasa in it so I decided to try something else (though the waitress said that it's super easy to take it off). Derek got the mac n cheese instead. IT WAS SO GOOD. I am used to restaurant mac n cheese getting lazy and using the presence of a really creamy-looking dish in place of something that actually tastes good. Or, adding bread crumbs on top of a pile of bland as hell dish and calling it gourmet. This dish looked completely unassuming, but the flavors were fantastic. We kept taking another bite and another bite! Ugh, yum.

I had the walnut burger which is vegetarian and had artichoke on top of it. It had cheese or a sauce, I can't remember, and some mixed greens. With the onion bun, so many great flavors were in my mouth. Happy camper 100%.

I think next time we want Brocach, we'll head to the Monroe Street location!"}
{"text":"We just went for brunch again today ... and sad to say, we were disappointed. :( Maybe it's because the first two times were such a success?

Mostly we wanted to point out that the $3 side of asparagus was extremely disappointed, laughable, and totally overpriced. It tasted okay but I assure you, you can do the same thing at home with an oven and some olive oil. They gave us about 6 pieces and just threw them on a plate without any thought for presentation. I felt quite cheated -- it should've been a dollar at the MOST. Boo."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, comfortable atmosphere, tasty food.

I've always enjoyed the Brocach, and feel the new look helps set them apart from some of the others around the square.  The menu has just enough selection to make a night enjoying a few drinks feel comfortable without getting overwhelmed with choices.  One of my top picks for warming up on a cold winter evening or meeting friends downtown."}
{"text":"This place is terrible since the remodel. Certainly not an Irish pub anymore.  This place used to be a wonderful place to get quality liquor and delicious Irish food. On occasion you would catch an Irish band jamming out.  It was a perfect place to take a date, for a cozy nook.  

After the remodel, blah, no different then any of the other sterile overpriced pretentious club environments downtown.  This place has no life and no soul.  The drinks were $10.00 and higher, the food is blah at best and random indie music playing on the overhead stereo. I will never be back."}
{"text":"We stopped at Brocach for dinner one Saturday night after walking around the square and being met with long waits at several of our other dining options. Brocach had available seating and we jumped on the chance to avoid a wait.

Normally, the lack of a wait would make me nervous, but we went with it & I had heard good things about Brocach in the past. I shouldn't have worried, though. The restaurant seemed to fill up within minutes of our arrival and there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated when we leave about an hour later.

Enough about the wait or lack of it - on to the food! My husband was \"starving\", so we got an order of lounge fried immediately. SO GOOD. Although how can fries smothered in melted cheese + bacon be bad? Yep, it can't. I ordered a salad and a cup of potato leek soup for my meal. The soup was delicious, the salad was just ok.

My husband ordered Bangers & Mash at the recommendation of our server. He really enjoyed it. I tried a bite too, and LOVED the added sweetness from the apples. He also ordered a couple of drinks, and enjoyed the large & creative drink menu."}
{"text":"Hours are wrong, poor service.  Decent food."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. Walked in around 8pm at night looking to sit down for an hour or two and make travel plans. I was planning on having a few beers and maybe some food.

I walk in with my friend, both of us nicely dressed and not at all sketchy, and the server walks up to us and says \"excuse me, our kitchen closes at 8pm and our bar closes soon. The other server looked confused and said we close at 11. The third server/bartender looks at us and says oh we close at 9pm. It was really awkward and we were just standing there. They clearly wanted us not to sit in their establishment and buy their products.

Would not step foot in this Brocach again."}
{"text":"So the remodel is done, everyone.  Whitewashed brick walls.  Booths, tables, and chairs are beautifully crafted wood pieces.  There is ironwork all around.   The upstairs looks like the downstairs.  The stairwell to upstairs as switched to the entrance side of the space.  The first and second floors are completely sealed off so that might mean no more noise bleeding from upstairs or down.  I do find the space beautiful.  I'm sure I will enjoy coming here as much as I did the old space.  But I have to admit I missed the warm colors and plush seats.  If the food is good, I can get over it.

My group of friends visited on a bright sunny Farmer's Market Saturday.  One of the out of towners had loved Brocach's when she lived here, so we were happy to find it open.  At our table, we ordered the Mussels, 2 Fish and Chips, 2 Bangers and Mash, and the Rachel sandwich.  Everyone reported everything was very good.  I found my fish's breading to be a bit soggy.  I hope it was just do to the new re-opening.  The Mussels dish was the only one I had not tried in the past and the flavor was really good.  The broth uses Guinness and it's a winner.

I hope to upgrade my stars as the new kitchen gets their footing and the crowds come back."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks not much else. 

Trust me, the Irish aren't known for food for a reason. I've lived in Cork. But I'm guessing even the Irish would prefer something else."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try the beer... I was being cheap that night, and the company I was interviewing for wouldn't cover alcohol expenses.

Scotch eggs were seemingly expensive for what they are ($4.50 for one soft-boiled egg wrapped in a thin layer of sausage and deep-fried). But the BBQ fries were great (like nachos except on a bed of fries instead of chips!), and the Irish stew made with Guinness was really great. Wish I had the recipe!"}
{"text":"Greeted immediately, specials recited.  My friend had the fish and chips, which she said was great, although she didn't share with me.  I had the Reuben.  The waiter said that the corned beef was very lean, which it was - but it was dry and very stringy, and kind of tough.  Pleasant atmosphere, very good service."}
{"text":"Cold as hell and overly sweet would sum up my brunch experience today.   I wouldn't say I had a stellar first time at Brocach.  It was literally the coldest restaurant I've been in-we had a group of 18 people and every single person was unimpressed with the temperature of the restaurant.  If you have a warehouse of a restaurant, you really should be prepared to ensure your customers are not wearing their coats while eating.  Additionally, by the time food gets to your table, its cold too.  No one seemed to complain because I'm guessing at that point, we'd burned so many calories shivering that we were desperate to eat.  

I ordered the carrot and ginger soup-thank goodness they forgot to charge me for it because it was so sweet that I seemed to be able to taste the sugar granules.  I'm not interested in food that a restaurant has to make so sweet that you can't taste any other flavors.  My quiche was huge...quantity over quality.  The crust was soggy and really just not very good.  The salad had a dressing that seemed to be sprinkled with sugar dressing.  

The servers were nice and the restaurant itself is beautiful but that was about it."}
{"text":"Try the Bangers and Mash...they make it with an apple sauce that is really good!"}
{"text":"Came here for a party upstairs and had a good time.  I was really impressed with the ambiance of the upstairs, the furniture however looked nasty.  I don't want to think of everything that happened on those sofas over the last 40 years.
We just had some appetizers which were good and the service was very friendly.  I think it is a good location for a big get together.  They let us take over the tv and music and were very patient and kind."}
{"text":"Visited Brocach on a Friday with high hopes for their Friday Fish Fry, and despite a small letdown, it was great!

Online, Brocach on the Square advertises their Friday Fish Fry Special as  the \"Traditional Wisconsin Fish Fry: choose baked or fried cod, choice of potato (hand-cut fries, Colcannon mash or baked sweet), rye bread, house-made tartar\". The part about this description that had me hooked was the option to have a baked sweet potato as my side. I LOVE sweet potatoes, and man oh man a baked sweet tater sounded so amazing with my fish. Well....... turns out, they don't have sweet potatoes to serve baked at Brocach. Womp. I was super bummed, but still stuck with the Fish Fry and tried the Colcannon mash instead. 

So anyways, we ate at the bar, had friendly service, and the food arrived after 20 minutes or so. The fish fry was so good! I wasn't so sad that they didn't have the sweet potato after trying the Colcannon mash - mmmmm yep it was good. Had green onions in it and the skin from the potatoes, and maybe more? Not sure, but it was tasty. I opted for the baked fish, which was good and they gave me three pieces. The coleslaw was super tasty too! And the rye bread was perfectly toasted and so soft. Overall, a wonderful meal that filled me up but didn't leave me feeling overstuffed and yucky like some fish fry's do to me. 

I would definitely return to Brocach for a fish fry, and I know it's on my list of places to go when I'm looking for some yummy Irish dishes!"}
{"text":"HOLY SMOKES the burger was HUGE. I had to take a break in between bites to regain my composure before digging in again.
It was our first time in an Irish place but we weren't too adventurous. The Hail Mary although big, wasn't our fav Madison burger. 
Spinach and artichoke dip (see my pic) was really generous and we were totally filled up on that before the burger even arrived! That is a \"must order\" if you go!"}
{"text":"Friday's are great here. No need to wait late for the music as the band fires up about 5:30 strumming, singing, piping and thumping away to the emjoyment of the usually packed crowd. I'd put a sample here on Yelp, but no video upload capability on Y.

You may have to wait for a table, but no worries as you'll get to be even closer ear to the musix going on in the bar area.

The usual beverages are here with Happy Hour til 6pm.

I liked the Wedge House Sirloin Salad.

Cooked to order, it arrived a nice medium rare. The wedge is amply sized and drizzled wth a blue cheese then a slight French dressing. 

Delicious and perfectly portioned."}
{"text":"Great little pub! The decor made me feel like I was sitting in a pub in the UK. The menu offers traditional British pub fare with a Wisconsin twist. Our very friendly server recommended the burgers and they were delicious.  I truly enjoyed my meal and the service. The Ginger Old Fashioned was a fantastic cocktail!"}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch or dinner. Wonderful beer and cocktail selection. The ginger and Jameson specialty cocktail they have is to die for! We visited for lunch and I got the black bean burger which was wonderful...you can't go wrong with a pretzel bun. But I have to say my friend won for best meal. She got the pulled pork sandwich which is incredible. The meat is shredded nicely and is no tender plus it comes with sweet potato fries...GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES!  Overall the atmosphere was wonderful (however it does get SUPER crowded in the evening) and service was very pleasant. Every time I come to Madison from St. Louis I always end up here and I am sure I will be back. The only reason I left a star off is that the cocktails are great but overall a little pricey compared to other establishments around town."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and our large party enjoyed the variety of beers on tap. As a vegetarian, I had many options, two of which proved to be delicious: the potato leek soup and the cheddar melt. Our waitress, Tasha, was pretty rude though. I'm guessing she ignored us and gave us terrible service because she knew she was guaranteed the 18% for our group of 8 or more."}
{"text":"I want this place to be great because it's so convenient to my house, and my kids like it.  But it's not great.  I ordered my daughter a brunch off the kids menu:  egg and cheese scrambler with whole wheat toast and a side of fruit.  What came was an egg and cheese scrambler with white toast and a heaping helping of fried potatoes.  Our waiter was perfectly nice about it -- when I asked her about the fruit, she looked at the menu, agreed it was supposed to come with fruit, and brought out a plate of fruit.  And when I asked her about the toast, she brought out some whole wheat toast.  Still, it's troublesome when what's brought out is different in so many ways from the dish on the menu.

The reviewer who described the breakfasts as capable of feeding 3-4 people must have had very small people in mind.  The eggs Benedict I got today was a single half-muffin, one poached egg, one slice of ham.  That the brunch filled me up at all was due to yet another large pile of fried potatoes.  They were good!  But a brunch of fried potatoes with a side of eggs benedict was not what I had in mind.   

The place was almost empty, but after waiting a while I had to get up and walk to the bar in order to get my coffee refilled.

If the food were great, all this stuff would be no problem.  And the food isn't bad!  But it's ordinary.  The quality is about the same as at Mickie's Dairy Bar, the greasy spoon up the street -- but Mickie's gives you twice as much ordinary food at half the cost.  Which I guess is why they're always full and we were one of only three tables eating at Brocach."}
{"text":"I'll have a Guinness, please.

This place is great. I love the fact that you can come here and be social and chat up new friends, or stick to the blokes you came in with. The main-level bar area has always seemed to me to be more conducive to socializing among the crowd, whereas the bar upstairs has seemed less so. And, if you're really looking to isolate your crew from the crowd, there are plenty of large (high-backed) booths to choose from too.

I imagine if there's any bar in town where you can get a Guinness mixed drink that goes beyond the cliché Black & Tan, this would be the place.

The one thing that really needs the management's attention is the one-holer men's room. I'm not sure about the ladies facilities, but it's got to be the most awkward men's room I've ever used.

Now, about that Guinness?"}
{"text":"The food is always serviceable, the service is generally good, and one of my favorite drinks can be found here.

Although it's not an Irish concoction, Brocach serves something called the Stoli Doli. Basically it's a martini made from vodka which has pineapple soaking in it all day. I was a patron of Capital Grill in Washington, DC - home of the original Stoli Doli. I like to hit Brocach occasionally when I am feeling nostalgic for my time there.

Brocach can be a little cramped, but usually it's a good time. I've certainly enjoyed myself at the various private events I've attended upstairs."}
{"text":"Let me say that in the beginning, way, way back, Brocach was excellent.  We just stopped in earlier this evening for dinner and wow, what a terrible change.  Brocach is no more an Irish Pub than McDonalds is a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  Like everything else downtown it has been gentrified, catering to the yuppie wannabes that inhabit the downtown of Madison these days.

The menu is decidedly crap.  The couple of dishes that are named after traditional Irish fare are nothing close to the real deal.  Aside from the menu having been butchered and cut down to about 1/4 of its original size it offers nothing that cannot be found within a few blocks in any direction.  We were so disgusted with the choices (hamburger on an English Muffin?  Really?) we just went for the fish and chips.  Our daughter went for shepherds pie off of the kiddie menu.

The fish was nothing great.  We've had better elsewhere to be sure.  What dug at me was that there were no condiments on the tables.  Apparently you get what they feel you should have in terms of simple things like ketchup, which comes in a tiny little plastic dish.  My daughter hated the shepherds pie.  I switched with her and she was right to hate it.  Terrible.  I've been making shepherds pie for over thirty years (if it has beef and not lamb, it's cottage pie, by the way Brocach) from a recipe my grandparents brought over.  I know a thing or two about Irish fare and none of this garbage was it.  I may be Irish American, but I am all Irish, and what we experienced tonight was nothing Irish.  It was Madison Yuppie/Hipster cuisine served up in a faux pub setting.

If you think you know Irish food, or what an Irish pub actually is, but in truth know nothing about it then by all means head to Brocach.  You can enjoy a completely false perspective on both.  However, if you are looking for real Irish food, in a real Irish setting (painting gaelic phrases on a wall does not an Irish Pub make), run as far away from Brocach as you can.  It's am embarrassment to all things Irish.

We will not be returning.  There is nothing authentic about the place.  The atmosphere is just Wisconsin Boozehound, like every other tavern in the state, not at all Irish.  This is an example of the need to have laws prohibiting places from naming themselves Irish Pub, Greek Tavern, Italian Restaurant, etc... when they are so far from the real thing they should be embarrassed.

If you want to hit a real Irish Pub, you need to head to Chicago or New York or Boston for a spot-on experience.  Note that you will only find these places in the crappy parts of town.  No self-respecting Irish Pub will be on a posh neighborhood.  Better yet, go to Ireland.

Just don't go to Brocach."}
{"text":"CORNED BEEF HASH. 

It is good and you should get it. 

The slow cooked corned beef, caramelized onion, and house potatoes are all just beautiful. Add some egg whites, wheat toast and asparagus and life is good."}
{"text":"We went to Brocach's during the last day of restaurant week and were seated right away!  I had the Beer Cheese burger and it was really good!  The atmosphere was fun and it wasn't too loud to hold a conversation.  There's a ton of delicious sounding food on the menu, so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Appetizers
Buffalo wings: 4.5 stars, sauce was on point
Clam Chowder: 5 stars
Drinks:
Black Barrel Old Fashion: 4.5, quality and strong, would be a 5 @ $8
Main Courses:
Roasted Half Chicken: 3 stars, Chicken was dry
Smoked Salmon starter: 4 stars, little cold, bread was too soft"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad atmosphere, mediocre food. It would be great to a have a nice Irish pub in Madison. Perhaps Cooper's Tavern on the square fits that bill, but Brocach on Monroe definitely does not. I don't know how this place is in business. If you are in the area do yourself a favor and go to Brasserie V down the street, much better food and service, plus an impressive beverage selection."}
{"text":"This place was cool and comfy prior to the remodel, now it's stark and just blah. They ruined the charm of one of the coolest places to eat in Madison. The food is good though!"}
{"text":"Decent Irish brunch. Best thing about the place is that there aren't any long queues.. but then it might be a bad thing.. I kinda liked it"}
{"text":"Decent enough spot for afternoon drinks and apps. Grabbed a spot at the bar easily enough on a Saturday afternoon. Decent draft beer selection, as well as craft cocktails. Tried a Bloody while we were there...one of the better made Mary's I've had. Partook in a scotch egg as well... Decent flavor but a tad dry. Presentation was solid, and the pickled onions and greens salad paired very well. Might not be our first stop during a Madison visit, but will most likely be on the itinerary. Not many places like it downtown, and the food menu begs for subsequent visits. PS solid bar service!"}
{"text":"Faux-exposed brick?  Fuck you, Brocach.  Small menu but the food's pretty decent.

update: I can't get an appertizer at 4 PM?  As the kids say \"omgwtf?!\""}
{"text":"My husband and I started out with the beer cheese dip appetizer.  It was delicious.  It was 4 generous pieces of amazing pretzel bread accompanied by slices of bell peppers and carrot sticks.  The beer cheese dip was great...I maybe could have used just a little bit more though...we ate every last bit of the dip.  For dinner, my husband order the corned beef and cabbage entree.  After insisting to him that I do not like corned beef, he finally got me to try it.  I bet he wishes he wouldn't have...because after that I was sneaking bits of meat off his plate for the rest of the meal.  It had so much flavor and it almost melted in my mouth because it was so tender.   I would highly recommend trying it!   I ordered the shepherd's pie which was also delicious.  It's the perfect comfort food...meat and veggies topped with delicious mashed potatoes.  It's a very hearty meal, and I thoroughly enjoyed my leftovers the next day.

They also had live music which was very nice."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great meal and above average service by our waitress.  My dining companion and I split the Beer Cheese dip and it was delicious!  It is warm, smooth and creamy, and has just the right amount of heat.  It is served with some soft, warm pretzels and some raw carrots and red peppers.  Had I been alone, I could have made a meal from this.  We both had a cup of potato leek soup, that was also very good and it comes with a warm brown bread muffin, made in house.  We were already full after that but wanted to try an entree, so we asked to split the fish and chips.  Our waitress brought it out split evenly on two separate plates.  It was a nice surprise as we had expected to split it ourselves.  The fish and fries were both hot, crisp and tasty.  I did not try the coleslaw because by then I was just too full.  The decor is warm and beautiful, and our waitress was very personable without being overbearing.  She gets an A+ for keeping my water glass full.  

I was a little surprised at some of the prices, but that would be my only criticism.  Burgers are $12 and our lunch fish and chips was $14.  It seems a little pricey, but the quality of the food is good.  Oh wait...one more thing...the paint job in the restroom is a little disturbing, looks like a blood bath took place, I was not a fan."}
{"text":"Today at Brocach was a total miss.  My boyfriend ordered the poutine with corn beef which came out so cold the cheese curds didn't melt into the fries.  Corn beef had great flavor though.  I ordered the crab cake eggs benedict.  It was served barely warm and one of the crab cakes was about half the size of the other one.  I later ordered a pancake from the menu and was told they took pancakes off the menu. When I asked why they were still on the menu if they weren't offering them anymore the server checked with the kitchen and they made the pancake.  I was grateful but when the pancake was served it was half their normal size.  Don't know what was up with Brocach today but they had the B or C Team working the kitchen."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! The folks I was with loved the Irish plates. I had the hamburger that had huge flavor!

Worth a try if your on the Madison square!!"}
{"text":"Great Irish pub in Madison.  Love the decor inside and out in the front patio. You don't feel like you're in Madison anymore. 
Excellent fish and chips here, BUT I have noticed that over the years, the portions for fish and chips have gotten smaller.  It makes me want to come only on the days when they serve all you can eat fish and chips. I think, Fridays???

The roast chicken is another one of my favorites at Brocach. yum.

If you want something on the healthier side, order the greek salad with chicken."}
{"text":"I usually have nothing but good experiences when going to Madison and finding places to eat but this is one we won't be coming back to. I recall this location being a much more friendly place but I'm not sure if it's new ownership over the last few years, whatever it is... not good. The environment is not welcoming, prices are way too high for what you get, food is terrible and I could go on and on. I'll just say this, don't bother going here. They don't play the local games if something from Boston is on at the time."}
{"text":"I had my wedding after party at Brocach and while I had a fabulous time, I unfortunately cannot provide a good review of the venue. 

1) The music was inaudible and they would not turn up the music even after several requests and promises to do so.
2) Even though bar close is listed as 2am (on Yelp) and we still had dozens of people present, they closed the bar around midnight on a Saturday.
3) There was some confusion about tip being included on our bar tab and even though the general manager Marcos Jimenez assured us repeatedly that we could get reimbursed he has been non-responsive to e-mails and phone calls and we have not received the reimbursement more than a month later.

We loved the location on the square and the upstairs area is free to reserve and quite spacious. We had a great time despite the annoyances listed above but would definitely not recommend it for the above reasons. if Marcos ever follows through with issue #3 we'd consider increasing our rating to two or three stars."}
{"text":"Noise level on a busy Friday night is definitely NOT quiet. We ordered the fish fry which was good. Unfortunately we substituted an extra portion of cole slaw for the fries (chips). The fish was served on a mountain of cole slaw, tart with vinegar. Next time I'll just eat the chips and have a great meal. We will go back for the great ambiance and service."}
{"text":"We stopped in from the Dane County Farm Market for brunch.  Great food, surprising for an Irish pub.  In spite of its location on the square, it was not busy, we were seated immediately, and service was excellent."}
