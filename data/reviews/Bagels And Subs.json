{"text":"Great food and lots of options. I had the the bagel egg and cheese, a strawberry smoothie. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to stop in and get a torta (sandwich). I always get the Cuban torta and have never been disappointed and the food is always consistent regardless of who makes it. My second go to item is the bacon cheese hot dog, which is extremely good and they use all beef hot dogs which make it that much better. 

The shop is a bit small with a few tables so it can fill up rather quickly but the staff here is very nice to deal with and have never had bad customer even as they have been busy with to go orders and customers inside. Bagels and Subs is definitely worth a stop for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price! And the people were really nice!  Very happy customer. 
We ordered a Gyro, and a turkey & cheese croissant..  they were both really good. I would totally go back again."}
{"text":"These people are very polite and friendly! It's a cost spot that gives you that at home feeling. They're food is served fresh and their frappuccinos are on the strong side. I love it!!"}
{"text":"Great food! My favorite things to eat here are the croissant and la torta yummy!! =P Not to mention the milk shakes and the delicious coffee they  make! I love the salsa de chile chipotle. Don Jose and the owner are very nice and friendly.  I sent my friends here to get breakfast and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"Yeah. It was ok. The lady was nice. I thought there was going to be more of a smoothie type option but not really. Got two breakfast sandwiches.  I mostly won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a great pastrami sandwich. I couldn't believe how cheap it was (I even asked the girl working if she had charged me for everything to make sure). The food was all fresh and tasted great. Glad I stumbled across the place."}
{"text":"The ceiling tiles look old, half of the fountain drinks are \"out\", and the decor is a mess, but there's just something about this place.  It feels like you're sitting in your favorite aunt's new restaurant who needs help getting the place to take off.  The young lady who helped me was very friendly and accommodating when I asked for recommendations.  The Torta Loca and the chocolate and banana milkshake were delicious, but even more than that, this place had a vibe of a local favorite sandwich stop, which you had to kind of be a local to understand.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overall I really love this joint. Their subs are delicious, their bagels are delicious, their bagel sandwiches are delicious, and they are fairly priced. The owner is typically always there keeping a watchful eye and restocking their fridge. They make the food right in front of you, no secret kitchen hidden behind some wall. All fresh and all made the way you like it!"}
{"text":"One of the only places I know I can find a really good Cuban sandwich. Just absolutely great food. The lady who works there is friendly and listens to what you order. Make sure to tip her. She deserves it."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a volleyball tournament and was off the strip. Wanted to get breakfast but not sit down, in times past it was hard to find a local bagel place other then an einsteins. 

I saw Hugo's review and decided to try the place out, and it was amazing. 

I love breakfast bagels and this was one of the best I have had. The bagel was soft and the eggs were cooked with pepper, the sausage and cheese topped it off.  15 min we were in and out feeling good about the rest of the day."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure! On the corner of Sahara and Lamb, it's a tiny place but the sandwiches are amazing! I got the grilled chicken sub, which comes with chipotle sauce and jalapeños, as well as normal sandwich toppings.  I expected to have to pick some of the jalapeños off, but nope. She made a perfect sandwich! All the flavors worked and the bread was so fresh and perfectly grilled. I ate an entire 12\" sandwich. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this little place. They don't speak English, however they were accommodating to my broken Spanish. I had the mango smoothie and tostilocos,which was interesting but yummy. I definitely  want to go back there before I move from the east side. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Because of this location i can imagine they don't get much foot traffic, i happened to be in the area to get my windshield replaced and i am so glad a stumbled upon this place. I ordered a wrap which had chicken, bacon, tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado and lettuce and let me tell you everything was soooooo fresh! It was amazing i literally haven't had any fast food that has every tasted so fresh. This place is definitely worth checking out. My only complaint is the soda machine everything was out of order luckily they did have a fully stocked fridge."}
{"text":"Best family owned bagel,sandwich and coffee shop in East Las Vegas! 

Very fresh,clean and friendly"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Great food.  I come here every two weeks for breakfast. You all have to try the fresh juice and panini Italian sub. Just amazing!!!  Customer service is good. Price, we'll I dnt mind paying two more dollars more for fresh ingredients. I'm sure you all understand this."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have to be honest, I walked in and thought \"great, another guy who wants a bagel shop.\"  Oh boy was I wrong!  This place is so amazing!  It will be my new go-zoo for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were immediately greeted. I ordered an onion bagel with cream cheese with a coffee and my husband ordered an egg, ham and cheese croissant sandwich. It all came to about $6.00. The coffee was fresh and so was the bagel. My husband really liked his sandwich and he is very picky. I liked that it was quiet and we could chill and enjoy our Sunday morning. I'd like to go back and try some of their other drinks and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I got an Italian sub and a strawberry shake. The sub was excellent except for simply not having enough meat on it, but it still tasted delicious. The strawberry shake tasted like milk. And he offered to remake it and though I told him no, he remade it anyways. But it still had very little taste at all. But I will give him an \"A\"  for his customer service. All in all, not bad, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very friendly man working here. We were looking for a bagel place -- and they had only 5 or 6 kinds. My egg and cheese on jalapeño bagel was good. Fox News was on in the background so we ate outside."}
{"text":"A little whole in the Wall with good bagel sandwiches, great pricing! If I'm in this part of town I'll visit for sure!"}
