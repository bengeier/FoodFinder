{"text":"AWESOME place! Found it through this site and got the recommended dishes of Pan Tai, fried rice and then yellow curry!!! Yum! Dishes are spicy so review helped me keep it at 2 which was perfect. Our second visit tried Beef PHO which was fabulous! Best I have had! Rounded off with doughnuts for dessert! Great service and great food! A place to not miss!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered this at work one day, and now have gone back at least 5 times. It gets better every time. The Pad See Ewe a must. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but even if you add spice to it, its still good. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed given the 4.5 star yelp rating, and such a long drive from the strip to get there.  Aside from the entrees which qualify for the $ rating (around $9, add another $1 for a small bowl of rice), our appetizer and soup were definitely $$$.  Shrimp Tom Yum soup for 5.95 was a personal serving size; we ordered two portions for the four of us, and it was two strips each of red and green bell pepper and a total of 7 shrimps (I should have asked if one portion would be 3.5 shrimps).    Curry and pad tai noodle were of good flavors, but beef was overcooked and the dishes are definitely not 4.5 stars standard.  Afterward we became convinced that because the merchant had a paid-advertisement on yelp that it had gotten bonus points by yelp.  Oh and, the place has an open kitchen, so you will smell somewhat when you leave. The first impression of it is a fast-food joint."}
{"text":"Decent prices, authentic food, SPICY  Whatever spice lvl you're used to getting, go down about 2-3. I thought I was manly and got a lvl 8 pad-see-ew... was literally tearing, my friend had a good laugh. It depends on the dish though as my friends chicken was fine (also an 8). Definitely recommend if your into Thai food"}
{"text":"We tried Pan Asian for the first time on Saturday afternoon and didn't know what to expect.  We were extremely happy and thought the food and service were exceptional - my wife is not a fan of Thai or Asian food, but she very much enjoyed the selection and quality of the food.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistent great!  I have eaten here many times in the past few years every time I am in Vegas.  I usually do not like Thai food from other restaurants because they make everything very sweet.  Pan Asian knows how to serve good food and the service is excellent. Try anything in the menu because you will not be disappointed.    I always like to support small local family businesses so even though this restaurant is away from the Strip, I always make the effort to come here.  After I am done with dinner, I leave very happy because I just had quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love this place! Crying Tiger salad is the a must!!! Can't go wrong with drunken noodles! Mr. Wong and the staff are so welcoming and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"3rd time visiting and I am amazed how delicious the food is here. Great chef! Friendly atmosphere, very clean, small, family oriented. The only downer is that they don't serve alcohol. Sapporo would be nice with the pad thai =)"}
{"text":"best Thai food , been here so many times. Everything on the menu is good . Its a family business and they treat their customers great. Food is delicious , prices are great and the restaurant is very clean !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything thing I've tried at this restaurant. The stir fried linguini is one of the best dishes I've ever had. The staff are very nice and it's comfortable and a good atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas regardless of cost. The food is excellent, but what makes this place really superb is the service. The owner remembers everyone and remembers exactly how each customer likes a dish. For example I usually get dishes without egg added but one time I decided to get egg in the dish. After placing my order the server was sent back to confirm I really wanted egg in the dish. This level of detail is what makes this place wonderful. My favorite dish here is the drunken noodles which I feel is better than any other Thai restaurant in Vegas. The curries are nice too. This place is very vegetarian friendly as well."}
{"text":"Still the best choice of Thai food you can have in town. Tasty, fresh and affordable, exceptional costumer service, friendly atmosphere. Thank you David and Lisa for your wonderful food and service!"}
{"text":"David was really attentive & made us feel like Home. The service & food are excellent Give yourself a treat and check this place out! It truly is a hidden gem:)"}
{"text":"Best asian food ive had in Las Vegas thus far, everything we tried was amazing tiger salad, tom ka soup, pad see ooo, fried ice cream! The salad is still something i crave and its been like a week! Staff was extremely friendly and made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything was filled with so many wonderful flavors. And the owner was a great host. An excellent experience."}
{"text":"all i have to say is that this place is addicting!  i find myself really craving the linquine.  its soo yummy!!!  and the owner and chef are very hospitable.  with del mar cafe and pan asian in the same mall i can have my breakfast lunch and dinner!  my two favorite places in w. las vegas"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Thai food.  Best Pad See Ew in town.  Even when I changed my diet to a more plant-based diet, I started getting just the Vegetable Pad See Ew, and it still tastes amazing.  The panang curry is really good as well, so is the DW Fried Rice.. nomnomnom!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious,  We have been at this restaurant several times, and it never disappoints us, food is hot , fast, simple and really really good!!! The young lady who always takes care of us, well she's on point. Well done guys,keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, but very spicy. We had a spice level of 3 out of 10, and it was still very spicy, and we are from New Orleans.  Watch the spice level & you will love it. Very casual."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place but nice ,clean, and modern ....  The staff was very attentive and clean .  Every dish was GREAT ! Had the pad Thai , wonton soup , basil rice and curry chicken...   Fried ice cream was delicious"}
{"text":"Had hopes of eating on the awesome patio but rain stopped that hope.  Inside was nice, casual, rather unmemorable.  Cocktail menu is imaginative.  Did not care for the Spiced Sangria (all mango)? but the special drink of the night was very good.  Appreciate the half price happy hour till 7pm.  The California roll was great...fresh and flavorful.  I had the  KFC Bowl which was great--plentiful and the flavors were great.  Lot of Korean BBQ chicken, roasted cord and fresh perfectly cooked brussel sprouts.  Partner had the noodle dish which was awesome.  This is a place to come back to and bring friends!! Great food!!"}
{"text":"We eat at least once a week and have never been disappointed.  The chefs are passionate about making great food. The food is so fresh and you can tell a lot of prep goes into each dish.   All I can say is great food, great service and great price!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas. When I go to other Thai restaurants I find my self comparing their dishes with the ones. Every dish has amazing flavor. I usually order a 7 on the spice scale. The dish comes with heat but you'll never lose the original flavor of the dish. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the envirement at this restaurant. The customer service was great and they were very happy and sweet. I had the phad thai and it was delicious. I will make sure to go back."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Their curry and wonton soup are amazing! Prices are great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, a family run business. So delicious! The food is very consistent. We love the drunken noodles & beef pho soup. We've always gotten excellent service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had potstickers and shrimp spring rolls for our appetizers. The appetizers were fresh, crispy, and delicious. For our entree I had the Beef Pho and my fiancé had Pork Ribs with XO sauce. The pho was amazing! I got heat level 6 and man it was hot so be careful. The Ribs were tender and the meat was falling off the bones. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Referred by a friend who asked \"do you like great Thai food?\", my answer \"yes and I have had some really good Thai but not great locally\". Instructed to order slow roasted duck not on the regular menu it was fantastic! As was the pad Thai, and soup."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here and the commitment to authentic Asian recipes. The Singapore noodles were fantastic... a hard order to fill once you've had them in Singapore! The wait staff was excellent and took the time to answer our questions and determine our spice level which was varied at the table. Their red curry with pumpkin and baby eggplant was delightful-- aromatic and the perfect blend of sweet and savory Everything was served beautifully. They even make their own ground pepper sprinkle, which adds more spice when you need it.  Lastly, we saw another table order fried ice cream and thus did the same. A dough filled with shaved coconut, not too sweet, deep fried, surrounding a creamy middle. What a way to go!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 star not really 4.   Tom yum soup shrimp. I ordered spicy level 5...and it was spicy. Yummy flavor. Had noodles which I didn't expect but also didn't mind.   Chicken garlic pepper shrimp- spicy level 2. This was ok. Neither me or my husband felt like it was extraordinary in taste or anything. In fact we found the chicken to be chewy.   Beef sliced Thai basil spicy level 3- I liked the sauce and veggies were crisp but barely any meat! Like few pieces of beef. And very small pieces of meet. So overall not that impressed with food but peo were nice and place was clean"}
{"text":"Two words. Cheesecake Tempura. Why doesn't this exist everywhere? No matter how full you are, order desert.   Pre-desert I ordered the Massaman Curry. The Avacodo was unreal. And the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and other veggies were cooked to a perfection I have yet to accomplish in my own kitchen.   Way worth the drive off the strip. And if you have been eating on the strip you will be shocked at the prices. The good kind of shock."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic SE Asian meals. I went with a red curry and satay... Both were delicious. Having just returned from a trip to Asia, my palate was well prepared to compare.  Do yourself a favor and try"}
{"text":"Talk about tasty food!! By far my favorite pho!! I have recommended this place to my freinds and co workers too!!"}
{"text":"Le Thai : Hip, Downtown Eatery :: Pan Asian : Made with Love, Family Kitchen  I heard good things about Pan Asian and finally got to try it out when I was on this side of town.  It's in a little strip of buildings, next to nothing in particular and we almost drove past it.  When we got inside we knew it was our kind of place: small, homey feel with super friendly owners.  I don't need some stuffy restaurant on The Strip- give me a place like this any day!  After being told they could make many of their menu items vegetarian, we decided to let them call the shots.  I wanted a curry and a noodle so David (I think that was his name) said we should get the Massaman Curry and the Stir Fried Linguini.    The curry was made with veggies and tofu and had a nice flavor to it.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I only wish that it had a little more spice (we ordered medium) and some more veggies (it looked a little soupy, even for a curry).  The noodles had a good amount of heat (also medium), lots of flavor, and were packed full of fresh vegetables.  I was actually pretty surprised at the amount and quality of veggies I was given.  This was my favorite dish of the two.    We also ordered a Thai Tea and Fried Ice Cream.  Both were good, but I have favorites elsewhere.  In all, I felt like I was invited to someone's home for dinner when I was here.  The owners are very warm and want to make you are as happy as possible while providing great-tasting and comforting food."}
{"text":"My mom, daughter and I arrived at 6:30 and the restaurant was basically bare. (The ambiance is kind of weird. My daughter wasn't feeling the print on the wall.) One would think with the lack of patrons would allow for the server to make you feel relaxed and take her time to explain things. NOT, I had to ask about the featured dishes and she never told us her name. We had questions about items on the menu that weren't explained to us because our server kept walking away. She was very inattentive & seemed annoyed at our inquisitive requests.  We ordered the shrimp tempura, to start, which was just, ok. Then we ordered the featured sushi roll, torched tuna. My mom, who's not a big fan of sushi really liked the featured dish & asked the price because she was interested in ordering another. She quoted $19. Why wouldn't she warn us? The waitress that is. The most expensive sushi on the menu was $16.9.  I was disappointed with the service and my appetite was ruined. I had some confusion with the Groupon I was using, the manager came over & clarified matters and we order the Chang Mai Cauliflower which was delicious.  Between the poor service & just decent food, I probably won't be hastening back there. However,  the happy hour from 5-7 and ALL drinks are half off, maybe the one thing that pulls me in. I got the Orient Express, it was delicious. My mom's drink was pretty good too.   I miss Tamari. The service and food at PAN doesn't hold a light to Tamari. For those of us spoiled by Tamari, this restaurant is a slight disappointment."}
{"text":"Awesome, some of the best thai food I've ever had.  The owner is usually working and is an awesome guy.  The panang curry is some of my favorite ever.  Every dish I've had was great, and you have to try the fried cheesecake! omnom!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Pan, but was very disappointed. I kind of had a feeling I would be, considering the place is dead any time I go by.   They have such a great space, with cool outdoor seating, and it's such a shame this place isn't more of a buzz.   Terrible service. The super nice line cook had to go find our server for us.   Too pricey for the quality. Entrees run you about $15-20, and again, were not that great. The Korean fried chicken was fine..painfully average. Boyfriend got the duck tacos and thought the same.   If the price was lower or the quality was better, I would come back. Other than that, I'll pass. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a variety of Asian cuisine! Went here for the first time for dinner and had quite the time.   The service is excellent here. They were very attentive and friendly.   We started off with the Fried Calamari and Wonton Soup. The calamari was cooked perfectly and was breaded with panko. I had never seen that done before but added a great crisp to the dish. The Wonton soup was amazing. The broth is well developed and delicious. The dumplings were juicy and tasted great!  For entree my fiance got the Rad Nah Noodles and I got the Drunken Noodles. I tried her dish and it was awesome. The vegetables were cook well and not soggy like you find in some restaurants. It was a play on Beef and Broccoli but way better. With the Drunken Noodles I got them with Shrimp. The server let me know their restaurant is the hottest when it comes to spice level. I got 5/10 since it was my first time there. OMG SPICY! The noodles were perfect, shrimp great flavor, but it was incredibly SPICY. The server was awesome though, he saw how I was struggling so was diligent about filling my water. I jokingly said to him to just leave the pitcher and he did! Which worked out well for me because I never had to worry about waiting. Great service!  My only issue with this restaurant is they don't serve any alcohol. Perhaps that was a good thing since I was chugging the water!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick lunch and the food quality was great, tastes were fantastic and prices were reasonable. I will have to return for dinner so I can sample more of the menu. The owners told us that they are planning an official grand opening next week. Welcome to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great! The sushi was fantastic and the meal was incredible!  The cheese cake dessert was to die for!  Came for my girlfriends birthday and was blown away! We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Order anything above spice level 5 and they stand by your table with an extinguisher. J/K if you love spice order the red curry tofu level 8. It's to die for. 2nd best way to heat things up. The staff was super attentive and our drinks were never half empty. I was warned up front of the spice level so there were no surprises except that they actually made it spicy, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"The food is great. have eaten there almost every month for the last year.  I really don't like the fluorescent lighting though. thats the only thing I would change."}
{"text":"Wow!  Awesome Asian food.  We had to try because of the great  reviews.  Glad we did!  Very fresh and tasty ingredients.  Also had chicken garlic pepper at a level 2.  Spicy but great!  Husband got Malaysian curry with chicken at level 4 and loved it!  When are you opening up a restaurant in Milwaukee ;)"}
{"text":"Short Review: Their sushi ranks as one of the best sushi places in Pittsburgh. This is what you need to know. Stop reading this and go eat. I went with a large group of friends so we could all try a little bit of everything.  Full Review: Sushi: very fresh with interesting combinations of flavors, the very definition of fusion sushi done perfectly. My favorites were the seared scallops with coconut-lime sauce and the peppered tuna with smoked jalapeno-mango sauce. The only bad thing I can say about their sushi is that the rice falls apart easily. But seriously, the flavors are so well thought out and perfectly compliment each other. The scallops were melt-in-your-mouth tender and tuna was fresh. I actually recommend trying the sushi without any extra soy sauce. I feel that the creativity of the rolls were perfect on their own.  Small Plates: Shrimp tempura: Fried to a nice crisp without feeling heavy. The sauce was delicious and not too spicy. This was the first thing that came out for us and we knew that this was going to be a great food experience.  Pork belly: the pork belly itself is well seasoned and melts in your mouth. However, they do provide some fried buns to go with it that I felt was unnecessary. I usually like having normal buns, which cuts through the extreme fattiness of the pork belly.  Service: Fantastic. Extremely happy workers. Seriously, good food made better by happy staff.  Overall. I absolutely enjoyed my experience. I think what they do best is their sushi. I will be coming back here soon for their happy hour."}
{"text":"Aaamazing food! Just be careful on your spice level... we've learned the hard way to go with a 2-3 level! I highly recommend the Chicken Tom Khar soup, Crying Tiger salad, Red Curry and Drunken Noodles. Yum!"}
{"text":"Last week in the morning, 1st time to this place. I'd order \"Crying Tiger beef salad\". I was Blown away By the awesomeness...the beef was cooked perfectly, just 100% mouth watering and fresh raw vegetable. The $10 something was worth every penny. I decided to try them again this evening 5:30pm. With Thai coffee including $2.99 delivery and tips, total out $23.50. Boy! What a Horrible quality. It was night and day. There was no Passion put into the plate. But Please excuse my language, i'd end up having to spit out 60% of it out due to the undercook, tough meats. Completely being taken for my $$$. Easiest $23 they ever made. And i'm still Hungry. Man!  I think i gotta start cooking again.  C'mon Pan Asian!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Thai Mom and Pop (Lisa and David) restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oh Pan-Asian I wasn't sure what to take from you. The first app (Vietmanese Chicken Ravioli) we ordered was really, I mean really bland. Not even the hot sauce could redeem it. Great concept but no flavor whatsoever.   The Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad was incredible until I ate a piece of Shrimp. I personally didn't like the grilled taste because the charred pieces really throw off the rest of the salad. If the shrimp was sauteed, man oh man I would order this all the time. It's a perfect blend of sweet and sour. Now I love Basil fried rice and this comes to a close second for best Basil fried rice (Archi's). The yellow curry was surprisingly good as well.   I only saw a couple issues with this place. 1) if you come with more than 3 people you have to sit next to the door. The day we went, we had to sit next to the door. No bueno. 2) Their spicy rating scale is scaled way down. Ordered 8 & 9 but tasted like a 2 or 3 to me. I had even toned it down for the people accompanying me to dinner, normally I do a 10 plus add more hot sauce.   The owner is awesome and it's fun watching the chef do her thing. We did the Yelp deal and um we spent more than we thought. Dang deals make you think you're getting a deal then you order a number of dishes to later realize that the deal true only buys 2 entrees :("}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  My wife and were warmly greeted by the host and owner.  When ordering we were told carefully told about there hear levels.  We got level two because my wife is a wimp.  Could have been a three.  We ordered the drunken noodles and the tofu see ew.  Both were full of flavor and the noodles were great.  Best Asian food I have had in a long time.  Highly recommended.  Will be back with the family."}
{"text":"The food is amazing for a great price and always consistent in the quality of the food and customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Pan Asian has been on my \"to try\" list for what seems like a decade.  We finally travelled  to that side of town to celebrate a friends' birthday dinner.  Sadly, I wasn't that impressed and several members of our group went home that evening with stomach troubles.    We tried a variety of dishes and the ones that really stood out to me were the Malaysian Roti and the Tempura Cheesecake!  The roti was crisp and not too greasy.  The curry sauce on the side was full of flavor but I wished it was a tad thicker.  I didn't expect the cheesecake to be as good as it was - the batter was light and the cheesecake was nice and tangy.    Some other dishes we got were: shrimp salad, fried tofu, basil fried rice, pad see yew, and panang curry.  IMO everything was on the salty side as I feel like I had a gallon of water while I was there.  None of these really stood out to me.  I've had better versions of all these dishes elsewhere.    Restaurant was nicely decorated (really like the open kitchen so you can see what the chefs are up to) and service was top notch.   Maybe I just had such high expectations because I've heard so many good things about this place but it most definitely did not live up to expectations."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I went with a Groupon (so, low expectations).  It was $20 for $40 and I thought it was still way overpriced.  The food lacked depth of flavor.  I got drunken noodles, which just tasted like smoke.  There were huge chunks of onion and pepper, with mini shrimp (for $18).  This place needs to focus on quality ingredients over quantity (or start charging about $7/dish).  The pork dumplings were okay, but dry and a bit bland.  It was completely dead on a Saturday night--the reasons were transparent to me.  The ONLY redeeming quality of Pan was the service.  The host was friendly and warm, and the waiter was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations, and I thought the food was just ok.  I had the shrimp mango salad...again, just ok.  Could have used more cashews...maybe I should had ordered with more spice.   I tried my friends pad thai...again, just ok.  Ill probably not be back, only because I have other thai restaurants I enjoy better."}
{"text":"The massaman curry (with coconut milk) was awesome and good service. Make sure you specify your spice levels right while placing your order."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff, giant portions, delicious food, good prices. The massaman curry and clear noodles were both fantastic.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great small asian (fusion?) place off the strip.  Don't let the \"strip mall\" location or paper menus fool you, this place serves quality Asian food for half the price (or more) that's on par with a fancy Strip or Summerlin location.  I see a lot of other reviews mention the spiciness, but David does a good job of mentioning the spiciness of each dish before you put in your order.  Guess he's paying attention to these reviews.  Pad Thai:  Good, not too greasy like other restaurants.  Massaman Curry:  I've never tried this type of curry before but as an Avocado fan, it was great to have avocado in my curry.  My mom normally doesn't like curry but she liked this one.  My favorite dish of the night.  Drunken Noodles:  I've never had drunken noodles before but this was pretty good too.  Looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  The owners are so kind, and the food is so delicious.  My favorite dishes that I've had had so far are the scallop amok, pad thai, and panang curry.  I can't wait to go back to try some new dishes and say hi to the owners."}
{"text":"A little apprehensive at first as we were the only customers, but we had good service and food was quick. The Viet egg rolls were the only disappointment. We had soup and salad that were great and Pad Thai was so good, not sweat like most places. All the dishes were spiced so good. We were still hungry and since one of us could not eat Wheat it took a while to explain we did not want soy sauce but they made the fried rice, without soy, fresh for us and it was killer. The bill was $12 for each w/o drinks and we were all full. I would of given a five except for the egg rolls. We will go back. PS the soup with coconut milk was amazing for like $4:50 and we all had a cup."}
{"text":"TIP: Skip the appetizers - Small amount for the price. We had the fried spring rolls.  We had the Beef Pho and Beef Pad Thai. Both were freshly made, great taste, and good presentation.  Service was good, but nothing exceptional.  Price is good for the main entrees.  I only gave it three stars as the their spiciness scale is crazy! We love spicy food and normally order closer to a 7 or 8 on the 1-10 spicy scale. We got a 4 on the Pho and a 6 on the pad thai and both us could not handle that spiciness. A little fair warning would have been nice.   The restaurant is on the small side, but is comfortable and clean.   We will be back, but will order something less spicy and will try some of their more authentic dishes."}
{"text":"I'm wary of Yelp recommendations, as I've been led to some seriously mediocre food and non-existent places based on rave reviews from either fake, paid, or foolish people. I decided to give this place a shot anyway; it was the most pleasant dining experience I've had in years. I had a truly outstanding Masaman curry, and there was a great mix of casual and fine dining atmospheres. I suspect this place will grow quickly and lose the affordable, sincere charm like some other Thai places I used to love (Hi, Archi's!), but I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts."}
{"text":"Pan Asian has the BEST Drunken Noodles dish I've ever had. It's always good food, however if ordering through Grubhub or other food delivery service, my order gets messed up. It's best to go to the restaurant and order to go or enjoy the casual, comfortable setting."}
{"text":"First time client. Hands down some of the best Thai food in Vegas @DavidWong is the man! Definitely will be recommending this location"}
{"text":"Good family owned restaurant.  They really care about serving their customers!  Definitely try the Pineapple Fried Rice"}
{"text":"There are few restaurants that we will shamelessly frequent two days in a row. Pan Asian is one of them.  Seating is limited, food is delicious. So far we have tried the roti, massaman curry, crying tiger salad, pork/fishball soup, beef noodle soup, and drunken noodles.  The massaman curry is a must for curry-lovers. It's on a whole other spectrum of curries. Sweet and spicy; the vegetables are super fresh.   The beef noodle soup, their version of pho, had a wonderful broth. It has an added flavor that we just couldn't put our finger on...  The beef salad was THE best we have ever had. Less salty and more tender than our usual thai orders.  The service is wonderful, David and Lisa are very hospitable and make you feel at home :)"}
{"text":"after reading so many great reviews, i decided to give Pan Asian a try... and im sooo glad i did.  i ordered the green curry, and the pad thai... and they were both amazing! the flavors were spot on! and i wanted to scarf it all up, but it was a lot of food!  was happy to meet lisa who was very friendly, and made me feel welcomed. barbara the hostess/server was also very friendly. we chatted while my order was being cooked up. Learned that they used a lot of fresh organic ingredients, chicken, veggies, and dairy...which is a good thing!  i will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've tried calling for three days to make a reservation to use a Groupon and no answer; left a voicemail, no answer; messaged them through yelp, no answer."}
{"text":"Was unconvinced of high ratings (I tend to lower Vegas-based spots by a point), but not so here - good menu, and several dishes well executed.."}
{"text":"This small restaurant seems to make its dishes with love. Every dish we ordered tasted fresh and delicious, but portions were a bit small for the price...especially the curries.  My friend and I barely satisfied our hunger in spite of ordering 3 dishes between us to share.  However, the flavor and pleasant atmosphere was such that I will return in the future."}
{"text":"The food is great. I recommend the pad thai. The one thing i didn't like was the kitchen set up but then again the restaurant is fairly new."}
{"text":"Pad See Yew is the best!! The pineapple fried rice is amazing too.  If your nice David might even bring over some Johnnie Walker!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! I've had the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai. They were both fantastic, possibly (most likely) even the best I've had. Keep in mind that they do serve their food hotter than most places, so when they ask for your preferred spice level, I would go down 1 or 2 numbers."}
{"text":"It may seem like a broken record after seeing all the other reviews, but they got it right on the head! Excellent food, unbelievable service, very fair pricing... 5.95 for Filet Mignon Pho? Really? Stop reading and just go!"}
{"text":"Delicious, Fast, Friendly, Quaint, Fair Priced. Everything you want in a low-key neighborhood eatery. More lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Not a bad meal, but not fantastic. Dragon roll made with imitation crab meat instead of shrimp tempura, eel not crispy. Flavors & presentation fine. Lemongrass monitor a little sweet, but interesting. Would do Penn Ave. Fish Market first"}
{"text":"2 bad experiences here but most recently I ordered for delivery, food was supposed to be delivered at 8:11pm, an hour after the scheduled delivery time its not here. I called eat24 they called the restaurant and the owner answered. He says he doesn't know where the food is, the deliver guy left already and he tells the eat 24 rep she needs to call the restaurants 3rd party delivery guy. They were absolutely no help and hung up on the eat 24 rep. The delivery guy never answers the phone and my food never gets delivered. No customer service from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. I use to live near Pan Asian and would drive past it all the time, but I never knew it existed until I found it here on Yelp! The restaurant itself is pretty small, there are mostly 2 seat-tables and a few 4 seat-tables, probably enough to fit 20 people in total. When I came in for dinner, there were only 2 or 3 other tables occupied.   Looking at the menu, most of the dishes are Thai, with a few Chinese and Vietnamese twists here and there. I ordered the Stir-Fry Linguine with chicken and my friend ordered the Pad Thai with chicken. At other Thai restaurants I would usually request a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the spice level for my food, but the owner told me that their level 5 spice was the equivalent of 7 or 8 at other places, so I ordered a 4. Thank god I did because my linguine came out to be quite spicy! There was an abundance of chicken meat, peppers, and asparagus in my dish, and the flavor was great without being overbearing. I had a taste of my friend's Pad Thai and it was also tasty, but because my friend didn't add any spice to it, I didn't enjoy it as much as my linguine.   Service was great, the owner was very attentive to each customer's needs and our drinks were constantly being refilled. Prices are very reasonable and there are lunch specials. The next time I come here I plan to tackle their curries!"}
{"text":"This takeout place is one of the best I've ever seen. This is the only Asian restaurant my family can all agree on, any other Asain food restaurant, at least one family member will say no. This place has very fresh ingredients and you can even taste it. My favorite thing on the menu would have to be the Wong ton soup, excellent flavor, the only thing I appreciate more is if they put more of the Wong ton in it. Would keep going back for more and more"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go to Tamari and wanted to see what the new place was like. We were skeptical. We had a great experience at the bar starting with the bartender making an off menu martini that my wife loved - vodka,  lemongrass syrup, chili pepper syrup and pineapple juice. We then had a sushi we enjoyed along with a green curry that was spicy and really great.  The owner or manger suggested a Rosemary pear saki tini. We had to have it. He then gave us a free dessert that was insane, a green macha cheesecake.  It feels like they are trying to establish themselves and working hard at it. We sat right down. I'd take advantage of it before it starts getting crazy busy."}
{"text":"Great food, one of the better Thai places in town.  The portions are just a tad small, but the food is quite good.  I stick with Pad Se Ew and Pad Thai and can vouch for those dishes.  David's curry is good as well.  Support this place, worth having in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our second time to Pan. The sushi is the best I have ever had--fresh and wonderful flavor combinations. We loved the lobster and green rolls. The bowls are unique twists on Asian cuisine. Today we stopped in for Sunday brunch and Pan's take on eggs Benedict and hash were phenomenal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai restaurant in Las Vegas! The staff is always very friendly, wether we order take away or dine in. I usually order the coconut soup, Drunken noodles or the Singapore noodles. Also love the spice! Their thai tea is also delicious."}
{"text":"We have had a few meals here and all have been really good. The ingredients are fresh. The menu offers a good variety of dishes. The restaurant is small, cute and clean. I really like the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Just realized this new joint was near my office.  Had to take a look in and have a taste of the Pan Asian cuisine.  The restaurant itself is small but the menu is quite extensive.  I noticed everything on the menu from Pho to Singapore noodles.  I ordered the lunch special chicken Pad Thai and was not disappointed in the least.  Great flavors and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   If you're looking for a no frills Asian lunch/dinner, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"I wanna start out by saying that this review is based on food delivered to my home.My husband ordered the Musamun curry and pineapple fried rice and did not eat the food.  first of all everyone knows take out food pales in comparison to eating in the restaurant,so that is why I will give two stars instead of one.  The  rice was dark and unappetizing with bland and unpleasant taste and very dry. The curry was huge vegetables just rough cut and chicken was over cooked & dry.  All in all it was uneatable  Sorry,  my husband and I  know Thai food and this was A disappointment."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  Food is good quality.  Came here for the Hainam Chicken.  Closest thing to it in Vegas as I'm spoiled with this dish in California."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant!!! Very urban and hip atmosphere and best bit is that you can watch them make your food. I got the kale salad and the Pan See Ew. The food was amazing. Very flavorful and I was pleasantly surprised by how large a portion I got for such a decent price!! Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for good food and a good place to bring friends, intimate lovers, and others:) service was great too-very friendly. Highly recommended and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Call me addicted, but I visit Pan Asian at least once a week.  I can't say that I have been to any other Asian restaurant that consistently tastes as bright and fresh as the food prepared here. I love spicy food - but I have to say, this place knows how to add some heat. I can easily eat a level 9/10 at other establishments, but here, I can only tollerate levels 3 to 5 depending on the style of dish.   Top picks:  Crying Tiger Salad w/ Beef - I would order this at a lower heat level than you would traditionally order, since the acid in the salad amplifies the spice level.   DW Fried Rice - It's the best I've ever had - and if you're not adventurous, this is a great first dish for you.   Massaman or Red Curry - BOTH are perfection. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and if you like heat, add it here.  Drunken Noodles - I have yet to find a better pad kee mao in town. Delicious!  For dessert, you'll have to order the mango w/ sticky rice, or the fried bananas. Both dishes are only offered when the produce is perfectly ripe and in season. If it's not - they won't serve it!   David and his wife are absolutely wonderful, and always greet us when we come in.  Prices are right on point and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Went at opening on Sunday and was the first one there. Great easy location with plenty of parking. Friendly greeting and exceptionally nice staff. Iced tea and Gyoza to start. They were light and hot. Very tasty. Next  came the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad. Enough for three to four people and super delicious. The lime dressing was outstanding. FRESH and lovely with mint and ripe mango. Massaman curry with chicken and basmati rice. It was mild and I wish that I had asked for it hotter. All in all a delightful meal and plenty of left overs for a couple days. Will definitely go back. Looking forward to their Pad Thai and Filet Mignon PHO. When I left the restaurant was filling up with an Asian clientele. Always a good sign!"}
{"text":"The service is bad. The waitress had the worst attitude towards my family and kept giving us looks. The food is okay. The calamari breading was falling apart and the wonton soup didn't have much flavor. She asked how spicy we wanted our food from a 1-10 scale saying 5 was hot. Later she told us a 5 here is a 7 or 8 anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to many Tai places in Vegas and none of them compare to Pan Asian. I absolutely love the unique twist on the Pad Tai they offer here. Now when I have it anywhere else it just does not live up to theirs. This includes Lotus of Siam. I go here often and will continue to do so. The service is fantastic and the owners treat their customers well."}
{"text":"Amazing food my date and I ate here and enjoyed our meals thoroughly. I had the masaman curry and she had the Thai basil sauce both delicious. We will definitely have to come here again and try other items."}
{"text":"We returned to Pan Asian this afternoon, which prompted me to update my review.  Went with the Linguine again (level 4 spicy), and it was absolute perfection.  Based on other reviews and despite not being big curry fans, we went with the Massaman Curry with Chicken, and it was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  Tried the fried cheesecake for dessert, which was significantly better than the fried ice cream.  The Thai Iced Tea and Coffee were also superb.  Service was exceptional and pleasant again.  One of our favorite Thai restaurants for sure, and a definite stop during future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I usually ordered take out, the chinese waitress is not clean. She can speak English but little hard, served very slow, also another assistant who helps the main chef , she does not tie her hair also not uniform dress up !"}
{"text":"Loved the red snapper, the duck with its assorted sauces, the tilapia, the mamasan curry and the pad thai.  The owner is hilarious and his \"microwave\" is a great chef."}
{"text":"OMG!  Definately eat here!  I ordered a delivery from EAT24.com , was a little put off by the delivery charge($5.99) but you can always find coupons for money off online so i used one of them and pretty much got it delivered for free. Anyway, the food arrived, still hot in temperature, I ordered the Chicken Tom Khar soup (5 spicy) and the basil sauce with beef (5 spicy) and it was AMAZING! The best asian food ive had in vegas. The soup was perfect, the right amount for one person and the right amount of spiciness. The basil beef was amazing. The quality of the beef is superb,no fat at all and amazing taste and spicyness just right. 100% recommend this place and probably, will not eat asian food from anywhere else from now on.  For the quality of food, id even say the delivery charge is feasable."}
{"text":"The food was just excellent. First the roti appetizer was excellent, basically fried bread with curry sauce. The chicken satay was also very good, meat was moist and had the best peanut sauce I've tasted so far. Most peanut sauce  I have tasted is usually overpowering with flavor, this sauce was just well blended and flavorful. The Crying Tiger salad was different in a good way, spicy and the dressing had just the right amount of sourness. The Duck curry of course was  our favorite. The meat perfectly moist inside and just crisped right outside. The curry was just a perfect balance with the duck and brought out the flavor from the meat, plus I never thought the grapes in the dish would work but it did. Lastly the fried ice cream was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner. Lisa the cook is absolutely amazing. Doreen our server was very friendly and informative about our menu selections. David the owner was funny also and kind of kept the place together. The atmosphere was very friendly and casual. Everybody in Las Vegas and out of towners should try this place"}
{"text":"This place is very solid.  David does like to make it spicy though, so dial down your number.  I am usually a solid 5 at most thai, but here i am a 2 or 3.  My go to for asian."}
{"text":"Scrumptious. Seriously, it's yummy. The kitchen can get a little backed up, but it is worth the wait. We started with vietnamese ravioli. The tender wontons are stuffed with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, celery and served with a sesame sauce. After devouring those we couldn't wait to dig in to our entrees. I had the drunken noodles. I like spicy and ordered a 6, after the owner warned an 8 was too hot. They don't mess around with spice here. I like that. Flat noodles, tossed with a perfect blend of seasoning, tomatoes and green beans. My husband must try the sweet and sour chicken at every new place we try. This version was a bit lighter than the usual, no thick breading, just chicken stir fried with pineapple, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes and cucumber. I am anxious to return and start eating my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Tried PAN with my husband with a Groupon.  I guess their happy hour is half price all drinks (which Tamari also had), which is a great price and they had just as unique of cocktail offerings as Tamari did.  So, 5 starts for happy hour.  However, we were pretty disappointed in the food, even at the Groupon price.  We ordered the Korean Fried Chicken, Cheek Bowl, and the Hanger Stir Fry. We both enjoyed the Korean Fried Chicken, it was perfectly fried, juicy, and the wasabi slaw was a nice compliment.  However, the other 2 dishes were extremely salty, doused in soy sauce, and seemed very oily.  Seem like \"cheap chinese food\" at a not cheap price.  Neither of us eat sushi so I can't comment on that...so we'll stick to this place for drinks only."}
{"text":"Such high ratings so I order take out and was underwhelming to say the least. Small portions and not that tasty honestly. Ive eaten Chinese and Thai food all over the world and would say you neighborhood Chinese or Thai take out place would be a better choice... I really wanted to like this place.."}
{"text":"So this place has been open for a while, but I just recently discovered it. It was very delicious! David Wong is the owner of this place and he has done an amazing job. The interior design of the restaurant is very nice and the menu is very large with lots of options. The Malaysian Roti was made to the right texture and it was super delicious. The Chicken Satay was so moist and perfect! The Mango Salad is the best here, they are not stingy. The Filet Mignon Noodle Soup was really good because the meat was very soft. The Pad Thai was not my favorite though, I was actually disappointed, it's not bad, but it didn't stand out to me. Lastly we had Fried Banana w/ Ice Cream, and I didn't like it because there was coconut flakes in it and they use plantains and so it wasn't very tasty, I like it sweeter. But it was okay because David gave me extra fried banana because he said I was too skinny, haha! Overall, this place is a really good thai restaurant. I wonder why not that many people know about it. I will be coming back often:)"}
{"text":"Delish , was so good ! Always enjoy what ever new dish  I try here David and Lisa are both amazing as is the staff."}
{"text":"Very good Pho! It's a different twist on the broth. Full of spices and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the rating. My food was not hot at all. I had barely any meat in my soup and all my crispy shrimp egg rolls were burnt at the ends. I won't order here again."}
{"text":"First off let me say two things. Some of the pictures posted are old so it may not reflect the prices accurately or the portion of soup you'll get. Secondly I was in the mood for soup so there are two locations you can find them on the menu. I was told the ones under the Soup are \"appetizer\" size and the ones listed under Noodle and Rice are considered the large portions.  I decided to get the pork rice noodle soup and if you like pho and if you like garlic then you'll love the rice noodle soup they have. Broth was full of flavor, taste like it had fish sauce in it already. The roasted garlic complimented the ground pork and fish ball, yummy. My only complaints are that the sprouts were already in the soup when they served it, which made them partially cooked and less crispy and also, I found a lot of garlic skins in soup which I had no intention of eating.  Overall I was very happy with the meal for the price. It's a unique soup and I will come back to have more."}
{"text":"I was a little wary about trying this place because the reviews here seemed streaky - a run of good reviews and then a run of bad.  I've tried take out here before - chinese food - but wasn't all that impressed. Went back to dine in tonight and strictly ordered Thai food. Much better than initial impressions.  Service was a little spotty. We didn't have all our place settings and they seemed to always forget about my little guy. Just because he sits in a high chair doesn't mean he doesn't drink water or need a plate for his food. Other than the occasional reminders, waitress was attentive and owners filled in when necessary.  Ordered the massaman curry, shrimp mango salad, pineapple fried rice, spring rolls, chicken pad thai, and satay - all without any spice due to the kids' sensitive and picky palates.  Every dish was excellent and tasty. The salad had a tad too much fish sauce for my liking but I think all Thai salads have too much fish sauce.  This was a lot of food for our family of five but I happily took home leftovers.  Not sure I would eat some of the Chinese food on the menu again, but I am definitely coming back for Thai."}
{"text":"Man I really wanted to like this place. It was an anniversary night out. The day was hot but the night was fairly cool with low humidity. We had reservations on the deck on a Saturday night. The view was beautiful the ambience was fantastic!  Unfortunately that's where the good review ends.   We were seated and ordered dirty vodka martinis. My wife's water glass had a crack in it and some sort of unidentified food stuck on it. We sent the water back. The waiter informed is that they were out of olive juice. Then informed they were out of sake. ALL sake. Like all of it. On a Saturday night. Anyway we ordered two other speciality cocktails that were above average.   The sushi roll we ordered was very good. Their take on Asian poutine was also very good. Our meals came immediately after we got our apps. We saw the waiter sit them on a table inside through the window to kind of pretend that they hadn't arrived yet. Then brought them out 5 minutes later.   The place was completely empty on a beautiful Saturday night. That should have been our warning. All in all it seems that by this display the ownership already knows that they are going to fold and have begun cutting staff and skimping on stocking the restaurant. Too bad the location is awesome. Can't wait to see what is put in this spot as soon as it closes. Which clearly will be soon."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Thai food I've ever had in my life. All the years I spent in LA, I've tried tons of Thai places and none come anywhere close to David Wong's Pan Asain. I pray to God that they open more locations so I can enjoy this greatness throughout the remaining years of my life no matter where I go.   Top 2 Favies;  1. Pad Thai level 5 (don't kid yourself anything hotter than 5 will be painful)  2. DW Fried Rice Level 4 (not as hot so you can taste all the bursting flavors of deliciousness)"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best Thai food I've ever eaten.  I'm from North Dakota, so I don't have many options...but still.  I dated a girl from Thailand many years ago, so I've tried my share of the cuisine.  And this place is solid.  Everything I've tried here has been outstanding.  Pleasant presentation, complex flavors.  The owners are very kind and take great care in making sure the customer has a good experience.  One last thing:  be careful with the spice levels.  I had to convince Mr. Wong into letting me have the panang curry at level 5.  It was probably the equivalent of a 7 or 8 at other places in town.  My parents had take out recently and ordered at level 7 - that couldn't have gone well!  :)  Stop by if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! I ordered the pad thai and had it made extra spicy. The restaurant is family owned, and they are very nice. They came a couple times and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything.  A+ for the service, A+ for the food. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite neighborhood spot. We took yelper's recommendations and tried the chicken ravioli - excellent. Light, good flavors and unique. The black bean chicken, massamam curry and basil chicken have all been top notch. Love the fact that everything is made fresh.   The 2nd time we came in we felt lke regulars, David, Lisa and Barbara all make you feel welcome. If you are on the west side/Summerlin area this is a must - if you aren't over there, make the trip it's worth it."}
{"text":"Apparently hoping for a server with either no attitude or all their teeth is a tall order. The sushi and noodles were just OK. If you were a fan of Mike Chen's TAMARI then you will be a bit disappointed in the food here. Unfortunately Andora is known for employing less than average people to bring you food. Their Fox Chapel location employees a man who was convicted of child pornography. Our server (Laura?) informed us of that fact - after she got angry that we compared it Tamari. Calm down pumpkin, people are going to make those generalizations and you need to keep your shitty attitude to about a one about it. I also don't want my server to tell me how to eat. No, I don't care if your \"don't course out\" the meals. You will take my order and bring me my food - that is the level of our transaction. I also don't want her to HOVER every five seconds. I get that many people in the service industry suffer from addiction and she was showing classic signs of being addicted to us. Like if  she left our table she had separation anxiety. My boyfriend and his sister weren't fans either. Our drinks took forever to arrive, the bar wasn't even busy so I'm guessing the blond woman was a newbie. At any rate I'll be avoiding this place solely on the poor service and slow service. My boyfriend lives in Upper Lawrenceville and we had high hopes. But our visit last week proved it to be a dud."}
{"text":"Had the tiger shrimp mango salad and the filet mignon pho!!! Both very very tasty and packed with flavor but Be careful of the spicyness level. I ordered level 3, thinking i could handle it but my mouth was on fire!! Regardless, it was delicious and I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai place in Las Vegas! Pad Thai is amazing!"}
{"text":"We shared the chicken wonton soup. I had cashew chicken, my husband had a noodle dish both were delicious. We ended with the fried ice cream! Great food, great price! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!!!!!!!  Best Thai I've ever eaten!  A must visit in Las Vegas if you enjoy Thai food!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed... This was my absolute favorite place for pad thai in Vegas. Went for lunch today, got my usual and BAM! it was HORRIBLE! Tasted slimy and fishy... I sent it back nicely and told him that his pad thai is my absolute favorite and today it just isnt right... Well, he started talking to the cook and she got mad, said she didnt put fish sauce in it and that something is wrong with me because they make it the same way everytime. Ok. Then Mr Wong, takes it in the back and tastes it and proceeds to tell me that it must be me because it tastes fine and that maybe it was just too spicy for me. I have eaten the pad thai here over a dozen times now - I order it the same exact way everytime. So much for awesome customer service... I wont be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I think I just found my favorite Asian restaurant, EVER!!!  Anyone that gives this place less than a 4 stars should not be able to be a critic!    After a whole day of shopping with a friend of mine, I choose the restaurant for dinner and loved everything I ate (granted it was only two dishes).  I ordered a chicken garlic pepper and my friend ordered a chicken red curry.  They asked both of us what level of spice we wanted and they made the spice to the tee!  Her's was a 6-7 and mine was a 3...It reminds me of my parents restaurant they used to own in Dallas, very personable, small and friendly!  It was the mom, dad and daughter!  The favors were very unique, unlike most Asian restaurants I have been too, where they just sloop on soy sauce and call it Szechuan sauce, black bean sauce or garlic sauce...everything had a very distinct favor to it!  Which made the meal even more savoring and worth going back again and again to try all the dishes.   I loved the food we had that I ordered a red curry with chicken to take home.  The only thing that was a bit difficult was the place was a bit hard to find.  But I know where it is located now so I don't think it will be a problem.    Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Finally, we found a place on our side of town with delicious, fresh Thai food.  They have recently renovated the dining room to make it cozy and modern as well.  You get the feeling that this is a family run business and as a bonus, everyone speaks English. My favorite is the stir-fry linguine and he loves the Pad Kee Mow.  We are both so happy that we don't have to go downtown and deal with the crowds at Le Thai anymore.  Pan Asian is just as good---delicious--and far less expensive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, this is my second time here, and it rocked it again! I ordered the roti and again it was the best I have ever had, also had the chicken raviolli and it was fresh and tasty. Now Lisa made something off the menu for us, called pad cha, it was so bold in flavor, with spice and fresh vegitables and chicken making a beautiful melody together. I also had the crying tiger, at Misti's suggestion, and it was HUGE in flavor and light. Big flavors meshing together, fresh ingredients, excellent service, clean, and innovative. The best!"}
{"text":"This takeout is so yummy! The Tom Yum soup, panang curry, basil stir fry, are so good! And when they say they offer \"extra spicy\", they mean it. Even the won ton soup is good and we all know of a lot of places that don't bother to do this world famous soup justice. Funny thing is , I have never actually stepped foot in the restaurant. This place is definitely my takeout comfort food place ! :) One day I will make it to the actual place. And remember always tip the delivery driver :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, we were there on Saturday afternoon.  We had the drunken noodles, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best thai restsurant in town. Drunken noodle, man i can eat that dish everyday. The curries are really good also."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were pleasantly surprised! Every dish we ordered was so tasty and flavorful! ....volcano chicken, Singapore noodles with beef, drunken noodles and fried rice. Then tempura cheesecake YUM!!   Our new favorite Asian restaurant! Great service as well. We are impressed!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten here... but I do remember the tiger shrimp mango salad. It was delectable! Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"We ate a delicious meal at Pan tonight for our anniversary. We shared the tempura shrimp, a watercress salad with mango, cucumber and avocado, sablefish with pickled mustard greens and shaved pork cheeks with bok choy & more. Would like to return and try more of the selections. Our server Jordan was very attentive and helpful. Enjoyed eating outside and hearing the two fountains. Bravo!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Everything is SO yummy!!! Full of flavor. Meat is tender. Fresh & authentic. Lovely family owned. Everyone is so nice. Beautiful decorations & cute date spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town.  They've got fantastic Massaman curry and their Drunken Noodles are also superb.  I like their lunch specials they offer. Whenever I get the chance to go there, it's always a highlight of my day.  I highly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely LOVE Pan Asian!!! I have never heard of this place until I received an email from Yelp recommending this place. Honestly it was the other reviewers pic and comments that enticed me to go and try. I was looking forward to seeing/meeting the owner David because of all the compliments of how nice and hospitable he was.   We went in on a Saturday around lunch time and there was another couple in there. I was surprised and a little excited to see that David was in fact there.  He seemed very polite, there was any unnecessary hostess or waiters, just him.  Which I liked. I had my two children with me, one in which is a 3 year old and David paid extra special attention to them.   Another great observation was that it had an open kitchen as to where you are able to see what and who was cooking the meal. A real plus for me because I like to see the cleanliness of the kitchen.   Everything I ordered was purely based on yummy pics of precious yelpers. This was what we ordered:  Appetizers: chicken satay and Vietnamese ravioli  Entrees: XO pork spareribs, pad seeyew with chicken, and the DW fried rice  Dessert: deep fried cheesecake  We loved everything except the ravioli. Prices weren't too bad.  My fave part was when David came over and asked my kids if they wanted ice cream and of course they said yes. It was complimentary of course. And I loved that. The cheesecake was heavenly!!!! The fried rice was the tastiest ever!!!! We shall be back soon!!! Go and try it!  Ps-I ordered a Thai coffee and It was THE BEST everrrrrrrr!!!!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic family-owned Thai restaurant. Panang Curry and Pad Thai were great. Really fresh ingredients. Tom Yum and Tom Ka were fantastic as well.  Would definitely stop in next time I'm on the west side of town."}
{"text":"This is a Lawrenceville gem.  Not too many people seem to know about it..... yet....  The food is amazing.  Chef Josh prepares not only delicious food, but it's beautifully presented!!  The food presentation looks like something you would have in New York City, and so yummy!  Ahi tuna Poke is hard to come by in Pittsburgh... but they have it pretty close.  It is served on top of wonton chips and it's delicious!  The \"KFC\" bowl is amazing and the kale and brussel salad is also good.  A must try if you are looking for something different.  Great patio and upper balcony, and funky vibe inside.  Nice to just sit at the bar and have a cocktail with bartender Amy, who never disapoints crafting something new!"}
{"text":"I've dined in few times in the past and really enjoyed the food, so I was excited to see that they now offer delivery through Yelp's Eat24. Delivery time was 45-60 minutes; however, shortly after submitting my order I received a notification that they were ahead of schedule - Yay, bonus!   Well... that turned out to be too good to be true. 1 hour after I submitted my order, I decided I better contact the restaurant. I called 3 times - no answer. Finally I used the Eat24 message feature to check on the status. Ryan was very helpful! He was able to contact the restaurant and get an update. He removed the tip (because the restaurant certainly didn't deserve one,) and he credited my order. My food was delivered shortly thereafter.  Pan Asian service - 0 stars Eat24 service - 5 stars  The food... I ordered the Filet Mignon Pho and the Black Bean Tofu Stir Fry, both of which were soooooo spicy you couldn't taste anything. My mouth is still burning. The stir fry was very generous in terms of portion, but the pho's noodle to soup ratio was way off - more soup please! Food - 2 stars  Kinda bummed, I used to really like this place. This experience was two thumbs DOWN!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food as always.. husband and wife work the kitchen together.  They're amazing and very accommodating.  Wife read our palms tonight. I don't believe in that, but it was very cool of her to come out of the kitchen. By the way, food is awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Small menu but enough choices for everyone. Food is very fresh and really tasty. Pad Thai was excellent and so was the pineapple fried rice with curry seasoning.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Move over Lotus of Siam, there's a new kid in town! I was introduced to this place by one of my favorite bloggers, Wendy C. of  http://wendyfulworld.com/    She was on the money! David Wong's is now my go-to Thai in Las Vegas. His signature dishes, the Shrimp Mango Salad and Crispy Duck in Red Curry, are out of this world! The Pad See Yew and Pineapple Fried Rice are also authentic and tasty. They have a numbering system of 1 to 10, but beware, 5 is incredibly spicy!  The bonus is you can bring your own wine or beer here, no corkage. I wanted to try their Mango with Sticky Rice but they were out. We ordered Fried Banana instead, but that was a disappointment. Guess we'll just have to come back for the Mango with Sticky Rice!"}
{"text":"Yelpers you got this one wrong : (  We got take out after we read all the great yelp reviews.  We were pretty disappointed, the Tom khar soup  lacked flavor and had a strange after taste, the Thai beef salad was greasy and had many fatty pieces and the massman curry was very runny. We will stick Panna Thai."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short. I love Thai food and this is by far the best Thai I have ever had anywhere. My wife is a military brat who lived in Thailand for about four years. She thinks this is the real deal as well. Lastly, all the nice things said about the owners are true. Great people and great Thai food! I wish I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"We are Vegan so we tried to ordered Street Noodles and vegetables no Chicken or Shrimp that comes with it. The expensive part to the dish. We asked the waiter if there was a different price as we were leaving off the meats. He said he thought there would be as they charge to add more meat. The manager said no.  Sorry I am not paying $14 for Noodles that cost them $1.00.  So I ordered Curry Vegetables instead. It was the waterest sauce I have ever seen or tasted. I love going to PF Chang's but, this will not be a location that I go back to. The manager didn't even come over to say they were sorry when I told the waiter about how bad the sauce was. The only thing good about this was the waiter."}
{"text":"Saw great Yelp reviews and decided to try. I admit that being a chef I am easily pleased by effort. We ordered tapas style. Sampling different stuff.   The waitress was merely an order taker and recommended everything on the menu..... So we ordered Malaysian Roti along with deep fried egg rolls. We told her that we were sampling and wanted to stay away from deep fried.  The Malaysian Roti we ordered was deep fried , dripping with oil not even close to the recipe of Malaysian Roti.A Shocker.   I suggested that the chef put on menu that it is a deep fried dish. The waitress smiled but did not like my suggestion and never came back.  Food: Average at best. I have had much much better. Service: Poor.   Having said that, I think David's heart is at the right place. A few little changes and things would be better. Cheers and am rooting for you."}
{"text":"Vegas has many Thai restaurants to choose from, but this one stands out solely based on Chef David Wong, he greets all his guests and makes sure everything is to your liking. The food is great and very reasonably priced, main entrees anywhere from $9 to $14 dollars. The quality and freshness are superb. I got the Pad see-ew at a level 7 spice (1-10 spice levels) it was hot and delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"The owner David is very nice and after coming here for several months now I decided i had to give some credit. All of the food seems really fresh and unique. We usually order chicken pad Thai and pad see-yew? David's restaurant is always very clean, the food us delicious, and since its a small restaurant he learns his customers very quickly. Best Thai tea ever!"}
{"text":"I had PHO, it is consistently the best I've ever had.  Very friendly, and attentive service.  GREAT!!"}
{"text":"really good hainan chicken. solid pho (that's more like a thai-style bun bo hue)"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles here are the best I have ever had. Papaya salad is great too! There is no place in town with better Drunken noodles. Service is great and DAVID is usually in the kitchen cooking. Food comes out piping hot just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Update. Thai places always go downhill and pan Asian is no different. Delivery took 45 min longer than expected and we tried new things none of them were that great. Stick with the classics here.   New fav Thai place! Actually flavorful food! I'm a vegetarian and it's still delicious. And it's great as left overs. Doesn't get dry like a lot of other places. Don't love that sometimes it's a bit oily but very good spicy Thai food!!"}
{"text":"This is a totally worthwhile off the strip culinary adventure. If you head towards China town on Spring Mountain Road and keep driving for about ten minutes pass an abundance of Foot Spas you will arrive at Durango Dr. Turn right and you will see the restaurant right next to Storage One on the right hand side.  Now, when you get there, be prepared to be greeted warmly by Mr. David Wong himself, a friendly and genuine personality that made us feel right at home. The menu is simple yet has a lot of exciting varieties but after three incredibly satisfying visits, here are my top recommendations:  1) Mango or green papaya salad - oh so refreshing and delicious! 2) MUST HAVE red duck curry (It's off the menu and their top secret special!, Lisa Wong, the chef pours her heart into this dish!) 3) Yellow Malaysian tilapia curry. 4) Garlic sauce tofu 5) Basil chicken  The servings are generous, prices are reasonable and service is friendly and fast. What more could one ask for? Their ingredients are of superior quality and food presentation is of what you expect of a fine dining restaurant.   We had the tempura cheesecake and it was the the icing on the cake of our culinary experience. This is a MUST VISIT every time we come to Vegas! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night based on the reviews.  People spicy does not mean good! We started with Tom Khar soup.  It was awful.  I don't think they had any prepared and threw it together because the ingredients were under cooked. We ordered Basil Sauce stir fry with shrimp, Pad Si Ew and Pad Thai. The Pad Si Ew was the best dish, well flavored.  The vegetables in the stir fry were not great and neither was the shrimp, green beans were tough and under cooked.  The Pad Thai tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce over noodles and the noodles were over cooked.  Pretty disappointing.  I will go back to Archi's for Thai."}
{"text":"The food is great, portions are big and prices are good.  The owner is awesome, recognizes his customers and he is a great chef. They're always very nice when you call, pick up or eat there.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because if the owner is not cooking food is not consistent. We got chicken instead of beef. Singapore noodles with burned taste. Entree without rice. Singapore noodles and cashew nuts are the best."}
{"text":"Dined here with Tom R.  Food was good, had tons of flavor. Things we had:  Malaysian Roti: Not amazingly good, but I was impressed with how it turned out especially since the person that ordered it had no idea what it was. The contrast in texture between the crispy outside and chewy inside was very enjoyable and the sauce was quite nice.  Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad: Can't say I was too fond of this one. The shrimp was still raw on the inside, though for a salad maybe that's how it's supposed to be? The main detractor for me was the copious amounts of mango on it. The mango flavor overwhelmed everything else.  Singapore Noodles: Definitely one of the best dishes we had, was well cooked and flavorful.  Garlic Beef: Advertised as \"1000 times better than broccoli beef\" by the owner himself. Granted nothing can be 1000 times better than broccoli beef, it didn't disappoint. It was heavy on the salt and pepper, probably too salty on it's own for most people's liking but not me. Fortunately it comes with a side of rice that I highly advise you use.  Pad Thai: Perhaps the most disappointing dish. Not very authentic if you ask me. It wasn't sweet enough, was PINK, and had no peanuts. Nonetheless it was still pretty tasty, though it's pretty hard to make Pad Thai not taste good. The only Pad Thai I've had and didn't like was from Buffet @Asia.  Probably the worse thing about the restaurant is the lack of staff. There's one person that stays in the kitchen and cooks, and then the other triples as a cook, server, and cashier. When my water ran out, I didn't even want to ask for a refill seeing how bad the customer:employee ratio was. Seeing how Tom knew the owners and he's a regular, I hoped we'd get some sort of a discount."}
{"text":"Wow, I have to say, seeing the reviews on yelp, I had pretty high expectations. Still exceeded. The food was just outstanding! The garlic pepper sauce was my favorite! My wife insisted the cashew sauce was better, it was very good but.. nope, she's wrong :)"}
{"text":"It wasn't that great when it was Tamari and still not great with the new name Pan.  We went with a group of 6 for restaurant week and had high hopes.  They have a great outdoor seating area and the restaurant week special was a true deal! For $20.15 you got a choice of a sushi roll appetizer and one of their many bowl entrees. As our group arrived our friendly waiter greeted us and brought out drinks. He made helpful suggestions of the popular picks including the mojito which one in our party ordered. It got an OK review. I went with my go to White Lightening in a bottle with an orange.  We all ordered the restaurant week special well except for me and I got a salad.  The salad was mediocre-a combo of mango, cucumber, avocado with weird lettuce. The appetizer sushi rolls came out next and one of our friends did not get served his until about 10 minutes after the rest of the group.  The waiter kept promising it would be out shortly and we just figured he must have gotten something that took a long time to make.  The portions of the appetizers were abundant and the presentation was perfect. Next up was the entrees. Once again all were served except our friend with the late shrimp sushi roll.  The waiter was somewhat apologetic and said it was his fault-he must have forgot his order but we were ready to get the check by the time our friend's meal came out.  The manager did stop by but wasn't that apologetic.  They all said they would take care of us which meant him getting his meal for free. This is nice and all but left a bad taste in our mouth (no pun intended) and the likelihood of going back is slim due to the terrible service. It is no fun having a guest in your party watching others eat their meal.  With that being said the entrée bowls had a lot of fresh ingredients from veggies, to noodles and many options of seafood.  Also vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Second time enjoying a meal here , the food itself is simply amazing ! I ordered the pho and the broth it comes in is by far the best I've  ever had , my boyfriend had the red curry with tofu and the spice level was perfect! The whole staff is so friendly and the owner is just as nice which is a breath of fresh air nowadays thanks for the delicious lunch you guys never disappoint !"}
{"text":"Is was a slow weekday between the lunch and dinner hours.  Honesty thought we arrived at the wrong placed based on all the awesome reviews.  After trying the food however, we were surprised to find that this is definitely the right place!  NOTE  The portions are large The portions are pretty When they say spicy, it is DEFINITELY spicy! The prices are terrific The service is friendly The parking is easy to find  What more do you need?   **Keep in mind, however, that this place aims to please all people, not just certain cultures.  In other words, there is definitely more flavor in the meals than you would expect and not as \"organic\" as one might find overseas.  Is it still tasty?  Of course, YES.**"}
{"text":"Their recent menu has been *much* better than when they first opened.   My wife and I hit up Pan at least once a month now for a late dinner.   The \"Pan Thai\" is pretty darn good - especially if you like pork belly."}
{"text":"Wow! I was intrigued by the huge number of reviews on Yelp, and the 4.5 star average at our venerable site, of Pan Asian Restaurant. Since it is just a few miles from home, we went there for my birthday dinner. The charming owner and his gorgeous wife, who does the cooking, were intent on making our visit a superb experience. They succeeded with a fresh, five-star meal served in clean and cheery surroundings. The place is intimate without being dark, a rather unique feature for Las Vegas. The ceiling is a fashionable black with light-fixtures built into it that resemble shoji screens. Being a Pan-Asian establishment, I was able to order a delightful chicken-based gyoza appetizer and one that featured beautiful, architecturally-sound chunks of deep-fried tofu that were both prepared in the most appealing ways. My husband enjoyed his chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce on the side, which I also tasted and thought were ideal. I like very hot seasoning, so I packed my own heat in the form of crushed, dried Japanese chiles, in case they did not offer my favorite condiment, Chinese-style red chile oil. I was pleasantly surprised when Mr Wong, the owner, brought a full panoply of elegantly presented hot chile condiments in a black porcelain caddy.. I didn't miss the red chile oil, as he had included sriracha, two vinegar-based red chile sauces, jalapeños and a dry Japanese pepper mix, something I use regularly at home.   My main dish was something that caught my eye because it contained beef with fresh greens of various varieties, and had the jazzy name, \"Crying Tiger.\" It was a voyage of discovery, every bite containing the various components in different amounts. Its thinly-sliced beef was exquisite; next time I shall ask it to be well-done, because it seems that the cook aims to please. In fact, as my husband pointed out, within that one dish there was something to reward any beef-aficionado, because some slices were more cooked than others. The freshness and flavors of the health-promoting were most impressive, but to describe the assemblage fully here would be to deprive other diners of their own adventures in good eating.  My husband ordered the pineapple fried rice, without the shrimp component. He was delighted that the gracious cook customized it to his taste. I had a bite, and it was uniquely delicious.  Pan Asian is a friendly, pitch-perfect place where I intend to try some of the other fresh, lovely offerings soon--pad Thai comes to mind.... After all, the place is called, \"Pan Asian Restaurant\"!"}
{"text":"I happen to come across this restaurant as I was driving down Durango.  I thought I'd decide to come in one day for lunch and so I did.  I don't know how anyone can give this place five or four stars, but I'm sorry, Pan Asian didn't do it for me.  I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai Lunch Special.  I wasn't impressed, I've had better at other Thai restaurants.  Service was a bit slow, took awhile to get my food and check.  Once I completed my meal and paid, owner asked told me...\"Thanks for coming in, see you again tomorrow.\"  I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"This place offers a great variety of Asian dishes nicely prepared and served.    I always order my favorite Pad-See-Yeew with a Thai Ice tea, but I also love their chicken panang Curry and papaya salad.  The portions are great for sharing or as your own.   The service is always great and being family owned you can tell they have pride in what comes out of their kitchen.  Also  check out their great lunch specials, and desserts."}
{"text":"Believe your fellow yelpers- this place is a foodie paradise.  Noodles and curries are good - make sure to get the Malaysian Roti - deep fried cheesecake was good- only  item that wasn't as good as the rest was the Viet chicken ravioli. We will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I have a friend who like to eat good food as much as I do.  So when he recommended Pan Asian to me I agreed to give it a try.  It is a 25 minute drive from where I live to the restaurant, I have to drive through Chinatown to get there.  Its worth the drive.   David and Lisa are husband and wife and the owners of the place.  The kitchen is open so you can see exactly what is going on.  It is very clean.  They will make you feel like family.  David makes it a point to know everyone by name and the next time you come in he will ask about the people that were there last time.  The food is top notch I have eaten at several Thai restaurants including one in town that is a favorite on the food network channel, there is nothing that is close to the quality of food that Chef Lisa prepares.  She will vary the heat according to your taste.  I like an 8 on most things, in the soup it is a slow heat that builds.  She uses fresh Thai peppers and they do not release their heat immediately, so be careful.  I normally order one of the soups to start an entree and then dessert.  The Fishball and Beef Noodle Soups are both excellent.  They are always asking us to try something new, that isn't on the menu.  The Red and Duck Curries are incredible.  Each of the ingredients maintains its individual flavor and yet they all work together.  Sometimes they have a Key Lime Pie in a small cup it is yummy.  Maybe if I mention it enough people will ask for it and they will have it all of the time.  It is the perfect compliment to the spicy food.  The Sticky Rice with Mango and sesame seeds is very nice.  There is a little bit of sea salt that accents the warm sticky rice and the ice cold mango with coconut milk. If I find something that I don't like I will let you know but so far everything that I have tried I would eat again.  it is getting tougher to get through the menu as I go back to what I have eaten before."}
{"text":"A fast, fresh, and friendly spot. The husband and wife team of David and Lisa are very friendly and talented in the kitchen. They make you feel right at home and follow through with some tasty food.  My wife and I started with the tiger shrimp and mango salad with red onion, red bell pepper, and cashews. Perfection. It was savory, sweet, and spicy--everything you could ask for.  We followed up with the chicken Panang curry with gorgeous green beans and bok choy. The ingredients weren't submerged in sauce, which as David explained, is how they do it where he is from in Thailand. Instead the dish is nicely coated with a healthy helping of curry, which wonderfully united the textures and flavors of the fresh vegetables and chicken.  For dessert, we had tempura fried ice cream. Yup, 'nuff said.  If you're after fresh and affordable food, give Pan Asian a try. I know I'll be back again and again.  Did I mention it was fresh?"}
{"text":"Truly stellar Fare. I went with the signature house fried rice and the Singapore noodles with shrimp for my first outing at David Wong's Pan Asian.  Excellent flavor, very fresh ingredients, and when they ask you if you like it spicy, they're serious. I'll be frequenting this establishment win in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was looking for other Thai restaurants in Vegas and very intrigued by the score of this restaurant.  Thought that I had to try this!  We ordered Pad Thai woon sen, which has less calories than regular noodles. Yen Tha Fo is a sour soup dish (didn't expect this dish to be really sour) and basil chicken is a perfect with rice.   I would rate 12 out of 10 for the pad thai. It was very delicious.   Definitely will go back again when we are in town!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I am always looking for quality Thai restaurants.   Recently moving to Vegas, I looked up places near where I will be living and found Pan Asian.  Great feeling when you first walk in.  Chef David greets you warmly and lets you know that your dining experience will be wonderful.    His menu had several items for non-meat eaters and the I had the Tofu Cashew.  Excellently prepared and perfectly tasty.  I will be coming back weekly!"}
{"text":"David Wongs Pan Asian is hands down one of the best new discovery of mine! First of walking into a clean mom and pop restaurant these days alone is a plus let alone being genuinely greeted by the owner and staff. Then the menu is pretty traditional except for the filet mignon pho which is delicious! Best of all the price are so cheap! Well done Mr Wong"}
{"text":"Although very out of the way for me, I happened to be in the neighborhood while going to see my hair stylist. I was a little bit early so I decided to grab a quick lunch. I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry."}
{"text":"The duck curry was fantastic, the beef salad was on the salty side, but good flavor. I would not recommend the chicken dish we had, and I don't really remember the name of it.  The service was ok. The place is small. Food was delivered slow due to limited staffs. Price is on the high side. That's about it, nothing exciting."}
{"text":"\"We're not playing around here.\"  That is what Mr. David Wong said to us as we were ordering our food (warning us to be careful on ordering spicy level).  How awesome is that?!  He warned us but we still ordered food at a varying levels from 3-7 spicy level.  All of us were completely satisfied after we scarfed everything down.  We're a bunch of pigs so we ordered the following dishes for family style sharing: 1.  Crying Tiger - This is a refreshing salad of seared beef with greens and tangy spicy dressing 2.  Malaysian Roti - Deep fried dough with lovely potato curry 3.  Basil Fried Rice - Yea!  Bring on the heat and flavor! 4.  Spicy Basil with chicken - Yummy stir fry with a bunch of different greens  5.  Black Pepper Chicken - Similar to the spicy basil stir fry but more black bean sauce. 6.  Pineapple Fried Rice - This had a very pleasant aroma of curry and pineapple. Delish! 7.  Red Snapper - Delicious seafood in a non-fancy restaurant?  It sure it.  It was deep fried with tangy sweet and sour sauce. 8.  Duck Curry - This was my fav of the night!  This duck was cooked with LOVE!  The skin was perfectly crunchy and when paired with the curry sauce, it was heaven. 9.  Tempura Icecream - Standard deep fried yumminess 10.  Tempura Cheesecake - Standard deep fried yumminess  Conclusion:  It's impressive that a restaurant can offer so many different Asian dishes and do them all so well!  Sorry Michelle's waistline, this restaurant is around the corner, so we're coming more often!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, creative dinners and small plates.  They are also gluten-free friendly, using gf soy sauce, and our waitress was extremely knowledgable. My only complaint is that it is way, way too noisy."}
{"text":"It is so far away from the strip....  Is it worth coming here, NO.  I am sure you can find comparable thai food around the strip (or at least in chinatown) or downtown.  Anyhow, the food is a little on the greasy side.  It tasted decent/good.  We love the friendliness of the owners (Lisa and David).  Most dishes were around $8 to $9 which is decent.  We came here for lunch, and there weren't that many people.  We ordered the mango salad, malaysian rotti, pad see u, and pad thai.  Our favorite was the deep fried malaysian rotti.  Food:  3.0 stars Service:  3.0 stars Owners hospitality:  5.0 stars (did not receive any complimentary desserts though)"}
{"text":"I've been treated out here twice for lunch and both were good experiences. Most of the items on the menu are Thai but I see that they also have some Chinese , Japanese and Vietnamese options available.  I have enjoyed everything that I've tried so far , especially their chicken satay and Massaman curry. I really like flat noodles so you can never go wrong with their pad see ewe or drunken noodles (aka pad kee mao) for entrees. We have also tried their red curry w/ duck (one of their daily specials). Their red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it ! I'm used to just having bell pepper and bamboo in my red curries but eggplant and pumpkin made the dish so much better. The duck was a bit more on the dry side but I think it complimented the curry.   Their spice level is from 1-10 and it's very accurate. A \"5\" is definitely mild and \"10\" must be insanely spicy since we ordered an \"8\" on our second visit and it was super spicy that we were sweating. It was a good kind of spicy though but I think if I got a \"10\" I would probably cry LOL.   Seating is alright , feels like a spot between a sit down restaurant and fast food place. I like that they maintain this place pretty clean though and they have an open kitchen. Overall , this is a great place to choose for lunch or take-out for dinner ! Don't skip on the Thai tea :9"}
{"text":"So I got a groupon for Pan. Which worked out great because I had honestly been meaning to go back there since the Yelp event. I brought along my fiance and recently married big sister (yay!).  We got veggie tempura to start, a chai cocktail, a drai laag beer, and their seasonal sangria (made with chai tea!).  The cocktails were insane. I loved all of them, and as always loved the drai laag beer. The seasonal sangria was very autumnal and tasted divine. Our water was adorable and sweet and incredibly helpful. He read through ALL the specials in a well paced manner and was super funny.  We ordered WAY TOO MUCH SUSHI. But we needed to have it. We got four orders of sushi and my sister got ramen.  The ramen looked AMAZING. She ate so much of it and there was still about 3/4 left. Definitely a lot of food for the money.  The sushi was really great, we got a spicy salmon, tuna, smoked mackerel, and another salmon sushi (sorry I forget the names). They were all really good but the spicy salmon and mackerel were definitely my favorite.  My sister ordered desert and SHE LOVED IT. They were \"asian churros\" with a hot honey sauce and caramel. I tried a bite, the honey was definitely spicy but in a very complimentary way. It was a slow deep burn that blended well with the whipped cream, caramel, and cinnamon. This is a place I will certainly go again. I enjoyed everything I had.  Why did I detract a star? It's not THE BEST SUSHI EVER. But it's definitely in the top 5!"}
{"text":"The happy hour deal is amazing. Can't beat half off all drinks! Everything I've tried here was awesome. The drunken noodle bowl is an 8/10, hanger steak bowl is 10/10, lobster monkey roll and key lime scallop roll were both 10/10. The sushi and bowls are great. Highly recommend. Cute outdoor atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"So many four and five star reviews from Yelp Elite can't be wrong, right? RIGHT!  Picked up asian takeout for three tonight for just under $30- seafood soup, beef pad se ew, and chicken masaman curry, extra side of rice. Portions were okay but were split among three, pricing was fair but seafood soup could have been larger. Good for $7 price, but not a meal on its own. Curry was heavy on the potatoes, so with the rice it was pretty starchy, but that kept it from being too spicy. Pad se ew was among the best BF has had, and it's the main thai dish he gets everywhere we go. Side note about the soup: pick out the green pepper pieces prior to eating unless you want to spit out your soup in spicy surprise. Otherwise, the mix of crab, mussels, shrimp, and octopus is delightful.  Service was good. Ordered to go, just a few minutes prior to close, and was helped with a smile and the order was out quick. Saw a few pictures of dishes above the counter after we ordered, but did not find them on the menu itself- shrimp and fish ball soup, duck soup, etc., unclear whether they're special features, by request only, or no longer on the menu.  Would come back here, and we'd likely try different dishes- the garlic chicken in particular caught my eye, as did the drunken noodles. Maybe better for lunch specials though, pricing looks a little better at ~$7/dish."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a friend for a duo birthday lunch.  What a nice gift to us!  The red duck curry was savory and meaty (not at all like the greasy, skinny roast duck you get at places in Chinatown).  Chowed down on the calamari.  Drunken noodles did not disappoint.  We listened to the server about the spice levels, but next time will amp it up a notch.  Can't wait to go back again to sample more of the chef's creations.  This restaurant lived up to its great reviews and am proud to slap another set of 5 stars on it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I have ever had by far. Their red chicken curry is perhaps the best thing I have ever eaten. Love their lunch specials. Very spicy so you may want to go down a number or two from your normal preference.  Great service, food, and prices. Just check your bag, they have forgotten my rice a few times when I have larger orders :)"}
{"text":"Order the spice at 8 or 9, it's perfect. If you order the spicy chicken salad it is important to ask for it extra hot. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Too hot for me, other then that, sorry I didn't see it. Friendly atmosphere but pretty plain for anything but lunch, for me.  Lots if rave reviews so see for yourself"}
{"text":"Lunch Specials starting at $6.95.    Met some family here for lunch.  I had the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad for $8.95.  Mixed greens, cashew nuts, mango, red onions, bell peppers, Asian herbs, chili lime dressing.  Such a perfect, tasty, light and healthy lunch!  We also had SCALLOP AMOK - $8.95.  Napa cabbage, lime leaf, lemon grass, chili, basil and coconut steamed in a banana leaf - Cambodian Style.  This was the first time I had ever seen or had Amok and it was so delicious!  I will defintely have this again!  We also had Pineapple Fried Rice but we left the Shrimp out due to someone with an allergy.  Oh so wonderful. - $10.95 Chicken, pineapple, cashew nuts, raisins, tomatoes, onions, scallions and egg.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  The seasonings were fresh and authentic Thai.    I also love that the decor is modern and fresh and relaxing.  You can bring in a large family or  have a small table, this restaurant still provides an relaxing environment.   David came out and chatted with us a during the meal and made sure we had everything we needed to have a wonderful experience and that the kids had what they needed.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've had the Singapore noodles a couple times, it's likely the best I've had. Bok Choy is a favorite along w rice noodles, the sauce is excellent and a little on the hot side. #6 on the heat scale brings on head sweats, the little mushroom caps are the hottest thing in the dish.  I've picked up food at least 8 times and have never seen the place dirty, the kitchen is clean has never smelled like grease or anything foul. This is my favorite Thai place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went back to PAN. Unfortunately  they have suffered quite a bit of personnel turnover. Management appears to be quite poor. For example there was one poor server taking care of the entire patio of 7 tables.  Portion sizes have also shrunk with the jalapeño tuna nigiri consisting of 5 measly pieces."}
{"text":"Totally addicted to the fried rice here, it is amazing! I get it as a take out meal a couple times per week and it is enough for lunch the next day. I have never had a bad meal here and everyone that works here is super friendly. Thanks for all the great take out! ~ Travis"}
{"text":"so my hubby and i have been searching for good authentic thai food for 7 years...finally found an amazing spot! the owners are sweet and the food is GREAT!!!  must try the esarn sausage with sticky rice...she makes her own sausage...yummmmm=p"}
{"text":"It's simple....... This is the best Thai Food in Vegas and I've had it all.  Specifically, their Panang curry is the best I've ever had.  These guys are professional cooks and every dish is cooked to order.  I get a spice of 10 of 10 and it's the hottest in town!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Vegas a few weeks ago and gave this place a try. I got take out, and was pleasantly satisfied with my Clear noodles w/ pork and a side of gyoza. It tasted fresh and the owner looked like he was about his craft. That's a great thing. Service was fast quick and the price wasn't too bad for me either. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has really good Thai food, if u like the real spicy food Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is exceptional at all levels, from service to the quality of food. The drinks were amazing as well! The sushi rolls were made to perfection, and happy hour at the bar offered a great variety of choices."}
{"text":"Came for lunch because I heard they have good pad see yew, and I love pad see yew!   FOOD Pad see yew with Tofu (4 stars): You choose how spicy you want it, level 1 to 10, and the chilis are SPICY so be careful! I chose a 1 sine I was warned about the spice, but I couldn't taste any chili so I asked them to bring out chili and it tasted much better. Next time I think I'll go for a 3. My friend got a 4 and it was spicy, pretty sure a 5 would make me cry, haha. Can't even imagine what a 10 tastes like. Everything tasted fresh. The tofu could have had more flavor, but the noodles were really good! And the egg in it was really good too, soaked up the sauce!  I need to come back and try more.  SERVICE (5 stars) The waitress was really on top of everything, always filling our waters, which was needed when we added more spice to our dishes, haha. The place is really clean and has a nice atmosphere also. There's only 1 bathroom but it was clean."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town and my fav Basil Fried Rice dish ever. Friendly family, with David as patriarch, great service, clean, clean kitchen and delicious, fresh-tasting dishes."}
{"text":"Food was great but had the worst service. Asked for silverware and waiter was able to find 4 forks for our party of 10. He opened a can of beer and overflowed it on the floor no apologies just left the wet glass on the table dripping. Asked for water only filled 2 peoples water. Also made a smart comment when asked what something was on the menu. Food was great but not worth the poor service. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I can see this place from my house, so it's about time I gave it a shot. Searched Yelp!for something near by and was steered in by all of the great reviews. Stopped in for take out around 6:30pm. Smells great and has a really warm environment.  The first thing that I noticed is that the dinning area is 1/3 the size of the open kitchen. You can see everything they are doing, which I tend to like.   The gentleman working there (Owner?) was extremely friendly. He asked if I had eaten there before. When I said no, he asked it I eat Asian food often and If I would need assistance deciding what to eat. I found this to be very thoughtful.  I ordered chicken Pad See Ew which was ready in well under 10 minutes. WARNING: I got #2 spicy and it kinda kicked my ass.  I docked them 1 STAR for giving me A CHOP STICK, which as far as I am aware, are supposed to come in pair. Not their fault, but when I want to pretend that I came being \"cultural\", I need the right utensils :)    THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Lazy Sunday, wandering Butler Street for a spot to eat. Stopped in here to find the best dining experience I've had in recent memory. The server was extremely personable and made some excellent recommendations. Food blew us all away. The music was surprisingly noticeable, with enjoyable selections. Can't wait until our next visit! 5 stars doesn't seem enough!"}
{"text":"I love Pan Asian. It's my go to place for Thai food. I love the DW shrimp fried rice. I'm not very big on Pad Thai but this place's pad Thai is the ish. Lunch special is a great deal too, lots of delicious dish to choose. My only problem with this place is the spicy level sometimes. Sometimes it's over done. I ordered a 3 spice level and to me it felt like 7. I play it safe now and go lower on the spice level."}
{"text":"I don't know what goes on here, but have been here a number of times.... the service was terrible on the last visit and will not be going back as a result. Place was half empty, the new waitress was rude, inattentive and disrespectful. When I asked where my drink was, she actually shushed me like I was her child. She never came by after the food came to ask how it was or to refill drinks. Time to find another Thai restaurant..."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times, and their lunch specials are good. However, when I purchased won ton soup \"to go\" for lunch, I was disappointed in the quantity of won ton and portion of the soup.  I would of thought I would at least have more soup base, but didn't. It was very small bowl, and only FOUR won tons. For $5.95, that's pretty steep in cost for the over all portions size. Usually a tiny small bowl like that I have seen in other restaurants were between $2.95-$3.75.  The soup was good, but didn't enjoyed the experience as I was a bit annoyed on how much I paid for such as small portion.  It's not like it's a 5 star restaurant which I would expect it to be pricey.    The next time I want soup, I better off going to Chinatown or Panda Express.  Better value in my money and 3x as much soup and product."}
{"text":"Thursday night and my sisters and I were looking for a place to eat.  We were thinking somewhere different yet worth it.  I didn't want to go too far and i didn't want to spend a ton of money either so I suggested Pan Asian.  I had been there before, but my sisters had yet to experience this fabulous little restaurant.       We got there about 7 and were the only ones in the restaurant.  We were immediately greeted by the owner.  He told us the specials, a whole red snapper deep fried and served with a sweet chili sauce, and crispy duck served similar to Peking style.  While looking at the paper menu, I couldn't help thinking that the specials sounded amazing.  So we ordered the green papaya salad, the red snapper, and the crispy duck.       We ordered the green papaya salad with a spicy scale of 3, but when I tasted it, it seemed spicier.  It was really good, with great flavor and a nice crunch, but we couldn't get pass the spiciness.  Chef Lisa apologized and said she used a fresh chili and could see that it was spicier than normal.  She said she would tone it down a bit for the red snapper.    The red snapper came out and looked beautiful.  It was sitting upright on a plate with lots of veggies and a nice sweet chili sauce.  I normally do not eat fish, but the snapper was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it so well.  I couldn't help but have some.  We ended up eating the whole thing.      I love duck and was not disappointed with Chef Lisa's crispy duck.  The crispy duck was served with flour tortillas and 3 different sauces: mango, hoisin, and curry.  Along with the several pieces of crispy duck was crispy duck sauteed with bok choy in a black bean type sauce.  The duck was crispy on the outside and so tender and moist on the inside.  It had a great anise/five spice flavor that is common in duck.  All of the sauces were great with the duck and I thought the tortillas were a nice change from the buns you normally get with Peking duck.  The sauteed crispy duck with the bok choy was equally amazing with lots of flavor.  If this was on the menu by itself, it would be worth ordering as well.    The bill came out to where I expected it to be.  The food was well worth the price.  It was gourmet, but in a place where I wasn't afraid to use my hands with the duck or the fish.  I will definitely go back to Pan Asian and I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu as well as any other specials that they may have."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas hands down! David is awesome I wish they delivered but their food is sooo worth the pick up! Their Chicken Basil is the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food cant be this good. Nothing on this universe tastes as good as food from Chef Lisa. It shouldnt!! It defies some laws of physics!!  So here are my theories on why the food is so good or how it was made:  - The Restaurant is actually a wormhole or gateway to a parallel universe where food is always that good. If this is the case i want to journey to this parallel universe and never leave.  - Chef Lisa is a robot or an android or a cybernetic being sent from the future to help us fight against crappy food. This would explain how she got three orders to come out all at the same time without aid  - Chef Lisa is a wizard, she conjures up food using magic, wizardry, spells. This would explain the fast service and magical taste of the food.  - Chef Lisa is an alien that uses advanced technology to create food that will blow us away.  If this is the case then her intentions are not clear but may include but are not limited to  + studying our social habits  + fattening us up for invasion/dinner  + observing mating rituals  + set us upon one another and destroy the very fabric of society in search of that oh so good bowl of noodles  The food can only be described as 'supernatural'. Regardless of how and why it came to be i will willfully and happily return again and again."}
{"text":"Good Asian fusion food, especially for its price.   Food is great. We tried 8 different dishes on the menu and you could not go wrong with any of them. The pineapple fried rice was definitely savory and packed with flavor. Chicken lettuce wrap was a good appetizer to share. Chicken ravioli appetizer was also good, but it seemed more like dumplings. I suggest sharing food family style so you can try the many great dishes here.  Thai tea/coffee was good but it's on the pretty sweet side. You may want to ask them not to make it so sweet beforehand.   service was great - friendly interaction with the whole staff - not just the waiter but the chef and sous chefs. Easy seating, very attentive.   Bathroom is clean, so the kitchen is clean too!   I'd go back here."}
{"text":"my fave Thai place used to be Pin Kaow on rainbow and robin dale, but the dishes they served went from delicious to awful (I gave them 2 chances after a few months later and was still disappointed). I'm not sure if they are on a budget on ingredients or had a change of chef.   I stumbled upon Pan Asia, and oh my!!! this is by far the best Thai food I've had. I have been going here for about a year now (2-3x a month), it is worth the 8 mile drive, their food never disappoints me.   I normally order basil fried rice, mango salad, Thai lettuce wrap, and fried ice cream. I have tried other dishes as well.   My only thing is the spiciness level. From 1-10. #3 is already flaming hot.  They should have a spicy food contest, whoever wins can get a free entree lol."}
{"text":"Decent food and service. Highly recommended. They have the best noodles. Went with my family and friends. We all had a great time."}
{"text":"First word that comes to mind: SPICY!  Watch the spice level!  1-10 is not the same as other places... so when they warn you, please take heed.    I really like Pan Asian.  When we went on Saturday- we were the first customers in the joint.  They accommodated our party of 9 + a baby.  It's not a very large place.. We literally took up half of the restaurant.  Our waiter was very polite, as was the rest of the staff.  He made a lot of good suggestions, warned us about the heat levels.... and immediately took our order since we had some time to look at the menus .    I don't even remember what everyone else had.. but i remember what I had. ha!  I started with the malaysian roti because I love that stuff... and Pan Asian did not disappoint.   The yellow curry was creamy and full of flavor.    My entree: was MORE CURRY! Massaman, and I love it!    *What I do remember is my daughter ordering the vietnamese shrimp ravioli and marking the heat at 1-- and it was WAAAAAY to hot... even for the spice lovers at the table.    Next time we are ordering with 0 spice.  hahaha.. seriously.  If this place wasn't so far I'd be visiting as often as we visit our favorite local thai joint in our area.   But it's a definite must try.  there's plenty of different items to choose from... and if you have no idea, let them know what you're feeling and they'll definitely point you in the right direction!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I just love the service.   Other places that shall remain nameless treat you like you are an inconvenience..hard to get refils, dont offer advice, just general lack of personable qualities.    Now about the food. Had massaman curry and drunken noodles first visit.  Both soild choices and would order again.   This time got the tom kha soup spice level 2 (just a hint of heat for me) on recommendation of another review.  The flavor is very good but I prefer it a bit more creamy like kinnaree or thai noodle house.  Always get roti...its sinfully good here.    Will be back to try more when I  the area!"}
{"text":"This is my friend's favorite restaurant in the city, and I can see why: the food was flavorful and affordable, it is centrally-located, and the service was fantastic. I had my favorite, Pad See Eau, and it was one of the best dishes I've had in the city. My friend swears by the curry.   The place is casual and a bit small but very clean and modern-looking (my friend says they recently went through a renovation - it looks good)! I would definitely recommend grabbing a bite here."}
{"text":"I'm in love. Great dishes, made with fresh ingredients quickly. Small, unassuming place with very attentive staff. Plus: a 7 is an 11 at a lesser place. MUST COME BACK"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their thai iced tea recipe is awesome and so is the pad see yew. The spiciness in all of their dishes hurt so good."}
{"text":"We are on the search for a new Thai restaurant... at every new restaurant we order the Pad Thai and Green Curry to compare to other Thai restaurants.  We also order a 3rd item to just try.  I order Tofu (fried) Pad Thai with 0 spice and it was ok, nothing great, not much flavor.  I usually order it without spice but this was overly bland.  My husband ordered the Chicken Green Curry with 2 spice.  There was lots of flavor in the Green Curry, but it was full of green beans, not much meat and the flavor was \"different\".  I took a bite, and the 2 spice was too spicy for me.  For our 3rd item we ordered the Filet Mignon \"Pho\" with 1 spice, which again for me was too spicy.  I wanted just a little kick, but the spice was overpowering.  My husband loved the Pho, and if we go back it would be just for the soup."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant!   I was on the hunt for spicy food, some of my fellow yelpers recommended this place so I decided to give Pan Asian a try.   As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.   For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time.   For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream.   Overall we loved our entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly! Plus it's inexpensive, for an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and dessert, we only spent $38. I highly recommend Pan Asian, I can't wait to come again and try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"We got the Restaurant Week deal, which was a sushi platter and a bowl for just $20. I'm not typically a huge fan of sushi but both sushi platters we got tasted great and might convert me to become a regular sushi eater. The drunken noodles had that wonderful wok stir-fry taste to it, and the noodles were extremely soft - a rarity when I eat these noodles. The hangar stir-fry, however, came off as quite salty. I think it's because I asked for a super spicy dish, and their spice may or may not have had a significant salt component. I ended up drinking 3 glasses of water, but the waiter was super nice about my feedback and even asked me if I wanted a new dish. I kindly declined the offer, and then when I got the bill, they didn't charge me for the stir-fry at all! The people here seem to be really receptive to feedback, so I'm willing to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Some of the best duck curry I've eaten has been here!! Super crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. You have to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I've been there several times. Mango/shrimp salad is amazing. The curries are very flavorful. They use top notch ingredients. You can taste the quality in the food. Everything is fresh and home made. Never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Everyone pay attention... I'm a big yelper and it's amazing the places I find on yelp. I'm from Los Angeles, CA and I came to Las Vegas, NV for a wedding. My siblings and myself got so hungry before the big day. So we came to eat and try out this place. Amazing amazing amazing. Best food ever. Best volcano chicken better than orange chicken. I'm in love with the food here. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been dragged to this location on several occasions by my girl. It's usually when I'm in the mood to stay home and she's craving Thai. I hem and haw, but I'm always glad to come here. The food is really good and not too expensive. I have tried several different dishes and have never been disappointed. A must is always the roti, but the noodles and fish dishes are solid too."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about this place was that it is SMALL. The dining room only has 8 tables. The setup is kinda weird, the kitchen is open and basically in the dining room but behind a long counter.   David (the owner) greeted me and told me my order would be ready shortly (I called ahead.) I ordered the yellow curry chicken and added pineapples. I said I did not want it spicy and I am glad after reading all of the reviews because it seems like they are big on spice.   The curry had lots of veggies, red/green pepper, onions and sweet potato. It was different than what I am used to. The flavors were good, and I enjoyed my dinner. I probably would get the curry a little spicy next time, because the spicier it is the more flavor it has. I will come back here to try some other items."}
{"text":"Pan was awesome! Great atmosphere, food, staff, restroom. Nice open kitchen, I thanked the chefs, and server. Started with roasted vegetables and kale with sesame ginger sauce, then Green Pan Maki roll, soy paper wrap, cucumber, avocado, seaweed salad. Then Korean Fried Tofu with the best house-made Kimchi I've had in a while(spicy!). With the Chang Mai Cauliflower we had a filling inexpensive, delicious vegetarian meal. Highly recommend for plant and animal eaters alike. Great place! Pan has an awesome app and website. Check it aht!"}
{"text":"From the delightful staff to the incredible food this is become my new favorite pho place"}
{"text":"The service, the food and the atmosphere get a 5 from me.   I have been wanting to try this place and admit I'm a sucker for sitting in a sexy chill room while I maneuver fork from plate to mouth. Side note: if it's gravy, forget about it...I'm the one in the corner licking the plate. Back on topic...the inside of this place is very warm and inviting with tones and hues that scream...Welcome!  Once seated, we perused the menu and stumbled upon the edamame and tempura veggies. After they arrived to our table, it was love at first bite. The edamame was well seasoned in an asian sauce that did not overpower. The tempura veggies were coated in thee lightest batter I've ever seen and complimented the delicate textures well.   Normally when dining with out, I'll try to order something different but the Hangar steak stir fry caught our eyes. Look, the steak in this was so good I had to personally thank the chef. The rice was seasoned well with the right amount of perfectly cut veggies and egg.   Our entire meal, start to finish, was executed very well. Can't wait to visit again and try something new. Just one more reason to love our great city!"}
{"text":"Mehhh. They don't deliver so I had to go pick it up. Chicken satays were dry and overcooked but tasty. Basil fried rice was mushy and over sauced. Scant (3 small) shrimp and 6-7 pieces of chicken. All the right favors but heavy handed execution. Chicken and vegetable stir fry with black bean and ginger was the best of them all. I have to say that after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp we were very disappointed. To top it off, one app and two entree came to $30. Not bad if it was a quality meal but this owing one of those."}
{"text":"Excellent. David the owner (I guess) is funny and jokes with you.   We had the yellow curry chicken...heat level 1. No heat. :)  And pad thai....heat level 3. Heat stays for just a minute, then gone. :)  Food so good. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place is sure a hole in the wall. If your  not a native to Vegas it's like an adventure here but worth it. The chefs are two women who definitely knows what they are doing! Looks very professional and gourmet. If the guy ask you how spicy you want it? i recommend the mild, they serve it spicy if you say \"spicy\"! *WARNING* This place was great and good for family style."}
{"text":"Order was delivered in good time. Food tasted pretty average. Food tasted just OK. Sauce and texture of the chicken were less than average. This was my first time ordering from them. I am definitely not enthused about their food's quality. Rating should be more of 2.5"}
{"text":"The best Thai and pho I've tried. We ordered the shrimp Panang curry, pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, pho, wonton soup and each order was  amazingly delicious. An explosion of flavours! Careful with the spicy levels. I eat Habaneros like candy and considered a number 5 to be  mild. The service was great! The owner was super friendly. Wish this place was in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Every time we have been here and that is quite often the food is always full of flavor! Most places never make the food spicy enough for me but this place listens when I say Thai spicy! I think it's family owned and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant and their food. My favorite Thai restaurant in town. Whenever we eat Thai and it's not here I am disappointed because no other place measures up! I have learned my lesson this is the only Thai food I'll eat!"}
{"text":"Ordered valcano chicken, tiger shrimp mango salad and salmon dish....all delicious and good amount of food. A very small dining place, but has simple and tasteful deco. Definitely will return in the future. Owner, David is friendly and serves food himself."}
{"text":"I can really imagine how good the food is at home in Wong family! So eating at Pan Asian will only give me a slight taste of their kitchen at home!   We tried the Pad Thai and Pork ribs w/ XO sauce. Both were delicious. I love how spicy the pad Thai was and I only had a level 3. My only complaint was that the noodles were kinda stuck together.   The pork ribs were wonderful and savory! The ribs were slightly crispy on the outside and nicely tender on the outside.   David Wong himself served us and he was very nice and funny!  I really enjoyed it here and can't wait to come back and try their pho!"}
{"text":"So I was feeling a little blue today, it was gloomy and cold in Vegas and needed something to pick me up. Great food always helps to get me in the mood, LOL so I drove 15 miles to have a late lunch here.   This time I had the Grilled mango salad, Basil fried rice and Chicken Red curry. Excellent choices. The red curry was exceptional. Since Pan Asian is not close to where I live, I ordered all 3 dishes with the intent of taking home the rice and curry. David was wondering if someone else was joining me because I ordered a lot of food for 1 person, LOL.   I love the food and love the personal service. The owners - David and Lisa remember you and make you feel at home. That's very rare when you dine at Asian restaurants so they deserve a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"A small Asian restaurant. Excellent food, very spicy if you enjoy that. You simply have to choose the number on a scale of 1 to 10. However, start with five or less if you are not used to hot food. We had pad Thai and a curry dish both were excellent. Try it out you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times and have always left very satisfied.  Place is small, about 12 tables, and tucked away off of Durango.  I've tried quite a few apps, soups, and entrees and have been pleased with everything.  Tom Khar soup and Papaya salad are just plain delicious.  I will say one thing, there food is SPICY.  I enjoy spicy food but this can almost be on another level - at other Thai restaurants I would get a 7 or 8, here I go 4 or 5.  Definitely give this place a chance, the staff is friendly with the owner always behind the counter, and the food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Fresh, crisp, healthy, delicious. Feels like you are sitting in David and Lisa Wong's kitchen as they serve you food cooked with love.  This will be a regular for my family and I."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about three years now.  The Red Curry with Pumpkin and Eggplant (+ choice of protein) is the best dish in my opinion.  One thing to note is that this place is the spiciest food I've had.  The 8 here is hotter than most tens."}
{"text":"This hidden gem of a restaurant is amazing. I can't believe I drive by this place all the time and never noticed. A co worker of mine introduced me to this place and I have been back multiple times ever since. I have only tried a couple of their dishes and all of them were delicious. I have tried the Basil Fried Rice which is bomb. DW Fried Rice...delish. Also the Pho....who would of thought to get Pho at a place like this....but let me tell you...it cured my hangover. The Pho is soo packed with flavor! A must try. Im sure all the other dishes are just as amazing. Service is great and you don't have to wait long for your food. If you crave asian food then definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"The yellow curry is amazing! If you get their spice rack, definitely try the dried spice. It has a nice smokey flavor. We got some to go & we put it on everything at home. It's delicious! I feel bad for not knowing her name, but the adorable server is always super friendly & her relationship with the owners is adorable also! We always come for dinner & get two plates-one of the ALWAYS the yellow curry! One of my favorite Thai places!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has four stars. First, the restaurant was BLaSTING club music on the outside patio. I might not mind this if it was later in the evening but it was only 7pm. It was so obnoxious I could barely hear over it. Our table was gross and sticky. The waiter got our order wrong ( he comped it) and the food was only so so. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"My first visit here was not a disappointment.  Hubby and I were warmly greeted by David and were immediately charmed by his friendliness and good humour.  We chose the roti for an appy and the crispy duck (today's special, $19.95, probably one of the priciest items on the menu).  The roti came with a lovely curry sauce, more sweet than spicy.  Our duck was lovely, crispy, and meaty.  Accompanying the duck were three sauces: curry, hoisin, and mango (my fave), along with stir-fried bok choy, steamed rice, and tortilla wraps.  I'm so glad I shared the duck, as portions were generous.    David came by several times to refill our water glasses and to admonish us to \"share our food.\"  He also looked at my husband valiantly nabbing julienned slices of carrot and told him: \"don't waste the food.\"  :)  The restroom was spotless, definitely a great sign for a restaurant.  We will most definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Finally a Thai restaurant that I actually enjoyed, although it's not necessarily in the most convenient location for me to frequent a lot.   We came here for Sunday lunch on the recommendation of my friend and I was definitely not disappointed. The prices are reasonable and the selection of choices have your usual favorites of Thai food. The waiter warned us as we were ordering about the spice level (from 1-10)...we were told to get about a 3-4 as that would be spicy enough. It had a good kick and after eating the entire meal, I could feel the spice, but it was not overwhelming. I can only imagine the burning of a 7-8. HOT STUFF!  We got a nice selection of food...started with the Crying Tiger (Thai Beef Salad)...we were asked how much do we want to cry (spice level). We didn't cry that much. And for family style entrees to share around the table, we ordered the Red Curry (chicken), the garlic pepper stir fry (pork), and the drunken noodles (beef). All had a nice amount of spice and really good flavor.   I'm looking forward to the next time that I will venture up to this area to try some of the other dishes that they have to offer."}
{"text":"The decor is casual and little cold, but the food is fantastic, the service attentive and fast. I recommend this restaurant for a quick bite."}
{"text":"A very casual atmosphere, but nicely presented dishes. We enjoyed the papaya salad. Very fresh. We also liked the curry chicken. The staff were friendly and fun. The chicken satay is also very tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Just a quick update since I've been getting delivery from Pan Asian quite frequently from roadrunnerfood.com.  Hint:  It's listed on the website under David Wong's Pan Asian, not just Pan Asian.  The delivered food has been just as tasty as the items I've had in the restaurant.  And the food keeps really well.  Right now, I'm having some of the basil fried rice and grilled octopus salad for breakfast from the night before. :)  They may be running out of proper to go containers because occasionally I get rice in a strange container (making me think upon first inspection that they forgot the rice) or the liquidy curry in a standard foam hinged carryout wrapped in a plastic bag. They usually pack it in a soup container. But it's all good because the delivery folks are pretty careful with it.  More careful than I would be.    Food is still great, but now there is delivery if you are willing to pay the delivery service charge for the third party delivery service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food :) We will be coming back (especially to try the fried ice cream)."}
{"text":"I always held Archi as the cream of the crop comes too Thai food but Pan Asian took over the title. I always meaning too check this place out between recommendations from fellow yelpers! I had the grilled thai shrimp mango salad and the chicken panang curry was the da bomb! The salad not often really high on any salad dish but this one for sure so hearty and full of flavors I could do salad every day in life. They use organic mixed greens (not common head lettuce or romaine or bland salad greens), the dressing is divine (If could steal that salad dressing; sign me up!), the tiger shrimp cooked perfection not dried out moist with nice grilled marks, the MANGO for me that the star of the dish so FRESH (Mango in most restaurants over ripe or under ripe) could eat Mango by itself, and combine everything together toss it together salad ecstasy. Truly appreciate about this salad it many components it has every EVERY part be like plate of Mango, plate of shrimp, etc. Amazing! I could get plate of each. The chicken panang was excellent too! I enjoyed everything but not only the sauce has nice depth too it besides nice little kick. The vegetables in it. Green beans nice fresh, and bell peppers nice crunch or al dente bite too them. Tien great recommendations on both dishes! So many more dishes without doubt be coming back for more.  The spice level at Pan Asian no joke. I have been too my share of thai restaurants there times that each place spice level never know what too expect if its truly 6 or above. Not that I mind because I enjoy spicy food. It nice change knowing that if want get some heat get it. I had the 3 on the grilled shrimp mango salad. The owner warned me not go above 3 or 4. Good call. I kind of sweating it out on the salad little bit. The chicken panang got 6 just right.   If want some good thai or pan asian food. No better place too go!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. The food has a lot of flavor, but be careful because their spicy degree is very high, so start off 2 or 3. Everything is yummy!"}
{"text":"Pan Asian has great tasting food for a great price. The few times that i have been here both David the owner and his wife chef Lisa have always been great host.  If you haven't had the pleasure of eating at this great restaurant please stop by to enjoy these great dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Las Vargas. Love the staff; very kind and know my boyfriend and I by our first names. Favorite dish is Cashew Chicken. Love that they're not afraid to spice it up!"}
{"text":"A majorly delayed review, I have eaten at Pan Asian at least 6 times since it opened and I have to say, if you want a noodle dish, go with the Thai Linguine with vegetables. This dish is one of the best looking (and tasting) bowls of noodles I've ever experienced. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the dish is wok seared in a light soy-sauce with spice level dialed to request. The veggies are bright and fresh: red/green bell peppers, white onions, sliced tomatoes and asparagus. This is THE dish to crave, and Chef Lisa describes it as her 'favorite' as well. First-timers are making a big mistake not ordering this one.   The woks are perfectly seasoned at Pan Asian. No weird aftertastes from cheap sesame oil or five-spice here. This is something to take note of anytime there is a wok involved.   Do the right thing - GET THE LINGUINE, spice level 3 and you will be good to go."}
{"text":"Food here was great! The kitchen was right in front of your face! You can tell when you tasted the food everything tasted fresh. Next time I come I hope they have hainan chicken. It was a special the time I went but I just wasnt in the mood at the time."}
{"text":"The service here is just like any typical asian place, not really stellar or anything.   The crying tiger salad for me was very weird like it had this crunchy thing that made me just want to stop eating it. The fried rice was good but the chicken was kinda bland, but rice was so flavorful. The beef noodle soup was very good spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"D-licious.  Been wanting to knock off a few of my \"to try\" places, so I decided to hit Pan Asian.  Super friendly service from greeting to departure.  The menu is an interesting mix of various Asian foods, from Thai dishes like pad see ew to the Singapore specialty of Hainanese chicken rice.  We had the crying tiger salad, the special of duck with red curry, the volcano chicken and the glass noodles.  The salad was probably the best salad I have ever eaten.  It was fresh, a little spicy, had some texture to it and the beef was delicious.  The duck was excellent as well.  No gaminess or greasy duck texture, crispy skin and tender inside, with an interesting red curry with grapes, pineapple, cashews, and peppers.  The volcano chicken was similar to an orange chicken, but not as sweet and cheap like you are given in most \"Chinese\" restaurants that serve that **** for American tastes.  It reminded me of Dumpling Inn in San Diego and their orange chicken.  Good hunks of white meat, and good flavor.  The noodles were also tasty.  Several shrimp, with a good mix of veggies.  For dessert, we had the tempura cheesecake, which is just as it sounds.  A hunk of ice cream with whipped cream and a tempuraed piece of cheesecake.  Decadent and delicious.    Overall, a superb addition to the rotation and a great meal.  The gentleman who served us (the owner?) was awesome.  Super friendly and hilarious sense of humor.  The décor was also nice and the inviting.  One of the best restaurants I have found in a long while and we will be back...soon.  For 3 entrees, the salad and 1 dessert, plus a thai tea, it was $68 including tax.  The duck special was the priciest item at $22, otherwise everything else was around $9-$11.  For two of us, we could have made do with one less entrée also, and I eat a LOT, so we could easily see coming in around $50 and being very happy for 2."}
{"text":"Holy crap! The other Yelpers aren't kidding when they say this place is great.   Pan Asian is tucked away in a strip mall and it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. But it's definitely worth seeking out! The owner wasn't the friendliest which usually stands out in my mind, but the food was so amazing that I quickly forgave and forgot.  The restaurant itself is very small with limited seating and has a sort of \"fast food\" feel to it (maybe like a step or two up from the atmosphere of a Subway restaurant.) Although, I believe they do offer waiter-service if you choose to eat inside. It's also very clean and the kitchen is wide open, which I thought was neat. Overall, it's a perfect lunch-spot but certainly not somewhere you'd take a date.  I ordered my food to-go and went off the menu that's posted on the wall. I ordered the fried calamari, the stir-fried linguine and the crying tiger salad.   The calamari was very bland and the dipping sauce didn't help it out much at all. But the linguine and the salad made up for it with flying colors!   I ordered the linguine at a spicy-level of 8 which is perfect for me at every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas because I loooove spicy, but Pan Asian does not mess around. An 8 set my mouth on fire, but the dish was still so freaking delicious that I ate it anyway, gulping water in between each bite. I will definitely order it again but probably at a spicy level of 5 or 6 next time.  I ordered the crying tiger salad for my husband (at a spicy level of 3) but it seriously had to be the best salad I've ever had because I couldn't stop stealing bites from him. I don't know how they made the dressing but it's incredible. I truly believe that even people who aren't huge fans of salad (like me) would love this. It's just drenched in flavor. That's the best I can describe it.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in the area. Two thumbs up for Pan Asian!"}
{"text":"The Pad See-Yew here is absolutely AMAZING!!!!  We have tried other menu items like the Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Vegetables with Garlic Pepper Sauce and all are great.  We have not been disappointed yet.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere great.  You must try them."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a bite to eat after Wine down Wednesday at The Silverton. Traci T raves about it and we caught it before they closed! I got Massaman Curry dinner, no spice. When we got it home Traci T said I got about half the size that portion usually is. Bummer since it was sooo good. I'll try it again but I'll make sure before I leave I got the right portion size."}
{"text":"I have ordered a few different things from here and I like everything except the red curry. Drunken Noodles are great. There are a ton of potatoes in the red curry which seems odd and almost just like a filler. It actually takes a lot of the flavor out of the dish and makes it overall mushy and starchy. I would specifically order it without the potatoes if you do order it."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time earlier this weekend and have been craving their pho ever since! We ordered gyoza, drunken noodles, and filet mignon pho. All of it was delicious! We couldn't finish the pho because the spice level was insane- I ordered a 3 (1 to 10 scale, we were warned that the 5 was spicy). The beef was good and tender, there were plenty of noodles, and despite clearing out my sinuses, the broth was sooooo good. Like I said, I'm craving it as I type this. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'd say this is probably one of the most overpriced fusion sushi place I've ever encountered. Food was mediocre at best, and the price is just way too high for the quality (and even quantity) of food that you're getting. I had most of the sushi that was recommended to me by my server (about 4 rolls) and I couldn't taste anything but the sauce that comes on them. I'm more of a traditional sushi kind of person, but this is just way too disappointing for the price. Not sure how this place is surviving, but definitely not because of their food."}
{"text":"Wow! Pretty much describes the reaction me and my family had through the whole dinner. I found Pan Asian on yelp with exceptional reviews but going in skeptical since I come from San Francisco with just \"so so\" thai restaurants. I was proven wrong and highly impressed with the quality of food that we ordered starting with the roti! Mmm mmm!!! Baked nice and flakey with a curry sauce that was just right. On the special was fried red snapper and volcano chicken that was fried to perfection and lightly sauced with exciting flavors. My dad had the salmon which was prepared in a just right where it wasn't raw and not dried. Ambience was casual which was nice because you can dress relaxed eating gourmet style thai food. Lastly, I must commend the great service the staff provided. Waitress was very friendly and attentive, while the owner and his wife were the best hosts you could ever meet! If you're not from here or if you haven't been here yet, make this your first stop for family style cusine eating with a warm hospitable attitude that every great restaurant should have!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. My boyfriend and I come here all the time. The staff is great and so is the service. I would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend to try something new. The food here is so good!!  Family operated place. Mom is the cook in the back, father is the owner/manager, and daughter waitress. I think that added to the whole experience. Service was outstanding here.  We aren't out this way very often and we wanted to try it all. So we ordered 7 dishes. The mom even came out because they thought we were food critics or something. No....we just love eating.  We ordered:  Shrimp Pad Thai - Good but too spicy  Chicken Pad Thai (ordered it less Spicy) - Bomb!  Chicken Pad See Ew - Bomb!  Panang Chicken Curry - good but too spicy  Combination Pineapple Fried Rice - Bomb  Garlic Pepper Chicken - Ok  Volcano Chicken - Bomb   Side note: Be careful when ordering here with the spice level. Normally at Thai restaurants I always get 5/10 for spice. A 5 here is like an 8/10.   Some of the best Thai dishes in Las Vegas! Definitely a must try for really good food and service."}
{"text":"The food here is really good especially with the affordable prices. I highly recommend trying the dynamite shrimp. I eat here every week."}
{"text":"Amazing thai! Don't miss this little hidden gem! Singapore noodles with chicken is our favorite!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I'm not going to write much except that it was DELICIOUS. I came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive. I had the spring rolls and those were delicious. Then I had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp. And I pretty much licked my plate. And all the plates going by looked better and better. I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol. Oh well. There are 254 pics for you to choose from."}
{"text":"PAN ASIAN IS THE BEST. Forget Panda Express, forget P.F. Chang's, forget about any of those sometimes questionable asian buffets, they are mediocre at best.  My girlfriend and I found this place almost a year ago now, and I have to admit I was skeptical at first. However, this place is delish! I enjoy Asian cuisine from time to time, yet I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life -- Chef Lisa is that damn good! The owner David Wong is very nice too! I should've reviewed this place long ago, as we've eaten here dozens of times. I would say top 5 all-time favorite places to eat, period. Very authentic, very fresh.  FAV's: DW Fried Rice, THAI HOT times 1,000 w/lime (still not hot enough). I was never a fan of curry, but my gf says it's great! Garlic/pepper tofu is amazing (you could have chicken instead). Fried ice cream doesn't disappoint.  Good for vegans/vegetarians, or meat eaters.  Basically, go here and eat. Do it. DOOOO IT NOW!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The staff to customer ratio is nearly even. Small and quaint, great service and amazing food! Leave room for the tempura cheesecake!! We had an appetizer, two entrees, desert, hot and iced tea-$40. The service by David himself was worth $1000! Puts the high end B.S Asian eateries to shame. My vote for the best!"}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced for lunch. Had Pad Thai chicken lunch special. Perfect size and priced although lunch special didn't come with soup or anything else other than the Pad Thai. Food was good however."}
{"text":"I am really surprised at the high ratings for this place. I came here three times thinking maybe the next time will be better. I have ordered Tom Yum Goong, a grilled shrimp mango salad, and a Filet Mignon pho. The Tom Yum Goong was just awkward with the glass noodles & big onion slices. It wasn't the Tom Yum Goong I was used to. The shrimp mango salad tasted fishy. I wasn't sure if they put too much fish sauce or if it was from the shrimp.  For my most recent visit. I went with their $5.95 pho. I ordered a spice level 5 which turned out to be too spicy. Call me a wimp but I couldn't finish the broth because it was too spicy. I enjoy a little kick but not too much to the point where it's painful to enjoy and eat. That's why I ordered a spice level in the middle. Their Thai version of pho was not my thing either. I'll just stick with traditional pho. Note, the $5.95 bowl is kid size. You'll probably be hungry after.  The lunch specials does not include soup, egg roll, and a fried wonton like the other Thai restaurants so that's another negative for me. Service was slow the first two times and OK the last visit. If you enjoy extremely spicy food and your butt being on fire, you might enjoy this place. Not for me."}
{"text":"I went there through and because of Yelp and the great reviews. Ordered to go.  The food is really good! The reasons why they lost two stars are: 1) I asked for extra peanuts in my Pad Thai and I got home to discover no peanuts at all. Huge bummer! 2) Its not cheap ($20 for Pad Thai and Calamari) and I paid $2 extra to mix Chicken and Beef. There were maybe 5 peaces of each. A little disappointing and not justifying a $10 dish.  The food is really good. But I wont be going back"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews and the proximity to the office I was working out of while on my last business trip to Las Vegas.  I pulled up to the location and was almost scared off by what I saw from the outside.  It's not much to look at, but I told myself that all these positive reviews had to be for  a reason.  I'm glad I didn't leave.  Everything I had to eat was full of flavor and cooked wonderfully.  On several dishes they ask you how hot you would like it, from 1 to 10, everyone in my party stuck at 5 or below and trust me that was a good thing.  Unless you like really hot stuff a 5 is plenty of heat!  We shared a serving of the chicken wraps and I had a bowl of Pho, both of which were very good.  For the entree I had a duck curry, which came loaded with vegetables and I decided to go with 5 on the heat scale.  My mouth was on fire by the time I had finished, but it was a good fire!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I didn't know about this place but the food is absolutely incredible. The filet pho flavor is amazing! The pork spareribs a MUST to order. The deep fried cheese cake and Thai donuts....again super delicious! Everything we had was just fantastic. We also found out they're on Eat24 so we'll definitely be ordering delivery soon."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! We all (group of 4) were beyond pleased at the taste, quality and value of the food!  DRUNKEN NOODLES are the BEST!  I want to offer some advice for advertising.  You confuse the consumer. Pan Asia is how you list the groupon, and you show up as PAN as your actual name. There are 2 other restaurants called Pan Asia in the Pittsburgh area. We LOVED the food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"What brought me to this place which is about 7 miles west of the the Strip, was a Yelp deal I stumbled upon.  $10 for a $20 gift certificate?  I'm no fool, but that is a great deal!  My hubby and I dined here for lunch on Saturday, March 3rd.  Since we were the only ones dining at the restaurant at the time, we had the choice of sitting where we wanted to which was nice.  This place has a real mom and pop shop type of feel to it. The gentleman who waited on us (I think he may have been one of the owners) was really friendly and helpful.  My hubby and I ordered their Chicken Satay, Garlic Pepper chicken and their Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad and hot tea.   CHICKEN SATAY:  I loved how they used white meat chicken for this.  It was moist, juicy and flavorful.  The peanut sauce tasted fresh and was delicious.  The best peanut sauce ever!  The cucumber relish was also very fresh and complimented this dish very nicely.  GRILLED TIGER SHRIMP MANGO SALAD:  OMG!  A MUST ORDER!!!!  This was probably one of the best Thai style salads I have ever had.  It has baby greens, cashew nuts, mango, red onions, sweet peppers, Asian herbs and chili lime dressing. I loved how it combined the sweetness of the mango, with the spicy, tanginess  of the dressing.  Definitely a flavor match made in heaven.  According to our server, their dressing is homemade.  DAMN!  I wish I could take a bottle of it home!  A warning though, we ordered a spice level of 3 for the salad and the heat sneaks up on you!!  LOL!  Though my tongue was on fire, I could not stop eating it as it was that GOOD!  CHICKEN IN GARLIC PEPPER SAUCE:  Another winner.  If you love garlic, then this is definitely a dish for you!  Full of flavor and just plain yum!  Again, I loved how they use white meat chicken in this dish.    HOT TEA:  Very good.  It has a unique, floral taste to it.     FINAL VERDICT:  WORTH THE DRIVE FROM THE STRIP!  GREAT FOOD, GREAT PRICES (WAY CHEAPER THAN ANYTHING ON THE STRIP), FRIENDLY SERVICE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT!!!    Can't wait to come back!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I had driven past this place too many times...when I saw some positive remarks on the Talk Threads I looked up the reviews and knew that I need to check it out.  I have really enjoyed everything that I've tried.  Panang Curry,Yellow Curry, Massaman Curry, Pad See Ew, Stir Fried Linguini, Drunken Noodles (aka Pad Kee Mao), etc..  My Favorites?...The Yellow Curry and Drunken Nooodles...  The staff is incredible.  Ultra friendly and so helpful!  The kitchen is open to the view of all...thumbs up!  I don't love the seating...feels like a spot between sit down and fast food.  But it is bright and clean inside.  I would certainly dine-in here, but I think this is my new take-out place!"}
{"text":"OMG, I don't even know where to start. But this place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!! This place is a hidden gold mine, but I have found it :D Pan Asian has been bearly open for a month, but I can see a bright future ahead of them.   Wherever  the cook came from, she is a GOD. All the orders are made FRESH to order, you can see her make all the food from scratch, and uses only the freshest ingredients. I had the Tiger Shrimp Mango salad and I have never been more in love with a salad EVER. The pineapple fried rice was also super mega delicious. Good thing is that everything is perfectly proportioned, so you won't end up with an entree that only has a two pieces of meat or whatever. They definitely don't take a cheap shortcut.  Restaurant is obviously new and very clean, the kitchen is balling and huge (the kitchen itself is bigger than the dining area). Menu is very clean and easy to read. Prices are a bit high but reasonable since they use fresh ingredients, cooked to order, and just taste damn good. You do get what you pay for, and every penny is worth it here!  Pan Asian where have you been all my life, I would totally ask the cook to adopt me so I can eat her cooking everyday. This place is a MUST try. I will definitely be back here many, many times.  5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Owner David and his wife are as friendly as can be! It's so nice and very refreshing to know that your business is appreciated! The place is very clean, although small. It's all about the grub here!  Being my first outing, I decided on the Massaman curry, as it had been reviewed favorably by fellow yelpers on more than one occasion. Verdict?  Excellent! Great flavor, and extremely well prepared. I may even try it a bit spicier next time!  For a kicker, I went with the chicken satay app. Very nice...really tasty.  Do not hesitate to give this place a try.  It's very, very good, and the owners appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Another yelp success! It's about 12 minutes away from the strip. We ordered everything that was recommended to us - curry duck and fried ice cream. All items were amazing. If we lived in the area we would be back. Go here, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem.   The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, \"It's the best Jerry, the best!\" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia.   If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food."}
{"text":"I read an article online, \"The 100 most delicious foods\",  that said that  Massaman Curry was the number 1 most delicious food. Obviously I had to try it. Fortunately, I found the Pan Asian restaurant and was amazed at how good this dish is. I went back a second time to see if it was as good as I remembered and it was even better since I asked for a little less spice. Both times I was there, I was the only car in the lot and the place looked closed to me. A small sign said \"open\" so I went in.   I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food  but exceptionally spicy.  They grand the chili on premise.  They made a mistake with my wife's Pad Thai and instead of a 0 it was a 4.  The mistake was in the kitchen and the chef actually came out and apologized and checked up on us a couple of times  We started with Malaysian Roti and then split Chicken Tom Khar which were both very good. I settled on a Garlic Pepper Check at a 4 so my wife could share and it was hotter then an 8 for Mint Chicken at Lotus.  It was however very tasty.  My Wife's new entree was chicken fried rice and it was also very good.  We will be back.  Larry"}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants we have been to. The food quality and taste is perfect. I had Singapore noodles with chicken lunch special and my wife had chicken Tom khar soup with a side of rice. Both were excellent. We also had crispy fried Tofu which was very good - crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. The sauce that comes with it is great. The customer service here is great also. They seen us taking my daughter out of the car and already had a table with high chair waiting for us."}
{"text":"I eat at David Wong's at least once a week and have never been disappointed.  This past weekend my parents were in town and we let Lisa (David Wong's wife, and master chef) choose our menu.  We began with the Malaysian Roti, which is as delicious as it is beautiful.  We then had Panang Curry with Tofu, Yellow Curry with Chicken, Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad, Singapore Noodles with Chicken (my personal favorite, although the Yellow Curry gave it a run for it's money) and ended with some Fried Ice Cream.  My parents both agreed that it was the best Thai meal they had ever had (which says a lot since they are in their 70s and foodies.)    David and Lisa are lovely, friendly people who make an effort to please every customer that comes through the door.  It just doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"A disappointing experience colored by some awkward wait staff, food is not exceptional.  Ambiance is nice, dim lighting with nice artwork.  We sat down and enjoyed the Asian inspired old fashioned, recommend this. They are unfortunately unable to do half glasses of wine even if you are DD.  Their Gyoza are good but only 6 small pieces per serving. Their veggie tempura is a generous amount of heavily battered veggies- not at all the light tempura batter I am used to- tasted all like oily onion rings!  I enjoyed the noodle curry dish but it was heavy on noodles rather than veggies, a good spice level. Our friend ordered a dish with very fatty dark meat chicken that he asked the waitress if he had the correct meat- this led to a awkward and loud encounter where the waitress insisted it was chicken and that he must be completely wrong to question it.  Overall mediocre food and due to service will not be returning."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite Thai restaurant. The Yellow Curry is very delicious."}
{"text":"My last visit to Pan was 6 months ago during Restaurant Week. It wasn't great. However, after posting my review I received a very nice message from Pan and a request to speak by phone.  My conversation with Pan's rep was delightful and she sent me a $25 gift card so I could return for another try. For an apples-to-apples comparison I returned during Restaurant Week once more last night. The good news is, the layout has been updated with regular tables and the ambiance is lovely. Our server was nice enough, though a little scatter-brained giving me shades of our last visit.  The food was decent.  I really do appreciate the gift card and the chance to experience Pan again.  I'm not sure if I'll be clamoring to return for a third time but I think they've gotten their act together more since opening.  Aside from the that, I'll probably stick to Tram's for Pho, but I still recommend trying Pan for yourself."}
{"text":"The label of Chinese food is misleading. I cannot eat Thai and some Chnese due to chili and Cayenne use. I was stuck with an appetizer for dinner. The Chicken wrap was cooked with a lot of filler, so it was far from what I was looking for to sate my cravings."}
{"text":"Came for a Monday night dinner, and in retrospect I'm pretty surprised by the 4.5-star rating. 4 at best, 3.5-star experience for us.  If you come at night, the ambience is glaringly lit with fluorescents. This is a typical hole-in-the-wall asian eatery, lacking decor and using paper menus.   Service is a bit overly attentive and with a smile, and it's not to their discredit but I don't think they understood anything we said. We received the wrong check, but got our water refreshed every 3 minutes, which was necessary with how FRICKIN HOT their food is.   I ordered the Beef Rice Noodle \"Pho\" bowl ($8), and my boyfriend got the Massaman curry ($10). When asked if we wanted it hot (which we can usually handle in restaurants that practice humanitarianism) we said \"medium,\" thinking we'd get something palatably spicy but not \"hot.\"   I couldn't physically eat my meal, as it was laced with so much chili oil that my throat literally felt like it was bleeding and my lips were swelling up. My boyfriend went through multiple napkins for nose-blowing, excused himself for the restroom, and continued blowing his nose. I drank at least 2 liters of ice water during my meal. We swapped meals halfway through to diversify the flavor-pain experience.   For the good of your clientele, if a Caucasian person asks for \"medium,\" just nod and give them \"mild.\" Or explain the impending doom that's about to occur. Anything, please. Please god.   Why three stars? I could tell that underneath all the chili oil that the food was actually very tasty. In the moments where I wasn't thinking about running into traffic, the meal was actually very enjoyable. I would return, with a strict MILD ONLY PLEASE, and probably have a better time."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is across the street from my house!! The chicken pad thai is soo delish and the lettuce wraps. They have lunch specials for only about 6 bucks and it comes with a drink. The place isn't very big maybe 6-8 tables, but it's clean and I can see right into the kitchen which is a HUGE bonus in my book. It kinda freaks me out when I cant see what the cook looks like or how my food is cooked. The owner is super friendly and jokes that he needs more business to hire a dish washer because he is tired of washing them himself LOL Great food good prices and super friendly service = an A+ in my book."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a few weeks back. We were there for happy hour on a Thursday and it was very pleasant and not crowded. The head bartender and head chef both came out to say hello. The food was very good and the drinks were exceptional. The rolls were a good fusion. Not your typical sushi. We can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Omg! Acabamos de comer en Pan Asían y estuvo fantástico! Ordenamos la ensalada de mango, phad tai y wanton soup, los tres platillos excelentes, buenas porciones y el sabor inigualable, creo que es el mejor phad thai que he comido en mi vida; los meseros y todo el personal muy amables. Recomendadisimo! No dejen de venir!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! I recommend starting with the  year of the mule cocktail...very tasty. The dumplings and tempura shrimp are great starters but my hat is off to the edamame...the truffle soy makes this an incredible dish. The drunken noodle bowl was also very good. The staff is friendly and service was wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"It had been a lonnngggg time between first discovering Pan Asian a few years ago on a date, and my last visit. Clearly too long. Used to order lunch WITH my Physical Therapy office. These were Pre-Yelp days for me. Apparently, barring spice level (a hard 8 is how I roll) my favorite dish: Massaman Curry with Soft Tofu is Misti's favorite dish and owner David was sure I was some under cover Yelper (when I'd never heard of Yelp!) It made for funny exchanges for a long time. David is quite a congenial character and cares about his business.   Definitive of  a Mom and Pop spot in every way; with a  small open kitchen where David's wife Lisa cooks up a storm. The fantastic aromas that fill the air are intoxicating. The owners are very friendly, passionate and if you've been to Thailand, Lisa loves to discuss regional food and travel. Luckily that led them to trust pale moi when I order a True Thai 8 level spice; many places take a gander at me and knock the spice level down. Not here!   The food is made with the same love that goes into running such a business, most of the time, David is your server. Small, no ambiance really. But Oh. That. Food. Three people can share a small feast for $10 or under if you eat family style. Since my bros would not TOUCH spice level 8 = I had enough take away for two more meals. Now that's delicious, nutritious and value packed eating! The Green Papaya Salad, Crying Tiger Salad, Drunken Noodles, Basil Rice are all standout dishes as well. Lisa will prepare any dish according to dietary restrictions/preferences.   It is on Durango in a non descript Strip Mall, near the now closed (again) Carmine's. Very easy to pass. Between Sahara and Desert Inn, the sign says \"David Wong's Pan Asian\" and faces the car park NOT Durango. I got lost going: but always get lost and was working on a three day insomnia hell. Just look out for it, and by all means: GO! You will not be sorry. Great to see such a true family business thrive: very Yelpy.   Yelp 100 Challenge"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean. The counter server is super friendly and helpful.  The food was not so good.Very overpriced.  We ordered 5 dishes plus appetizers.  Noodles were over cooked,gluey blobs. The chicken was tough. The pork fried rice was so so but it lacked flavor.  We typically go to Bobo which is DELICIOUS but it was closed yesterday so we decided to try Pan Asia. Never again."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried rice, Pho , drunken noodles and  sweet and sour chicken. It was so good and flavorful, you had the option to pick your spice level and it was spot on. The only thing I didn't like was the sweet and sour chicken. It tasted like they used to motor sauce and it just didn't taste right. Other than that the food was great. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Got my wife addicted to his pad Thai after eating it myself. David is a friendly person and the way owners should be to customer's nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Ding ding ding, we have a winner folks!  First of all, thanks to Misti and the crew for finding yet another gem.  This place advertises itself as an Asian fusion restaurant, but at its core it is a gourmet, mostly authentic Thai restaurant.  And you know how I love Thai food...  We ordered the Massaman Curry with beef, the Rad Nah with pork, and the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli.  After eating these, I am convinced that this is one of the top three Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, maybe top two!  (UPDATE: This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas currently).  The Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli were quite interesting as an appetizer.  The presentation was very gourmet and beautiful.  The ravioli noodles were soft and sticky, wrapped in a shrimp that's cooked in interesting spices.  The flavor was perfect with a little bit of red chili sauce on it (I skipped the soy sauce that came with it).  Not Thai, I know, but definitely yummy.  I am not really a fan of Massaman because it tends to be sweet, but with all of the talk about it here, I thought I would try it.  This version was sweet, as it is supposed to be, but it also had a ridiculously intriguing and complex flavor!  There was a definite peanut flavor, but also another flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  The chef makes her own curries, so I attribute this complex flavor to the homemade curry sauce.  I probably would order this with less sweetness next time, but this dish was amazing.  It came with big potato slices, carrots cooked to perfection, bell peppers, and beef chunks that were nicely prepared.    The Rad Nah here is extremely good, and won me over.  This is probably tied for the second best Rad Nah I have had!  The cook said that it was one of her favorite dishes, and so she takes a lot of pride in her recipe.  This dish smelled absolutely amazing.  Smokey, lightly sweet aromas.  The taste was just as good.  The pork was nice and juicy, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and crunchy.  The sauce was slightly more rich than the other two great Rad Nah recipes I have had, which gave it its own character.  Not a lot of places can make a great Rad Nah, and Pan Asian makes one of the best I have had.  Great job, Pan Asian.  I am so glad to have this restaurant available in Las Vegas.  I will have to take some breaks from my usual spots to explore their menu some more.  The Thai food is mostly authentic, but they do have to Americanize certain dishes a little bit.  So, if you want the real deal, just order it \"Thai style\".  We rattled off a few exotic dishes that we like, and the chef said that some of them she can cook very well (very spicy Pa Cha).  I can't wait to go back!  Edit: I've been back a number of times and have loved every dish I have had (roast duck, red snapper).  One dish really stood out yesterday though, the red curry.  I had it with beef, spicy level 10, and it came with fresh peppers and pieces of pumpkin!  It wasn't as sweet as the other curries, so you non-sweet curry lovers will enjoy this one!  The sauce is homemade, and full of fresh flavors.  I believe that it may be the best red curry I have ever had.  Dave said that this is how the royal family eats red curry.  I don't know about royalty, but if this dish isn't fit for it than I don't know what is!  Second Edit: recommended dishes for Thai food lovers, may not be on the menu: the Red Curry dishes (served with fresh pumpkin!), Pa Cha with tilapia, Red Snapper, Duck curry, fried banana."}
{"text":"Well tried this on a whim.  The description says Japanese, Chinese and Thai. The only thing Japanese was the gyozas. It's prodominatly Thai. So don't come here thinking they have anything Japanese or Chinese.  The place was small so not great for large groups. They had portable heaters to heat the dining area. Not very classy but you do what you gotta do. The food was good. The fried calamari was ok, they could of used fresher oil. The Vietnamese shrimp ravioli were awesome. Very fresh and had a real good flavor. The drunken noodles were definitely drunk in oil.  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come here again but if I'm in the area it may be considered. The chef were very friendly and they had their regulars.  All in all it wasn't a bad first visit."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem that is family owned and run. We came once YEARS ago and had an excellent experience. Unfortunately, we moved much further South and wasn't as nearby anymore. On Valentines Day, after a morning filled with Pokémon Leagues & Gymnastics, we ended up here with our 2 crazy kids around 2PM. It was surprisingly full considering the time and our server seated us very promptly. We went kind of crazy on the ordering considered there were only 2 adults & 2 children (8 & 4) but we definitely left extremely stuffed.  We started with the Malaysian Roti with curry & crunchy shrimp spring rolls (per the request of my son). The Malaysian Roti was great! Puffy, fried roti with a wonderful curry that had just the right amount of seasoning. We will certainly order this again. The spring rolls were typical egg rolls IMO served with lettuce & sweet & spicy sauce. Onto the entrees! We got: drunken noodles, panang curry, crying tiger salad, & basil fried rice that had shrimp & chicken. Everything was excellent. My favorite was probably the crying tiger salad with its tender fall apart beef. I think what makes this place stand out is that they cook their proteins PERFECTLY. Barely anything has to be chewed because they all fall apart in your mouth. I wish their panang was slightly thicker, but the flavors were excellent anyway. Their basil fried rice had a bunch of basil leaves in it (my favorite herb) and made me happy. Drunken noodles had plenty of veggies which is just the way I like it.   For dessert - fried cheesecake & mango sticky rice. Both were typical but still delicious. Overall, come try this hole in the wall Thai restaurant. You won't be disappointed with its cozy interior and family run service."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! I am kicking myself right now for not reading the most recent reviews of this place! They all agree with me, appalling taste and upsetting execution.  How is it possible that every single dish we ordered tonight was an awful and tasteless disaster! They must of hired a new chef. That's the only explanation for this. Pan Asian, how do you go from having a near perfect review on yelp and start to slip this drastically? Everything was beyond unacceptable. You have been checked off on my list of the worst thai food I have ever had in my life.  First offense: The chicken pad thai was an unnatural pink? The chicken looked like dried overcooked salmon - it was pink! The noodles were beyond over cooked to the point where they were hard, all stuck together in blocks and then broke up into a million of little pieces when you would try to pick them up. There was no sauce at all, not even soaked into the pad thai noodles. It was so dry! So crazy dry. There was no flavor at all - not even a hint of fish sauce, sweetness, sourness, or anything!   Second offense: The pad see ew with beef noodles were also stuck together like bricks, dried out and hard. Also, why did the only flavor we taste was oil and extra black pepper? Did they run out of oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, sugar, fish sauce, all of the traditional ingredients that go into this dish? I could not handle eating oil flavored noodles with extreme black pepper. Into the trash it goes.   Third offense: The green curry with beef had the consistency of tom yum soup. I don't understand how they can make a curry so watery! I did not taste any of the deep flavors you would typically find in curry, (no lemongrass, no richness, no sweetness) except for spicy. Spicy water would best explain this dish. To add insult to injury, they offered us a minimal amount of chewy beef pieces and loaded up on undercooked and hard vegetables. Cutting costs much?  What upsets me the most, was that the owner David Wong was there and he allowed these dishes to be served to us. That was his stamp of negligence. There is no quality or control here.   We ate 4 bites and could not get past how incredibly shoddy all of these dishes were prepared. I'm seriously upset that we spent$40 on all of this dried out, bland food. The joke is on us. I would typically give restaurants a second chance. But not this place, never again."}
{"text":"I had the basil chicken level 5 and chicken lettuce wraps.  Next time I'll go down a spice on the basil chicken.  Excellent spices and very fresh ingredients.  Nobody does the chicken lettuce cups like Pan Asian.  Even though this was a to go order, the presentation is always beautiful- thank you Mr Wong and family!"}
{"text":"After a busy day of shopping, we had the hankering for Thai.  I pulled up my handy dandy Yelp app and saw this place had very good reviews.  We looked at a picture of the menu and decided on the Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and the Green Curry w/ Shrimp.  We placed our order over the phone as we wanted to utilize takeout and enjoy the meal from home.  I'm not sure if this altered the quality of the meal, but I think it has to.  I've NEVER had good Pad Thai takeout and this experience was no different.  Upon my arrival at home (10 minute drive), I opened the Pad Thai and it had a gelatinous casing like it was last night's Pad Thai.  I would have taken a picture but I don't think Takeout orders do justice for any establishment.  The Green Curry was OK, but they must be on the metric system w/ a high multiple as we ordered each dish w/ a \"2\" spice level.  They must have thought I said 20 because I was sweating after four bites of Pad Thai and a spoonful of Curry.    The Pineapple Fried Rice was the standout (in a good way) as the sweetness of the raisins and pineapple went well w/ the rice and the overall cook on the rice was on point.    The Green Curry was too spicy and overall was just OK.  I'm not sure if I would come back or not."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing, we often order and pick up our food, however this time we decided to dine in and again it was an amazing experience, Paola was our waitress and she was great, friendly, came to our table a number of times, I would highly recommend this restaurant however #5 was a bit spicy and it goes up to 10,"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I really do wish this place had warm yellow light, some piped in music (the 1 TV is muted), something to break the stark black and quiet.  But the owner compensates with his sincere and humorous service.  This time we tried the pork spare ribs with XO sauce.  It was very good and man, the bok choy veggies at the bottom were EXCELLENT!  I would eat this over Brussels sprouts any time!  The cheesecake tempura my husband adored as is.  Personally I would like it without the coating.  It's a good cheesecake, and goes well a la mode.  I was quite disappointed with the pad thai though. I remember it to be a lot... yummier.  Dunno what happened.  I've had better around Vegas. -------- The place is quite small and bare, wish it had a little more warmth (maybe they should change the white lighting)...but the food rocks, and is presented beautifully.  The best phad Thai I've had in Vegas so far.  The owner is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Good food, first time ordered and delivery was prompt. Thai spicy chicken salad was really great.  Will order from them again. Great things was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack, some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  And mad props to the only guy who was working that day (big game so very few customers out that day) for serving me and the few other guests like a boss.  He was cooking as fast as he could and tending the bar perfectly at the same time."}
{"text":"Super good food! Everything was delicious!  I got the Panang and it was delicious and my bc got the dw fried rice and they were both delicious!   Spicy level : be cautious I usually get a 8 on 1-10 scale or 4 on 1-5 scale at other Thai or Aisian restaurants however they have a 1-10 scale and they warned me that it would be spicy but I didn't know the extend! I ordered a 5 and I could barely finish the dish and I love spicy food!"}
{"text":"Wow the food here is really good. I dare say this is the best Asian restaurant I've found on the west side. My girlfriend and I loved this place. She couldn't stop saying how good the Pad Thai was. Looks like we'll be regular customers now. Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in the city. The flavor of the food here is amazing. For the amount and quality of food this Resturant is an incredible value"}
{"text":"i had came to vegas for a little trip and found this little place cause i was craving some thai food. and i got my fix. food was delicious and cheap"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food after work so I ordered pork Pad See Eew for pick up. I have been wanting to try this place because of their high ratings. I was not disappointed. It was one of the best Pad See Eew dishes I've had. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"THIS IS OUR FAVORITE PLACE FOR BOAT NOODLE!!!! yes.. this phrase has to be in caps! We are very close and I honestly felt like I was missing out all these years of being in Vegas!  We haven't tried everything on the menu but the Boat Noodle and the Grilled Squid Salad is now my 2 favorite items so far!! the broth is always HOT (very important) and the kick of the Spices is just perfect!! and who doesn't like grilled squid?? Most importantly, Chef David is just always pleasant to be around with!  you'll see us there on Tuesdays at least once a month!!"}
{"text":"I just stopped by this PAN while riding my bike and had sushi AND SAKE. The service was great and the fresh salmon roll was delicious!!  I will be back to try other food items on the menu.   They do need to expand their SAKE offering and add Sapporo light or Kirin light to the beer offering."}
{"text":"Pan Asian. Which means go spicy or go home!  Me and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant.   After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!  Now im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?  As for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!  The only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied."}
{"text":"Too Americanized for my taste.  Limited menu.  Portions are tiny.  Quality of food is a bit above average, but only a little bit.  We must have tried about 10 different dishes and it was disappointing.  It is located pretty far from the strip.  I imagine this kind of food in Beverly Hills or at a restaurant in a mid level casino--again, you know, a bit too Americanized."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove past it the other day and decided to try it out. We love any kind of Asian food and are pleased to have a new place to go close to the house. When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car there and we were not sure they were open, even though the sign said they were. We tried the door and were greeted my David( the owner) with a warm hello. He welcomed us and told us about how he came here from Naples Florida and just opened a month ago. He assured us we would love our meal and he was right. He made a couple of suggestion and we settled on starting with the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli. We watched Lisa, David's wife and a wonderful chef, prepare the appetizer from our table. It is nice to see an open kitchen where you can watch everything being freshly made. For dinner I had the Red Nah noodles and my wife had the Massaman Curry. Both were outstanding, although I have to take my wife's word on the curry since I don't enjoy curry. The portions were good size and we even had a little left to take home. My only trepidation about writing this review is that Pan Asian is a small restaurant with only about 14 seats and I don't want to always have to wait in line for my new favorite local place. My other recommendation to David was for him t o make sure that Lisa's name goes on the name of the place as well since her food is the real star of the show."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite little Thai place in Vegas. My family and I have been coming here for so long that the owner Dave knows our order! He is always so friendly and warm. The food is consistently delicious and fresh every time. I rotate between the sweet and sour chicken or the garlic pepper chicken and veggie fried rice. Be warned of the spice rating here, a level 10 is REALLY hot. My brother who is a spice fanatic has actually requested a level 20 dish which Dave accommodated! I don't know how he ate it but he ate the whole thing. Everything I have tried has been tasty here, from the gzoya, the Malaysian curry, to the chicken satay. Yum!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for us!! Clean, great service & food. David and staff are top shelf. Where else can you go today where the cook wears gloves and a mask?  Incredible David!"}
{"text":"Good portions OK prices. Ordered take out garlic chicken was plated on plenty bochoy. The shrimp fried rice had great flavor however it only contained 3 skrimps truthfully it's like a curb your enthusiasm episode I once saw. The chicken pad tai I ordered solid, but I do prefer the wider noodles like my fav spot in shwarz bay Vancouver isle uses not the clear kind."}
{"text":"This place was great Asian fusion. I had the miso soup and the chicken pad thai. I actually ordered the tofu pad thai but I'm not a vegetarian so I did not complain when the chicken landed in front of me. I ordered it \"spicy 3/10\" and it had just the right kick. Enough to make my nose run, not enough to blow my head off. Fully planned on getting the cheesecake tempura but was so stuffed from dinner I just couldn't do it. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"They use very minimum meat in their dishes. I got the drunken noodles and it had PLENTY noodles with like five  small pieces of meat. I do recommend their filet mignon soup!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. But the name of the restaurant is a little misleading. The primary Asian style is Thai which is really well done.   I think this is a family run business and they are pretty efficient.  The restaurant can hold maybe a couple dozen people?    I tried the drunken noodles with beef, wife had curried vegetables, mom had ginger beef stir fry, and dad had clear noodle stir fry. Kids shared chicken fried rice with pineapple. Had the green papaya salad, shrimp egg rolls, and a Tom Yum soup all of which ran $85.   Clean bathrooms.   Food came out relatively fast considering the quality of the food is so good they are doing quite a bit of it from scratch. Food was very flavorful.   Service was friendly.   Will definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"No wonder 400+ reviews and at almost 5 stars. Amazing delicious food! Great prices. Very clean restaurant. Awesome customer service! Family ran. Perfect Valentine's Day dinner!!! I definitely would recommend Basil Sauce ground pork, mild spicy at 3. Miso soup was to perfection! Masaman curry was so delicious, try it at 3 cus 4 was already spicy hot. Lol. Loved the experience, I am glad we found this cozy place!!!"}
{"text":"We're back in Vegas for the WCC basketball tournament, and like last year have lunched here three times. The owner, staff, and food are all great. I would come to LV just to eat here. We love U Pan Asian"}
{"text":"I will never return to this restaurant any more. Last week, my friend and I went there. It's a bit busy, not very bad.  There were still 2 tables vacant. We entered and stood by the entrance. The waitress raised her eyes and looked at us several times.  She never greeted us or said anything.  We stood there for 8 minutes and decided to leave.  I never encountered any waitress as rude as this one.  Believe me, I eat out almost every day. I know the difference among the good, the bad and the horrible experience."}
{"text":"I find that I imagine eating here on a regular basis. The food is that delicious. David is highly personable and makes it fun to eat there.  Jokes like \"My wife is very angry today - food will be very spicy\" - classic stuff and I love it."}
{"text":"Thank you for the Fast Delivery Service! I ordered the Filet Mignon Pho soup but it was smaller than the advertised picture. The mango salad was great."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! We decided to try this place on a Saturday night when my son and his wife were visiting me from Cali.   We were pleasantly surprised at both the service and the food.  After reading the other Yelp reviews,  we were expecting a little larger eating area but it was actually just the right amount of seating. The server was knowledgeable and helpful.  Everything we ordered was excellent! We ate family style, and all the dishes went together perfectly, even tho we didn't plan it that way! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken pad Thai I've ever had! I've only ever ordered to go, but the dining room is cozy and quaint. My food is always amazing and I usually top it off with their fried cheesecake because duh! Staff is very helpful and pleasant. My go to Thai food spot!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.   Far from the strip. Small servings with more veggies than the meat.  Great service though."}
{"text":"This place is totally legit. If u want flavorful food this is it. I love spicy food, but the 5 outa 10 is enuff for me, caution on going higher. Their fried rice, pad sew ew, is super tasty. I wish they had some bigger shrimp w tail off but their pricing is legit w what they r serving. Everything i have ever had here is good. Love the Roti, satay, the pad thai is a little different than the pad thai than im used too but maybe this is authentic, not sure, but it is still good. I used bitesquad for delivery, it was really fast and the food was still hot."}
{"text":"First and foremost. Best restaurant experience I have had in Pittsburgh since moving here back in August.   Girlfriend and I went there last Saturday and absolutely loved it. I highly encourage people to sit in front of the cooks. They are extremely knowledgeable of the menu, and don't just recommend the most expensive item.   The executive chief was also really friendly, even gave us a free roll.   I again RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO EVERYONE.   #drunkinnoodles. #bestresturant."}
{"text":"Spent a happy hour on the patio and the drinks, food, and service were fantastic!  All around we had a wonderful experience the food was so flavorful! We ordered the spicy tuna roll (only $4 during happy hour!) to start then had their chang mai chicken plate and the special bowl I believe it was pork belly the house reed curry and bok choy. YUM! there were such great flavors in the food without any overwhelming heat. Since it was happy hour we two of the diamond vodka special drinks, peppered diamond and sparkling diamond, and they were both delicious!   On top of great food and great drinks our server(Christina maybe?) was so wonderful! Perfectly attentive and answered all of questions! We will definitely be back soon! Can't wait to try out the Brunch Menu!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been to the restaurant and also done take out and also delivery using GrubHub.  When I ordered for delivery the food came in about 45-50 min. Good portion & delivered pretty hot for around $4 delivery charge and an additional tip. Worth it if you can't get away for lunch or dinner and want good fast food.   I've tried the mango salad (total yum) the drunken noodles, the pad sewee with chicken (super yum) Vietnamese spring rolls (pass on this one next time)  Singapore noodles (tasty)   All of the food is excellent except I would not order the spring rolls again. I think for around $7.95 for 4 small spring rolls it is not worth it. They are not any better than most Chinese restaurants that give them for free.   Fresh food which seems relatively healthy ! Hard to beat  P.S. they need to update their to-go order menu as it doesn't list the \"Volcano chicken\"which I would like to try out :)"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. The guy who owns it is super nice."}
{"text":"All the salads and soups are excellent, I drive across town for this one.  The little sweet lady that owns and cooks here is a doll."}
{"text":"I went there since I didn't wanted to do mac d since i was not finding any deal under my budget of $ 6-$7. I actually had my lunch in  Retail outlets which was fab food and healthy with veggies and rice at $6 i guess. I didn't order to go considering i will get something at the strip at dinner time. However i guess i should have picked from there. Here i paid $9.67, not good food, with very less vegetables and less portions.I was better of doing junk at Mac D's opposite Caesars Forum Shops."}
{"text":"I ordered extra rice and I got a half of scoop for $1.50, the salad spilled the sauce all over the rest of the food and smells like feet. I've ordered delivery a few times from here but this will be the last."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving some chinese food, so I looked on yelp, and I was shocked from all of the 5 star reviews this place has considering that it's right by my house, and I've never heard of it.   We had the Vietnamese chicken ravioli for an appetizer, and they were delicious. I especially loved the sauce that you dip the ravioli in to. I will definitely be ordering these next time I go!  I ordered the Pad See-Yew with beef at a 5/10 spice level. For me, I thought this was supposed to be medium, but it wasn't spicy enough. Luckily, they bought over 3 different kinds of chili sauces and spices to sprinkle onto my food to make it spicier. Much better! The beef was cooked perfectly, and so were the noodles. The combination of the hot beef, and salty noodles is one that can't be missed!   My boyfriend ordered the Stir Fried Linguine with Beef. I know it's really odd for an Asian restaurant to offer linguine, but it was great. The noodles were cooked perfectly in combination with all of the vegetables. From what I tasted, it was a great dish.  I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Overall, Excellent ... Eat 24 Delivery experience was great. The driver arrived a minute or 2 early. He was friendly & very professional.   Entrees - fresh and plentiful. Flavor - perfect.   My entree - Filet Mignon Pho Soup (with medium spice). Comforting with a nice kick. While my soup was cooling off, I took the meat out and cut it into smaller pieces (just a personal preference).   I also ordered a Thai Coffee since it was a brunchy lunch for the hubby and I. Sweeter than I expected (which is not what I normally prefer) but offered balance to my somewhat spicy soup. It turned out to be a nice treat :)  Hub and I split the Pineapple Fried Rice (mild) with chicken & shrimp, which were the right texture, flavor and size.   His entree - Drunken Noodles - medium - with added chicken. Large portion with nice flavor & texture. I ate some of the veggies. Fresh and not over-cooked.   We wanted to give the Thai Donuts a try since it added to the brunchy feel. They could've been cooked a tiny bit longer but that'll just give us reason to them put them in the oven later since the entrees were so filling. We'll definitely have enough of everything for 2 more meals. The donuts didn't affect my rating for our overall experience."}
{"text":"I sort of had trouble finding this place.  It's tucked away in a corner and the sign is sooooo nondescript I passed by it TWICE.  There is no visual at all on the sign, and the font for \"Pan Asian is so default I thought it was for a tax or accounting company.  Thankfully, the food is everything but nondescript.  I have to say it was one of the better fusion restaurants I have been to.  I always feel nervous going to an All Asian restuarant because it seems none of the dishes are made right.  However, every single dish I had today was very good.  I had some crunchy pancake thing (I think it was called lati?) and the pad thai was pretty good.  I always order pad thai from thai restauarants and this place got it right, although the chicken was sliced a little too big.  PS. the desert was delicious.  Terri got this fancy fried cheesecake ice cream thingy and she shared it with everyone (happy birthday Terri!!).  I wish it wasn't so far from my house and I would definitely visit it more.  It's not a WOWzer restaurant or anything, but I had a good experience with the food.  Plus the old man working there is friendly and very funny.  I loved the service."}
{"text":"There are many choices of great Thai restaurants in Vegas, but after yoga while in casual clothing...it feels as if we are going home to eat a home-cooked meal when we sit down at David Wong's Pan Asian.  Shrimp ravioli, mango salad with grilled prawns and drunken noodles are some of our favorites when my love and I dine here, but today we had chicken noodle soup and masaman chicken curry.  The chicken noodle soup reminds me of Pho--clear broth with bean sprouts and cilantro with spicy level 4 to share...I normally get 13 on a scale of 1 through 10...I made mine to my liking by putting some spices from their spicy tray, perfectly heated for this spice-craving-girl.   Jolene has been our server most of our visits at Pan Asian...she is prompt in her service and kind...often leading a friendly conversation, checking on our needs and filling up our glasses.  The most attractive part of interior is the open kitchen...so you could see David, his wife, and their crews' dynamic energy, while taking in the aroma they create directly to our senses.   Bring your appetite to David Wong's Pan Asian and and let them satisfy your Thai food cravings."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've eaten at Pan Asian, once in Summer 2015 and now again during Thanksgiving week 2015. We've owned a 2nd home in Summerlin since 2001 and have finally found a good Thai restaurant that is local, has good quality, has excellent ingredients, and is a family operation. We've had the Shrimp Soup, Curry Dishes, Stir Fry Dishes, Noodle Dishes, and Pad Thai ... all were excellent. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"YUMMITY-YUM!  Small place that is run by super nice folks! I went as part of a huge group.... NOTE... not really a place that can do huge groups (12+) but they pulled it off.  Food:  Massaman Curry...Wow! I'm not a curry fan.... but this one.... Yea Baby! Would never think that Avocado would go in a curry... but it was Great!  Pad See Ew... Could have continued eating this even after I exploded.... So Good!   Papaya Salad.... I tried my friend's dish... I have no idea what number of hot she ordered... but this had a nice kick.  It was cool and fresh and then BAM the spice sneaks up on you... but I went back for a couple more bites.    Hotness Rating:  I like a bit of spice/heat... but not too much... I actually like to taste the food I'm eating and not just hot spice.  So our Massaman Curry and Pad See Ew dishes were 1.... but I would have preferred to bump it up a step to 2.... but not too much more than that.... for me anyways.  They scale their dishes 1 to 10. My other friend ordered a 3 on a veggie stir fry dish... and she was visibly sweating and she was LOVING the food. I don't know if she sweats easy... but she really enjoyed it and said it was \"hot\" but that it was perfect... so my guess is their 3 is more like a 5 or 6 other places.  So, I can only assume that their 10 is off the charts.  Price: Very Reasonable.... about $10/pp for an entree and drink  Notes: Good Parking In a little strip mall Doesn't serve alcohol"}
{"text":"Arrived at PAN for dinner during a weeknight. The place was largely empty, although it did fill up a bit as we ate a leisurely meal. Our server was very friendly, a big fan of the restaurant, and super informed about the dishes offered. We were advised to order in \"waves,\" and that worked out well, enabling us to eat just as much as we were comfortable with and to share all of our dishes.  The dumplings weren't a huge stand-out. Your normal room temperature, pork & cabbage mixture. Wrappers were on the loose side and most of them came apart before the chopsticks made it to our mouths. Our server recommended the Key-Lime Scallop, and though we were super worried by the name, the dish was pleasantly temperate in the combination of its sweetness and acidity. The other rolls (peppered tuna and angry snapper) were ok--nothing dramatically amazing, but all the ingredients worked. Like their predecessor, Tamari, they seem to definitely be on the More-is-More side of the sushi business with these rolls and their plentiful ingredients/sauces.   We definitely had some issues with the knife-work on the very thick nigiri and the balance of vegetables/sauce to fish was overpowering. It was really hard to really taste the unique flavor of the fish (which is what good sushi is about, yeah?) and the texture of the thick slices was somewhat unappealing. A good example was the Yellowtail with a very strong pear and ginger slaw AND a heavy eel sauce that completely hid the nuance of the \"orange zest\" and the fish itself. Still, the White Tuna nigiri was our favorite dish of the night, with the watercress and yuzu subtle enough to allow the flavor of the fish to show up.  We also enjoyed the black cod and the fried shrimp, although these are two classic items on Umi's omikase menu and PAN's versions are nowhere in the same class. Still, as budget versions, they were pretty tasty. The sablefish was tender and flavorful and the shrimp were on the spicy side, with a light fry.   We found both the cocktails and desserts a bit mystifying. The balance and thoughtfulness of the cocktails was significantly off. In each one I tried, there was one ingredient overpowering the drink. Made me glad I ordered wine for myself while my dining partners had to slog through to finish their drinks. The bizarre avocado creme-brulee thing really wasn't anything special/didn't taste any different than your average, slightly-grainy restaurant offering.   Pricing was pretty good for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Oh yes, it is true, I have found a new favorite Thai place. And yes I will drive back to the complete other side of town for this spice again, and again, and again.  I was dining solo, and on Durango so I figured  would take my fellow Elite yelper Shawn's recommendation for Thai. I walked into Pan Asian and was greeted and told to sit anywhere. As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and \"their spice level\". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5.  If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said \"here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai\" I simply looked back, smiled, and said \"GOOD.\" When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now!  It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES.  I love being the white girl who impresses the old Thai people. When my guy came to check on me he asked if it was too spicy, I told him it indeed was spicy, but perfectly spicy.  It's about time there is a place I can brag about to my friends when they want a real heat level. Good quality Thai food, and great service. I can't wait to return and try something else!!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of Asian selections available for such a small restaurant. However there seems to be only one person working as a server so the service slow. We ordered the chicken panang curry, pad thai, and beef pho. Although delicious, it was very salty and we had to order a bowl of rice. The flavors are very unique and differentiated from other Asian restaurants that I am used to. Perhaps next time I will ask them to cut back on the salt. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Love it here! Went here with my bf for my first time 2 weeks ago and I just had to come back. Came here a few days ago and again it was awesome.  Great service and food. I highly recommend the drunken noodles or any stir fry dish. Our server was so sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE. The drunken noodles are amazing. I've gone for the past 3 Thursdays in a row. It's my new meal on Thursdays! Lol...I've only had one issue. One of the girls who took my order was rude and I didn't like her at all. But since the food is so good I will still give it a 5. Plus the owner is so sweet and nice."}
{"text":"You may think this place is good, but no it's not. Me and my cousin wanted to try another new restaurant around this area. We thought since this restaurant was famous and had famous asian chefs making food, we might as well try this restaurant.  When we came in, the place only had one server. There were mostly people phone ordered and picked up. We thought hmm... We tried many different variety of food but none of them satisfied us. We didn't even see the famous chefs, only other employees making the food.  Don't come here, try somewhere else. This place will make you very upset due to UNDELICIOUS food and SLOW service including food coming out and server."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal at Pan. I had the drunken noodle bowl and the kuro buta belly. Both we're amazing but the purées that came with the pork belly were truly memorable. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Pan Asian about 15+ times, and have taken several friends here.   I give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good. How anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me. I am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants. Pan Asian is up there of one of my all time favorites. How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about.   I give the space and decor 4/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal, but it works.   Miso Soup, Massaman Curry, Basil Fried Rice, and a Thai Iced Tea  is my fav at the moment and what I wish I was eating right now..."}
{"text":"If Yelp had awards for Best New Restaurants, this would make the list!  It says Pan Asian (Chinese, Thai, Japanese) but it's mainly Thai with some Malaysian IMO with some hints from other asian fares.  First off, the owners here are amazing.  David and Chef Lisa really provide a comforting, intimate experience you woulnd't get at an asian place.    We ordered the following:  Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli  Pad-See Ew Massamam Curry Crying Beef Salad Tom Yum Shrimp Tempura Cheesecake  The Crying Beef Salad was the best!  The beef was cooked perfectly and the greens had so much flavor.  Everything was delicious but I must say that I've had better Tom Yum at many other places.  This place only has a few tables and as this builds more Yelp cred, they will need to expand to counter the herds of people lining up.  Best of all, everything is under 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"Sick for the umpteenth time in the last 4 months, so it called for some spicy soup. My brother was ordering some for my niece from this place and I decided to get it on it, too. I'm so very glad I did!  I ordered the same as my niece, Tom Yum Goong with extra shrimp, spicy level 3, with a side of white rice. Ordered my husband some chicken pad Thai, spicy level 2.   This was, hands down, the BEST tom yum Goong soup I have ever had! Fresh and super spicy, full of flavor! Made me sweat immediately (that's a good thing).   The pad Thai was also very delicious, full of flavor, and lots of veggies. I can't wait to take my husband here and have a nice sit down meal."}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop (and daughter) restaurant that serves some of the best Thai dishes I've ever had.  It's a small place, but they bust their asses to give you great service, even when it's busy. Some of the best things I've had: panang curry, yellow curry,  clear noodles, and the duck with red curry sauce. I can't wait to go back and try some non-curry dishes and some Vietnamese or Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"We walked in right as they opened and the smell that greeted us indicated they had been doing prep for a while. We started with the gyoza with 2 wonderful side sauces. My wife had a cold so ordered tea and miso soup which both had great flavor. We split a grilled tiger shrimp mango salad which had some wonderful and different flavors. We asked for it to be spiced up a little and the heat level was perfect. This is a wonderful locally owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is definitely worth returning to. The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. This is a hidden gem here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is definitely our new favorite Thai place in summerlin! It's a really small place but we came at 6 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. My husband got a basil chicken stir fry and I got chicken pad Thai, both at a level 6 which is what we get at every thai place we ever go to. WOW, definitely made a note for next time - the 6 felt like an 8!! Very spicy, so keep that in mind. Other than that, the food was super fresh and flavorful. Our server was so nice and attentive, we really liked her! Can't wait to come back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! This is simply amazing! The best Thai Food I've ever had! From the kind, friendly service to the amazingly delicious food this place is worth the visit! You can see this beautiful family working in the kitchen, freshly preparing every meal. The food is beautiful to look at, and the flavors are on point!!! It is the perfect balance of light flavors, Thai spices and fresh veggies! As a Thai food lover and having visited every place in LA I can tell you this place is for REAL! Thank you for guys for the love you put into your food I truly enjoyed it and I was glad to see you all again!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Pan Asian just for drinks. Thai iced tea perfect. Thai iced coffee so so. The coffee wasn't sweet and creamy enough and a little bitter. Preferred the tea."}
{"text":"Decided to go because of a groupon, and regretted it.   First off, the first waitress we had took the wrong order for our appetizer and we got the poutine instead of the shrimp, which we decided to just try the poutine instead. It was very salty with an overwhelming amount of cheese. Overall it did not fit our taste. Next, we got our main dishes. The drunken noodles were not bad. The flavor was pretty good, but bunch of the noodles were not completely cooked. The Korean chicken was dry and tough. The sides of the chicken were like jerky. The ganjang sauce had an odd flavor and did not suit my taste at all. The kimchi I got as a side tasted like basically large pieces of ginger. The two stars are for the second waitress who was very kind.   Overall, I don't think we'll be back here anytime soon. It is expensive and the food is not worth the price. If it weren't for the groupon, this would have been much worse."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. Lobster monkey roll was real good though. Staff was friendly and service was good. Food wasn't mind blowing but it got the job done. A little overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Very tasty, clean and reasonably priced (even if we hadn't had the Yelp coupon). We were literally the only two people in the place for lunch - that just gave the staff a chance to take great care of us, but without being obsessively attentive. The duck was delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant six or seven or eight stars  I would in a minute , in one word fantastic This is my first time here with my wife, and we were pleasantly surprised to find the small little restaurant to weigh in the corner just off of South Durango. The tastes and the selections of food do you get in this restaurant should be found in a five-star establishment David Wong's hand Asian is truly a hidden gem.   Adding to the review ...  3rd time back ( since last review.   Awesome !!!  Last visit, ordered drunken noodles at spicy 5 ..  Too hot...   This time Singapore noodles at 3 , very good.   One of our favorite places now"}
{"text":"I feel like I might be swimming against the current on this one, with so many great reviews of this place. I came he with my usual lunch crowd (we all work together) thus right off the bat we asked for separate checks and was told no problem. The special was volcano chicken so three of us ordered that and one ordered the yellow curry and the last ordered Chicken Pad Thai. Well the Volcano chicken was atrocious, it was sooooo overcooked I couldn't taste any chicken, I swear when I say it tasted like glazed pork rinds. My jaw hurt from crunching so much. Everyone that got the Volcano Chicken had the same issue. My friends Pad Thai came out pink?? And smelled and tasted like fish.. he took two bites and pushed it aside. When the check came they forgot to give us separate checks and a overcharge and refund later we finally got out of there.  Not sure if there was a new cook or the what, but this is one place that will not get a second chance from me, and I love Asian food."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.  First visit: Came here for dinner and ordered the duck curry on a yelper's recommendation. Absolutely love the duck curry. To quote another yelper, \"The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy.\" This is one dish that I tried on that yelper's recommendation and it was superb. LOVE IT! Just be careful with regards to the spice level. If you can't take spicy, go mild. I think I had mine at level 6 or 7 and it was somewhat burning my mouth. And I generally have my food spicy. So you've been warned.  Ps. The duck curry is not on their menu. You have to ask for this dish specifically. Remember to check with the staff on the price. I remember I was a little shocked when I saw the bill.  Second visit: Decide to come here and try out their lunch specials. Ordered the beef noodle soup (pho) and omg, bad decision. As we know, the broth is the backbone of any kind of noodle soup and my beef noodle soup was literally drowned in salt. I could feel the sodium kicking into my system and it did not go well with me at all. Other than the sodium laden broth, I honestly cannot remember anything else about my dish. My friends who ordered other dishes (I can't recall what their orders were now) were also complaining about their food, although i can't quite remember what their complaints were. Overall, none of us enjoyed our lunch experience that afternoon.   Service was good, and that's probably why I gave this place a 3-star. After my second visit, I think I am just going to have to stick to only my duck curry from now on. That is how traumatized I've become after having that beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"I think I just found my new favorite Thai place. At first glance it looks like a pizza take out joint instead but hole in walls can be the best sometimes. We ordered the pad see ew with only 1 level of spice. The noodle was a little wider than I'm used to and I thought that it could use a little more Chinese broccoli in it. Overall the food was delicious and very reasonable. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We walked in, not too busy. I ordered the drunken noodles because that's one of my favorite things to get. I ordered it Thai spicy! I could hear the cook and the server yelling at each other, the cook was asking her if I really wanted Thai spicy. The cook came out and asked if I was sure I wanted it that hot, I told him absolutely. We got our food and the first few bites were of course delicious, but then I started to feel the heat. I was sweating and in pain but it had such good flavor I couldn't stop eating. Next time I'll get it less spicy but I loved their drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants I've been too. Their food was absolutely delicious and spicy!! Also, the food was clean and healthy! Will definitely be coming back each time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"How many times you all think we can get a unicorn to high five a T-rex in outter space???  Let's make it happen!  I've had the opportunity to use Yelp's Eat 24 a few times.  Mainly for pick up orders.    But this time with Pan Asian I requested delivery.  My worry wart brain activated and wondered how hot my food would still hopefully be by the time it got delivered.  Especially cuz I'm in a gated complex where people sometimes wait to get in the gate.  Twiddled thumbs...  Food was delivered within 25 minutes of ordering which is not bad considering cooking time and a little over 2 miles away for delivery.  I expected such quality.  I can't assume a 4.5 star standing rating was only for dining in.  But because of the following, I'm really happy with: - they have pumpkin curry - rice is included with the dish ordered - food is delicious - they're close by - pricing is comparable in average to local Thai  - they have Yelp Eat 24 DELIVERY which arrived with edible hot delicious food  How good was it still?  The fried noodle stuffed egg rolls were crispy.  That's how good.  Pumpkin curry so yum.  I think I can handle medium spice next time.  The rice however had some hard pieces - the kind that stuck to my molars.  It's a 4.75****/  I'll try to dine in next meal, when I have more time."}
{"text":"I don't remember being so disappointed in a restaurant.  Not because the food or experience was so bad...but because all the reviews were so positive.  Perhaps my expectations were too high???  Let me start with the positive.  Service was very personal and very attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.    The food was mediocre at best.    Chicken Satay was not very flavorful.  The peanut sauce looked like it came from a bottle.  The Ravioli app was okay.  The wrap was good and the presentation was great, but the filling was over-processed and flavorless.  The Duck Curry was good.  The curry was a bit runny.    The ribs were probably the best thing we ordered.  The XO sauce was really good but I felt that the ribs were overcooked.    The beef salad was really bad.  Poor slices of beef...some cut with the grain and tough to chew.  The salad looked like the regular spring mix that you pick up at the market.    The basil fried rice was especially bad.  This is a dish we get at all Thai restaurants and the entree we use to compare restaurants.  Theirs is heavy on the soy sauce and not very deep with flavors.  We might try it for the lunch specials but unlikely that we would return for dinner."}
{"text":"This about the 4th time I have been here and their food is still consistently good.   Always have their tiger shrimp mango salad and the crispy duck curry. The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy. Its such a great dish. Although, really watch out their spicy level. When they ask you your spicy level, keep in mind they are thai standard spicy, not amrrican standard. Go level 3 if you want mild to medium, I had the level 5 and its burning me inside out. But i am still swallowing more food with my sweat. And the mango salad is a slightly cooked salad, which I love.  I would say avoid their tom yum soup, they are alright and serve in bowls then pot. And tried their pork rib, they are favourable but too meaty for me.   Overall it is a very good thai place out in the desert and even better than those in town. It is out off the strip but really worth going and to be away from the crowds and lines."}
{"text":"Best place ever love their pad Thai and their clear noodles!! Thai tea is awesome as well! Always friendly and nice as well"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and ordered Basil Chicken spicy level a 4. Not good"}
{"text":"My wife's coworker recommended this place so we tried it out on a Saturday evening. The place is small probably seats around 30. It's a quaint spot. We ordered some gyoza and basil fried rice. Wife got the chicken pho and I got the beef. Gyoza was pretty standard fair nothing out of the ordinary. The other dishes you can get tailored to your level spiciness 1 through 10. I can handle spicy food pretty well so me thinking 5 would be medium went for a 6 on my beef pho and a 5 for the fried rice. I guess I overestimated my spicy food macho-ness. Whooo boy it was spicy! My nose was running like crazy. Which is a shame because the pho was bomb! I wanted to drink up all the broth but couldn't handle the heat. Overall it was great food! We'll definitely be back. BUT we'll start off with 3's I think on the heat scale."}
{"text":"I am always in the market for trying a new Asian restaurant and I am pretty happy with my first Asian fusion experience at PAN.  First let me start by saying I love the outdoor eating area! There are lights strung up, multiple fountains, plants and heating lamps as well for your chilly spring days. It feels like you are in a garden. The inside did not disappoint either with its modern design and dimmed lighting. The bar area was rather big and there was also a little lounge like area with small round tables and lounge chairs. Oh and the music was on point, nothing like some 90s R&B!! Okay enough of the esthetically pleasing atmosphere talk, let's talk food!  I really enjoyed the menu for a couple of reasons. One of those reasons is because it was not very big but still packed with variety. I knew I wanted a noodle bowl so I decided to order the drunken noodles! I enjoyed this very much because it wasn't spicy, but it had a lot of flavor. Secondly if you are a sushi fan, be sure to find plenty of sushi options on the menu. I will say that the only downfall is that it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"We loved it. The negative reviews are a bummer because it was so good. Our faves: Gyoza: little dumplings with ponzu sauce and red chili sauce. Yum! Singapore noodles (with chicken): super-flavorful  Malaysian yellow curry: perfect balance of sweet and spice...veggies cooked perfectly Panang curry (my fave!!): the sweetness cuts into the spice. Green beans have never tasted so good. Fair warning, it is SPI-CAAAY! They let you pick 1-10, we went for five and it was really spicy. I can't fathom what ten would taste like."}
{"text":"After hearing all the good reviews and nice things from friends, we went there for dinner with a Yelp coupon. We ordered a crispy fried fish special and the green curry with duck special to share among two. The green curry was good with the duck, but nothing really amazed me, probably because we went in with high expectations. To give the place a chance to redeem itself, we ordered the fried ice cream but it arrived oily.  I'm disappointed but I'll be back to try other dishes Yelpers have been raving about to see if it's just me."}
{"text":"Nice local place very good pad Thai. Friendly service . If you like Thai food spiced the right way then this is the place"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've tried in Vegas! Fair price and super friendly staff. I always like to try the pad Thai in any Thai restaurant when I go for the first time and this is by far the best. The flavor is just right. None of that sweet sour super pink vinegar stinky \"pad Thai\" anyway the food is awesome here."}
{"text":"I was hopeful that this place would be good but I was very disappointed. I got the spring rolls, they were burnt and tasteless. Tom kha soup smelled like old feet. The basil beef had no taste and was more like basil vegetables after counting the 4 pieces of beef I got. The drunken noodles were tasteless. I have had better Thai at lower rated restaurants. Not sure why it gets good ratings, so confused."}
{"text":"Read some great reviews about Pan Asian on Yelp, thanks everyone. This place is F-ing great. We basically walked in and the owner and his wife cooked us dinner. It was just as if we had gone to their house for dinner. We had shrimp veggie egg rolls, I had pineapple fried rice and she had the red curry with pumpkin and eggplant. The curry was amazing, although their 1-5 heat scale is hotter than you expect, if you like 4, get a 3 possibly, the owner even said something about them being a \"spicier thai restaurant\".  overall 5 stars because of the experience and the amazing food."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.   If you're looking for a spicy dish that is well made, come to Pan Asian. Usually at Asian restaurants when you ask for extra spice they just throw more peppers on the dish. Here they actually prepare the spicy level and cook with it so the entire dish has a nice level of heat. I ordered an 8 for chicken pad see ew and a 5 on the massaman curry. If you can handle heat, then 8 is just a nice buzz of spice; 5 isn't much.   It won't make you sweat but your mouth does have a nice paralysis after eating. Stomach will be fine but you'll know you just had a spicy meal.   The curry was just ok but the pad see ew was excellent and actually a bigger portion than I anticipated.  The entire meal came to about $22 which is about average, maybe a few dollars too much. But based on location And the spice, I am very happy I came by and tried Pan Asian. I will be back for pickups in the future. I wish their menu had more selection besides protein, noodle/rice, and sauce, but I think I can keep trying new dishes happily in the future."}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant packs big flavor! Feeding my cold, I had the filet mignon pho (I ordered small, which I still didn't finish). I ordered it at a spice level of \"2\". I'm a heat wimp, so this was actually still a bit much for me, but it sure cleared the sinuses!   My friend ordered the chicken rice noodle soup (but he kept poaching from my bowl, so the clear star of this dining experience was indeed the pho).   The service was extremely fast. Our server was super cute, and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food . They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ... The food was delivered extremely fast on 9 miles from the restaurant ! Definitely will   Order again !! Thanks Pan Asian"}
{"text":"Friendly staff with some great dishes! The ambiance was very cool, almost moody in a way.  Very fair prices too!"}
{"text":"Came here randomly because I got work done on my car next door but I was really impressed!   I'm recovering from food poisoning so I just got the chicken rice soup but it was some of the best pho I've ever had! I got a side of rice and added it to the soup so it was more of a rice soup.   It went down great and the service was great!  I will definitely be back here for a low key date night soon."}
{"text":"Dinner service was very fast.  We ordered a yellow chicken curry and pork pad see ew.  My friend specified she did not want spicy, just mild but when curry arrived it was too spicy for her taste.  The pad see ew was perfection.  I had no problem with spice of curry so I enjoyed the food and would return.  Would've been 5 stars for me, if it hadn't been for the extra spicy curry.  I would still go back as the food was good."}
{"text":"We think this is the best Thai on the westside. The owner/chef is doing the cooking and the quality is amazing. Today we had the masaman curry and the linguine with asparagus, outstanding! The restaurant is small but you will get great personal service."}
{"text":"So I was told to try this spot by a fellow yelper and I'm glad I did it was super yummy their 5 is super spicy so we got a 2 and 3 and that was perfect the yellow curry was amazing and the pad see ew noodles were yummy can't wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"Food was delish.. We ordered the green curry with chicken.the drunken noodles..and chicken with black pepper stir fry. The flavors were all spot on and had my husband and I wanting more. Its a far drive from the strip but it is totally worth the drive. Dont ever settle for less!! We're from Ca and its the best thai food we've ever had.  Its the closest thing to authentic food in Thailand."}
{"text":"Cannot decide what to have for lunch since I did not bring food to the office today. Tried the DW Fried Rice and it was so flavorful and good. Serving was good too, I was stuffed before I even finished it. I started to sweat as it was spicy but I can't stop eating it. Would be back to try their other specialties."}
{"text":"I've been here serval times before and loved it. This time i was alittle let down. We ordered to go the shrimp spring roll appetizer which I didn't love. Very dry and the flavor didn't win me over 100%. My other complaint would be the steak pho we ordered. VERY little meat for the large and the noodles were just one giant glob. The pad see ew with chicken was fabulous so that was the topper to the meal thank goodness. Always good flavor and great portion. I tried some new items from what I have ordered in the past, but I think I'll stick to what I've loved so far from now on."}
{"text":"David is the owner and he is always there ensuring his restaurant is being operated to perfection. Friendly staff and place was busy. The negative aspect of this restaurant and my only complaint was the lighting and lack of privacy. Yes, the place is small so you have to sit relatively close to other customers which may be avoidable by dividers but not that big of a deal. However, something more pressing was the lighting. The kitchen is lit by big fluorescent lighting which takes away from the nice quint feeling a lot of Thai restaurants are offering. An easy fix but nevertheless an overlooked necessity here. My feeling was if the kitchen was separated with black out curtains it would provide for a more intimate setting."}
{"text":"I love Pan Asian, each time it's always way more delicious than I remembered it to be, and this is my favourite place. David & Lisa are both very charming & friendly and will accommodate to your needs.   Each time my dad just lets Lisa cook something different for him and each time he always finishes it all up and claims \"Wow that was amazing\"  I've never had a single dish that was disappointing, and I love their Roti which I haven't been able to find anywhere else in the US. My Favourite is Massaman Curry with Chicken, It's always cooked to perfection and I always need extra rice because I don't want to waste any of that delicious sauce.  This place has been named as the Best Bites of 2011 in the following article, and rightly so!  http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2011/dec/28/oxtail-sauce-cheesecake-sink-your-teeth-2011s-best/"}
{"text":"Difficult to locate from the street, David Wong's Pan Asian is truly one of those hidden gems in Las Vegas that everyone talks about. The small restaurant has become a staple lunch hangout for my colleagues and I due to its close proximity to my office, warm and friendly staff, and traditional Pan Asian food so good you immediately begin planning your next visit! The lunch specials are all the rage and can be yours for around $7 each. In my previous visit, I selected the Pad Thai and was not prepared for the gastronomical ecstasy I was about to be in for! To top it all off, David Wong himself was our server and I have yet to meet a nicer, more personable gentleman in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"My brother, my boyfriend, and I dined here at about 7pm and oddly enough, there was no one else here at the time.   We were seated quickly and given water and menus. David, the extremely patient and welcoming gentleman waited as we flipped back and forth with our menus, unsure of what to order. (I think David is the owner of this establishment, and if he is, he is doing a great job! He's so nice!!)   I ordered Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp to share with my boyfriend while my brother orders Basil... rice? Or something like that! We also ordered Calamari and a bowl of rice on the side because initially David told us that the Pad Thai came with rice but then he told us it actually did not, so we ordered rice to sort of absorb all the oils from the noodles. Everything, to me, seemed to be in large portions so it's a good thing I shared my Pad Thai because I still couldn't even finish my half! David gladly boxed the rest of my food up for me.  Overall, the food was great! (Although the Calamari did taste a little plain) Everything was delicious and also presented very nicely. The service was exactly how it should be AND bonus points for not even batting an eyelash at my service dog with me!-- right now, they have cute simple Halloween decorations in their restaurant and the staff in the kitchen seem to be in a very good mood :) the whole experience was so good that you can count on me coming back here!"}
{"text":"don't like pho? neither do I! but rather, get the beef noodle soup with flat noodles to cope with your hangover you party animal! party until it's 9am of course you need dank food to recover   remember, it's pronounced like FUH, not like the FO in FORREAL"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We've been there a couple of times in the last few weeks and, when my mom was in town recently, we took  her as well. We've tried a number of dishes here so far including the duck curry, the Malaysian yellow curry, and the Singapore noodles with a variety of proteins (chicken, shrimp, duck and tofu) and all have been outstanding.  The duck curry is a particular favorite, it is one of the best dishes I've had anywhere. Appetizer wise, the Malaysian roti is amazing and the calamari was great as well.   Service was outstanding every single time. The owner (David) is a super friendly guy. We enjoyed talking with him a lot. Just great folks here overall really.  And keep in mind, when they say spicy, its freaking spicy.  Its not like some places where you can order a top level spiciness and skate buy, they don't play around here (to quote David).  He warned me that the level 8 would be hot and it sure as heck was.  Just amazing.  Even the level 3 was hot for my mom.  I think I got the 5 on later visits and it still had plenty of kick.    In any event, this place is a real gem and everyone should eat here.  Its that good.  We plan to be back frequently!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to you yelpers I decided to order take-out on the way home.  This is a nice, clean, small place and the people are friendly.  Had the yellow chicken curry which was really good and flavorful.  Also the singapore noodles which I love but wasn't expecting mushrooms.  I know every place makes them a little different so I will remember to ask for no mushrooms next time.  Also didn't care for peanuts in my curry either but that's just me.  Will come back again and try some other dishes.  Be sure to check for silverware though, I only received one plastic fork."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Las Vegas. Pineapple fried rice is THE BEST, and their curries are amazing too. And if you don't try their pho, you're missing out. And if you're not feeling adventurous, just get the pad thai. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"How do they get 5 stars? My fiancé was disappointed as well. The funkiest looking pad Thai ever."}
{"text":"We're staying locally & have been to Pan Asian 4 times. Each time we have been served superb Thai food. The staff are all very pleasant as are the surroundings - not squeezed in unlike some other restaurants. There is a good selection of foods! I would recommend a visit. Service, food & value are all 5 star excellent. Thanks for helping make lovely evening dinner!"}
{"text":"Volcano Chicken is my favorite! Everything I eat here taste great! I love the fried rice also. They are always nice in here."}
{"text":"loved the papaya salad and chicken pad see ew. Only thing was I had to add spice! Only thing I was bummed out about was they didnt have mango sticky rice that night:("}
{"text":"If you are looking for an awesome twist on Asian fare you find the right place. They even have a roll with tempsura fried banana and lobster!  They have great noodle and rice bowls too. I was there for happy hour and had that roll and one of their hh drinks! !  A cocktail with soshito peppers vodka and yuzu juice. AMAZING ALL AROUND. coupled with an attentive staff and great atmosphere, you need not search any longer for a great destination for lunch or dinner. Check it out! !"}
{"text":"The most surprising thing about my experience here was that my friend and I didn't leave.   I think we actually found it comical how unpleasant the experience was.   Our drinks were awful.   My friend couldn't even drink her watermelon mojito.    The chef/waiter couldn't have been less helpful and more condescending, especially since at the time we were the only people there on a Saturday afternoon.    The sushi was good,  though I would argue that placing a chunk of jalapeño on top dominates the flavor of the sushi more than a touch of soy sauce.    And the rest of the food was good,  but the chef isn't \"beating Bobby Flay\" anytime soon, so he could be a little less smug and a bit friendlier.   All in all overpriced, poor service, and mediocre food in a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was great.  Beware of their spice scale as a 2 was spicy.  I started with a 5 and was warned that would be very hot.  We will come back here again."}
{"text":"I thought the food was lavorful and the service friendly but it took way too long.  We spent a total of 2.75 hours in that place for dinner. Will be back to try other items on the menu out of curiousity...  I wanted to love the fried Basil Rice but it was just shy of fabulous! It was hardy with a combo of chicken, shrimp and beef.  There were a lot of veggies too.  It was decent but not fab.  The green curry was typical.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Again, I wanted to love it but it was pretty standard and was lacking some variation of veggies.  The dish did have healthy helpings of al dente green beans and a few red peppers but it was a little flat.  Thank goodness for the spice #5 to kick it up a notch.  The interesting winner of the evening was the RED CURRY dish.  My husband and I agreed that it was the best of the three.  It had unique ingredients.  Eggplant, Pumpkin, Green Beans, Tomatoes etc. it did have more going on but it was more flavorful too.    Then on to Mango Sticky Rice! MY FAV! Blissfull sounds of joy in every bite! MY only complaint was the creme fresh that was laddled on top was pegged with SALT!? It was so overpowering that we scrapped it off the top and continued with our food-gazims.    This place is not horrible but it wasn't spectacular! I really want it to be so I am going back to try some more menu items.  I think it's a very interesting concept to mesh all these types of asian cusines into singular dishes but sometimes you just want A-typical Thai or Singaporian food and this you won't find here.  It's a melting pot for all Asian types of cusine.  Once you can wrap your head around that idea then you'll appreciate it for what it is... Pan Asian."}
{"text":"Place has potential I think, as closed, possibly for a menu and kitchen overhaul where not every dish tastes the same or nothing. Tried twice, green curry was swimming w not much on the beef and veg front, possibly catering to the toothless. Singapore noodles were bland. Had some other take out dishes that were unmemorable. Was a shame as had decent ratings but was last there 6 mos ago.   Tip would be to not try to put too much on the menu and focus on what food is your talent. Specialising in such a broad array of Asian food is signing yourself up for trouble. You will have better success narrowing down menu with your strengths and not throw items on you believe will be a draw for people when in fact it detracts."}
{"text":"I have to take the time to review this place again. My Lord, it is heaven! The food is just delicious. I mean, it's tasty and flavorful and my taste buds are overjoyed just thinking about last nights meal. I had the stir fry lingiune with shrimp. WOW. The thai basil is so good. I mean it, it is soooo good. I know she uses it in the Thai mango salad too. It tastes like regular basil, no worries that it would be weird, but WOW. It takes the dish from amazing to in my opinion exceptional. I've tried quite a few items on the menu. The fried tofu is good and I am NOT a fan of tofu. Weird, a vegetarian (95%, I went to Seattle and haven't been able to go cold turkey on fish since) who doesnt like tofu. The roti is so good. I've had roti before, but not like this. The curry sauce accompanying the roti is delicious. I wish I knew better words for delicious. Pan Asian is the place that allowed me to try the curry couscous at DW Bistro. If not for her yellow curry, I would be denying myself something wonderful. I can not say enough good things about this place. It's clean and bright, HUGE plus! The service is great. Always make sure you have drinks and always see how everything is. What more could you ask for. If you want great Asian food, THIS is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is cooking from the soul. Mix fresh ingredients with passionate cooking and what you get is one of the best Asian spots in the city. I haven't actually eaten IN the restaurant, but have gotten take out several times and each time the food has been consistently good.  The best dishes I've tried have been the garlic chicken, chicken with basil sauce, and the massaman curry with chicken. On the other hand, the cashew chicken was light on cashews and the chicken ravioli was a bit bland.  Portion sizes are decent and the owners are always friendly.   4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Pan Asian is another inconspicuous restaurant I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp.  I drove down the street and passed it twice and I was on the lookout for it.   The restaurant is quaint with a few tables. Interior is simple and understated. You can see right into the kitchen and see the chef in action.   My husband and I were greatly warmly by the owner and he made suggestions per our request. The prices were fairly decent. Based on the quick tips on Yelp, we ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli, Crying Tiger Salad, Massaman Curry with chicken and DW Fried Rice. We figured we might as well order a lot so we can have leftovers for later. We devoured all of the food and there wasn't a grain of rice left to take home.  I loved all of the food but the Crying Tiger Salad pulled at my heart strings. The flavors were so distinctive and strong and I have never tasted a salad like it before. I always order Massaman Curry from Thai places; Pan Asian raised the bar for me. The curry had the right amount of sweetness and heat. It came with avocado and sweet potatoes, which I've never seen before in other restaurants, and they were cooked to perfection.  The chef came by our table to check if we enjoyed our meal. She was so sweet and we couldn't sing her praises enough.  I pointed out at least ten more items on the menu that I have to try. I will definitely need to order more next time so I can enjoy some leftovers!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. The staff goes out of their way to make sure their customers are happy. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a chance to try out this restaurant.  Finally, I got the yelp deal where you purchase $20 worth of food for $10.  We were the first customers on a Sunday morning.  These are the items we ordered, for 2:  -Curry chicken and roti- Wow.  The roti was fluffy and crispy.  Dip this into the sweet and flavorful curry and you get one of the best roti & curry combination there is to be eaten.  I can eat this until my oil intake reaches its limit.  Tom Kha Chicken Soup-not quite the flavor I was expecting.  Or, not quite as flavorful as I was hoping.  It was just limey.  Had better.  Chicken Panang Curry-I am used to having more of the coconut taste to the Panang.  I didn't get much of the coconut here.  Not a huge fan.  Overall, it was a decent lunch.  I will come back to try other items and rate accordingly."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with this place.  The shrimp in the drunken noodle was so small that it looks like they put bay shrimp in the dish.  You think for an $18 noodle dish they can add some decent size shrimp.  Also ordered the Ebi roll which was so small that I felt it was not with the $14.  Also the. Lady behind the bar was horrible.  She took so long to give me my bill and she told me they were out of soy sauce.  I asked her if she can just give me a little container, but she told me they didn't even have that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant! Never fail to satisfy me, amaZing! The owner is really nice and the food in wonderful!"}
{"text":"We saw the good reviews and decided to give it a try.  Massamam Curry was my favorite.  I liked everything in it, potato, sweet potato, onion, carrot and so on.  There's even avacado in the dish.   What a wonderful surprise!  Crying Tiger (beef salad) is also great.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was their TomYum soup."}
{"text":"The pictures of the food here on Yelp made me think I was going to a big fancy restaurant, but it was a small mom and pop place. The waiter/owner (I think) was so friendly and enthusiastic and helpful. He had every reason to be: the food was great!   I had their version of Pho, which was indeed good, just not what I was expecting. Very garlicky and flavorful. I ended up trading with my boyfriend because he loves garlic, and his dinner had a ton of fresh veggies and a light spicy sauce. I can't remember what he ordered, but it was very good and I ate every last bite!   We also had the chicken ravioli, which was different but still delicious.It came with a lot of sauces, and the owner gave us a guided tour of them--\"This one is very spicy, but this one is best with this dish.\"  The portion was a good size, too.   We had a coupon from one of these websites, like $10 for $20 (boy, I'm not very helpful, am I?), so the price we paid was excellent. My bf and I were both happy customers and assured the owner we'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband was taking me out for birthday dinner. He went to yelp to look for the best rated thai restaurant in town & found this place. A bit far from our house but we went there because of the ratings. We ordered lots of foodand they're all excellent. 1. Appetizer, I forgot the name but it was scallops wrapped in banana leaves 2. Crying tiger salad 3. Grilled tiger shrimp mango salad 4. Seafood soup 5. Chricken rice noodle soup 6. Beef panang 7. Pad thai 8. Fried ice cream It's a husband & wife business. The husband was our waiter, really friendly guy and the wife was the cook who really know to cook good food. Overall, really good experience.I wish it is closer to my house."}
{"text":"A place I've had my eye on for a long time, there are a lot of thai places in Vegas and it was no surprise I haven't had a chance to come out here, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  The spice levels are no joke, with a level 8 on Pad See Ew burning my tongue a good amount. Oddly enough, I found it had more kick to me than my friend's spice level 10 linguini, but less of a smoky flavor. The Pad See Ew is well made here, and I have nothing to criticize on it.  The service was prompt and friendly enough, with the chef coming and asking us if we were okay with the spice level a couple of times. Several times people came in and were known by name, always a nice touch for the regulars. If this place was closer to me, I'm sure I'd have been here many times by now.  The only criticism I would have was that the thai ice tea that my friend ordered was too sweet and didn't have enough tea flavor. It was a point of mediocrity in an otherwise budget-friendly and taste-friendly meal."}
{"text":"Well, well, well WHADDAYOUKNOW!?!?! Its about time I give Pan Asian an update and an UPGRADE!  I last reviewed Pan Asian a while back in July 2011 and we haven't been back since our less than stellar visit. We had Pan Asian recently at Vanessa's birthday bash, and the Green Papaya Salad, Pad-See-Yeew, and Shrimp and Basil Fried Rice were all quite tasty, and I thought \"maybe there's that glimmer of hope for that fourth star after all?\"  We stopped in for lunch recently and ordered up our favorites-Pad See Yeew and Chicken Panang Curry. Portions seemed to have gotten bigger, and the flavors were FANTABULOUS! We will most definitely be back once another Pan Asian craving hits. ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(69/100) \"Four Star Bump\""}
{"text":"This place is good and the food is well prepared, however, some times I feel like it all tastes the same.. Also, portions can be small."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Asian cusine. The basil fried rice is always on point. Try the tom yum soup and shrimp rolls!!"}
{"text":"Pan Asian- I'm feeling Hot Hot Hot   I completely fell in love with some of the menu items and others I probably wouldn't order again.   In Love- Beef Pho was ridiculously good, the broth was well balanced we ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. Basil Fried Rice easily the best fried rice I've had since moving to Vegas it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor spice level 4. Pad Thai was delicious we ordered a 4 but ended up adding additional chili powder and hot sauce. We should've ordered a 6 or a 7 but once again the flavors were oh soo good.  Tried but didn't love it- Tom Yum soup spice level of 2, this could be just me but something was very bland about this dish compared to my local joint. Gyoza, don't get me wrong it was good with a nice crispy exterior and moist filling but it wasn't amazing. Massaman curry spice level 4 we added lots more chili powder once again this was a great dish but it didn't stand out amongst the many other times I've ordered it.   Side note- they were out of the mango sticky rice dessert.   Overall I will definitely come back to order my favorites here and I'm not scared to kick up the spice level next time either. They keep the water coming during your meal so don't be skeered."}
{"text":"drove up to an empty parking lot. They're in THAILAND until the F**KING 23rd or some sillyness like that. lol"}
{"text":"Caught the last half hour of happy hour where all alcohol is half off, 5-7pm during the week. We ordered the 3519 cocktail and found it overly sweet. Also got the thai tonic and it was refreshing with crushed cucumbers. Bartender said a crowd favorite.  Unfortunately no food specials during HH, but we ordered the angry tuna roll and split the pork cheek bowl. Pork bowl was spicy and a little underwhelming. Tuna roll was delish! Little bits of tempura and jalapeños on top of every roll. Good balance between the rice and the tuna.   Service was a little spotty and unattentive at the bar, but it gave us time to relax and take our time with the meal. Reminded us of Tamari in the feel and cuisine options.   Been here twice now and always pretty empty which is a atypical of a Lawrenceville place, even for a weeknight."}
{"text":"The fusion of Asian and different foods is expertly handled. Who would have thought to put Poutine with sweet potato fries on the menu? It was great! The presentation and taste of the Lobster roll was first class. And the Hanger Steak stir fry was scrumptious. The drink mixologist's  savory beverages were fantastic!   I can't wait to try some of the other entrees that the other reviews mentioned!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice staff. Asian fusion. We always have a good meal and the atmosphere is warm. The staff treat us very well. They have an upper deck and cafe style seating in front as well. My favorite is the lobster monkey roll!!!!! It's a MUST have every time!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. The food is always cooked as you order. Ingredients are fresh. Excellent chef and owner. My tips here are that when they warn you about ordering on the heat index scale of 1-10 with 10 being hottest, take them seriously. A friend that likes really hot food got a 7 and said next time to remind them not to go over 6. Also free refills on iced tea."}
{"text":"I love their pad thai and dw fried rice. Dw fried rice is the best fried i tried ever !!  Ive been their more than 20 time already. I am coming back here soon again. Also so close to where i live !  I wanted to try other things but dw fried rice is must get item everytime i visit."}
{"text":"I got a special Duck entree and it was the most delicious tasting mix of Duck, grapes, pineapple, and cherry tomatoes.  The sauce was simply amazing.  You can choose how spicy you want it.  I went with a 4 and it was still spicy for me.  I also tried the fried ice cream.  Soooo... good.  Very friendly staff and the owner was there when I was there and made sure I was satisfied with everything."}
{"text":"Pan Asian is a nice little, husband and wife run (the wife is the cook, and the husband runs the orders and register), neighborhood place that provides quality food.  The restaurant isn't fancy, and I've never seen the restaurant close to full except during lunch time, but it is clean, and the food is tasty and plentiful.  It's located in a strip mall, and the parking can get a little strange at time (you have to experience it to understand).  Pan Asian competes with \"Archie's\" Thai restaurant which is about a mile away.  Pan Asian's Pad Thai, is much tastier than Archies, being sweet, spicy, and savory.  However Archies curry has a far greater depth of flavor than Pan Asian.    The one thing that sets Pan Asian apart is the feeling of personal service.  You can feel that they care about you as a customer and work hard for your repeat business, making you want to support this local restaurant.    Due to the low volume of business that I have observed, I would be surprised if this restaurant survives.  However, do yourself a favor and visit the restaurant.  The menu spans Thai with a flare of Viet Nam.  Ask the owner for his recommendation, you might be introduced to a foodie treat that you've never experienced."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, loud customers, good quick service, excellent food, ordered mild. We would eat here again when in the area."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp deal here.  I dig this place.  It's way smaller than I had anticipated, but it makes everything seem more cozy.  They make everything fresh and there is only one cook in the kitchen, so my only complaint is that the food can take a little long to come out, but it is well worth it.  The red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it!  I was surprised at the ingredients since I'm so used to just bell pepper and bamboo in my red curry, but the owner told me that's how the royals eat it and he didn't want to put that \"cheap stuff\" in there.  I may have a hard time eating red curry anywhere else now!  The pumpkin is so good and unexpected in it.    I've also tried their linguine dish, which was flavorful and tasty.  It really reminded me of Pad Kea Mow at Archi's Thai.  Their pho was ok, but I am so partial to Pho So 1, that it's tough to impress me with pho.  The food is great and the owner is very friendly.  He remembers everyone who walks through the door!  He really pays attention to his food and his customers, which is much appreciated by this patron."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. This place must be a best kept secret because it has been in business since 2011 and this is the first my wife and I have heard about it. Fortunately, someone recommended this business to us for good Thai food and we were not disappointed. The Basil Fried Rice ($10.95) came highly recommended as well. The recommendation was on point. The basil added a really nice flavor profile to what is typically a plebeian entree in most venues. Also, I ordered an appetizer of Malaysian Roti ($6.95). Let me start by stating that I had no idea what Malaysian Roti was. I sometimes like to roll the dice by ordering a dish or entree \"in the blind\" so to speak. It goes without saying that this can go one of two ways, but hey, this is Vegas baby. I was surprised in a good way. It came with what I would describe as flat, sweet pastries with a small side dish of yellow curry, potato and basil. I could have consumed a bowl of the yellow curry that came with this appetizer. This was more like dessert to me and I probably would not order this again. However, I am definitely going to focus on one of their yellow curry dishes on my next visit. My wife and I shared two entrees. I ordered a stir fry of Cashew Nuts with Pork ($9.95) and she ordered a special of Pan Sear Salmon with Mango Sauce ($21.95). We were informed upon ordering that their food comes very spicy/hot. So that a 4 or 5 elsewhere is typically a 2 or 3 here. Believe it. Where I might go a 4 somewhere else I would not go higher than a 2 here. Both dishes were very good. Bottom line, I am looking forward to returning and trying new items on their menu."}
{"text":"I drive 28 miles round trip to pick up food from Pan Asian, that's how much I love this place! My favorites are the tiger shrimp mango salad, pad see ew, and panang curry although I have yet to try something on the menu that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Lunch curry specials are great,  smaller portions.  Didn't get too full. Masmana is delicious. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went to Pan Asian last night.  We are still talking about the food.  Great service, excellent flavors.  It was a slam dunk for us.  We ordered the spicy chicken salad, DW fried rice, massaman curry (outstanding!) and the shrimp ravoli type item (this was our least favorite but not bad).  I would highly recommend venturing off the strip to have a great meal at Pan Asian."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a place! They put some unique additions into classic dishes, that take them to another level of deliciousness. Like sweet potato & avocado in the Massaman Curty or pumpkin in the Red Curry. These make the dish not only taste amazing but also make them more visually appealing as well. Best of all the service can't be beat, very friendly and efficient. Almost felt like I was in Thailand, \"the land of smiles\". ;)"}
{"text":"I know I can't handle the heat, because we ordered the chicken curry with level 2 and I was panting!  It's okay, it was super delicious . We also ordered pad see ew and it was not greasy or saucy, just the right amount of flavor . The prices weren't too bad either."}
{"text":"I've had pad see ew at over 50 different restaurants.  This is one of the very best I have ever tasted.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Started with edamame it was fine nothing special. We had the drunken noodle and green curry with shrimp. The green curry definitely had a better flavor, we werent impressed with the drunken noodle. The portions are big. The shrimp are Bay shrimp, haven't seen those in years! Should probably warn people as it was a big disappointment. Restaurant was very noisy and the waitress wasn't very attentive."}
{"text":"Really awesome customer service and it doesn't taste like fast food. It tasted like well home cooked meal. The people were nice and it was easy to converse with them. Pretty quick also."}
{"text":"Placed a take out order due to the high review. When I got home, the food was a disappointment. I ordered garlic pepper chicken spicy level 8. When I opened the take out box, there are measly 9 pieces of thinly shredded chicken breast. The sauce was watery. The chicken tasted bland but spicy. Spicy hot was the only thing you can taste on the chicken meat. The food was nothing similar to the picture on yelp.  The curry was also bland and spicy. I like spicy food, don't get me wrong but spicy bland? Ewwww. The curry was also watery like as if it has been watered down. Isn't Panang curry supposed to be thick and rich? This is definitely the worst curry I have ever tasted.  I will advise everyone to stay away from this establishment. This is a waste of my money. I threw everything out after merely tasting it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy going to this small but quaint restaurant on the west side of town.  It is a family business who serves the best basil fried rice in Vegas.  We also enjoy their tiger shrimp salad with mango.  I am not a big fan of really spicy food so mild or even 1 star of spice is good for me, otherwise, you'll be asking for refill of water because when they say hot, they mean hot!~  It's a must try if you are feeling like eating Asian food.  As for the other items on the menu, they aren't bad.  Let's just so, I've found what works for me on their menu and they keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from Grubhub, it was fast and the guy was super nice, but I ordered the pork pad thai and it was horrible. Not even a little bit if spice, barely any flavor and the pork was just as uninteresting. Neither the noodles nor the pork had flavor or seasoning or anything. It was a little cold and very bland. I also ordered the Thai iced coffee, now I've never had thai iced coffee, so I have nothing to compare it to but it was gross. That could just be my own taste buds. I still wouldn't recommend it. It was a complete waste of money and I'm extremely extremely disappointed. I wish I ate at the restaurant so I could give it back and get a refund. I'm sure the other food might be good, but NOT the pork pad thai."}
{"text":"Two visits in the past year.  Both were pleasant, the food was faultless (and delicious!), and the bill was surprisingly low (get there during happy hour!).  I thought the portions were spot on.  I've never left there hungry.  Honestly the biggest problem is deciding on what to get.  Sushi?  Bowl of noodles?  Meat?  Each are a meal in themselves.  I had their version of pad thai last night and it was fantastic.  I like the atmosphere.  Not at all cramped or loud.  Very relaxed.  The service was great both times I went there.  I can't remember the name of the server last year, but last night we had Brad (friendly, attentive, knowledgeable).  Anyway, just wanted to give kudos for a great night out.  I often find myself on Yelp only when having had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few months the food is consistent and pretty good I usually do take out place because it is in need of a renovation. So this review is based on the food alone"}
{"text":"I was pretty hyped up for this place at first. The Yelp reviews were looking good, and the menu sounded yummy... plus, PAN's got that whole shiny new restaurant feel to it. The two of us ate here for dinner, with somewhat mixed results.  ATMOSPHERE: I like that you can choose from outdoor and indoor seating! We ended up eating inside, where the lighting was a bit dim and moody. I think next time I'd definitely try the patio.   FOOD: PAN's restaurant week deal is pretty sweet compared to what most restaurants offer. We each got the 1 roll + 1 bowl special for $20.15. Key-lime scallop roll: I think the sweetness of the sauce was a nice touch! Very interesting combination.  Lobster monkey roll: this one was kind of a miss for me. The flavors felt confusing, and while I can appreciate what they were trying to go for, banana in almost anything is a very overpowering flavor. When you pair it with mango, which is also pretty strong, it's hard to appreciate the actual fish in the roll. Drunken noodle: I liked this dish! The scallops and the noodles were cooked really well, and the flavors were good. Hanger stir-fry: my +1 requested it as spicy as they could make it, but somehow that got translated into an slightly salty dish. :( It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Many glasses of water were downed in the eating of this meal.   SERVICE: all of the staff we encountered were wonderful. Everyone seemed friendly and open, and I think we got just the right amount of attention. When Dave came by and asked us about our meal, we mentioned the salty stir-fry. He ended up taking it off the check, which was a nice gesture. In the end, it saved us $4 (since the lobster roll alone got charged as full price), but it was still appreciated. :)  I'd like to give this place another shot, maybe during one of their happy hours. So far, PAN seems promising, but I can't say I was blown away."}
{"text":"Pan Asian serves really good food. I ordered the Pad Si Ew and they actually made it with fat noodles, the true Thai way. I also split a Papaya Salad and that was excellent as well. I took a Thai cooking course while in Thailand last year and the food Pan Asian served was as good as that taught to me by the master chef from my course.   The service was really good as well.  The owner broke a glass but rather than freaking out or getting flustered, he quickly took a drink order and then cleaned it up.   One other thing with mentioning is that it's very reasonably priced! Two meals and tea came to a grand total of just $20!"}
{"text":"We were a huge party of 15 people and we stopped by around 9pm and they still took us in even though they closed in half an hour. Felt really bad but the chefs were really welcoming and in good spirits! Food was amazing! Some of the best Thai food I ever had. Thai tea is also the best I've ever had. Will make this place a priority to eat at whenever I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Glorious find off Strip! Wanna get away from the buffets and glitzy food joints on the Strip? Want some authentic Asian food? Then go to David Wong's! Just about 10 minutes off the Strip on the way to Red Rocks located in a quiet neighborhood shopping center. The food was fantastic. We had the crispy tofu and edamame for appetizers. For entree we got yellow curry w chicken and the pad EE sew. We asked for crispy tofu with that one but it came out with chicken instead. Chef Wong himself came out and apologized and made a new order immediately. I was impressed. I was half expecting him to just fry some tofu then bring it on the side not remake an entire dish. Great customer service. I thought it was a great sign that there were a couple of regular locals that came in and he even greeted them by name from he open kitchen. Such a different spin from the usual hectic \"give me your order then give me your money\" Chinese places back home."}
{"text":"Coming here was a pleasant surprise!  I am always weary about asian food, especially when you see multiple asian items on the menu.  This place had really good reviews on yelp and me and some friends wanted to give it a try.  The menu is kind of small but seemed like everything we ordered was pretty tasty and good.  WARNING: this food can be very SPICY!!... the waitress was super nice and warned us that their level 3 might be a level 8 for some other restaurants so we stuck to level 1-3 for our dishes.  It was still pretty spicy :(.  We ordered some tom yum soup which was pretty tasty but it seems everywhere I go it tastes different.  The main dishes were ordered were shrimp pad thai, duck curry, and chicken glass noodles.  This restaurant advertises \"fusion\" asian food and you definitely get just that.  The pad thai was good and spicy but tasted little different than pad thai i've had at other restaurants.  The glass noodles had a peppery, almost singaporean spice to it that had a very unique taste to it that was delicious.  The friends were a big fan of that! My fave was the special on the menu which was the duck curry!! oh yum!! There was soo much meat in the duck and the curry was so delicious!!! I'm just said it was a special and not always on the menu.  I'm not usually a curry fan, but this dish was very good and made my taste buds singing :).  There was also some different tastes including grapes and sweet garnishes in the dish that made it very memorable indeed.  The staff and cooks were super nice and attentive.  All the customers there seemed very happy with their dishes and most looked like regulars.  I will definitely try to come back again and try some of their other dishes, just less spicy!"}
{"text":"Pan Asian is probably my favorite all-around Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food produced. Although they don't quite have the selection as Lotus of Siam, they have all the classics. My personal favorite is the stir-fried linguini, which comes with your choice of meat, asparagus, tomatoes, and a spicy kick (there's no mild version). Other favorites like pad thai and pad see-yew are just as good. I love that the noodles are actually cooked to perfection instead of the typical half-assed versions that stick together at some other Thai joints. I also really enjoyed the DW fried rice if you're not feeling any of the noodle dishes. Their level of spiciness rates on a scale of 1-10 so if you're a first-timer, I highly recommend starting low (even a 3 is a bit too much for some people).   I've always had a great meal here. I've even catered through Pan Asian - they take large orders up to a day prior. They also have lunchtime specials on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with this review? I mean, I suppose we could go in order and start with the shrimp spring rolls along with the chicken and rice noodle soup that we ordered as appetizers. Everything was fresh, flavorful and fulfilling. The service was beyond attentive and Jolene, our server, was a delight. She made our first visit one that will be followed with many subsequent returns.   The Beef Pad Thai at a 2 had a kick to it that might as well have been a 4 or 5 at other places, but of course, that's subjective. You might scoff at my weakness for anything spicy; I'm a timid,  quasi-white guy who can't handle a few drops of Tabasco let alone a 5 or 10. However, if you're daring, ask for a 30. YES. A 30! I imagine an inferno could ensue within your stomach causing you to squeal with every bite, therefore if it's your first rodeo, do everyone a favor and don't be that person who wants to impress everyone in the restaurant. Dial down the spice and enjoy the meal as is.  Finally, what really made my head whirl in ecstasy was the Ginger Black Bean sauce served with Jasmine Rice. Beyond delicious! All-in-all, we had a great meal and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Good price, good food. Coconut shrimp were great! The owners & the rest of the staff were very friendly. Beef w/ garlic sauce was nice & spicy - we ordered it at a 5 on the 1-10 spicy scale & that was perfect if you like spicy. Pad Thai w/ chicken was also very good. Definitely will eat here again :)"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be an awesome establishment, good food, fair prices, and nice decor. However, the service is BAD. When we asked the server, how she would rate the spiciness of the food, she quickly responded in a sassy way \"I don't know because I eat a 10\". Her response made us feel dumb for asking.  NOTE TO SERVER: If you read this, please find another position within Pan Asia other than customer service...this truly affects your ratings because although the food is good it becomes tainted with your rudeness. Perhaps next time, we'll just ordered for pick-up or delivery."}
{"text":"Had the crying tiger and roti. Very good! Will be back to try more for sure! Spotless kitchen is always a good sign and the owners David and Lisa were absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! I went here with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. They weren't busy and we were seated right away (always a plus in my book). We started with an appetizer plate of Coconut Shrimp. It came with peanut sauce and sweet and sour. Very good! I am very picky when it comes to Non-American food, so I basically just stick to what seems familiar. I ordered the Basil Fried Rice at a level #1. It was loaded with chicken, shrimp, green beans, tomatoes, peppers and of course a ton of basil. It was absolutely delicious and the amount of food was two meals for me, so I ended up taking half of it home. My boyfriend ordered the Massaman Curry (that may be spelled wrong). It had chicken, potato, sweet potato, peppers and was served with a side of rice. He ordered this at a level #4. The flavor was delicious, but it was way too hot for me. It was just right for him and he loved it. The service was fast and friendly and we will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I've ever had. The owner is super nice, and doesn't laugh at you when you order your food super spicy, like they did at another thai place i ate at in chinatown...  I've tried the massaman curry, the sinagapore noodles, and the drunken noodles here. These are the best singapore noodles I've ever had- so delicious and perfectly spicy! The drunken noodles are KILLER. and the massaman curry was incredible as well.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu. It's all so good, and right down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"For my birthday, I wanted to go out for Thai so did a quick search of restaurants nearby and this place popped up on my phone.  After seeing the high ratings and reading some of the reviews, I was sold.  I trust Yelpers.  The restaurant is casual and relatively quiet so we could sit basically anywhere.  For starters, we ordered the Tom Khar soup and Vietnamese dumplings.  The soup was amazing with a perfect blend of coconut, lime, lemongrass, fresh ginger, and other magical ingredients.  I don't normally like soup, but this soup was addictive.  The dumplings were very good - I liked the fried garlic on top.  As we were eating, the owner/chef stopped by our table to see how the food, which was a kind gesture.  For dinner, we had the beef massaman curry and I had shrimp pad thai.  The pad thai came with a good amount of shrimp.  The noodles were more red in color than I have ever seen, but that didn't matter because it was unbelievably tasty.  The massaman curry had a nice blend or coconut, curry, and vegetables.  The beef was tender and flavorful from the sauce.  I really wanted dessert because the options were enticing, but I had other dessert plans.  The service was good and overall it was a great experience.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Pan Asian stays 5 stars for me.  I went back tonight.  It's amazing that the owners could remember me and what I ordered from one visit over a month ago.  I ordered Red Curry chicken with spice level of 8 and it was excellent.  My wife had the Garlic Pepper Sauce with chicken and she enjoyed it immensely.  We shared wonton soup for a starter and we also somewhat shared dessert--tempura cheesecake.  It was rich and oh so flavorful and David promised low in calories.  :-)  This is a special place with owners who are just so pleasant!"}
{"text":"Good food,  but need to improve in customer service and ready condiments, so it feels like we are in Bangkok"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food (taste, presentation, portion); excellent service; price is reasonable!"}
{"text":"Absolute best Thai food in Las Vegas. The soups, curries and stir frys are to die for. I love their fried rice. Lotus of siam has got nothing on this place. Everything is fresh. The  curry duck is the best but its carried fresh only so you might need to call in advance to reserve your duck, but its worth it. David Wongs Pan Asia puts all the other \"supposed Thai restaurants\" in Vegas to shame. The flavor and use of real spice is  phenomenal."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but omgosh the service...... went here twice and will never be back.   The first time I went, it took 20 minutes from the time I was seated until someone came to take my order. I didn't time it, but the rest of the service was excruciatingly slow as well.   Today's visit? The same horrible server (female with a ton of makeup, not the Asian girl) screwed up my check. She WAY over charged me for my lunch. When I asked for a new check because the amount was wrong, she argued back that it was correct. So I did the math for her, rounding up:  $9 (Panang curry chicken lunch) + $8 (chicken satay) + $3 (Thai tea) = $20 plus tax, but she charged me $38.75. I was dining alone, did she really think that was correct?!? So she fixed the check, but then I tried to pay and they didn't have any change. I should have just walked, but I turned my purse inside out to get the payment, informed her I won't be back, and left.   The food is not the issue here. Please hire competent employees."}
{"text":"I tried making an order looking at their online lunch special menu and it was impossible.  The lady on the phone wasn't helpful at all.  She admitted that their menu changed and that they didn't make shrimp with jasmine rice anymore.  She then hung up on me and when I called back, I was hung up on again.  If the menu has changed, please update your website.  Please also train your employees on better customer service."}
{"text":"What a great variety. If you didn't enjoy your meal, then you ordered wrong. Ask more questions, be more specific, and you'll get just what you want. I look forward to our next visit. This isn't a high-end atmosphere, but the food is great and the ambiance is comfortable and casual."}
{"text":"Been here twice now first time we had wonton soup, the soup was light and tasty wontons were very good but were made with chicken I'd say.  Had calamari and that is killer.  Then we started on the basil fried rice tons of flavor and a touch of spiciness.    The second time we came in they recognized us even for pick up both times that means something to me in a restaurant.  This time we got sweet and sour pork, tomatoes were in this sauce and no deep fried nuggets here either.  The flavors were balanced very well my only complaint is I like a thicker sauce.  Also tried the pineapple fried rice, yeah I'm a fried rice junky.  This was one of the best I've had a little touch of curry a little sweet good stuff"}
{"text":"Terri came back for her bday and wanted to eat here!  There was a bunch of us that came here and two in our group ordered some huge fish!  I should have ordered the fish, it looked delish!  I ordered the pineapple fried rice which tasted good but something I could have made at home.  I tried Ben-terns noodles which wasn't for me either.    The appetizers were great!  I really enjoyed the ravioli!  I would need to come back here again to try something more unique other than the rice I had but the dessert was yummy.  Both the fried ice cream and mango/rice!    Until I come back, I would still say this place is worth a try because it's a hit or miss on the food you have.  However, the service was great and staff was friendly.    Hmm: I think the kitchen was bigger than the dining area but I could be wrong."}
{"text":"Now didn't I tell you we'd be back?  Eight months is really too long though.    We were down in the area a week ago and Yelped for local eats.  We saw the deal going on ($10 for $20 worth).  I immediately bought the deal knowing that we would have to venture back soon (we decided to try a new restaurant that day).    We made our way back today and tagged a newbie along.  The place was empty but it was only 5pm on a Sunday.  The owners were great just like the last time.  David even remembered us from our one visit (8 months ago) and my initial review on the place.  *blush*  Anyway, this is what we had:  Crying Tigers (again) - still oh so good Pad Sew-Yee (or something) with beef/spice level 4 - very good, will probably go up to spice level 6 next time Malaysian Yellow Curry with chicken/spice level 4 - very good, thought about getting another to go for later cravings (I do live about 25-30 from this glorious place). Tempura Cheesecake - *sigh* so bad for the body but so good for the mouth!  As you can see my dedication to delightful and unique foods will force me to drive...almost anywhere.  I wish I could visit more often.  And the prices are just right.  An average plate is $7-$9 (I tend to round up when I see $8.95, just so you know).  David, thanks for the wonderful service and please, give our compliments to the chef.  ;)"}
{"text":"This was our second time going to Pan in the last 8 days.vto be honest, I normally like to read reviews on here before checking out new places, however, Pan was an exception and I was so glad for that! I am literally shocked at some of the reviews on here because everything about that restaurant is amazing!  When my boyfriend and I went there the first time, we ordered Hanging Tender ( hanger steak), which was cooked to perfection (rare as it supposed to be) and a pork belly plate. Pork belly was absolutely Devine with this out of this world ginger purée. I've never had ginger purée before and, to be honest, it was so good I'd rub that stuff all over myself (I know, tmi). While we were waiting for our order, one of the chefs brought to us a spicy tuna and avocado appetizer dish, free of charge. I am not sure if the name of it, but it was quite delicious. We also had drinks: Asian fashioned, Thai tonic, and straight up gin martini. They also were pretty good, Asian fashioned wasn't my favorite tho. Last night we went there again. This time we decided to split Cheeks bowl. The size of it was good for two people. At the first sight, it looked like a Pad Thai dish, but flavors were so much more mature with a nice kick to it. For drinks, I had a Year of Mule, which had an interesting spin on the standard Moscow mule, as well as lemon/lime gin martini (wasn't on the menu, bartender just whipped that out because of my preferences for nonsugary drinks, and it was outfreakingstanding!), and my boyfriend had Asian fashioned and lemongrass mojito. Once again, we were approached by one of the chefs who offered to us a pumpkin cheesecake, on the house. It was to die for! And that comes from a woman who doesn't even like pumpkin flavors. Pricewise, the place is definitely inexpensive taking under account the quality of products and the attention to detail. Just to compare, we went to a quite pricey restaurant at Omni hotel in downtown 2 weeks ago, and one of the dishes we had there was hanger steak that costed $30. Hanger steak from Pan was only $14 and it was, by far, way more superior in flavor and preparation than the one at Omni. All and all, I can't wait to go there again. I am so glad this place is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Seriously??? This food is ridiculously fantastic!!!  Service the same. ...i moved away for almost 2 yrs and David & Lisa remembered me...So impressed!!!"}
{"text":"3 stars. Not because their food isn't yummy (It IS!) but it is an incredibly small place and on more than one occasion, we had to go elsewhere because they had no more room and others already waiting. Which is a total bummer! At least that says something good about the food though,eh?  The food is really good, fresh and a great value for the price. (Enough for dinner and leftovers) However, be very careful about the spice scale, cause it's nuts. My hubby usually gets like an 8 at most places, but he got a 4 here and it was BEYOND spicy. Like, he had to throw it away cause it burned so bad kinda spicy. I got a 1 cause I'm a wuss and it was perfect :) Other than that, they are super friendly and I really hope they increase their seating capacity, cause we enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"Tonight's meal consisted of the usual faves; Pad See Yew, Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, Spicy Linguine, and Duck Curry ( husband likes quack quack) , but we were also introduced to one of the  specials, Volcano Chicken (YumME!) We also tried the Garlic Pepper chicken (super good), the DW Fried Rice ( good but still prefer the pineapple rice) and finally sampled two of the desserts- the Cheesecake Tempura & Fried Ice cream! Everyone agreed that the fried ice cream was better of the two.  As usual, EVERYTHING was perfect! We now have created 3 more Pan Asian addicts!!!  We love you Dave & Lisa!!!!"}
{"text":"What can we do to make this place busier???  I actually WANT it to be hard to get a table here because it deserves to be packed.  The food and warm hospitality make it such a rarity in the Valley!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many times. I decided to try it tonight since we were just next door at Reboot. Not a very warm welcome upon entering. We were served water but not offered any other beverages. Unless you know the owner/chef, your order will be prepared last as was the case tonight as two individuals who arrived and ordered after us were served rapidly. A mediocre wonton soup and adequate fried rice took over 15 minutes to prepare in a nearly empty restaurant. The mushy small portion of Pad Thai arrived several minutes after the rice and soup although ordered at the same time. There's just too many other Asian restaurants in the area to justify tolerating this type of meal/service. Instead I would recommend Thai Noodle House or Oasis Kitchen (Buffalo and Flamingo) it is not surprising that at 730pm on a Saturday night, this restaurant was nearly empty."}
{"text":"Delicious pas see yew! Awesome fried rice! Very friendly service. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is really a Thai restaurant. Flavorful. Definitely coming back. It's authentic Thai. Great value. Had Basil tofu - a bit greasy but really delicious. Guessing that it wouldn't have been as greasy with chicken or some other meat. Pad see yew was delicious. Lotus of Siam is still my favorite but for convenience and taste this will be my new favorite Thai. They serve pho too but didn't try it.... Since writing the first part of this review, I've returned several times. I get mine really spicy --- like 15... and they always laugh when I ask. The owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food...Great service. Always nice to see a Latino cooking. This was my first visit and not my last. The family is going on vacation. Be safe. Have fun. Hurry back tho..."}
{"text":"Yelp Deals saved me $10 at Pan Asian! I bought it 5 minutes before I got to the restaurant.   I always really enjoy the grilled tiger prawn salad. The shrimp has a great grill flavor, the mango slices add an interesting texture and flavor, and the fish sauce based salad dressing is light.   The only thing you should be aware of is it's spicy! I've ordered a 5 and I would tear and my nose would run. This time I ordered a 4, it was still spicy but tolerable and only my nose ran.   I really like the roti and I think it's homemade. It comes with a curry sauce. It's a little oily but so so good."}
{"text":"OMG.  You know that sensation when you burp up the great flavors of an awesome meal you just had? I enjoyed it all the way on my long drive home from this awesome restaurant.  It was the aftermath of a red curry with beef, which totally blew my mind in spite of my half-full stomach.  The star of the dish was actually the pumpkin, which works great in this sweet and savory environment.  My only regret was asking for a spicy level of 3, which was hot for me. Yes, I'm a wimp, but I had a 3 pad thai just fine at Archi's. This was like twice as bad.  Like my friend said earlier, if this was located on our side of town, we'd go there every day. Mr. David Wong, if you think you can replicate this beautiful bistro in Henderson or Southeast Vegas, we would be ever grateful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved from L.A and have been looking for a good Thai place. We have been to some around our neighborhood and they were just not up to our standards. We come across Pan Asian and that idea changed. This place has the best panang curry Ive ever had! The staff is also very nice and friendly. I asked the server if they will be able to make something that is not on the menu and he said that they would be happy to, which I love. I will definitely be ordering pad kra paw next time... I will definitely go back there and would recommend that you do too."}
{"text":"I must admit, I Went into dinner at PAN with very low expectations. I just wasn't really sure about the vibe, the prices, or the food based on other helpers.   However, I was delightfully surprised! While I do think it is a bit overpriced especially considering the other Thai, sushi, and Asian restaurants in the city, I absolutely enjoyed it.   We decided to try a bit of everything and we got the vegetable tempura, hanger stir fry, and the lobster monkey sushi.  Veggies- AMAZING. The tempura was perfect and not too thick and it came with a huge assortment and portion size.  Hanger stir fry- odd, but delicious! The steak was tender and the dish was spicy just how I like it!  Sushi- it had tempura banana in it! Which is the main reason we tried it (love the creativity). I think the sushi though itself was pretty comparable to other sushi. Other than the banana (which was subtle) it wasn't anything I would rave about. But still good.   We had a groupon which was great and had no problem redeeming it. I would absolutely go back"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and saw all the pictures - I knew I had to check this place out... So off we went to make our 30min drive to experience Pan Asian.... The place is small and has shiny red booth seats that looked like they were bought at an auction from a 50's diner.  The kitchen is wide open so because of this you can see everything that the cook is doing. We ordered fried gyoza for my extra picky daughter,red curry with chicken (minus the eggplant-alergic), beef pad sew ew, & Basil Fried rice.  I'm craving the Basil fried rice as I write this review. I loved that dish-The BF and I were just discussing how we love it when a dish is ordered and is seasoned well - so well that we don't have to add a condiment to the dish. Basil Fried Rice=Yumminess!!!! The Red curry was ok - the veggies in the curry were not to our liking. The owner guy (I'm guessing) noticed that we didn't eat all our pumpkin. We told him that we prefer potatoes and carrots. He said because they make  every dish fresh we can ask for them to put whatever veggies we want in our curry. I really liked hearing that-very cool!!!! The Pad See Ew was yummy as usual. The goyza was standard - I wasn't excited about this but this was all my picky child ate - so it served it's purpose.  This place is very out of the way for us but I'm gonna have to get me some Basil fried rice soon...."}
{"text":"The service here is always so warm and welcoming. Last time I was in I tried their massaman curry, which had avocado, sweet potato, onion, cashews, and coconut milk. The sweetness of the curry really balanced out the spiciness.   My latest visit I got their pad see-yew with shrimp. I do have to say it was sodium packed for my liking but my thai iced helped mellow out the saltiness. I'll have to come back to check out more of their dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a little out of the way but, you can't help but return time and time again! The Tom Kar soup is sooooo good! Then right into the Volcano chicken this dish is the best. A large portion of chicken in a sauce that you can have spicy warm or take it to untold heat no human should subject themselves to. This is on a layer of lettuce that makes a perfect wrap. There is a delicious way to calm the volcano and that is fried ice-cream another way to justify the calories to cool the burn. I love this place and will be back many many more times. The only bad thing about this place is when I take my out of town friends and family there that is the only place they want to eat when they visit. Ok that's not a bad thing we invite people here just to have another reason to come here.Thanks for your great attitude and personable experience Dave keep it up."}
{"text":"Small place off of Durango but very quaint.  Fast and friendly service. If your used to thai food in other joints I recommend ordering 2-3 spice level lower. I have eaten thai food in many different states and this is up there with the best. Penang curry sauce was amazing, the drunken noodles and the mango tiger shrimp salad were also very good dishes. Price was fair bur portions were smaller than most in Vegas, which I like as I  not a big eater, but if you have a big appetite order an appetizer, salad and entree. Will definitely eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Found this gem when I searched for \"asian food\" on Yelp! We arrived about 8:45pm and were the only diners (last order is 9:10), but the waitress was quick, attentive and polite. Our water cups were always filled up. We were asked on a scale of 1-10 how spicy, and we asked for 6. Whew!! Thank goodness we didn't go higher, LOL! We ordered the roti, basil fried rice and drunken noodles --- all fabulous!  The owner, I believe, chatted us up at the tail end of our meal. Kind man, great waitress and delicious food that made my taste buds say WOW and dance! We will definitely be back if we are in this area!"}
{"text":"yes, it's a one star and it's to stand against the five star reviews because I had the flip side of the coin experience.  we went in and the chef was in a frenzy because she was also the waiter.  I felt a little bad because 10 people came in the space of five minutes so, put her in an awkward spot.  I tried ordering an app the scallop one looked good and she told me she ran out of scallops. I asked if she could substitute it with something else.  I was told it wouldn't be possible because she was too busy between taking orders and cooking.  That seemed reasonable enough.  little disappointed but no fazed.  I ordered the chicken ravioli which is a misnomer because it's straight up chinese dumplings.  they were bland like the other yelpers mentioned.   I ordered the linguini and red curry.  I asked for the red curry spicy number one.  I got the linguini and it was too spicy.  She took it back and told me \"you should know basil sauce is spicy.\"   no, i didn't know I should know.    the male owner came by and said the same thing.  I told him he should mark it on the menu as spicy.  then he went on to say that each dish is authentic and they don't cater to americans.  that was the end for me.  but, the food?  the linguini that I had one bite of tasted like pad see ew with al dente pad thai noodles.  I don't get what anyone is praising it over.  I don't think using linguini noodles and keeping the traditional recipe categorize it as fusion.  the red curry was thin.  good flavor though.  i hate thin curry.    my experience went from mediocre to bad.  I'm not trying to bash the owners but, mediocre thai food plus bad experience is a bad combo.  The best thai still is komol, lotus of siam, thai place on washington and decatur (forgot the name) and siri (a great neighborhood thai place) in that order."}
{"text":"Ehhh. I agree with the lower reviews.  the people were really nice but My pad Thai chicken should not have been pink! didn't quite have that pad Thai taste I was looking for.  The restaurant was dingy and decor was underwhelming. 2.5 for the service and quick cook time."}
{"text":"I'd been drooling over the delicious-sounding menu for ages, and I'm happy to report that Pan delivered on food, service, and especially drinks.  My husband and I visited on a Sunday for a late lunch. It was around 2 when we arrived, so wasn't very busy (which suits us just fine), but as we were leaving the place began to fill up a bit. The patio looked lovely, but unfortunately it was a little too chilly to enjoy it. Inside the restaurant is really nice too, with a very \"lounge\" vibe that was quite romantic. The dining room features an open kitchen and sushi bar, which was a nice touch, but not obtrusive.   Pan offers a weekend happy hour from  12 to 3 so we were excited to try some half-price cocktails. I tried the Plumhattan first, and it was PHENOMENAL. One of the best cocktails I've ever had. Pepper and plum flavors go together so well-- who knew?! I'd definitely pay the full price of around $10, but at happy hour prices it was a steal. The waitress/hostess/bartender thoughtfully warned me that the drink contained a candied plum with a pit, which I appreciated. Later I ordered the 5 spice Sazerac which, while obviously not traditional, maintained the spirit of the classic cocktail. So good and so strong.   The food menu was a new fall menu which differed slightly from the one I'd been perusing online. But I was thrilled to see the Drunken Noodles had been replaced with \"Pan\" See Ew, probably my favorite Thai dish. The menu is small, but very appealing. We started with tempura vegetables, which was a large portion of a wide variety of veggies, including green beans, peppers, taro (I think), and best of all, shiitake mushrooms (again, I think they were shiitake). The dipping sauce was great, they were perfectly battered, and perfectly cooked.  My Pan See Ew was awesome as well. A HUGE portion of wide rice noodles, or just \"fat noodles\" as I affectionately call them, with chicken, broccoli, egg, more awesome mushrooms, onions, and a sweet soy sauce. My husband loved his Korean fried chicken plate, a dish that I'd never heard of but that he had enjoyed with Korean friends. Again the portion was very large, with large pieces of boneless chicken in an addictive sweet, spicy, vinegary sauce, and kimchi and seaweed salad. He said it tasted as he remembered it, and really enjoyed the kimchi also. I will say that all of our food was quite salty, slightly more so than even other soy-sauce-heavy places. I personally like salty food, but if you don't, you may want to be aware.   This review is already way too long, sorry, but I do want to mention that our server was great. She was doing several jobs at once, as it wasn't a busy time, but did them all extremely well. She seemed happy to be there, as did the chef and sushi chef, which goes such a long way to creating an enjoyable dining experience. I'm really looking forward to a return trip!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. Searched Yelp, and saw the great reviews. We got the lunch specials. DW fried rice, which had shrimp and chicken in it, as well as spicy red curry with shrimp.   Both were so flavorful. I have never had such good fried rice. The staff was super friendly, and the place is very clean and inviting."}
{"text":"These people know how to bring the flavor!  Calamari was exquisite as well as the seafood soup. If you don't like spicy be sure to let them know! I asked for drunken noodles ( not on the menu and they had no problem making it for me."}
{"text":"We visit Las Vegas often and are tired of expensive meals in the large resorts. So we have made an effort to try at least one off the strip restaurant per day. We had the Garlic ginger shrimp and chicken linguine stir fry. Delicious!! They were also excellent hosts very attentive and made you feel like you were eating in their home. We really enjoyed the meal and recommend it. Its off Desert Inn and S. Durango and it was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love David Wong fried rice, omg, amazing!    They are fantastic about spice level. I like a 10 and always served a 10. Friends like a 2 and receive a 2, pretty important as far as im concerned.   The service  is always excellent and staff is friendly. The food, omg, the food is incredible. Even if the service was awful, I'd keep coming back. They're food  geniuses and I so love that they're here in Vegas! !"}
{"text":"Awesome little mom and pop shop! I came here based on a recommendation from Dan P. and I'm so glad I did!  They have a small but varied menu that works toward their advantage. I love not being overwhelmed and knowing that the menu is small because they things they do have, they do well and put a lot of care into.  The day I went they were out of the scallops appetizer. From the sound of it, I'm not sure they'll be having this around ever since it apparently doesn't get ordered much. Next time I'll definitely try the Vietnamese ravioli based on other reviews.  I went with my boyfriend when we were starving (which in no way affects this review..) and we shared the Pad See Ew with shrimp and the yellow curry with chicken. While we were waiting our waters were always kept full and shortly after ordering our food comes out. Oh my golly. The noodles were a little sweeter than I was expecting, but deliciously smokey and a little chewy with crunchy pieces of broccoli throughout.. perfect. The curry was on the thinner side which is to be expected, and was perfect over the jasmine rice that came with it. It's a curry done right.. I won't wax poetic on you.  There's not much to be said that hasn't already been said in previous reviews except this.. which I will repeat: Go there. Go now. Get happy."}
{"text":"I always root for the little guy to make it. Sad to say this place is not there. I live near by, and it is now a Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Great food. Cheap price. Mr. Wong talking and serving while Mrs. Wong cooks it up. Do yourself a favor and get the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You must try the tempura shrimp! Also the Buta belly melts in your mouth. Definitely a great replacement for tamari. What makes it better is the menu and the price point! I Definitely will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This seems like a family owned and operated restaurant and it shows in the  taste and freshness of the dishes. The dining area is a little plain and could do with a facelift. The kitchen is \"open concept\" so you can see the entire cooking operation (once your seated though it's not as visible).  I rarely turn down a squid dish so I had to try the Fried Calamari. Its lightly breaded, or worded another way, it was very airy and crunchy. I prefer to have the squid more obvious but I understand the aversion many people have to squid so I guess I can understand the prominent breading. The chili dipping sauce tasted great and worked very nicely with the squid/breading.  The Singapore Noodles used very thin noodles, which was the primary ingredient. I ordered this dish because it contained bean sprouts, a food I also like, but there were very few sprouts even though its the first listed ingredient in the dish. The mushrooms, carrots, and bok chop were all very fresh and add body and flavor to the dish. This dish can be ordered with a spice level of 1-to-5, I went with 2, and at that level there was a nice subtle taste of chili spice. Also, six different meats/seafood can be ordered, I went with chicken, which came out fine.  The restaurant is clean and the food preparation is prompt. Well worth considering for a future visit."}
{"text":"My husband discovered this place a while back, really liked it and came back today with the whole family. I highly recommend the Scallop Amok (scallops, napa cabbage, lime leaf, lemon grass, chili, basil, and coconut steamed in banana leaf Cambodian style) that traditionally is cooked for four hours! It tastes like a spicy seafood egg custard. Pad see-yew  which is a pan fried noodles with Chinese broccoli, black soy beans and  egg is just okay.  Pork red curry with pumpkin eggplant bell peppers coconut milk is too sweet for my taste. I want my curry spicier. They have daily specials and I chose the Pan seared salmon with mango sauce, greens, cashews--- it's very refreshing but a bit salty from the fish sauce. They have better thai iced tea compared to other places. Fast efficient service. The owner himself went to our table and explained their menu which I think is a nice touch. Will definitely come back. I'd like to try the mango sticky rice for dessert but already so full--- next time ;)"}
{"text":"I can't think of another Thai/Asian restaurant that has a friendlier staff and as many outstanding selections on the menu.  We had a party of 4 and ordered: stir fry clear noodles, pad thai, yellow curry and panang curry.  The waitress asked everyone how much heat they wanted from 1 -10.  We had 0 on the pad thai, 3 on the clear noodles, 6 on the panang curry and 10 on the yellow curry.  The owner came out and made sure our friend with the 10 yellow curry had a pitcher of ice water!  He was great.  I sampled everything but the yellow curry and they were all wonderful.  The noodle dishes were all flavorful and had just enough sauce that the noodles weren't a clumpy, sticky mess but coated with deliciousness in every bite.  The panang curry was wonderful.  A little more spice/flavor than a red curry and the chicken was plentiful and tender. The jasmine rice was a nice accompaniment.   I'd like to go back and try their soups maybe for a lunch next time I'm in town.  Just a wonderful experience.  Seating is limited (30 or so) but turns over fairly quickly.  No alcohol but you can BYOB.  We didn't know or I'd have purchased a nice dry Riesling for the spicy dinner."}
{"text":"I think after reading all great reviews upped my expectations a bit too much.  Open kitchen design was a nice plus.  The chef was also very accommodating as our kids were eyeing her cooking.  But as far as food is concerned, I would not say it's extraordinary.  Everything was actually cooked a little too sweet for my taste.  It's probably a personal preference but I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped at Pan Asian for some sweet and sour chicken stir fry to go. We are new to the area, and we were told to go to another Chinese restaurant, but we found this place on Yelp and saw the incredible reviews.   The price was a bit more than I'm used to for picking up some Chinese, but we figured it was for quality and authenticity.   When we got in, the guy there was SO friendly. It was almost closing time, but he was so enthusiastic about helping us. He even set us up with water while we waited! At this point, I was thinking how this place is shaping up for a 5 star.   He asked about how spicy we wanted our chicken. I said I wanted mine a little spicy, my girlfriend said not at all. He asked \"0-10?\" And I said...6? He made a shocked face like, no, that's spicy! I remembered the reviews saying this place was spicy, and I said ok ok, 5. I like spicy foods, I eat them frequently, but I don't like to not enjoy eating something cause it burns. I told him \"not TOO spicy\" and he went off to make the food.   We were impressed because we watched him slice up the fresh veggies for the dish, and everything looked really good. We got home, and my girlfriend tried hers... Delicious! I tried mine... And I thought, huh. This is a 5!?!?  After a few more bites, my mouth was burning. Bad. But whatever, I usually like spicy food, so I figured it was right at the end of my tolerance. I was wrong. After eating some more, my stomach started to bother me, and it messed my stomach up all night. It was SPICY.   We were very excited to make this our local Chinese place. Although it was more expensive, it appeared to be fresh, the service was friendly, and we liked the atmosphere in the restaurant. However after this experience, I'm going to have to wait awhile before I go back.   I see other reviews mention this spicy thing. I generally love a place that is brave enough to make their spicy actually spicy. However, if someone is giving you a FIVE out of ten, it shouldn't be so hot it's difficult to eat. Using a scale like that is supposed to be a scale of what the average person considers 0-10, not what they do.... Otherwise it's useless."}
{"text":"It was ok. The Drunken Noodles had too much green bell pepper, which is an inexpensive common vegetable that I didn't know was cooked so much in Asian food. David Wong's Fried Rice was a dollar more than what the restaurant's website indicated. The hard menu an online menu aren't the same price wise in it's entirety."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and we were told to check out Lawrenceville. Came here based on the reviews on Yelp and I was very disappointed. There is indoor and outdoor seating with a nice patio if you are into that. The music is super loud outside and would be hard to have a conversation outside. Indoors, the music was not horribly loud, but the playlist consisted of punk rock and just random songs that you wouldn't really expect for an asian fusion restaurant (probably could make a music video in here though).  Food wise, pretty disappointed. I had the Chicken Tom Kah which comes with egg noodles, coconut milk, lemograss, bok choy etc. The bowls they come in are shaped such that the sauce pools at the bottom of the bowl and makes it hard for you to taste the flavor in the noodles. My dish was essentially noodles, bok choy and a small piece of chicken. The sauce itself is watered down and you really can't taste the coconut in it. My girlfriend had the drunken noodles and she had the same problem with the pooling of the sauce and said it was ridiculously salty... not trusting her, i tried it and yup, it was like eating a spoonful of mortons salt... i guess you get your iodine for the day. Overall, not a fan of this place. For the price and hype built around it, this place does not do fusion well at all and you'd be better served checking out a different asian place. Service is quick and our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Super delicious! Get the pad-see-yew with chicken at a spiciness of 4. This place is very spicy, so 4 is perfect!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this through Yelp deals. Arrived in time for their lunch specials.   Tried the Singapore noodles, Pad Thai, and Red Curry chicken. I highly recommend the Red Curry- as others have noted, it is very unique in that it includes pumpkin and cashew nuts.   Great little mom n pop restaurant. Husband takes the orders while his wife works her magic in the kitchen. It is a bit of a drive (15 min) from the strip, but well worth the trip if you are in the mood for some Thai food. The menu boasts other types of cuisine but I feel their Thai flavors stand out more."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!!  Not only was the food excellent the service was just as good.  AND the prices are extremely reasonable.  I had the Garlic Pepper Stir Fry.   I was with a party of three.  Must have stayed for close to an hour after we were done eating and never did we feel pressured to order more or that were weren't welcome.  The servers were just fantastic.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best fried rice my daughter ever had.  I got the pad thai with pork.  The noodles were delicious,  but the pork a little dry.  They deliver with Grubhub and Bite Squad. Our servers were wonderful."}
{"text":"They make the best curry in Las Vegas!  My boyfriend and I really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Simply awesome. I ordered mine at a level 20 hot. I'm ready for a 30!  Everything we had was delicious.  I had the green curry with chicken and I look forward to experiencing it once again.    My brother in law ordered the cheesecake.  Holy Toledo this was insane.   Just try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Eating here was a good experience.  I bought the Yelp Deal: $20 for $10.  I've decided that Groupon mostly sends you to places that are having troubles for a reason.  That is, I'm usually disappointed with the Groupon experiences.  Yelp Deals, on the other hand, have turned out pretty good so far.  This place is a little far from home.  Usually, if I drive this far then I just go on down to Chinatown.  Parking was ok.  Upon entering I turned to my girlfriend and commented about how this was probably going to be a bad experience because the place was totally empty.  It was around 6:45 pm on Tuesday.  But, we settled in determined to give it a fair try.  I began noticing all of the nice things about the place.  It was nicely decorated.  I assume the owner did the decorating.  I describe it as contemporary Asian.  It was not high end Vegas strip decorating style, but more like well put together do it yourself style.  The kitchen was in full view of the dining area.  I always like that.  I cringe to think what goes on out of sight.  So many restaurant shows today let us normal people peek behind the curtain and witness the often disgusting truth.  Also, I was delighted to see Asian people making Asian food.  At least makes me believe I'm in for authentic flavors.  Modern music played lightly over the audio system.  It was pleasant.  I assume the man waiting on us was the owner, David Wong.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He did a really good job.  He tried very hard to give us a great experience.  Every item on the menu was under $11.  That's pretty good.  I like good food, but I enjoy it even better when I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The menu had a variety of Asian dishes, as the name implies: Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, etc.  We ordered two dishes.  The first was Filet Mignon Pho.  It was a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho.  My Thai girlfriend explained that the abundance of roasted garlic was a signature difference.  The sauces were all added before serving.  The veggies were slightly different (can't explain) and the meat was filet mignon (Wow! Step It Up!).  The noodles were cooked just right.  I enjoyed the Pho, but there are way better places to get Pho in this town.  The second dish was Basil Sauace Stir Fry.  It had chicken, sweet basil, garlic, chili tomatoes, and long beans served with rice.  Spiciness was 8 out of 10.  It was really tasty.  I specifically enjoyed the fresh veggies.  My only complaint was that the dish had too much oil.  I realized just how much after we finished the dish and were left staring at the puddle before us.  It made me feel a little bad about something I had just enjoyed.  We were pretty much full, but wanted to spend at least $20 for the Yelp deal so we ordered another entree.  We had asked the server earlier what their signature dish was.  He recommended the Pad-See-Yaw.  So, that's what we ordered.  It was pan-fried flat noodles with pork, broccoli, black soy beans, and egg.  My girlfriend explained that this dish is commonly ordered by Caucasians at Thai restaurants.  She was surprised that I had never heard of it (we usually eat Thai food at her house, not restaurants).  It was very sweet.  My girlfriend and the server had a quick conversation in Thai.  He asked if we wanted a dessert.  We said no, but I thought the sweet Pad-See-Yaw was dessert.  After he left, my girlfriend explained that she told him it was too sweet and he replied that its how Americans like it.  I thought that was funny.  We were already full when the third dish came out so we tasted it and put it in a to go box.  The server came by and chatted with us for a while.  He explained that he had been open for about nine months.  Before that he had a successful high end Asian restaurant in Florida.  Articles hung on the wall behind us explaining it.  By the time we left it had become pretty busy.  The place had four or five more couples and a few take out customers came through.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The server was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu was very affordable.  The decorations were interesting and inviting.  I really wanted to give it five starts, but  the food was good, not great.  Its worth a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful little family owned restaurant. I had the Basil Fried Rice and it was very flavorful and delicious. They have an awesome menu featuring Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisine. Awesome variety and I imagine everything tastes as good as it smells in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food, affordable price, and friendly service!   The main guy is funny and very accommodating. Offered some suggestions on which ones are their popular dishes. BF went for the Massaman Curry with beef and I went for my favorite chicken Panang :)  I usually get papaya salad and pad Thai but we were feelin' curry that day. We really wanted to go for dessert but since we both ordered a second helping of rice we didn't leave enough room :(  We'll definitely come back!  UPDATE: I've been here a couple times and after some evaluation, I say their Thai menu is definitely A+ their \"other\" items however can be a hit or miss. I've tried their linguine and I wasn't a fan. This restaurant's cuisine is Thai to begin with so I don't stray anymore. They do have one of the best curries in town !"}
{"text":"Tom yum soup (3 on the spicy level) was pretty good. Also had the DW fried rice with beef instead of chicken (level 2) which was very very very good. For desert we had the cheesecake with ice cream and that was yummy too."}
{"text":"This place is Pan-tastic! Cooked to order. I love it when the chef, Lisa,  comes out to check how you like the food. That's cooking from the soul. She can make things off the menu if you know what you're asking for. Although I do not claim to be the specialist on Thai cuisine, you know this place is legit when Thai people (Sirintra my one Thai friend) love it.   Yay! I'm a fan, but I am not a fan of the decor and setting. It's rather confusing to eat exquisite dishes and then drink from a styrofoam cup. I think people will be amazed at the quality of food, but rather disappointed in the ambiance.  Seems harsh, but know what you're getting into before you get all dressed up for a nice date."}
{"text":"Very creative and tasty dishes! My favorite was our appetizer which consisted of wok-fired brussel sprouts and this mild green pepper with pomegranate soy sauce! The portion was pretty impressive, too. My noodle dish and my friend's sushi was quite nice, too. Overall, what impressed me most was that the head chef came out and talked with us, asked about our impressions of the food, and invited us back again! I really, really appreciated that. How lovely! Will definitely bring some friends back here to hang out again. Food = A, Ambiance = trendy, Staff = A+++ :)"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Asian food I have ever had.  It all started by a recommendation from a friend at work.  My girlfriend and I were so impressed with the fresh flavors that we ended up coming back 3 times in a matter of a week and a half.   So far I've tried, Pork fried rice (which isn't on the menu as far as meat wise but David was more than happy to make it), Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Tom yum, Beef rice noodle pho, volcano chicken (house special) and stir fried linguine.    Pork fried rice - literally the Cadillac of fried rice. Best I've ever had and I love eating fried rice from everywhere.  Pad Thai - heads and shoulders better than most Thai places here in Vegas.  Even better than my beloved Archi's.  Shrimp Tom yum - Spicy but wicked fresh.  Loved it.  Beef Rice noodle pho - This is what changed the game.  I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that has had more than 1 item that I considered the best I have ever had.  There's not even words to describe how amazing it is. Just try it. Please. Like now.  Volcano chicken - Sweet breaded fried chicken with a hint of spicy.  Flavor was out of this world.   Stir Fried Linguine - girlfriend got this and she hates linguine.  We figured if there's something that we might not like it would be this. WRONG. It was epic and now has me second guessing why I have never liked linguine.    TLDR; Come here and eat David's amazing food.  Will not disappoint and you will %100 have a favorite dish or 2 here."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pad thai noodles. Nice presentation. Quick service. Server was friendly and attentive. Didn't have to ask for refills or the check. She was ready to serve and knew when it was needed. The pad thai tastes good but the noodles stuck together as though it was a little overcooked. It isn't the best pad thai I've tasted (which was in Portland, OR) but it will do while I'm in Vegas. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here to pick up some takeout & ordered a beef drunken noodle & a chicken pad thai. The portion seemed to be just right (not too little but also not overflowing). The flavors were pretty good but I could've used a bit more of a kick to it. The chicken in the pad thai was slightly on the dry side but the beef was cooked nicely."}
{"text":"Meh. It's not terrible but far from the 4.5 stars it has! The food does not taste fresh at all. The pad Thai noodles were super thin, almost like an angel hair pasta thin. I had never seen that before."}
{"text":"A well deserved 5 star rating! Half off drinks during HH and a new modern twist on sushi/thai? I'M THERE! In fact, my first experience at Pan was so great, I came back the next night for dinner and brought a group of friends for brunch this past weekend!   Food and drink specials may lure me in but it's the quality of the service, variety & flavor profile of the food/drinks and an appealing atmosphere that will keep me coming back. Pan hits the nail on the head in all of the above. At first glance, the restaurant seems small but after a tour this past weekend, they have a spacious upstairs dining room with a back porch that offers an incredible skyline view of dahntahn! Along with the outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant, I am pumped to experience those accommodations in the warmer months.  A huge bonus at Pan is that all of there dishes are made with Gluten Free soy sauce! I've tried various items on the menu, allow me to rave about them... -Libations: Bloody Dragon. Say no more. I get this drink during every visit. Phenomenal homemade bloody mary mix with wasabi, pickled ginger, Sriracha & garnished with olives and a lime. The name is accurate, you'll feel like you're channeling a dragon and breathing fire. Spicy, satisfying and not too heavy. I've also tried their version of a mai thai, dirty martini, old fashioned and figgy sidecar. All pack a punch and are full of flavor.  Noms on noms... -Shishito peppers: accented with brussel sprouts and pomegranate soy. The menu describes them as wok blistered and they certainly are! Delicate crunch with full flavor. A decent size, too. This is a great starter dish because it leaves plenty of room for sushi and an entree.  -Key-Lime scallop roll: the coconut key lime sauce with the seared scallop is a party in your mouth. Order it. Right now. -Angry Snapper (without the Tempura): The fresh sliced jalapeno on top is the perfect compliment to the combination of tuna & snapper.  -Green Roll: Soy paper wrapped rolls are an acquired taste but I really like them. During my second visit, my date wasn't a huge fan of this roll but I would order it again. The mango-habanero sauce isn't as spicy as I'd like but the mango pairs nicely with the cucumber and avocado.  -Daily special roll: This isn't on the menu but their daily roll during my second visit was a salmon roll that had sweet potato fries in it. Oh yes, I was all over that. Not as good as Key Lime Scallop but no complaints.  -Thai green curry: During my first visit, the waitress told me that all of their noodle dishes are thicker than traditional noodle bowls. Even the Pho isn't heavy on broth. The green curry was spicy and a huge portion. Plenty of cauliflower, brussel sprouts and edamame. -Drunken noodles: I've ordered this dish twice and I know I'll order it again. The flat rice noodles absorb so much flavor from the dark chili soy sauce that they make a solid base for the scallops, bok choy and sweet peppers.  -Lox fried rice: despite the soy and huge capers, the smoked salmon flavor was strong and pulled through nicely. I would like to see more onion and pepper in this dish to balance out the amount of capers.   Service has always been friendly with great recommendations. The only lag I experienced was sitting at the bar seating in front of the kitchen. That area is serviced by the bartenders instead of waitstaff so as the bar filled up, we were left to ask other servers & kitchen staff for utensils/napkins/etc  Overall, great experience all around. I will be back and look forward to trying more dishes and daily special rolls!"}
{"text":"Healthy proportions of veggie's, protein & rice with their Penang curry w/ Chicken. Ordered @ 5 on their heat scale was spicy enough while still allowing enough of the cocunut and curry flavors peak through. The chicken was just right...tender and juicy which can be tricky when using just breast meat. The Calamari was crisp and battered licghtly with cornmeal served with a sweet chili sauce dip. Flavors on point. The fresh preparation definitely has a home made feel and taste...I'll definitely swing by again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"So I was really late to game on sushi. It took me awhile to open my mind and tastebuds to it, but when I did, it was with some sort of banana-sauced sushi roll at Pan during restaurant week last summer. I immediately started kicking myself that I hadn't tried sushi sooner. Enjoyed some de-lish drinks in the hip restaurant and even though the sushi was divine, I think I was transported to another universe with the pork belly. Pork. Belly. Wow!"}
{"text":"David was very nice and the food was great."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and a wonderful owner who sets the positive and friendly tone for the restaurant. I had the Tom Yum soup (#[17) and drunken noodle (#40). Both excellent but watch how hot you want it. They'll make it to your taste - but I d advise 3 unless you like it very spicy!"}
{"text":"Great curry and shrimp salad small local place but will defiantly going back next time in town"}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  They were located on S Durango Dr between W Desert Inn Dr and W Sahara Ave in Las Vegas.  I was surprised how many customers were there for such a remote location.  I was disappointed that the Lunch Specials were only Monday- Friday.  They offer 5 entrees for $6.95-8.95.  The owner's wife wearing a chef's jacket greeted me and handed me a paper menu.  She thought I wanted food to go, but I sat down.  They had glossy paper menus on the tables.  They serve Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese cuisine.  The owner took my order.  I wanted the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad Thai Hot.  He suggested that I order it a \"6\".  I told him I wanted it a \"10 Thai Hot\".  It really was Thai Hot.  This was one of the few places I have found that makes Thai Hot.  There were 5 grilled tiger shrimp with the tails on a bed of mixed greens, julienned mango, red onions, bell peppers, whole cashew nuts, Asian herbs, with a chili lime dressing.  I will be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  And the service we received from Jolene was excellent!  I highly recommend the Basil fried rice. Great meal for a reasonable price. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Soooo much flavor!  We loved this place - the basil fried rice (spice:6) and the drunken noodles (spice:9) were both so good we couldn't stop eating, despite definitely being full and that we knew our stomachs were going to hate us for the spice level.  Fantastic food and a very home-y feel."}
{"text":"We said \"Misti sent us\" - true, but indirectly.  We chose Pan Asian based on the great reviews of Yelp, and were not led astray.  While fluorescent lighting isn't my preferred ambiance for dinner, the food and David's ceaseless sense of humor far outshone the lighting.    We brought a started bottle of wine with us, half-full because we didn't want to polish off a whole one, which we knew we could, and would. He promptly brought us wine glasses, and when he noticed us skimming ice out of our water glasses, he brought us a big glass of ice with a spoon.  Service was like that consistently.  We shared two entrees - the Musulman Curry, with Chicken, and the Stir-Fried Linguine, which for once I was able to convince seafood-challenged hubby to allow me the pleasure of ordering with shrimp.  I loved the addition of sweet potato and avocado to the curry dish; both blended perfectly with the sauce.  I would have loved it even more if it were a tad less sweet and one star higher up the spice ladder.  The linguine was terrific, and I reveled in the rare delight of having Asian food with - omigod - shrimp!  But alas, the shrimp was tasty, but was missing that crisp \"bite\" that should come from wok cooking.  The veggies, especially the asparagus, had it, but not the shrimp.   Still, it worked!  We left happy and full, and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I forgot how delicious Pan Asian was until I came back to try their Mango Shrimp Salad! It has slivers of mango slices piled on top. I'm glad that the mangos were a little on the sour side. I don't like overly ripe mango. It had little pieces of purple onion with greens and grilled shrimp. The tartness of the mango balanced out the bitterness of the charred parts of the shrimp. The dressing is nice and spicy it is so good! This salad would  even taste good without the shrimp!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was casual dining and family friendly.  Our party of 3 (2 adults and 1 toddler) went on a Monday night and it was not packed (if you have a toddler, you know a quiet and chill restaurant is the BEST environment).  We ordered 3 dishes and asked for a rush on the DW Fried Rice to keep the toddler calm and they were happy to accommodate. The DW fried rice was delicious, my toddler was dancing after every scoop, so you know it's GOOD!  We were recommended the Garlic Pepper chicken and i would have to say that i am glad that we tried it.  At first glance it looked like it would lack flavor because the chicken sat on top of what looked like steamed vegetables.  The garlic pepper chicken packed SO much flavor that it worked well with the vegetables.    Overall, the service and food was fantastic! This might be our NEW go to Thai place!"}
{"text":"I used to love Tamari, particularly for their happy hour and was very disappointed when they closed.  I thought I would give Pan a try though but I was really disappointed.  Maybe it was the things I had, but I just did not have a good experience.  Their fish in their sushi just didn't taste fresh to me and it wasn't good.  I also tried some sort of short ribs and the sauce was on too thick and was sickly sweet.  There was one tofu dish I had that was pretty good, but that was about it. The drinks were ok but the service was pretty slow and inconsistent.  It also seems a bit overpriced and doesn't have the same nice happy hour deals that Tamari was known for."}
{"text":"Wooooooowwww, The food here tastes so good every time I stop by, Pan Asian never let's me down  All of the dishes that I have ordered so far are amazing and well portioned! The customer service is also outstanding! I didn't have to call over the server once, she gradually checks in to make sure everything is good or if we needed anything and makes sure our drinks are filled.   Ordered Dishes: Crispy Spring Rolls, Red Curry, Massaman Curry, Panang Curry, Volcano Chicken, Stir-Fried Linguini, and Pad See-Yew  Customer Service: Excellent  Food: Very Tasty and Fresh  Can't wait to go back to try some more"}
{"text":"Just ate (attempted to) the drunken noodles. Tastes amazing but it was so spicy I couldn't finish it.  Fyi. 4 out of 10 was so hot I was sweating. And I eat spicy food.  So be careful next time I'll choose 1 or 0 The lady who took my order was very nice food was prepared very quickly."}
{"text":"This is got to be one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas! The quality of the food is incredible!!! We had the calamari for an appetizer and it was so tender and fresh, not a bit chewy at all...... The Filet Mignon Pho was delish! Flavor was really great! Lots of tender filet noodles and super spicy just like I wanted!  My husband ordered the Duck w/Curry sauce. I had saw this dish on Yelp and my husband was excited to try it. When we were looking over the menu I couldn't find it anywhere. The waitress said 'oh yes we have it',  I am not sure why it isn't on their menu????   I saw so many dishes I want to try........ Singapore Noodles.... Pad See Yew...... Drunken Noodle...... ALL look amazing!!!  I love spice so I ordered a spicy level 5 after the waitress warned us that their food was on the spicier side. (I usually get a 6 or 7) The spice was perfect for me! Compared to a lot of other Thai places though, be aware they are on the spicier side of that 1-10 scale!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I highly recommend the awesome food here. My only complaint is that my bill was higher than what the menu stated it should've been."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Came for dinner with my hubby and we were the only ones there. Got greeted by the owner and his daughter. We ordered the Vietnamese chicken ravioli , filet mignon pho and drunk noodles . Everything was delicious and fresh . Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"This place puts more effort into its image than it puts into its food. And charges you more for it. It's not that the food tastes bad, it's just that it isn't great. Kind of like a warmed over fancy frozen dinner with extra garnish. The people working there were very nice, and attentive. Then again there weren't many other customers to worry about."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend just yesterday.  I can honestly say that this was the best shrimp pad Thai that I've had.  I will definitely be back.  Very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Unbelievable....food, drinks, music, service, atmosphere.  They hit the nail on the head with everything, excellent pairing suggestions from the bartender as well.  Extremely knowledgeable when it came to recommendations.  I highly suggest this restaurant at \"the other end\" of Lawrenceville.  Not enough people no about it, but they will."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went in there today and got the chicken basil, which was probably the best I've had. Ever. The owners (husband and wife)  were very nice from the moment I walked in. I told them that I wanted my meal very spicy, and they didn't disappoint. This was a nice change of pace since most places I frequent usually don't deliver when it comes to heat. The chef - who is the wife - told me that when people ask for spicy, she gives them spicy. I love that attitude! The ingredients are very fresh, and the chicken was nicely trimmed of any connective tissue or fatty bits - which is another issue I've found all too common at other places.   I will definitely be visiting this place often as there is so much I want to try on the menu! I miss Mad Pita, which used to be at this location, but im hoping that Pan Asian lasts a while! Please, everyone, go there and try this place out. If you like Chinese, Thai, Japanese, or even Vietnamese food (really want to try the pho), I don't think you'll be disappointed. The prices are great and it wasn't busy at all when I was there for lunch,but hopefully that changes!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town hands down! I have never had a bad dish here. I often come here to meet up with girlfriends or family dinners. The flavor in the food here is so authentic and delicious! Spice is no joke. If you enjoy authentic spice (and not packaged hot sauce) this is the place to go. The family operates this company are so genuine. They are so pleasant and treat you like family. Presentation of the food is done very well. If you dine in the restaurant and Mr Wong asks how was everything you hear the satisfaction in customers when they say if was amazing food. It truly is a great restaurant all around. My favorite is the basil fries rice. I never finish a plate so I take it home for the next day. Portions are a nice size and can be shared. Again best Thai food restaurant hands down in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had a real hard day today and wanted a place to relax with my husband.  So we decided to go to Pan Asian tonite.  The last time we were there it was ok, not bad. I enjoyed the atmosphere, so coming back was i thought going to be good again.  Well i ordered the mango shrimp salad, and when the waitress asked us how spicy, my husband and i knew better to ask what scale they used (we eat out a lot, especially thai!) whether it was 1-5 or 1-10?  when she said 1-10, we ordered it a 2! well when i recieved it, it was so spicy that i could no longer eat the rest of the food we ordered....i was disappointed but not mad.  i felt that maybe they did a mistake.  So i didnt make a fuss, but i did tell the waitress i was dying and needed water.  The waitress told the owner that it was too hot for me, so he said he would fix it,  But it was too late my mouth was on fire.  But this whole time, mind you i WAS NOT MAD, until the owner started to say stuff like it shouldnt be too spicy and that he didnt see anything wrong with the salad even though it was encrusted in red pepper,  and that i ate most of the shrimps so it must not be that bad!!  (it came with 3 fricken shrimps!!!) i started to feel offended by his remarks but still paid for dinner.  my point was not to not pay for our food.  i was ok until he started to talk.  Then he said next time to not order a salad with a 2! thats real spicy.  WHAT?????  then whats a 5 on his scale.  I just felt it had bad customer service and at this place owner is right, not customer.  To top it off the owner and his wife were yelling at each other while we were eating...... sad!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of pan Asian food, so pardon me if you find my review little biased! We loved the food. Specially, couple of noodles we ordered. On top of everything, be ready for one of the best hospitalities!"}
{"text":"*This is a tribute to Misti Y.*  I just HAD to go to Pan Asian before my Texas vacation, so I steered myself here which made me also have to go back to Patisserie Manon and buy every flavor of macaron to take on the plane back to the French mama.  The owners of Pan Asian are super sweet.  Chef Lisa has a great name, doesn't she?  I was the only one there, and I told them my friend Misti recommended them so highly that I drove from the other side of town!  Some things Chef Lisa and her husband said:  \"Misti sure has a lot of friends!\" \"Misti just ate here yesterday!\" ...and when I ordered the massaman curry with fried tofu, \"Misti prefers her massaman with steamed tofu.\"  So I smiled and giggled, and enjoyed that Misti is like the fabric of the restaurant (well, there are brick floors but you know what I mean).  The massaman was unlike any massaman I ever had.  I am used to thick, dark, and sweet coconut-milk based sauce.  This sauce was savory, almost buttery, and thin.  I am not sure how I feel about the butter instead of the coconut flavor.  However, it was CHOCK full of big chunks of veggies (potatoes, red peppers, green peppers, carrots, onions), crisp peanuts, ripe avocado, and then of course, the tofu.  The spice was right on.  I told them I was going to Thailand and Cambodia for my honeymoon and wanted to keep up with the heat.  My nose ran, always a good sign.  Lisa's husband told me he lived in Cambodia, and Lisa told me about her travels in Phuket.  The lunch special came with a canned drink, which I found out after I got Thai iced tea, so I ended up with 2 drinks.  However, I got my can of coke served with a straw, and for anyone who knows I drink soda through a straw, that is pretty cool.  I definitely want to come back and try other dishes.  The atmosphere is pretty and clean, the owners warm, the food spicy and tasty.  And even if Misti isn't physically there, she is definitely \"there\"!"}
{"text":"All these amazing reviews, I feel let down. With 5 people in my group, There should have at least been one person with a good meal.   Volcano chicken:  Horrible. Over-fried, crispy, and couldn't taste the chicken. We even had 3 orders of different spicy levels.  Chicken Pad Thai:  Weird. The noodles were pink(??) and had a fishy flavor. The chicken was basically flavorless.   Chicken Massaman Curry: Just OK. Nothing outstanding.   Bummer!! We really wanted to like this place, too!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is their menu doesn't have a million items on it, like many Thai restaurants do. It also appears to be very clean and you can view the kitchen from the dining area. The service was also great. The dining area is small, so I would think it fills up pretty quick at lunch and dinner time.  The Pad Thai noodles were the best Pad Thai I have had so far. The yellow curry was good. They make it with white potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, and onions. I ordered it 5 spicy and that was pretty hot. I might go for 2 next time. The curry was good, but I still think Archie's yellow curry is the best around Vegas. The roti with yellow curry I did not care for. Actually, the curry was good. It was the bread that I didn't care for. They use a flaky bread that is deep fried. I am use to having baked bread with my roti. I'm sure it is good if you like fried bread, it's just not my thing.  I will definitely be back for the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Mee Goreng, it was delicious! I asked for tofu, and it was cooked to a perfect crisp! I waited no longer than 15 mins for my food. The quantity was well worth the price!  Bomb ass stank ass Can't wait to wake up tomorrow watch some Netflix and eat my left overs."}
{"text":"You walk in feeling hopeful... you leave disappointed.  Pan is truly just meh.  We went on a Sunday evening, the restaurant was empty but we chalked it up to the cold weather.   We ordered the dumplings, lightly fried shrimp maki, drunken noodles and cheeks.  Dumplings were OK, but a fine enough start.  The lightly fried shrimp maki was averagely tasty, but I've had way better sushi at Sake's half off night in Southside Works.  The drunken noodles came with scallops.  The dish felt like it was full of salt, pepper, soy sauce and that is about it.  The noodles were also over crowded by vegetables.  I love me some veg, but the bok choy and immense amount of peppers overwhelmed the dish, I was basically searching for the noodles (which are wide mind you).  The cheeks is I presume supposed to be a take on pad thai with shredded pork.  It's hard to explain what was missing, but something just was.  After all of that food, we left with much to be desired... like need to grab a taco on the way home.  There are so many better asian restaurants in Pittsburgh, go elsewhere.   On a positive note, the service was good and I was loving the mo-town music station!"}
{"text":"Massaman curry! That's one great dish....a quiet small restaurant with a friendly owner and staff. I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"The food was solid, drinks were so so, and average service. We got the grilled Brussels sprouts for an appetizer and those were delicious. I loved the pork belly noodles and my girlfriend loved her dish. I'd recommend the place to friends but it's not a can't-miss."}
{"text":"What a charming little place! The moment we walked in we were greeted with a friendly smile. Wide open kitchen where our hostess was our waitress and our cook, which was great for describing how we enjoy our dishes (extra extra spicy for me in particular).   We ordered a chicken curry and the shrimp fried rice with a Thai ice tea and a Thai ice coffee. The food really is fantastic! Not too oily, fresh ingredients, tender chicken, delectably spicy! Great portions.. Was able to take a little home :) Definitely had that homemade-feel, which is always nice to have.  We will be frequenting this place! Kind workers and amazing food! You will feel right at home."}
{"text":"Pan Asian is a bit of a misnomer. This is one Asian restaurant that does not deserve to be panned. Good food. Great service. I'm definitely a fan of Pan.  The interior is pretty tiny. There is a meager total of 12 chairs in the whole dining area (which was 75% full while we were there). I'm not sure what kind of capacity they can achieve in that space, but if Dal Lat can squeeze in seating for 34 in their tiny restaurant, Pan Asian could probably at least double their current seating chart.  Anthony M and I both ordered the Massaman Curry - I went with beef while he got tofu. This curry dish is on the sweet side, but the heat balanced it out for me. It was a good serving size and I enjoyed everything about it. The large chunks of potato and carrot, the ample pieces of beef, and the flavorful curry all came together very well.  For some reason, the chef offered us some fried banana on the house. It was a generous gesture, but it strangely took a long time to come out and quite honestly, I didn't really enjoy it. It's probably a Filipino thing, but thanks to Turon, any fried banana that doesn't come with jackfruit automatically falls short.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely return to try other items. I was almost tempted to \"pull a Misti\" (yes, we are hereby coining a new phrase) i.e. I was tempted to come back for dinner on the same day. (I didn't)."}
{"text":"I love this place... awesome yellow curry ( with avocado) the flavors are just the best.  If you do not like very spicy please request a  low # for some reason #5 for them is almost like an  #8 in other places. Also for some weird reason their water  taste like soap, i would recommend you getting a Thai tea instead lol"}
{"text":"I did not receive my drink.  The driver said it wasn't put out, the person on the phone said the driver forgot it.  My yellow curry was only 1/2 full.  Don't order here. The restaurant did refund my drink.  Thank you."}
{"text":"ahhh I had to be a downer with all these great reviews for this place but I really didn't eat anything that remotely brought this place to 4 stars. (sorry Misti!!)  For starters we got suckered into ordering the Roti.  Pretty tasty don't get me wrong but for pan fried dough with curry dipping sauce, I didn't think it was worth the price PLUS the oil intake i had to consume with it.  I can only take in so much oil a week and would much rather save it for fried chicken.  I had the crying tiger for my entree which turned out to be overcooked tough slices of beef drenched in strange spices in an attempt to make the beef spicy.  The beef was topped on a bed of lettuce and onions with absolutely no flavor at all except the overly used spices.  Friend ordered the curry which was mediocre but a bit on the sweet side.   SOO many great reviews, maybe yall should try it for yourself but beware of the crying tiger."}
{"text":"I love this plas place.  The food is so good I cry when I have to cook at home."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Tamari's replacement during Restaurant Week, but were sorely disappointed by the quality of the food. The deal was for \"a bowl and a roll.\" We had the hanger steak bowl and the cauliflower red curry bowl. The hanger steak was tender, but the rice tasted like it had been doused in pure soy sauce--I think we went through 3 glasses of water trying to combat the salt. The vegetables in the curry bowl were beautifully charred from the wok, but there was just a watery red curry flavor on the rice--no curry \"sauce\" to speak of.   Onto the maki--we got the peppered tuna and the angry snapper. The angry snapper was pretty good, but didn't seem all that different from your standard spicy tuna roll. The peppered tuna was covered in a sticky-sweet sauce that hid the beauty of the fish...a real letdown.  The dessert was most perplexing--an avocado-yuzu creme brulee with tapioca pearls. The creme brulee itself was very successful and unique, but the tapioca pearls were ridiculously firm in the dessert--almost like chewing on grape seeds.  We'd give PAN another shot for happy hour and different dishes, but these dishes were quite out of balance and disappointing given the high standard set by Tamari in its early days. I will say that portions were quite generous, so the value is there, if not the quality. Service was quite amiable and prompt, so perhaps there's hope yet!"}
{"text":"No clue how this place is rated 4.5 stars. Hair in my pho. Awkward staff that watch you eat. Can I please just enjoy my food in peace please? Colleagues ordered panang curry which was mediocre. Definitely won't go back and stunned by the reviews."}
{"text":"It's our 4th yr anniversary and I persuaded my hubby to watch a Filipino movie which is only shown in summerlin theater, far from where we live. And I searched the area for a good restaurant that is not expensive. I read the reviews about pan asian and got convinced to try it and with the $20 for $10 deal it sounds really good.   We got there and greeted by the owner, very pleasing and smiling all the time, felt very welcomed. It's fish Friday so I ordered mostly seafood. Menu prices are all less than $10 but when the food arrived they look so fancy and elegant. I was really impressed and the taste is very good, not your typical Asian cooking where it taste good coz of MSG ... this one, their food taste good because it's fresh and true flavors of the ingredients. My hubby who is not a foodie like me was very impressed too and could not stop eating and after each bite he literally say \"this is so good\" in each bite he takes.   Even if this is far from our house, we would definitely go back here and buy more of the coupon deal. Calamari is very good, crunchy breading that is just the right amount of coating. Pad Thai is amazing, not the usual yellowish flat noodles in other thai resto, but the flavors are so good together I can eat the noodles by itself even without the meat which means even if I order chicken or shrimp pad Thai I'm sure it will still be very good. Red snapper was very tasty and the sauce super good.   Owners are very friendly and inviting, I felt like I was eating at home with Asian family ;0)"}
{"text":"The one downside of my new job is that I'm no longer as close to Pan Asian. I loved going to this place for lunch. The fried rice lunch special was my go to dish. Just the right portion size for lunch, delicious food, a great price, and solid service. Every dish I've had here has been amazing. Five stars without hesitation."}
{"text":"I go for lunch 3 times a week here.  Papaya salad, pad Thai, or Panang are all great.  Great service, great food, great time."}
{"text":"David Wong's Thai Restaurant is a gem in the area. Consistent delicious dishes, and top notch service.  You can never go wrong eating here. My favorite, pad kee mao or popularly known as Drunken Noodles.   Their curries are also amazing. Overall this is the spot to frequent to satisfy your Thai Food cravings."}
{"text":"It has been 3.5 years long years since we last dined at Pan Asian and not much has changed, that's good.  Lisa continues in the kitchen while Dave works the front, but both now have assistants.  We tried 2 new dishes that we had not ordered previously.  Both our basil chicken and rad nah noodles with shrimp (pan-fried flat noodles with Chinese broccoli with house special sauce) were delicious though a little light on the protein as should be expected given their pocketbook friendly price tags."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant indeed. Clean and tidy. Very friendly staff, food comes fast. Had the mix veggies with pork, taste perfect. Definitely a place worth a second or more visits.  Just read the review of a user initial JB, so here it is-- I am Chinese and I don't think I have bad taste in food at all. I liked the dish they served and I couldn't finish it all because the quantity was a bit too much for me, but the quality was really good. Enough said."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and service was flawless! I highly recommend papaya salad or basil sauce!"}
{"text":"Went there recently with a yelp voucher I paid for awhile back. Had the duck curry special and it was fantastic. The seafood soup was also delicious.  The tiger shrimp mango salad was great but the Vietnamese ravioli, while not necessarily bad, wasn't something I'd order again."}
{"text":"Eh. Ordered takeout and have been following for about a year bc of the reviews.  Had the fried rice, pho, pad se ew, and a meat dish. Don't get me wrong, this place is good, but I don't get why they have such rave reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome food.. Great place.. The staff is friendly.. Must try Thai tea :)"}
{"text":"Only recently heard about this place. The food was very good. We went for an early dinner (4:30pm)so there was no one in the restaurant but there were a lot of Bite deliveries. The restaurant is small and not at all fancy. The prices are reasonable and the veggies they use are very fresh. Everything we had was delicious and we plan on trying different items when we come back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great spirit ,owners friendly ,satay great,#41 with beef and glass noodles with chicken yummy! Glad we stop and will make the trip from Cali again! Been her twice now, and loved it!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with great service to dine in or pick up. They are always willing to make small accommodations. They don't use MSG, which my wife is very sensitive to. We used to live across the street and get dinner from there about once a week. We don't go as often now, but when we are craving Asian food, it is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food is very good and authentic. It is small inside and family-owned. They have open little kitchen and you can see them cook and prepare your food. I love their Shrimp Springrolls as they are filled with yummy shrimp and clear noodles. I love their curries and each order is prepared to order. I love that their curries have ingredients other Thai places don't like eggplant, Cabocha squash, sweet potatoes and avocado. They have brown rice as an option too. Their Pad See Ew was also very tasty and my friend ordered Boat Noodle Soup and it was very spicy and delicious! The family working there are always very nice. The only thing is the food takes patience cause it is a small kitchen with one wok and one stovetop. But good food is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious high-quality food! Everyone here is extremely friendly and I've loved all the dishes I have tried here (soup, all the curries, noodles, roti). This is at least a biweekly treat for us!"}
{"text":"Holy Effin-esse!  This food is belligerently good! I hate vegetables, as my +1 Michelle (I will refer to her as this throughout the review because she refuses to open a Yelp account, but had a blast with me at the CYME) can attest to, but Pan Asian is the exception!  After reading dozens of 5-star Yelp reviews, I developed a craving to try Pan Asian.  When we pull up in the parking lot we are a bit taken back by the fact that we are the only ones here.  We enter the restaurant and it is empty.  During our entire dinner only one patron came in to pick up a to go order and I have to admit... it scared me!  First off is the Gyoza.  Fancy name for potstickers.. with flavor and texture!  This app came out inside 5 minutes!  David (of David Wong's Pan Asian) was waiting on us and discussed, in depth, the ingredients and its masterful cooking process.  The Gyoza had true texture, something I look for in all foods. At first bite it was crisp, then soft, and then an influx of flavor.  Our app was in front of us for probably six minutes then it was devoured.  I was actually criticized by my +1 for eating the garnish.  I did not know it was not acceptable to also eat the carrots that were artistically placed on the plate.  Party foul on Rich.  Almost immediately upon our successful conquer of the Gyoza, our main courses arrived.  +1 ordered Clear Noodles and Beef, I had the Basil Sauce Stir Fry with Beef.  As previously stated, I am not a veggies guy.  To be blunt (#YelpConfessional) this is my first stir fry... in my life.  The flavor was disgustingly good!  I was gobbling up bell peppers like there is no tomorrow. The onions were perfectly seasoned, the... whatever else was in there... perfect!  Truly, absolutely, perfect!  I agree with Tien's review.  How can food possibly taste this good?  No explanation here!  Michelle's meal... wow!  I was offered a taste, which I could not resist, and it was just as impressive!  I have never been a huge noodle guy, but for every rule there is an exception... this was it.    My (our) biggest dilemma was the amount of mouth-watering menu choices and which we would eat.  We will be back (multiple times) and I cannot wait for the next visit.  As usual, the balance of Yelp is not wrong.  This place is freakin' awesome!  A true treat to eat, and the prices were incredibly cheap!  Gyoza, Clear Noodles and Beef, Basil Sauce Beef Stir Fry, 2 drinks... $28!  I have told 3 people about this place since dinner!  Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Thai style Asian food.  Unique flavors found no where else.  This is one of our favorite go-to mom & pop restaurant for the family.  Simple reason, and our son sometimes want stir fried noodle plates and other times get food envy and end up eating our entrees, we have to like most of the dishes on the menu in case he gets adventurous when he orders.  The spice scales here is serious!  Do not, under any circumstances, ever get beyond a spice level 4.  Trust me I'm Asian and I know these things.    My favorite dish:  Beef Pho Noodle soup, spice level 2, with extra slice beef.  It is pho noodles, but the cut of beef is slightly different than Vietnamese pho and the spices are more Thai style too.  Husband's favorite: Fish Pad See Ew, spice level 3.  The sliced fish is deep fried in a seasoned batter before being mixed into the plate of noodles.  It has very good flavor and adds texture to a plate of soft flat rice noodles.  If your kid eats spicy, get them spice level 1 here.  If not, don't just ask for zero, tell them your kid can't eat any spicy food.  Service, seat yourself and be patient as they do a lot of take out orders.  Chef Lisa is the chef owner along with her husband David.  Food is obviously the best when she's cooking in the kitchen and when David is working the front of the restaurant.  We've been there when neither of them are there and food / service drops to about a 4 star.  Highly recommend this for another who's looking for Asian fushion."}
{"text":"Just went here for the second time this week.  I'm so glad I found another great local restaurant that is semi-close by.  And especially glad to have a great Thai restaurant nearby.  The food is soooooo fresh and hot when it gets to the table, the flavors are fabulous, and David gives wonderful service.  I love the soups and every dish I've tried.  My favorite is the pad thai (with tofu).  Best pad thai I have had.  I will still go to Panna Thai once in a while because I like that style of Tom Yum soup, but I will be going here more often for everything else.  I haven't had room for dessert yet, but hopefully next time I'll have room for the tempura cheesecake.  My friends that I've gone with really enjoyed this place, as well, and they will be switching from their old go-to Thai places to this one."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Love the people there, and of course, the food. My favorites are the Pad Thai, Volcano Chicken, and Masaman Curry."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week and thought the place was charming. The service was on point- friendly, knowledgeable and timely. I had the sake cocktail which was excellent- the cranberry was perfectly mellow, not overly sweet at all. For the rolls, we had the lobster monkey and the scallop roll. Both were delicious. The tempura banana and mango habanero sauce with the monkey roll were so fun and unique. for the bowls, we had the drunken noodle and the duck special. Here is where the 5th star is knocked. The drunken noodle comprised of one large scallop sliced into three thin slices. The duck was a small portion and was pretty dry.  I won't say I'd order the bowls again, but i will absolutely be back for the cocktail and sushi happy hour, along with the excellent service which would absolutely be 5 star quality!"}
{"text":"I came here last week with a friend who was in from out of town.  We made a last minute reservation for a Friday night.  As it turns out, the reservation wasn't necessary, as the restaurant was fairly (and surprisingly) empty.  We got a table outside near one of the fountains and were promptly greeted by our waiter, who kindly gave us some time to chat and look at the drink menu.  I ordered a lemongrass mojito, which was lacking in lemongrass flavor, and my buddy ordered a Manhattan, which he said was good.  We ordered some shishitos at the same time as the cocktails - they came out insanely quickly.  Unfortunately, they weren't the best shishitos, and I actually enjoyed the little bits of brussels which were intermixed more than the peppers.  For dinner, we decided to split some sushi and then each got a bowl.  We got two rolls, the shrimp tempura and one of the nightly special rolls, which had mango, avocado, and spicy tuna in it.  The mango/avocado roll was quite delicious; the tempura roll was pretty much what you'd expect.  In theory, my pork cheek bowl was going to be phenomenal.  In reality, it lacked on the execution.  The meat itself was tender and delicious, but everything else about the bowl was fairly bland.  Overall, it lacked in the seasoning department. The sauce tasted something like a pad thai sauce, but thinned down. There was a little bit of cilantro, but not nearly enough, and the whole thing would have benefited from some additional salinity.  When the time came to pay our bill, our waiter had ghosted on us.  It took about 30 minutes for him to show up (after we asked for him) and he did apologize for forgetting about us, as he had been serving some tables on the second floor and got caught up.  Overall: Food: 3 stars Service: 3 stars Venue: 4 stars  Will I return? Yes, but I'll give them a little more time to work out their growing pains.  I'll probably go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Worth the wait, I even called ahead but still had to wait. YUMMY LUNCH MENU! I wish they had delivery to my office we would order once a week! Spice level was spot on! Only one server mid week lunch, but she was good. Kitchen slow to put out food. Tickets were lined up. One lady doing 80% of the cooking. Maybe that's why it's good."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. David and his wife are so nice. His wife is one of the chefs and you can tell she loves her career. We order the pad Thai that's a 10 and it's so good it hurts. Keep up the great work. This place is so clean and friendly. It's a must try."}
{"text":"I was craving pad thai and tom yum soup like crazy and they delivered perfection. It was amazing. The only downfall was the portion size. It was a little small, even for me, and I'm a very small girl, but I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at this restaurant for several years now. It is simply the best representation of this style of cuisine in the valley. Everything is delicious, my wife is particularly fond of the crispy duck and shares with no one."}
{"text":"How do you thoughtfully write a description of disappointment? Is it really worth my time to tell you about a disappointing experience at a place with a strange mix of reviews that primed me to accept a meal of mediocrity? Or does this solve a greater desire to be heard and this review is nothing more than self-affirmation, pandering to other, similarly worthless opinions about capitalism and internet reviews and why didn't Garfield Artworks ever clean up their bathroom?  Here is a boring and disappointing review of a boring and disappointing experience. The dumplings were soggy and drowned in sauce. They were lazily pan-fried, unintentionally deconstructed, and served looking like a bad science project. The sushi rice was off-putting. The fish were poor quality and my body told me to stop eating. I was glad to see a bit of seaweed salad served with the chirashi, but confused by the thick-cut jalapenos and avocado slices.  In a place expensive because of location, I expect a bit more. The vibe of the place doesn't really fit Tamari's contemporary/upscale environment that was left untouched when Pan moved in. They were playing a weird mix of white rap and alternative rock, but now I'm getting a bit picky in my judgments so I'll stop. Reading my draft of this review, I don't really want to publish it. I don't think it's very well written. Maybe I should end with some praise. The server was really nice."}
{"text":"Pan Asian is an excellent family owned and operated Asian fusion restaurant.  If you come at night, the first thing you will probably notice when you walk in is the harsh and very bright fluorescent lighting over the dining area. Like space ship bright. It would be so much nicer if they dimmed or completely changed the lighting. For lunch it's not really an issue.  The atmosphere here leaves a lot to be desired. Thankfully the service and food make up for it.   The service is excellent, waitstaff are super friendly and attentive. They are more than happy to answer any questions about the menu, suggest dishes, and honor special requests. The service is an easy 5-stars.  The food is really good. Here are my favorite dishes:  Mango and Tiger Prawn Salad 5/5 This is a very well balanced combination of flavors. It's sweet, salty, tangy, and savory. The greens and herbs were crisp and fresh, the shrimp grilled to perfection.   Red Curry with Crispy Duck 5/5 This dish is phenomenal. It's not currently on the menu but it's almost always offered as a special. This is the signature dish here and you should not hesitate to order it. It's a little expensive compared to the rest of their menu, but you get a huge duck breast that is easily shared by two people. The duck breast is dredged in flour and deep fried to crispy perfection. Okay, fried duck breast and red curry sounds too rich, but they way the curry is done balances this dish perfectly. The red curry sauce is light, almost watery, and along with the usual vegetables it also has pineapple chunks and fresh grapes. It works perfectly with the rich fried duck breast. Very clever and highly recommended.  Green Papaya Salad 5/5 This salad is awesome, but be careful about the spice level. Even if you order it mild, it's still very spicy. The papaya is cut shoe-string style and comes with a fish sauce dressing that is delicious.  The pineapple fried rice was pretty good but not great. It has a lot of flavor but it's extremely salty.   Overall, the food and service here are top notch. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are bold yet well balanced. The lighting and atmosphere hold this place back. It's not the kind of setting you want to be in for a romantic dinner and you would not bring a date or business client here if you want to impress them with a nice ambiance. Thankfully you'll forget about these shortcomings when you dig into the food, because it's delicious."}
{"text":"This place is small, and kind of far from the strip, about 15 minute or more drive (farther than it looks on the map). But the food is pretty good! i love how they have like chinese, vietnamese, thai, and whatever else kind of cuisine that i forgot.  And the waiter is sooo nice! Like moving-table- for-us-cause-we-were-a-group-of-10 kind of nice. And quite welcoming :) he asked us where we were from and if we made any money yet. Haha! We were all happy with the prices and they were very accommodating with a big group. No lunch specials on weekends though but that's a given! Good service tooooo!   Would come back here too! Try the pad see ew :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Pan!  Their drunken noodles are simply the best.  Also - happy to see they have added Poke as a staple, Chef Joshua Ross had it as a special, but after much prodding from some regulars, he added it back.  Love the balcony and the view of the city cannot be beat.  Only wish I could get their more often.  Try the Scottish Salmon roll!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, as they are very much in our neighborhood, and we've tried a few different dishes; classic thai fare, and pretty much all of their curries.  Their panang curry has pretty much set the standard for Curry I Crave. The chunks of vegetables are huge, and everything is perfectly cooked; no mushy potato but crunchy carrot. Everything's perfect. Caveat: I am a big fat wuss when it comes to spice, so while it might be too mild for some, it's just mild enough that I can sweat through it, but actually finish everything.  Great place for takeout, too, since they are very quick!  They are a little on the steep side for neighborhood asian food, but they are so high quality, and so unlikely to make my tummy upset, it's pretty much worth it."}
{"text":"I went here 5 years ago and wasn't as impressed.   I went here tonight and ordered the Tom Yum, drunken noodles and Crying Tiger salad.   Let me tell you, all Thai places I usually order as a 7 level for spice.   When this place says 5 is hot.... Listen to them.   For 20 mins I felt life back in my body as I internally begged for milk or ice cream.   Lots of flavor and great presentation.  Great spot."}
{"text":"Yelp comes through again.  Why, yes. This IS our new favorite \"I don't want to drive all the way to Lotus\" place. It's probably the only Thai/Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Malaysian place you're likely to find. If you can't find something to love here, McDonald's is right down the street.  Can't decide which particular Asian cuisine you desire? Well, Pan Asian has a little from here and there and it's all executed perfectly and...fine... I will say it ...\"kicked up a notch\". There are some little hooks in the dishes that show that someone in kitchen really cares about the food's history and heritage, yet wants to add a little nod to taking it even further.   I cannot wait very long before I go back for the red curry. There's something about pumpkin being included that just fascinates me. The avocado in my wife's massaman curry was out of this world. Once again, it's that little extra.   When have I had better fried rice? Never. (I'm not  a huge \"fried rice fan\", so it's not something on which I can have any sort of a baseline as I do with pork chile verde.) It was plenty for dinner and lunch the next day. I ordered it  spiced \"as the chef would make it\".   I am not Asian. I do not have to impress a cavewoman by eating blistering hot things and showing how manly her protector is.  The chef is a professional. This is kind of what she does for a living, so I trust her to add enough heat to complete the dish and not overpower the other flavors.  In this, she excelled. While it would have been too spicy for my wife, it was perfectly balanced.  Prices $4.95 for a bowl of Filet Mignon Pho. It's not the \"bigger than your head\" kind you'll get from the places on Spring Mountain, but you won't be wasting any of it, either. It was a great size to split for an appetizer.  The owner/waiter is the kind of friendly guy that just rocks as your host. Attentive, funny, and most importantly, genuine in every respect. It's not forced. You're in his house and he wants you to have a great meal. The chefs do, as well and you can tell they honestly appreciate the praise they so deserve.   Appetizers are $5 to $9. Entrees average about $10.  Some soups are $8. Most dishes are $10 and $12 for the ones with shrimp. Lunch specials are $7. (If only I had a job near this place!)  The table of six next to us all had amazing meals. We didn't see a single person that didn't thoroughly enjoy it there.   Now, go before everybody finds out about this place!"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because we only ordered 3 items so I can't rate it on their overall food menu.  The service was great but then again it was o l you hubby and I there. The girls who worked there were friendly and were always there to help service so that was a plus.    Chow Fun: tasted awesome and very flavorful. Got spicy level 5 and was pretty fiery!!! But delish nonetheless.    Sweet and Sour: meh.  We would probably order something else but worth the try anyhow.   Tom Yum Soup: loved it.  I'm very picky on this soup as no makes it the same but this one was great, I'd order this again."}
{"text":"We were regular customers of Pan Asian when they were in FL so we looked them up when travel took us to Las Vegas.  What a treat to again enjoy the warm hospitality and fantastic food that Lisa prepares.    Over the 2 yrs that we patronized their FL location, they got to know us by name along with all of our family members.  This weekend they even recalled various family members favorite dishes - including ours.  We didn't even have to tell them what we wanted to order!  I am not an expert on Thai food or any Asian dishes for that matter.  I just know when something tastes good.  The food is always fresh and piping hot.  I can't take real spicy, so they have always prepared it on the mild side for me.  We have tried many of their dishes.  I encourage asking questions because David will do his best to have you order the right thing for your taste.  One of the things we have always liked is that the food differs from time to time.  That tells us it is made fresh and not taken out of the freezer and microwaved.  For the sake of full disclosure, we didn't know David and Lisa when we first walked in their FL restaurant - just wanted to try the new local restaurant that opened in our neighborhood.  We now consider them friends because they are such lovely people working hard to provide a good experience for their customers.  Why can't all businesses be run this way?"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times within last few years. I had a good experience the first time I tried it. However, not for the last couple times.   I came here last weekend, and I was quite disappointed. In short, average service and way over seasoned food.   1. Red curry with beef. The flavor of the eggplants and pumpkins were fine. However, the beef was soooo tough. It was NOT Edible! It seemed like it was cross-rib roast or some part of meat that's meant for slow cooked. We left all the beef in the plates, and yet the waitress didn't care to notice.  2. Chicken satay. The quality of the meat or the way they cooked it was questionable. Instead of tender, the meat was chewy.   3. Basil fried rice. It was way over seasoned that it was too salty to eat and the rice was too saucy. You can't taste the right texture of the rice.   4. Tom kha gai. I did not enjoy the soup either. It was salty but not seasoned properly for tom kha.   The only dish that I was able to eat was pad kee Mao, and that was a bit over seasoned as well. I will probably not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had the chicken red curry here the lunch special. There was only 2 pieces of chicken & 2 pieces of eggplant & 2 pieces of bell peppers & the rest is sauce. It looks like it's half eaten. Idk if because it's the lunch special that's why it's so small. I will not b coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!  Great prices! I am sensitive to MSG and they don't put any in their food!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Somewhat expensive, but I'm guessing it's part of their upscale-ish image. I only had the lox fried rice and some unnamed sushi samples. Naming it salmon fried rice would be less pretentious since it was pretty cooked. The sushi creations were pretty imaginative and unconventional, very fusion-like with the flavors. I think I tasted barbecue sauce on top? I'm not sure if I liked that. Plating is aesthetically pleasing.  The interior is pretty and modern. If you sit at the bar you can watch the chefs at work.   (There are two 'bars' I guess, the actual bar in front of the alcohol and the one in front of their kitchen. The one in front of the alcohol is the one where you can see the chefs since it's from the side.)"}
{"text":"really enjoyed our meal here- we picked this \"hole in the wall\" Asian restaurant based on yelp reviews and it's close proximity to our house and we were not dissapointed. It's small and very casual but if that's what you're in the mood for- go here. The Tiger Shrimp & mango salad was delish! We were warned by the server/owner (?) that we should not order a high # for spice because it's not a cooked dish, it comes out really spicy. Holy crap, he was right. We ordered a 3 and it was SPICY and we can handle spice. So if you don't love spicy food- stick with a 1 or 2. We really enjoyed it though- if you don't like shrimp, it would still be a great salad without the shrimp- great portion size, 2 can share. We also ordered the Clear Noodles and the Basil Stir-fry. We were really happy with both of these entrees as well. 3 items was too much food for 2 people because the portions were generous so we had some to-go and no room for dessert. For 3 nice sized entrees and 2 bottles of water our bill was $32.   Note-they don't serve alcohol here and the server/owner told us, next time we can bring our own beer or wine. Overall: Really good experience- we will be returning and bringing friends for a good, inexpensive dinner."}
{"text":"A place we go on the regular was closed today so my friend and I decided to try another place out.  We Yelp'd!! around our area and found this place which came up first and had some great reviews.  We were super excited because we LOVE Thai food and curry is my favorite and the reviews for this place were awesome.   It's kind of hard to see from the street - which is odd because it faces the street.  The sign is hard to read and doesn't really pop so for those driving by I can understand passing it on your first try.  We walked in and the place was cutely decorated, but kind of a divey place in my opinion.  There is no air conditioning running, so I couldn't imagine eating anything spicy there!! I'd probably die.  The owner, David, was very sweet.  He was excited to have customers and wanted to make sure he made our food the way we wanted - he warned us of the spice levels as well!  I got a 6 and it was just perfect.  My friend is a spice FREAk and wanted an 8, but he warned her to try a 6 - she regrets not getting the 8!   I ordered the Massaman curry because of a review that said \"curry lovers must try this\" and my friend got the Panang curry (my usual fave) The plan was to half both of them and share.  To my dismay the curry was scarce.  It had great flavor, but when I poured it over the rice there were a ton of vegetables and barely any curry.  I was surprised because for $10 I feel like the container should be at least half way full.  I pay $8 at some places that give me 5 times what I got here.  It was very disapppointing.  I did enjoy the flavor, but I won't pay $20 for a full size curry.  Also, I love avocados so I was intrigued, but I don't think they belong in a curry.  Just an odd texture and flavor to mix...  We brought another plate of pad thai to go for my friends roommate and he says it was mediocre, nothing special.  Not to hate on this place, but just bein' honest :) It was A-ok."}
{"text":"Stopped into this cozy little family oriented Thai restaurant for some dinner with my favorite girl!   I ordered Calamari because it's my absolute favorite just about any restaurant I frequent. Ironically the calamari here was fried in cornmeal which was extremely odd and kind of hard to enjoy because the taste texture wasn't allowing me to do so. Not sure if I would order this item again.  Can't go wrong with some pot stickers and they were very filling and equally delicious.  The egg rolls were by far my favorite item ordered. Crisp, hot and so tasty!!!!!!!!!  I also ordered the Drunken Noodles with shrimp. The noodles were interesting looking but yummy and my belly didn't discriminate.  I'd definitely return and I sincerely appreciate the hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"We always order from here and the food is always amazing!! This time I ordered the beef pho which was awful!!! Actually it wasn't edible and ended up in the trash waste of money. I try to tell Eat24 but didn't hear back... oh well!! The other food was great I guess it was just my luck that I didn't get to eat dinner. Cereal it was"}
{"text":"I decided to stop last evening for dinner.  I had heard good buzzes about this place, but truly I wasn't impressed. The waitstaff was courteous and attentive, it was happy hour, and the sushi was good. The downfall for me was dessert. It was mentioned desert was freshly prepared on that day and would be avocado creme brulee. Yay!  Excitement lead to disappointment. There was a party upstairs that night and the chef had only planned enough dessert for the party. The chef had to account for all attendees before a dessert could be offered to other diners. Fair enough, but there was not another option available.   While this didn't pertain to me directly, but the bar ran out of Apple Pucker to make a drink. The manager had to run to the liquor store. It was a good way to save face, but it was Tuesday night.   I will consider other dining options in the area before returning."}
{"text":"I heard about this place a while back when they were in one of the Las Vegas Weekly articles. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time but it is very hidden. But this isn't about the location, this is about the food.   I am of Thai and Laotian decent and i would have to say this place is amazing food wise. My mother owns  and runs a Thai restaurant and i would have to say that how this place fuses flavors and showcases foods from various Asian countries is amazing.   I have been to all the Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley, even the bad ones and this is my favorite spot to eat. It is all about the Food here, I am certain if they had money to invest and a better location, this place would always be packed.   The food is great, vegetables not over cooked. This food is Real Thai Food. Archi's and Pin Kaow are good too but there food is geared towards americans. Try this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I live like 2 minutes from this place, so it's kinda my go to Thai restaurant besides Kinaree(Sahara/buffalo).  I mostly order to go and order veggie things.  My favorite noodle dish is the clear noodles with veggies and the garlic stir fry with tofu, both a level 2 of spiciness, lol.   I love that the clear noodles come with a good amt of veggies to noodles ratio, haha.  It's a good combination with the bok choy and the mushrooms.  The garlic stir fry is da bomb.  If you love garlicky food, then this is the dish for you.  The tofu is so crunchy and is complimented well with all the garlic in the dish.  Both dishes are fresh and I love how it's cooked in a wok.  The servers are very nice and I'm always greeted.  The owner is always there and if you're dining in, he'll talk to you and find out how the meal was. Give them a try, you'll like it"}
{"text":"dont order the pad thai here it tastes strange and the noodles are all stuck together . mannee thai had much.better pad thai."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  Komol will always be my favorite Thai restaurant for vegetarian food, but Pan Asian is the place to go in Vegas for their Massaman Curry, Pad Thai, and Papaya Salad.  So many other things are delicious on the menu too- you really can't go wrong. The owner is amazing too- he has an incredible memory and always remembers you... never writes down your order even if you're with a large group and always gets it right!  How does he do that???"}
{"text":"Went back again after a long absence.  Had some won ton soup and pad see ew.  Flavors were wonderful, as usual.  My only complaint is there were tons of little, inedible bits in both the soup and noodles.  Like pieces of pepper or skin from some aromatic.  I don't remember that being the case last time I ate there.  It's fine.  But kind of weird to have to fish out stuff from your mouth.  That being said, the coup was so flavorful.  I could have eaten 5 bowls.  And pad see ew as good as I've had."}
{"text":"Update: 8/4/2013 -  In Vegas again and returned to Pan Asian. The food was just as good, if not better than our 1st visit.   For appetizers, we had the Crispy Shrimp Spring Rolls and the Coconut Shrimp. Both were very good. The Coconut Shrimp was served with a dipping sauce that was truly amazing.  For the main entrees, I had the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango salad. The salad was perfectly prepared, all of the ingredients were fresh, and the shrimp was wonderful. The salad was light, but filling and full of flavor. We also ordered the Thai Chicken Spicy Salad, Pad Thai, and David Wong's Fried rice, all of which were fantastic.   Great food and service once again!  ***********************************************************************************************  After a few days visiting in Vegas, I was craving Asian food, found this place on Yelp and gave it a try. We were a little hesitant when we arrived because the place was empty, 0 customers (it was around 6pm on a Saturday). We gave it a try anyway and it was definitely the right choice. It's a small clean place, nothing fancy. It is very open so you can see the food being made as you wait. Let me tell you, the food here is awesome. Authentic, made to order, and full of flavor.   We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was great, cooked perfectly and very tasty. I was in the mood to try something different so I had the Massaman Curry (avocado, sweet potatoes, onions, and coconut milk and curry) with chicken added. It was packed with flavor and aromas. A great balance of flavors and I would definitely order it again. The family enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (my hubby said it was good, not the traditional deep fried version), the fried rice (shrimp added), daughter loved it, and the pad thai (it was great as well). You get to choose the level of spiciness for all entrees. My son ordered the pad thai with the highest spice level and it was HOT!!!. We had the fried ice cream for dessert and it was super.  The owner was extremely nice and added a personal touch to the experience.  I will visit this place for sure again."}
{"text":"Saved the DAY! The best hangover cure is some spicy tom yum soup! I am literally sweating. Pair it with the chicken pad tai & spring rolls, SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I Love this place.  It doesn't hurt that my office is within walking distance and I eat there probably twice/week.  I enjoy all the currys with steamed tofu, since I'm not a meat eater.  The papaya salad is also Delicioius."}
{"text":"This only gets four stars because I only tried one dish here, I wasn't very hungry at that point.  I'll probably bump it up to five stars the next time I go.  I got the shrimp with basil sauce, my friend got the chicken with basil sauce.  I got a heat level of 5, but I'll probably bump it down to a 4 next time.  It was spicy enough to make my lips tingle, but not hot enough to make me stop eating it.  Yeah, that's good.  I would like to try their other dishes, especially the ones other reviews have spoken of, like the red snapper.  Side note: Their spicy level is based on 1-10.  Apparently the wife (who is the cook) likes her dishes with a spice level of 30.  Talk about hardcore."}
{"text":"Every dish we had was great. A group of four of us shared the mango salad, sweet and sour chicken, and a couple appetizer type foods."}
{"text":"We must have came during an off day. Only party there but service was very slow. Decent food but a little pricey and all portions"}
{"text":"The family has been planning to come back since our visit Mothers Day.  I figured since I've been twice in a row this week, I should write a update.  I planned to have lunch with my mom and grandma in law and they were suggesting to come back. They wanted the Stir Fried Linguini and Massaman again. This was definitely a test in consistency and it was right on and just as good. This time the massaman had avocado pieces which made it even better for me! I also tried the Chicken Tom Khar. Lisa (chef/owner) came and said it wasn't coming out the way she wants with consistency since she changed and tried a different coconut milk. I thought it was still good as the flavor of the spices came through and made up for a lack of creaminess from the coconut milk.   I guess the BF felt shafted we went without him so we went for lunch the very next day. We had pork pad se ew which had a great flavor. The noodles were a little sticky, but I rather like sticky noodles than the usually greasy treatment of this dish at other places. We got chicken red curry. This is different than most reds I've had, less thick and a bit more watery but the flavor is much more complex. I loved the addition of eggplant and squash to this dish as those went well with the curry flavor. I love meat, but I equally love vegetables that are fresh so it's a big plus for me that the curries here isn't all sauce and meat. The BF and I had a good talk with Lisa about her food and a bit about their past restaurants and such. I loved that she said that since they don't have overhead they spend it on proper good ingredients because it's about the customers. That good food needs good ingredients to become a superior dish. If only every single business adopted that instead of cutting corners on ingredients they might have solid dishes and avid fanbases! And it's not like she is just saying that....we can see her cook and I see that their ingredients are quality (like our Thai Tea had organic Horizon milk) and fresh (herbs from their garden, fresh kefir instead of dried they obtain from LA, Melissa's produce). Considering the quality for the price, it is a steal of a meal! Many places charge about this much for much less quality.   I LOVE this place! It feels so comfortable to dine here with how friendly they are. It's like being in the Wong's home.   This is THE BEST Thai food I've had in the city and reminds me of some great Thai food giants in Los Angeles (if you didn't know- has the largest population of Thai in the US) solid Thai home cooking. I thought Thai Grill solved all my Thai food answers here in Vegas, but I think this has definitely bumped to my number one.  I rarely endorse a place this hard, but if you are gonna read any of my reviews and decide to go to a place, I hope I influence you to give this humble place a try.   A small UYE coming soon so check the calendars!"}
{"text":"I met my brother for dinner last night. I really wanted to eat on the beautiful patio in front of the restaurant, but my plan was thwarted by the rain. The interior was very nice, though a little dark, but had really cool art on the walls. Very visually appealing. They had a TV at the bar, which was strange to me since it felt so upscale(ish). (Or is it?!)  I had made a 6pm reservation. We were seated immediately. We ordered drinks, I had the Lemon Grass Mojito... I'd totally order that again! (I'm a big fan of Mojitos!) By the way 1/2 off all drinks from 5-7pm on a Friday, can't beat that! We shared the Angry Snapper Sushi Roll and it was sooo good. We also each ordered a 'bowl'. I had the Drunken Noodles and my brother had the Pan Pho. Admittedly neither of us can use chopsticks, so they supplied us with forks. (Did I lose your respect?) The first 10 bites of my drunken noodles were great. But it seemed like the never-ending bowl! Is too much food a thing!?!?   I just feel like they are caught between being an upscale location or being a trendy hipster spot in Lawrenceville. I still don't know if I had a fancy dinner or a big bowl of tasty noodles in a cool restaurant. The food was good, service was fine. I'd come back for happy hour and sushi rolls for sure!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, since it's right down the street and boasted a menu that seemed similar in theme to Tamari but slightly more budget friendly and casual.  The first time I ate here, I was optimistic.  I had the drunken noodles, and although I found them to be a bit too heavily soy sauced and salty, overall the dish seemed reasonable and I chalked it up to opening jitters.  Unfortunately, my next several experiences with the restaurant (which were all take-out orders) did not inspire confidence. I tried several dishes, including entrees and sushi. The sushi was OK, but definitely overpriced for its quality.  The noodle dishes often left me very disappointed.  In two cases, the meat had an off-flavor to it.  I have given this restaurant lots of chances, but at this point I don't think I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is such a find! Have been here many times and literally everything is amazing!!! The pad Thai is the best I've ever had and the beef pho with garlic is killer. Also love to order the panang chicken for lunch, super tasty! Make sure you don't order it too spicy because they don't mess around when it comes to spice. I love spicy food but find myself at about a level 3 for spice when I'm here. Definitely a gem!! It's kinda of out of the way for us but soooo worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing soup I have ever had delivered,  plus it was 30 minutes early! Flavorful broth,  just purely delicious. I would highly recommend! I had the Phone and wonton soup,  and a Thai tea.  Everything was amazing. Anytime I am sick this will be what I order."}
{"text":"Food and service were terrific! Ordered hot, 10 of 10, I have been looking for a place that will load up some spice and this place knows how to do it. Ordered the basics. Gyoza, tom kha, tom yum, pad Thai and Red curry with chicken. Best Thai in Vegas that I can find."}
{"text":"Pan Asian is a neat little place that I only found lately.  I believe the wife does the cooking, and everything I have had so far has been great.  The people I have gone with all enjoyed their meals also.  She even made me something not listed on the menu.  The husband is nice enough, but likes to call people \"boss\", which is a pet-peeve of mine.  Other than that he is pleasant and always checks up on you enough without being overbearing.  It is close enough to go to for lunch with coworkers.  The amount and quality of the food is a great value for the very reasonable prices.  Really clean place too.  Great tasting, high quality food, inviting atmosphere,  and prices that won't break the bank.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Always good food delivery this time was a little late and subsequently food wasn't hot still tasty as always thankfully"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was an overcooked mess.. and the \"pho\" was different this time. It was definitely better the first time we decided to dine here. I think their quality is pretty low.. it's such a shame because it's a quaint little hole in the wall looking restaurant...  They also need to clean their spice trays. They keep reusing them without washing it every now and then and you can see some of the sauce has dried on to the lids and the glass containers."}
{"text":"Ever taste something that just seems like it was crafted molecule by molecule to match everything you love about food? Here I am, a lanky white guy, thinking I must have been Thai in a former life or something. Let me explain...  First, you have to try Pad See Ew. I know, if you're not familiar with Thai food it looks like something you'd scream out if someone threw up on your shoes...it's not. It's made with flat rice noodles, vegetables, and meat/seafood, I usually get it with pork or chicken but y'know, whatever floats your boat. TRUST me on this... you want to order this dish. It sounds generic, perhaps a little plain...yes, I know it does...it's not. In fact, when you do order this, you're going to want to punch everyone you know in the face for not telling you about it sooner.  Mr. Wong is the chef and he makes the best Pad See Ew I have ever had. I gladly sacrifice any chance at being in shape or watching my carb intake in exchange for the opportunity to shovel this stuff into my mouth hole.   The restaurant is tiny, laid out weird and you can't help but watch what's going on in the kitchen as they prepare your food. This man is all about the fresh ingredients and quality food. I haven't had much else on the menu but it could be the one item and I'd be just as happy."}
{"text":"Pan really lives up to the Asian fusion by having creative and unique dishes, as opposed to other places that are just a hodgepodge of generic dishes.   I tried the Chiang Mai Cauliflower. Expected it to be a little more saucy, but still had excellent flavor. My date and I also split a sushi roll.  Very attentive service, almost too attentive, but it was a Wednesday so the place wasn't crowded.  The excellent ambiance, both indoors and on the patio, and decent pricing makes this a great date spot!"}
{"text":"So we finally made it to Pan Asian!  I am happy to say, that it does not disappoint! Chef Wong has some very delicious cooking here! He was also very friendly and came to talk to us, and said he made the basil special just for us by cooking it and searing it...which really made it fragrant and added a nice consistency! I will ask for it like this next time for sure!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#JCVcxvcLGhlfJivt4Ceoww  The drunken noodles (pad kee mao) was my most favorite way I've had this dish! And I order this EVERYWHERE I go! Chef Wong was NOT afraid to add spice, so it was a good heat and excellent flavor, especially with that basil!  The \"Basil sauce\" (pad ka pao) was good, and also had a nice heat behind it, but I really like it when the chicken is minced into very small pieces...the meat really absorbs the heat and all those juices in the sauce that way. Since these were large pieces of chicken and there were tons of green beans in there, this wasn't my most favorite way of doing it, but still good!  I don't think I've ever had more green beans in a dish before lol :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#-JTA2XZWeNY5X5T58roGSQ  And lastly, the pad thai was also good. It was a little on the sweet end, but we normally don't order this dish, so I can't really compare it to others in town. It seemed like it had a better taste though than we have had before.  It also had a great presentation :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ek0n6bBZNz8W77UAGB17JQ  Overall, this is an excellent place to check out, especially with their lunch specials and great food!  Prices are a little cheaper here than most in town, but the servings are a tiny bit smaller too, so it works out overall.  I am not sure if I can jump out and say it is my most favorite in town, but with them making the best version of drunken noodles I've had, I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I think the constant high ratings yelpers give this place made me expect something incredible. But I am only giving it three stars and a half."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai red curry #43 was good (5 hot out of 10) , papaya salad was so so and the drunken noodle was good. Flavor lacked a little this time around. Service was great like always. I will be back again"}
{"text":"Wonderful personally prepared food and cocktails! Had the kale salad, Chiang cauliflower bowl and Pan Thai w/pork belly bowl. All very delicious and ample serving sizes too! Sat outside on patio but 2nd floor outdoor must be tried with view of downtown."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Amazing sushi, entrees and desserts.  The drink selection was very unique and the pork belly was prepared with Japanese sweet potato and out of this world.....delightful.  I'm coming back soon. There is really no where in Pittsburgh that compares"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Penang curry and grilled squid were the best. Also, they are a wonderful couple."}
{"text":"Best food in town! Not just Thai food, but everything! Owners are awesome. Service is great. And then there's the food...wow! Panang curry is unbelievable...how does anything taste so good! And the volcano chicken is a close runner up."}
{"text":"Last week I bought a Groupon for the new restaurant PAN to celebrate my friends Heather and Ben getting engaged. I wanted to go some place that was close in our neighborhood but a bit fancy. I have heard good things about PAN from Nextdoor and from other Lawrencville friends so I thought it would be a nice place to celebrate.  It is nice when the first time you get to go to a restaurant you get to save some money too! The Groupon was $40 for $80 dollars worth of food. Really I was a little hesitant because I didn't know if $80 would be enough for 4 people, boy was I mistaken.   I made a reservation on OpenTable for 7:15. We were promptly sat in the \"lounge area\". My friend came early and was hanging out there and we just decided to stay. They have really comfortable chairs back there and accommodated us by pushing the smaller tables together. At first I was like, \"ummm....are we really going to eat like this?\" It turned out to be really fun and a relaxing way to eat. The chairs and the tucked way atmosphere allowed us to laugh and have fun and had a feel that we were in our own little area.   How we did food was we just ordered plates and would get them and then order something else. We ended up trying a lot of great things this way and since it was staggered the tables were not full so it was not overwhelming. Our waitress Monica was really good to us. She had a ton of suggestions and her ideas on substitutions were on point each and every time. Our table loved that she was around to offer advice but wasn't hovering. She was awesome.   Small Plates: Dumplings: pork, napa cabbage, ginger, sesame, soy. We didn't go crazy and try something that bizarre. We ordered a pretty standard appetizer. Dumplings. The dumpling plate came with five dumplings (I ate the extra!). The sauce was pretty standard. The dumplings were plump and the filling flavorful. I was surprised that the dough was a bit thicker than I usually have had with dumplings. The thick dough was not a distraction but something different. We liked them. I would say that they were standard and a good thing to order to please a lot of people.  Pan Maki:  Barely fried shrimp: light tempura, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, jalapeno miso. YUMMMY. I loved the fried shrimp with this roll. What flavor! This roll was a hit with the table. Our waitress Monica told us to sub in some spicy mayo. Yes, yes, yes. What a good idea. This roll was a little large and hard to handle with the chopsticks (wait, is that a bad thing??). I would definitely suggest this roll. It was enough for us to have two pieces each. Yum.   Dragon:Eel, tempura, avocado, crab, scallions, eel sauce. This is my go to roll. I love eel. I will pick this roll each and every time. I kind of slipped it in as a choice and didn't ask the table. I know, it was bad of me BUT it turned out well and everyone liked it. Again, the roll was a little bit large, but again not a problem. Very flavorful and I loved the eel.   Even though dragon is my go to I really think that I would want another of the barely fried shrimp. WEIRD! I really enjoyed that roll....I kind of want that now.   Meat Plates: Korean fried chicken: Fried chicken, wasabi slaw. THIS WAS AWESOME. The fried chicken came in three large thigh pieces. Boneless. THANK GOD. The boneless kind was awesome because we cut the pieces in half and each got a half and then a quarter. The chicken was fried to perfection. Perfectly crispy and so juicy on the inside. The sauce was spice and a bit sweet. I liked to just get a little bit more on my piece and would just rub my chicken piece on the plate...I was not the only one that needed more of that goodness. The wasabi slaw was also on point. We all kinda wanted more of that. It had a lot on the plate, but another scoop for us would have been nice. It was great and crunchy. Awesome!   Kuro buta belly: schezuan braised pork belly, butternut squash, buns (and a little tomato/onion with balsamic vinager drizzle). Monica suggested us to make a little sandwiches with the pork belly and the squash. This was a great idea. The pork belly was a large square that covered the half of the bun that we each got. I made my little sandwich with some onion/tomato and the squash. I will say that that squash was surprising and delish with the pork belly. The squash was something that I enjoyed so much that I kept on taking swipes at it. These little sandwiches were really good. I think that Pan had some of the best pork belly that I have had in a really long time. The slices were thick and large. The schezuan sauce was not salty and had a nice mild flavor that did not overpower the pork belly. Get this, you will not be disappointed.   Bowls: Chang Mai Cauliflower: thai aromatic rice, roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, crispy tofu, coconut & red curry sauce. . Monica suggested we sub chicken for the tofu. Do it. We needed more meat in our life. This was something that I let someone else order and then looked at the menu a"}
{"text":"Vegas has weird weather at times and last week it was windy and cold, the perfect weather for soup. I just didn't know what, and I didn't want to go far for it.  I asked my cousin and he suggested Pan Asian.   Looking at the menu, everything listed looked so appetizing.  I wanted to try them all.  My budget for that day for lunch wasn't more than $6 so I ordered Tom Kha soup made with coconut, chicken, some different herbs I've never seen or tasted before, lemon grass, and amongst other things.    It was the exact kind of goodness I just needed on a cold windy day.  The sour taste was just perfect and not overpowering the whole dish.  Everything together was combined well.  The service was also comforting as the employees all were very patient, and easy to talk to.  It's also great to be able to speak with the chef.  It's rare that chefs talk to their patrons anymore.  It definitely was a nice change.  I am curious about their penang curry and the other curries they're serving."}
{"text":"Very nice.  Good service.   Cute waiter.   Very nice food.  Generous tapas.   Fresh ingredients.   Nice drink selection.   Fair prices.  Need better music.   Too much coldplay and red hot chili peppers.   I will return."}
{"text":"We have been coming here at least once a month for the last two years and it is always a consistent 5 stars!! Food consistency, food quality, service, price, everything 5 stars.  David and his staff know how to run a restaurant.  Favorites are the Garlic chicken, Mango Pan seared salmon, filet pho, mango and sticky rice and the donuts!!"}
{"text":"I eat here so often it is almost like my home kitchen. Sometimes, I just go there without even knowing what I want, and then describe what I am craving, and boom! It arrives on my table. I most recently was in the mood for a spicy stir fry, something with a deep wok flavor and a kick. I ended up with the Black Pepper Chicken served on a bed of vegetables. It cured my craving like woah."}
{"text":"Pan Asia is good!  I love their salads!  Beware that they do traditional Thai spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love David Wongs...decided to get take out for a party and everything was amazing. We come here often so it was nice to share with some friends at home. Volcano chicken, Pork Robs with XO, Pad se Yew, Crying Tiger (watch out here go above a 3 and you will be crying)"}
{"text":"Very stuffy \"hipster\" atmosphere.  Started off with 2 happy hour apps of Korean fried chicken and spicey tuna makki. The chicken was excellent, thigh meat served with a spicey peanut slaw.  The makki, not so good.  Fishy and  very bland.  Our \"dinners\" then came.  I ordered the bbq hangar steak. It was delicious, cooked perfect, but only around 3 to 4 ounces!  $15 for 4 thin slices of cheaper beef and a fork full of seaweed salad.  My son got the \"full\" order of the fried chicken which had 3 small pieces.  My wife ordered the hanger steak pho and it was awful.  Beef way over cooked and the noodles were cut into small pieces making it difficult to eat. Overall the food was good, service was average.  Would certainly not return. Bill was over $60 with tip and we ended up stopping for pizza on the way home due to the skimpy portions."}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly staff everything is fresh. Noodle soup is great lots of meat not loaded with veggies like most. And I love hot food but this place takes the heat scale to a new level so lower your usual number but those of us who like hot this is your place. Wish the menu had a larger selection of conventional Chinese options just because I'm sure they would be great"}
{"text":"The people made me feel welcome, excellent service. Food was delicious. Atmosphere is good for a nice quiet evening."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place based on yelp reviews. It was the best Thai food that I've had in Vegas (yes, I been to Archie's, Pin Kaow, Lotus of Siam). I'm from Chicago and started my love of Thai food there. It was then cultivated in San Francisco for 10 years when I moved there for work. So, I would like to think that I know good Thai food. I ordered the pad sew ew and the massaman curry both with tofu and at level 6 of spiciness. The husband, David(?), said this would be spicy...is that ok? It was, and they both were delicious. The noodle dish is my \"go-to\" Thai dish and I tried this curry dish over my usual go-to, yellow curry. The reason I picked this one is it had potatoes and peppers (like yellow curry) but, it also had....nuts, cashews I think, and ..... avocados! Yum-I don't think I've ever had avocados in my Thai food before-it worked.  They have other types of Asian dishes but, when I saw the Thai stuff, had to try it. I would definitely recommend as it was really good and we need to keep these good mom and pop places going in this crap economy."}
{"text":"I miss Tamari a lot, so I had to check out what PAN was all about. Two friends and I had dinner here at 9pm on a Saturday night. Wasn't crowded at all.   We shared the Angry Snapper sushi roll and all liked it a lot. It's perfect for those who can handle just a little bit of spicy, but might be slightly disappointing for those who are expecting a lot of spicy. We were almost going to order seconds, but decided to save room for our entrees. I got the braised pork belly, which my friends thought was really good. I thought it was alright; couldn't eat too much of it for some reason, probably because I wasn't a fan of the butternut squash it was served over. If it had ginger in it, the taste was too strong. If there was no ginger in it, then I have no idea what it was. (I know there was cinnamon and nutmeg in it though because that's what the chef said.) One of my friends got the pan pho and said the broth and meat were bad but noodles were good. The other had the drunken noodles and said they were good but too salty.   When we were ready for dessert and inquired about the menu, we were disappointed to hear from our server that she didn't have anything for us. Well...okay. Not even an explanation of why no dessert was available? Awkward end to our meal. Awkward end to this review. (I'd much prefer Tamari.)  Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 4 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3"}
{"text":"Pan Asian is in my opinion hands down the best Asian food restaurant that Vegas has to offer. It's a little hidden gem that hardly ever seems busy but wow! The food is great, I keep going back to either the Pad Thai or the fried rice, they are both fantastic! The service is phenomenal and the owner is almost always in the restaurant and knows many of his customers by face, if not name. Be ware though, when they say spicy..they mean SPICY! A spicy level 2 there is comparable to a 5 at other Asian places..so a 10 is hot hot hot! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant by far!"}
{"text":"We came here and  ordered the pork spare ribs and the duck curry. Adding green grapes into the curry was an ingenious move and I loved it. The curry itself was light, perfectly flavored and just simply delicious. The spare ribs were equally yummy as well as the baby bok choy that was in the dish. I can't wait to come back here to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a tiny shopping plaza on South Durango Drive it is likely that many have driven past David Wong's Pan Asian dozens of times without even noticing the Restaurant is there, and yet in reality the kitchen has been serving the West Side of Las Vegas for over six years while also amassing a fairly large number of Chefs and industry folks who consider it a part of their regular dining rotation.  A Husband and Wife operation, he the business end while she does the cooking, it was as part of a group of nine including two children that several smaller tables were combined to form one large space on Saturday night just past 7:00pm, the arrangement accounting for more than half of Pan Asian's Covers on this particular night though at least three-fold as many came and went over the course of ninety minutes with call-in or online orders.  Called Pan Asian based on an embrace of several styles of cooking ranging from Vietnamese to Malaysian to Thai, the menu having undergone many changes over the years based on old pictures and reviews found via Social Media, Autumn 2017 continues to see David and Lisa largely focused on Thai dishes such as Drunken Noodles and several styles of Curry, a chalk board of specials hanging overhead adding another five or six choices to a double-sided laminate with prices so low that one wonders how the place continues to offer such large portions without having raised prices more than a few cents over the last few years.  Employing one additional server in addition to the Husband and Wife in the kitchen, her demeanor exceedingly pleasant as she kept up with water and share-plate requests effortlessly while also packaging and acting as cashier for numerous take-out orders, it was after a lengthy perusal of the options and accounting for two guests deferral of Pork that a two-course order of nine plates was requested, five Thai Tea's and three additional orders of Rice pushing the total bill to just $22 per adult including tax and tip.  Using good ingredients and working as a very small team, Mr. Wong joining Lisa at the stove to make sure everything came out as requested in a short amount of time, it was after no more than fifteen minutes of talk as one of the youngsters watched College Football on the television that the first five plates were delivered 2-2-1, the Green Papaya Salad starting things off with a good bit of heat at \"Level 6\" while the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli felt a little one-dimensional with Celery blunting the flavor of both finely ground Chicken and Shiitakes.    Immediately happy that someone had suggested Thai Tea to begin, the Sugar and Cream helping to quell bold spicing when transitioning from plate to plate, it was immediately on the heels of the Ravioli that two plates of Flat Noodles were presented next, the Pad See Yew recommended by Carson Kitchen Chef John Courtney packing a lot of funkiness thanks to the fermented Black Beans but still letting the thin Beef show while the Drunken Noodles bested World Famous Lotus of Siam in terms of not only flavor, but also by possessing less oil and a lower price.   Rounding out the Noodles with thin \"Linguini\" stir-fried similar to the Pad Kee Mao but with Asparagus Tips in place of Green Beans it was with share plates refreshed that a trio of Curries plus a generous portion of Basil Fried Rice were next presented, the Rice an all-around crowd pleaser with plump Shrimp and chunks of Chicken Breast hidden amidst Grains that were generally fluffy but occasionally crisp plus plenty of spices and good Produce.  With many at this point already starting to get full and family-style helpings decreasing dramatically for some it was nonetheless with wide-eyes that all took in the golden Duck resting in a pool of creamy Pumpkin Curry, the $21.95 daily special $6 cheaper than Lotus of Siam and far better executed with plenty of crispy skin and supple Flesh to go around, the sliced Beef in both Green and Panang Curries also very good though fairly similar to one another save for the fact that the Green version was a bit more spicy while the Panang was subtly nutty.  Finishing off the remaining Jasmine Rice with residual Red Curry, only a few spoonfuls of the Green returning the kitchen at meal's end, it was with most too full for Dessert that the check was requested, a shock to all when everything rang-up at just over twenty-dollars each including tax and a 20% tip for a lot of good food, attentive service and such a pleasant evening.  Called by two independent local Chefs \"a hidden gem\" while several at the table lamented having either never known about the place or having not been back in so long there is no doubt David Wong's Pan Asian belongs on the short-list of Las Vegas' best bargain dining in addition to receiving some \"Best Thai\" nods, though obviously both the size of the space and the menu indicate David and Lisa have no interest in challenging the likes of Lotus or Chada.in terms of breadth or creativity."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Asian restaurants in Vegas.  It was a bit far from the strip but it was all worth the drive.  The owners are very friendly, courteous and accomodating.  Will definitely be a repeat customer :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting my best friend in Vegas and met her for lunch here. I let her do the ordering because she obviously knew what was up (she comes here like once a week!). Honestly, I had low expectations because it's totally unassuming, but OMG their pad thai is sooooooooooooooooooooo so so so so good! Saucy and flavorful and so damn fire, I loved it!!! Might even be better than the pad thai at my favorite spot in Thai Town, LA! I also really enjoyed their tom kah. Would highly recommend Pan Asian for anyone in Vegas craving bomb Thai food."}
{"text":"This is the spiciest food I've ever eaten, save for the moment I bit into a grilled jalapeño. I grew up eating spicy food, and I always sigh when I order a 10 at other restaurants and it still isn't hot enough.  The owners, David & Lisa, are so kind and accommodating. They cook with a true thai spice level. My other favorite thing is how fresh and unique the vegetables are in their curries. The red curry includes  pumpkin; yellow, with sweet potatoes; massaman, with avocado. I rarely eat beef, but the flavor in the \"crying tiger\" beef salad is on point. Combined with the spice, I'm down for a few bites.   There isn't a dish here you'll regret ordering. They've perfected it all. We tend to order some sort of appetizer/salad and share two entrees. There's more than enough to enjoy the next day."}
{"text":"we came on a monday and ordered 2 lunch specials, beef pad thai and chicken massaman curry for 18.  - overrated. as much as it kills me to say it since i love small mom and pop restaurants, what we ordered did not deliver.  - seeing the old man fist explode with a regular customer was nice to see :) - pad thai with wrong noodle. they cut corners and use the pho style noodle. disguised it with coloring. lol. pink? -___-. texture and flavor is off. - i ordered massaman curry bc everyone on yelp loves it. i must say, it is pretty good, but for the price, not. a 6 is a good level for those that prefer medium hot. avocados in curry was a surprise that i enjoyed. carrot pieces are too large. - I like rice. small bowl of rice doesn't cut it for filipinos. lol - I might be harsh since there is one thai restaurant in socal, president thai (rowland), that gives tom yum, fried wanton and pudding as part of the lunch, with a bigger portion AND at a cheaper price...but what can i say, bigger competition there...nuff said."}
{"text":"been in Vegas for over a year and Panasian is hands down the best Thai food I have found. I tried several Thai restaurants around town and none compare to David Wong's food, everything is very authentic. Drunken noodles are a MUST. Also the staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Pan Asian and I was shocked how cheap the prices are on their menu.  Entrees are pretty much $5-10, appetizers less than $8.  We got roti, chicken pad thai, drunken noodles and beef panang.  The roti was nice and hot - fluffy and a bit sweet...perfect for dipping in curry.  The pad thai was redder than most places' version but equally as good.  The beef panang was also great - lots of veggies and the curry was tasty.  Then there was the drunken noodles which Shawn got at spicy #10 - now,  I don't like spicy food but it was good and I liked it a lot.  I just had to wash it down with lots of Thai iced tea!  My nose was running because of it.  I'd order the drunken noodles again but at spicy #5.  The service was also great.  Very attentive and always with a smile.  The place is clean.  Overall, the food was good and I was not disappointed especially with the prices being low.  Great food, great value!"}
{"text":"I just order the Pho. It was Thai-style. It lacked the heat and some of the herby delightfulness that I love in the Vietnamese version.   The restaurant is small and family owned. I showed up about 15 minutes prior to closing. They didn't make me feel like a jerk for coming in so late. They actually we warm and welcoming.  I can't wait to give the rest of their menu a go!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the great reviews on yelp I decided to give Pan Asia a try. Walked in and was immediately greeted by David! he helped me understand exactly what I was ordering since it was my first time there. After 10-15 minutes food came right out. Ended up loving everything I ordered. Few days later Took my mom to try it out might I mention she is a very picky eater but I knew she would love this place and she did!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great people. if you havent tried this place your missing out.. Ono Grindz.."}
{"text":"We couldn't get over the amount of sodium in this food! The flavors all meshed together, and the only thing that stood out was the curry. The Thai chili sauce tasted like a salt lick and I felt my blood pressure rise at a taste. This tasted like an all American kitchen trying to make it taste like Thai."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a long time and decided to give it a try since it seemed their menu was very extensive and it had Chinese - cousin from SD was in town and loves Chinese food.  Long story short, the menu wasn't that extensive and was most, if not all, Thai food items. It was mediocre and tasted like how it should - I got the Pad See Ew and cousin got the Basil Fried Rice - 3 for spicy level was too spicy and he likes bit of a kick, so probably stick to a 2 or a 1, he was sweating bullets throughout dinner.  Pretty disappointed because I was really looking forward to some Chinese menu items but none appeared."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very nice and friendly service. Just visiting LV right now but I am sure we will come back. Just be careful with the spiciness. It can get very spicy very quickly!"}
{"text":"I tried a lot of Thai places around Vegas, Pan Asian is in the top 3.  We ordered takeout for pineapple fried rice and pad see-ew... very good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Quick wait time when picking up. The pho is my favorite. Watch the spicy levels though."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a long while now .. and I did! TWICE even before I decided to write a review!  Pan Asian is quite a quaint place. It's not a huge establishment -- it's actually quite tiny. It has about 5-6 tables only so if it gets busy, it'll be real busy.   The first time we went, I decided to go with their stir-fried linguini which had asparagus, tomatoes, bell peppers, garlic, chili, basil, and your choice of meat. For me, I decided to choose chicken with it. I guess you could say something like, \"That's not a thai dish!\" \"What?! Go to thai restaurant to eat non-thai dish?!\" Psh. Don't be a hater. And I have to say that ... it was not a bad decision at all to order the dish.   You also get to choose your level of spiciness for your dish. The range goes from 1 to 10. On yelp, there is this tip from Roger that you have to go spicy or go home. So guess what I did? I chose level 10. No, I didn't do it as a challenge or for \"fun\" -- I mean, who does that for fun anyways? Let's set fire to my intestines so I can laugh while it's happening. I personally love spicy food therefore, I gotta go spicy or why am I even there?! The server was nice enough to warn me. She asked if I've ever eaten there and that their level 10 is really really spicy. I will not back down! You will not scare me! I still went for a level 10. Then a little bit later, the cook himself warned us about the spiciness of level 10. I love you guys! But give me my spicyass food!!   The linguini .. was delicious! It had a very interesting and different flavor to it. I do believe that he uses satay sauce to stir fry the noodles and with the spiciness of the peppers, it was delicious. I just love how it's not huge chunk of pepper flakes in my bowl. A lot of other thai places will tell me to get a lower level of spice and if it isn't enough, I could add in pepper flakes myself. Gee, that just means one thing. You use pepper flakes to cook your food instead of using actual peppers.   My friends, on the other hand, ordered curry and pad see ew. The curry didn't really catch my attention when I tried it. Their pad see ew was really good though. Very good aroma. Though, for pad see ew, I would probably suggest not making it spicy. It doesn't really do it much good.   As for the second time we went, I was thoroughly surprised that the server remembered me. We decided to try out their tiger prawn shrimp salad and the server goes, \"What spicy level do you want? 10?!\" I was surprised but I laughed. She remembered me! I guess not a lot of people order level 10 there. But I eventually settled with a level 5 for spiciness. I know.. I know.. LEVEL 5 ONLY?! What! Why didn't I level 10 that !!?? Well, for one, salads are a completely different story when it comes to the spiciness level. It's almost doubled ... plus, I was sharing the dish with my friends. I'd rather not send them to the hospital with fiery intestines.   The dish, however, was delicious. A level 5 was the perfect amount of spice. It gets that fire in your mouth going. The prawns they used also did not taste like they were frozen shrimps. They tasted pretty fresh and the way they lightly grilled them on the side was really good. Really yummy dish and I think it'd be perfect for summer!  As for my entree, I decided to go with a pad thai at level 10. I opted out for the peanuts and carrots cause I don't care for pieces of peanuts in my noodles and I just hate carrots. The dish was very good, but, I don't think it's better than the linguini in my opinion. There was nothing that sets it apart. It's a tinge of sweetness and I think because of the sweetness, it's not as spicy as it could be. Though, it is a progression of heat so as you heat, the hotter it gets. It's the best kind of spice :D !!!   The only things keeping me from giving Pan Asian five stars is because I'm thoroughly confused. When reading the menu ... you kind of question yourself: is this a Thai place? A Vietnamese place? A Chinese place? etc etc. They have a dish or two from different Asian cuisines. They even have hainan chicken! What the??   The second thing is their thai tea. WAY too sweet. It had no tea flavor. No go!   Overall though, it was a delicious experience. And I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Small Asian restaurant serving Thai and Vietnamese to Chinese flavored dishes. I went there on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was empty, the owner took my order and the food was pretty good. I also received good service and refilled my drink without asking. I had the coconut shrimp as my appetizer, a nice large shrimp dredged in coconut flour then fried to a golden crisp. I also has a small bowl of filet mignon pho which was quite tasty with really good flavored broth. My main dish was garlic pepper shrimp with vegis, it was good but for me the coconut shrimp and the pho was the star. All three dishes including and ice tea was $30. I did notice some cheap lunch specials there between 11am to 3pm."}
{"text":"Crunchy Spring Rolls 5 stars Thai Iced Coffee 5 stars  Pho- 1.5 stars, +.5 for presentation. It just didn't taste like pho and was wayyyyy too spicy (I like spice). I didn't even eat it.  Service 0 stars. Our server (Girl with glasses was way unfriendly) not sure if she was having a bad day but it wasn't very welcoming for a first timer. She also left (as in went home) without telling us and we waited for our check for about 20 minutes not knowing she took off. Not cool.  All in all I'll maybe and that's a major MAYBE order another take out order of spring rolls-that's about it for now."}
{"text":"Over indulgence on spectacular food is easy at Pan Asian. My sister is back in town and I have my eating partner back. We share the same philosophy of sharing food to maximize our chances of trying multiple dishes and sometimes to cut back on calories. We will even order one dish at one restaurant and move to another to try something else.  Not here at Pan Asian. We sat down and ordered enough to keep us full the whole day. They are running a special with Yelp, a $10 for $20. This is steal because you can get a whole lot of food for twenty. We started off with their famous chicken wings. 7 or 8 large meaty wings came out, fried to perfection, and NON-BREADED. I hate breaded wings because they get soggy fast. These were some of the best wings I have ever had. They come with a side of thousand island. My sister and I normally don't like mayo, but we lightly smeared on a bit. If that was not enough, I had ordered the level 7 Tofu Massaman Curry. It was no inferno, but it had the creep up on you heat. There is a genuine point to their scale. I am tired of ordering a ten and wondering where the spice is. The sweet potato were soft, the avocado creamy, and the tofu lightly fried. In the end, the sauce was all that was left and I ended up spooning that on top of the Fried Clear Noodles. My sister even ate a full bowl of rice because the curry was just that good. Most of the time she eats half a bowl and feigns being full. I am beginning to learn that usual habits will go out the window when you enter the door.  It was cool because we witnessed them filming a segment on local eats. Look for Doreen Fang's blog to watch the spot on Pan Asian. There were some delays in order being made because of it, but it was like being in the audience of a cooking show. Speaking with Doreen after was awesome because she is putting a lot of emphasis on local mom and pop shops."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened. My boyfriend & I can't get enough of their Crying Tiger Beef Salad. The first time we got a 5 in spiciness & it was wayy too much for us & we actually enjoy spice! Now we get a 2-21/2 & it's perfect. Can't find anything to compare to this salad. Mmm!!!"}
{"text":"Made a long overdue return visit to Pan Asian the other day and am excited to say they have retained their 5 star ways.  Had mostly done take out in previous ventures there so decided to have a nice sit down meal which allowed me to explore some of their off the menu specials.   Had an incredible Tilapia Red Curry which was worth the $10.95 and then some.  The spice levels still throw me off a little.   I didn't even throw out a number and simply said \"medium\" and was still clamoring for refills every few minutes.   That's by no means a complaint, but just a warning to anyone ordering for the first time (even though it's been emphasized several times already throughout the other reviews...)  Also, I'm currently obsessed with Iced Tea but avoid Thai Tea due to the dairy elements.   I mentioned this to David and he got me a regular Tea (which is not listed on the menu).   Since the Thai Tea is presumably made from the regular tea + \"other stuff\", it's not like this was some crazy special order, but for those who share my iced tea obsession, it might be useful to know."}
{"text":"Got takeout here while on the road. It was fast, they were really friendly, and the food was amazing and very reasonably priced. I got the red curry, which was great and they have a good spice range. So if you crave spicy food like me, they can definitely meet that request."}
{"text":"Finally! A great Thai place close to my work that handles takeout orders fast and efficiently. I used to get takeout from Archi's but it proved to be too cumbersome with the order mistakes and time having to wait once i arrived. Pan Asian blew me away! The pad see ew that I ordered was delicious, hot and generously portioned. I called the order in as I left work and by the time I walked in it was ready. The cashier recognized me somehow because he knew where I worked, and no I didn't have my badge on! Service was friendly and I was back to work at my desk within 20 minutes of when I left. I am so going to start trying this places other dishes."}
{"text":"For those who like to just get to the bottom line. Great food and delicious. Prices are okay for the west side. Of course, there are other cheaper options but then not on the west side.  For big eaters, one entree might not be enough for you and the quantity of meat used is very low.  Overall, a great tasting food."}
{"text":"Place was good--we ordered pad see ew, crying tiger beef and pork curry.  Rice cost extra 1.50.  Not easy to find--had to map it.  No one else was there and seating was a little awkward and you feel you are being watched while you eat.  Owner and cook are very friendly---there aren't too many main dish meat selections.  Mostly noodles and soups and mostly Thai.  Satisfied but will not be back unless in area or there is another yelp discount or groupon."}
{"text":"David Wong-he is the Bomb! just ate here fo the first time and the Food here hands down is awesome it's a cool lil spot and the service is exceptional to the food! I'll come back here and try and order everything !  If you've only heard of this place now, go in and order, pretty much everything is bomb at this point!"}
{"text":"Pan Asian replaced a falafel restaurant. We were the only customers at the time of our visit. We ordered the spring rolls which came on a bed of wilted , limp brown spotted lettuce which made me worry if the Red Snapper we ordered was going to be fishy. The fish was fresh but was extremely small in size. Considering the plate cost is $22.00 it was very disappointing. The veggies that came with the snapper were also limp, a sign that they were not fresh. All in all pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"Thought I'd leave a review since I eat here on the regular. Best Thai place in Summerlin. You can't really get a bad item on the menu but my personal favorite is the Chicken Pad See Ew. Servers are sweet and fun to talk to. Beware of the spice, a 3 is like a 5 here. They do Thai the way Thai should be done."}
{"text":"It's been a little while since we've been here, shame on us! The menu is a fusion of Thai and Chinese and there isn't anything on the menu that isn't fabulous. There were four of us. We ordered the mango shrimp salad to start, then two whole red snappers that were flash fried then sautéed in a spicy Thai chili, ginger, with a tiny bit of sweet craziness. I had the meaty pork ribs that were more like short ribs with a crispy bark and a ponzu like sauce over Baby Bok Choy, it was stupidly delicious  We had an order of the DW Rice which had flavors that would keep you up at night just thinking about how good it was. Finally, a mango coconut curry over Salmon, so tasty! The place isn't large, the ambiance is a B, but the service is an A."}
{"text":"Pan Asian is a place where it fully deserves its high rating on Yelp. The service is excellent, the food is freshly prepared, and the atmosphere is casual, yet inviting.  Try the homemade red curry or lad nar (red nah in some Romanizations on menus). You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's. The food is amazing and it's reasonably priced. Try the shrimp tom yum, u won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ilo e this place. Fast and friendly service. The food was grate the most expensive item on the lunch menu is $15. I've had chicken panang 4 star is a little spicy but I love ot. I ve also have tried chicken pad Tai  3 star. It was good but I wanted a little more spice so I uped my stars this time."}
{"text":"My wife and kids and I love this place. David is the chef and it's probably the best Thai place I have ever been. Prices are good and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Great service and unbelievably delicious food! We had the Wonton soup and Filet Mignon Pho and the flavor was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I tried three items from David Wong`s Pan Asian, and I'm still deciding what I think. It's not bad, and others rave about this place.    Won ton soup: The broth and vegetables were nice. Bok choy must be the prettiest vegetable on earth. The dumplings/won tons were not enjoyable, though, and they are the heart of the soup. I found them to be absolutely flavorless.    Fried tofu: I've had fried tofu before, in tofu massaman.  Separately, however, I hated it!  I can't blame the restaurant for this- I may just not be a fan of fried tofu. It had NO flavor whatsoever. Thank goodness for the attractive, slightly spicy and very tasty sauce  that came with it, otherwise I might have thrown the tofu away.  Massaman:  The potatoes were fully cooked, and that's important, since almost every massaman I've had in restaurants included undercooked potatoes. These potatoes are attractively cut, too.  I also detected thick carrots and - possibly- sweet potato mixed in with a few pieces of chicken and bell pepper.  I was disappointed in the thin sauce, and wish the portion size had been a bit larger. The flavor was all right, but I've tasted massaman elsewhere that I liked much better.  My friend tried the pho and loved it.  The delivery guy said this is a popular restaurant, so I'll likely try it again to see what everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant; food is pretty good and the service is okay too but I do have an issue:  It is always really freaking hot in there!!!  Its summer in Las Vegas - figure out how to get that place cooled down!  I'll go back in the winter and see if its better.  Seems to be an issue with a lot of Asian restaurants here in town - hot as crap out side and the AC is barely working.  If restaurant was more comfortable I'd give it a 5"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pan Asian, which was highly recommended by a Thai blogger, Dan P.  Our group  tried the Papaya salad, (they were happy w/) and the big hit was the Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad, which I had everyone taste and the all loved.  The only thing I would complain about is no liquor available for sale;("}
{"text":"If you like Asian food, you have to try this restaurant.  Fresh, delicious,  reasonably-priced food, and great service. They have a little bit of everything, and everything we've had was really good.  The food is beautiful, and you can tell that the owner really cares about presentation.  Everything is always really fresh, and the vegetables are nice, and crisp (not frozen, or overcooked). We've been here twice so far, and we've tried quite a few things.  The curries, and noodle dishes really stand out.  The soups are really nice as well.  I really loved the pho, and coconut chicken soup. One of my favorite things at this restaurant (so far) is the tempura cheesecake dessert.  They didn't have it the first time we came, so the owner surprised us with some free deep fried ice cream instead (also delicious).  All of the people that work here are really friendly, and attentive.  They've even gone out of their way to make off-menu items for us. They have some great lunch specials too, so I will definitely be back soon.   :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The good food is always fresh with awesome flavors. If you do Thai then you gotta come here. Try the curry's... Everyone I've had has been ridonkulously good. The papaya salad is the BOMB too!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, i gotta say the Malaysian roti thing was really  good specially the sauce but i have had it cheaper at other places, Then i had basil fried rice which was one of the better ones I've had, being a big Thai food fan. My friend also got the Thai linguine which was good but nothing to be too excited about. My favorite was the Pa cha with thilapia that's a must have. Unfortunately the duck was off the menu that day so might be back to try that another day. I have to say price vise i have had cheaper Thai food at few other places just as good as this, but this is one of the better place. I think most of the food is Thai based even though it says pan asian, except for the linguine, ravioli, roti and few other stuff."}
{"text":"This family owned hidden gem is a win win for the entire family! We consistently receive great service and the food is always delicious. You will not be disappointed with your lunch or dinner here!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the laid back feel and suggestions by what seemed to be the owner. The red curry was spicy but not overbearing and the various veggies complimented the fish nicely. Rah nah noodles were different in a great way! The owner gave us a powder and pickled jalapeños to add to the rah nah if needed. Jesse isn't the spicy eater that I am. The pickled jalapeños were to die for. Certainly will be back. A tad expensive for a non-fancy Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"I am sorry I am used to another type of Thai. I dunno but I hated the pad Thai, I could not eat it in fact. The service was great and the place was pretty nice and clean."}
{"text":"I had sake for the first time today-- and on draft! Incredible.  I loved the dog friendly patio, and general vibe was inviting and classy.  I can't wait to come back for a great dinner with friends and experience more of their menu!"}
{"text":"There are obviously plenty of Thai restaurants all around town so it's fair to say the best way to judge Pan Asian is via comparison and obviously the key comparison is with Lotus, especially since a former Lotus chef is involved. I will say that while I would prefer to go to Lotus if it were the same distance from my house, Pan Asian is some of the best Thai food I've had in the general Summerlin area. The restaurant is small and modern but doesn't seem to get particularly busy. Ate a few things:  Gyoza- pretty good, very crunchy and freshly fried. Linguine- very flavorful and filling. Don't be fooled by the Linguine it's no Italian dish it was very much Thai flavored just with an unusual noodle choice. Tempura Fried Cheesecake- lol I mean obviously this is gonna taste awesome but it's execution was a little off. The closer you get to the center of the cake the colder and harder it becomes since they basically just battered up the cheesecake and dropped it in the fryer. Would still eat a million of them though.  Priced reasonably well, around 10 dollars an item. I chose spice level 5 and it definitely had a good amount of heat to it. Will be returning until postmates or seamless let me get lotus every day instead."}
{"text":"SOOOO DELICIOUS! Thai Spicy Chicken salad - AMAZING, with delicious fresh mint, the Drunken Noodles, some of the best and freshest I've ever had (and it's a favorite dish so I've tasted many versions), and the Chicken Satay- also super delicious with a fresh peanut sauce- even my picky toddler loves! To top it off, both the manager and owner are exemplary with their customer service. Our family will definitely be ordering regularly from here. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and visited Pan Asian during our last night in Vegas.  The food was amazing, service was great. the place was pretty empty for 7pm.. which was great because we didn't wait at all !  I would definitely recommend to a friend and will be coming back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of the Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, and Pan Asian is by far one of, if not, my favorite.  The food here is some of the freshest and most authentic Thai I have ever had.  The cook does a wonderful job of using the freshest vegetables to make each dish.  The flavor in each dish has been fabulous.    Today I had the Red Curry Duck and the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle).  The Red Curry Duck was amazing.  They use an entire duck breast cut into slices and they lay it across the curry.  It was amazing and full of moist juicy duck.  Well worth the price!  I also love the pineapple and grapes used in this dish.  I always get it very spicy, and the sweet mingles with the spicy just right every time!  I also had the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle) dish.  I asked for it spicy so she added some red peppers to the dish and it came out wonderful!  The heat level was perfect for me.    When I go to a Thai restaurant, I ask for the dishes Thai style.  This is one of the places where she will actually make the dish as \"Thai style\" as it gets.   If you want authentic Thai that is fresh, delicious and at a good price, give Pan Asian a try!"}
{"text":"Right next day coming back from my 6 week trip to Korea, I was craving for Thai Food so badly (had enough of Soon-tofu Jjigae and Kim-chi back home :) :P  Well, I've been told that this new Thai restaurant is so great that I should try it as soon as I return from my vacation. I was dying to try this new Thai Restaurant in my neighborhood and glad that finally I tried out!   I shared two dishes with Mr Tea' for lunch; Panang Curry & Crying Tiger  The Panang Curry was really good and tasty.. I enjoyed having my Panang Curry not too sweat and it was just right!  The Crying Tiger was a dish that I tried out for the first time.. It was a handful plate of green salad with lots of red onions and grilled steak. The flavor of lime, garlic, chili, and fish sauce were very strong. But I love fish sauce in general,, like often used in Vietnamese, Thai, or Korean dishes. I thought the dish was little bit salty to me since the main ingredient was a Thai fish sauce but,, honestly it was better in taste after try it out over the Jasmin Rice that we got it for the curry.  I can't say too much about this place yet, but I love to go back and try many items from the menu. The price is about the same as any other Thai Restaurant in town.  This place will be definitely one of my favorite restaurants to grab a lunch or dinner.....   So why do I want to rave about this place...the chef, the food, warm smile by staffs, and the friendly service.. Oh, YES~~life cant get much better :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers! I was visiting in Las Vegas and had no idea where to get some good food and where to get away from the buffets. Read the reviews of Pan Asian and decided to try it out. Great food! Had satay and pad thai with chicken. Yum. Went with my son, so we shared both dishes. The pad thai was medium, which was perfect. The owner had just returned from vacation and talked to the regulars around us about his trip. Very friendly casual good place."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan for mom and pop's places. It is really a hidden gem. Love the food there! Whether I check in here or not doesn't matter. This place is always my must go whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place!! I have been there twice so far & have loved everything I've had! The lemongrass mojito & spicy margarita were amazing. All of the sushi rolls were great. My favorite meals overall were the pork cheek bowl & the pork belly entrée, both to die for! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Phoenix area and I wanted something fresh, healthy, close by, and a little spicy for me and yet still okay for my husband who isn't so spicy friendly.  This little place on Durango near our hotel fit our desires perfectly.    Firstly, it is clean.  It is always the first thing I notice.  This place is very well kept.    Secondly, you can see the kitchen so it is an open concept.  Be wary of a place afraid to show you their kitchen.  The smells as we walked in were wonderful and tantalizing.  Made me even hungrier and I was already hungry.  Third, we were greeted by the prettiest little girl.  Okay young woman, but to a 49 year old she is still a girl to me. :-) she sat us at our table and was our waitress.  She answered all our questions and gave me suggestions when I asked for them.  She was very helpful.  I decided on Drunken Noodles with Chicken (heat level 3 - thanks to another customer she suggested I go for a 3 instead of a 4 - so thank you Ms. customer for your suggestion - you were right!) and my husband ordered the garlic basil stir fry with chicken (heat level 2).  Their heat scale is 0 - 10.  Just to warn - their 3 is more of a 5 to me but I am a white girl born in Nebraska so take that to mean what you like.  Just saying, maybe ask for a lower heat then if you want more heat you can always add to it at the table.  Now for the taste!  My husband said it was the best stir fry he has ever had and he hands down loved it.  I tasted it and he is right - it was really delicious.  I loved my Drunken noodles with chicken.  The veg (green beans, red and green peppers, onions, Thai Basil) was fresh and cooked perfectly - hot all the way through with a nice crunch to it without being the least bit raw.  The noodles were perfect and the chicken was sliced thin and very tender.  The flavor was spot on great.    If we lived here I would make it a point to frequent this lovely little restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has amazing thai food! We usually get take out because the ambiance is just okay, but when I need a thai food fix, this is the place I call. The Malaysian Roti appetizer is pretty much incredible! We always get their pineapple fried rice and chicken pad thai also and we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"After a couple of mediocre experiences, I decided to try this place again. I ordered a dish I had before that was pretty good, the Cauliflower with brussels sprouts and tofu. After I started eating it, I pointed out to the waiter that there were no Brussels sprouts so he promised to bring me a side dish of them - I ordered the dish primarily because I love sprouts. He returned to my table only to tell me that they were out of brussels sprouts. I would not have ordered the dish if I had been told this in the beginning.You don't serve something without the key ingredient without telling the diner. A total waste of money in my opinion because I didn't get what the menu described."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and decided to try this place out after all the reviews from yelp. I was doubting it first, thinking it would be a  run of the mill Asian Fusion restaurant. However the food was far better than expected. We had a party of 6 and devoured everything. To top it off the service was extremely friendly. After the meal don't miss out on the deep fried ice cream. It might sound overbearingly sweet and kind of mismatched coming from an Asian specialized restaurant but its definitely worth it. I highly recommend this place. We're definitely coming back when we go back to LV"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've returned to Pan Asian, but I don't know why.  This place still serves up some great food.  My friends and I came in for lunch on a recent Friday after a morning of training; food tastes even better when it's recovery food, IMHO.  The lunch specials are still a good option. We shared the still fabulously refreshing tiger shrimp mango salad and I had the chicken panang lunch.  My only gripe is that brown rice is $2.50; really?  I am not willing to pay that much.  Other than that, I still love this place and I really won't wait so long to eat here again."}
{"text":"Made a last minute Saturday night reservation at PAN and were easily able to get in. As far as decor goes, not much has been changed from the previous Tamari. Additionally, the music from the bar was blasting making it very hard to hear conversation, one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves. However, wait staff was friendly and very attentive.   We ordered the edamame, dumplings, and dynamite shrimp to start. Great to share, and the flavors were there. For entrees, a few ordered sushi which they thoroughly enjoyed. I tried the Pan Pho, with great flavors and not the traditional soup Pho that you'd expect. Unfortunately, my friend ordered the Hanging Tender and had to send it back for re-fire as the steak was almost raw. In general, the food was good but it didn't blow us away.   Overall good, but not great. May return, but with so many new concepts coming to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, it won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices. Even cheaper with the yelp deal. The owner and chef are really friendly.   Be careful when you rank how spicy you want the food. An 8 on spice level at this restaurant is equivalent to a 10 at most other thai restaurants. I got the Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad, Tom Yum Soup, and Pad See Ew. All were delicious."}
{"text":"We placed a delivery order. Everything we got were so good! Love love the Mango Shrimp salad!! They get it to your house right on time."}
{"text":"The couple that owned this restaurant was super nice. Service is super slow. I ordered take-out and it took 30 minutes. When the food finally came out, the girl that bagged up the boxes took even longer! Sometimes you don't need to take your sweet time!   If you can imagine being on the verge of almost missing a flight and waiting for this food... it was a horrifying experience. The curry was good, the Pad See Ew was okay. Not worth the wait unless you have all the time in the world.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Eating the food borders on having a religious experience. I got the Malaysian Yellow curry with fried tofu set to a heat level of six. It was fabulous. Great vegetables. Perfectly vegan. Gail got the Masaman curry with avocado and loved it, too."}
{"text":"What a great little place to have a meal! I took all 4 kids here to eat and all of the food was great! Spring rolls were delicious, served with the lettuce and mint leaves...so good. We ordered a second order, the kids loved it. We had pad Thai, beef basil, pumpkin curry, satay chicken, pineapple fried rice... All good! The beef was real meat...it wasn't like the rubbery pretend beef you get at a Chinese restaurant, it was certifiable meat! All the food was extremely flavorful. We picked a 5, medium heat on some of the dishes but it was way more than a 5 and I love super spicy but it had some kick there. The daughter that ordered the pineapple fried rice wasn't raving over it...that's her go to dish at all thai places, she says it was a little on the mushy side. Other than that, everything was great. The food comes out quickly. We asked for a take out menu and she said they didn't have one. I would have like to have had one, I have a drawer full of them and when I see the menu I remember they exist, so she may have lost some take out business from me as I thumb through the all the menus when I'm hungry...out of sight out of mind."}
{"text":"Me and my girl friends came try many different dishes here because I got a groupon to here. I was kind of disappointed with how much the food cost and the quality of the food. It is way over priced! I like all the sushi I've ordered, which is angry snapper and another one with tuna and avocado. But it is not worth the price. If I come back, I probably will just get the sushi."}
{"text":"Rarely am I impressed with the variety and quality of vegetarian/vegan options on a menu. Most restaurants will throw a few vegetables together for an entree to proclaim themselves \"vegetarian-friendly\". Nope, that doesn't cut it for me. Then PAN comes along and changes the game. They brought the creativity, the pizazz. When I have to stare at a menu for more than 20 minutes to decide which of the many vegetarian options I want, that's when you know this is the real deal.   We started with the Naigamo Poutine. Finding vegetarian poutine in Pittsburgh is harder than finding Nemo, so when I saw this bad boy, I knew I had to try it. This is not your traditional poutine. It's got a quirky Asian flare that surprisingly works. The yam fries were delicious, and the miso gravy complemented it so well. A must-try!  After attacking the poutine, it was time for the Chang Mai Cauliflower. It was a medley of my favorites: tofu, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts. It was spicy enough to give it a kick without the uncomfortable burn. Insanely delicious! I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a good rice dish. Additionally, their portions are huge. It tastes great AND two meals for one? Just take my money. All of it. Right now.  The downside to PAN is probably the price as others have pointed out. Not too overpriced, but more than your average Asian restaurant. It's a nice spot for a special evening, but not somewhere I would drop in on a whim. I'm coming back for you, PAN. Hopefully, with a bigger paycheck."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy!!! What's nice is that i never seen Thai curry with lots more vegetables! Very tasty too!Wonderful little restaurant with nice decoration;) you can even have a romantic little date;)"}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  The duck with red curry is the best. Duck is crispy on the outside juicy on the inside. The curry is full of flavor. Be careful of your spice level I ordered level 8 and was pouring sweat but didn't want to stop eating because it was SOOO good. My favorite place to eat"}
{"text":"If you like Mom and Pop shops this is your place! Good prices and good food. We ordered The Pad Kee Mao (spicy) and Basil Sauce with Chicken. Both were very good and at a very reasonable price because we bought the Yelp deal. ;) I would definitely get it, so you can try more dishes.   The server was very nice and knew my friend with me from a previous experience, which definitely helped. :) I think I will go back with him just for the royal treatment.   The only thing is I wish the dishes had a bit more spice, I think I ordered a 6 star, but it was bit mild. :( Next time I will order an 8. BRING ON THE SPICE!!"}
{"text":"I had walked by here many times and always felt as though it would be too pricey or upscale for me. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is intimate and cozy.  Food is well prepared, nicely presented and really good. Everything that we are was tasty and the drinks are also nice.  Looking forward to going back to try out the weekend brunch specials."}
{"text":"Very nice cozy place. I got the ginger black bean sauce stir fry with beef and I really liked the beef. Veggies are just so-so. But there's a lot of other stuff on the menu that I must try and I will update review later on for that.   My friend also got the cheesecake tempura with his entree and appetizer and he pretty much loved it. I'm not a cheesecake fan overall but it looks pretty good.   I've still got to try the crying tiger salad since it looks good. Oh, if you need more rice just ask :). They also have sticky rice.   What I always give bonus for is the service. David is the one that served us and he is extremely hospitable and friendly. Chef Lisa also made sure to ask her guests how the food was so they are both very friendly. Always a plus to see owners actually caring about your experience. They interact very well with their guests.   Photos are posted for my order as well as the crispy fried tofu and the menu. ^^v"}
{"text":"Just moved to this area and I am hooked on Pan Asian. The owner is always super friendly, the resturant is clean, and when I call ahead and order to go it only takes abotu 10-15 minutes. Lunch specials start at $6.99 and include pad see ew, pad thai, and curry. You will pay a little more if you want shrimp as expected. I tried pad see ew for the first time here and I am in love with it. The flavors are so developed and every bite tasted better than the one before. When it comes to spice level beware. Their spice levels here are at least two levels higher than normal. I usually get a 7 at Pin Kaow but here I find myself getting 4-5."}
{"text":"Well, after two good experiences I had a terrible meal. Ordered pineapple rice and drunken noodle delivered. The pineapple rice tasted like it had a pound of MSG dumped on it, and an hour or two later I had a pretty bad reaction consistent with (a lot of) MSG being in the food. It just was awful. I don't know how a restaurant that does a good job with one dish (Singapore rice noodle) can be so terrible with another."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch with one of my gfs. I was really excited to try out this new hot spot with awesome reviews.  I was really bummed out with lunch yesterday and will not be coming back.  We ordered pad thai with chicken and singapore noodles with chicken. Both dishes were horrible. I'm a huge pad thai noodle fan and was not impressed at all. Both were lunch specials ranging around $7. On the other hand, my gf thought it was good.  Parking and seating wasn't a problem. Our server which could be the manager/owner was nice but then forced the issue of us coming back tomorrow... which I told him I live very far and he insisted I still come back. Ummm no thanks.  I wouldn't recommend coming here and I won't be back. Such a bummer, I was hoping to find a new lunch spot.  Sorry Pan Asian... Next!"}
{"text":"Pan-Asian food is Asian food prepared in a pan. Just kidding.  Ok, I am rarely accused of being original.  BUT, I was not familiar with the term.  Basiclaly, a well rounded menu.  I met this hot chick hitchhiking who had a coupon and so we had dinner together.  We tried the tiger shrimp salad with mango and Thai Linguinewith shrimp -mild-.  VERY DELISH.  The owner is very nice and I swear he needs to be a bit actor on Hawaii Five-O.  Finished up some fried ice cream and we were content.  Nice vibe to the place even though I would prefer an upgrade to the seating furniture.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Family owned. The Pho was delish.  But when they say something is spicy believe them. Awesome.  This is our new Friday lunch spot"}
{"text":"David Wong's has the best Thai food in Las Vegas hands down!  I had never tried Thai food until I started working near by and my co-workers raved about it. I tried the green curry one day for lunch and crave it all of the time now! I now go in about once a week.   The owner, David, is super friendly. The food is extremely fresh, the onion, peppers and green beans are so crisp! Everything I try is amazing!  My favorites are Chicken Green Curry, Drunken Noodles, and Red Nah. I recommend to everyone I see!"}
{"text":"OK, It has been a year nearly that I hace been coming here. It is likely one of my two or three favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, and is my favorite Thai restaurant, period. An update, it is busier now, and Lisa (the chef) still does the cooking herself, so it may take longer than before. It is well worth the wait. Some of my favorites: the Crying Tiger salad, the Shrimp Ravioli, the Pad Thai (it was pink!), the Pad Cha with fish  (sp? and not on the menu), the crispy duck, any duck, and, yes, the stir fried linguini with asparagus is a real favorite. They are friendly, the food is fantastic, it is made with love, care, and good ingredients, and the kitchen is open. In a world where I am concerned with what goes on in the kitchen of many restaurants, this place shines. Keep it up David and Lisa!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh with excellent taste. The service is prompt. Only the setting is casual in a shopping center."}
{"text":"We went the week it opened. The steak was done perfectly! Unfortunately they have no way of heating the sake which really docked my interest. I won't be returning until I hear better things about the drink menu, bartending skills, and warm saki."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had!  Better than the restaurants in Thaitown in LA.  It was so good, I wanted to go back the next day but being in Vegas, there's so many other places to try so we didn't go back.  Big mistake. All we could think about was how good this place is.  We had green curry with chicken, the drunken noodles, and chicken with black pepper stir fry.  They were all so darn good, I can't even rank them.  But the black pepper stir fry was the best.  Wish we lived closer..."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service.   When they say 1-10 on spicyness, be careful. Husband is Cuban and adventurous. He ordered a 3 (they warned him) and it was out of control. He couldn't finish his dish. The last time we returned we ordered 1 on everything.   This place is find, but there are better Asian places nearby."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews for this place, I thought I'd be more blown away.  Maybe I didn't order the right items but my food just felt like standard fare.  We got the pad see yew, the crispy spring rolls, the basil stir fry and the red curry.  Everything was well done (however I did find things a tad on the salty side).  Portion sizes were decent.  If this restaurant was closer to my house I can see coming here regularly, but otherwise I'm just as happy with the local asian / chinese / thai restaurants closer to my place."}
{"text":"We had the pineapple fried rice and beef pad see ew and both really good. Probably the best I've had. The only problem was the service. Our waitress was not very friendly and didn't help us out much. Hopefully next time we'll have a different waitress."}
{"text":"Great place, totally authentic. We like things hot, but Thai 7 was too much for us, so beware. The lady who took our order was very nice and recommended the garlic chicken without any heat and all I can say is thank you. We've got a new spot for Thai."}
{"text":"Wow, where to start... our server Jolene was absolutely amazing.  We came in with grumpy kids and she was accommodating with our every request. More than once we were feeling like those needy customers but she was a delight the whole time we were there.  We would return just because of her.  Then we got the food, which was ALMOST as excellent as Jolene's service.  And the price for the amount of food is a great bargain. We will be back, thank you all for the wonderful dining experience. Would give 6 stars if we could"}
{"text":"tiger shrimp mango salad and great lunch specials!  The service is always friendly and very fast. I go there for lunch during the weekday and it never disappoints. Everything I've tried on their lunch specials has always been really good. It is never busy in there, which is odd considering this place is REALLY good. It has a good mix of all Asian cuisine but I tend to stick to the Thai dishes."}
{"text":"This review is written with the caveat that I have had multiple prior positive experiences with Pan Asian before tonight. And it is more a service-based one rather than one centered on the quality of the food.  Tonight, I ordered the boat noodles. As any boat noodle lover knows, the crispy pork skin is essential to the experience. It adds a sharp, textured contrast to the richness of the meat and the broth.   I received my order to find the crispy pork skin missing. I inquired with the staff. Water, meet duck. They laughed it off stating that their supply was exhausted and they'd just give me \"a little bit more\" next time. What good does that do me, silly Pan? No explanation was given for why it wasn't brought to my attention when I initially placed my order.  For those who don't frequent Pan Asian, this was not a kitchen error left un-communicated to the front side of the restaurant. The cook is the owner and his wife interfaces between the front and the back, with another family member serving the tables.  Truly wouldn't have been an issue if they'd apologized right off the bat for a simple oversight. Instead, they dismissed it as a trivial matter and behaved as if they'd hoped I wouldn't notice the missing ingredient and ended up with their hands caught in the cookie jar. A disappointingly unprofessional experience all the way around.   Pan Asian, I will miss your boat noodles, but time will bring us closure and soon you will be a distant memory of a good thing that was, but no longer is. Mistakes have been made, but you will learn and grow. It's a shame, really, but I wish you well."}
{"text":"Ok so I went back a second time almost a year later and I have to say that it was MUCH better than my first visit. I don't know if they changed anything but it was fantastic! Food was great! Had the pineapple fried rice, gyoza, sweet and sour chicken and the special of pork ribs - presentation was perfect and the taste was fantastic. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend discovered this place near his office so I decided to check out the reviews on Yelp. I scored a yelp deal and got some $20 gift certificates for $10 each. The first time we went we ordered the Grilled Squid Salad, Malaysian Yellow Curry and Red Nah Noodles. All were good but the squid in the grilled squid salad was amazing! The second time we visited we order the Seafood Soup and the Crying Tiger Salad. The owner also suggested we try the Vietnamese Style Chicken Wings (which was not on the menu). Once again, the squid in the soup was excellent--very tender. Overall, I'd recommend this place to my friends if they want an alternative to Archi's, Pin Kaow or the like but within the same price range. I'd also recommend finding the Yelp deal that I did: $10 for $20 worth of food. Also, I'd like to mention that the Owners are very friendly and remembered us from a month ago when we first visited."}
{"text":"I came here due to the reviews on Yelp. It was good... not amazing. Ingredients tasted fresh. I would not go out of my way to dine here but it's a good option if you are in the area. I wish the potstickers were pan fried instead of deep fried but I did not inquire if that was an option, I just took them they way they come."}
{"text":"I had been here twice before and was not impressed. I ordered pad thai both times, my metric for all thai restaurants. If you cant make good pad thai how good can anything else be?  Theirs was mediocre nothing special. I wasn't planning on a return. But I read the rave reviews again and noticed no one talked about their pad thai. So i gave them another shot since they are close to home.   I had the pork ribs and beef garlic pepper. Quite amazing. Flavorful, complex sauces. Loved it. It was too hot (7), but thats my fault for not heeding other reviewers warnings. Good service."}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai Horrible! Pink dry chicken???took one taste and the rest went to my garbage can. Won't go back ever!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! It's small, cozy but modern and clean. They have some authentic menu items like the Beef Boat Noodles and Drunken Noodles (both of which are great!) and some fusion items like the deliciously fried Roti w/ curry dipping sauce...so yum!  They also have some specials like X.O. stir fry pork, which if you're Asian, you know that sounds amazing.   Be wary of spice level....spice level 5 is like spicy death....  Service is friendly and efficient.  Their Thai tea is milky and sweet, but I'd pass on that and pick more appetizers to taste."}
{"text":"Pan Asian is literally just down the street from where I am currently living at. It has been opened for only 2-3 weeks and without a splashy and eye catching sign, it may be easy to drive past on Durango unless you are really looking for it.  The restaurant has a large kitchen and prep area, but the dining area is comparatively small.  At the moment there are not too many tables and chairs setup (seating capacity is probably only at 16-20).  The interior is decorated simply but nicely.  The owner David Wong and his wife, the chef, are both super friendly.  After my first spontaneous visit after just having had dinner at another new restaurant that recently opened just down he street, mainly based on Misti Y's positive comments about this new restaurant.  So I was looking to see what their menu offers and try some desserts.  The Thai dessert looks interesting, but I was told that it was not available that day and to try the Cheesecake Tempura. It was regular slice of cheesecake that was cut into smaller pieces and tempura fried. It has a different texture and if you enjoyed fried desserts, this one is probably something you should try.  The next day I dropped by after a stop at the Costco Food Truck Fest #2, and tried the Massaman Chicken Curry.  It was tasty and the portion was generous. Before I left, the chef also gave me a large cup of longan tea (on the house)  that she brewed from dried longan that her relatives visiting from Thailand had brought her.  The flavor is sweet, as it was sweetened with brown sugar, and maybe that was why it also reminded me of the Winter Melon Tea that I used to drink when I was in Taiwan.  I really enjoyed the drink and the generous gesture.  Day 3, I had a Sababa Groupon to redeem before it expires. So after finishing the Sababa Special, which I thought would fill me up, I still had room for dessert and dropped in again to see if Thai Sticky Rice and Mango would be on the menu.  Lucky for me, the chef said if I was willing to wait a few minutes, she will make it from scratch for me.  It was a simple and very traditional Thai dessert served especially during the summer, when mango are in season.  And My T and his wife just happened to drop in for dinner.    With a friendly couple that runs the restaurant and serving good food at reasonable prices, Pan Asian is already starting to get a decent Yelp following.  I know I will be back soon to try more of the menu.  Decor:  4/5  Minimalist decorations that just works for the space.  Food:  5/5 I enjoyed the food I have ordered thus far.    Service:  5/5  The owner and his wife, Chef Lisa, are both super friendly. Can't have a meal prepared and served to you by a nicer couple.  Price/Value:  5/5  The price is fair and the portions are pretty generous. Lunch menu portion is the same as the dinner, so an even greater value.  Location is super close by, and even after I move a little further away, still worth the detour back from work or to satisfy a Pan Asian craving."}
{"text":"Great food. Good size portions. Service is awesome. Very friendly. Feels like I'm back in bankok."}
{"text":"After last night's fiasco at Lily's Thai-Vietnamese-Chinese restaurant, I had to think twice about trying another Thai-Vietnamese-Japanese fusion place so soon, BUT the $10 for $20 Yelp offer and the 4.5star rating after hundreds of reviews, I decided to give David Wong's Pan Asian a chance and I AM SO GLAD I DID! The food was SO DELICIOUS that we actually went back there the next night bringing the rest of the crew JUST so they can try the CRYING TIGER SALAD! Me & my family have now found a new fave place to eat! We ordered various items on the menu, and they were all good, food was freshly made and NO MSG! I am just going to give you a run down of MAI FAVES though, so here goes, definitely try the Roti, it comes with a  lightly sweet Malaysian yellow curry dipping sauce, the curries were really good too, we tried the massaman, & the panang, & the Pad See Ew was so flavorful , we tried the shrimp tiger salad with mangoes, that was delicious as well, but I have to say that the STAR of the dinner table was the Crying Tiger Salad, the steak was cooked just right, it melted in your mouth, you can tell it's char broiled, the dressing was phenomenal! I have to warn you though,they don't call it Crying Tiger for nothing, be careful when ordering your spice # coz the spiciness will make a tiger cry! I had # 3 and it was SPICY but good! My crazy husband dared to get # 4! Most of their menu items are spicy, so if you are not into spicy food your choices will be limited, but the owners and chef are VERY accommodating and will try to cater to your specific needs. Oh, and yes dessert, we definitely had room for dessert. We tried the fried ice cream as well as the fried cheesecake, I definitely like the fried cheese cake better, although we did clean both plates, Hungry much? We are definitely coming back to this place, it is pretty small, but I like to call it cozy, oh & YES they speak very fluent English! You can see the chef, who is David Wong's wife, lovingly preparing the meal you are about to chow down. You can clearly tell that she puts her heart & soul into her cooking, even though this is a small mom & pop restaurant all the dishes are presented like a work of art. They take pride in their product that is why they give it their best. So if you are having second thoughts, banish those fears from your brain, try this place out and you will discover a gem in the middle of Sahara."}
{"text":"Great menu selection, customizable plates, and excellent service. My parties food came out at the same time and the quality good."}
{"text":"MMMM...Our new favorite place. David and Lisa are so welcoming. Lisa does all the cooking. It's an open kitchen and my mouth waters just watching.  I love their curries. The panang and massaman have great flavor.  The stir fried linguini has asparagus, tomatoes, sweet pepper,garlic, chili and basil-need I say more?  My husband is a fan of the DW(david wong) fried rice and the Red Nah Noodles.(I am too)   If you like coconut shrimp you got to have theirs. As for a soup, I recommend the filet mignon \"PHO\".  While their pad thai is as good as any ones I've tasted, I much perfer to experiment and order other things on their menu.  Desserts, I hear they are good but I never have room.  Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"I've already returned and I have to report back all the seating upgrades they have added here. They have added quite a few booths and seating options and can now seat quite a few more people comfortably inside the restaurant, plus the booths are sparkly and red. Nice.  Service and the food were still the stars of the show here. I tried the Red Curry, Roti and Filet Mignon Pho on this occasion. They were all fantastic. The pho is more of a Thai version and has a great heat. The Red Curry was pretty awesome, but I think the Massaman is still my favorite. Looking forward to trying some of their rice and noodle dishes on the next visit."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. (and I rarely round up!) I am a HUGE fan of Pan Asian, and an even bigger fan of owner David Wong and his wife, Lisa, the chef! They are awesome people serving tasty, fresh food- hence the reason I round up.   My first encounter was during lunch with my toddler daughter. We started with the Chicken Gyoza- and I could barely get a bite because my daughter practically ate the entire plate herself.  I also ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu- and it was probably the best I have ever had. And I have eaten A LOT of Pad See Ew.    Came back for lunch yesterday, and as much as I wanted to order the Pad See Ew again, I thought I should try something new. I ordered the Massaman Curry that other yelpers have been raving about.  It was my first time trying this dish and I am sad that I hadn't tried it sooner.  The potatoes and carrots were perfect and the avocado, bell peppers, and peanuts gave it a nice texture.   My husband ordered the Thai style \"Pho\" and the broth was BURSTING with flavor.  I am a huge fan of Vietnamese Pho and have very high standards, but I have found a new love in this Thai version. Even after my husband added spice to it, it only enhanced the flavor and made it even better.  This is one dish that I can't stop thinking about.  I can't wait to go back and have a bowl all to myself.   My toddler daughter was being a tad bratty and wouldn't sit still to eat her meal, so David came to my rescue and bribed her with some ice cream (with my permission of course).  Well, she sat like a perfect angel and ate her lunch.  We also ordered the fried bananas, and like Paolo D., I prefer the Filipino version with jackfruit- but I must say that the coconut and sesame seeds in this dish was a nice surprise, and my daughter's vanilla ice cream was the perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"We came here after all of the amazing review I saw here on Yelp. I was here mid-Feb 2012.  We walked into the little strip mall, it looked like a dingy restaurant with old seating, but dont let the seating fool you this place is amazing.  It's run by a husband wife combo and boy do they know how to cook.  We ordered pad-thai and the Red curry.  Both were amazing.  I asked it to be extremely spicy because I love spice.  They didnt make it as spicy as I wanted it to be, but I dont care - it tasted amazing.  They make it to your taste if you ask them too.  It's like a home cooked meal basically.  The husband wife are from NY and are very entertaining and friendly as well.  We also finished off the meal with fried ice cream which was tasty.  Would move to vegas to eat here often. :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from this place, as it was close to my home. After searching through door dash and grub hub I decided to check the reviews on yelp of these places. This place had a nice rating score to reviews ratio. I decided to check the menu out and cross-reference any pics in the album. Everything looked pretty good and I kept seeing these noodles. So, I too ordered the chicken linguine noodles. The cashew veggie stir-fry with an extra side of rice. I was feeling really good so I also got a Thai tea. Everything was fresh and was actually really good. The Thai tea was a little extra sweet but that could just be me. The only thing they could improve on is the communication. I never got a confirmation alert. After about 45 mins I called to place to confirm and the lady said my order was out for delivery. Too bad for the drive not having change I wasn't able to tip. I would order again."}
{"text":"Today everything was so fresh! I got shrimp ravioli and papaya salat.  Will come back soon"}
