{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Sushi restaurants in Montreal! I've been to this place 3 times already and seriously though, I'm shocked with all these reviews! I've been to more than 10 sushi bars in this city, and they all had greater reviews than this one! When you're looking for QUALITY sushi and not COMMERCIAL one's,  why bother being picky about the decor? The variety of sushis in the menu were limited, but hey, as Gordon Ramsey would say \"quality over quantity\" ;) 
From my previous experience in most Montreal sushi bars, they mostly offer fried sushis so that the customers would leave stomach full without even savouring their dish. This really bothers me, since I keep getting full over nothing... when I ask them to not fry my sushis, they still do it and don't even indicate it in their menus if what I'm eating is going to be fried or not, which forces me to only eat nigiri sushis. But THIS place! Oooh no... the actually DO have non-fried Futomakis and hoisoimakis and EVEN if they do have fried stuffs in it, ( for example fried shrimp, which is totally acceptable since the dish mainly consists of tempura & btw kudos to this restaurant for not making it all mushy and insipid like most places) they actually INDICATE it in their menu! This place is awesome! I don't care if my restaurant looks fancy or stunning or whatever!  Wether I'm on a date or not, I'm here to enjoy quality food, not bland, tasteless sushi like we find in most of the Downtown area ( *cough* St-Catherine *cough*).

Je vous le conseil certes le restaurant ne peine pas de mine mais les proprietaires font des bons sushis sans etre exceptionnel mais bon ! Et pour finir le gros point positif est le rapport qualité prix tres bon ! Voila j espere que cela vous aura aidé et surtt bon appétit !"}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have ever had. It's not even mediocre it's just that bad. The tempura batter inside the futomakis were chunky and huge, taking up more than half of the sushi filling. If you think this is sushi you haven't had real sushi before. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"We had 2 sakea and a nigiri combo. Both excellent... Fair pricing also. The establishment is a little old, but who cares?"}
{"text":"C'est clairement pas l'endroit où amener une date. La salle n'est vraiment pas accueillante, la déco (pour le peu qu'il y a) n'est pas belle.
Le poisson est frais et bon. Les rouleaux sont ok mais pas assez très variés. Ce sont quand même des choix très classiques (rien de très original), mais peu avec du poisson (beaucoup de crevettes et goberge). Les sashimis étaient sans plus (on en a mangé des meilleurs)."}
{"text":"Cadre sale et triste.
Sushi tout simplement degueulasse!!!!
Serieusement , plus jamais , ca pour sur!"}
{"text":"If your craving late night \"fast food\" sushi- this is the place. You enter and there is a choice to sit in or take out. Ambience is very casual. Lots of seating areas but dark. Owner very quiet - which made the mood feel more somber.
Owner and wife hard at work to take orders for both sit in and take out patrons.
Large amount of food for the price. 
Menu was all in French - no English so we hoped for the best- looked up translations :). 
There was a lot of \"combo options\" . 
Note: there was a pre 3 pm menu (midi) and then there was a evening menu that was more expensive. Choices in combo were not that many.
However it came with Seaweed salad which was super fresh and very hot Miso Soup. 
I had the \"rainbow roll and sushi cone combo\"
Mine was full of rice and one huge piece(s) of avocado and a bunch of \"popcorn\" like shrimp. Interesting take on tempura style sushi. No Option truly for any sashimi.
Service did take a while but it was steady. 
Good enough for \"fast food\" option and late night cravings if u haven't eaten for hours and just want an alternative option to MCD. Not for sushi conosuiers.
It is the one casual dining  sushi place open we did find close to where we were staying."}
