{"text":"This is the best poke place I have gone to, and I've been to many. Their portions are very generous, their ingredients are fresh, and their sauces are very tasty. Their price is very fair alsoThis place beats Ahi Poki for sure! The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. I suggest coming here for a quick healthy lunch. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service with fresh tasty bowls with salad, and/ or rice, scoops of nicely prepared fish, shrimp, scallops, etc., tossed with sauces, and a variety of toppings. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and stumbled across the Aloha Poki Co.  Everything was fresh, was reasonably price, oh and delicious. Wish we had one at home."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving fresh fish today so we decided to give the new Poki place in our neighborhood a try. When we first walked in I noticed two things... how clean it was and the awesome surfing scenes on the television screens. It reminded me of getting poki bowls in Hawaii :) The two girls behind the counter greeted us right away and guided us through the ordering process- they seemed very knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered the Hawaiian ahi and the salmon over white rice. We chose the spicy creamy sauce and added fresh toppings such as masago, cucumber, scallions, and jalapenos. The service and food were great and we will be back soon to try a new combination."}
{"text":"Came here after work because it was the closest thing around and I fell in love with the food! Definitely recommend to any sushi lover, the staff was super friendly, and I'll definitely be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"My family and I go to Hawaii every year and I always look forward to eating poke bowls when I visit. Aloha Poki is the closest thing you'll get to an authentic bowl here on the mainland. Their Hawaiian Ahi tuna is marinated just right, and they have an extensive list of toppings you can try. I recommend the house spicy sauce, with seaweed salad, masago, and of course the tuna. Their tuna and salmon are of higher quality than many of the other poke places around. Looking forward to buying 9 bowls and getting my 10th one free ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome Poki restaurant!! The space is huge, lots of seating that's spread out, and always immaculate! Food is fresh, the rice is never soggy and the salad is never brown(my biggest issues with other poki stops in the area). Staff has always gone above and beyond to be helpful and make sure we got exactly what we wanted! Would recommend to all my family and friends!"}
{"text":"A new location. The food (raw fish poki) was fresh and delicious. Service was excellent, and the ambiance is nice. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed well kept and hygienic. They had friendly staff and the food was sold at a reasonable price. The bowls were aesthetically pleasing no matter what weird combination you came up with and were large enough in portion to fill you up. Overall, very nice and I hope it gets the love and attention it deserves."}
{"text":"Although it says they accept takeout orders, in reality if you prepay and order online for pickup, when you show up to the restaurant they will tell you that not only do they not have your order, but that they also don't even accept online orders.    Not sure why their yelp entry is linked to Eat24.com and how you can go thru the order process and pay without it going to the store, but that's what happens.   Thankfully Peter at Eat24.com quickly refunded my purchase."}
{"text":"After going back again, I've realized you get a lot of bang for your buck and everything tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"Brand new place for Poki in Ahwatukee. The place was fresh and clean. I had the salmon, spicy tuna, half & half rice/salad, and house sauce. Fish was fresh and house sauce was flavorful (although I still added wasabi and ginger). I'll be back."}
{"text":"We love poki and my favorite place is in CA but this place may be a new favorite at home.  The fish was fresh and everything was flavorful.    Things I would love to see... Bigger scoops of meat More spice in the spicey tuna Poke nacho option would be way cool!  The bowls look small but they are the right size for sure.  All toppings are fresh though keep in mind, the first scoop of seaweed salad or crab salad or fish roe is included...if you want a scoop of each you will need to pay for 2 additional scoops.   I ordered Hawaiian tuna, spicey tuna and octopus with pickled radish, cucumbers, soy beans, sprouts, avocado,  seaweed salad and green onions.  That cost me $13 and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"so..... the good.  Clean, open concept, cute place.  Everything looks clean and everything was filled up, ready to go in my bowl.  Typical price for a poke bowl.  so.... ok.  I got the spicy tuna (tasty) and the Hawaiian tuna (tasty but not the best, very grainy, lots of tendons).  Toppings, all were good.  All at a good temperature.  Being a poke/sushi/sashimi fan, super important.  so.... the bad.  The gal that helped me had something/somewhere else on her mind.  Could care less about helping me. (she has a 1/2 done tattoo on her left forearm).  So she put avocado down, then DUMPED edamame in the bowl, then COVERED the edamame with crab meat, then put (a whimpy pinch) seaweed salad right next to the crap meat, oh which is all next to the spicy tuna.  Boom! you have a crapmeat/seaweed salad/edamame/spicy tuna Goulash!  It's not that hard to put solids next to stringy items.  I'm not one to mix everything together so it was a turn off.  I shouldn't have to tell her that.  Plus she didn't care. THEN she didn't close the ponzu sauce so it ended up all over the bottom of the bag.  She needs to learn what she's doing.  I don't know, maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"We are here for lunch today. I had the Ahi Tuna and Scallops in my Poki Bowl and my wife had Avocado and Crab in hers. The meal was wonderful and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I've never tried a poki bowl before & it was fresh; healthy and delicious.  The staff was very patient and helpful too.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh and good healthy options. Love their ginger!!  They don't sell items on the side, only guacamole. I would love if I could buy extra portions of their ginger."}
{"text":"Clean and with an attentive staff, I only recently got into Poke Bowls, and this place has offered the best flavor I have encountered thus far. I especially like the Tin trays, a nice break from what feels like cafeteria trays elsewhere. It is obvious the owners take a lot of pride in their restaurants. I shall be returning with friends."}
{"text":"Ok food, I got the salad base with octopus, VERY chewy.  Place was empty, and for a Poki bowl with three scoops and two medium beverages, it was $18.50.  Yup, you read it right.  Our counter person came out when we opened the door and it \"beeped\" alerting her that a customer was her.  After making the poker bowl, she disappeared.  I needed more dressing so I went to the counter, loudly said excuse me to the kitchen door to no avail... my wife got up, opened the front door and set the chime off and wala..... the girl appeared, gave me more dressing and disappeared again.   If not for the occasional laughter coming from the kitchen. I'd assume this place was unoccupied. So, I'll be looking elsewhere when I get that late afternoon hunger pang again."}
{"text":"Not really great poke, you're better off going to Ahipoki Bowl down the street."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is my go-to for poki. The ingredients and rice are always fresh and very tasty.  It's basically set up like a Chipotle, where you start with your base: rice or salad, then you pick your proteins; tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, octopus, shrimp, after this you pick all the toppings which include but not limited to seaweed salad, masago, edamame, corn, cucumbers, etc."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here because of the reviews but it was close and I wanted something somewhat light.   It was clean, good AC going on, windows were a little tinted so it didn't get too hot inside and the furniture was modern and looked pretty new.  They have brown rice, basmati rice, arugula salad or half and half as the base. I got half brown rice half salad as the base.   The rest of my order was Hawaiin tuna, salmon, sprouts, avocado, cilantro, crab, ponzu sauce, wonton crackers, sesame seeds and dry seaweed crumbles on top. I ordered a regular but I thought it was pretty big.    The only thing I wouldn't get again was the tuna and maybe replace it with ahi tuna next time. Me and my boyfriend can be pretty picky when it comes to poki but we were both really happy with our bowls and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We really like this place. The food is very good, the staff is always friendly, we always get our food to go not because of poor atmosphere, it's just close to home and easier to get it to go. Pretty good value for the money. If I were in the neighborhood, I would absolutely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Made a pit stop after my massage next door. Nice clean place, friendly staff. I got the Hawaiian poke on a salad. Tons of topping choices. Mangos, avocado, corn, etc... Great healthy choice."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was helpful and attentive. Line went quick and they helped me figure out some good combos. Will go again."}
{"text":"It may be because I came so close to closing but my poke salad bowl was stuffed to the brim. So full that I actually had a really hard time eating it let alone mix it, but who's complaining! At one point while eating, I said to myself \"how could I possibly still have so much salmon left to eat?!\" Let's be real, not a bad problem to have. I've never been even remotely close to being \"full\" after eating a poke salad bowl, usually just satisfied. At Aloha Poki Company, I ordered the salmon salad bowl with the works (minus the crunches and wasabi) with the house sauce. Delicious. Even with the avocado, it was the cheapest poke bowl I've paid for in both Tucson and Phoenix. The ingredients were fresh and despite the fact that I came in 20 minutes before closing, they were still very accommodating and welcoming. I am thoroughly impressed and will certainly be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food was fine. No issues there. However, we were the only ones in there. Employee was almost non existent, we had to open the front door again to have them come out of hiding. She was nice enough whenever she came out. But the vibe was strange."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bowl at 1pm on a Saturday and store hours said open at 11am. However, the doors were locked and the open sign was not on. There was a lady in the lobby who saw me but didn't come over to clarify store hours. Waste of my time being that I drove from Maricopa to try this spot. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"My husband liked his, but I didn't care for mine. We ordered the same thing. Poke was mushy and didn't look fresh. I prefer Tokyo Joes."}
{"text":"This is the third poki restaurant I have tried and I loved it. My boyfriend and I both got a half and half salad. It was a little pricey but definitley worth it. The best part about it is that they had eel suace! Made my bowl a whole lot better. We will definitely be coming back. I hope they give out punch cards like other places do, that way people are motivated to come more often!"}
{"text":"Poke place is popping out everywhere in the Valley and I really like their ambiance here more so than others nearby.  They play soft Hawaiian music and their TV shows nice sceneries from Hawaii such as beaches and mountains. I enjoyed their music while watching waves go by on their TV screen.  They keep their restaurant very clean, including restrooms.   Food price is reasonable compared to others nearby, perhaps slightly lower for portion size.  Service was good. I would come back again if I am in the area,"}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here 1-2X per week, more when my husband is out of town on business. Super fresh and tasty, and the staff is AMAZING. I miss the punch cards, but am getting used to their new points system."}
{"text":"I'm surprised a $12 \"large\" bowl gets such skimpy portions. Most poke places give a healing portion of protein. The guy didn't even fill his scooper up. I haven't even eaten it yet and I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time customer and I must say It was absolutely delicious! Something light and fresh on a warm day. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 with spicy tuna and salmon. And loaded it with all their fresh toppings. Great value for the bowl I got. Staff was very friendly and the place is squeaky clean with great Hawaiian music playing. Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Apparently, their hours of operation are just a suggestion.  Came to get dinner Thursday at 6:30PM and they were closed.  I get closing 10min maybe 15min early, but 30?"}
{"text":"Oooooh yaaaaah this place always satisfies my poki cravings! And they do not skimp on the ingredients which makes it a winner in my book. I've only tried their Hawaiian tuna, salmon, and shrimp in the poki bowls and it's fresher than any other place I've tried in Arizona. Not to mention their cuts of fish are about the same size which makes a difference for me.  I usually prefer salmon over raw tuna but the Hawaiian tuna here is marinated in a perfect sauce that is far from fishy and delicious. This is the only place I've been to for poki that doesn't have fishy tasting tuna and whenever I bite into it, it's the right consistency and texture. I've never had a chewy spongey bite yet that I tend to get from other poki places nearby and hope I never do.   The building is very clean and has an open layout. Everything about this place is tidy and tables are spotless. It's very new so that's a given. As for service, I was served by a staff member named May and she's a doll! Very informative and sweet about everything! I will be going here for poki from now on."}
{"text":"My husband decided  I stay on the Ahwatukee side of the freeway and try this new spot. We were not disappointed. I had to stay at work so my husband ordered for me. He ordered half salad/ half rice with salmon and tuna. He added spicy house sauce and all the fixings. It was so yummy and they did not skimp in the serving size. It was more  then enough. We cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past from work, and was so happy to see the \"now open\" sign. Stopped in for Friday lunch. Ordering was quick & easy \"Chipotle\" style picking your bowl size and ingredients at the counter. Price is very good for a meal with sushi ingredients. Food was delicious! Fresh, a good variety of toppings, and good serving size. I got a regular size bowl which was satisfying without leaving me bursting or with extra to take home. Got us a loyalty stamp card, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Poke stops in the valley. The Poki Company varies itself from other Poke restaurants with its unique decor and variety of menu options. Portion sizes are generous, the spicy poke sauce is delicious! Be careful of the additional scoop for $2, although I would say it is definitely worth it. Stop by if you are in the area and have a poke craving!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and they explained everything.  I wasn't a fan of everything in a bowl since it's hard to mix I would have preferred a plate or a larger container.  Food was fresh everything was very clean"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much because it's convenient to my son's school if he wants a Poke bowl after school but it's so expensive compared to others nearby. They charge for sides when other places allow you to get them for free."}
{"text":"This new poke place has friendly staff and nice seating. The cost of the meal is 9.75 for a regular +1.75 for a large (3 scoops of fish). They have fewer options in terms of fish and sauces but plenty of toppings. The standard bases are available with salad, brown and white rice. The fish options include salmon, ahi tuna, shrimp and hawaiian tuna (maybe one more but it might still be tuna). I believe the sauce options include a house sauce, ponzu and spicy mayo. The toppings that I haven't seen at other places include fruit, corn and alfalfa sprouts. I do enjoy the taste of the house sauce but the bowl isn't too special. The portion is small compared to most places but larger than Ahipoki on ray so I would come here due to the proximity and slightly more food. I do appreciate the stamp card rewarding their loyal customers and it would be a great place for lunch if you work nearby."}
{"text":"Poki/sushi quick service concept. Tasty and flavorful within a clean atmosphere. I was completely satisfied with the quality and options on display. However, I think I would describe Aloha Poki Co. as about average as far as value. If they were to lower prices by about fifteen percent or provide drink combination options, I think that would be appropriate. I would certainly keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME...definitely hit the spot! The staff was helpful and friendly. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab a bite to eat. This place is nice and clean and the food is excellent. I ordered their spicy tuna and shrimp with spicy house sauce. The food was fresh and delicious not to mention the punch card they give is a nice perk."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting this place is near my apartment.. I always went to ahi poke on the other side of the i-10.. this place wasn't bad, just decent.. this place was nice and clean and the staff was friendly.. I can't really say anything bad about this place.. it was just average nothing really stuck out.."}
{"text":"First time visit turned into last time visit.  The portion given to you as \"2 Proteins items\" are so minuscule-it was as if the server was going to croak over and die if he gave you more than the size of your thumb.  My Son only wanted the 2 Protein items along with the rice-turned out to be the most expensive bowl of rice I've ever paid (nearly $10.00!) I went for the free stuff along with my 2 Protein items but still our bill came up to $27.00!  Sorry Aloha Poki but you get no Aloha from me again.  In Pidgin English: Me no come back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly stuff, very clean. Will be back!  Love that they have mango as a topping and fresh jalapenos.   Fish is very fresh."}
{"text":"This place is located near the UPS store and a bakery/cafe.   I really want to be able to say that this place was great, but it was missing a little something. They're a pretty new store, and there were a few final touches that still need to be made to the interior. The potential is there.   Food: The fish wasn't the absolute freshest, but it's decent. There were a ton of toppings, and they were generous with the portions. They don't have as many sauce options as other places, but they have the basics. I got a mix of the available sauces. There was a choice between a 3 differently seasoned tunas, salmon, shrimp, and I believe octopus. I got a regular size which comes with two scoops of protein. I got a scoop of the salmon and a scoop of the Hawaiian tuna on a bed of 1/2 salad and 1/2 brown rice. The tuna was good, but the salmon could have been better.   Service: They were really nice. You could tell that they were trying their hardest to make this place a success.  Ambiance: It's clean and has an open concept. There was no music playing, which would have been okay if there were more people, but for the longest time we were the only table occupied.   I think as more people hear about this place, it'll get better, but for now, I'll be trying the other poke places in the area.   I liked their fishtank. It reminded me of my childhood and being in one of those Chinese restaurants that have fishtanks all along the walls."}
{"text":"It was actually really good! I'll be back but I'll be asking for more if that creamy hot dressing!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD The food is great. Dining area is spacious and clean.   THE BAD AND THE UGLY  I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received here.   Whoever the manager is needs to train their staff appropriately and reprimand the OLDER FAT LADY WITH THE GLASSES who works there. I came in and bought two bowls of poki. As I walked over to get my drink and utensils, that lady who worked there blatantly yelled out that she couldn't believe I didn't tip. How utterly rude. To make matters worse, she complained about the next person who only put in his change.   Excuse me?! I didn't realize I had to tip someone standing behind a counter doing nothing. She did not acknowledge me, did not ring me up, did not prepare my order. Why would I need to tip her?  This is the reason why people do not want to raise the minimum wage. It is so that we don't have to continuously support 40 something year old women who can't do better with their life and get an education to support themselves. Instead,  they have to depend on $10 an hour and still can't be competent enough to do their jobs properly. It is customer service. Maybe provide customer service and then people will tip you. Maybe stop working in a job for teens and you can support yourself.   This establishment is new, but with such rude staff, no wonder it is not popular."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going since it opened up. Can't complain one bit, it's my favorite poki place compared to all the rest!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went last night because my Dad found a 50% off coupon in the newspaper and suggested we try it out... and today I am super sick with FOOD POISONING!!! That poki bowl was the last thing I ate. Do not go here... the fish is not fresh.   What I ordered: half brown rice half lettuce... 2 scoops of salmon, avo, corn, crab, green onions, wasabi and sesame seeds."}
{"text":"Oh man, so many thoughts, how to organize it into a review?  Let's just dive in because after this review, you may want to remain on land and stay the heck away from Aloha Poki Company.    Upon first glance, things looked decent.  It's a clean space, has an open layout, and there were a couple of tables with customers.  We got up, made our wild creations, and sat down to feast.  Everything seemed pretty vanilla at first:  A basic imitation crab salad mixture, some edamame beans here, wonton strips there, the tiniest cubes of mango placed accordingly, a sprinkling of corn, et cetera.  I got one scoop of salmon with their spicy creamy mixture and a scoop of their pre-marinated \"Hawaiian Tuna.\"  I do like how they added the sauce on top of my rice as well as mixing the salad in with the sauce.  But this is where things make a sharp turn for the worst.  The fish quality... yikes.  I know we're in a landlock desert known as Arizona but I haven't experienced fish quality so bad at other poke places or even at sushi places.  The salmon was okay at best, just a poor cut of fish.  The Hawaiian Tuna though was a nightmare.  I honestly don't know if the tuna was poor quality or the marinade broke down the fish but the tuna was bad.  The tuna ended up being gummy and stringy.  Their portions are pretty hefty but do you really want a big bowl of bad fish and lack luster toppings?  For two bowls [one large and one regular, both with the $1 avocado charge] and a drink, it was $27-something.  Take your money and go down the street to the place on 56th Street & Ray Road.  This place seems to be in the process of re-branding themselves as \"Aha Poki Company.\"  They also offer loyalty cards but even so, I don't think we'll be back.  Life's too short for bad poke!"}
{"text":"We went to it because it's on our side of freeway. It was great,clean place and fresh. The spicy house sauce had a great heat kick. The portion side looks small but they pack it full. We will go back the Hawaiian tuna and octopus was so fresh."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. Recently I stopped getting the Tuna. I think they switched it to a different kind but the quality has gone down because now it stinks. I typically get the half and half with salmon and octopus and the house spicy sauce. My favorite! Love that they pack on everything and service is typically pretty quick and helpful.   The dining space is clean and very organized. It is also spacious so you can bring a large group. Bathrooms are clean as well.   I also love their thai tea!"}
