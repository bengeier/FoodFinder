{"text":"Dear foodies,

As many of you may know, I do not normally give a restaurant or bar less than 3 stars. I must give this place 3 stars because their beer selection is very limited and boring. 

The lemon drop martini that I ordered was prepared pretty well, but did not blow my hair back like at some other places. 

Lastly, the food... Well, as a foodie that loves to cook and explore in the kitchen, I was underwhelmed by the tasteless dough that they use for their flatbread pizzas. I have made better pizza at home than this place. I have never had such lackluster pizza in my life; I ordered the vegetarian pizza, which they claim has garlic, spinach, onion, tomatoes, etc without the \"special topping.\" I requested that the \"special topping\" be placed on the side. The pizza came out and I asked the bartender, where is the garlic, she said that the garlic is only found in the \"special topping.\" The \"special topping\" consist of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. How tacky and unappealing. Where are the real pieces of garlic? Also the other veggies present were scarce and lacked in flavor as well.

I needed to wash down the nasty pizza and ordered a pumpkin pie vodka drink and that was yummy. But, no one could go wrong with this since it only consisted of pumpkin pie vodka, ice, and seltzer water.

The live jazz band made the experience tolerable but I will never good back. I was initially excited since I had never been here prior to that night.

Yikes!"}
{"text":"This place mayhbe permanently closed.  Went by on a saturday but was closed with a sign saying closed for an event,  but the place looked like it was not opening anytime soon. The bar tap handles were only bud and bud light.  2nd time trying to go here and they were closed."}
{"text":"This brewery is decent. The star rating indicates that. Yet again on our trip to Arizona we wanted to try a good brew pub after our visit to the ASU campus. We came across this place by Sun Devil Stadium and thought it looked fun. We then walked a few minutes after it opened and we were welcomed and took a seat. I decided to stray from my usual chicken tenders and got a brat instead. Luckily, we got a daily deal on that. There are TVs, they show the games. The best thing about this place by far is the view of the stadium. I have never been here on a game day but it would be really exciting before the game and hearing the roar of the crowd. Anyway, back to the food. I got my brat and I looked at it. It was very cold with no sauce. it still was good for what it was worth. The fries were good too. I was stunned to find they have no milk! What place wouldn't have milk?! Oh well. Still decent food with a view which is good. They did good overall, just make some minor changes and this place would be even cooler."}
{"text":"Amazing personal pizzas and friendly staff.  Lively regular bunch.  Great place to watch a game or take in ASU."}
{"text":"Mad Hatter has a good location: right by Sun Devil Stadium, right on a light rail stop. There's a nice patio. But, when you go here, you think of three or four small changes that would make this place great. The way it is today, it merits an \"okay\"  or under rating. The beer style is British, which is fine. However, if you want hops-bursting-out-of-the-glass beers, this is disappointing. The food is very generic (burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries, and the like), not particularly well executed, and priced about $2.50 too high. The staff is pretty good, but it's pretty hard to keep good bartenders and servers when business is so slow. There's just nothing that makes me recommend this place to friends.

EDIT: They no longer brew beer at this location. I walked by while the brew equipment was being removed. Pretty sad, I think having a little brewery was one of the owner's dreams."}
{"text":"The server we had was nice and he did check on us.  The food was not bad, it was just not special.  I gave only 2 stars because Mad Hatter needs a DEEP cleaning.  Dust and bugs on the window ledge inside was the worst to see while eating."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because my boyfriend and I heard about their all you can eat wings on Mondays. Their wings are HUGE compared to other places. You get 15 on first order, then they come in 5's after that. Ultimate sauce was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Additionally the waiter changed the tip and I had to call the credit card company to adjust his alleged fraud"}
{"text":"Why do they call this a brew pub if they don't brew their own beer?  Food was marginal. Grilled cheese was cold and didn't look like it was grilled and hardly any cheese.  The tomato soup as a side was cold.  My chicken sandwich was more bread than chicken.  They only had one amber beer left in a bottle, so we had to choose who was getting the beer. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Bartender was super rude.  Shock Top tasted off and everyone in my party of 10 agreed.  Took it back to her and she got pissed and literally threw the beers into a sink splashing it every where.  Literally no fucks given how she portrayed herself.  She literally ruined the experience for us.  Probably won't be going back and will tell all our friends not to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after classes one afternoon.  Service was EXTREMELY SLOW.  Ordered the nachos.  What came out was nothing more than food I could have EASILY made at home in under 5 minutes and using a microwave.  The combination of slow service, super low quality food and high price for what I received was not worth my time or money spent there.  I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I have been to Mad Hatter a few times. The first couple of times, it was only to order a beer off tap, so it is impossible to judge an experience off of that. However, I recently visited this establishment and ordered a few drinks and food, and the experience was so bad I was inclined to write this review (look at my account, I barely ever do this). The drink (an AMF) was the worst I had ever had, and I am used to $1 drinks at the Vine that taste like top shelf in comparison to this $6 concoction. The nachos were average at best, but the service was horrific. I was one of only a handful of patrons at the bar, and the server/bartender could have easily come to my table to take my order or to see if I was happy. Instead, I had to go to the bar to ask for things constantly. And when I asked for more lemons, he refused my request and made fun of me for wanting lemons. Way to treat a guest. I think it may have been the owner's son. He was white, tall and had brown hair. He looked like it was painful for him to be here, he probably only works there because his dad owns the joint and he can't find work anywhere else, which isn't surprising with that work ethic. Needless to say, I did not leave a tip, and I will never be coming back. What a shame, I live right by ASU. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place. The staff is always friendly. Not the largest selection of beers on tap, but the ones they do have are always good. The food is dependable. The outside bar has a great ambiance, and it's a great location for people watching  on a cool evening. Plus being off mill, it doesn't get overcrowded."}
{"text":"Mad Hatters..... I gave you a good review, I enjoy your little bar... however, we drove down to grab a couple of drinks on a Friday night at 9pm and you were closed?!?!? I know businesses and bars are all just trying to stay afloat, but I can't bring you business if you're closed at 9pm on nights when people actually want to drink and have fun... Now I don't know if it's worth it to ever make the trip down there, in fear of you guys not even being open when everywhere else is at that time.."}
{"text":"Went to the Mad Hatter in mid-January. Nice atmosphere, very nice staff, food was decent and good location.  The day we went was during the \"cold-snap\" that we had, so I was disappointed to sit down and have to go back out to my car to get my jacket because the staff had both doors propped wide open on a freezing cold day.  Strangely, they were out of most beers on tap. In fact, HALF of what they offered was not available.  Also, they were out of things on the menu as well.  If I were the owner, I would definitely look for a new (competent) manager.  

Three stars is for very friendly staff, decent food and good potential if they fix their management."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite pubs! Great for game day spot before an ASU game. The barters are super friendly and lots of locals go to this bar. 

Great local bar to go to if you are not in a rush."}
{"text":"Feels more like a local bar with a face lift than most of the ASU area bars so I really had a good time. The regulars are super friendly & fun, fun. So if you're looking for a chill place to hang, watch a game, chat up some friends this is your place. The staff are adorable & helpful to boot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place because of the poor quality of service. The staff members I encountered did not seem to want to be there.  When I asked for a menu, the bartender was rude, and had to wait 30+ minutes to order.  Not a problem if it was busy, but if its not I expect faster service.  I wouldn't really care to come back, 30+ minutes for an ordinary beer!  The price is not competitive, and neither is there service, so its better to head to Mill Avenue than hang around here."}
{"text":"OK, you guys have some work to do. I visited this spot when it was Dave's, twice. Once to try it out for the first time and 2nd because I was hoping it wouldnt be as bad as the first time. Wrong! I was really hoping that when it switched ownership, things would improve. Wrong again! 

The food: Simple bar food menu. Nothing special to make you want to come here. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger. It comes with fried onions on it, so I request no fried onions. They bring the burger out with no onions (thank you) but also, no BBQ sauce. Now, how am I supposed to enjoy my BBQ burger with no BBQ? The server was friendly but not very attentive. After I realized my burger didnt have BBQ sauce, I had to wait over 10 minutes for him to come back in our area, make eye contact and ask if we needed anything else. Fries are basic freezer to fryer shitty fries. Is it really that hard to slice a fresh potato and fry it?

The beer: Because, lets be honest, this is why we came. HORRIBLE. I enjoy a craft beer. Especially a local craft beer. Just because you buy a brew pub does not mean you are a brewer. You guys need to clean up your brewing or you're in trouble. We didnt even finish our first pint!!!! Literally the worst craft beer I've ever had.
Location: This is where the 1 star comes from. This is a great location with a pretty sick patio. However, I dont think its enough to save these guys.....

I dont see going back to this spot until it changes ownership again which inevitably, it will."}
{"text":"Good menu. So many tasty classic choices. Had the buffalo chicken sandwich while my lady had the burger. Small but on point beer menu. Service was excellent. It was super hot but that is not this establishments fault. I'm pretty sure Jesus made it hot. (Not the name of the waiter)"}
{"text":"Didn't even end up going to the place, called twice to ask a question and was hung up on twice. The second phone call the guy on the other end called me a mother fucker and hung up on me. Will never go here and highly suggest others do the same since they clearly don't know about customer service. Never been treated that way in my entire life. Disgusted."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon and have never been able to use it as this place does not appear to still be open. Most recently, I tried on a Saturday night at 7:00 PM-Closed!  I have tried to call and verify their hours and reach a message with \"Mailbox Full.\"  Also appears that they last updated their website over a year ago so no help there. 

Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"My son and I drove 10 miles to try it out (I had a Groupon I bought just a couple of days ago) and they were closed at lunchtime. Tried calling. Got \"full mailbox.\" What gives?

By the way, The street is heavily under construction. Where are you supposed to park?"}
{"text":"Another quick beer to check things out, but the 4 stars is for CORN HOLE. Yes, a cornhole game in Tempe. Loved this game which I first discovered in the Midwest before it became popular everywhere. This bar is like a long skinny place, still it fits in live music, a large patio, cornhole and a nice bar where you can sit half inside and half outside. Of course, it is the closest bar to the sports facilities, so post or pre game, this is a good place to get things going drinking wise. Huge props for the cornhole! Bud lights are $4 in this place and all specials require a college ID."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was prefect to watch football lots of TVs has a great indoor/outdoor space. We had a flatbread pizza which was good as well. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both are ASU grads, and after years of walking past this corner pulled the trigger and went in for a Friday lunch. 

Typical neighborhood bar atmosphere with an open garage window making it warm (can't ding too much for this, as it is AZ). They also do Geeks Who Drink trivia, which we've participated in at other bars several times. Huge incentive to come back. 

Great deals for Monday wings and Thursday Night Football. 

The food exceeded expectations. Shared a French dip with tater tots and mac n cheese with bacon, chicken and a side of fries (as the bartenders suggestion). Service was great and the bartender had a great attitude. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that any restaurant could ruin something like fries and a Diet Coke... but then we came to Mad Hatter's for trivia night. I don't normally write bad reviews and I hate doing this kind of thing, but this place really stood out as really poorly run. The fries were soggy, saltless, and had to be dunked in ketchup to be made edible. The Diet Cokes were flat - and worse, when I complained the manager said it was a common problem and that the waiter must have gotten it from the back. If it's a problem that you know about, tell them to not get it from the back or fix the machine - there's no reason to serve your customers flat sodas. They also didn't seem to have half of the stuff written on the menus available, and the food our friends ordered seemed so bad we didn't feel tempted to order anything else. Then they never brought our check, we had to go to the bar to pay. 
There's a general feeling of malaise there - none of the servers seemed to care at all. They didn't bring napkins or silverware, check on us, and didn't greet us and instead barked at us to see our ids (we're over 30) when we first sat down. There was one person who seemed to be the owner who was trying to make it better, but he seemed way over his head. I'd give this place a wide berth and pursue your trivia another night elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this place's food, but specifically the bartender. I went on a Sunday morning with a group of four to sit at the bar and nurse a hangover. They had a decently priced menu geared towards lunch and bar food. 

I ordered a cheese flatbread. I wish I could say I liked it but it tasted like cafeteria food. It was completely over-seasoned, under cooked, and salty. Although the pizza wasn't good, I got a taste and have to say their wing sauce is awesome! As is their ranch. 

When I went to pay my tab the bartender asked if I liked the pizza and I was honest and said no (I had only had a few bites). He apologized and took it off the tab. I was blown away with how nice he was! That never happens. I'm someone who would pay for something that I partially ate no matter if I liked it or not. 

I wish I could remember your name, Sunday Morning bartender on 3/19 :D You're the best! I'll definitely be back some time for a drink."}
{"text":"If you are near the stadium and need a drink and some people watching, Mad Hatter (formally Dave's Electric) is a decent option (and frankly there aren't a whole lot of choices in this area unless you want to make the trek to Mill) The beers on tap have changed, the menu is basically the same with a few simple changes. Happy hour is $1 off drafts, wells and $2 off appetizers (hummus plate, nachos, quesadilla etc). The bar tenders are always cool, easy to talk to and knowledgable about the beer, couple that with the great view of the side walk off College and Veteran's Way and you have a cool spot to chill after a long day/week/hour/meeting.....you get the idea."}
{"text":"Friday night trivia was a lot of fun. Came in with a huge party.  Our waitress was on it! Food was your regular bar food, nothing special. A decent menu of beers on tap. I would have gave it 4 stars if it weren't for the spider webs everywhere. Not something I prefer to have all around me, clean that up folks!"}
{"text":"Fun place for a quick bite to eat or a beer with a friend. Has a homey feel to it. Staff could be just a little friendlier but it's not to the point of being rude so I write it off."}
{"text":"Its totters between Meh - I've experienced better to A - OK.  
During game day for football its pretty fun.  Always a good place to have that last drink before heading to the stadium.  But for pregaming before basketball... well it was kinda dull.

I never had food here, and I have no desire to even try the food here.  The brews can be improved upon.  I know its a brew pub, but I recommend getting a well drink or something.  

Like I said, good place for that last drink before heading into a game.  Sadly, not for much else."}
{"text":"Always a great place to relax after work and be for any sporting events! Great service, great queso and ALL THE TOTS!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is prepared from scratch and full of flavor. Local beers on tap forced us to try something new and we couldn't complain. Located next to ASU but not loud, crazy customers were there. We would definitely come back if we ever come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Mad Hatter Brew Pub is a fantastic place to enjoy the Tempe/ASU area. They have really great beer and a nice patio in the right season. The only reason I give 4/5 stars is because the location is a bit small and parking can be hard but I am in the minority as most Patrons probably walk or light rail around. If you have not had the opportunity I highly suggest Mad Hatter for a pint."}
{"text":"It was Game Day ASU vs Washington so the entire area was busy.

So many new options have opened in this area, however I kept my vow to just follow along. Although rare, I wasn't the leader on this day. I was a little heart sunk when our group walked right past Postinos, and a touch relieved as we strolled by Dickies BBQ, and then there it was... The Mad Hatter, I had been there before and it was always empty. Today the place was very busy with a patio extension and extra security. As we made our way through the place we ended up at a  great table on the original patio, smack dab on the corner of College and Veterans Way. The table was perfect, and the company was stellar and that's as good as it got.

Our server was obviously not a regular staff member, he seemed like someone's buddy that just worked on game days. Initial beer orders taken and tiny paper game day menus dropped. The menu was small, with just a few items, a burger, chicken strips, French dip and chili cheese fries. I guess when your expected volume soars from regular days you have to do what it takes to keep the quality coming out of the kitchen. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. everything from the kitchen was barley passable to awful. 

French dips were bland with no flavor at all and the au jus was served in 1 ounce Jello shot cups, certainly not dippable, and the fries with mine were Ice cold. The Chili Cheese Fries were even worse because they looked disgusting and tasted like curry and were smothered in gloppy flavorless cheese. My friend said she was going to eat her burger but it wasn't very good, and the chicken strips weren't finished by a big 17 year old boy. 

All this served with no salt and pepper, no napkins or utensils and OLD broken, almost empty ketchup bottles.

I know this place is almost always slow, It really needs customers and I think instead of turning off 300 people on game days they should try and wow 300 people on game days. Location for us was great and it was a nice gathering of old friends, at least we had that."}
{"text":"So, this used to be Dave's Electric Brewpub. It was OK at that time. Now that it has changed hands...again, so many times...

Whatever, taken on its own merits, this place sucks. Plastic cups, plastic utensils...but not a discount price. $6 for a crappy breakfast burrito. I have had better burritos from a frozen wrapper. They were out of most of the drinks, champagne for mimosas, most of the beers. I see the end looming.

I wonder what crappy place is going to be here next."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night (and the fact that we are married probably indirectly implies that we were  the oldest people there) but I was instantly enamored because they were playing Greenday, circa 1994. While probably no one else there knew that Billie Joe used to have a nose ring, purple hair, no eye liner and look oh so cute, I will forever have great appreciation and affection for Basket Case. 

Anyway, we were drawn to this restaurant by Groupon and the beer selection.  The outdoor seating was a plus because nothing beats a cocktail, except for a cocktail on a patio.  This restaurant is blocks away from the main drag though, so I think in normal conditions, people watching would be sub-par.  

However, last night was not normal conditions -- it was coincidentally also the night of the underwear run, which, from what I could gather, is a run (race?) exclusively of college students, wearing nothing but underwear.  We saw a collection of interesting underwear pass our table...and while some may find a butt cheek to be unappetizing during dinner, I found it amusing - paired with the trivia questions offered on a 5-10 minute interval from the bar staff, dinner was nothing short of entertaining. 

And while the menu was typical of what you would expect from a bar, I think the food was tasty and well priced.  I had chicken and my husband had a burger. The french fries were widely cut and as he described, \"perfect, and spiced somehow.\"   We also had chips and salsa.  The salsa was spicy and the chips were extra salty (I love salt).

I give this place 5 stars for music and 3 stars for food and drink. I like the large patio and both inside and outside seating at the bar...but I think without the underwear run, it may have been a little boring on the people watching scale."}
{"text":"Mad Hatter is a lot of fun on the weekend and on game days. Expect fun bar food, decently priced drinks, and a great atmosphere when you are there. 'Hatter' is a local watering hole for local university goers and has a great community of people who like to have fun and hang out when they are there. You can also participate in trivia when they are competing."}
{"text":"I don't now if I can write a fair review since my significant other and I stopped by at two pm in the middle of summer and were literally the only people there BUT we had a nice time. Cheap beer, some cool drink selections, and the bar guy was nice. We got a flatbread which was pretty good too. It's not five star pizza but it hit the spot and it was a good price. If we move to Tempe this would be somewhere we'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Great music,  nice bartenders,  friendly regulars,  and cheap beers.  Right next to the light rail.  Love it."}
{"text":"Small but clean bar with decent beer selection (bottle & draft), including local beers. Can't beat the location because it's across the street from ASU stadium, but trying to get a drink here when there's a big game is close to impossible. Also, no parking. Park close by (metered or lot) and walk. Close to light rail, so take that if it's an option!"}
{"text":"My chicken strip appetizer came with 3 chicken strips and my pretzel appetizer came with 4 skinny and small bread sticks. Ordered a regular margarita on the rocks and it was 98% margarita mix. But my bill was still 28$. We will not be returning to this place. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"This place really isn't bad, but it's not particularly good either. Personally, I never see too many people in here, and with all of the great food options around I can kind of understand why. 

When I was here, I had a burger that was a lot to eat but that couldn't really convince me to finish it. It was sorely lacking some flavor despite the myriad toppings they put on it. Our server was nice, and the food was really cheap for happy hour, but I probably won't be coming back here. 

I'd assume this place would be good to watch games, but as someone who pursues good food and atmosphere above all else this place just fell short."}
{"text":"This is your average pub. Nothing special, but not bad either, especially for the price. I know they do a happy hour where they have food and drinks for ridiculously cheap which is great."}
{"text":"Came here on game day last Saturday from out of town visiting for Family Week... the place was a bit crowded, but not too crazy yet. We went inside and unfortunately our bartender was really rude. Just no \"hi\" \"hello\", just that upwards head nod of \"what can i get you\" which is fine and all but like I said, it was a bit crowded, so I couldn't see the beers on tap. I asked for a Corona, he said he didn't have that - okay, no problem. My dad politely asked \"do you have any mexican beer?\" and he responded, \"all i have.\" and pointed to the beer taps, again, that we couldn't see (I'm a whopping 5 ft 3.25 inches). So I had to look around to see if they had beers listed on a board or something, to which he visibly got annoyed. Eventually we both ordered two blue moons... second star was for the tasty and quick wings we ordered. Lacking in the friendly / customer service dept."}
{"text":"I liked this place better when it was Electric Dave's.  Menu is basically the same with a few changes and deletions.  It is really pricey, though. Went there yesterday and got a veggie burger and an iced tea (it was lunch) and it was $13 and some change.  So,with tip, $16 for lunch.  Sorry Mad Hatters, I can pay a bit more and eat at House Of Tricks and get a gourmet meal.  Maybe that is why I was one of two people in there at the time.  I gave two stars because the bartender/waiter was attentive and the burger was good (not great)."}
{"text":"Had a Amazon Local deal for this place which is close to my office.........so we thought we would try.  All the Sodas were flat.........food was disgusting..........my wife's salmon had 7-10 bones still in it.  I would never bother to go back and I would think this dump will close soon anyway...........oh and the bathroom had an overwhelming odor of sewage.
Avoid"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't give out 1 stars but this was one that is necessary.   My fiance and I went here because we were craving a wrap.   We each got a different chicken one.   There were stringy chewy pieces in almost every bite...  The wraps were so dry we got sides of ranch and it still didn't help.   Just bad all around.   The only star on this can go  to the tator tots since they were alright,  just tasted like any u buy out of the store tho.  Pretty sad we even spent money on this place"}
{"text":"Love this place. The drinks are strong and the food is yummy. The Mac and Cheese will chase your life. Watch for the regulars - they an be handsy but harmless!"}
{"text":"I like Mad Hatter.
It's close enough to campus for me to walk over for a pint in between classes.  
The food is consistent.  Not earth shattering, but good.
They have a good selection of beer.  And it seems as though they rotate them out from time to time. Which is nice, variety is the spice of life you know.
The bartenders have always been friendly, as well as the other patrons.  
Very laid back. Which I like."}
{"text":"The place only rates one star but gave them a second star just because they have some other beers available besides their own terrible ones that don't taste like toefungus. Food was average at best. as was the service.  One would have hoped a repackeaged Electric Dave's would improve itself but alas it hasn't.  Plenty of other options on Mill Ave or Four Peaks that are so much better.  Just a matter of time before this place closes it doors."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant by the Devils stadium is my neighborhood go-to place. Whether it is a crazy, raging ASU game day or a quiet night of grabbing a beer and some food while watching hockey on a Tuesday, I always feel taken care of. I love that when the bartenders see my boyfriend and I walking up, our drinks are already made and they come around the bar to hug it out. 

Not only is this a chill place to hang out, the food is really good too. Mmm I love the Mac n cheese, the burgers, flat breads and chipotle chicken salad. The cooks and owner are always experimenting with new ideas in the kitchen and are really creative. If you can get there before they're sold out, get your hands on some Schreiner's brats and awesome fries for $8. They are always gone by Saturday night though 
:( The struggle is real. 

All in all, this is a great place to feel at home with your friends and a staff that will quickly become your friends. They have great craft beers on tap, food, trivia on Fridays, tons of tvs and even live music!"}
{"text":"Little bar near ASU Sun Devil Stadium.  The place is probably fun during game days but I have never seen it busy at night...  The beer I tried was good, but didnt make up for the [lack of] atmosphere."}
{"text":"I come here often and have never had a bad experience... The bar tenders are great, they are friendly and always provide quick/ attentive service! This used to be my favorite spot to grab lunch between classes at ASU ( $10 for a Shock Top and any menu item at lunch), but now has become a date night ritual on Monday nights with my husband! We love it here and if we don't make it once a week we start to have withdrawal symptoms lol!"}
{"text":"This place has great specials and happy hour. The staff is attentive and gives customer service. Anything you choose from the pizza to salads you can't go wrong. The drinks are mixed well and they give you better specials better than Mill Ave. if you are trying to find a place that you get your money's worth than this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"This place should not exist.  Its takes more than just one bad experience for me to give a 1 star out.  In short, my colleague and I felt extremely unwelcome.  It was to the point where there were 4 guys at the bar (who were obvious friends of the disgusting bartender) who were telling us to \"go to a real bar where they have real drinks.\"  They were full on harassing us for zero reason in the middle of a day on a Thursday.  Wtf?  

Other great things about this place...
-They were out of almost every beer we ordered (and ASU was back in session in a week)
-Bartender really didn't even know what an IPA was 
-The kitchen/back area can be seen while you are sitting at one of the tables and if it passed health code, I'd be shocked. 
-Bathroom was horrendous AND out of toliet paper.  

PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE so it can close and something great can take that ideal corner in Tempe."}
