{"text":"Super solid. Arrived at 10ish on a Saturday night, had a cozy bench-table in ~15min, food was tasty, cheap biru, everything was clean. Ranks among Don Don & Guu for sure!"}
{"text":"I understand the need to cater to North American customers, but the yakitori here tastes too \"clean\". Nowhere near smoky enough, not enough fat in chicken, definitely not enough sauce. It needs more of burnt chicken/pork fat goodness with much more charcoal smokiness. My question to the people working here is, would you eat your yakitori if you were in Japan? Wouldn't you think it tastes too bland? This isn't sushi fish that's difficult to import, we're talking about chicken, pork and beef. There is grilling culture here in the N. America, people will definitely notice the taste difference if you can make it right! Please don't be satisfied with offering \"good enough for Canada\" food to us Torontonians.

Also, this place is a bit inconsistent with drink mix and food temperature. I ordered same non alcoholic drink at different times, but second time was much less sweet. Some of yakitori came hot, but others were lukewarm.
Also, I did not like the salad here. I had seafood salad. Nice presentation on odd plate, did not taste great.
Overall, \"style over substance\" was my impression here.
I agree that the mega pint is a plus.

With new kintori opening, let's see who does it better."}
{"text":"Have gone to this restaurant about 5 times already, probably my favourite of all izakayas in Toronto. Atmosphere is a traditional izakaya (Japanese pub/bar) like you find in Tokyo, Japan - loud and casual and tough to have a conversation other than with the person next to you. Food is always delicious, especially all the meat skewers which they cook over a charcoal grill. I would say all their menu items are great, but their sashimi is just ok. Prices are good compared to other izakayas in the city. Service can be hit or miss and often you need to waive down your server to get their attention. You get two hours max for dinner which they immediately tell you when you make a reservation and when they seat you - this is irritating and tacky and probably the only reason why I don't rate this restaurant perfect. Despite this, will be returning for the food and value."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was very good. They greet everyone coming in and going out. I liked the experience. You must have a drink while eating here. Food comes out one at a time, so there is a lot of waiting. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was because they didn't put in a one order out of 10 (mushrooms). No big deal, we were full by then. Recommend this place"}
{"text":"First time here and I love it! Will come here again once in a while because it is pricey but worth it. 

There is a big variety of skewers! My fav was the grilled pork, unagi, and beef tongue.
I absolutely love the rice dishes, def will ordwe it everytime. We got the chicken with raw egg and rice.

The wagyu is good but I'm bot sure if it's worth the price. Super soft and juicy though. 

Dessert was ok, not fantastic but not bad. Nice to try it and a good ending to a fantastic meal.
Had the sapporo special, a pitcher for 13$ what a steal!"}
{"text":"Each time I have a Zakkushi reservation coming up, I think of nothing else for the rest of the week.

The yakitori is delicious. The yelling is fun. The Sapporo Beer Blasts are great. The black sesame ice cream is truly amazeballs.

The only time there was ever any confusion (i.e. an order that didn't arrive) involved a confused-looking waitress, but she seemed to be a trainee. Best to clarify if your order goes rogue for an extended period of time.

But everyone there (including the dreaded Clipboard Time Management Guy, who oversees the 2-hour time limit) is really friendly and accomodating.

Zukkushi is the bomb."}
{"text":"Having been to Japan in the past, the food and ambience at Zakkushi is as authentic that you will get in Toronto. They actually serve oden, which most Japanese restaurants in North America do not have. Many of the actual Japanese patrons order this too, (it is a variety of tofu and veggies in a very rich broth, highly recommended in winter). Owners, please don't reduce the variety of oden ! 

We have been to Zakkushi over a dozen times, and enjoyed every time. Book in advance, this place gets filled up quick. Servers are great, when we went for Halloween they were all dressed up too. Been to the other izakaya type restaurants nearby (looking at you, Guu) and the food was nowhere near as good, with sauce that was just amateurish. Would definitely recommend eating here !"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Chicken heart, premium beef tongue and intestine were the best!!"}
{"text":"We found this place randomly while searching for late night Japanese food and we were super impressed! We walked in here on a Wednesday night around 11 pm and the place was packed. Loved the atmosphere! The interior reminded me of Izakaya restaurants in Japan. The service was great - they were very friendly. There was a little too much on the menu which made it hard to choose what to order. I recommend the Waygu beef, giant scallop with soy sauce & butter (a little bit too salty but still good), seafood salad (big portion and very tasty - has wasabi dressing), takoyaki (very fresh), Mentai Carbonara udon and Kitsune udon. I will definitely come back here to try the other dishes! Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The premium skewer was yummy! Their oden was great as well, very clean tasting. 
Their dessert was sub-par, I wouldn't recommend it

They also tried to squeeze us into the corner of our table to make room for people. I could understand if there were a lot of people waiting but there were only five. If that had gone through, I probably would have left shortly. But we obviously didn't fit on the one table with the amounts of food we had ordered. 

If you get a chance, go check out the restroom as well. It has mouthwash, floss and other goodies."}
{"text":"With a plethora of delicious things skewered and cooked over coal, Zakkushi's off to a great start. The space is all dark wood and emanates warmth. I especially liked the seats/stools that also served as a place to stash one's personal items. Staff was friendly and enthusiastic.

Of the things I tried, I enjoyed the following best:

- Chicken hearts - really nicely cooked and tender. I preferred the teriyaki sauced version over the salt. Both, however, are more than acceptable.

- Chicken knees - really good, but very salty. Loved the light breading and the crunch of cartilage. Would definitely order this again.

-  Mochi ice cream - the maple syrup lent it a really lovely autumnal flavour.

Everything had a light charcoal kiss and fried items were well prepared.  Overall, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place with fantastic food. Love, love, love it. Not only the grilled or deep fried dishes are delicious, their desserts are also adorable. If anything the downside was the wait. Making reservation ahead of time is highly recommended. Guess this place is well loved by many people :)"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We've been here so many times that the waitresses call us by our names now. Yakitori is authentic, but the kid's favorite is the age mochi (fried rice cakes). Better to make reservations on weekends."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Been to a few well known izakayas in Japan and I can honestly say there was no drop off in quality at Zakkushi. Big fan of the cheese-mochi-pork skewers, wagyu beef and pork skewers, but everything on the menu is pretty delicious. Great place to eat, drink and just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This is a yakitori place.  There are a lot of kind of yakitori taste like a real Japanese.
they open until late. I will come back!"}
{"text":"I did not order many items, but I enjoyed everything including their food, services, and atmosphere. Some items are priced cheaper than I expected. I happened to like many from cheaper side, so that was great too. Both the food and pricing seem better than they are at some other Japanese restaurants around here. 

I kept seeing reviews of the karaage on yelp, so I ordered one tonight. It was good :) I would say the flavor is more on the home made side. The hohji-tea pudding was amazing. Maybe it's easier to explain that this dessert tastes similar to chai tea. There are so many more things I wanted to try, so next time!

I liked the background music too. I wanted to give 4.5 stars because they do not have fried rice. But 5 starts instead of 4, because this restaurant did not disappoint me at all. It was not noisy like a place you would lose hearing when you leave, like dinner time at Kinka. This was a huge relief. Lol

The servers here are all great and I even want to go back there to see the staffs again. The services are better than that of any other JP restaurants in this area :)

Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Been to this place several time. I can literately taste the difference every time: they are trying, and getting better. 

After tried at least half of their menu, my must-haves are..........
Skewers: uzura maki,  wagyu beef, oropon beef, norimayo tsukune, (cheese) mochi maki, scollop.
Appetizer: beef tataki, shime saba. (Actually these two items are not so special comparing to other places, but I like this two dishes so much so I order them whenever I see them lol.)
Main: Their special cold udon was just awesome. Not only meets the eye, taste was good as well.
           Oden, it's one of my favourite food, both Korean and Japanese style. Therefore although Zakkushi's oden was only normal, I still order them everytime:p"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! From the crew, to the place itself, and of course, their food! I really don't have anything negative or mediocre thing to say about our visit there. Granted, we waited a little bit, but the fault's on us because we didn't think to call in and make a reservation first. Considering how busy the place was even on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"love their items variety. services are excellent and food are freshly grilled/made.  Chicken skin is my all time favourite but qaulity of it is not always stable, they over grill it sometimes. But food overall are in good quality, pricing is reasonable.  Fish liver is a must try item if you can handle the fishy taste."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try yakitori in Toronto for a while and Zakkushi did not disappoint. Went with a bunch of friends from work and everyone enjoyed immensely. We mostly had the yakitori starting with the Zakkushi Set and Premium Set as well as individual orders of chicken gizzard, chicken skin, crunchy pork, garlic stubs wrapped with pork, beef tongue and beef meatballs. Also had monkfish liver and baby squid as sides. Ice cold Sapporo just elevated everything to the max."}
{"text":"Zakkushi is another great place to go for Izakaya featuring Japanese style skewers. This place is usually very busy with the skewer house on the ground level and sushi bar located at the underground level. It's better if you make a reservation beforehand. We ordered a premium set, a zakkushi set, assorted sashimi, monkfish liver, and some other random skewers. All the skewers we ordered were very yummy. It's worth to mention the monkfish liver. It was noted as Japanese styled foie gras on the menu. It's very delicious!!! Should definitely order it if you like foie gras. 

They also carry a great list of sake. We tried out two bottle of different kinds but don't remember their names. :P Also they are having a promotion on beer. $9.99 for a pitcher of Sapporo from Sunday to Thursday during May to August. Very good deal.

This place is little bit pricy because the portion of each skewer is very small. And if you are hungry, you will end up order a lot like we did. LoL it's very easy to go over $100 for a dinner of two."}
{"text":"My favourite items:
-wagyu beef
-premium beef tongue
-p toro (pork)
-cheese mochi maki
-karaage 
-onigiri 


Service:
The service is a hit/miss. Sometimes they are very friendly. However, most of the time I feel very rushed to get out of the restaurant.

I understand that it is always packed, so they want customers to leave fast etc...

But I don't like eating and having servers come tell me that we must give our \"last call\" kitchen order. This is not the usual \"last call\" due to the kitchen closing. When they ask you for any last-call ordering , it means they will start printing your receipt in the event you are no longer ordering. Then they can quickly bring you your receipt once you ask for the bill and it will speed up the process of customers leaving."}
{"text":"One of the best izakaya n Toronto. Give a thumb to the atmosphere and the service. Food are also above average. Takowasabi is the must try dish."}
{"text":"3/5! This place is good - especially for the price point - but I still prefer guu. We started with the Kobe meatballs and maybe that was our mistake as we should have ordered the skewers. We also got the chicken thighs which were average. Our favourite dishes were the broccoli tempura and grilled garlic shrimp. We should have done more research online and ordered the recommended dishes - but based on our first experience I've definitely been to better izakaya type restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Compared to a year+ ago, the portion size of the skewers have decreased by 50% while the price remains the same if not more. I umderstand the currency, rising food costs etc. But we were very disappointed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is the business, bbq beef, eel, you name it they own it. Staff is cool, don't know what they're saying but sounds like they are having a good time."}
{"text":"have been there so many times. One of the best Japanese restaurants in GTA. strongly recommended for whom like Japanese BBQ. they have two taste: salt and teriyaki. we always go with salt. Their sashimi plate is good too. Good place for hanging out with friends. However, it is expensive but we have to pay more to get same quality food when we visit Tokyo."}
{"text":"They use charcoal to BBQ the food which make the difference compare to others.  If you are looking for good quality Japanese food to please your tongue, this is the place to go.  Make sure you make reservation before you go, since this place is always full book."}
{"text":"great service,great staff,amazing taste of food.
you will feel like you are in Japan!
love charcoal grilled YAKITORI with SAPPORO!!"}
{"text":"The food actually are very good but we don't have a enjoyable experience at zakkushi. The service is so bad!!!! I just don't understand! They only gave us 40mins to eat, one chance to order. and we cooperate to order and eat as quickly as we can! we ordered 3 potato and 3 dessert for 3 PEOPLE, however they only offered 1(the potato and dessert) to us. And then we ask for another 2 dessert they said they can't give us the order( I can clearly remember we still have like 15mins to finish the dinner). I don't understand, it's their mistakes not ours. Anyway, I won't come here next time."}
{"text":"Their skewers are really good! Practically ordered almost everything between my two friends, except the sushi/sashimi and the odens. Our bill came pretty heavy, but the food is really good. Their drinks isn't worth the money though. 

Only reason I didn't like it to a 4 star was because of the time. I mean this is a pub, just Japanese style. I expect to chat with my friends and do some good drinking. But we were rushed out. The amount of times they came to check the clipboard to see when we're due to leave was quite annoying. They came every 10 mins to check, and we just sat down no longer than 20 mins. We thought they were checking on what food was out and needs to be coming in. They said the limit was 2 hours, but we were given the bill at 1 hour mark and at least 4 of our dishes haven't arrived yet. We made a reservation too! Just because we got seats right away without lining up, doesn't mean our seating time should be shorter. Not cool."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and only waited 10 minutes or so to be seated without prior reservation. 

This is my first time here so I ordered a wide range of items :P

I got the Sapporo with appetizer trio (Edamame/Ankimo (monkfish liver)/Hotaruika (baby squid), Zakkushi set (Yakitori), Yakitori Don, Cheese Yaki, Wagyu beef and Dorayaki Matcha Ice cream.

The service was quick and the waitress/waiter were very nice :D  The monkfish liver actually tasted pretty good with the sauce :D

The Zakkushi set tasted good especially they have different cook of the chicken/pork and also the sauce was great :D  However, the Wagyu wasn't what I expected in terms of the texture...  it is a little bit but the beef taste was good.  The skewer that I liked the most was actually the cheese Yaki~!!!!  It taste pretty awesome :D  

Another food item I really liked was the Yakitori Don :P  The half boiled egg was so good and they had some mayo with nori on the rice :P  the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly with smoky flavour and also pretty juicy.

Dorayaki Matcha ice cream is a MUST TRY!!!  I expected the pancake to be harden since it is served cold with the green tea ice cream.  The pancake part was actually very soft and moist!!!  The red bean paste with the green tea ice cream was perfect!!!

Overall, it is a great restaurant to try since they have such a wide variety of choice in the skewer and very nice and cozy environment.

However, the it can get a little pricey when you ordered alot of items~!!!  Also the wagyu beef was a little disappointment :("}
{"text":"Came here after a friend recommended it and I was not disappointed. 

They greet you in such a friendly manner when you enter. I went with my friend and boyfriend. Between the three of us, the bill came up to ~$90 (after tax, before tip) but we left satisfied. The portions are tiny and the price on the menu is per skewer. 

When you're seated, they bring over warm, moist towels for you to clean your hands and take your drink order. My boyfriend and best friend got the mojito while I just got tea, since I didn't feel like drinking but when the drinks arrived, I had a sip to try it. We were all very impressed. It tasted very nice (i liked the fact that it was made with rum, a lot of places use gin and I don't like it) and not too strong. It was so good that we ended up getting another round of mojitos and I got one myself. So between the 3 of us, we had 5 drinks. 

The skewers were nice and hot when they arrived. The quality of the good is great and it's good for sharing. We just ordered a whole bunch of skewers and shared everything. I really enjoyed the baby octopus (fried), the rice ball, salmon, chicken gizzard, quail egg wrapped in pork, just to name a few. There were others that we also enjoyed but I can't remember them all from the top of my head.

Will definitely be returning to try other items. Also, when you leave, the waitress actually signals the rest of the workers and they all say goodbye when you leave (in Japanese). Keep in mind that the cost will add up depending on how much you guys tend to eat (the three of us tend not to eat a whole lot) but according to the friend that recommended the place $90-$100 for three people sound about right."}
{"text":"A+! We came by around 6pm. At first I thought it would be too early, but when we entered people were already eating. We were lucky since we didn't reserve beforehand we still managed a seat for 2 hours. The staff were very welcoming in their shouts and accommodating. The wait between ordering and receiving is definitely worth it, everything on the menu is amazingly delicious. The total for two people went up to ~$80, but again, totally worth it. As recommended by an earlier reviewer, since it was our first time there, we ordered both sets and were not disappointed. Highly recommend for a night out!

Note: From the front I didn't see any other accessible entrance since we entered by climbing about 5 steps from the outside, and another 5 once inside. Hand rails are present."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey and they still nickel and dime you!
$2 for tea that other places normally just give you.
Ordered  chicken for like $7. It was a pretty small portion and they still serve you the bone in it.
Never coming back. Basically it was just the batter that cost me $7 because there was minimal  chicken in it."}
{"text":"Overall , we really like this restaurant. The atmosphere was lively. The servers were extremely helpful. They introduced all the skewers when they arrived our table. Also, I got some sauce on my white blouse and a server noticed and brought me soda water to clean it off. Much appreciated!


We began our meal with nankotsu (deep fried chicken knee cartilage), Agedashi Tofu and Amaebi Karrage (deep fried sweet prawn w/ Sansho salt). All of their deep fried items were very well done. They were crispy and flavourful without being too salty and oily. Love them!

Then we had some yakitori!


We had Chicken thigh, Chicken Wing and Asparagus wrapped with pork. These three were pretty generic and not that impressive. They were not bad but we will probably try something else next time.


The Tsukune (Chicken meat ball) was surprisingly good. We had the original one at first and the chicken was juicy and the texture was very interesting. We reordered two with melted cheese and Grated Daikon & Ponzu sauce. Yet we still think the original one was the best.


We also had Wagyu Beef and G beef (beef with Terriyaki sauce & garlic chips). The wagyu beef was more tendered and had more natural flavour of the beef. Definitely worth the price.


We also had Premium Beef Tongue, Unagi and Chicken skin. JW said the chicken skin was rather tasteless. We really enjoyed the unagi but found it a little pricy compared to other skewers. Unlike beef itself, the beef tongue was rather light and had a softer texture. I  recommend it to all the ladies out there who find beef to be rather heavy.


I love my yakioni (grilled rice). We had both the Shoyu (soy sauce) or Butter Shoyu (better soy sauce) yakioni. The whole thing tasted just like plain rice, even the grilled part. However, it went pretty well with the unagi which was slightly salty. But we will not order it next time.

We also tried their Oden with Chlkuwa (fish cake) and Daikon (carrot). We liked the sauce a lot. Very delicious.

Next, we had their takoyaki. The outer layer was very crispy while the inside was melting. Love it!

Lastly, we had their Ochazuke with salmon flakes. To be honest, I still haven't tried an ochazuke that is as good as the one I had in Japan last year. The broth of all the ones I have in Toronto (including this one) were rather tasteless and it felt like the rice was simply soaked in a slightly salted broth. I am still on a hunt for one that is comparable to the one I had in Japan! Please tell me if you guys have any recommendations!

We ended our meal with two amazing desserts!

Kinako mochi ice cream was my favourite! The mochi was slightly warmed and very chewy and went really well with the maple syrup. With the coldness of the ice cream, they created a very interesting and contrasting experience in the mouth. I will definitely reorder this next time I visit Zakkushi!

We also had the Dorayaki Matcha ice cream. Dorayaki is like a must have in like all yakotori or tappenyaki restaurants. Yet, we didn't like the one in Zakkushi because the pancake was rather dense and hard. It did not go very well with the ice cream.

Verdict:

roasted. 

We  had a really enjoyable dining experience an Zakkushi! Although not all the food was perfect, there were some extraordinary items that we looked forward to try again soon. We will definitely visit again!

visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/04/29/zakkushi/ for amazing pictures of the food I mentioned above! (:"}
{"text":"f'n sweet charcoal burnt lovliness.

great service as well.

yakitori and beer, what's not to like???"}
{"text":"Our favourite place for Japanese skewer fix. Unagi and pork &leek skewer are both simply AMAZING! Waygu skewer is nothing special, regular beef actually were less chewy. Scallops are just rubbers on a stick. 

Their deep fried dishes are on the weaker side

Overall good experience, got to keep in mind tho, everything looks cheap on the menu, but it really adds up quickly. However, it's worth the price tag when you get the right stuffs


Updated:

Went back last night, very disappointed. They really cheapen out on the food portion and quality. Food were mostly cold, and the really cutting back on the portion. Used to give 5 pieces per skewer now is down to 4 pieces for tomato and pork wrapped leeks. And the unagi got much smaller too. Will not return to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Awesome! Feel like you are in Japan again. Great food! Will definitely come back. Best in town!

Get the set and drink combo."}
{"text":"Wait time is a bit slow, takes like 10mins for each tiny cold skewer. Such a dissapointment since the last time I came here"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Even brought my parents here, though they weren't as fond of the noise level and \"saltiness\" of the skewers. It gets rather busy and there is a time limit so reservations are recommended.

Overall, the yakitori here are all of good/decent quality. I haven't tried something that I haven't enjoyed and I have almost tasted their entire menu. If I had to pick, the scallops would be the ones that paled in comparison to the rest of the items. I always order the Zakkushi set because it gives me a variety of what I love including the P-Toro, Me maki, Oropon beef and Umeshiso yaki. Other favourites include the chicken wing, lamb chop, bacon & asparagus and if I continue, I'd almost be listing their entire menu.

I also love their non-yakitori items including the nankotsu, ebimayo and kurage (jellyfish). Highly recommend the Negi P-Toro Don or Yakitori don- when you mix the half boiled egg and green onion sauce with the rice, it is heavenly.

They also have great Sapporo pitcher promotions in the summer for only $10 so I will be visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"Fun vibe! Kinda pricey, and a little cramped but its a good time. We ate everything. Skewers were hit and miss, some very overcooked. Takoyaki were exceptional as was the deep fried chicken. They take reservations! Bonus star for that."}
{"text":"Really Bad expreice there. We have waited  for 1 hour, the server said after 15 mins wait when we come in, after 15 mins they said another 15 mins wait, after 30 mins they said another 15 mins more. There are some table free and nobody wait expected us. We have waited for 1 hours they have any apologize. Really bad service there! Won't go again!"}
{"text":"Good place, friendly fast service (whole staff greets you when you sit down). Lots a good skewers cooked well. The wagyu beef, beef balls, chicken and shrimp were all good."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food and great vibe (with reservations!)
Cons: Slightly sketchy neighbourhood, can be expensive, and service has a few kinks.

Booked Zakkushi for a Saturday night for a birthday celebration. The atmosphere was great and the patrons were a mix of different ages and groups (uni students, couples, families). The place is decorated with aged dark woods, like a cozier, smaller Guu. The stools have built-in storage when you lift the lid, which is very smart.

The food is good. I particularly enjoyed the deep-fried mochi, kara-age, and juicy, flavourful, fried chicken wings. The kushiyaki is OK, but not memorable.

The mojito I had was very refreshing, although it tasted watered down (plus a bit pricy at $8.75, since I associate izakaya with plentiful drinking at more affordable prices with yummy eats).

Service has a few hiccups. They kept us waiting for a 7PM reservation (didn't get seated until 7:15/20), plus when we tried to signal the waitstaff for our bill, one server looked at us and walked away!

Overall, would go again, though it's very easy to run up an expensive bill with all those small bites and drinks, e.g., $40 pp (w/ one drink, after tax and tip)."}
{"text":"Delicious and I would totally go back! So many options from different types of meat and also different parts of the animal, different vegetable pairings and sauces too that there's bound to be something for everyone. Onion and pork skewer was my favourite. Also loved the mango beer!"}
{"text":"Lots of varieties. Some are REALLY good and some are just good, but most come in small portions and prices are per skewer - expensive! Atmosphere is vibrant great for a couple of ppl or a group."}
{"text":"It was my second time coming here on Wednesday and I have to say - I am still not impressed by it. I didn't really understand the hype about it before. Honestly, they have some good food, but service was meh. I sat down waiting for a friend as he was late, and I was never offered any water or anything. The tables are too close together, but I guess that is part of the experience/environment of the restaurant. 

This restaurant offers a variety of dishes in skewers. There are a lot of options on the menu, and I honestly never know what to order (I don't do well with big menus with lots of options). We ordered some creamy udon noodles, some ramen noodle dish, ebi mayo (shrimp), chicken karaage (fried chicken) and random dishes of beef and chicken skewers (I can't remember their names). Overall, the food was delicious, but I thought it was overpriced for skewers. For example, the cheaper skewers would be $1.80 or $2.20 FOR ONE. You can see how that bill can rack up...

Overall, would not come back again unless I really have to. Oh, and they put a $7 Wagyu Beef skewer on our bill when we CLEARLY told them we did not order it during our meal."}
{"text":"I have long been waiting for a place that reminds me of the real Izakayas from Japan. In the past couple years, many fusion resterauant have opened and there was always something missing. However--- after visiting Zakkushi today, all the memories came back, all the ritual you do at the Izakayas in Tokyo, the Asian men in suits drinking beer and laughing, or a bunch of girls giggling ;ordering dishes after dishes, and of course the people taking pictures of every beautiful thing that is on the table.This was all so authentic. The design of the place was perfect enough for its customers, staying true to the original. The location is also very interesting, I am starting to like the taste of these ramen/ Izakaya owners, they seem to have done a lot of research and know what is the next up and coming area. Impressive.  

My favorite dishes were ( pardon my spelling on the Japanese  names) 01. Daigon Salad  02. Garlic Chicken Ball  03. Mochi with Vanilla Ice cream  04. Grilled Rice Ball / Nigiri  05. Grilled Quail eggs

I have been to no less then 30 Izakayas in cities in Asia, New York, Vancouver , LA and Toronto. I'd say this one is top 5. Given that izakaya food is suppose to be just snacks / bar food, but they really make sure the food and presentation if top level-- but not take it too far like Guu or Momofuku ( fusion).

2 people, $65 including drinks. Quality food, authentic ambience, and superb services!"}
{"text":"Good vibe but food was a bit of a miss. By the time the food got to our table it was actually cold and the waiter fought me on wanting to get it exchanged for fresh food. Don't think I would ever give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Lively place. Tried almost half the menu, skewers are hit and miss. They have dedicated containers to hold your discarded skewer sticks. 

Shrimp was good.
Sockeye salmon overlooked and dry."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the BEST skewer place in the GTA. 

To get straight to the point, I had the best beef tongue here at Zakkushi. The premium wagyu beef is also sooooo delicious. 

If it's your first time visiting, I suggest ordering both of their skewer sets to taste all they have to offer. I liked everything that came out of that kitchen. 

Their homemade ginger ale is also a must-order. Also, did I mention a pitcher of Sapporo is only $12.99? 

The atmosphere and friendly, upbeat service makes me want to come back. Even if the food was mediocre, I would be back just for the positive vibes! 

Zakkushi brings you back to the alleys of Tokyo - the whole experience was so authentic. I ate here two times this week already (Sorry diet), I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Omomom best and fair price. I will definitely come back.

Sit in the bar and been serve by the chef. 

They all japanese with a so so english. The food and service was very good. The have a good sake list. Sell in bottle or 300ml or 120ml. 

Fish are fresh and buttery. The rice was perfectly cook and not much on the nigiris. You can feel each piece of rice rolling in your mouth in each bites.

I think for what a had is a great value."}
{"text":"I think the key here is not to expect to be eating a real dinner kind of meal - it's more of a snack/drink kind of place, if you have the money for expensive snacks.
It's true that the skewers are hit and miss. I really loved the eel and meatball options but others like the tofu was just downright bland.
I can't deny that I did enjoy my time spent here, though! And the service throughout our visit was great.
Overall my experience was good and I would rate 3.5."}
{"text":"Didn't feel the need to make a reservation since we were going at 7pm on Thursday. But the upstairs was apparently full (at least couple of tables were empty but I guessed they were reserved?) and we were directed to the sushi bar downstairs after waiting for 10 minutes. 

We ordered 3 appetizers + sake set for $11? The appetizers were great, especially the gomae-ae. Could've provided more seaweed for tako-wasabi. 

We also ordered zakkushi skewers set and chicken karage. Hands down the best chicken karage I've had for the price. Very well seasoned and really juicy!

To finish off, we had Mochi ice-cream. Not bad but nothing new."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Very friendly staff and very good food...especially the wagyu beef skewers.

Tables are a little bit cramped but I chalk that up to the whole authentic Japanese experience.

Definitely recommend if you're looking for a unique dining experience"}
{"text":"Although the food is delicious, whenever the first plate of skewers shows up at the table, I can't help but think, \"That's way smaller than it looks on the menu!\" I guess quality food comes at a price but did they have to photograph it in macro mode or whatever they did to make everything look so big and juicy in those drool-worthy menu photos?

Anyway, skewer size aside, I pretty much enjoy any of their meats with salt on top, but I find teriyaki too sweet. I like how you can get some innards here too, like chicken gizzards.  The sashimi dishes are good too, big chunks of fish and seems high quality to me.  But the dishes that stand out are the ones that feature ingredients you can't find anywhere else! And that's the great thing about Zakkushi...you get to try a bit of everything!  The drink menu always has interesting sounding choices on it, but I haven't tried much off there.

Overall, I think Zakkushi is a must-try izakaya, but I find I've been leaving either a) With a reasonably priced bill but not super stuffed or b) Super happy and full, but feeling like my wallet is a lot lighter than when I came in.  Maybe the solution is, I should drink more and eat less."}
{"text":"I was overwhelmed with the menu when I first visited. There are many items that you can't easily figure out how they taste, and not a lot of them sound very filling. It's probably one of the most expensive restaurants I could go to because most items on the menu are ordered PER skewer. Each skewer is a little bigger than the size of your index finger and cost $2~8.
They serve really really great food, no question about that. However I just can't get over how expensive the bill can get. As some have suggested, pre-eat before you come here.
The atmosphere is very authentic and the servers were nice and responsive. I would come back (with a full stomach) for hanging out with friends for a beer and a set of 5 skewers that they have on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the service was below average compared to most Japanese restaurants I've been. But the cherry on top was at the end after we paid the bill. We split the check and we were on our way out when a member of the staff chased us down because he didn't think our tip as good enough, and demanded more. According to the waiter, one of us did not tip. When my friend, who was sure he tipped, ask to see the receipt the waiter said \"Oh, no, is not a problem\", after 5 minutes. Making the evening unpleasant to everyone. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"People - if you come to Toronto, do your mouth a favor and come here. 


Seriously one of the best meals I have had in a good long while. This was our last dinner in Toronto before heading back to the states the next day and it was WELL worth this hike from the distillery district. 

Food: I couldn't even recommend anything in particular, EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS. I think all in all I ordered 12 skewers? Maybe more, I don't know - I was in a blissful haze. Order a pitcher of Sapporo and kick back with good friends and enjoy the atmosphere. We waited 30-40min for a seat and it was definitely worth it.

Ambiance: part of the charm of this place - you definitely get the feeling of being in an izakaya here. The vibe is just...rambunctious for lack of better word. Wait staff are friendly. 

Do it. Seriously."}
{"text":"Great place for grilled (yakitori) meats/seafood and fried anything. Service is friendly, it seem authentically Japanese as izakayyas go here, and prices are ok. Ambience-wise prefer guu over Zakkushi as Zakkushi seems more family friendly :)

We had wagyu beef, scallops, octopus and fried chicken. 

Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! probably  my favorite yakitori restaurant. if your a fan of japanese bbq,  this place is a must visit!@"}
{"text":"Love everything here (except the price but it's not a big deal lol) I went to the other location in Vancouver also. Food were all tasty. Recommend:)"}
{"text":"I have tried the Zakkushi in Vancouver a few times, but this was my first time at the Toronto location. The first thing I noticed upon walking in was that it was significantly larger than the Vancouver location (Denman St). We ordered a slew of items such as various skewers, an udon dish, tsukunes, sashimi, seaweed salad and jellyfish. The one downside is that the portions are small so make sure you moderate your eating so you don't get an astronomical bill.  During this dinner, the top awards go to the tsukune skewers and the udon carbonara (cream sauce with cod roe). The tsukune skewers had a delicate texture and great presentation. Very tasty as well. The Udon Carbonara was a simple dish resembling a Linguine Alfredo dish, but with cod roe and onions. The udon had a perfect chewiness to it and the cream sauce coated the noodle perfectly making me crave more.

At the end, we decided to order 3 out of the 4 desserts on the menu: Annin Tofu, Dorayaki Matcha Ice Cream and the Hochija Pudding. Our favs were the Tofu and the Pudding. The tofu dessert was great for the pallette and the berry sauce added just the right amount of sweetness. The pudding is a black bubble tea infused creme brulee. It was creamy yet very delicate in flavour.

For two people, our bill came to $90 which is reasonable for this type of Japanese restaurant in the GTA."}
{"text":"I am a regular since they first open. From old menu to the new menu. Though prices increased, food changed variety but still would choose to come back to this izakaya in Toronto just cause there isn't one that can do it exactly in their style. The location is convenience for me as it is just off the highway. 
Atmosphere reminds me of Tokyo. I guess I'm here for the memory over food and drinks. 
Food is really good in terms of grill and skewers. 
*Make reservation, or else prepare to wait 30mins+ even at 9pm.*

**NEW review: I went here last night. We sat downstairs where it used to be the 'sushi bar' but now they have closed down and became zakkushi as well. We all had dinner elsewhere before we arrive at zakkushi at 9:30pm. Wait was 30mins or so. 

The server who served us was quite rude. From what I know, restaurants who sells alcohol must sell food. But where was it mandatory that customers order drinks must also order food? Someone enlighten me please. 
So someone ordered a dorayaki (dessert) the waitress said, wait I need to ask if that's allow. (dessert is not food?) I asked why we must order food, her replied was \"why? because we are not a bar\" ..... I was mind blown! her attitude plus the way she gave us looks earns no respect! Since when an izakaya can't be just drinking? Even if I order drinks at any restaurant, I don't HAVE TO order food with my drinks. Just terrible service that I am really upset with. First time ever!**"}
{"text":"I dined here last night with my sister and a friend and we all enjoyed our whole experience. Since it was a Wednesday, we didn't make reservations, but we did make sure we were there right at 5:30. We were the first group to be seated and it got pretty busy after, but it wasn't 100% full at any point. It's an upbeat, fun, and exciting place to dine. The servers are all friendly and service is fast. 

We ordered many different items and we enjoyed every single one. I definitely recommend trying both the Premium Set and the Zakkushi Set. Very good meats and flavours. The stand outs for me was the Umeshisho Yaki and the Wagyu Beef Tsukine. For appetizers I really enjoyed the Kawahagi and the Ankimo and for dessert the Hojicha pudding. And of course wash it all down with some Sake or Sapporo! 

I had never been to a primarily Yakitori restaurant before and it was a great experience. The price can add up pretty quickly because the portions are small, but you get to try a lot of different things because they have such a great assortment of dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"I feel like this is one of the more authentic japanese izakayas in Toronto.  We had a number of dishes:
-  2 types of chicken skewers - these were OK
- 1 crunchy and juicy pork skewer - this was pretty good
- zucchini skewer - not worth the money...
- scallop skewer - the scallops were kinda thin
- assorted sashimi platter - quite good and really fresh!
- yam fries - meh....
- edamame - we ordered these cuz the waiter told us that there might be a long wait for the food, but most of it came quickly so we barely touched these

We made reservations ahead of time but were seated right in front of the grill which made our clothes smell like the grill after.  It was quite busy on the saturday evening that we went, but there was no line (which i was told is unusual).

I think I prefer going to Guu' over this izakaya.  

Tip: call ahead to make reservations if you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"- do not compare this place to guu. it's apples and oranges. 
- now that that's out of the way.... zakkushi is great. 
- what more can you ask for. grilled skewers of awesome-ness ranging.
- would recommend 3 items:
1) oropon tsukune (grated daikon and ponzu on a chicken meatball skewer)
2) cheese mochi maki (sticky rice, wrapped with pork and cheese)
3) uzura maki (quail eggs wrapped in pork)
- a little on the pricey side (about $2 to $3 on average per skewer)... so if you gorge, you'll pay for it..."}
{"text":"It smelt awful when we walked in. The smell started outside the door and lingered into the restaurant. I could smell it despite being uber sick and having a stuffy nose. I know I shouldn't really be out and about.

I ordered the ebi ten udon, teriyaki salmon skewer, shiitake mushroom and special for the day: mentai udon (carbonara style). I'll work backwards. The creamy udon was really good but nothing spectacular! I felt like it was a dish I can whip up at home. Shiitake mushroom was awful and so was the radish on top. The teriyaki salmon was not only tiny but over cooked (dry!) and the ebi ten udon did not look anything like the picture. In fact it may have been missing se ingredients and have other ingredients added which were not listed on the menu.

Overall, not a horrible experience but will definitely not be coming back. 

Service was decent despite be pressured into ordering desserts near the end and then being reminded all our order was already served so *hint* *hint* are u guys done eating? Can we get you the bill and kick you out soon! They were very polite about it though which is the only reason why my stars are relatively high for such a negative experience and the fact that I'm not angry!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com. Worth checkin out!                   A

Atmosphere is unique.

Yakitori was the best!"}
{"text":"Best Yakitori in the downtown core. The staff are attentive and the menu speaks for itself. You will think that you are in Nagano."}
{"text":"Zakkushi was always my first go to place for skewers in downtown. Haven't been here for few months and we decided to celebrate anniversary in zakkushi today. We didn't make reservation so decided to come early. Arrived at 5:40pm and the restaurant was half full . 
The server told us we have the table until 7pm and we both thought it's enough time for us since we eat super fast. But the reality is we wait until 6:30 to get our first skewer.

Surprisingly , the skewers are noticeably smaller than before and the tastes are BAD . not sure if they changed chef or not, the skewers are either too salty or the chicken heart is not fully cooked :(


The server kept coming to our table and reminded us of the time... We only have 30 mins to eat and fault was not on us! We waited 40 mins to get our first skewer!!! He told me it's time for last call at 6:40 , when we still waiting for 70% of skewer to come. He is not rude but I felt he was hoping us to leave asap.. really upset ...


I have to mention they also increase the price a lot! Premium set was 19.5 before and now it's 22.5. Everything on the menu was increased 20%!


We were very disappointed this time and would not recommend this place any more ."}
{"text":"great ambiance: Japanese greetings as usual
recommend: Wagyu beef, tender and juicy. 
Umeshiso yaki(chicken thigh with sour plum and Japanese basil) interesting combination
Dessert: Dorayaki Macha ice cream, a must
about $45 per person, was a hearty meal
better make reservations esp for weekends"}
{"text":"This place can get real busy real fast. I had tried to do a walk in but the last two attempts had been futile. Not wanting to take a chance I called well in advance and was told that there is a two hour seating limit on the weekend. Ah well. 
First off the place is loud so unless you are willing to whatsapp forget about chatting with someone who are not seated next to you. 
We ordered a whole bunch of grilled items (somehow forgot to order the eel) we are talking beef tongue, chicken liver, heart, thigh, meat ball etc. In addition we ordered some no yakitori items as well. This included takoyaki, ebimayo, mushrooms etc. 
For drinks we stuck to sapparo and and cocktail. 
Now for surprise the Yakitori was decent not great and the cooked items were quite good. 
Service was decent. I would say 3 stars."}
{"text":"Right now this is my number one favourite restaurant in Toronto. I've been 5 times in the past month alone and can't get enough. Super authentic Japanese yakitori that reminds me of Tokyo. The service is outstanding and fun. Noisy and exciting when busy as the waiters are yelling orders across the restaurant and the traditional welcome and thank you to guests coming and going. The yakitori skewers are amazingly delicious! I've tried almost one of everything on the menu. You must try this place out!"}
{"text":"Hooray for another Vancouver resto invading Toronto!  Keep 'em coming!!!

Skewers were flavourful and meats were tender.  Sashimi was fresh (sockeye salmon).  Chicken karaage was really crispy and juicy.  Mmmm the cod was so gooooood.  The fresh tuna rolls were really good as well.  Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekend night with the girlfriend and friends. The place is small  and cozy. Like Guu, be prepared for an onslaught of greetings shouted when you enter and when you leave. I'm not a fan but sure makes you feel welcome and appreciated when you leave. 

Our bill was $190. We pretty much ordered every skewer possible. The best dishes were:
wagyu beef
Takoyaki 
Unagi

The takoyaki was very soft and were the best I've ever had. We also tried beef tongue for the first time and it tasted like soft chewy steak. It's not as bad as you think. 

The only downsides were that the wait can be long if you don't have reservations. The skewers are expensive and it's easy to spend over $100 for two. Aside from those few standout dishes, all the other skewers were mediocre."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and it ended up around 35$ per person for food. Feels like it was more \"worth it\" than the other izakaya restaurant at its price since most of the \"authentic Japanese restaurants\" are expensive anyways. But well, first the food in Zakkushi are good and second they have a great range of food variations. And the bonus is the drink. The alcohol they have are really unique but classic, which I believed they spent some time on the selection. The alcohol are expensive (for sure) but I was glad that I tried (got 2 kind and happy with both)."}
{"text":"Well all i have to say is that during our vacation here in Toronto, we were definitely on a mission looking for the best of the best in Japanese cuisine and with all the great Izakaya's we have in Hawaii, it's really hard to compare the Japanese food in Hawaii as opposed to the Japanese food they offer here in Toronto. But at Zakkushi on Carlton, we were pleasantly surprised and satisified with our dining experience here.

 I truly love a place that is hopping and busy and at Zakkushi, we went on a Sunday night and this place was packed to the gills and were greeted with the \" IRASSHAIMASE \" welcome that everyone seems to get whenever there is a customer being seated. The restaurant looks very tight upon walking in, but as you walk through the restaurant, it is actually pretty spacious being that i'm a pretty big guy and i like sitting pretty comfortably.

 As for the menu, it has a nice balance of Yakitori items to Appetizers and Salad's and Seafood as well which is good for me because i love trying a whole bunch of things on the menu. As for the price point here, i wouldn't call this place very expensive, but your bill can add up quite a bit if you are not careful. As for me. i could care less because when you are on vacation, i want to eat everything and anything i can get my hands on. As for the Yakitori, i thought almost everything we ate were quite outstanding and flavorful, and i also like the fact that everything you order is priced per skewer and not in two's like most places i go to. The only thing i didn't like about some items on Zakkushi's Yakitori selection was that the cuts on some items were almost too small and not as generous as you would like it to be, but all in all i wasn't that bad. I just think other people might think otherwise because some people just can't see themselves paying that much per piece. As for the Yakitori items we had, here was a snippet of what we did try...

 Wagyu Beef w/ Oropon Sauce ($6.80 per piece)
 
 Lamb Chop: ($6.80 per piece)

 Cheese Tsukune: ($2.00 per piece)

 Tebasaki or Chicken Wing: ($2.00 per piece)

 Negi Yaki: ($2.00 per piece)

 Oropon Beef: ($2.50 per piece)

 Gyu Tongue: ($2.00 per piece)

 Garlic Prawn: ($2.80 per piece)

 Scallop: ($2.80 per piece)

 Eryngi Mushroom ($2.00)

 Of all of the pieces of Yakitori we indulged on, the Wagyu Beef, Cheese Tsukune, and Tebasaki were well prepared and seasoned to perfection. All the other's were good but nothing to leave a ;lasting impression on me. They weren't terrible but nor was it worth remembering as well.

 As for the Seafood, we were pleasantly surprised how delicious it was, especially being a Yakitori place and not being known for their seafood, but i thought the items we ordered were a perfect compliment with the Yakitori items we ordered because i like switching gears in between bites and we were very satisfied with what we ate. Here were some of the things we tried..

 Salmon and Avocado Carpaccio ($7.80)

 Seafood Salad ($8.50)

 Assorted Sashimi Platter ($13.50)

 Ankimo or Monkfish Liver ($5.20)

 Katsuo Tataki (????)

 Ebi Mayo ($7.50)

 Beef Tataki ($8.60)

 Oden ( Five items for $6.80)

 Annin Tofu ($3.80)

 Black Sesame Ice Cream ($3.80)

 All i can say about the food here at Zakkushi is that almost everything we have tried was truly amazing for the price you pay and the presentation is typical Japanese presentation where everything is placed beautifully on the plate and consistent in terms of taste and flavor. What i really liked about the vibe here at Zakkushi was that although very loud and noisy, i love the way the server's all work well together. I loved how different server's came to our table's without no one screwing up on our orders and not once were we ever rushed unlike our dining experience at Guu Izakaya where we were sat like sardines and were trying to rush us out which is one thing i can't stand. Unlike our dining experience at Zakkushi, we felt welcomed and unrushed and the server's were very upbeat and even had time to chat with us. Those are the qualities that made my dining experience here at Zakkushi an evening to remember unlike our dining experience at Guu where you are treated like a herd of cattle.

 Let's just say that Zakkushi left such a wonderful impression on us, guess where we ate the next evening? At their Sushi Restaurant below Zakkushi called Sushiya which i will review later. Of all the Japanese places we ate at here in Toronto, i would have to put Zakkushi on the top of our list. Great service and excellent food is the perfect combination for a person like me and if i'm ever in Toronto again, this will definitely be a place i will frequent once again.

{"text":"Always love a place where are can drink drink and eat a little. This place is amazing. 
The skewers are order by each and since some of us are not beef eater. We can choose which one to order more.... Service is amazing! We were a larger group of 10 people and reordered many many times and they didn't mess up anything. 

To be honest, we were at another restaurant earlier that night and we decided to switch place. Coincidentally enough, we saw two are groups of people who came to Zakkushi after the first restaurant too."}
{"text":"I first came here with some classmates and had a really great experience. We shared some skewers sets and the carbonara. For some of us, it was our first beef tongue.

I took my partner here months later, and was relieved that the food did not disappoint! We ordered the premium and Zakkushi sets, a mushroom skewer and a tomato skewer (which I felt was random but surprisingly flavourful), and takoyaki (it's very hard to mess that up). The meats are soft and juicy.

We also each got one of their fruity sours (mango pineapple and something with berries), which were well worth the price.

I look forward to going back when my body is ready for the grill :)"}
{"text":"Closer to three and a half, but I gave the bump up because I love all Guu-chain bathrooms.  Just the best!

Arrived right at 5:30 (wish they opened at 5....) on Sunday, and we were among at least twenty people -- no line yet (asked if we had made reservations, so I guess they do take them) but when we left around 6:45 there was a line-up.

Got to sit by the open-grilling-kitchen, in a little cubby - totally cute (I think these aren't considered \"good\" seats, but I love sitting side by side while sharing) and you shove your jacket and accessories into the seat, as it opens up to be a little storage box.

Drink: cassis liquer and pineapple juice.  Really good.  Goes too quickly for $5.

We waved the waitress over to order our food, and she said, \"Do you want any drinks?\" and we said yes, but we were starving so we were ready to order, and she said, \"Oh, I have to take your drink order first.\"  Weird, but ok....then she left and never came back, so we had to desperately (after waiting ten minutes at least) wave another waitress over and plead to order our food (since they have to write the order on a specific slip, and our Drink Lady took the slip with her).  We went to order some skewers, but seeing our hungry desperation, second waitress suggested we order from the appetizer section as well because skewers can take a while.

From the appetizer section we had the seafood salad (sometimes slimy, this time crispy and fresh) and edamame.  

From the skewers we had the premium set and the zakkushi set -- must haves, order these plus a few other specific ones you want to try, because both sets are great value and delicious.

My favourite skewers were the wagyu beef, the quail eggs wrapped in pork, and the chicken liver.  

Quieter than other Guu locations, but still of the same shouting-vein."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing service, great atmosphere....Loved the matcha ice cream in the red bean pancakes!"}
{"text":"A must try, this place takes bbq skewers to the next level with the flavors.  Can get pricy if you have a big stomach."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. A good friend of mine took me here and after waiting 30-40 minutes for a table I have to say the expectations were high. I was not disappointed. The wait is long if you haven't made a reservation, so learn from our mistakes and make that reservation! 
The place was packed to the brim on a Friday night but service did not slow down. I tried a lot of items so here's a short list of must try's that stood out for me:

Gyu (beef) tongue - $2 
Uzura Maki (Bacon wrapped quail eggs) - $2.1
Yakioni with butter - so delicious! $2
Me Maki - $1.9
Bacon asparagus - $2.4

The only thing about this place is that the bill does tend to add up because price is per skewer instead of per two which is common at other izakaya restaurants. Still, the quality and preparation of the food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"First time visit last night and I'm sure it won't be the last one. I'm happy that I was with a friend who had been here before and highly recommended it otherwise it's very likely that I'd never have found the place! 

Anyway, what to say? The décor is simple but really nice. The staff is SUPER friendly and efficient. The place is clean. The only drawback in my opinion is the noise level, making it hard to have a normal conversation. But then again, I'm super sensitive to noise and I tend to be very picky. 

As for the food, I tasted a chicken skewer and it was pure perfection. The chicken melted in the mouth and at $1.9 a piece I'm sure I could eat several! I also had the ice cream that was made of some kind of sesame with raspberry... Sounds weird, right? But don't let it fool you: the combination of the different flavours of the raspberry, sesame and whipped cream is heavenly! Since I had eaten at Kinton ramen already this is all I had here. 

I'll definitely come back and update my review at that time. For now, all I can say is that I really enjoyed everything I saw and tasted."}
{"text":"Wait was very short and the wooden traditional decor is nice. The service is OK, not very courteous but they were busy so that was expected. Atmosphere is lively. The first thing I ordered was an avocado tuna wrap that came with very I unripe avocado that was as hard as a cucumber. (Nama Harumaki) Now I understand that sometimes avocados aren't in season but I do not think restaurants should ever serve something if it is going to taste awful. The yakitori was mediocre and in all honesty the first dish ruined my experience. Would not go again or recommend."}
{"text":"Food:
-it is a place for drinks and grilled. its very similar to the stores i went to when i was in tokyo. Compared to other izakaya (guu or fin), it is a real japanese style in terms of the food flavor, decoration and menu. 

Price:
-similar to other izakaya. avg is $35-50 per person depends how much you drink =P

Location and others
-I like the fact that you can make reservation and it is easy to park there. 
-However, it is not near subway. its around 15mins walk from college station. 

service:
--hot food usually very slow (sepcailly for skewers)
--overall service in japanese store is really good"}
{"text":"The food here was quite good.  I enjoyed most everything.  Food always tastes better when served on a stick or in a ball shape... :)

The staff were very friendly, but service was slow and the atmosphere was unnecessarily noisy.  I realize that's the norm for an Izakaya, but it just didn't seem to make sense at this place.  The hard stool seating was uncomfortable as expected (similar to other similar places)."}
{"text":"Out of 5
Food (3.5) Service (5) Atmosphere (4) 

Arrived at 7 on a Monday night with no wait. There were tables available throughout the night. They do take reservations, which you should probably make if you're going on the weekends.
We started off with a Sake & Appetizer combo for only $9.99, which is a great deal. They also have a Soju or beer combo for the same price. 

Most of the beef skewers we had were slightly overcooked for our liking, but the tastes were pretty amazing. The chicken skewers were surprisingly so-so, except the Chicken Skin which was delicious! Highly recommend the chicken skin with teriyaki sauce. 

Do NOT order the spicy squid app. It was just an explosion of rotten fish and salt, which only got progressively saltier until you couldn't even think straight. 
But on the brighter side....

The Cheese Mochi Maki was a hit, which was sticky rice, pork, and melted cheese on a skewer. 
The absolute favourite of the night was the Kimchi Yaki-udon. I actually prefer this one over the yaki-udon from Guu.  I will definitely come back just for this!"}
{"text":"Lots of crazy good Japanese food, serving sizes are small but if you get a lot and split amount friends it'll fill you up. The service was also very friendly. Highly recommend the fried prawns."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves yakitori and Japanese tappas. The staff were friendly, the greeting style reminds me of Guu, where all the staff members greet you and say farewell. There is a patio area in the front, and wooden booths and benches inside. The delicious smell of charcoal grilled food fills the air from the open kitchen.

To accompany the Sapporo beer we tried a variety of dishes. We tried the yakitori premium set, which comes with waygu beef, duck breast, chicken, and beef tongue. I think the set is good to try once; since you get to try them all, but not sure it was worth the price. The waygu beef was soft and tender, but the meat didn't have much flavour. I did enjoy the duck breast. Because the meat was grilled, it had a nice smoky flavour. 

I recommend trying the lamp chop if you like lamb. The lamb chop was soft and tender, and didn't have a strong lamb smell. I also really enjoyed the takoyaki. I loved the batter and amount of sauce they served over the takoyaki was perfect. The takowasabi (chopped raw octopus) was nice, the wasabi flavour really comes through, and adds a kick to the dish. It's nice when eaten with the seaweed. The one dish I disliked and would never order again was the Hotaruika - marinated fresh baby squid. The texture was really slimy, and just something I didn't enjoy. 

We also tried some of the oden toppings. I really enjoyed this. We choose the original oden broth, it was really nice and light, and it had a lot a depth. We tried the hanpen, daikon, and gyusuji (beef tendon). The hanpen (fluffy fish cake) was my favourite. It was yummy, the texture was soft and had a nice airiness to it. Since I love sashimi were ordered the tuna and sashimi set.  The fish was fresh and nicely cut. It was the first time I've tried the sock eyed salmon as sashimi.

I enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. I suggest coming with another person or a group so that you get to try more of the dishes. I'll be back to try some more of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of six - I recommend making a reservation. It was hard to make a reso because they don't pick up the phone often so keep trying until you get one.

The food was decent. I didn't find the skewers any special or memorable. It can also add up if you are feeling hungry that day and want to keep drinking. But if you want the authentic Japanese izakaya - this is a good place to try.

If you want a quieter atmosphere - ask to sit in the basement level. 

Service was decent but can be slow at times."}
{"text":"I have to say this place beats Kintaro on church, even tho I like Kintaro's polar beer. Both Zakkushi and Kintaro are Yakitori (Japanese skewer) bars and their quality of Yakitori are good. I feel that Zakkushi has more options and every dish of theirs has a same good quality, whereas dishes other than Yakitori are not so great in Kintaro. 

5/5 Tonshabu Salad $6 - full of flavours!

4.5/5 Oden (chef's pick) $6.8 - came with Daikon, tofu, ikamaki(fish cake with squid), shirataki and chikuwa. I don't see a lot of Oden in Toronto. I was so excited about it! Daikon and Ikamaki were my favourite.  

Skewers I ordered:

5/5 Wagyu beef $6.8 - I just want more
      Umeshiso Yaki $1.9 - I love the sourness and a hint of Japanese basil on the chicken thigh. Nice combination
      
4.5/5 Oropon beef $2.5 - love it. The onion really did a good job so that you can just keep earring it without feeling greasy. 4 star cuz I had the Wagyu beef

4/5 P-toro $2, Cheese Yaki $1.9, Mé Maki $1.9, Eringi $2, Zucchini $1.7, Horumon -  Decent flavour, just the way you want them to be. good but not so much surprises 
      Momo $1.6 (teriyaki and sea salt) - I usually prefer sea salt with skewers like this. But here in Zakkushi, I like the teriyaki a bit more. 

3/5 Quail egg wrapped w/ pork $2.1 - neither my friend nor I could really taste the pork. It taste just like normal hard boiled eggs cooked in soy sauce. 
      Tofu(w/ soy sauce) $2 - can't really taste the soy sauce. It was just to bland to be a decent bar food.

Drink I ordered:
3.5/5 Lemon honey soda - regular sweet lemon honey infused soda 
4/5 Umeshu+pineapple juice - very tropical! Definitely a girls' drink cuz you can hardly taste any alcohol in it"}
{"text":"Cozy and intimate place where you can go with a friend or a date. All the skewers are made from very fresh ingredients and they are all very flavourful! If you are a meat lover this is definitely the place for you! vegetarian not so much. They have a very nice but small patio outside the decorations of the restaurant was very traditional. Servers are nice and knowledgeable of what they serve. They have special pitcher of beer with a very decent price, which is much needed when you are eating bbq skewers. Great place great food!"}
{"text":"I was so so so close to giving this place a 5 star but some dishes just didn't follow through, y'know? And for the price they're charging (considering it's an Izakaya), I just can't let it slide. 

Came here with the boy tonight for a celebratory dinner so we already knew we were going to walk away with one less maple-syrup-smelling dolla bill. But boy, I must say, some of the dishes we had tonight really impressed me!

Dishes I loved, 5/5: 
-Giant Scallop ($8 per skewer) = But trust me, it's probably wise to each have your own skewer because one piece isn't enough! These were absolutely delicious. They had an amazing smoky flavour that balanced the buttery and savoury goodness of the scallops that were indeed giant. 
-Chicken Karaage ($6.2) = Yuuuuum! Super tender chicken deep fried in a light and crisp batter that's lightly salted. The pieces are great control portions that won't give me canker sores in the morning but were also just enough to satisfy any of my inner deep fried cravings. 
-Dorayaki Matcha Ice Cream ($4) = IF ANY'S A TIME, THIS IS THE TIME TO USE #BLESSED. I don't know if it's just me but I thoroughly loved this dessert. The dorayaki was soft and fluffy, sandwiching what I would argue is the best restaurant-served matcha ice cream ever - it had a super rich and creamy flavour! The red bean pasta was also a delightful ingredient that wasn't too sweet but was clearly detectable with each bite!  

Dishes I enjoyed, but felt there could be room for improvement, 4/5:
-Takoyaki ($5.5) = These were freshly made, had solid chunks of octopus inside, and topped with the infamous dried bonito flakes. My only suggestion would be to improve the presentation because it came in a small bowl stacked in a pyramid that made the bottom ones a little soggy and deprived of the drizzling of sauce. 
-Yakitori Don SP ($7.8) = Decently tasty and great visual presentation BUT lacking in warmth-keeping capacity. I always find rice bowl dons disappointing when they cool down much too soon for me to fully enjoy the dish. 

Dishes that were just ok, 3/5:
-Sumibi Yaki Wagyu Steak ($26) = Right from the start, considering the price of this dish and the fact that it's wagyu steak, I had set really high expectations.. and they were poorly unmet. I always thought the more you paid for steak, the more buttery and mouth-melting they would be. Clearly in this scenario, that wasn't true. The slices of wagyu steak were actually surprisingly a lot tougher than most medium-rare steaks. Quite disappointing and not at all worth its price.
-Kinako mochi ice cream ($4) = Interesting concept, really. Definitely a dessert that I've never tried before but after having it, I must say that I've had my share and will unlikely order it ever again. It's rather plain: just a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with diluted maple syrup and with 4 balls of mochi on the side. The mochi was also like a dried and hardened piece of candy, when I expected it to be soft and pliable, and was a little too sweet for my liking since it was already paired with vanilla ice cream.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for any celebratory purposes or if you're just feeling down for splurging! Amazing food, authentic atmosphere, and genuine staff. Just make sure you make reservations beforehand unless you're willing to wait a considerable amount of time because this place is PACKED all throughout the evening.. even past 11pm!"}
{"text":"OK food, another overrated izakaya IMO. Food was decent, nothing stood out for me to repeat. Tried several skewers, noodles and such. Service was ok. Turned off by the seating time limitation."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I was never disappointed here, only amazed. I thought some things were unbelievable and I prefer this hands down to an other izakaya I've been to in Canada. I'm not keen on Ramen, but I was willing to go a Ramen resto on Gerrard because of the great confidence I have in their management. 
This was also a great place for people who do not know Izakaya, or Japanese food, they cannot help but to love this place. I prefer this place to Guu for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. The food there is fantastic, and the service there is outstanding. 

Starting off with the service, the people there always make me feel welcome. From when we arrive, they yell welcome, and then take us to our seats. The downer is that it is usually packed with people. If you go on a weekend evening, sometimes you have to wait over an hour to get a place.

I love yakitori, and have been looking for a good place in Toronto for quite some time. I have gone to many places that have yakitori, but none compare to this. The bacon garlic tips are fantastic and the chicken cartilage is just right. The sashimi is really fresh. 

The atmosphere overall is great. Not too loud, but not too quiet either. I am not sure exactly how to explain it, but is is a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Made reservations almost a week in advance (the online reservations weren't working so I had to call in). 

Overall it was a good experience, very authentic feeling and good service. The only thing I would really complain about would be that there are certain things that are hit and miss but if you are someone that frequents here, then you would have probably found exactly what you like which would make it a good experience. 

We had the Yama yuzi shibori which is a mix of sake, alcohol and citrus flavour. It was expensive ($33.50 for 300mL) but it was really good if you're someone that likes citrus. They give a bucket of ice which really dulls down the taste of the alcohol and increases the fruity hints which is nice. Definitely something good to try for a special occasion. 10/10

The premium set which is definitely worth it since you get to try a bit of everything. Everything from that set I enjoyed. Obviously especially the wagyu beef which is what you should try if you are to come to Zakkushi. 10/10 for that set and would recommend and come back to get. 

The tskune (chicken meat ball) was nice a juicy and bigger than I would have expected. 10/10 

The mentai carbonara udon is delicious. Very flavourful and I would definitely get it again. 10/10 

The umeshiso yaki was alright in my opinion and I probably wouldn't get it again. Though it says in the description that it is chicken thigh it was a bit dry and tasted more like chicken breast to me. The sour plum is probably more of an acquired taste so it depends on the person. 6/10 

The oporon ponzu was good but compared to the wagyu beef and just beef from other places, it wasn't that special. 7/10 

The yakioni was okay. The outer layer was too crispy for me. It's like getting Korean stone pots and at the bottom you get the rice that's very hard. 6/10

The natto bakudan is definitely an acquired taste. It doesn't really taste like much but the after taste has kinda like a cheesy taste. I'm personally not a big fan but I don't really have anything to compare it to so I'll leave my review at that. 

The kinako mochi ice cream was nice. The only special thing about it though is the mochi is was nice and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The ice cream part of it was mediocre. 8/10 

The dorayaki matcha ice cream was good but again nothing unique about it. The outside part (dorayaki) was nice and fluffy though. 8/10"}
{"text":"LOUD!

Random screaming of something or other going on constantly... I wasn't sure if they were yelling out orders but there was a response that was yelled back in unison by many.

Line up waiting for it to open at 530pm?  Yes... a line up like that soup place in Seattle at Pike Place.  There's a pub next door that has a spinning sign makes the most irritating noise on the planet.  That noise could be used for sensory torture for such applications as renditions in top secret places.

Once you get inside immediately we were immersed into the entire theme of yelling and ritual of whatever routine this place is made up of.  It's fun but it can be a bit annoying when you're trying to have a conversation with somebody directly across from you but you can't really because it's so freaking loud inside.  It's loud just keep that in mind.  This isn't a modest place and it appears they don't want to be.  Their volume and decibel level is part of the experience and you have to understand that this is what you will get if you choose to dine here.

As far as the menu goes most everything has photos so you have an idea.  There is a bit of a mixed jumble but it's half organized enough to understand.  At another yakitori place I noticed that they will consolidate all sets in waves so if you ordered 5 sets of the regular you will get all the chicken at once or all the beef at once etc.  They don't give you 5 sets with 5 different sticks on one plate each... no you have to remember what you ordered and keep in mind your stick of that plate is on that etc.  

For the premium sets it seemed a bit more organized.  My table (of 3 tables) had 2 premium sets and they had all 10 of our sticks on 2 plates, 3 pairs on one and 2 pairs on another.  It was nice to get it all at the same time.  Also you knew it was the premium set because the sticks had a little bit of a flat handle at the base...

Good?  The food is good and the premium meat tasted even better.  I ended up getting an extra salmon, eel and bowl of rice on the side.  

We were a large party of 10 so we basically occupied 3 tables along the wall on the side of the bar.  The all wood decor and tightness makes you feel cramped so if you're claustrophobic perhaps this place isn't for you?  

Overall the food just kept on coming in waves, the place was very loud and the food was better than decent.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"I'll make this quick. I'm not going to tear it apart but honestly our meal was pretty underwhelming. I had a few good yakitori skewers but at least 2 dishes that were really unpleasant...scallops that were not cleaned or fresh, and a bowl of soup that tasted a little like fishy dishwater. I also found the prices to generally be a little too high.

Great service though, they are really friendly!"}
{"text":"This place reminds of Kazu, an izakaya in Montreal: it's crowded, has wooden decor/feel, and serves tapas style food essentially.

We basically ordered only the \"weird\" (ha, I know, what could possibly be weird food to Asians...we eat everything!) stuff! So for the yakitori we had: beef premium tongue (thicker cut), pork intestines, chicken liver, gizzards and this isn't skewers but the deep fried chicken knee cartilage with mayo.

Honestly all were pretty tasty, but my absolute favorite was the pork intestines. It was the most beautiful texture...crunchy and chewy with fantastic bbq sauce on it. Oh sidebar, my boyfriend commented on how it tasted very similar to the chicken intestine skewers he had in the Philippines, which obviously they do not sell here in North America..most likely wouldn't be approved. Anyhow, loved all of it! The beef tongue was grand too. 

Service was fast in the beginning, which was when we came in around 5:30 (opening time), but as the evening progressed our skewers took longer to come to the table. Overall, superb experience. I recommend reserving ahead of time, this place gets seriously jammed. Also another tip is be aware that their prices are for EACH skewer, so don't get too yakitori happy...bill will add up!

Oh! And order a pork intestine yakitori for me!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, but I think we went about it all wrong and our dining experience compromised. 

But first, I love the decor in here. The hard word everything, and the meticulous flower petal art. I felt like I was Japan, not that I remember what that felt like, but it was all about the food after you walked in. 

Obviously, we compared it to Guu. I have to stay, their main specialty is the Yakatori skewers. Aside from that, a few of the fried dishes were tasty (chicken knees! takoyaki!) but it wasn't like Japanese snacks with a twist like Guu strives to do. This is purely authentic in that way. Some may not find it 'special' enough, but they do it well. 

Being the skeptical diners we are, what we SHOULD have done was order one skewer per person and not be too concerned about cost and things. You pay for each skewer (or order a set, but I found the selection better a la carte) - but each costs about $1.5-$2 each, unless you splurge on the Waygu beef ($6 each - but we found the $3 waygu meat ball more satisfying and shareable). 

What we did was order 2 or 3 and attempted to share this among 5 people. It became, small little chunks and bits, that left you un-sated. It would have been better to have each person have their own, and part of the fun was to eat it hot off the skewer anyhow. 

In terms of cost, we ordered quite a few dishes and landed at about $20 a person, but felt sort of anticlimatic.  There was room for more and we were well under budget. 

Aside from that, this is the rundown

Chicken Knees (NanKotsu) - Yum, must order, we got two of these perfect to share
Takoyaki - also very good. crispy on the outside, and a large chunk of octopus inside (also go 2)

Chicken Thighs - seems like one of their staples. Tasty.
Chicken Thights with Umeshiso sauce - interesting, but almost the same as the chicken thighs
Chicken Gizzard - yummy 
All of these were quite small

Beef and Garlic Beef - was tasty, also small compared to the photo
P-Toro - like a porkchop but fattier
Chicken Skin - YUM, I would have liked more if the group didn't like it

Fried Rice Ball with Shoyu sauce. Skip this. I wish it would have been thinner. This might have been good if it was considered a side dish with the rest of your meats, but it wasn't served this way

Kimchi Udon - tasty!!! Might even be better than the one at Guu

Desserts
The Tofu Almond is tasty, but not really that shareable
Favourite was the sticky rice with vanilla ice cream
Black Sesame was one, lacked the black sesame flavour.

None of the appetizers really stood out to us, although you can get a sampler for $5.80

I would give it an overall 3 or 3.5 stars, but +.5 BECAUSE THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS!

I would come back again if I was in the area, but don't know if I would make a trip back here. Maybe in a long while. 

What would be really nice is if they had specials!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, took some of my friends there last night and it was a hit! 

Ordered bunch of dishes to share, the best dishes were
- unagi (best I've had in Toronto, tender and juicy, grilled perfectly with just the right amount of Teriyaki sauce)
- grilled squid
- grilled mackerel: mackerel is my favourite fish and Zakkushi did not disappoint. I devoured that fish
- Donburi dishes were good, big enough to share
- cold monkfish liver: not a live person but decided to give it a try. Didn't taste or smell like liver and it was super smooth. Glad we ordered. came with 4 pieces, big enough to share. 

Small but cozy place. Would def. return."}
{"text":"Oh boy, oh boy!

Yes and Yes and YES! 

Bring on the Izakaya food coma! 

Being greeted with a line up of 20 plus people I was glad one of my friends had made a reservation. Less glad when it looked like we did not have one but once the misunderstanding was cleared we were seated. 

I love the feel of this restaurant; it is noisy but warm. Our server was very friendly and helpful.

I love attention to detail and thoughtful planning in a restaurant and so I bumped an extra star on there for the storage stools...no jackets/bags etc trailing on the ground in this place...no sirree! 

The eats...we had so much food...a disgusting amount of food! But the highlights for me included wasabi octopus salad with seaweed wrap...please forgive for forgetting the correct name; grilled wasabi chicken and beef; beef tongue; sashimi...the sashimi salmon was damn good! We had minced chicken skewers with garlic...those were tasty...oh and do try the pork wrapped asparagus tips! 

Grilled chillis were excellent too. 

Black sesame ice cream...delicious!  

There seemed to be a never ending stream of food and sake! 

All in all (between 7 of us) we were about $55 inc tax and tip (each)

Excellent value for good food!\"}
{"text":"The standby izakaya in toronto personally, there is a great variety on the menu, and basically everything is enjoyable. Request skewers with less salt or teriyaki as they can become quite salty otherwise, the other items on menu are not salty. They have oden, and the quality of sashimi is superb. Highly recommend wagyu beef and monkfish. Chicken hearts used to be good but has become quite chewy since they now slice the heart in half with the same grill time. Costs about 20-40/pp if you come for snacks and 90/pp if you come for dinner.

The ambience is very casual, but rather quiet for an izakaya so you can hear you dinner partners across the table without yelling.

It is located in a rather sketchy area so be aware of that when you park."}
{"text":"I think my obsession with Kinka Izakaya has ended upon my visit here.

While pricey, this little Japanese tapas bar serves up some splendid items that brings meaning to the saying of \"less is more\".

We ordered the carbonara udon and chicken knee cartilage karaage as hot dishes. For skewers,  we had the premium set of skewers, beef tongue, quail egg, cheese mocha maki and scallops.

The carbonara udon was pretty average and I've had better. However, there were so many other standout items. The chicken knee cartilage was crispy, crunchy and juicy all at once, and really made me look at karaage in a new light (if you have never tried it, you must)!

My favourite skewers were the wagyu beef, premium pork and quail egg, but all skewers were succulent and grilled to perfection!

My heart broke a little when the bill came but I don't think that will stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Zakkushi is my new love, my go-to place for authentic Japanese skewers!

It's originated in Vancouver.  Toronto is the fourth location.  I love the atmosphere and the vibe at this place.  Service is very friendly and attentive.  Staffs are also very polite.  They took the initiative of moving us to a bigger table after seeing us cramping ourselves with so many plates on the table.  Ladies can also put their bags and personal belongings under their seats (you can open the seat cover and put your things in, just don't forget to take them with you on the way out!)  Restrooms were tiny, but they've included all the amenities you'll ever need.

In my two visits, I've ordered the following so far:
- premium skewers set which includes wagyu beef
- chicken wings
- chicken thighs
- grilled squid
- beef tongue
- assorted sashimi platter
- quail eggs wrapped with pork
- tonshabu salad
- takoyaki
- okonomiyaki
- grilled spanish mackerel 
- yakitori don
- negi p-toro don
- mochi ice cream
- dorayaki macha ice cream

I love these the most:  the wagyu beef combo (very expensive, but quality was really good), chicken wings, grilled squid, beef tongue, grilled spanish mackerel, both yakitori don and negi p-toro don, and the mochi ice cream.  Some people might find their food a bit bland, but I personally prefer a more delicate taste, instead of going heavy on sauces.  

All the dishes tent to come at the same time, so if you don't want your dishes to clutter on your table and get cold before you eat them, make sure you order them in a few rounds.  We've made mistakes of ordering too much at once, and so the food became cold by the time we got to them. 

Both visits we've paid around $35-40 a person (incl. tax and tips) for dinner and everyone was full.

Yum yum, I'm still dreaming of the taste as I'm writing up this review!  I really wouldn't mind visiting there for the third time. :)"}
{"text":"So many... skewers. A bit expensive but they have some gems on the menu. Wagyu beef, lamb chop, chicken hearts and livers -- all great stuff. 

I loved the sea salt option over teriyaki. And oh my gosh, my favourites were the pork intestines and chicken livers. Try the monkfish liver if they have it on the menu still. I also recommend the assorted oden. We got a bottle of sake which was very easy to drink.

Great environment, lots of art in the place. They yell in Japanese when you come in and leave so you really feel the atmosphere from the start. Very up and about, noisy. A good time basically. There were actually a couple of birthdays when I went. They did the whole singing happy birthday thing and turning the lights dim.

Overall, top tier izakaya. Loved it."}
{"text":"Zakkushi is 1 of 2 of my favourite places to eat in downtown Toronto. I could tell you why, but why spoil it? Just go - Trusttttt."}
{"text":"I don't remember every single one I ordered but everything here is soooo good and worth a try! Love the beef tongue and unagi! The season special soba noodle with duck breast is also really savoury.
The servers are really nice too. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great food here! The food came out piping hot just like how yakitori should be and the waiters are always friendly and mindful. When our beer/soda was finished they came by and asked if we wanted refills, when we said no, they came back with water. How considerate is that for a busy restaurant!

Their Annin tofu was just what i need to finish off my meal...it was not too sweet, full of almond flavor and very silky smooth!

Would definitely come back here for more!

I did find their \"salt\" flavor to be a tad too salty, I will try their teriyaki flavor next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Zakkushi many times over the last few years and have always enjoyed the food. It is a great place for groups as you can share food and grab drinks at the same time (although the bill does easily add up). I appreciate that they like to switch up their menu every so often - they don't make drastic changes, but rather, come up with new variations of dishes so you don't get bored but also don't miss out on some of your favorite ingredients. They are known for their skewers, but all their food is quite delicious. I like to order a mix of skewered and appetizers + hot and cold tapas. On this particular day, my boyfriend and I ordered:

Appetizer sampler: takowasabi, kawahagi, ankimo - takowasabi and ankimo were good, but wasn't the biggest fan of the kawahagi (dried filefish) as it was too chewy, but not in a good way like dried puffer fish.

Yakitori: shiitake, eringi, zucchini, tomato, giant scallop - all very well flavored. Bf ordered a lot of the meat skewers but I can't speak for it as I don't eat meat. He seemed to enjoy it and made a few repeat orders on the pork skewers though. 

Cold tapas: natto bukadan - natto (fermented soybeans) is not for everyone but I have an acquired taste for it + it comes with a soft boiled egg so it was delicious to me

Hot tapas: baby octopus - I usually go for the calamari but decided to be adventurous this time; I prefer the calamari 
Grilled cod - usually a big fan of cod but this was a bit too greasy and pricey, so I would do without it next time

Annin tofu - don't usually eat dessert after meals but this almond tofu was too good to pass up!

I've always made sure to make reservations well ahead of time, but this particular visit was on a whim so we ended up waiting around 40 mins. Lesson learned: don't bother coming without reservations. 

Also, don't wear your fancy clothes because in keeping up with the authenticity of Japanese Yakitori restaurants, the place smells like grease. Prepare to shower after."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's fun, tasty and affordable.  It can be a little loud sometimes, but still a great place to eat and socialize."}
{"text":"It's an Izakaya with a focus on skewers. The prices are good and there's a decent amount of interesting choices in addition to what you would normally expect.  In addition to skewers, the grilled squid and chicken cartilage dishes are fantastic. Beer's not overly expensive either. Finally, a few months ago a drink featuring a Popsicle was offered which was really great.  it was recently taken off the menu because of a freezer-door-left-open accident. If it's offered, I'd give it a shot."}

{"text":"Toronto is going through an izakaya craze right now; who knew that Japanese tapas would be so popular. Anyway, I had dinner here on Saturday night with my mother. Reservations can be made; however, you have to call as online reservation making is not an option. We arrived at 5:30 (opening) and it was quite empty, but within 20 minutes, the place was packed. Unlike another izakaya in the city, we were able to carry a conversation without screaming. I like the decor and feel of this place; it looks like an izakaya you'd find in Japan. The menu is extensive and includes oden along with a number of unique yakitori. We ordered a number of items, including wagyu yakitori, sweet potato fries, spinach/mushroom/garlic, BBQ donburi, and mochi/kinako ice cream. The food was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, my experience (including the food) was a-ok.

Good for: Japanese, tapas"}
{"text":"My Fave place to go to for skewers, this style is called yakatori. My favourite skewers are: shoyu- koji (chicken meatball with soy and mayo), chicken thigh with cheese (melts in your mouth), norimayo tsukune (chicken meatball with seaweed and mayo), bbq beef, bacon asparagus and lastly giant scallops ! Real hit for small groups and definitely a new experience.  I wouldn't recommend any of the other cold dishes, nothing special. I would recommend reserving as it gets really busy on weekends and Friday nights. Most of the customers are based on reservations. I was surprised when I walked in around 545 and still had to wait almost an hour.. either way I Always come back at least 3 times a year!"}
{"text":"I first tried Zakkushi when I was in Vancouver for the very first time. I didn't know that there was a location in Toronto until recently. I have to say, I think I enjoyed the Vancouver location more, but this location is just as good. This place is great to come with friends. The food is in tapas style, where there is a lot of skewers to choose from. However, you should be careful when ordering as you can order a lot of items very quickly and it can get very pricey by the end of your night."}
{"text":"Charming decor, and quick, efficient service. Atmosphere wise, I really enjoyed how the music wasn't overwhelmingly loud (I'm looking at you, Guu). They have a nice patio on the lower level of the restaurant which is below ground level; I really liked that aspect (no traffic disturbance), so I would probably request to sit there next time. 

Food: 

Pretty good, pretty damn pricey. Everything on the main menu is charged PER SKEWER: the bf and I didn't realize this (despite it being written on the menu, whoops) until the end of our meal. Although delicious, the most expensive item we tried was the eel skewer - one skewer (2 pieces) was about $6.50 (holy mother of..)! The \"premium set\" ($19.80) was also super expensive imo; 5 skewers of varying meats: chicken, pork, meatballs, beef tongue, and wagyu beef. I understand that we're paying a premium mostly for the wagyu, but almost $20 for 5 tiny skewers is a bit much. 

Food standout: We really enjoyed the fried octopus; it was fried nicely, was tender, and came with an A+ dipping sauce. The mochi ice cream (4 pieces of mochi, scoop of vanilla, maple syrup) was also excellent. 

Bottom line: don't come on an empty stomach expecting to leave full. I won't be a regular, but this place is good for reasonably priced beer (Sapporo pitchers are currently $10) and a few small snacks (oh yeah, portion sizes are smalllllllllll af)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had recommended this place for date night and we made the mistake of not making a reservation on the weekend! We waited for about an hour before getting seated, but it was definitely worth it. We ordered a lot of skewers and dishes and everything came fairly on time. Overall, we were very satisfied, friendly service, good prices and delicious noms. 

An excellent place to splurge once in a while!"}
{"text":"Was craving asian food so I ended up here and all the expensive meat we ordered were over cooked and I had to send back my intestines to be re-cooked to well done. On the other hand, their sashimi salad was the best item....at a yakitori house.

Similar pricing to guu sakabar and that place was ten folds better than here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant will be compared to Guu Izakaya for it's similar approach to Japanese food. Having been to both Guus many times, I was excited to find an alternative that appeared to be more affordable than Guu - plus the menu seemed really exciting.

We went to this restaurant on a Sunday night and ordered lots of small dishes. Emphasis on word small as they were really tiny. We ended up ordering so many dishes that the bill got as high as when we dine at Guu. Which would be fine if the food was as good as at Guu, but this was not the case. Admittedly, the sashimi that came with the drink combo was one of the best I've ever had. The rest of the dishes ranged from rather good to ok. The baby squid appetizer was truly disgusting and it took many sips of Sapporo to get the taste from my mouth.

Bottom line is, the value for the money is simply not there. Other than the sashimi the food was average and forgettable and I will be saving my Izakaya dining budget for Guu."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite spot downtown for Yakitori and beer. Friendly staff, service is always great. I never have trouble getting a spot when my boyfriend and I go, however I do recommend making a reservation if it's a group of 6+. I had a great time celebrating my birthday in the summer on their patio. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for Japanese skewers.  However if you come on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  There is not a lot of seating.  

There wasn't really something I would not recommend, things on the menu is worth a try.  The one must have item I would say is the matcha green tea ice cream pancake."}
{"text":"Service: terrible 
Food: average 
Atmosphere: hot and stuffy 

Came here with my friends on a Saturday night. Made my reservation for 7pm and was advised that there is a seating limit of 2 hours (very normal for a weekend). By 8:30pm, we were still waiting for the rest of our food to come, the Manager came and ask us to move to the table right infront go the grill as they have a party of 12. In another word, she wants to kick us out. There was only 30 minutes left till the seating limit is up and she still wants us to move. If they knew that there was a party of 12 coming, then they should have organize the seating arrangement ahead of time and not telling your customers to move in the middle of their dinner to compensate for their disorganization. I have never been to a restaurant and was told to move in the middle of the dinner. I find that extremely rude and was not please with the manager's manner. 

I will not be returning to this restaurant and will not recommend this place to anyone, there are many other izayaka in Toronto that are so much better than this place."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time in 4-5 months and was surprised to see they open til 2am now (or at least I didn't know that they did if they always were like that). Seems to be the only Japanese bar/izakaya in Toronto to stay open that late so bonus points for me.

This is a great place for drinking and eating with friends. Loud and crowded but it's all part of the experience. 

The food is always great. Love the wagyu beef and nama harumaki (Japanese style fresh spring roll with tuna and avocado). 

Drink selection is always interesting. Tried a Ramune sour last night and loved it - essentially a spiked Ramune.

A bit out of the way from the rest of dt and the subway lines but still very well worth the trek."}
{"text":"Always a fun place to go to although seating is a bit limited.  But it's cozy and the atmosphere is spot on.  The food is good and tasty.  I love organ meats and they do it really nicely here."}
{"text":"Great ambiance upstairs with a Japanese vintage izakaya look and feel. Downstairs atmosphere is a bit lacking, but still clean.

I will try to reserve the upstairs dining area next time.

Walked in with no reservations on a Saturday night. We ended up waiting for ~40mins, but that's expected - just look at the other reviews!

Skewers came quickly.
The carbonara mentai udon was really good, better than guu's version. Pork on rice was meh.
Skewers overall were good and at good value. Not overpriced. I liked the giant scallop skewers and the pork-wrapped garlic skewers.

Something I didn't like: I didn't like the shiitake mushroom skewers though. It tasted sour but it could have been the sauce they used. May have been a combination of ponzu, etc. 

Something I overlooked: we ordered the skewer sets and then ordered some individual skewers, only to realize later that some of the individual skewers were redundant because they already came in the set. Lesson learned.

Will return."}
{"text":"Been there once, first time and last time.  My pocket is too shallow for this restaurant.   Service was good, food came fast, some food was good, some food was just okay.  3 pieces of mini meat for 6 dollars. Oh yeah, my pocket is too shallow for this restaurant. Left with a hungry stomach. Our bill was 316 for 3 ppl."}
{"text":"Their standard maintains and it is always a very enjoyable trip out to Zakkushi.  The food and the selection of sake is phenomenal.  However, they are so fully booked that our group felt rushed and was told that it was the \"last call\" long before we promised to return the table.  It was not very pleasant.  I don't mind being told that they were fully booked that evening and not taking any walk ins. But I do mind being rushed and hustled.  Not pleasant."}
{"text":"Another small Japanese BBQ place that's hidden away on the East end of Toronto. If you're looking for a place to hang out with friends with some small appetizers and some beer this is the place to be. The food was fantastic, with the food being grilled on an open flamed charcoal grill you get some authentic flavors. Personal favorites for the night were the chicken thigh skewers and the chicken hearts, if you're looking for some more substantial the calamari, yaki soba and fried chicken were a delicious and a must try.

The only problem you'll run into is that since the portion sizes are small (Prices are listed as per skewer) its easy to get carried away and rack up a high bill if you're not careful. If you're looking for a place to eat a full dinner, I'd recommending going somewhere else. This place is great but isn't really meant for a full meal in my opinion.

It should be noted that most of the staff members don't speak english very well, so you'll need to be patient with them as they take your order."}
{"text":"Love this place! Servers were nice and efficient. And the food is amaazzing!! I'd say they make some of the best yakitori places in Toronto! Cooked items such as mentaiko udon, chicken wings and takoyaki balls are delicious as well. The only food items that tasted just okay were the desserts, but I can live with that. Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service. Had server who kept rushing us to order then leave. Other servers seemed unlike her so it's probably not a restaurant problem but just this one person. Would give 4 stars if not for her."}
{"text":"The most delicious place I have had in ages... this is crazy!!  Sooo goood... melts in your mouth  fish liver... beautiful and. Super fresh sashimi.... you gotta come here boys & girls!!!  

4** is an understatement...seriously.. made me feel like I was in Japan. Hokkaido baby!! Everything was seasoned perfectly to the dot,  we also got the Sapporo for only $9.99 which was awesome @  pure love..

We just kept on eating non stop... this is the way to eat Japanese food...this is the way to go!  The food, the freshnesa and the zakkushi set was all well worth every dollar of mine...

I'm in loveee...  with this restaurant... gotta come back here in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I don't know why people gave this place $$$.  I give it a $$.  It's a lot cheaper than Izakayas.  I suggest ordering their assorted yakatori sticks.  The kimchi udon is to die for.  I'm a fan of cheese but I found it overwhelming on the yakatori.  The ricecake & ice cream dessert is a must.  I will go back again and again just because the food and service is great.  Plus again the prices are not THAT bad.  Only downfall I find is the prices of the beers....but I find with all Japanese establishments, their Saporro and Asahi is expensive.  Espcecially Asahi because it's imported."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and this was one of the places my friend recommended. We tried many items on the menu and some of my favorites were the beef tongue, the wagyu beef, fried chicken cartilage and the udon. Service was good and the waitress was super friendly. The price was great considering how much we ate. I would highly recommend this place and I definitely wish we had such high quality yakitori in nyc at such great prices!"}
{"text":"I just waited 45 mins past my reservation time because of poor management. 

Then the guy asks me to sit at the bar. But no one is sitting at the bar. 

Honestly the amount of trouble to come to this place, the amount of my time wasted aimlessly waiting vs. the actual food's worth renders this place not worth it. 

The skewers taste smokey. Thats about it. Good luck even if you make reservations."}
{"text":"My favorite Izakaya in Toronto! The vibes are happy and staff are energetic without shouting at the top of their lungs. They always have great seasonal menus, like Sakura-themed items for spring. You can sit in cute booths and if it's your birthday they will do a song and dance for you (literally).

The best things here are the skewers of course. I always order the quail eggs, cheese mochi, and beef. Their yakitori don (grilled chicken with rice) and karaage are also group favourites. Everything is so good, you can't go wrong here, just order to your heart's content.

Remember to make a reservation, they're super popular."}
{"text":"Great place! Authentic Japanese food. Small portions tapas style. Delicious octopus balls! Amazing tuna sashimi and all other seafood dishes."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it didn't make my wallet bleed and me weeping in tears every time I get the bill. To say that this place is expensive is an understatement. It's so pricey it makes caviar on a bed of truffles seem like a steal! Ok.. that's a bit of a stretch but it's pricey nonetheless.
I love their food. Just about everything tastes amazingly good and it almost makes you forget that every bite you take is costing $5. So go ahead and order anything on the menu knowing confidently that it will probably taste great. Just be frugal though if you want to leave this place without having to re-mortgage your house.
I think the best tip I can offer would be to pre-eat (LOL) before your visit but it's definitely a place worth revisiting."}
{"text":"This place was extremely friendly and welcoming! First walked in and was screamed \"WELCOME!\" in Japanese by everyone that worked here. It's great seeing more authentic Japanese restaurants run by the Japanese lately.

Inside was fairly medium-sized, I thought it would be much larger but the restaurant size ain't that bad. The decor was cute and very Japanese-like, with the wooden-like furniture and the lighting was dim-lit but enough to see our food and to enjoy it.

Food here is absolutely fantastic! Ordered a bunch of skewers, takoyakis, okomiyaki and some delicious salmon sashimi.

First off, the wagyu beef skewer is the best thing EVER! Seriously, it's like juicy to the max! Paired up with the shredded daikon radish w/ a little bit of ponzu, absolutely delicious. The ultimate duo, for reals. All the skewers were delicious but avoid ordering the \"Scallops\" skewer. My friend ordered it because it looked good in the picture but it wasn't as yummy as we thought it would be and I would rather spend that $2.9 on another skewer or dish.

Now onto the Cheese Mochi Maki...holy mackerel, you were absolutely DELICIOUS! Melted cheese on top of pork that was sandwiched with mochi? Mmmm, goody goody goodness. It tasted like a Japanese style melted cheese, but instead of bread, you've got chewy mochi goodness as your substitute. This is definitely a must try!!

The takoyaki balls were delicious. It was on the same level as Guu's and I enjoyed it very much! On the other hand, the okonomiyaki wasn't as good. It was tasteless and it didn't really taste like an okonomiyaki should. So avoid ordering that as well.

For appetizers, definitely get the Kawahiga. The flavour of the dried fish with the mayo is yum yum yum. It's tasty, subtle and also chewy, making it a great way to start off your night or to eat in between each skewers.

The salmon sashimi was amazing! It was incredibly fresh and tasty, it melted in my mouth and their beer was great too! Light and super refreshing!

Overall, great food, great beer and a great time. A nice place to kick back with some friends and enjoy a good night out. It was expensive but worth every penny. I will definitely be back to try more of their stuff!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite robatayaki places in Toronto! 
I ordered mostly meat-skewers but the one that stood out the most was the tsukune (chicken meatball) set - the norimayo and cheese sauce were my favourite :P
I would also recommend the shoyo onigiri (soy sauce on rice ball) and the Oropon Hamachi (yellow tail with daikon and ponzu sauce). I'm getting hungry just typing this up..

I'm usually a fan of takowasabi but I thought they added too much wasabi sauce onto it - it actually made me tear up haha! :*D

I'd recommend Zakkushi to anyone who enjoys lively environment, although it's a little crowded. Our server was very friendly. I'd definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"We waited a very long time just to get a table and service. It was over an hour.

They seated us downstairs. It looked completely different. Not like a izakaya. No dark natural wood setting. But it was very quiet.

The first thing we noticed was that the table was sticky and felt dirty. The service took a while.

We ordered 5 things: the skewers sets, squid, eel, a rice fish and udon soup bowl. Everything was small and bite sized as expected. The udon was in a decently sized bowl. 

None of the dishes were memorably delicious. Felt like we could've made it ourselves. I'm not sure if I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"I skip the premium selections as I like the second grade just as tasty. Love the liver, tongue, and chicken. But I'm also into strange stuff."}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic yakitori joint you can find in Toronto! Zakkushi cooks the skewers in charcoal, and you can see it happen past the glass. 

I loved the combo with five of their recommended skewers, including chicken, pork, and beef. My favourite was the chicken gizzard which has a rather crunchy texture for meat. The premium
Beef tongue was also amazingly fatty and juicy! 

I would come back to try their premium skewers! Note that the bill can add up quickly as a skewer costs from 2-3$ and premium skewers can range from 4$+. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated and has an Izakaya vibe. Friendly and welcoming service as well!"}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed by the food here. Although the concept of the entire restaurant was great, the execution was poor. Most of the things we got were only lukewarm and felt like it had been prepared a while ago, but was just being warmed until it was served. I've been to other Izakaya places and never got that feeling - dishes are prepared on the spot as it should be. The only few highlights were the Mentai Carbonara Udon (cod roe and creamy sauce) and the Agé Mochi (deep fried sticky rice). The yakitori (we got the Zakkushi set), which is supposed to be their specialty was only okay... very over salted in my opinion. Everything was also overpriced and I didn't really feel like I was getting my money's worth. Overall, it wouldn't hurt to skip trying out this place."}
{"text":"Highly enjoyable spot with an authentic Japanese vibe - food, service and decor all reminded me of my years in Tokyo.  Unfortunately, the price did too - not crazy, but certainly not cheap.  

The karaage (deep fried chicken) was the nicest I've had outside of Japan, but the real highlight was the service - charming and authentic from everyone.  

If you go on a Monday, you can order the sushi from downstairs as well."}
{"text":"No doubt one of the best izakayas in town. This is the only restaurant that specializes in Japanese skewers. Although other restaurants also offer skewers, the quality of skewers made here are way above others. Staff are generally friendly. Prices of beer/Japanese sake are similar to other places on the market.

Their Oden is also very good, as well as small tapa dishes like squid or saba. One downside: the bill can get expensive pretty quickly since portions are all quite small.

Would like to see Zakkushi expand their menu and add more items to the skewer's list in the future!"}
{"text":"Loved everything!  The environment is very lively, friendly, and welcoming.  Every staff member greets u on ur way in.  The skewers are awesome.  My favorite are their appetizer & drink combos!  Great deals!  At $9.99 u cannot go wrong.  There are beer, sake, and shochu combos. Love it.  Sashimi is fresh.  No complaints.  Excellent food, service, environment!"}
{"text":"We were seated in the basement corner, after waiting an hour, when this weird stench made its way across the table and I began to think OH GOD WE HAVE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. 

Despite the pizza we ordered and devoured in waiting for a table to open up at Zakkushi, we proceeded to order,I would say, around 73.459% of the menu items available and a pitcher of Sapporo. 

The food was great. SO TASTY, freshly prepared, great value for money, and there was a plethora of options you can choose from--a nightmare for indecisive people but a haven for picky eaters! I ate a good chunk of the menu and almost everything was a hit! Order the wagyu beef, the pork with garlic stubs, and the chicken thighs. Skip the yakioni and dessert. 

Despite the weird beginning I would come back to this place in a heartbeat. Would even redo the whole eat-a-pizza-while-waiting thing at Salt and Tobacco (also so good!). Come here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Not the best bbq I ever had, but a solid 5/5.
I recommend:
Wagyu beef, wagyu beef balls, regular bbq beef, pork with garlic shoots/asparagus.

Warning: EXTREMELY loud. Also, I recommend you make reservations as it can be really hard to get a walk-in table."}
{"text":"Service is fine. But food came dish by dish and cold . Beer became hot when the food arrives.Took 1 hour for all food order to come. 

Gave us watered down calpico water with only about 1/3 Calpico and 2/3 water & ice."}
{"text":"I honestly gasped when I was wandering around Carlton & Parliament and saw a 'Zakkushi Opening Soon' sign.  One of my favourites drink & snack joints in Vancouver (the original Denman location, to be exact) - now in Toronto.  I was pretty happy to say the least.  After waiting a month or so after their opening and waiting for them to get their liquor license, I finally paid Zakkushi in Toronto a visit.

It's yet another Vancouver import -- but unlike Guu or Kingyo, the menu on Zakkushi focuses on skewered meat grilled over charcoal and it's closer to an actual Japanese izakaya.  Most of the items on the menu are around $2 - $4 / skewer and they serve everything from your boring white meat chicken yakitori to beef tongue to chicken gizzard, hearts and liver.  If you haven't discovered the joys of beautifully grilled animal offal on a stick, you may not like this place.  Of course, they also offer other things like sashimi, salads, deep-fried tapas and some udon dishes - but you're probably better off going to Guu / Kingyo for that.  You have to remember that this place is named Zakkushi -- and 'kushiyaki' means 'grilled skewer'.

I say this place is a legit izakaya because it doesn't get anymore 'hard drinking salaryman' than slamming down shochu and beer and noshing on salty, greasy grilled meat.  I mean, I noticed a family with a couple kids in tow eating noodles -- which is fine, I suppose -- but this place has never been a 'meal' place for me.  It's food to accompany drinking - not the other way around.

Pricing *really* varies here - I mean, they have a combo deal for $10 where you get a pint of Sapporo, tuna sashimi, salad appetizer and edamame.  This is damned good value (even for the tapa portions).  Sapporo pitchers are $17 and 1L mega pints are $9.50 - so drink pricing is reasonable.  But, if you're not careful and perhaps get too drunk, the small skewers at $2 - $4 a pop will creep up on you.  They have a bamboo cup at every table when you put your used skewers - my friends and I used to drink, bullshit and fill the cup up completely with narrow discarded skewers.  We credit card roulette for the bill and the loser usually ended up paying about $600 for 4 guys - life is good when you can spend the equivalent of two PS3s on purely beer and skewers.

It may seem expensive because $12 will get you an entree at many places, but maybe 3 - 6 skewers at Zakkushi that aren't very filling - however, unlike lame kushiyaki joints, they don't force minimum orders.  You can literally order *one* of every skewer on the menu and watch the cook carefully season and grill each skewer (which all demand different cooking times) over the charcoal by eye.  Considering the effort and you can sample everything made to order, the prices are totally reasonable.  Hell, you can reconstruct a whole chicken in your belly if you order all the chicken skewers.

So ya, this Zakkushi is very much like it's original Vancouver locations.  The place is much larger, has fancier decor and service is better.  However, it's not quite as fun as the original Zakkushi on Denman which is crammed, the servers are aloof and you are likely to have a drunk bump into you as you try to carefully eat meat off a sharp, pointy stick.

Also, I really don't understand why they played that shitty Euro house music in the background.  Guu, Hapa and Zakkushi never had music in Vancouver - have no idea why all three added shitty ambient music in Toronto.  I just want to eat and have the din of the crowd drown out my boorish, drunken yelling -- I don't want to feel like I'm shopping at a mall.

But I'm going to give it 4-stars anyways just because I'm happy one of my favourite haunts back home is opened in Toronto.  I gave the Denman location 4-stars as well - but that was because it was just short of perfect -- Carlton Zakkushi gets a 'well-only-because-I-know-your-brother' 4."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday on recommendation from my foodie friend. Similar style to Guu, but I liked how the tables are sectioned off so it has a more intimate feel than Guu, where you're sitting on benches to the party next to you. Our waiter gave us amazing recommendations. Sorry I usually write more elaborate reviews with names of food to try, but I'm writing this a week later. You can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu though. I will definitely be back! You should make a reservation though because you won't get a table if you walk in. They also do a 2 hr limit on the table so don't be late!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here with my mom. We stopped by 6pm on Saturday and didn't make a reservation, but luckily they fit us in without waiting too long in line. The food was great and the price was fair."}
{"text":"This place is very busy and loud. I have to say that I am not a big fan of all the yelling from the staff when people walk in or order stuff...I just don't see the point. I feel bad for the employees for having to do that ridiculous \"show\" that actually annoyed the crap of most people. We were a table of 4 and ordered a lot of different dishes. All dishes were great but are very small. This place is not meant for you to have a full dinner. If you come here hungry, your bill will rack up pretty fast as each order is only snack size and priced per skewer. Overall, the food was good, but places like this is just not worth it for me."}
{"text":"I just finished a meal here and I have to say the food definitely exceeded my expectations.

However, the service at this place was beyond sub-par. After trying the Wagyu beef skewers, (which were excellent by the way) we decided to ask the server for two more orders. These orders did not arrive after 30 minutes so my girlfriend and I decided to order desserts as well, thinking that the Wagyu would be served before the desserts were served. The desserts came first however so I cancelled the order for the Wagyu skewers. When I asked for the bill, the male server who I will not name and was working during the  6-7pm period looked at it for a whole minute then questioned me on whether I had eaten the skewers that were not served. 

Instead of receiving an apology for the food I ordered that did not arrive after a 30-minute wait, I was accused of being dishonest. I have never been humiliated like this in any restaurant or any aspect of my life for that matter. I hope management addresses this because it is a shame that the service at this place does not even come close to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Bleh. The best thing was basically the service. Some of the items were flavoured very weird. The lamb was superb quality. Everything else was like above average but couldn't justify the prices for every single thing. The chicken heart sucked. Don't order the samplers for skewers. VERY BASIC and it did not taste that great. Just order the lamb and pork belly. I will probably be back because the lamb and pork is awesome and I want to try their carbs. Udon carbonara looked promising. But seriously the service was awesome.. Maybe I am just being biased cause I hated the skewer samplers. The salads weren't 100% amazing either. Aspects of it were good but not the whole thing. I probably expected too much because my friend put it on such a high pedestal. I would have preferred Harbin."}
{"text":"I'm Coming Back!

My dad and I ventured this place last night and I had a terrific time. I wasn't aware that this place existed at all - shame on me.

What did we have? (more like, what didn't we have!)
- Takowasabi (Octopus mixed w/ wasabi stems)
- Kuragé (Jelly Fish w/ imitation shark fin in sesame oil sauce)
- Kushi (Premium Set): Wagyu Beef / Duck Breast / Free Range Chicken Momo /  Premium Beef Tongue
- Lamb Chop
- Unagi (Eel)
- Sashimi Platter
- Chicken Karaagé
- Horenso Ninniku Foil Yaki (king oyster mushrooms, spinach, garlic, wrapped & grilled in foil w/ soy sauce & butter)

My FAVOURITE items have to be:
- Takowasabi (great starter)
- Chicken Karaagé also good to start with 
- Kuragé (one of their new menu items, very similar to a Chinese appetizer )
- Wagyu Beef
- Free Range Chicken Momo
- Premium Beef Tongue

The remainder were good, but i was a little underwhelmed by the Horenso Ninniku Foil Yaki. I was expecting larger pieces of mushroom and/or deeper flavour - neither of which I took away from that dish.

We paired all of this with hot sake and tea to finish.

The atmosphere is quite something. Lots of cheering, yelling across the restaurant, and energy in general.

Little secret - if you're sitting on a chair without a back - in all likeliness, your seat cover lifts up to expose a spot for you to store your coat (especially useful in the winter time!)"}
{"text":"After a night on the town, I was expecting to to go home and chill - but the BF was feeling the little nibbles vs the big nibbles, this means that we don't stop for a street sausage/hot dog or getting a stuffed $12 burrito nor were we feeling the greasy spoon late night Chinese diner standard dishes either. 

Seeing that it was almost midnight and here isn't much else open beyond what was mentioned about -  we were struggling to find a suitable alternative, luckily he remembered Zakkushi, which came recommended by a cousin of his. 

Happily for us - this place closes late 2 am on a Saturday! So perfect for our needs.

Ordering is fairly straight forward; since we stuck to the easy stuff like 1 Zakkushi set and a mochi with bacon skewer and one oyster mushroom special skewer. Overall assessment - loved the zakkushi set, split decision on the mochi with bacon and so-so on the oyster mushroom special. 

Fast forward to a few weeks later - we went with a larger group of people - so we got to try more food this time around. Because we went at a \"peak\" time - they really do limit you to 2 hrs and last call is an 1/2hr before end seating time. 

Favorites - Takowasabi, the deboned chicken wing; mi-maki, almond tofu, and the chicken thigh with sour plum sauce; 

I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped mochi and the Yaki onigiri. But others in my party weren't that crazy about these ones. 

Dessert - I say skip the chiffon cake and get the cute and fun presented almond tofu, which is a bit hard to share. Also get the mochi and ice cream dessert dish. There is also the dorayaki, which I wasn't too enthused about. 

Pricing - it can get expensive, since pricing is per skewer, with the exception of the special Sets. With my party 1 it worked out to be about $40 per couple including cocktails for the ladies and a pitcher of beer for the gents. 

Neat features 
hot towel service when you get in.  
Summer feature from Sunday to Thursday - beer pitchers are $10"}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone is talking about, this is probably the worst kushi place I've ever been to in my life.  As a Japanese, for it to be a Japanese owned and operated is kind of unbelievable and really embarrassing. 

All skewers were all way too salty.  The wagyu was a joke, even somewhat chewy.  Ordered various beef, chicken, pork, lamb.  All too salty.  Poor grilling skill, poor quality.  Would never give this place another chance based on the shitty quality of the kushi here.  $7+ lamb chop was almost completely raw.  Absurd.

I wanted to like this place despite the food, but it is all around a bad experience.  Seating downstairs is uncomfortable.  No air circulating in a dank basement.  Awful.   Service also pretty bad.  Appetizers served way before drink arrives.  Ordered a nigori plum wine.  Apparently they were sold out of that as they just took it upon themselves to bring me some other completely different plum wine and not say anything.  Sent it back.  Stupid low level place."}
{"text":"Finally, a Yakitori joint in Downtown.
Most of the food items were delicious at this place. The lack of a liquor license is a big bummer as most of the food goes so well with a cold beer.
Menu review:
App:
Shiokara - Be warned, this item is an acquired taste.  Unless you've had this before I highly doubt most people will enjoy it.(Salty fermented Squid)
Kawahagi - This is so good, and it goes so well with beer.  Texture is somewhat like dried cuttlefish but the flavor is amazing.
Yakitori:
Premium Beef Tongue - didn't think this is worth the money
Momo/Mentai Yaki/Umeshiso Yaki(different variation of chicken thigh):  It's okay, nothing special
Teba(chicken wing)/Gizzard:  This is very good, it's a must try. 
 They were out of chicken skin that night =(
P-Toro/Me Maki Aspara Maki: Quite tasty. I would order this again.
*Overall the chicken and pork yakitoris were a lot better than the beef yakitori imo.
Yakioni(Grill Rice Ball) with Butter Shoyu - AMAZING!! MUST TRY.
Deep Fried Food
Amaebi Karaage - It's okay, nothing special
Nankotsu (Deep Fried Chicken knee cartilage):  Done perfectly."}
{"text":"At the price they were charging, the food wasn't up to par - with the exception of few.
Atmosphere, authenticity, accommodation, and service was fantastic though!"}
{"text":"For the higher price, I was assuming it would have mind-blowingly delicious food. Sadly, the dishes were a bit of a hit or a miss.

Staff: They were very pleasant and were quite helpful. I did notice that once we slowed down on our food orders, it was more difficult to get their attention. Some foods came very fast, however there were a few dishes that were very delayed (we ordered a couple dishes during our initial order but it didn't arrive until after the second wave of orders).

Ambience: It has a dark rich wooden seating and dimmer lighting. While I love the feel of it, I did find it uncomfortable after being seated for a whole meal. A plus is that you can hang your jackets or store them under the box seats.

Food: You're ordering small dishes for food, so the bill can rack up quite easily. The Norimayo Tsukune (chicken meal with teriyaki sauce and mayo) was mighty delicious, the meat just melted right off. The Wagyu Beef Tsukune with Teriyaki (wagyu beef meat ball) was disappointing and lacked flavour and seasoning. The Teppan Gyoza had a very heavy sauce that overpowered everything. The Tokyo Shoyu Ramen Raijin was very good but for the cost, you can definitely get a larger bowl elsewhere for the same quality.

The bill came to ~$40 with tax and tip included. Overall, I don't know it was worth that price, especially since there's so many options all over the GTA with similar food options."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

It was gonna be Zakkushi or Kingyo for my izakaya dinner stop during Good Friday, and I chose Zakkushi as I managed to find parking closer to that restaurant. Not just that, but there were actually seats available inside, so we didn't have to wait.

We were greeted...well, as we expected, by loud, jubilant waitresses who shout phrases in unison. This place is also authentic Japanese (unlike Guu, which is Korean), as the table beside me actually conversed with all the employees in Japanese, and everyone spoke with a common language throughout the restaurant and the kitchen.

The menus were already provided in each of the tables, and are quite extensive. They particularly have a large yakitori menu, but a respectable amount of sushi, sashimi, and appetizers as well. If you order 3 of the appetizers, you get a nice overall discount by paying only $5.80 in total!

I ordered the takowasabi, shiokara, and hotaruika to start. Both the shiokara and hotaruika tasted very good with different kinds of sauce used (the shiokara sauce is particularly thick). The takowasabi is decent, but it is not for the person who isn't wasabi tolerant (such as myself); your eyes will burn and you will feel the aftereffects for a while.

In the yakitori, we ordered the wagyu beef (x3), wagyu beef tsukune (x2), duck breast, cheese tsukune, umeshiso yaki (x3), and carbonara udon. All of them were excellent except for the wagyu beef, which was unfortunately quite tough. Too bad, cause personally I don't think wagyu beef is a good candidate for yakitori style, but grilled or marinated other ways it's such an awesome type of beef.

Again, service was simply excellent, and the place is loud but not to the unbearable level where you can't have an actual conversation with your friends without breaking your vocal cords. They keep track of your orders, so if you have something missing, they will know; no need to remind them.

I would like to try Kingyo next time before making a firm decision on whether to return here, but I was definitely impressed."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! 

The service is always super friendly and they seem to work as a team extremely well. 

The skewers are delish, the salmon sashimi is amazing and the beef tataki is something I crave on the regular... There's just something about the deep fried garlic on top that sends my taste buds for a whirl!

Only bummer is that if you're as hungry as I am when I go, you'll tend to break the bank if you fill up... But you've just gotta treat yourself to it sometimes!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars. Probably the best place for grilled meat and skewers Japanese style. The place is extremely friendly and service is 5 stars. Because the restaurant is in a house format, they've also decorated it so that it gives off a very cozy and casual feel. The atmosphere is perfect for friendly gatherings with friends and family. The meat is grilled to perfection and they have some interesting items on the menu. Though it is quite expensive (around $200/party of 4) but depends what you order. good quality meat comes at a price! With that said, it does feel a bit cramped however; because the tables are quite narrow and quite close to other ones so privacy might not be the best. If you're looking for a good conversation with a date, try somewhere more quiet. 

Recommendations on what to order:
Scallops 
Pork intestines 
Chicken knee (sea salt)
Fried rice with radish
Grilled chicken wings
Takoyaki 
Grilled squid 
Chicken heart"}
{"text":"3.5 for me. Authentic Japanese izakaya style restaurant with good food and vibes but a bit weak on the service. Zakkushi looks cool with small wooden tables and chairs in a pretty tight space. You might find it less comfortable than some other places but it makes it more authentic in my opinion. We made reservations and came in on a Thursday night. The place was full and had lineups (although short ones) throughout the night. The service was a bit slow for my liking but the food made up for it.

The menu consists of a lot of skewers (beef, chicken, pork and seafood), udons / noodles, regular izakaya dishes (like chicken karrage) and some Dons. Oh and obv booze, beer works best with izakaya food. We ordered a bunch of things and enjoyed most. There were a couple skewers that were a bit too salty but generally they were tasty. I'd highlight the udon carbonara which was my favorite dish of the night. 

Pricing is on the higher side with skewers ranging for $2 for one up to 7 or 8$! Be careful because the bill can rack up like crazy. They also made a mistake on our bill but corrected it when I pointed it out.

 Overall, still a positive experience so I'd recommend trying."}
{"text":"Pretty cool environment and one of the very few yakitori places in Toronto, authentic japanese restaurant with japanese cooks....we tried the meat ball, gizzard, mochi (yuck), mushroom, and pork with chicken skewers....they were all aite, relatively priced but not the best I have had 
Yam fries were terrible, they literally just chopped up a sweet potato and fried, not worth it at all 

It's a cool place to hang out but the food isn't really worth it"}
{"text":"Very lively, loud, crowded, somewhat good service. The food is nothing special, I mean, it's alright but I've had better. The portions are small (they are Japanese tapas) and expensive. For tapas I would prefer other places. It's a good hangout, but I expected better food."}
{"text":"I feel like my second trip back wasn't as good :\

-Premium skewers: I wouldn't order this next time. Our rankings are - beef tongue/wagyu beef, chicken thigh, duck breast, meatballs from best to worst
-P-toro: crunchy & juicy pork..theeeee best. Next time, I'm only gonna order this lol.
-Chicken thigh: this was just ok, but it somehow came out better than the \"premium\" chicken thigh?
-Strawberry sensation w/soda..yum.
-Chicken karaage: good, but nothing special
-Chicken wing: what a waste of stomach space, don't order this
-Negi tongue (beef tongue w/onion): def the better beef tongue of the 2
-Gyu tongue: beef tongue that's better & thinner than premium, but not as good as the negi, might be a personal preference thing though
-Sockeye salmon sashimi: good..thick slices.
-Special of the day was chicken hip: if p-toro & chicken skin had a baby, this would be it! Fatty in the middle, crispy on the outside.

Boo for no chicken skin. :("}
{"text":"Wait times were a bit long, but the overall quality of the skewered food was on point. I would suggest just sticking with the cheap stuff since it's hard to justify the price of wagyu beef. The chicken tsukune was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The overall vibe is just so lovely and cheerful. Virtually everything tastes good here and Sapporo on tap is fresh and crisp.

I really like the ambience and the friendliness of the staff. Wait time can get long so make sure you reserve a spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. The staff were really friendly in greeting us, which helped to ease the pain of a really long wait. I think we waited around an hour just to get seated. The food came fast once we sat down so it was good. Ordered the mega beer which was massive! The food was fresh and grilled to perfection! I would definately go again, if I had the money!"}
{"text":"This isn't a spot to be missed, both because of the quality of the food and the wide array of offerings. It's a quieter place with welcoming vibe.

Once seated, you'll be offered a hot towel for your hands.
The barley tea works as a delicious palate cleanser between dishes. And you'll want to try as many dishes as you can.

The star of the show is the agé mochi. Each piece is a sticky mouthful of rice topped with shredded seaweed and crunchy toasted sesame seeds that are in perfect contrast with the sweet soy sauce.

That's not to say that any other dish is less than delicious. The zucchini skewer, the garlic prawn, the scallops or the BBQ beef are delicious as well and belong to my favorites.
Actually, everything you taste here is awesome.

One of the best Japanese restaurants in town is worth visiting even if you're not the biggest fan of Asian cuisine or sushi. You won't leave hungry for sure!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying GET THE MOCHI ICECREAM DESSERT! 

Now that I've gotten that out of my system, here are some of the dishes we got: 
Sample appetizer (pick 3): we got jellyfish, monkfish liver, and tako wasa. Taste was great but portions so small it wasn't really worth the price. Would def get the monkfish liver on its own next time. 
Beef tataki: nothing special, slices were too big thus hard to chew. 
Mentaiko udon: SO GOOD  way better than Menami
Salmon Avocado Carpaccio: it was good but not that memorable, taste like how it should. 
Mixed sashimi natto: loved this! Was delicious, but would not recommend if you have never tried natto- it's an acquired taste. 

DESSERT: fried mochi with vanilla icecream & what looked/tasted like a maple syrup reduction. Oh my goodness. This was perfectly executed and so delicious! Did not think maple syrup would be a good sauce but it was very light and added to the overall dish refreshingly. This was definitively the highlight of the meal. 

Most people come here for the skewers, we didn't find them very memorable. The taste was very average. 

The staff here are very friendly and atmosphere is loud and fun! I would come back if my friends wanted to, there are some things I enjoyed but overall only the dessert stood out to me."}
{"text":"There are some definite pluses to Zakkushi. The price for their Sapporo is really reasonable at 5.20 a pint. Or even better deals for their mega pint or pitcher if you are looking at scoring some beer for the cheapest price you can. Also, the wooden space  inside has a cool vibe to it. It definitely doesn't feel like you are in Toronto... but perhaps even JAPAN?!?!?

The first thing that falls flat for me though is their beer selection. On the menu they only had Sapporo, though I think they have two taps, and I believe they had Asahi as well. The big issue here though is having such a small beer selection for what I consider a bar first, and a restaurant second. The portions of food for the price you pay is really out of whack. You wouldn't want to go here unless you were just going to grab some drinks, and have something to nibble on. I've been to places like this where the portions are much bigger. Food is good, but not good enough to compensate for this. There are some interesting items on the menu, but nothing stood out to me as something that you would need to order. Though I'd say stay away from the appetizer sampler because I've never seen somewhere be so cheap with the seaweed.

If you are like me, I would get my izakaya on elsewhere."}
{"text":"Zakkushi is the japanese yakitoria (skewer pub) above the fantastic sushiya.
Everyone likes to compare Japanese yakitoria and izakaya to Guu so here goes. Food is better and more consistent than Guu. The noise level of course is not as high as Guu, but it s loud of course. Usually the establishments are packed by Chinese customers licking up a taste of Japan but on our last visit most customers were Japanese themselves which is a good sign for authenticity and authentic it is.
Yakitori on charcoal, sake, meat salads, fried meat and a very limited dessert menu you can ignore without worrying. It is winter and they have an oden (mixed vegetables and fish in Japanese sake and mirin broth) menu.
Very good: oden, beef tongue and hatsu heart.
Good: atmosphere which is fun but not too loud you cannot hear your friends and the authentic wood decoration.
Bad: chicken karaage was not crispy (it is average style and they do not offer tatsutaage) and mushy unagi. Izakaya portions: small everything means you have to order again and again. This is the way it is at izakaya.
if you drink it will be $60/person
If you do not drink it will be $35 per person.
They do not have green tea on the menu. They have removed shiokara from the menu.
Finally, to the 145 cm Napoleon complex girl who was pushing everyone in line to get herself ahead saying \"we have reservation\": it was fun seeing you sit last and get a lesson in humility. Everyone else had reservations too. Too late for milk."}
{"text":"Food cost is a little pricey but good.  Staff are really friendly. The food however took quite a while to get on our table. I'd come back only if someone else is paying for it."}
{"text":"Great place. A great addition from the west. I have been to the one in Vancouver last December and couldn't wait until it comes to Toronto. It is not as authentic as the Vancouver one. But the food is great and the beer saporo is amazing."}
{"text":"Going to agree with most Yelpers here, the best yakitoris in Toronto, and and the amazing ambience makes my dining experience a 5 star.

Huge menu with a great selection of traditional Japanese dishes. Menu reminds me of Guu's menu/layout - lots of small plates to share. Besides the skewers that everyone raves about, I also got nato, which is one of my favourite Japanese dishes. It's almost impossible to find fresh nato in Toronto, and they have it here! Comes in a bowl with cubed sashimi in it, and seaweed on the side.

Matcha dessert sounds amazing after a ton of meat, was not disappointed!! 

Service is great, food came quickly as well. Will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"One of the best Izakayas in Toronto, for sure! I've usually visited off peak hours (11pm or so) so I can't say much with regards to wait times, but the food and service here is definitely one of the best in the city. 

Food comes fairly fast once you order, and everything is as delicious as you'd imagine they'd be. From the karaage, the ebimayo, to the takoyaki and momo (chicken thigh), everything comes out fresh and in the case of the takoyaki, piping hot! You'd think that after the first piece, someone would learn not to eat one right as soon as it gets served...

Lots of items however are priced PER PIECE, so double check the items you're ordering as it can definitely lead to an expensive dinner. Regardless, it's definitely worth the price and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food and vibe! The servers are friendly, the food is excellent, although the way it comes out is a bit chaotic and inconsistent. However, the atmosphere is cheerful, and I was really impressed with the flavours of all the dishes I ordered. I wasn't too adventurous, but got chicken and prawn skewers, the calamari, pasta carbonara and a Japanese pancake dessert with matcha ice cream! Will definitely be back!!! Thumbs up, thanks for a great night!!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place needs me to toot their horn; I mean, what's better than meat on sticks and alcohol?  So I will simply recommend the stuff that I really liked so that first-timers won't feel overwhelmed by the large selection.

I highly recommend the following:
- P-toro
- Premium tongue
- Umeshisho tsukune
- Kawa
- Akimo
- Grilled onigiri
- Almond tofu dessert (taste more like a creamy custard than tofu)

If you're into the izakaya environment but not all that into raw fish, then Zakkushi is the place to be!"}
{"text":"All the yakitori were perfectly grilled. My personal favorite was the liver, horumon and chicken hearts. The servers were so accommodating and nice. A great place to chow down and wash it down with a nice cold beer."}
{"text":"Have tried about half the menu here, it's a fun atmosphere to hangout with a group (big or small). However the food was not as flavourful as I would like. The majority of the food is grilled, and they have a good variety. Do not come here and expect to get full"}
{"text":"To start off, the staff for this place is extremely nice. They are well mannered and do not give you the cold shoulder, despite it being really busy. The interior is also well kept and is very beautiful and relaxing. Although it appears to be quite small, it is actually quite roomy. There is enough leg space and space for the food.

Moving onto the food, the food is quite good. The wagyu beef is extremely tender and full of flavour. The rest of the skewers were ok, and definitely not worth the price. The wagyu beef, taking the price into consideration, is fairly reasonable. Overall, the price is quite high for the skewers, with the exception of the wagyu beef. The ones that I tried were the salmon, beef tongue, oropon beef and scallops.

Aside from the skewers, the takoyaki and p-toro is really good and totally worth. The takoyaki is quite tender and was made really well. The p-toro with the spicy majo tasted really good and you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"butter melted into Hot Sweet potatoes ?dipping source is honey! Its such a healthy and yummy appetizer?scallop?eel ,beef tongue ? mochi?everything worth thumbs up?hey?please go and try?"}
{"text":"Pretty good meats on a stick, the price was good, and the service was excellent!  Came back for a second night and as usual their liver was amazing n their chuck thighs were so juicy!  Love it!  Gotta get the bbq beef as well!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my SO's birthday with friends and it was great! The staff were attentive and they helped to make it a very memorable day.

I called in advance to make reservations for a large party. The reservation was accepted with no problems. They let me bring my own birthday cake, with no plating fee! Amazing! When they brought the birthday cake out at the end of our meal, they turned off all the lights in the restaurant and played \"Happy Birthday\" over the speakers. They even took a group picture of us with a Polaroid camera and gave it to the birthday boys as a gift. Pretty great!

The food was fantastic as well. I recommend trying the Waygu beef skewers and the beef tataki. Ask your server for recommendations of Sake and you won't be disappointed! I thought the price of food items was justified for the most part with their quality and taste. However, some things were indeed overpriced. For example, 1/2 of a pretty small okonomiyaki was $7.50...

All in all, I had a very positive experience and I will be returning here!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check this place out, and it definitely did not disappoint! We didn't make a reservation and had to wait around an hour to be seated. When we sat down, we were so excited that we basically ordered everything on the menu... 

The beef skewers: we ordered all of the skewers from the beef section and none of them were specially memorable....

The chicken skewers: 
- Momo chicken thigh: how is this so delicious? We started with one skewer and ended up ordering 3 more of just this.
- Umeshiso: light and interesting flavor, wouldn't order again
- Heart/Gizzard/liver: all delicious, would order again! 

The premium skewers:
- Wagyu beef: not my cup of tea... given this is the first time I had \"wagyu\", I had nothing to compare it to. It just kind of tasted like a piece of pure beef fat to me. 
- Premium tongue: thicker slice and much more tender than the non-premium skewer. This was one of my favorite skewers we ordered! 

Others:
- Cheese Mochi maki: this is what dreams are made of. You have to order one! 
- Chicken knee karaage: This was life changing...it had the perfect balance of crunch, grease, and flavor. You definitely need to be a fan of cartilage to like this dish though! 
- Age mochi: delicious, but I'd suggest getting the cheese mochi maki instead
- Mental carbonara udon: Best dish of the night. Who would have thought I would have the best carbonara at a yakitori joint? The addition of the cod roe pairs perfectly with the creaminess of the dish. I might need to come back just to have this again. 

All of this cost us around 120 for two people. I don't know if I can justify for the wait and price of this place again... We'll have to see!"}
{"text":"Great yakitori spot! From the service ambiance and food, thanks for a wonderful meal. Ordered alot of skewers, oden and yakisoba. All were amazing. Will be back soon! And im telling my friends about everything!"}
{"text":"Zakkushi remains one of my favourite izakaya in Toronto. The yakitori is brilliant, and the other dishes are fantastic too. Cannot beat the atmosphere. Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll start off by saying I've been to Japan twice and used to go to Izakaya all the time in Korea (which I realize isn't the same as the real thing in Japan, but the flavours/style seems to be more similar than what I've seen in Canada).

Quite frankly this place is really expensive. You're getting very small portions of food considering the price. 

The okonomoyaki seemed to miss ingredients. And while the food is flavourful it's sometimes a bit off from what it should be. But then maybe I'm being the arrogant traveller and unrealistic. That being said, the friends I've gone with or have brought, have also been less than impressed. 

The service has ranged to really attentive to a bit rude. It seems to just depend on who you get. 

Honestly, the food is good and the atmosphere is great. But I'm not yet convinced that the price is worth the cost."}
{"text":"Excellent izakaya! Their menu is a little more down-to-earth and simple compared to Guu, but it's still solid.

Wait is long, so make sure to call in ahead of time to make reservations. It seems that everyone who got a table there had called in ahead of time--meaning regulars who know what they're doing!

Would definitely come back a second, third and fourth time!"}
{"text":"Excellent noodles (though need more selection!) and skewers. Open late and is a great place to end a night out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
Best Japanese restaurant in downtown, when ever I have friends to come over I'll take them to this place!

Nice food, nice staff and cold beer!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, ambience and service. The individual skewers ranges from $1.80 to $8 for the wayu beef. They have every types of meat here from chicken to beef to whelk. For those looking for something exotic, you can try their gizzard, tongue, liver and intestines. Since those aren't my cup of tea, I stuck to chicken, beef and vegetable skewers. The king oyster mushroom is da bomb. I can't get enough of it.  Aside from skewers, they also have appies and entrees like salmon avo and various udon stir fry. There is something for everyone here.  

The service was super efficient and fast. We got all of our order quickly and accurately. I'm still amazed how they didn't mess up the 80+ skewers we ordered. Good job guys!!! 

Tip: the Sapporo pitcher is $12.99 here for all your beer lovers!"}
{"text":"The main floor atmosphere was fun and vibrant...reminded us of Japan.  The staff were extremely polite, efficient and welcoming. The decor was on point with a traditional Japanese yakitori restaurant. 

Drinks: 
ginger ale with fresh ginger - sweet and refreshing with the ginger 

Food:
We tried at least a dozen or so yakitori skewers and really enjoyed the following: waygu beef, premium beef tongue, oroppn beef, uzura maki, and p- toro.  All were juicy, savory and grilled to perfection!

The giant scallop, however, was not what we expected. A little on the pricy side and we would not order it again 

The ikamaki oden was soft and moist. Despite its taste, it did not match our palette.

Sauce yakisoba: the sauce was extremely tasty (seemed to be a combo of okonomiyaki sauce with a hint of mustard) which was balanced perfectly with pickled vegetables. 

We would definitely comeback again."}
{"text":"We came here at 1:30 AM on a late night whim. 

The first thing I thought when I stepped into the restaurant was \"thank the lord for not screaming my ears off\". 

Like all the izakaya restaurants in Toronto, I left this restaurant a bit confused. I would give it 3.5 stars.

What I liked- The food was very fresh, authentic, well-seasoned, refined and palatable. I must say the Wagyu beef skewer with oropon sauce was probably the best I have ever eaten in Toronto. Huge thumbs up to the sashimi plate as well. 

What I was \"meh\" about- The service. Despite coming late at night with probably the minimal number of customers, service was slow. This was also the FIRST Japanese restaurant I went to where green tea was not complimentary. C'mon, green tea is basically equivalent to hot water in Japanese cuisine. 

What I didn't like- The BILL. Even though I barely ate anything and did not drink, the bill amounted to almost $30. This is really steep, regardless of how \"oishii\" the food was. 

Great food, but a wallet burner if you want to be full."}
{"text":"Awesome place, hyped environment just like Guu.
Friendly service, they're always checking up on you and cleaning up the plates.

Food arrives quickly and fresh. The bill does add up quite quickly with the skewers having to be ordered individually but the quality of the service and food is well worth the price."}
{"text":"I feel this is the best and most authentic Yakatori in Toronto and I have been to many of them.  Book early or be prepared to wait--they are ALWAYS busy."}
{"text":"3.5 stars?

I was really excited about this. Finally some sort of yaki tori, but I was kinda disappointed at the skewers of meat, they definitely didn't come at a constant stream, and some of the stuff was cold or overcooked. 

The drinks were good, and the app were great. Service is attentive.

Would go again, but definitely wouldn't order a few things, and boy are they packed."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto so far. Their skewers were delicious. Make sure to try their oden if you haven't."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for dinner with a large group of friends. I had a couple things- Ebi mayo, the carbonara udon, and two skewers (forgot which ones) and they were all good. The price was comparable to Guu, but it wasn't as loud so I could actually hear my friends talking loll. I'd go back for a date but it's a bit expensive as izakayas usually are on the pricier side but def would come back !!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. Burnt the eel the first time, but we were able to get a new one that was cooked right."}
{"text":"Friendly service and you can opt to sit by the counter (chef's table). The yakitoris are amazingly juicy and seasoned well. If you're a beef fan, then you should definitely try the \"premium set,\" so you get to taste different cuts of the beef, chicken and eel."}
{"text":"I feel like I've taken a step back into Japan when I came to Zakkushi, much so because of the service and hospitality. The waiters and waitresses are so respectful and they all greet and thank you, in almost perfect harmony. I enjoyed my first time here, but I'm not sure I could muster another visit though because of the price.

Each skewer starts at around $3 and goes up from there, depending on the cut of meat. They have 'sets' you can choose from if you want a variety. They don't save you much (around $1.50) but if you want everything the specific set has, then you're in luck.

They also have ramen, odeng, and rice bowls if you want something different, but they set you back starting from about $9. Portion sizes are pretty small too.

Don't get me wrong. I like the flavour of almost everything they have to offer. I just can't justifying paying that amount. I spent probably $20-25 there, but still felt hungry after I left.

Zakkushi is a great place for socials, but if you're looking for a meal to fill you up, I would probably pass on this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants, I've dined there several time.  I love their food with beer and atmosphere there.  If you can, go earlier to avoid the busy waiting time."}
{"text":"The one thing great about living abroad is coming back for a visit and your friends stuff your face with deliciousness, even if it's deliciousness you didn't think would be delicious. How many times did I use the word delicious?

When my friend told me he was taking me to go eat skewers, I have already equivocated skewers to be synonymous with Chinese lamb skewers and had forgotten about the delicious (doing it again) japanese skewers. Still, when I learned it was more yakitori style, I was still not excited.

That is, until we sat down, and he ordered. I dunno what he ordered because they all looked the same to be, but all tasted different, and i was too busy stuffing my face skewers after skewers (and some other dishes like takowasa, udon carbonara, tuna avocado, etc., etc.)

But you know what I did wrong? I did not save room for dessert. What a freaking mistake because they were so good that I ate all of them anyway. And when I say all of them, I had almond tofu, macha ice cream dorayaki (red bean pancake), sticky rice with vanilla ice cream, AND green tea panna cotta. WTF...my friends are spoiling me into a fat pig. i was not a fan of the sticky rice dessert, but everything else i cannot decide whats better, and i dont even like dessert!

You torontoians have no idea how good you have life!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit at this restaurant. I definite brought back memories of our trip to Japan. The place is lively and the food was great. The eel has a bit of a texture nothingnlike thenone we had is Japan but the scallops are amazing. It was a bit on the expensive side but well worth the experience! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place isn't cheap. I spent around $70 for one person and had about 8 skewers, 3 small appetizer and a bottle of sake. The sake cold was a good way to offset some of the saltiness of the food. The meat skewers were small. I liked the chicken over the pork skewers. I also had the quail eggs which were quite good and I would recommend. Their chicken wings were good too. I ended with the cheese mochi skewers which were just okay. Overall you need to come with friends. They have a traditional sushi bar underneath the restaurant which I would come back to try again."}
{"text":"Great smoke, great atmosphere, great servers, great food!

The yakitori here is cheap and very delicious. But when I say cheap, I do not mean cheap cheap; I simply mean relatively cheap compared to all other yakitori places. You are definitely getting less food but the quality is worth the amount that you are paying... 

The way they cook their skewers is over their charcoal -I think Japanese charcoal which makes the meat tender and juicy and requires very little seasoning. There is definitely a strong touch of smoke in their skewers. My favorite was the chicken liver. They cook it on the medium-rare side and it was like butter in your mouth. I assume that this is okay because I am hoping that their chicken is super fresh and imported from somewhere where the chickens are well looked after... you know, have had a great life to live, had a few love interactions with other chickens, all given names like Jesse or Tibor and slaughtered humanly at just the right age... The chicken balls with cheese and mayo are also very delicious. The steak with green onion sauce sells out fast so make sure to order one of those... Chicken wing yakitori is the best chicken wing that I've had in my life... Pork with just plain salt is amazing as well... just order everthing! Umm... I'd suggest to come here mainly for the skewers, the other food items are well prepared as well but not as well as Guu's food for sure. 

Otherwise, I would highly recommend. 

Cheers."}

{"text":"Zakkushi was super happening on a Saturday night, or should I say morning... at 1:30am. Just when we lost hope of finding an izakaya to nosh at after hours (Guu and Kingyo were both closed), I saw that Zakkushi was still open (using Yelp of course!). From the outside, it actually looked kind of dark, and potentially closed, but once you go in, it's like a secret world! The place was bustling, full of people eating after hours and really enjoying themselves. There was plenty of selection of skewers to choose from, and they were all quite delicious. Also enjoyed their Yaki Soba and takoyaki. Probably nothing earth shattering, but I just love late night eats, and this is definitely going to be a place I'll come back to."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and was told us the restaurant would be packed. We were given 1.5 hr seating limit but the restaurant turned out half empty. We ordered some skewers, which looked good in pictures, actual taste is nothing special. 

The table next to us left with leftover skewers they didn't finish. We saw the waitress taking it back to the kitchen instead of throwing it out. I guess they recooked it and served it to the next customer. So you could be eating someone else's leftovers. Yuck."}
{"text":"Zakkushi is surprisingly good. 

Love the Sake Combo ($9.99) and Shochu Combo ($9.99) great value since each orders comes with 3 different appetizers. Next time I want to have the Sapporo Combo!

Love the grilled items that we ordered:
Liver ($1.60) Gizzard ($1.90) Heart ($1.60) Teba ($1.90)

Love the deep fried Nankotsu ($4.60), chicken tender bone perfect to go with drinks and my favourite pub food

I would not order Mentai Potato ($1.80) again.

Love the atmosphere and the vibe at Zakkushi! Good food reasonable price drinks. Though it is a little out of the way, but it is worth to come here for a drink with friends and have some fun!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time visit to Zakkushi and I wouldn't mind my third or fourth. If you are a big fan of Japanese cuisine, be sure to come here.
Service is great and food is great too! Zakkushi is specialized on their skewers. The price is quite reasonable for the taste and quality of food ($6-$10 per skewer). The bill adds up quite quickly so be sure to come with some extra bucks!

They also serve larger bottles of sake that you may never find in LCBO stores."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here! We were lucky that our friend made reservations for is on Friday night as the place was bustling with people waiting for seats. The waiter and waitresses were very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. 

The food took a little longer than usual, but we sat next to the grill and saw that each and every order were made fresh so it was worth it. 

Oh my goodness those crunchy juicy pork skewers were to DIE for. If I could, I would've had at least 5 to myself, but there were so many other great things on the menu to discover! Another favourite I had but didn't take a picture of were the \"horumon\" grilled pork intestine w/ BBQ sauce skewers. If you're in for an adventure, definitely give this a try. 

We took the advice on Waze and found a Green P parking lot about 4-5 minutes walk away from the restaurant, but we also noticed street parking available nearby, but we didn't want to have the hassle of finding a spot AND parallel parking. 

The bathrooms were kept very clean and tidy so that was a very good sign that the rest of the restaurant was also kept hygienic and CLEAN."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday and it was fairly full. I had a reservation made the day before. Service was very slow and we waited almost 10 minutes for water after asking twice. 

Coming here the big highlight was their wagyu beef. We ordered the $26 wagyu steak and it was honestly a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe I've been too spoiled from eating wagyu in Japan, but the beef did not taste anything special or had any sort of visible marbling. There were only 7-8 pieces and it was fairly well done. The vegetables part of that plate tasted better than the meat itself. 

Despite my disappointment for the wagyu, the other dishes we had were fairly decent. My favourite was the yakitori, it's nicely seasoned and tasted really hot and fresh. I would really recommend the karaage as it's probably one of the better tasting one around the GTA. For dessert I got the green tea with red bean pancake, not gonna lie it looked so good on pictures but it didn't taste that special. Green tea ice cream was good but the pancake was a little dry. This place is alright but not worth coming back for a second time."}
{"text":"Went to Zakkushi (@ZakkushiCarlton) around 2 weeks ago when it  just open and they didn't even had a sign up or liquor license yet. Zakkushi is a Japanese Style pub with 3 successful Vancouver locations has recently open it's door on Carlton St.


The restaurant is best know for it's kushiyaki (skewer meat) cooked over binchotan which is a white smokeless charcoal made from Japanese Oak
It's mid size with around 70-80 seats

 Appetizer Sampler $5.80 any 3 (or $3-$3.5 each)
Shiokara ~ Marinated squid w/ special Shiokara Sauce
Hotaruika ~ Marinated fresh baby squid w/ soy sauce
 Goma-ae ~ Boiled spinach w/ sesame sauce

 Goma-ae $4.60
~ Deep Fried chicken knee cartilage
~ Love soft bone but the batter here was rather bland and soft (wish it was crispier)

 Original Oden w/  choice of 5 toppings $6.80
~ Daikon, Takenoko (Bamboo shoot), Tofu, Ikamaki (Fish cake stuffed w/ squid)
& Konnyaku (Yam cake)
~ This was really flavorful, probably one of the yummiest I had in Toronto. I usually don't like yam cake but this was was really good, the perfect texture and perfect with the broth. Even the daikon and tofu are really well cook/marinated which was perfect since the broth although flavorful was on the light side.

 Premium Set $19.80 & Zakkushi Set $8.80
~ By getting the set you save a bit compare to ordering separately, thought it was a good idea to try some of their signature skewers since it was our first time here.

 Premium Set $19.80
Wagyu Beef ~ wagyu beef skewer w/ Oropon Sauce ($6.8/ea)
Premium Beef Tongue ~ thick cut beef tongue w/ salt & pepper ($4.2/ea)
Free Range Chicken Momo ~ Free Range chicken tight w/ salt ($3.2/ea)
Wagyu Beef Tsukune (sauce) ~ wagyu beef meat ball ($3.5/ea)
Unagi ~ Eel w/ terriyaki sauce & Sansho pepper ($5.8/ea)

Although the Wagyu beef was really good and you could definitely taste the difference compare to the regular beef skewer that they have, I don't know if I am willing to pay $6.80 for one skewers.
I actually didn't really like the thick cut beef tongue since it was so thick, it tasted like beef.... while there was really nothing special about the meat balls and unagi. The chicken momo was the one that stood out here, it was perfectly cook, moist and the meat itself was so flavorful.

 Zakkushi Set $8.80
Oropon Beef ~ w/ grated Daikon $ Ponzu sauce ($2.4/ea)
P-toro ~ Crunchy & juicy pork ($1.8/ea)
Me Maki ~ Garlic stubs wrapped w/ pork ($1.9/ea)
Momo (sauce)~ Chicken tight ($1.6/ea)
Umeshiso Yaki ~ Chicken thight w/ sour plum & Japanese basil ($1.9/ea)

Given it's price compare to the first set, everything here was surprisingly good.
I was impress at how thin the pork was for Me Maki that was wrapped around the garlic stubs which make it extra crispy. I also really like the sour plum sauce on the umeshiso yaki which make it a bit different.

 Yakioni (Shoyu or Butter Shoyu) $1.8/ea
~ Grilled rice ball w/ a choice of soy sauce or butter soy sauce
~ I love this one and yes I can never go without carbs for long (love my rice/noodle/bread).
~ Love this crispy goodness, just like the crispy rice bottom of Chinese Rice pot or Korean BiBimBap.
~ Tried both flavor and I like the Shoyu better since you can taste the rice flavor better.
~ I loved it so much that I had a 2nd

 Ankimo $5.2
~ Cold Monkfish liver (Japanese Foie Gras style)
~ This was the probably the only thing I didn't like that night.... it was rather bland tasting, it needs more sauce (sour /salty)

 Shishito $1.9
~ Twist pepper w/ soy sauce & bonito flakes
 Chicken Heart $1.6
~I actually prefer the Chinese/Mongolian heart skewer version better...
 Kawa $1.6 & Taba $1.9
~ Chicken Skin (salt) & Chicken wing
~ Both are really good, perfect crispy skin... nom nom nommm
 Cheese Mochi Maki $2.4
~ Sticky rice wrapped w/ pork & melted cheese
~ Had always love sticky rice cake and this was even better with fatty pork and cheese
~ Need to try make something like that at home ;)

The bamboo cup thing was to hold your finished skewers and that how many the 2 of us ate =P

 Dorayaki Matcha Ice Cream $3.5
~ matcha ice cream and red bean in Japanese pancake
~ Ben insisted to order this and I warned him that the pancake is probably store bought and will be dry... and I was right.

 Kinako Mochi Ice Cream $3.8
~ soy powder sprinkle vanilla ice cream & sticky rice w/ maple syrup
~ Love love love this, instead of the regular mochi it was warm toasted sticky rice cake which had a crispy exterior and super sticky gooyee interior.... and was perfect w/ the cold ice cram while the soy powder just push it up a notch. 

 Verdict :
~ Try not to order everything at once since almost everything came at the same time and some dishes just got cold by the time we ate it.
~ Love all the variety of skewers to choose from
~ Can't wait to go back and have everything with a beer or sake (they got their LLBO)"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I am not a yakitori kind of person.  And i am not much of an izakaya person either because of the know long wait times. However, i was willing to give Zakkushi a try since the reviews have been pretty good - under one condition. I was not willing to line up... so reservations were a must.

We made reservations for 5:30pm. We arrived around 5:15...do we had to wait around outside until they opened their doors. Do not bother arriving early because they will not let you inside the waiting area. So if it is a cold day... waiting outside might not be the greateat idea.

We ordered about 11 dishes - the premium set which included wagyu beef and bef tongue, sweet shrimp sashimi, the nwgi p-toro don, and scallops to name a few. Our food came pretty quickly and consistently one dish after another. Everything seemed to have been prefectly timed. The shrimp sashimi however did not seem fresh as the meat was a little mushy but the flavour was fine. The rice was a bit heavy and filling but the pork pieces were absolutely delicious! 

To finish off our meal, we ordered two desserts - kinako mochi ice cream and the dorayaki matcha ice cream. I didnt really like the pancakes part if the dorayaki as they were a bit crumbly. It wasnt the texture i was expecting. But the mochi ice cream was interesting as the mochis seemed to have a fried texture to them.

Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious! ...aside from the pancakes. 

When it came to paying... we did our usual precentage for gratuities... however, when the transaction went thru, it seemed like the tip amount was not included. Our server was ballsy enough to tell us the amount on the bill did not include \"service fee\". We were quite comfused as we did include a tip amount but was not picked up by the machine. Good thing our server brought it to our attention! Ballsy but necessary!  Gratuity was well deserved for such wonderful service and tastey foods! So we tipped in cash."}
{"text":"Yeah it's good! Especially the cheese and the berry one, I just forgot the name but they are awesome."}
{"text":"I went there for oden.  It was really good. Also their desserts were amazing. The luckiest thing was I got to try their seasonal dessert, Sakura mochi. It looked like a piece of art and the flavour was unique."}
{"text":"Most food here are yakitoria food instead of normal izakaya type
the portion of the skewer is pretty small so the bill might come out a bit expensive
but it's definitely worth it!!!
service, food, ambience 5/5 
price 3/5"}
{"text":"Haven't had real Yakatori probably since I lived Japan and Zakkushi did a terrific job reacquainting me with the fun and deliciousness of a Yakatori night experience. 

It is Located in a house in the emerging Cabbagetown neighborhood, which is still somewhat raw and gritty compared to the emerging Corktown (yes with a C) and other nearby areas,  but, it did not stop the waves of young people from flocking in for some high quality yet inexpensive eats. Inside was packed, loud and playing nice techno house music. We were lucky to get the last outdoor table which allowed us to enjoy the music as lower dbs and the perfect night outside.

After ordering what seemed like way too much food for four people, we reordered two more times and finished that as well. The food came fast and was perfectly grilled despite the tenderness of some of the items we ordered and hot when it arrived.  Our server, authentically Japanese, was charming and further authenticated our Yakatori experience. 

Favorites included the green garlic shoots wrapped in paper thin pork, thinly sliced and flash seared rib eye, chicken wrapped in Japanese bail with shaved daikon radish and scallion but none of the probably 20+ dishes we ordered were anything but very good.. That said, I probably would not order the the udon carbonara with squid again, not that it was bad but I do a killer Italian carbonara and couldn't make the taste transition work in my brain.

Inexpensive sake insures a good time is had by all!"}
{"text":"The appearance of Zakkushi from the street brought me back to my trips to Japan as the lights shining from the traditional paper lanterns glowed softly, extending its warm welcome to passersby to enter the restaurant.  
Once I went in, i was greeted by various wait staff in Japanese.  I definitely felt like i was being transported back to Japan.  The interior decor of the restaurant was predominently made from wood.  
A server brought me to my table and while waiting for my friends, I got an opportunity to study the various menus.  So many choices!!!  Zakkushi specialized in yakitori, and there were selections from each food group.  They also have other entrees if you are not too fond of yakitori skewers.  My friends and i ended up ordering some salmon and tuna sashimi, a wide selections of beef, chicken, and seafood yakitori.  We also treated ourselves to both warm and cold sake.  The food was fabulous   the servers were friendly.  The only minor situation was that they forgot to give us mayo with the chicken dish but they rectified that fast enough.  
It was a fantastic experience and i would definitely go there again.  Because the yakitori tasted so good, it was very easy to order more.  The only problem with that was the cost added up fast.  So keep that at the back of your mind when and if you do end up ordering more skewers.  Hopefully you will have a good time there what with the tasty food, friendly staff, and wonderful ambience."}
{"text":"we spent $100+ here for 2 people and were barely full. 
For each order of skewer you only get ONE, not a pair, so it's literally 2x as expensive as most yakitori in Tokyo.  The udon was underwhelming too.
I would only consider coming again if the portions were DOUBLED"}
{"text":"I've read several reviews and they're pretty much all glowing. Turns out my experience was nothing of the sort. I know that it's a busy restaurant and it's loud so I was prepared on that front. 

What I didn't like were the portion sizes. The beef don I ordered for $11 was tiny. I had a chirashi don at another Japanese restaurant the other day and although it cost more the amount of food that was in the bowl was representative of the price. I felt hungry after finishing my don but ordering another dish would've taken quite a while to arrive at the table. 

Moreover, the waiter forgot my friend's drink and we had to ask about her gyoza. I understand it's a busy place but gyoza couldn't possibly take that long to prepare. The table next to us was waiting quite some time for their food as well. There's plenty of other restaurants in downtown Toronto that I'd rather go to."}
{"text":"I'm just addicted to this place and try to come here whenever I can!! You can really taste the quality in the ingredients they use and it's just insane how good the food is!! 

Items ordered: 
- premium skewers (wagyu meatballs, free range chicken, duck breast, pork belly, wagyu beef)
- chicken karage
- butter and soy sauce rice balls
- beef tongue skewers
- bbq beef don
- sashimi platter (6pc)
- Sakura Swiss roll
All paired with a nice cold glass of sapporo, best izakaya in toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, not the portion size. I find everything over priced but taste was wonderful. Items are priced per skewer.  Service was good. No long waits for food to be served. Friendly staffs."}
{"text":"Zakkushi is your typical Izakaya run by real Japanese people just like Guu but both are completely different. (THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS!) As others have said you can go in comparing it to Guu but you wont find anything you can compare it to beecause Zakkushi is more the traditional Japanese Izakaya. 

That said, their skewers are really good the few that really stuck out for me are:
-Uzura Maki (Quail Eggs Wrapped in Pork)
-Premium Skewer Platter
-Chicken Cartilage 
-Pancake Redbean Desert 

The price was pretty fair especially with alcohol it came out to $65/head and we had ALOT of food. The service was extremely curious and the atmosphere is really relaxing and gives it a home town japan feel. One thing I would like to mention is that the washrooms are REALLY NICE just like the ones at Guu lol. (I just thought I would mention it always good to see restaurants taking a stand on grimy washrooms) The wait times were minimal and everything comes at a constant pace, if you have never tried it before it is definitely a place that you should try!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite little places to eat in the city! I've had almost everything on the menu and they make even the weirdest sounding food (ie. chicken knee cartilage) taste good! 

Recommendations:

1. Waygu beef skewer
2. Pork skewer (one of my faves and at a good price point)
3. Cheese mochi skewer (cheese, mochi and pork)
4. Sweet tofu dessert"}
