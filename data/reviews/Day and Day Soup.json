{"text":"Love this place. Food is delicious and it's inexpensive. Owners are friendly and they try their best to accommodate customers' needs. It's best to call to preorder your dishes and make reservation in advance to minimize the wait."}
{"text":"This place is something to explore. It has great meals but takes time to make and they make it fresh. But in order to get a table here you will have to make reservations. The soup will have to be ordered with your reservation if you want to try it. This place is great for groups."}
{"text":"This restaurant has two names. It is also called Day and Day Cafe. The menu is only in Chinese. There are limited amount of tables. They do not have plates available here, you will have to bring your own paper plates. Also, I only see 6 tables but apparently we were sitting at table 8...weird! They save king crab shells too, for what reason? Only god knows... If you want to order dinner sets I would advise that you order then 3 hours at advance because there seems to only be 1 guy in the kitchen. 

Food was decent though (typical Chinese place), and is cheaper than other places. Probably because they don't spend much on decor. It barely looks like a restaurant. You win some you lose some. Overall this place is a little under par but if you want cheap Chinese food if say go for it. I also think they may have karaoke.  Ca La Oh Kay!!"}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall place with only 6 tables. Don't come for the atmosphere unless you like old school street restaurants complete with plastic tablecloth and yelling. Everything is in Chinese so bring a translater, don't expect English anything. 
Great sweet and sour pork. Not to doughy or sweet, best I've had in a while. Nothing is really oily, everything was well seasoned and not too salty. Tastes like home cooking. Need to order ahead of time for certain dishes like lobster. 
Great place for down to earth Chinese food without any frills. Like none at all."}
{"text":"This place is super ghetto!!! But you can't beat the price! The prices are so cheap, you can't even buy the ingredients for what they charge for the dish. 

First time walking into this place, first thing I noticed is they used plywood to fence the entrance. Super ghetto! 

They have about 5 tables.. No waiter or waitress, just husband and wife running the joint. You have to get your own hot water from the tap for hot tea.

We sat down and looked at the menu (Chinese only), we were \"holy shit these prices are ridiculously cheap\".

So we wanted to order lobster, they were sold out..
We wanted to order chicken, they were sold out..
They were even sold out of steamed rice and didn't have any scallions in stock.. 

Turns out 85% of the menu was sold out... 

We ended up getting fresh streamed fish -  $12..
You can't even get the ingredients for $12 at T&T

We also have a pork-belly taro dish, it was kinda pricy.. And the taro wasn't soft enough.. 

We a oyster pancake, that was pretty good, enough oysters and good batter flavour.

The stir-fry veggie portion was huge!

Stir fry noodles was $5.99 and could 2 or 3 people for lunch!

End of the day, dinner for 4 was $55 and we have them $60 and told them to keep the change, and she insisted we don't have to tip them.. (Restaurants who don't accept tip, even if the customer insists?!?)

All-in-all, I would come back for fresh seafood, but you definitely have to get a menu and order 1 day ahead.. 

They also advertise \"bring your own seafood and they cook it for $8\" usually places change $8/lb.. This place only charges $8 bucks..

1lb fresh lobster congee is $8.99... What!?

Overall, first time dining in experience at this place was a fail because we and they were unprepared, first impression is shit, this really does look like a whole in the wall, but all 4 of us wouldn't mind coming back to give it a second try.. But must order ahead of time."}
{"text":"First time we came here, we thought that the food was delicious,and the price can't be beat, even recommended to friends, we came back 2 weeks later and found the food to be alright, we were wondering why the restaurant was so hot, only to find out they didn't turn the AC on. You cannot overlook the lack of service when one of us did not have a teacup, had to ask twice before we finally got it, there were no soup spoons either, no one to clear your dishes , we just piled ours onto another table. The sad thing was 4 out of 8 of us had the worse case of diarrhea the next day, lay in bed for 2 days. I don't know what it is, the food or maybe the restaurant was too hot, some food could have been spoiled."}
