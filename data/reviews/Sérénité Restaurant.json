{"text":"Excellent. The restaurant is remodeled the music and ambiance was nice. Very unique French menu. Everything from oysters, frog legs to steaks.  I had the best  goat cheese salad and the trout for main course. Everything was excellent. Had the Malbec wine which was the perfect pairing. Please support this restaurant. It's just what Medina needed   Usually new restaurants need need a few months to get it together but they have been opened 2 weeks and have their act together"}
{"text":"Serenite is absolutely wonderful.  It is the best restaurant in the Medina county area.  The various sauces that come with the steaks is one of the most refreshing touches I have seen at a restaurant.  The level of elegance at Serenite competes with some of the best in town.  The service was prompt and the food was some of the best I've had in a long time.  This is a refreshing change of pace for the area.  I will most definitely be returning for repeat visits!"}

{"text":"Wow! Truly an incredible experience, even Morris when the founder and GM both share the story behind this amazing French restaurant existing in an unlikely place. I advise you to look up the history behind it all. The drinks we began the evening with were unique and very well done. The menu is very French so be ready for that and I'd also advise being bold and trying something new. For me, I went with the Frog Legs appetizer. They could not have been better and more tasteful. Highly recommend getting over any squeamishness on these. I gave our terrific waiter three choices for dinner and had him choose his favorite. He brought out the Coq Au Vain. I've heard of it but never had it. Such a great selection. Our table also had the rabbit and salmon. Both great and again, unique and French. For dessert we went with their tableside-prepared flaming Bananas Foster and beignets. Both so well done and the pastry chef preparing the Bananas Foster explained with delight the story behind the famous dish. Our one issue on the food side was the salmon was a bit undercooked. This was quickly remedied with a new one and a complimentary bowl of lobster bisque while we waited. The look of the restaurant also scores very high despite its location in Medina's \"warehouse district\". Looking like an old saloon from the outside, the inside completely reveals its fine dining side with perfectly chosen lighting, tables, linens, plates, utensils, etc. And you might also be a bit surprised and thrilled with the music selection- 70s and 80s disco. If you're thinking stuffy French, it's quite the opposite. From the service, to the drinks and food, to the founder and manager taking time to talk with us and thank us for dining with them, it was all perfect. Congrats to Brandon and his staff, and their amazing mission."}
{"text":"This was a great surprise find.  The service was great.  Everything we ate was amazing - Moules et Frites, scallops,  and Coq au Vin.  Bananas Foster to end the meal.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 dined her for the first time this evening and we're delighted.  Having lived in Medina for 32 yrs. we've seen our share of eating establishments come & go and had dined in this building when it was previously owned.  The ambiance has been amped up and the lighting improved.  Our 84yo Aunt likes to be able to easily see her menus.  The cause behind this new venture is admirable and we plan on continuing to support this establishment.  And the food is absolutely delicious; my husband commented that it was probably the best meal he'd ever had in Medina!  Our waiter, Keith, was attentive but not obtrusive.  The lobster bisque was creamy, slightly peppery, and one of the best we've had.  Hubby had the mussels with frites and the ladies had the almond encrusted trout and both were flavorful, perfectly prepared & ample portions.  We shared a chocolate creme brûlée and chocolate cake with mouse, both delicious. I see this becoming our favorite go-to restaurant."}
