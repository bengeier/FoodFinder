{"text":"Bénédictines are great - ask and they customize add bacon etc. On busy days the staff can get overwhelmed but generally they are warm and welcoming. A safe bet for brunch not tried dinner."}
{"text":"I'm always on a lookout for new brunch places to visit on Saturday/Sunday mornings and I came across this little place. The restaurant has a cute original décor inside and a nice terrace outside. I was pleased that they have my favorite Eggs Benedict with salmon. The service is good and the food is great. The only downside is that the coffee is not included with your brunch and you have to pay for coffee in addition to your meal.  The portions are average, my Benedicts came with oven roasted potatoes (not super generous on potatoes) and some fruit. Nevertheless, the eggs and the sauce were up to my standards.  I'd say this is a nice new discovery I made and I would definitely go back there again for brunch."}
{"text":"Nous avons gouté à leur brunch durant leur début. Malheureusement, nous avons eu beaucoup d'attente pour le service des plats. Les assiettes étaient bien pleines. Mais le service beaucoup trop long environ 2h30 pour un brunch d'une table de 6 personnes."}
