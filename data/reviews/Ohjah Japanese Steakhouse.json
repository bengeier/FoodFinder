{"text":"This place was amazing. Don't get sucked into the \"it's better on the strip\" attitude. Had the Kobe beef and it was a lot cheaper than anywhere else."}
{"text":"Yan and Luis are the best servers here! Everything was amazing! Will definitely be coming back in the near future! Make sure you ask for them when you come in! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this place. Their Teppanaki is the same routine. Food is good, nothing write home about. Service is ok. Sushi is a decent quality if you get sashimi. Their rolls are subpar. Typical Japanese restaurant decor and feel. It's dark inside with large booths."}
{"text":"Best time I have ever had at a Japanese Steakhouse! Our chef was hilarious and the food was amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the sushi chef was amazing. Sit at the sushi bar for the full experience...he will even give you a lesson on knives as well as treat you to some organic green onion. Yum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place with an 830pm reservation. When we arrived a man seated us at the corner of a busy table, which we had no problem. The lady taking drink orders tells us we cannot sit in this spot incase a party of 4 shows up, we tell them we will just wait until another table becomes available and she gives us a ton of attitude. We go to the bar and wait ten min. and have a drink. The same man seats us at a new table, when I look over at our old seats two people are sitting in them. Immediate reaction was that this place is complete bullshit and they do not know how to treat people. We told the man how we felt and left directly. I would never step in this place and the people have no manners. WORST PLACE EVER!!!! DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"came here with my family, bad service the.server didnt understand me what im trying to ask her. food are ok my husband liked his rib my kids had the seafood tempura was ok but the tempura sauce are bland no flavor at all. my chicken katsu are so horrible dry and no taste... so we ask to go our food, she pack the food all backwards.. then leave the to go boxes in our table without a bag.. so we have to ask for a bag because obiously we cant carry all the food out well good experience there. we left unhappy and probly were not coming back there."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Food and service was outstanding!!! Have not been here  since it changed ownership and was remodeled. I was very impressed. Will be back soon! This is a must if you are looking for a Habachi/sushi spot.... this is the spot to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night for the first time and it was excellent. We eat sushi weekly and we wanted to try something different.  We received outstanding service as well as fresh sushi. By far, some of the best sushi we have eaten in months. We will take the forty minute drive there again. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi place! The staff is super nice along with the manager.   Sit at the sushi bar,  some of the best chefs in town.  Try the daily specials, always different and very tasty,  not the same old specials like all the other sushi places."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? First of all I came in with a group of 15 and they sat us at the bar while I waited for my party. The lovely bartender made us two drinks, a lemon drop and a dj shot. The host Cody kept the atmosphere poppin and the sake bombs coming. Jason provided an amazing dinner and a spectacular show. highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"For the past few years, I have been driving to Blue Diamond and Decatur location of Ohjah to have what I think is the best sushi in town with the friendliest servers in town.  Great sushi bar, great menu selection (perfect venue to meet a friend who doesn't do sushi as they have a great menu selection.  (Noodles, steak, teriyaki and even curry dishes).  Henderson has been missing out, so thanks to the proprietor for showing us the love and moving into the neighborhood. For this of you who remember the old \"Pumi\" establishment, the building has been completely renovated. It is completely different inside with all new decor, seating, lighting, etc. Definitely worth giving this place a shot if you haven't tried it before."}
{"text":"We sat at a table so can't speak to the hibachi grill. The place was packed but we still managed to be sat right away. Service was decent. Sushi rolls were fresh and yummy. Kids enjoyed the udon bowl. I don't know if I want to deal with the craziness of the amount of people in there every time I want sushi. I'd like to try the hibachi grills next."}
{"text":"Very innovative, fresh and yummy! The preparations are more than pretty; it is an art. Viewing them satisfied  my appetite :D. Chef honny's expertise is really impressive. All sashimi dishes are amazing. I would recommend halibut sashimi: cucumber wrapped with halibut and lemon sauce.Tuna sashimi; spring leaf wrapped with marinated tuna and garlic chip sauce, yellowtail sashimi: micr french fried (angel hair) wrapped with yellowtail and ninja sauce. Surf and turf: blue crab wrapped with thin sliced NY steak and ponzu sauce Ono: king crab meat wrapped with super white tuna and salmon sashimi: salmon  with truffle oil. The list goes on... The place is a must for sushi lovers. My hubby took me there i will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We tried the hibachi side of this resturant & Chef Andy was great! The basic hibachi was satisfying enough for me w/o the added meat options. $9 for soup, salad, stir fry veggies, fried rice or noodle & entertainment! Hubs had teryaki salmon which he loved but could have been bigger of course. Fun for kids too, be sure to purchase their Groupon."}
{"text":"Some of my family and I went to Ohjah's after my nieces graduation tonight. Absolutely Great! Jason served great food while putting on a superb performance. Personality Plus!!! We had a great time. The Sushi was also excellent and the waitress Nooni was Awesome! The bartender could definitely work on her personality, no smile, no interaction with myself and my sister's when we sat at the bar while waiting for our table. But, after thar, nothing but a great time was had by all. I would definitely recommend everyone request Jason,  you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place always fun and friendly. Lobster or kobe  beef and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went last nite. Was their soft opening. Same excellent service. Same excellent food. Their new restraunt is a little larger than their others. Ownership knows how to do it."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and FUN!  We went here on a double date night and honestly I didn't expect much from the outside... then you go in... and in further to the hibachi, the whole time while exchanging friendly greetings and waving with the employees, I love that!  I loved it all, seriously, and this is what our group had:  Soup, great flavor Salad, fresh chomp chomp Potstickers, tender, flavorful California rolls- nom nom  Then in hibachi we had these we all tried: noodles (wow, best flavor, almost sticky and savory!)  fried rice Steak/shrimp/chicken/scallops and WOW they all tasted amazing and were so tender they just fell apart in your mouth!  PLUS THE SHOW, and our great chef was a blast with his personality and skills! Noise level was loud at ours, quiet on one side of us, and average behind us Ãœ  Great for couples, families... anyone!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out yesterday for the first time with the hubby for his birthday and it was so worth it! We were seated in the corner which was perfect for a little privacy and we enjoyed the dimly lit atmosphere.  Food/drinks we ordered: 1. Tropical cloud cocktail - (citrus sake mixed with a mango puree) this drink was enjoyable with the dinner, it doesn't overpower your palate, and it was a refreshing, fruity treat.  2. Strawberry with boba - the smoothie was amazing and the boba was cooked to perfection! It was lychee flavored boba too, yum!  3. Kani nachos - (stir fried spicy crab topped with fresh avocado on top of fried wontons) WOW! Tried these bad boys out for our appetizer and holy hell were they amazing from the very first bite!! The only warning I have about this appetizer was that the crab was bunched up like a ball of spaghetti noodles and they were hard to bite through, I used my chopsticks to break it up lol. Other than that, it is a MUST TRY!  4. Ohjah boat - (sushi boat with your choice of 3 special rolls, 10 pieces of nigiri, 12 pieces of sashimi, and a bowl of seaweed salad) The nigiri and sashimi were chef's choices, but we got to choose our own rolls. *Dragon roll - (crab, cucumber, and shrimp tempura roll topped with eel (plus sauce) and avocado) *Spiderman roll - (soft shell crab & crab salad roll topped with with eel (plus sauce) and crunch) *Dynamite roll - (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and avocado roll deep fried topped with spicy mayo sauce)  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOAT WAS AMAZINGGG!!!   Our waitress offered dessert, but we politely declined, we were way too stuffed with all of the goodness! Each bite was consistent and kept getting better! This will definitely be our go-to spot from now on."}
{"text":"Came here for some soup and got a tempura entree and sukiyaki. Everything tasted really bland . We could not finish our food, it was so unsatisfying.  We were literally the only customers in the restaurant and the manager decides to make a business call in the booth next to us. He spent our entire dinner on the phone talking very loudly about their internet and tv package....  The only good part of our dinner was the tempura ice cream and our attentive server, who took very good care of us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my absolute favorites!! The food is consistently delicious, I go here once every two weeks with my best friend and we enjoy it every time. I've celebrated birthdays here and 2 graduations, such a fun environment every visit. I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Your normal run of the mill Hibachi grill/sushi. Four stars because the special 25.95 blue diamond special is a normal priced menu item."}
{"text":"always a great time at the sushi bar! the sushi chefs always knows the right thing to make to get us to try new and delicious treats. the seafood is always so tender and fresh and melts in your mouth. since the first visit they always make you feel like a regular!"}
{"text":"My family ate at Ohjah last night and it was AMAZING! We did the hibachi, with three kids, and our chef managed to keep them entertained enough for us to enjoy our meal. The waitress combined our orders to give us the best deal, when we didn't even see that as an option. We ordered a little bit of everything. The NY steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The scallops were amazing. My son had the shrimp, and of course the chef threw them into his mouth, which he found hilarious. The chef offered suggestions of sauces, and gave us extra because he thought it went well with the rice. The price was very reasonable. We fed a family of 5 for under $100. We were very impressed with the restaurant; the ambiance, the staff, & the value. We felt welcome, and we will be returning. Actually my kids have already started asking when we will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's clean, the staff are nice and helpful. The food is hit and tastes delicious. I definitely recommend this place. And the prices won't break the bank either. It has an authentic Japanese feel with Japanese liqueur."}
{"text":"Had the live lobster live abalone aji sashimi ,app chicken yakitory n\" fried wonton so yummy everything was good service always on point very good!!!chef Johnny is very good skill  chef ask for him he will take care of you very well"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and each time has been a great experience. The staff is so nice and make you feel like they are happy to have you there. The food is amazing, I have tried both the sushi and the cooking table. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the hibachi chef was excellent.  Highly recomend this place for great food and atmosphere.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was a really nice experience.  Our chef was excellent, just the right amount of enthusiasm for the environment.   I thought the food was really good, and we all ordered something different, all from the Hibachi menu.  Service was awesome, always there without being intrusive.  I may get this a little wrong on spellings but Chef was Saul and server Audrey  Prices were extremely reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Amazing went here for my sons birthday and they treated him great the food was great and the atmosphere is amazing highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ohjah Restaurant's for over a year 1/2 now and I have yet to be disappointed!!  They have the freshest seafood (sushi) and the most amazing hibachi around town.  I have been to many other famous Hibachi restaurants and by far Ohjah has the best tasting food and entertainment at half the price.  Their new rainbow location is just as amazing at their other locations!!  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Management and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Facility is immaculate. Food is great and reasonably priced. We enjoyed a Hibachi dinner. Our chef was engaging and accomplished. Food was cooked to perfection.  Had a wonderful second experience last evening 1/4. Once again the food was excellent and the service was outstanding. What a gem."}
{"text":"First time here at Ohjahs. We did the hibachi and between the three of us had the sea bass, filet mignon, and chicken, all of which were fantastic and not terribly expensive. There is no shortage of food as you wait for your entree as they bring out salad, soup, veggies, and fried rice beforehand. Great atmosphere and the waitress was very attentive. Best part was the hibachi chef...very skilled and had us laughing the whole time he was there. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"This was far better than Benihana. It's the same concept and dishes just at a cheaper price. The food is seasoned way more. It wasn't to busy so it made for a great atmosphere. We went to the Rainbow location and we were greeted with a smile by our hostess and everyone else we made eye contact with. Chef Ken was  A-Maaaaaaaa-Zing. He indulged in conversation as well as entertained. I was so excited to eat that I didn't take pictures. I would recommend that you order the 3 item hibachi instead of individually because you'll save a few bucks. Together we ordered the chicken, scallops, salmon, filet mignon and the shrimp. It was great. I went for a quick bite to eat with my daughter and since it was her birthday the waitress threw in desert. It would've gotten 5 stars but the portions were a tad to small for my liking. I WILL go back again. Thanks Ohjah for a GREAT meal!!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Great food. Friendly staff. I don't come here enough. I've got my whole family hooked on this place.   If you're looking for a nice Hibachi restaurant that may be close to you and has very reasonable prices, I highly recommend Ohjah.  It is a family friendly environment. I usually go to the location on Rainbow and Lake Mead, and haven't had the opportunity to try the other locations.  The only criticism I would have, is that their beer selection is limited."}
{"text":"same style as Benihana , chef cooking in front of u ,so good for birthday or all kind of partys ,but the price is lower !! and more options of the food , love there sushi toooo"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always went to the one in south Las Vegas & was happy to see this one opening closer to my house. We LOVE their sushi boat. It's a perfect combination of rolls and sushi that a couple can share and walk out full. The owners seem to be there every time I go and I love that. Very good with customer service."}
{"text":"Prices were a bit steep and I probably can't afford to go very often without a Groupon (although the price is comparable with many Vegas sushi places), but everything else was superb. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, the food came out promptly and was delicious, and the ambiance is beautiful. Definitely try the Kani Nachos - I would go back just for those!"}
{"text":"We came and had a wonderful meal and enjoyed our chef Chad. Very fun would recommend this place and ask for him."}
{"text":"Great, helpful & personal service. We recommend reservations. The food was very good. We are usually skeptical with Asian restaurants & were pleasantly surprised. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Extensive Japanese menu a la carte in addition to traditional Teppanyaki prepared before you at a large grill. Friendly service and while noisy at times with delighted guests at the Teppanyaki tables, always enjoyable.  This has become my favorite local restaurant which I frequent with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure at first since it's located in a strip mall but I was pleasantly surprised. Atmosphere inside was very nice. Staff very attentive and friendly. Food was terrific. We had a wide assortment of items. Sushi rolls... mine was the lobster. Sooo good. Hubby had the tonkatsu chicken, another had the short ribs. Everyone was very pleased with their meals. Presentation of the food was so pretty. We finished it off with some mango cheesecake and mochi icecream. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"NEW PLACE ! New open !! Everything clean and fresh !!! Price was not too expensive !! Still not busy so no waiting ! ( you know Hibachi grill always we have to wait other customer ) stuff was very friendly and kind !!! and ofcourse food taste yummy ! You should go try !!"}
{"text":"hibatchi was pretty good delicious. The chef did a litle show. Fun to watch anf yummy to eat"}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughter's birthday here. The chef was comical and cooked very well. We've been to other Japanese steakhouses in Vegas and this one was much better."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I have nothing negative to say about this place. All staff members are friendly and provides great customer service! The sushi's are amazing. My favorite is the king salmon!!!My husband and I always share the 3 rolls deal for $25 and my picky little eaters love the California rolls! Definitely a must try place if you're craving for sushi!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night. Was planning on getting there early but my date was late. Ended up there at 6:30 which is peek time without reservations. The guy at the door said he could still get us a seat at the hibachi table but it would be 10 to 15 minutes. In many places that means more then 15, but in this case it was more like 5 to 10. Decor was nice. The food was very good and the chef was very entertaining. We both got filet mignon and I added chicken to my order. The meat was tender and cooked to order. Only slight negative, I got  the cheesecake for desert and it was pretty small. One of the better hibachi restaurants I've been to. Price was very reasonable. I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Very innovative, fresh and yummy! The preparations are more than pretty; it is an art. Viewing them satisfied my appetite :D Chef Jonny's expertise is really impressive.  All sashimi dishes are amazing. I would recommend cucumber wrap with halibut, spring leaves wrapped with marinated tuna, micro French fries (Angel hair) wrapped with yellow tail, surf and turf (blue crab wrapped with thin sliced NY steak) , Ono (king crab meat wrapped with super white tuna) and salmon sashimi in Truffle oil. The list goes on.. The place is a must for sushi lovers. My hubby took me there I will definitely go back again !"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The salad was the best. I had the lobster. It was outstanding. I loved the entertainment from Chef. Definitely will be going back soon. My sister had the steak, it was great. The tempura vegtables were pretty good as well. Soon to be my niece's Birthday. Going to take her there. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Really excited this place opened near where I live. Also, very dangerous. This place is delicious! I'm not usually a fan of chain sushi restaurants, however, this one has proven to be the exception. I always get their sashimi. These sushi chefs know what they're doing. Their cuts of fish are amazing.  Fresh cuts of fish. I'm never disappointed. My husband gets rolls of sushi. Never heard a complaint out of him yet. I noticed they don't have a lot of rolls with fake crab which is awesome."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area. The hubby and I tried out this place. The food was delicious! The overall experience here was great, the staff was so attentive. We will definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Went in once cause I was craving sushi and had a great experience. Great customer service and sushi was really good. I liked it so much I went in the next day and i took my sister so she could try it and she loved it! I recommend this place! Very good sushi and place to eat!"}
{"text":"Bet sushi! Very fresh and always delicious. The hibachi tables are also great for people who do not like sushi. Love the deals they offer!"}
{"text":"Went here for date night it was awesome, staff was very friendly! We didn't know we needed to make a reservation but they say us at the bar to have a couple drinks and moved us to a hibachi table as soon as one opened up. Beautiful restaurant. I can't believe it took me so long to find. We're planning on coming back and bringing the family so they can experience the hibachi too!"}
{"text":"I watched this location transform over the Summer and recently saw a huge number of cars parked there the other night. We gave it a try on Christmas Eve and we were not disappointed. If you like the Benihana style of Hibachi Teppan grilled dinner, then this is the place to go. Excellent service and food. The staff was very gracious and our table chef was engaging. Also, the price is right compared to Benihana, with the same quality. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for someone to fill the void left by Pumi in this building several years ago. I was not disappointed. The decor has been upgraded and the restaurant is now all booths, except for the teppanyaki tables. I ate from the Chinese menu. The teriyaki salmon was huge in portion and perfectly cooked. It was a busy night, so service was a tad slow, but otherwise a great experience for me and my family."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this restaurant for a while now, had a lovely time. Had the Hibachi dinner. -Great food -Fantastic pricing -Attentive friendly staff One of the guests seated next to us we allergic to shellfish, which my friend and I ordered.  The Chef was very consciences about keeping the food separated and rinsing cooking utensils just in case of cross contamination.    Highly recommended for Hibachi. Will try regular menu on another trip."}
{"text":"Great experience in love the food. The atmosphere is extremely nice and the customer service is off the charts. I'm glad I found this place and definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious hibachi dinner, outstanding service, beautiful decor, and very fair prices. Don't think I have ever given a strip mall hibachi restaurant five stars, but this one deserves it"}
{"text":"My Husband and I had dinner here at the hibachi grill last Saturday night and we were more than impressed!  The interior is very nice and tastefully decorated.  The service was attentive and quick, the Manager came over to us several times to make sure everything was OK and the Chef was funny and talented.  The food was simply delicious, I had the NY steak and he had the scallops and we shared a crunch roll appetizer.  I also had a large Sake & he had a large Sapporo, total with 20% tip...$80.00!!!  We will be back again & again!!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out & also have dined in,  we've always been satisfied with the service & food. This is defintely our sushi go to."}
{"text":"I think this place is better then Benihana's by far don't hesitate to try this place out. And at a reasonable price u can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"It just ok.i ordered hibachi and some rolls.and the cook wasn't happy .he looks want to go home He didn't talk and as soon as he cooked,he disappeared.food was 4 stars but service was 2stars."}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun just me and my boyfriend at our table was a great 3 year anniversary dinner... the food was just okay ... not that great"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The chefs are very interactive and fun! Adrian was a great bartender. Great selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"Went here with my nieces and Chad did a great job at entertaining them. Food was great and the price can't be beat. Would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great place for small groups to have a good, not-too-expensive meal and a good time.  The chefs are absolutely entertaining (don't forget to tip) and the fried rice is incredible.  Having dinner prepared at your table never gets old for big kids, adult kids and small kids alike. I enjoyed fried rice, teriyaki chicken and salmon.  The meal is preceded by soup and salad (the salad is delish).  The meal is prepared and served with onions, mushrooms and zucchini.  My food was good and company was pretty cool.  Our table had a contest on who could catch the most flying shrimp with their mouth.  I didn't win, but the food is a winner."}
{"text":"Awesome night.  Our chef nick was great and went out of his way to entertain out two young girls!!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner at Ohjah and it was great. Service was on target and the food tasty. Our server was very nice and checked on us consistent.  Our drinks never hit the bottom. We sat at the table area and ordered the 3 roll special with appetizers.  Food came out fast and the rolls were tasty and presentation flawless. Gonna try the hibachi area on the next visit.  Didn't have any dessert cause was too full."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend to everyone. We had the Fresh Toro sashimi/Oyster half shell/Ohjah boat combo...everything tasted fresh. Price also very reasonable...service was outstanding! Waiter also brought over a sample of their Ahi belly...very delicious! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Try something new in our neighborhood,  pick the teppanyaki table and got the chef name Jason, I think he doesnt have good enough experience for cooking teppan, He put everything on the grill, seafood, steak, vegetable, and rice, all at the same time (no timely manner) (benihana chef cook all one by one, so you can enjoy your meal satisfactory, ps: dont get me wrong!!), bcause of that the result is all the taste is horrible, my rice smell fishy and raw meat,, horrible, same smell when you eat close to dumpster (pardon me).  And the fried rice is too dry, you can feel the dryness cause its hard to swallow, i saw the other people who sat at the same table cant finish the protein and the fried rice. I wish the owner pay more attention about the chef, the way Jason cook describe how poor the quality of  maintain the food for the customer!! One star is just for the ambience (they played 2105 pop music) I Dont think it will last longer if the owner still dont care about how the chef cook and let the chef work as what easy for them,Keep doing like this and it will closed down like the previous restaurant named Pumi."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Sushi or grill both are good. Catipillar roll is amazing. Sashimi is fresh."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience and food! I used a groupon, but will be coming back regularly with my husband! The food is decently priced and the chef we had was hilarious!  You will not be disappointed, go!!"}
{"text":"There are very few places that I would leave my comfortable home and my own cooking for and this is one of them. Clean, quite, courteous, and delicious food hits all my expectations for dining out."}
{"text":"This is a must go to spot whenever were in Vegas. Sushi never disapoints and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Placed an order through Doordash for some special rolls for me, an entree for my wife and a kids meal for my son.  I get a call from Doordash saying they refused to fulfill my order saying kids meals cannot be delivered and wanted me to pay 50% more for an adult entree of the same item.  If they do not allow take out of certain items why is their full menu listed on Doordash?  Cancelled my entire order and ordered from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food and fun for all!  High quality ingredients and friendly service.  We come here monthly at least.  Make a reservation if you want a hibachi table though."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Ohjah for dinner. So happy we did. We did the hibachi! The food was amazing. If you decide to go you have to have Jimmy as your cook! He was the best. What a great experience. As I looked around no one else was having as much fun as our table was. He made the experience more fun. Thank you Jimmy."}
{"text":"we love this place & we take our friends & family here that come to town.  the fillet mignon is so tender with a delicious flavor.  we always go on the hibachi side, the first thing you will notice is that the prices are extremely reasonable. The hibachi basic entree is $8.95 and comes with soup, salad, vegetables, and choice of rice (white or fried rice). You then get to choose the entree you want with it: * Chicken (5 oz) for $5.95 * Sukiyaki Beef (5 oz) for $6.45 * New York Steak (5 oz) for $7.25 * Filet Mignon (5 oz) for $8.55 * Kobe Beef (8 oz) for $48.95 * Shrimp Teppanyaki (3 oz) for $6.75 * Salmon Teriyaki (4 oz) for $6.75 * Scallop Teriyaki (5 oz) for $8.55 * Sole Fish Teriyaki (8 oz) for $7.95 * Calamari (7 oz) for $6.75 * Lobster Tail Teriyaki (6 oz) for $16.95"}
{"text":"We all came here with a group of 7 and Susan and Jason gave us the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LAUGHS WE EVER RECEIVED at a place like this. We came here with my friends mom to celebrate her birthday! She was so excited to come here she drives passed this place everyday & to hear her talk about this place everyday and come here and get this great service that we hoped for is amazing! We enjoyed the service so much we decided to sit here and write our yelps all together and send them in! Seriously thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great place. We had a great chef, I believe his name was Ramon. He made it so fun. It was my husbands birthday, and he made it a great time. We had excellent service and food. The SOB sushi was delicious. We definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for Sushi in town hands down! It also serves hibachi but I've never tried it. Definitely sit at the sushi bar and you'll be taken care of by their amazing chefs! Asia is AMAZING and makes your dinner an experience! Sunny is always great to us when we go too! You have to try the Garlic Tuna because it's the best in town! The fish is the freshest. Everything they prepare for you is prepared and served with finesse. Ask about the chefs specials when you go and you won't be let down! It's not AYCE but you will never leave hungry! You always leave full and satisfied! Ask for Asia when you go :) The lobster roll is worth every penny if your a lobster lover!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere but not too keen on the service. The girl couldn't get the orders right and brought us stuff we didn't ask for. The chef was great and very personable. Tepanyaki is always a great experience. The food was ok, not fantastic by any means. I'm not thinking we'll go back."}
{"text":"Great experience! We ordered off of the the Hibachi menu. It was great to see the food cooked right in front of us. The chef was very entertaining, juggling spatulas etc. He also put on an awesome fire show. Look for the smoking volcano! We are going to bring back our Grandchildren for the cooking show. The filet was very tender and cooked to perfection. The noodles and vegetables were very flavorful and tasty. The Sole fish was also very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  4,5 stars instead of 5 stars, due to order mix-up. (I honestly don't know how the chef keeps track of all of the orders)."}
{"text":"Ohjah has the best sushi. It's always fresh. I have been going here a couple times a month for about 8 months and they have never disappointed me. I haven't tried the hibachi yet but I will post an update once I do. The service is awesome. I recommend the special rolls combo it's only $25 for three rolls and they have a pretty wide selection."}
{"text":"We are so happy Ohjah took over this hibachi location. They are consistently excellent, whether you are having a hibachi meal or just sitting in the regular dining area. You are greeted with a friendly face as soon as you walk thru the door, seated immediately, and the service is fast and efficient. Management is doing an excellent job because all the employees are really consistently good, putting the customer experience first. The food is prepared with care, the presentation is impressive, and everything is delicious. We have been multiple times and will return many more. Thank you for coming to our neighborhood, Ohjah!"}
{"text":"It's so good. This is my second time here. I really love sushi. Today the tuna sososososo good. All the fish so fresh. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My inlaws took us here since we were in town visiting.  They have quite a menu with the hibachi, rolls, Japanese cuisines.  My husband ordered their beef short ribs and it just tasted like Kalbi from a Korean restaurant.  Portion was very small for dinner.  I ordered their Beef Sukiyaki and was surprised it was not served with rice.  Usually when you order sukiyaki, the beef is thinly sliced, but the cut they use is way too thick!  The beef ended up dry and not good.  Again, small portion size.  Service here was really lacking in my opinion.  They have a rating of 4.5 stars so I'm guessing we ordered the wrong kinda food!  If i ever go back, i'd skip their regular menu and get their rolls instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, Chad is the best hibachi chef that I have ever been served by. He includes the kids, keep the drinks flowing, and it's hilarious. Definitely will be back. A lot.   A huge plus is that it's not as expensive as the other hibachi places in town, and the portions are perfect, not too much food.   Sometimes hard to find a kid friendly places here in Vegas, but this was definitely one of them!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love hibachi, and we were up for a late lunch. Ohjah opens at 3, and we were first in the door, so there was a private hibachi room all for us. (Made us feel like celebrities!)  We started with an order of garlic edamame (delicious!) and each had a filet. Like most hibachi meals, we got soup and a salad as starters, with fried rice and grilled veggies as sides to the entree. Wasn't a big fan of the soup (a bit bland), and the salad was good but overdressed. I did like the fact that the veggies included broccoli; not a big broccoli fan, but I had never seen that before -- and it was really good!  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the hibachi chef was fun and chatty, even though we were his only customers. Our server kept our glasses filled, and we really felt welcome throughout the entire meal.  All of the staff -- from the greeter, to the server, to our chef -- were super friendly and attentive. Although the food wasn't the best hibachi meal I've ever had, it was tasty enough for a return trip, especially with such a great group of people preparing and serving it!"}
{"text":"OMG ... talk about a menu. It is HUGE ! I suggest reading it on-line before you go, in order to narrow down your selections. Seriously. We started out with the beef teriyaki and shrimp tempura appetizers. The tempura came with vegetables which I appreciated. The tempura was light and crisp. Very good. For dinner, I ordered the Gyu-Ishiyaki which was excellent. The garlic butter was superb on the rock before cooking the beef. My husband had the short ribs and they were delicious. He felt there should have been more meat on the bone, and I can't disagree, but the flavor was tremendous. Service was excellent and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service combined with outstanding food makes us come back here! I brought my family here from Canada and they loved everything about this restaurant. The staff is very friendly, the food comes out all in perfect time,  and the quality and taste is fabulous! Tonight my boyfriend and I enjoyed another supper and I had to write this review based on the consistency of my chosen star level...if there was a 10 rating I would of choose it!"}
{"text":"The neighborhood is kind of sketchy. So we went early no wait. SUSHI was Outstanding X2. Sushi chefs are professional with modern style, the old classics as well... Green tea cheesecake nice!  We will return for sure.... The secret code word is FRESH... My favorite OHJAH sushi bar crushes the one on Flamingo.... I approve this message JK KUHL..."}
{"text":"For Mother's Day my mom wanted to come here and we all feel in love the food was amazing and cook was amazing. I think the price is worth it. I would say they should stick with one theme it just seems all over the place."}
{"text":"Finally tried this gem!  Service was exceptional all around and I was pleasantly surprised at not only the better tasting meal but the affordability in comparison to other teppanyaki places in town.  After this visit I don't want to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat some Japanese steak food! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Walked into smiling faces & a helpful crew around 4:45pm, Friday.  It was the perfect timing because about thirty minutes later the restaurant was packed!  A huge flame from the hibachi grill on the right, a small bar on the left, a sushi bar in the far back & in between is the dining area.  Cozy atmosphere.     Adrienne, our great bartender, was a sweetheart & made my new concoction of a Cherry & Vanilla Vodka spritzer perfecto!  Cody, our server, was absolutely fantastic as well.  He took our order w/o writing it down & in between getting our hot sauce, he didn't forget a thing.  Friendly, courteous, patient, always smiling, like Adrienne & he knows the menu very well.  Brought everything out accordingly & thankfully my friend received coupons in the mail that he used.  One was a free Shrimp Tempura Roll & a Large Sake, both w/ the purchase of an entree.    My friend & I shared the Filet Mignon dinner that came w/ Miso Soup, salad, brown rice & veggies.  Our friend had the Shrimp Tempura dinner that also came w/ the same.  Our tender filet had a teriyaki sauce & the salad dressing was delish mmm!  The shrimp tempura batter was heavier than the usual, but next time I'll see if they could do it lighter.  Both dinners were very filling & large enough to share for the three of us!  I rarely do hibachi anymore unless it's a special occasion, but I will be back to try their sushi & if I do dinner will have to request Adrienne & Cody again.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"we went there for my son's birthday. we all had a great time.  my chicken was a little, thus no 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had another fantastic meal at our favorite Hibachi joint. The food is always amazing, the wait is short the staff is so friendly and tonight we had the best chef ever! He was super nice, talented and very, very funny and the kids loved him. Ask for Jason. Also, had a dessert here for the first time. Try the Mochi!"}
{"text":"I love this location!  This restaurant is clean and was beautiful!  Our chef was entertaining to the entire family.  The kids enjoyed his pranks.  The food was delicious!  Our experience here was fantastic.  We invited our cousin to join us for dinner and he never ate at a Hibachi style restaurant before.  He loved it!  The price for the food, quality, and taste of the food is excellent!  This is a place you must try!!"}
{"text":"We are so happy with our decision to finally check this place out tonight! From the quality of the food to the service, everything was excellent. Our server Cody left a great impression and made us feel welcomed from the start to the time we left. The chef who cooked for us and showed off his tricks was hilarious and Our food was cooked perfectly. my lychee sake was so yummy! And Don't forget to try the Mochi ice cream, mango and green tea were both great.  Thank you ohjah for such a great experience! Much better than Benihana with way better prices :P"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this is one of my favorite places!   My husband and I come here with our kids twice a month. We go to the Hibachi area and share the Ohjah dinner special ($31.95). It comes with your choice of three meats (excluding Kobe Beef and Lobster Tail), noodles or rice, veggies, soup, and salad. We get two Filet Mignons, a chicken, noodles, and we add a side of fried rice. The kids' meals are $11.95 and they get one meat, rice or noodles, veggies, soup, salad, and a drink!  Some cooks are more entertaining than others, that's for sure. Some even cook better, so the lack of consistency here can be pretty disappointing, but it's usually on point!   Their salad is DELICIOUS, and i'm not even a salad fan. It's just a basic mixed greens salad with onions and tomatoes, but their dressing is phenomenal. Their egg drop soup is also delicious, with yummy onion straws inside! And crispy noodles!  Then you get dinner and a show. You get to watch the chef cook in front of you, as he entertains you. They are really good about splitting up your food here. The servers are also really nice, and everyone is attentive to our kids. They make us feel welcomed!   Note, both my 4-year-old and my 6-month old were petrified during the fire part of the show. They have both gotten over it now, but once, they were kind enough to leave out the fire, because our son was hysterical! Lol. We love the show, and are glad that the kids can now enjoy it with us. But if you have younger kids, just be weary of that."}
{"text":"Have been here to eat several times and have wonderful service and good food each time. Have never had a bad sushi roll & the hibachi chef we had was great with my son, niece & nephew."}
{"text":"Great place for some sushi. They had a good selection of sake and the sushi was very fresh. The ninja roll was a crowd favorite."}
{"text":"The best japanese resturant in the town! awesome as usual! fresh food, aweson service ! Super busy sunday, so pitty we could not get Hibachi tables, this time tried dining table, warm service, amazing food, especially ohjah boat!"}
{"text":"Was there last Friday 1st and last time. If you want to feel like just a number that's your place talk about being rushed to order what you are going to eat seconds after being sat. Literally one server and one bartender. In the whole place.Horrible service our server did not deserve the tip that was automatically added to our check just because it was a party of 6+   I get it big party policy. But please treat your guests like you appreciate them. Food was okay and cook was friendly.  But I will never return. Just not worth my time and money."}
{"text":"This is the best place hands down for sushi. The chef's here Sonny and Forest are a great team abd a blast to watch."}
{"text":"Every Time I come here, the service is excellent.  Never had the Hibachi, the Sushi is why come here.  Sushi bar salad with Either Albacore, Yellow tail or Surf Clam.  My wife likes the Surf Clam as do I, but the Albacore is delicious.  Sashimi is reasonable for 6 pieces, Salmon is like butter, Halibut is very refreshing and crispy.  Uni is always fresh.  Ask Johnny to make you a surprise and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Ohjah just became my favorite Japanese steakhouse. The chef was entertaining and very skillful, I ordered the steak,shrimp and chicken combination snd everything was cooked to perfection. I use to be a regular customer at Ozaka but i have found a new home. Great service, great food, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Best steak I have had in a while.  And I love all the veggies!  It's great value for great food.  Such a relief from all the overpriced steakhouses in the area."}
{"text":"We went to Ohjah last night for my daughter's birthday and what a great experience. Best tepanyaki experience we have ever had! Our chef (wish I knew his name) was awesome. The show was perfect for our group and the food was AMAZING! I ordered the filet, shrimp and chicken, everything was cooked to perfection and the steak just melted in my mouth. The fried rice and vegetables had the perfect amount of garlic and seasoning, no additional soy sauce required. The servers were quick with drink refills and keeping the table clear of mess. Our waitress let my daughter pick her birthday dessert, which she loved. She got green tea Mochi and what a treat it was! So good. I would definitely recommend Ohjah to anyone and we will be returning anytime a craving for teppan hits!"}
{"text":"Chad-Man is the best!!!!! He was so entertaining and made the whole experience amazing from beginning to end! My friends and I enjoyed ourselves so much, we're going back tomorrow for my moms birthday!!! And yes we've requested CHAD-MAN!!!"}
{"text":"this place is beautiful.  we've been to the flamingo liction, as well. they are both great. so many choices! sushi bar, bar, restaurant or hibachi!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse although I didn't get to the steak. Sushi's and appetizer was too filling. Will need to go back and try the others. Service polite and quick. Restrooms clean. Ambience was relaxing."}
{"text":"My new hibachi place!!! It was so good and the chefs are talented artists and performers.  Usually you come to these places for the visuals, but honestly they give you everything here.  We got the steak and calamari... omg best calamari ever! And please tip your chef at the end! They don't get tipped unless you tip them personally."}
{"text":"Great food. However, don't even bother calling for anything. They don't answer their phone because they're too busy. Didn't know customer service only works in person."}
{"text":"Everything was actually really good until my friend and I ended up with food poisoning.  we had habachi with rice noodles shrimp and salmon"}
{"text":"Went here with boyfriend last night at his recommendation, trying to find a place that offered us variety 'cause we had different cravings.  Going in was good - the host was friendly, greeted and got to seat us right away 'cause we just wanted a table away from the teppanyaki area, and there was just the 2 of us. Once seated, our server introduced himself within 5 minutes and asked us if we wanted water while we looked over the menu, which was cool.  Only took us about 5 minutes to decide what we wanted from the menu, which were dinner entrees that came with soup, salad, and your choice of steamed or brown rice. 15 minutes after giving us our water though, the boyfriend was still looking around the restaurant, waiting for our server to surface so we could order. I remember my boyfriend making eye contact with a bartender, ready to flag her down so we could order, but she ended up just yelling for the server to check on us. Honestly wasn't too happy that it had to happen that way. When ordering I was pretty frank, but apparently hard to hear after repeating myself twice, so the boyfriend had to order for me. No biggie. Maybe the guy couldn't hear from the noise coming from the other room. The guy never checked on us, nor did anyone else until the appetizers came 20 minutes later though. Honestly wanted to order some Lychee Sake to ease my mood along with a water refill.  Anyway for appetizers, we ordered Seaweed Salad and Yakigyu (beef skewers). I ordered the Pork Katsu with brown rice, and the boyfriend ordered the Spicy Beef with steamed rice. The boyfriend seemed to like the salad. The beef skewers were decent - all the good flavor was with the sauce. Nothing special about the Pork Katsu until you drizzled the Katsu sauce all over it. The boyfriend said his dish wasn't spicy at all, but it was still decently flavored and cooked well. The menu said entrees came with soup and salad, but we never got those items. Was the salad supposed to be undressed 2 pieces of broccoli and 3 pieces of sliced carrots on my plate? Oh. Also had a plain puff pastry on the side. Couldn't finish the entree anyway because I was so frustrated that I could overlook the hunger I felt.  Going back to the customer service, before we got our appetizers, when I wanted to order more... I noticed how the restaurant or our server's area wasn't fully packed/busy, and how he tried to avoiding our table when checking on his other tables - he literally walked the long way to get to the table directly behind us several times. Observed this for the 20 minutes it took us to get the food after ordering. Also noticed how someone else had to take the appetizer plates away 'cause he was still avoiding our table for the most part. At that point, I'm just going to be as courteous as possible.  It got slightly better towards the end, when he asked us once how everything was going during our entree course. Thinking it was better 'cause the boyfriend managed to lighten my hangry mood. Not enough to make me overlook the entire experience as a whole though, and I think the boyfriend held that against the server - his tip honestly reflected it."}
{"text":"Food: We only tried the sushi but will be doing the teppanyaki next. So far the sushi's that we tried were real good. The appetizers that we ordered which are the tempura and soft shell crb were good. Soft Shell Crab is the whole crab.  Ambiance: Ohjah has three different locations we tried the one on Rainbow.  Service: Service was OK, however the waiter did not honor the $29.95 offer from yelp.   Overall: Would definitely come back for the teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Ohjah is great! I've had their hibachi before and it is super delicious, a fun experience, and a lot of food. However, this time we just sat in the regular dining area. I think there was only one server because she seemed a little frantic but everything came out just as ordered and didn't take too long. I got two rolls - the pink lady and the Japanese lasagna. They were both AMAZING!! There are also a lot of non sushi options so this is a great place to go if you want sushi but other people you are with don't like sushi. I highly recommend Ohjah."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this location and I always order the same item on the menu (combination Yakisoba) literally every time I order it (4 times) the price keeps going up it's went from $10-$14 the 4 times I been. The food is delicious but they try to finess you."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Mindy A on every aspect, with the exception that we had hibachi instead of sushi (we can't wait to go back for sushi!). We also live very close and used to go to Pumi, which had really gone downhill, so we were very apprehensive about trying out Ohjah. If you feel the same, PUT THAT TO REST! The place is gorgeous, the hibachi chef we had, Jason, was a hoot and we will ask for him every time now, the food was excellent and the prices even better! It was our family Valentines day dinner. The five of us ate to our hearts content, we ordered an extra order of scallops and an extra order of shrimp, 4 sapporos, a couple of sodas, and two desserts. The bill came to $150 bucks! You absolutely can't beat that for a hibachi dinner..that comes out to about $30 a person and included all the extras on VALENTINES DAY, when alot of restaurants charge higher rates. It's our new favorite place! See you there!"}
{"text":"Pricey food the food. Did not get full from the sushi. But the size of the in house meal was large and cant finish by your self. 4 of us and we spend about 130 avg price. The serive was nice we got a thai lady and she was nice. The food was avg japanese food."}
{"text":"I loved having dinner here. Sitting at the hibachi grill definitely makes it an experience to remember! The service was quick and we ate shortly after we arrived. Our chef Chad was funny and paid a lot of attention to the kids in our party. I ordered the New York steak and it came out perfectly cooked to my liking. I left full and didn't feel like ordering dessert, but I suggest getting strawberry or mango mochi! Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"Jason is the BOMB! Always super friendly staff and over the top fantastic service! The food is the freshest and the portions are great size. Request Jason as your hibachi cook and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent. To start off, the atmosphere is pretty nice and it is dim lighting. The restaurant is kept nice and tidy. The staff was welcoming and delightful. The group I was with did make reservations so there was no wait for us even though we were a bit late, they didn't make a big deal of it which was nice."}
{"text":"These guys are the best. It's my belief that this place has it hands-down over Benihana Restaurant. I have gone to the most expensive Teppanyaki Style places, and this place has my top honors. Best atmosphere, best service, best food, best portions and best prices for sure. Ive been to both the Rainbow Blvd site and the Pahrump site. Fantastic service! I was one of their very first customers and for that they gave my wife and I a $10-off Gift Card that is good for the next visit. We still always get that Gift Card back. Everytime. Its a great place to bring your family, you're not going to break the bank. The perfect place to bring a picky eater. Keep it up OhJah!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time, great food and great wine selection! Audrey was our server and she is the sweetest!"}
{"text":"I saw multiple reviews for #Jason and we were lucky enough to be at his table. He is entertaining, friendly, funny, oh and an amazing chef. First time at this location, Jason will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Was very very happy with the sushi experience here! I tend to find that when a restaurant doesn't specialise in only sushi (ie they do teppan as well) the quality suffers. But that was not the case here. I don't often do non-AYCE places as well, because the price difference doesn't seem enough to warrant the slight quality increase usually. But they have a special (Special Rolls Combo) that's pretty much 3 rolls for the price of 2 ($26), so that was a really good deal.  I ordered the Blue Diamond Roll, Snow White roll, and the Sweet Heart roll. I also ordered garlic albacore and yellowtail nigiri. Everything was very fresh and delicious.   Service was also good. They weren't busy at all, so our orders came out extremely fast. And she was pretty attentive to drink refills and such.   The only thing that was awkward was the size of the platters they brought the combos out on. Absolutely massive. There were three of us in a 4-top booth, and we could barely fit two platters of sushi on the table, let alone the third plate of teriyaki. We tried to combine plates quickly to get them to take one away, because it was actually claustrophobic.  Over all, had a really awesome time there and would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here when in town on vacation; had an extremely funny and entertaining grill host and the food was good too!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I had one of the best dining experiences with my family. The service was quick and on point. All the food from chicken to filet mignon to scallops to shrimp was fantastic. Our chef was very funny and made it fun for everyone around the grill. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and once again you can always rely on YELP to find amazing places like this one."}
{"text":"Awesome hibachi! Went here for a simple date night and loved it. Will Swilly was our chef and he did a great job and was entertaining. Go on a slower night if you want a better hibachi experience so you're not rushed. We had the filet which was worth the upgrade for the New York steak, shrimp and chicken. Everything was delicious. My husband got rice and I got the noodles so we could share and it was a great idea. We will definitely be back next time to try the sushi!"}
{"text":"The new banner \"OHJAH! Now Open!\" hanging out in front was calling my name. Cool, we have the popular Vegas sushi/ teppanyaki style steakhouse now here in Henderson.  Really nice, classy, contemporary, yet casual vibe. The staff greeting, will ask you where you prefer to sit. Hibachi area, sushi bar, or dining room.  Hibachi 411 So we chose to dine in this area. It takes up 40% of the place. There are 5 hibachi grills. Each seats 10 people. Busy late afternoon (the linner hour) had 3 grills with 3 chefs already.   -Menu- Requirement when you are sitting at these tables each person order the basic entree. It includes vegetables, house salad, onion soup, and your choice fried noodle or rice (steamed, fried, or brown) $8.95  Then you can choose your proteins: steak, chicken, seafood ..serving sizes are written next to each selection. Prices range for each selection $6.95 up to $48.95 for the Kobe Beef. So your average $ per person here if they order entree and 2 meats approx $26 per person.  The sushi and dinner menu is also available sitting here, but we opted just to have appetizers.  Our party had steak, chicken and fried rice.  Everything was good. Fresh, quality cut beef. Seasoned just right. Nothing salty at all. House salad had a nice ginger dressing.    The chef that worked our table was entertaining, skilled and engaged with each one of us. But I was his favorite, so I got more veggies and rice than anyone else..ha ha.  Service was awesome by everyone in here. Overall, really nice dining experience. We all want to come back and check out dining in the tatami rooms next.  Note: Not open for lunch ...They start dinner hour at 3pm.  Location  Pecos/Windmill in the builidng where Pumi used to be. Those who know the place,..it's totally different...Ohjah did a great job remodeling this space. A bunch of diners were already repeat customers from their Vegas location and was so happy about this place They like it more because it's bigger and much fancier. Im happy that Ohjah is now part of our neighborhood too!"}
{"text":"OhJah is actually pretty solid in both realm of sushi and hibachi. I have indulged in their hibachi offering once before and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. It always helps when the chef has a fun personality.  Our main reason for visiting Ohjah is actually their sushi. It is consistently fresh with a menu boasting something for everyone. My husband and I generally opt for the Ohjah boat (no AYCE here). It is just the right amount of food for about $50. The boat comes with several cuts of fresh nigiri, several cuts of delicious and fresh sashimi, and 3 signature rolls of your choice. The selection of rolls is vast and you can choose from something as simple and straight forward as a rainbow roll to something heavy and drenched in Yum sauce and cream cheese. We generally opt for the lighter options encompassing scallops and eel.  The service is always very friendly and if you are a regular they will remember you and your seating preference if you do have one.  Great place that I would recommend checking out at least once!"}
{"text":"Wow !!!!!!! This place is amazing. I wish I could give them more stars. I got there and sat at the bar. Best decision ever! Let me tell you. The sushi chefs are so funny and friendly we got soooo many laughs in. The waiters oh my goodness! So attentive and friendly honestly just some amazing service. The owner even spoke to us and joked around I don't know his name but  he was hilarious!  THE FOOD : yes yes yes!!!!!! The sushi is awesome. You must try the volcano roll, and the egg rolls with chicken. Dear god ... So good. I ordered tempura ice cream but they brought the wrong one out and I let them know. They were very upset about it and fixed the problem quickly and made it free of charge. So delicious and you can't beat the prices. I've never been so happy with a restaurant. YOU MUST GO!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to vegas and was craving some Japanese food. I know I can count on yelp for recommendations and this place was not an exception. I absolutely loved the food, the meat it's so tender, shout out to Jorge our tepan cook he was AWESOME! I enjoyed every minute of it, hilarious! I will definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at the flamingos location. My friend lives by this location and invited me out for a bday celebration. Well it started off great and Jason was entertaining. When it came down to the cooking it went down fast. A lady was vegetarian and kept advising him to not add egg in her rice and to use a separate utensil but he was drunk and kept forgetting. I'm not exaggerating he had like 4 sake bombs just at our table and he had a cup he kept drinking from. One of the other patrons actually commented on it and Jason said it was \"tea\" lol sure. But I digress. He was talking so much while making the rice he forgot about the vegetarian no egg in rice and my fiance and I noodles. he didn't even stir them once. he literally threw them on the grill and tossed them our plate a while after. they were dry, over cooked, and tasteless. I was livid as I could see where this was going. Hibachi isn't crazy expensive but it's not cheap either. I expect quality food at that price point. Anyways, I ask him to remake our noodles in a low tone and just so he could here. I wasn't trying to make a big deal but I wanted edible noodles. Well he made 3-4 lippy comments and by 3 or 4 I replied with an even more snippy response. I'm beyond irritated at this point. First he says while making my noodles that usually people tell him how they want their noodles in the beginning. Mind you there noodles expecting them to not be over cooled and have flavor shouldn't be deemed a preference more so a standard(this is what I was thinking but I didn't say it). Second time he puts the raw noodle on my plate and say this is how they come out. third thing, he makes a scene, while placing the noodles on my plate he says no one has ever said anything about . y noodles before and involves another patron at the table who was acknowledged as his friend. and start to pick at me as of I was being difficult. At this point I respond and advise the chef well I'm a regular at another location I know how noodles are suppose to taste and these aren't it. He made a couple more jabs. By the end he ordered like 3 more meats and looked around the table confused about who got what and started piling food on everyone's plate and to finish off the night you guessed it another sake bomb. He was obviously intoxicated. I will never go to this location again. I'm very upset I spent $90 on food I took home and threw away. The only salvageable food was the lobster and that was because I literally walked him through cooking it. I told him when to take it off and how much garlic n butter etc. Overall horrible experience. Maybe well most likely a different chief would have yielded a better experience."}
{"text":"I came here on Christmas and enjoyed the show and food. I did check in on yelp to get the discount but saw it was just for sushi and the price was the SAME as the menu (no special deal here). on the grill/show side, it was a nice performance. I enjoyed the salad, soup, got noodles with steak. Everything was good, the noodles and rice were a little under-done. Had a crunch and not from being on the grill.   Would I come back? Probably not because I am sure there are better places but the price was very affordable and there was a lot of food. Good starter place but nothing stood out."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Very important to come early because they fill up fast!  The first time I came I just had the sushi.  It was absolutely delicious!  The second time I came for the hibachi grill.  I was thoroughly entertained and my daughter loved the experience.  The food was delicious and tasty."}
{"text":"Yummy! Fun atmosphere for a birthday group! Make a reservation sometimes there is a wait."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The service is always quick. The manager, Dawson, and his staff are all so friendly and have amazing customer service! The food is delicious! One thing I always get is the combination fried rice. It's a huge portion so it's good for the whole table. Their sushi always tastes fresh as well"}
{"text":"Went here with friends while visiting Vegas. It was sooooo good!  The hibachi and sushi was delicious. The only reason I am rating 4 stars is because I really wanted a boba smoothie - and they ran out so I wasn't able to get one. Other than that would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on vacation.  Researched the best hibachi in Vegas, led us here.    We weren't impressed.  We are from NJ which has the best hibachi, this can't even compare.  To start, the service was rough.  The restaurant was empty, the hostess yelled at a server for seating us.  The server pretty much disappeared after serving drinks.  The chef was not entertaining at all.  Seemed like he didn't want to be there.  The food was okay, nothing I would return to.    The price was good though."}
{"text":"Service, quality and value made us regulars at this place. I have done business and family dinners here. Only had sushi though, not a big Hibachi fan, so cant vouch for that personally, although it always seems busy on that area of restaurant."}
{"text":"Looooove this place!!!! It's super underrated. I would have taken a pic but it was so good I ate it before I remembered! I would definitely recommend this place over Osaka or beni Hana's. I order the filet mignon (9.25) and the hibachi (8.95) which is really reasonable for hibachi. The cooks always put on a good show and are enthusiastic about it, so make sure to tip your chef when finishes his show! It's our new go to spot"}
{"text":"*** CAUTION FOOD POISONING *** I ate here for the first time yesterday night (1/10/17) and I was super excited. I had garlic edamame, cucumber and avocado rolls, and an order of the spicy chicken. This is the LAST time I will ever eat here, as I have been violently throwing up all night/morning long since I got back home. My best bet is that the spicy chicken was not thoroughly cooked. I shared the dish with my boyfriend and he also got sick as well. Beware eating any chicken products here, or anything that requires cooking of any kind. I have never been so sick from something that came from a semi-upscale restaurant before. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a most delicious dinner here at their tepanayaki table.  NY Steak and shrimp, wonderful foods and responsive service. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ohjah, OH YAH! The waitress was so friendly and provided great service and recommendations.  We ended up getting the Ohjah boat which was a little of everything on the sushi menu.  The presentation was stunning and the food was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went a week ago to try to dine-in at the hibachi, they sat me and my husband but they sat him in the walkway, my husband is a VETERAN and cant have too many people walking behind him because of his PTSD so i inform the manager of this and ask if we can sit in the corner of the table by the wall we know the workers will be sometimes back there but no constant customers walking by and their response to me was \" No you sit there or you leave\" So we left. So yesterday i decide let me do the take-out this time i call it in so i can pick it up so they aren't so rude but they messed that up too. I saw an order sitting bagged up as soon as i get there, they have me wait and pay i waited 10min i told them i have a service dog in the car i need to go, then the buss boy comes to the hostess and says this is her food. so i got cold food an attitude from the hostess. Will never be back!!!! 2 Strikes thats it for this place. If you are MILITARY i highly urge you NOT visit this place."}
{"text":"So far so good!! Sitting at the bar as the chefs are setting up for dinner rush, calm, quiet atmosphere with superb cleanliness. I have allowed the chef to pick my nigiri rolls and the look amazing!! Clean and neat placed on a warm plate with a quality garnishes. The first bite of my tuna roll was not outstanding. It was more perfectly arranged with taste not overpowering fishy but more refreshingly moist with a clever pinch of wasabi. WOW!! I can not even remember the name of this roll but it so fresh, I want to wander in the back and open a door to see if it's a doorway that will land you right on the fishermans boat!! I mean how can it be so fresh. The chef comes over and now says try this.. folks I believe I'm In Nigiri heaven. As I am finishing every morsel almost licking the plate I watch the senior chef walk a new chef the tricks of the trade.  I am in awe with the all around greatness of OHJAH STEAKHOUSE SUSHI&HIBACHI"}
{"text":"I luv this place so much!!!! Sashimi there are so fresh and the chef is very professional! A very nice place for friends to get together. 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"To bad they make you select a star!!! Made a reservation tonight at 9:30pm and the cook just started @ 10:45pm. An hour and 15 min wait, are u serious?!? Mind you this is after another group who sat down after us had their cook. I have ate at many places and this is my second bad experience here!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PARTICULAR OHJAH on rainbow and Lake mead!! I am totally shocked how you can receive such bad service in LV."}
{"text":"Wish I could eat here every night! The customer service is amazing! Food is amazing! We will surely be back!! The Habachi Chef was extremely talented, involved, made a fun show for us, and we had so much fun while eating. The food was so perfect in every way!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The only place I go to for sushi. Everything melts in your mouth and is prepared so perfectly. I only see Johnny for sushi. He is the master. I had to take pictures, everything is so indescribably good. Just go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything i order here is so good. They have lives lobster, abalone, sweet shrimp and all super yummy. Great deal on sushi rolls & combination and very reasonable price in hibachi menu also. Service is good."}
{"text":"Not much for Japanese but my wife likes it. This is walking distance. Great food and service. Gyoza light and cooked perfect. Tuna Takaki delicious.  Shrimp Tempura and veggies not greasy. Favorite was the Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar). 2 large Saki and on $59. I thought great value. We will walk over next time, I am stuffed."}
{"text":"Hibachi food was delicious and very reasonably priced! They deserve five stars for the service alone! Very attentive to their customers! Will be back to try the sushi soon!"}
{"text":"I've never been a big sushi fan however, my oldest son talked me intro trying it here. I've got to tell you, I tried the \" Las Vegas rolls\" and they were delicious! They were very busy the night we came for the first time and we could get a place in the hibachi so we decided to try again and we got a seat for hibachi.  Soup, salad and the main course (New York steak) with fried brown rice, on top of that a side of Las Vegas rolls. Dinner was excellent and for a decent price. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"2nd time stopping in. We had Chad Man as our chef he was awesome and very skilled. Delicious food good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I loved this place the food was good and the service was great.  Ken cooked our food and he was very fun. Great place for a  nice date or just a night out with your friends"}
{"text":"Despite the name and the focus on hibachi/teppan dishes, Ohjah has a pretty large sushi selection and some good combos. Note that their Yelp check-in offer for a $26 dinner special is the regular price on their menu, but one of my favorite things to get.   Out of the four sushi dinner special combos, I usually pick from the Special Rolls Combo (3 rolls) or the Blue Diamond Dinner Special (two rolls plus 4 pieces each chef choice sashimi and nigiri)- both are $26 and huge, shareable portions.  Favorite rolls include the Give Me a Break (spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado, Cajun tuna, garlic sauce) and the You and Me (tempura crab, salmon, cream cheese, tuna, superwhite tuna, fish eggs, eel sauce, and spicy mayo). They balance one another out well, with one being spicy while the other is more mild. Fish is fresh and generously cut, rolls aren't too rice-heavy.  Bonus star for offering 10% discount for LVAC members who show ID- this is even valid on takeout orders, which is typically what I get."}
{"text":"It would help if they served the menu that they have online, but they do not. As a beef negimaki fan that's quite a disappointment to me, and it's been that way for MONTHS. Otherwise the place seems rather ordinary."}
{"text":"Any & every time we go here the food is good. Love the entertainment as well! Such a good place!! I will forever be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is good. The hibachi is fantastic. Wish it was a little closer to home."}
{"text":"Such a great hibachi steakhouse! Chefs are always entertaining and personable. The salad and soup are awesome and the food quality is always consistent! Sometimes the wait isn't great but they accept reservations so that's a plus. Great place for large groups and special events!"}
{"text":"Very awesome...we ordered the hibachi steak with shrimp and garlic fried rice, Alaska king crab roll, and the Snow White roll! AMAZING food and GREAT service from Susan. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Previously I gave this restaurant 5 stars. Not anymore. Our last service was TERRIBLE. It was my mom's birthday and I felt so bad that we got such crappy service. The teppan cook didn't make the fried rice or the shrimp. He did a half a$$ job preparing the food. The server barely checked on us and he brought out my mom's birthday dessert when she was still eating dinner. We felt like a nuisance to the entire staff. We need to find a new teppan restaurant. So disappointing."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is due to the taste of the food. First of all, we had party of 6 so we called for reservations(@7). We arrived at 6:55 pm, and we waited until 7:45 for our table!!!!  Why make reservations if you have to wait anyway? Next when it was time for meal the food was prepared but he didn't make enough fired rice. So I opted to wait, as I was entertaining out of town guests. By now, don't you know how much to make? The lady that refilled my water was right on top of that. Food did taste great. Quick to bring check & receipt. So there's the 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. We've lived in Las Vegas almost six years and have yet to find a favorite place for Sushi, trying over fifteen places. This being the sixteenth. The restaurant was nice and clean with attentive customer service. Born and raised in Hawaii, then California, we never had problems finding good restaurants for any cuisine. We are spoiled by sushi in CA. At Ohjah's, I can't describe the food. Three sushi rolls. (No bento boxes.) We also ordered New York Steak (bland), and Chicken (bland) plate with soup, salad, vegetables (no flavor) and a choice of sides: Noodles, fried rice, brown rice but no white steamed rice, a tradition. Husband said it was good, though we probably won't be back. Our search continues. Next on the list is Sushi-ko on 95 and Craig."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. The first time ever in my life I have to say the word f* and sh* in public. It reached my limit. At 3pm, I called and made a reservation for a party of 7 people at 7:30pm, then at 5:30pm I called again and said if I could change the reservation time to be sooner. I was told that YES. We arrived there at 6:35pm and was confirmed by the MANAGER that he doesn't have a table for me at that time, but would try to get a table for us in 10 min. While we were waiting, the other waitress told us that there was a table should be finished soon. 20 min has passed. We came back inside and realized that that table was taken by another party. We asked and that MANAGER told me that sorry but I gotta wait another 30 min. He said that: \"i try my best to get the table for you, but because you called today to make reservation, while others had made reservations yesterday\" WOW, really????? If it's full, why did you accept the reservation?? Because you are greedy????? I really need a better explanation of how we are treated like that. I wanna say sorry to the owner if I had said the bad words in the restaurant, but sorry I couldn't hold myself anymore. I couldn't ever imagine I was treated like that. We didn't come to eat for free. We deserve a better treat. Also, when I told him that if you wanted us to wait another 30min, why didn't he tell us at first? And why the other waitress told us that we could get the table in 10'. His answer was: \" they don't know anything, they don't have the right to coordinate the table\". My little 11-year-old cousin responded: \" so why did you hire her if she doesn't know anything\". In short, don't come to this replace if you don't wanna feet refused for the service. I wish Yelp had the option for Zero star, because they don't even deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"I just recent moved to Vegas and this is the first restaurant I ate at, since then I try to come almost religiously twice a week. I can honesty say it's amazing! Great service. Excellent food, especially the nigiri, super fresh fish. (????)? I will for sure be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"For starters I would like to say that we did not eat at the Hibachi table we ate in regular dining. I have also lived in Japan for 4 years and know my Japanese food.    Just to let you know before you read.  This place is not an actual Japanese restaurant, at least when it comes to the regular dining.  They have Japanese dishes, but it more Chinese and Korean if anything. Most of the people I saw working there were Chinese. I did not see a single Japanese person which had me concerned about the food in the beginning.  For starters when we walked and was asked if we would like Hibachi or regular dining.  I said Hibachi, then the waiter left for a quick moment and came back with the manager.  The manager (older Chinese lady) said while walking to us no you can't sit in at the Hibachi table. I felt very disrespected at the tone of her voice. I asked her how long the wait would be she said 40 minutes.  I said regular dining was fine then.  We sat down and the service from then on was fine.  Now on to the food, We ordered Gyoza and Yakitori chicken for appetizers and my daughter (5yrs old) wanted the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  The Gyoza was deep fried which is fine, but had very little taste.  The Yakitori was 3 pieces of white meat chicken (it didn't specify it was white meat on the menu) on stick x3 and it was slightly dry and and no taste even with the sauce on it.  For a Japanese restaurant to serve white meat Yakitori is hard to find. Typically in Japanese culture it is dark meat chicken.  The Shrimp Tempura Udon The Shrimp comes on the side which the waitress told us.  The Shrimp Tempura was okay nothing to brag about.  The Udon noodles were overcooked and way too soft.  The Broth was very sweet, not salty or any meat taste for a Japanese broth.  When my I take my daughter to eat she eats all her noodles. She ate 4 bites and said she didn't want anymore. which has never happened.   I ordered the combination Yakisoba and White Tiger Sushi Roll. The Yakisoba came out and I saw instantly that the noodles used were chow mien noodles (a medium fat noodles) not actual a noodles used in Japanese Yakisoba (a skinny type noodle).  The Yakisoba was very sweet like the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  I couldn't finish it and asked the waitress to take it away.  They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else I told them no.  The White Tiger Roll was very small.  The roll was about 3/4 an inch High maybe.  I was very disappointed in the size of the rolls.  The fish was not fresh and they used a lot of spice to try and cover it up.  Overall I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I had to return part of my meal because the only thing Japanese about the dining area was the names on the menu.  Some things are priced too high for what they are, and the food was not good at all. The best thing I had, was the water."}
{"text":"Great Teppanyaki experience for my 11 year old son.  Yay for awesome charter school teachers!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for sushi I love all of their soft shell crab rolls, so good! I used to come here a lot more often when they first opened. But I noticed a few changes: 1 the Crab nachos used to come on a fried wonton, now they changed it to pringles... pringles really? I mean I get it, sometimes it would be a bit oily but it was delicious! Sad that's done with. 2 I loved! Their tom Kha kai, but this last visit found out they changed some of the menu and they no longer serve that, but curry now I believe. Very disappointing that was one of my favorites! 3 They don't play the music they used to play anymore! The whole place had this very good ambiance with the dimmed lights and the music just made it work. Now they play pop music or radio who knows. Felt like I was at Applebee's across the street, except still with the dimmed lights so the whole ambiance was off. Waiter was nice, but the buser seemed like she was in big hurry, would ask us if we needed anything before we could answer she'd just run off and bring us what she thought we needed, like water or boxes, even though we didn't need either, it was very odd since the area we were in was practically empty, may be they were busy in the other room? Still very strange kept seeing her running around like the place was packed but it wasn't..."}
{"text":"This is the second year we have gone on Valentine's Day. Although we have gone many other times. Great restaurant great food. Of course tonight was packed we had a reservation and sill had a bit of a wait but that is expected on a holiday where everyone goes out to dinner. Especially a place such as this. Although there was a wait and the staff was visibly stress it was to be expected but the service and food were the same as every other experience."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the people are very friendly I would recommend this to anyone if I could rate it more than a 5 stars I would"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place EVER :)  I should've written this review before I became a regular at this location but theyre still always my favorite.  The staff is extremely friendly and are always around if you need anything extra.   My favorite things on the menu so far have been the kamikaze roll, dragon roll, crunch roll (shrimp tempura and cream cheese), calamaro tempura, and gyoza (potstickers).   The chefs are always very fast in creating orders and they've never gotten an order wrong (for me at least).   Great place to go to that's right for the price. :)"}
{"text":"This was very good experience. Brought the kids and wife. The food was so good as well and the cook was very engaging."}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience at hibachi. Our cook was Chad-Man who was absolutely hilarious and completely engaged with the group. Our waitress Jenette was very attentive and sweet. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday last night. Had reservations for hibachi at 7. We showed up about 6:25 and figured we'd sit at bar and maybe try some sushi and a cocktail. The very friendly and enthusiastic host offered us two seats at the 6:30 table. I'm glad we did! We had a great hibachi chef & our server was all over it,never had to ask for a refill.  Had the filet mignon & a lobster tail my wife had the NY steak. All cooked to perfection. Was more than enough to eat & I saw some of the sushi plates and other dinners and everything looked great. Busy place so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and amazing service! This is my new favorite sushi place. Had the black Widow roll and the dynamite...both are highly recommended.  By far the freshest I have tasted here in Vegas. Dinner specials are decently priced and plenty of food for two."}
{"text":"I've been to Ohjah a few times and I have to say I'm disapppinted with their change of the kani nachos they are now served cold on plain pringles...seems like they opted for a cheaper option.  The Alaskan Crab roll wasn't bad but fell a little flat on flavor...the wow factor lacked for me. The Green Mussels AH-MAZING!!!! You have to try them...comes with a serving of 6 and packed with flavor.  I gave them 3 stars, for the small crowd on a Friday evening service was pretty slow and because our waitress spoke limited English we had to wait for the manager to assist her with our orders.  However, our waitress and the manager were very nice, welcoming and friendly. Our new appetizer of choice is the green mussels for sure!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our experience at the Ohjah on Rainbow about three weeks ago with our son, daughter-in-law and grandson from Dallas, TX. First, the china was not clean, then we ordered nigiri maguro; what we received was not-so-fresh yellowtail which we sent back.  The waiter insisted it was maguro, we knew better.  Our tempura was received with a chewy, uncooked coating which was also sent back.  During the dining, some cleaners were cleaning a nearby grill with heat and lemon juice which gave off an un-appetizing odor.  I asked them to stop. Overall appearance of the surroundings was unappetizing with doors open to the cleaning closet.  We weren't charged for the sushi and tempura.  We have had better experiences at this location before but this was an unbelievably bad experience with guests from out of town.  Can't believe it received a best of Las Vegas award!"}
{"text":"Late night Thursday dining done right!  Basically in town for three weeks and traveled from Nellis, AFB all the way to Ohjahs. Well worth it!   Ohjahs does an incredibly great job of ambiance, dÃ©cor, delicious food and fast service. Our waitress was prompt, efficient and courteous to all expectations. Food was scrumptious and timely. Left completely full and satisfied. Not anything negative to report other than the upper dÃ©cor wood beams had quite a bit of dust accumulated across all articles but don't let that discourage you for an outstanding eating establishment! Truly great experience and tasty to perfection. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi with a great deal for $24 you get to pick three specials rolls off an extensive menu. I never tried their habachi but I wpuld imagine its great. We literally go every friday. The service and atmosphere is great and what can I say we love the sushi and the price is very reasonable"}
{"text":"Came in right at opening at 3. Place was clean and the decor and ambiance were great. I ordered fried tofu and the hibachi. The fried tofu was disappointing--i love fried tofu. It had no flavor and even the sauce that was served with it tasted like nothing. The hibachi itself was good but again...didn't pop out as excellent. The hibachi filet mignon was good but it was kind of tough and dry."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best sushis I've ever had in my life. It was perfect to celebrate my parents' anniversary. You can sit near the hibachi or a booth. The waitress was really friendly and patient. She kept asking how the food was which made us feel great. We ordered the sushi boat with Holy Moly, the Cowboy, and Crunchy Roll. My favorite sashimi on the boat was the salmon.  Update: The hibachi was entertaining. Green tea tempura ice cream was awesome."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for our sons 9th birthday and had such a great time! Our hibatchi chef Jason was so much fun!! He kept our table laughing the whole night! Our son said he had such a fun night there. Delicious food and even better entertainment made the best birthday!!"}
{"text":"First ever to Ohjah and I can't believe I haven't been here before!! This place is super awesome and recommend coming with friends!"}
{"text":"Went last night. The food was okay. The chef we had did NO show.  It was very noticeable as the table behind us started at the same time.  Their chef was fun and engaging with the table.  I ordered my usual 3 combo with filet shrimp and scallops.  The order of the food was different than usual.  Normally it's rice vegetables them protein.  The scallops and chicken were out on very early.  Both were over cooked. The chef did not say a word the entire time he cooked.  When he arrived he asked the temp of the steak. He said NOTHING else until the shrimp toss. We come here very often.  Next time we will request and chef but the one we had last night.  I think his name was Ming.  If this was our first visit it would have been our last."}
{"text":"The cooked food was just okay.  The sushi that we ordered was average.  I would come back here for sushi but not sure I would order food from the dining room area.  Maybe from the hibachi/teppanyaki area the food would have more flavor, but the stuff we ordered was bland."}
{"text":"okay so i've been here twice..  it's okay. it makes not bad , it's not amazing.  deff someplace you come for a quick bite. the cooks are always friendly and make good conversation.  so far the best thing i've had from here is the shrimp tempura app & the sprite  i asked for my steak medium and i got almost well down"}
{"text":"For the amount of returaunts that offer hibachi , this one was one of my least favorites. We went here with a party of about 9... We had made a reservation ahead of time for about 6... Make sure every single person in your party arrives at the same time because they will not seat you until everyone is there. Sucked that someone from ours was running a half hour late. The waitress was a young girl with no personality at all... We were waiting for refills most of the night and any time we had asked her a question about the menu she wasn't very helpful just rude. The sushi boat is pretty cool , I just wish you could choose all the things u wanted instead of 3 of the items being chefs choice which is always the raw ones. The food was very good and flavorful, however 2 times during our hibachi meal someone had to wait because he was short on 1 fried rice for someone and then forgot my steak.. So I had to wait while everyone else because steak is cooked last. He had a great personality though . Maybe this place would do better with a smaller party, I will be sticking to Geisha House and Benihanas for now on though."}
{"text":"food excellent presentation awesome one of the best japanese steak houses. We ordered fillet mignon rare. Tender and rare  perfection. WIFE does not like garlic  No fuss no muss her whole meal garlic free. . But the rest of the table got garlic. Done by a pro. Great evening  ENJOY"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here, this place is amazing! The staff is always friendly, very attentive and the food is great."}
{"text":"Ohjah is the best hibachi restaurant in all of Vegas! They get you in quickly and the food is great! We love the filet mignon, shrimp, scallops, and calamari. The sushi here is great too! Our favorite cook is Gin! He cooks everything perfect! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. OUR Master Chefs name was Jason and this guy truly knows what he's doing. I went with my wife and two kids. And the kids had an amazing time, we all did. The food quality is outstanding probably one of the most tasteful foods I have eaten in a really really long time. I've been to restaurants similar to this in the past but the show Jason put on for us was awesome coupled with delicious food. Thanks for a great dinner and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves Benihanas so we decided to give this a try a few months and it has been one of our favorite restaurants ever since. The quantity and quality of food you get for the price is hard to beat. The servers are friendly, always on top of refills and always around to take care of your needs. Jason the hibachi chef is THE BEST! He's the reason I'll give this place 5 stars. The only complaint I have is sometimes our hibachi chef (differs almost every time now we call ahead to make sure Jason is available) is in a little bit of a bad mood which puts a damper on the meal but other than that, great place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Venny was a phenomenal waitress and everything was so fresh!!  The lobster roll was everything I expected and more!!  Tons of LOBSTER!!   Forrest and Sunny were awesome sushi Chefs and will give you the freshest sushi in town!!  This was my first visit here and I will definitely be back again!! Definitely recommended! A ++++"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Ohjah, we started with the Sashimi platter, not only the presentation was very good but the freshness & taste were up to par, for a main course I had the seafood curry,it was delicious, right degree of spiciness and full of shrimp, scallops & mussels. My wife had the teriyaki seafood platter, again a plate full of scallops, shrimp & a lobster tail, the taste was delicious. We'll definitely come back & tell our friends!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and hang out with friends, sushi was fresh. Best sushi I had in a long time. The bartender was also great making the best cocktails"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and love it! This past time we sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave us a cute little treat! My wife loved it! We both thought it was super touching and way above and beyond! Loved and love this place!"}
{"text":"I use to go to their other location on Blue Diamond when I lived in that area. I was a pretty good regular there, so I was really excited when I saw the signs for this location opening.   We finally got to try it last night! We didn't wait at all for a booth. All their tables look to be booths, unless they are different in the other part of the resturant. We don't care, but if you're not a fan of a booth you might be out of luck. The decor and set up are very similiar to their Blue Diamond location.   The main thing that I love about Ojhah is that they have a 3 Special Roll Combo for $25.95. It's perfect to share with some apps and an order of Sashimi. I like a good AYCE but man you're killing me, making me think I have the stomach of Gods to shove all that I can feeling I got my money's worth and ordering seperate rolls can get pretty dang expensive. So this is perfect for us. Maybe other sushi places have it but not the three we generally visit.  We had our usual sake, cold and fruity. They don't have the raspberry that we like so we got gold plum, which was ok. The BF loves the cucumber salad and we got garlic edamame. YUM! We usually get regular with salt. And we got an order of Sake Sashimi, salmon. And it was fresh and cold! Eww warm sashimi is never a good thing.   For our rolls we got the Kamikaze, crab and avocado roll with smoked salmon, yum yum sauce torched, eel sauce. Double Spice, spicy salmon and cucumber roll topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce and spicy mayo. And Spicy Mexican, spicy tuna and cucumber roll topped with shrimp, avocado and jalapeÃ±o sauce. (These descriptions are right from their online menu) All are so good and fresh! The spicy is not too spicy and has a nice flavor. They have alot of other good rolls that we've had on other visits. The thing I dislike is that I love a good creative roll that has fresh salmon that's NOT fired. But I manage and can find something that I like.   Their Yelp check in special is lame considering it is a special that I just spoke about that is on their menu. Meh!   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was beyond amazing! I can't stress enough how excellent the food and customer service was. Immediately upon opening the door we were greeted and seated right away. The host was very friendly and seated us in a nice private like table that wasn't too far from the Hibachi table. The restaurant was dimly lit and the the decor was great while the Jazz music soothed you.         This was my first experience eating at a Japanese Steakhouse and could barely pronounce most of the food on the menu. We couldn't have gotten a better waiter, Louis was awesome and by the end of the night my boyfriend was thanking him and shaking his hand lol.  He had outstanding customer service and was very knowledgable about the menu and even suggested items that he thought we would like. He did not disappoint! I can't even remember everything I had lol. I had the Alaskan King Crab Sushi Roll and Tempura Shrimp. While my boyfriend had the sautÃ©ed octopus and a bunch of other things. Sorry I forgot to take pics...I saw that food and just had to dive in. The prices were very reasonable and I am definitely going back...Groupon or not."}
{"text":"I just like the atmosphere and consistent food. My favorite location is in Green Valley. They aren't opened as long at this location but I enjoy that location better.  The sushi is always good and I like the griddle items."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! First time I came was for my birthday in 2014, and we went I to eat from the Hibachi grill.  I liked it then, but.......... Then I had the sushi! I am thrilled each time I go!   The host knows me, the servers know me, and the sushi chefs are fabulous!   I feel like NORM from cheers each time I go and I love it!   Of course, the sushi is amazing too!  The different spin on sashimi is great!  The rolls are great too!  So happy every time I go! Oh, and if you haven't tried the sake sangria, I highly recommend it!  Love the red.  They'll even let you sample it to make sure!  Thanks ohjah!!!!  See you soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. We tried their spicy California roll, reg Cali roll, Tuna fish tacos, chicken Thai curry, and some Kobe plum wine. The restaurant was cute and bigger than we expected. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Teriyaki Beef app, as it was dry and had a live ant crawling around the lettuce garnish. Service was good and the food was tasty. We might even got back if I can suppress to memory of the ant crawling on our appetizer."}
{"text":"Tonight I went really late to grab some dinner for one. Normally most hibachi places wont let you get hibachi unless you have 2 or more ppl but this was probably the best service I have had here yet. I met the manager Nathan who was super polite and a pleasure to talk to. The chef was really nice and talkative. This is one place I love going back to over and over."}
{"text":"There are 2 distinct reviews applicable here: the hibachi experience, and the sushi bar. The hibachi here is 4 stars in my book. It is my favorite place to go for hibachi. The ala carte entree ordering provides an opportunity to get great bang for your buck and good quality food. I enjoy the filet and scallops. The hibachi chefs and servers are great.   Unfortunately, the sushi bar experience warrants merely 1 star at best for a bad experience. Although one isolated bad experience would not necessarily result in a one star review, in this case, the same bad sushi bar experience happened 3 visits in a row. On each of the 3 occasions, my group placed a large order. The 1st time, 3 of us ordered a large sashimi platter in addition to other orders - we were served TWO large sashimi platters. Because this was the 1st time this happened, we agreed to pay for both, although we clarified only one had actually been ordered.   This exact same \"mistake\" or \"misunderstanding\" occurred again, and again, both of the next two times we sat at the sushi bar. Because of the 1st time when we were served 2 platters when only one had been ordered, then next 2 visits we made extra efforts to be clear we only placed one order for each item. Made no difference whatsoever. All 3 visits we were served TWO of whichever item was the most expensive from the list we ordered. All 3 times, it was the same guy making the \"mistake\". All 3 times he behaved as if that had never happened before, although we know with absolution that he had done exactly the same thing a week prior TO US.  Finally, the 3rd time they served us an additional plate we had not ordered, we refused it. Not only was this the 3rd and final straw, but that particular dish was not good at all. It was soggy in sauce and not fresh tasting or smelling. The sushi here is ok, not fantastic. Although they have an interesting Specials board, we were informed that the Chef would only make us an item from the Special Board if we sucked up to him, and then, only if he felt like doing so. And, apparently, he did not. This was the worst sushi experience I've had anywhere in 20 years. And I eat a lot of sushi. This was bad, in the exact same way, 3 times in a row.   So, in summary, the best part of this place is the hibachi experience. I would recommend literally ANY other place in town for sushi over this sushi bar."}
{"text":"Chad-man was a great chef. Polite servers. Food was delish. Will for sure go back. Have been to a few other locations around town and they're equally amazing."}
{"text":"Exquisitely crafted cuisine, alive with flavor. The atmosphere is just as rich as the food, as it too sings with the richness of an exotic culture.   Ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it did not disappoint. The portion is large enough for two, presentation was colorful and the flavors were stunning. Mom ordered one of their soups and that too was large, fragrant and soothing.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Went there and it usually is a great place and food is delicious. But the meat in the spicy chicken was dry and taste was not good. They did discount us 20% Next time il try something else. But the restaurant is Great!!!"}
{"text":"I heard one of our favorite hibachi chef  Van went to their new restaurant , we decided to go see him (actually we can not wait to eat his hibachi). New restaurant looks very fancy.When I saw the familiar manager,I could not help to give him a hug.Better service, delicious food as always. Although we need to drive more than thirty minutes away from our house, but  we still think it was worth. So I am writing this review to tell people who living in the surrounding areas of this fabulous place go try it.They have the best japannese food we've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant ever! The sushi is fresh, the price is affordable, and the servers are super polite! The setting of this restaurant is beautiful and culturally rich. It makes me feel like I'm actually in Japan. The hibachi grill is also super entertaining, but the regular seating is also very comforting as well. I come here almost every week now, and I find something new and amazing about this restaurant every day. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me this restaurant and I'm glad he did! This place is beautiful with good food and good service. I would definitely recommend to try the hibachi. I will go back and become a regular customer!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and there are a lot of options on the menu. The staff is friendly and the food is fresh. The volcano roll is my favorite along with their fried rice and noodles. I didn't care for the hot tea or the music they play sometimes but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"A surprisingly good experience. The wait staff is attentive without being overbearing, the food is tasty and well cooked, the pricing is very reasonable, it is very clean (bathrooms too!), and here's a real clincher: the kitchen staff actually have presentation skills and use them! The food has little designs in it and everything! I've never experienced this at a reasonably priced restaurant before! Will be gaining a repeat customer here."}
{"text":"Had some great rolls here but the Pink Lady was our favorite. Look forward to coming back, FYI the tempura ice cream is amazing"}
{"text":"When I walked in the first though was, \"where do I go? Is there a host or hostess?\"   Appearance of the place was well lit, and nicely decorated. A modern style that doesn't pressure the customer to think of a wrong environment.   Food, whoa...too much soy sauce used in all the hibachi dishes. It was the only flavor. Not unique in taste for Japanese cuisine. I've had Osaka hibachi in summerlin and this place doesn't compare.   Overall, the experience could have been better...  Oh as I right this I sit on the toilet, Ohjah food gave me the runs...."}
{"text":"Went there with seven adults and four kids. We had a whole table to ourself.  They start you out with soup and salad. They were both really good.  Then Out came Jason who was our chef for the evening.  We had a variety of food including shrimp salmon steak squid chicken and scallops.  All the food was awesome. The vegetables were amazing and the rice is as good as it gets for rice, LOL.  Jason put on a great show and was really good with the kids, plus he cooked some really good food.  They give you great portions for the price and we will definitely be returning.  Highly recommend the squid and shrimp."}
{"text":"The spot is awesome, and decently priced. I took my mom here and for a belated Mother's Day dinner. We both ordered shrimp tempura with veggies and it was quite good. The meal came with rice as well as a salad. Everything tasted great, the batter was nice and fresh the veggies were good as well as the shrimp. The service was very rapid. All in all it was a great experience and I'm sure they offer many great dishes. FYI , Be sure to check out the 25.95 sushi dinner special on Yelp you can send the discount straight to your phone."}
{"text":"My Wife and I went here for a date night. The staff was entertaining, friendly and attentive. Delicious food good prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Took the kids here for their first time hibachi. Awesome staff, excellent entertaining chef, great selection of sushi and the 3 for $25 sushi special was well worth it. Wonderful time from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Yeah, finally open, just tried this place last night, first impression when you enter is warm and inviting. (although they kinda overdid the Ohjah name on all the booth dividers) but that is easily overlooked due to the courteous wait staff, reasonable prices(even on alcoholic beverages) and delicious food. We will definitely be back often. (PS they have PBR on tap.....)"}
{"text":"Came in the other night and had a great dinner with the family.  This is my go-to spot for hibachi!  I also always order the garlic edamame and normally one sushi roll to go with my meal.  Food is always so fresh and never disappointed and normally have leftovers. Happy camper!  Will be back."}
{"text":"The front desk guy made this experience really crappy. I will drive.out of my way to come here.... but the food is really really good and the chef is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here. We had an awesome experience. The atmosphere was great. The service was excellent. Jason was our Hibachi chef and he was very good. He made us all laugh and cooked our food to perfection. We brought our 6 year old daughter and she loved it. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, however it was New Years Eve and that was to be expected. The food was wonderful and the staff was very friendly, we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in town! I'm a local and come here all the time. The sushi chefs used to work at Blue Ribbon Sushi at the Cosmopolitan, so you know the sushi is bomb, and they're so nice, they always give us a little something extra, like a free small new appetizer to try or a free mochi for dessert. One time I was cold and had goosebumps and they gave us a free hot sake! Super nice, super friendly, great rolls, great food."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good hibachi style restaurant since we moved here, this place does not disappoint! It was so good! The chef put on a great show while cooking, very entertaining and playful. I have been to several of these style of restaurants in LA and it is pretty comparable on price, but with better quality and showmanship than I have found prior. My son insisted that I write a five star review because it was just \"soooo good!\" As he kept saying! There's a couple different locations, so we look forward to trying the one closer to us as well. Highly recommend! Good for families, couples, and friends! Everyone will be thoroughly satisfied and entertained."}
{"text":"I want to thank yelp for helping me find this place, the food here is great the service, the ambiance and the best of all is that I don't have to drive downtown, I recommend this place to everyone you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"For Valentine's Day we made sure to have a reservation because we knew without one we wouldn't be able to be seated right away. It took 20 minutes to be seated with the reservation.  When we were seated we waited 30 minutes until we got drinks (we only ordered water with lemon) and then we're finally asked what we would like to order.  We waited another 40 minutes until we got salad and soup (soup was luke warm).  The group next to us were seated around the time when we got our soups/salads. They got their drinks immediately and their soups/salads before we were done with our soups/salads.  By the time we had our hibachi chef come to the table and cooked our rice and vegetables, the group next to us had their hibachi chef show up.  My vegetables were burnt slightly and so were the scallops. The other part of our meal was good. We ordered Boba smoothies as a dessert and they were out of Boba.  Disappointed with our waitress and the manager."}
{"text":"I felt like i was short changed on the amount of food that i was given, during the hibachi experience. The chef did not have enough food on the grill to accommodate everyone at the table. It was as if my self and my husband got what was left over after everyone else was served. I also had egg shells in my rice. The chef also short changed me on my scallops. Instead of giving me my scallops whole he cuts them up in half just so he can accommodate the other two people scallops. The other two people received full scallops that were not cut in half.This whole experience was very uncomfortable and disappointing.  The reason why I am giving this a 3 stars because the chef showmanship was great."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this Japanese restaurant.  The fillet mignon is outstanding & the service is exceptional.  The quality of meat is worth every penny.  We request the server LUIS, he always goes above and beyond. The manager NATHAN always checks in on us to make sure everything is great.  I was also reluctant to go in and dine, because the outside of the restaurant looks like a typical diner styled design, but the inside is decorated new/modern. The interior is also extremely clean.  My family & I plan to try the Hibachi grill next."}
{"text":"Awesome 3 roll special. Best sushi in Vegas. All the sushi chef's are fun and great at what they do. Couldn't be better."}
{"text":"We have lived in Vegas for about three months and we have gone to Oh Jah twice! Both experiences were great! The hibachi chefs are hilarious and know how to put on a great show.  They were also aware that we had our 7 month with us and made a small flame for him before making a bigger one, so the fire didnt scare him. I tried a roll each time and was not disappointed. I definitely recommend this place if looking for a fun moderately priced meal."}
{"text":"Our first time here & had a great experience at the hibachi side. Thank goodness we had a chef who was totally entertaining (I felt bad for people sitting at another table because their chef was borrriiinnngg)  The food was good & cooked exactly how we like it.  It's a must-try if you like good entertainment, good, reasonably priced food, and good service. Oh & try their Tokyo Bellini!"}
{"text":"Ohjah  Ok Ohajah, straight to the point. I am not a fan. Reason being, my chicken came out tasting like rubber and my entire meal came out luke warm, which leads me to believe, my meal which was the spicy chicken was precooked and preheated ? so not enjoyable! Ok so I try my partners who purchased the Thai chicken, same thing rubber every-other piece.  Siggghhhh moving on to the onion soup that came with the meal, onion what onion, flavor, where? Just tasteless.. the spicy California Roll, not a fan either. The entire Roll once again taste like it was premade, nothing fresh about it within the Roll. Now the plus side of Ohajah, my garlic edamame was perfect!!!! Warm, tons of flavor fresh!!! I would come to this location everyday for the garlic edamame it's pure perfection. The atmosphere is beautiful as well, the private dinning area is a neat addition to the large grills they have, this location also has a full bar with a area just for sushi , the prices are great and the   Meal size very large, I would share with two people. Well never the less, I am not a fan but I would come back for a drink from the bar and Edamame! During the lunch hour at a discounted rate."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm a huge fan of teppanyaki and this place seemed to come highly rated but I have to say I was slightly disappointed.  We got there on a Friday night with no reservations around 9:00 p.m. Surprisingly we were seated rather immediately.   We were sat with 2 other groups at a standard teppanyaki grill. First thing I noticed was great they try to fit more chairs at each table than is probably comfortable. I'm sure that's maximizing space. And I know it's like that in most places.  Second thing I noticed was the large menu. They do offer a lot of Chinese and Japanese dishes in their regular sit down menu. They have about a third of the restaurant set up for just normal sit down.   Third thing I noticed was how the menus for the teppanyaki was set up. You start off with an $8.95 starter set. Choice of fried rice, brown rice, fried noodles or white rice. Then you get a salad, onion soup (no onions) and grilled vegetable medley.   Then the other proteins are almost like sides and add ons. Everything you'd find in other places. Shrimp, scallops, lobster tail, filet, NY strip, and even Kobe beef for $48.95.  We added the filet for about $10. The chef walked out and started cooking. Asked everyone the basics like confirming orders and the how do you want your meat cooked.  Started off with the vegetable medley. Wasn't too impressed. Mainly broccoli. Something about broccoli on a grill just didn't taste right 2/5.  Second was the fried rice and everyone had and that lacked flavor. 2/5. For as cool as the show was, the flavor was lacking. More like fast food Chinese take out to be honest. Most other places use Gaelic butter. I think that's what's missing.  The soup came out and it had those fried Asian noodles in it that you'd get back in the 80s at Chinese family restaurants. Also lacked flavor 2/5.  Salad was ok. Not the standard ginger dressing but more like a thousand island 3/5.  The chef was good. Had us laughing.   Meat started next. No shrimp appetizer like most places. You can add that on if you want.  My filet was cooked good. I asked for it rare. It came rare. I've the cut a 4:5 but the mustard sauce and the ginger sauce were way too sweet. Couldn't use either for my filet. Ended up salt and peppering my steak.  Overall the place is clean, staff is friendly but I'd rather dish out the extra cash and make a trip out to Benihana."}
{"text":"Its so rare to find a place that has excellent food and service. Ohjah is one of those rare gems. The prices are decent, the service is top notch, and the food is awesome. Everything we have had here has been great. From appitizers, sushi, entrees, and hibachi this has become our favorite Japaneese resteraunt in Vegas hands down!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers! This place was Excellent with a capital E!  We made reservations for a party of 5 at a Hibachi table for my son's birthday. When we walked in we were greeted immediately. Everyone was so friendly and the ambience was great. We had an excellent chef! Totally can't remember his name! Regardless, we watched all the chefs and they all looked awesome. The food was even better! It was a little over a $100 for a party of five. Very reasonably priced. The whole Hibachi room sang happy birthday to my son and he got a complimentary dessert of fried bananas. We will definitely be back! Our kids said this is the best place they'd ever been!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and we got seated right away at one of the hibachi grills! The customer service was amazing as we got drinks right away and the standard onion soup and house salad that comes with the hibachi menu. I got both the steak and chicken and they were both to die for.  This is such a fun place to come with a group, date night, birthday party, or just want a fun night out. And a great way to meet new people. The chef was hilarious and was very involved with each group that was seated at our table. He made the night very fun and supplied a few laughs.   Overall the place was amazing and I thought the price was actually very affordable for a hibachi girl type of restaurant!"}
{"text":"4.5-5 STAR.  Ohjah should set up shop in the Bay Area, because we always have to fly back to Vegas when we miss this Japanese hibachi and sit-down restaurant. It's 10x better than Benihana, the ambience is terrific, and it's way more affordable as well.   We first found Ohjah back in 2010 when we lived in the Southwest part of town. There is a location off of Blue Diamond and Decatur. This location that I am doing a review for is the one on Lake Mead and Rainbow. Both locations are terrific! We definitely go for the hibachi side of the restaurant, although we have tried the normal restaurant menu, which is also amazing.   On the hibachi side, the first thing you will notice is that the prices are extremely reasonable. The hibachi basic entree is $8.95 and comes with soup, salad, vegetables, and choice of rice (white or fried rice). You then get to choose the entree you want with it:  * Chicken (5 oz) for $5.95 * Sukiyaki Beef (5 oz) for $6.45 * New York Steak (5 oz) for $7.25 * Filet Mignon (5 oz) for $8.55 * Kobe Beef (8 oz) for $48.95 * Shrimp Teppanyaki (3 oz) for $6.75 * Salmon Teriyaki (4 oz) for $6.75 * Scallop Teriyaki (5 oz) for $8.55 * Sole Fish Teriyaki (8 oz) for $7.95 * Calamari (7 oz) for $6.75 * Lobster Tail Teriyaki (6 oz) for $16.95  There is a special that you can get where you can get 3 entrees (excluding kobe beef, halibut, lobster tail, and live seafood) for about $30.95 per person. You save about $4-5 by doing this as opposed to ordering each separately. I always recommend getting the following items: filet mignon, scallop teriyaki, and sole fish teriyaki. The chicken can be hit or miss - sometimes they overcook it. But I recommend getting the filet mignon with a medium rare cooking. It is spectacular - the meat is extremely tender.   When we were at Ohjah recently, I got this special combo, and you can get TWO orders of filet mignon and the scallop teriyaki (which comes out to about $35 total). Then, my wife just ordered the chicken and we shared everything. That's how we strategized there. :)  Anyway, you don't HAVE to do hibachi, but it's what I definitely recommend if you go to Ohjah. In the normal restaurant, they have a full sushi bar and full sushi menu (nigiri, sashimi and rolls galore). They also serve sukiyaki (amazing), dinner plates for the traditional chicken/beef teriyaki, yakisoba, and udon. It's an unreal menu. This place blows Benihana out of the water - no joke. I wish they set up shop in San Jose. The next time we go to Ohjah, I will personally ask them to open a franchise closer to me."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese teppanyaki. Talented chefs and good tasting food. Prices were typical for teppanyaki.  Ambiance was nice. My filet mignon was done to my liking (rare).  Seafood was fresh. Enjoyed my spicy tuna rolls though I thought the rice was a little dry. Good customer service -- very responsive when we complained about the mochi ice cream being dried out and not fresh; guessing people aren't ordering dessert here. Would return for teppanyaki!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Ohjah last night and it was a great little place. We actually ended up here on accident. We parked in front of it, but went into Chile's. When we got there, there was a 20 minute wait and we were planning on going to a movie afterwards so we didn't want to have to rush through dinner. When we found that out, we decided to go back and try it out. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing and everyone there was very friendly. It was our first time so our waitress was very helpful with questions. We definitely plan on going back! We just did a normal dinner, but next time we want to check out their hibachi  grill. It seemed to be popular. They have a very large sushi menu, so if you enjoy sushi I would recommend checking it out. They have a good variety of food for everyone though, so it's a great option regardless."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our chef was even more amazing! Jospeh cooked the food to perfection and even gave the whole table a comedy show (He was very entertaining )! Overall great experience and would definitely recommend Ohjah to everyone! I wish I could have taken a picture of the food but I was enjoying my meal a tad too much. :)"}
{"text":"From the outside you won't think much of it, but walking inside we where greeted with friendly staff. The inside of this place is very clean and a lot larger than was expected. One side sushi bar and dine in, other was hibachi style. You can order hibachi on the dine in side which was great because that's what we got. Good portions, comes with salad, soup, entry, the salad was a little heavy on the dressing but was still tasty, I don't believe it was miso soup if it was, was just something different than what we where used to. The entry was good, chicken teriyaki had good flavor, lots of veggies and nicely cooked fried rice. I didn't see the option to have shrimp with it or some kind of combo plate though which would have been great. Service though was extremely well barely had an empty glass and very prompt on serving and pre busing the table."}
{"text":"ASK FOR KATIE! She has amazing timing and is on her A game. It's rare to find top tier service - not to mention the food here in really really good. Will be back 200%"}
{"text":"Always the absolute best customer service here and the quality of the sashimi is without comparison. Sushi Chef, David, never fails to exceed my expectations and I've been here at least 15 times. He really takes the time to pay attention to what you order and what you enjoy to provide guests with the best recommendations to suit each person's preferences. Also, the modern style sashimi is unlike anything I've had at any other sushi restaurant, which is why I fell in love here in the first place!! This is the only location that the modern sashimi menu is available at! 10 stars every time."}
{"text":"Great place, lots of fun.  Been there twice, once for the hibachi and once at the sushi bar and zero complaints both times.  Very entertaining hibachi chefs and lots of interesting sushi rolls.  Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and nice ambient lighting. Tastefully decorated and the food was simply delish! Our server was very attentive and friendly, and he made sure our water glasses and tea pot didn't go empty. I did notice, however, that their booths (although very comfortable), are barely wide enough for 2 people (on one side of course). There wasn't enough room to hold my purse and jacket (it was a cold night) and my jacket kept falling on the floor at my feet. Most booths have ample space for 2 people PLUS their belongings. But other than that, it was a great experience! We had previously dined at their Rainbow property, and it was equally good there too!"}
{"text":"This is where we celebrated Valentine's Day, as hubby wanted to eat here again after our great experience before.  He had the teriyaki filet mignon and I chose the seafood tempura. His meat was so very tender and delish, but sad to say that my tempura was a disappointment. Although freshly made and crispy, the dough was too thick for my liking and I had to discard about 75% of the dough from each morsel of seafood. I was expecting a light, airy tempura batter, so my choice was regrettable.  We also had the gyoza, California roll, and the tuna poke. Everything was just great, but I have to say that the poke was cut up into tiny, tiny pieces (pea-size, literally) and did not make for a very satisfying consumption of poke -- not to mention how scant the serving was in comparison to its high price.  Oh well, now we know better what NOT to order."}
{"text":"Best place to go in Las Vegas besides Benihana's. I love that it's close to my house and I take my family a few times a month, we always have great service and the food is absolutely amazing. I can't wait for my mother-in-law to come visit next month so we can take the family to OHajah. Hibachi Grill is our favorite place to sit and many  of the chefs are amazing and put on a good show. My favorite part is that they are very quick and food is served very fast."}
{"text":"Not great not bad , all in all a good experience place is a little bit loud but a good value for the money"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was ok. The waitstaff were busy and inattentive. Still its a good place to go and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Old school Japanese sushi bar & steakhouse  First time with a friend, He wanted to check it out The server Cody was very friendly and professional.  The service was fantastic! everything we ordered was amazing we started out with appetizers and main course was steak and it was incredible. I had toro sushi and a Pop n Roll it was great and beautiful to look at, Cody brought out everything in a timely manner and it was lovely, we had green tea ice cream for dessert very yummy,I would definitely go back enjoyed the service, enjoyed the food and everyone is so nice great little place in Vegas if you want great sushi and steak! Especially the steak!"}
{"text":"We always eat at the Ohjah Decatur....it's the best one. Recently, on 1/29/18 we tried the Ohjah Pecos in Henderson. It was below average in everything except the server. The guy cooking, plated both the fried rice and noodles on everyone's plate. We ordered individually because we all have a preference to what starch we like. Then the entrees we ordered we partially served to the other people sitting at the teppan table. Our party had 4 adults, 1 teen, and 1 baby (2 yrs old), but we always order more food. We ordered 6 entrees: 3 chicken, 1 steak, 1 lobster and 1 shrimp for all to share. Instead the guy cooking shared our three chicken with the other two parties at our table. We usually have left overs to take home, but this time we felt less than full when we left. Very disappointing, never experienced this at Ohjah Decautur. We'll never go back to Ohjah Pecos. ;("}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE restaurant. You will not be disappointed. Their hibachi steak is amazing (esp the fillet). YUM. Overall, just amazing staff and food!!!"}
{"text":"I was there couple of week ago at Rainbow Ohjah store. Johnny was serving for our group on that day,foods was fantastic and very delicious. He did outstanding job and amazing Chef. How can we imaging his ohmarkhaze by order by order each individual for each person. Food came out right away every minutes. We are having over nine dishes for each person and can not eat anymore. Thank you! Johnny, We hope to see you soon."}
{"text":"The only disappointment I have is that I did not come here sooner. I have not tried the steakhouse side but if it's anything like the bar side and the level of excellence as the sushi and appetizers I experienced at the bar I will not be disappointed especially with the friendly staff! The sashimi tasting combo was the best sashimi I've had requiring no soy sauce as it's flavor and aroma were a perfect match. I highly recommend this Japanese steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. We never have an issue getting a seat, which is great. Just a bit confused with the restaurant's rule about hibachi food outside of the hibachi table. Sometimes a person would like to be seated away from the noisy table and other dining guests, while still enjoying a meal."}
{"text":"My family went there for dinner Friday night, our chef ignored our side of the table, he did not really put on a good show (that's what we went there for) the experience. He wasn't even talking much. Especially with a table with 3 different families with children. The main concern here and reason I'm writing this is because he forgot our son's shrimp that we ordered. He still had the grill on cooking vegetables and he couldn't even bother to get some more fresh shrimp to cook up for him but instead he cut up the few pieces of shrimp he set aside on the grill to save for after so that he can toss it into people's mouths. He served those 4 pieces of shrimp to my 4 yr old son he forgot to serve, after it's been sitting on the grill. He did not even apologize and the manager seemed like he could care less. They did take off our son's meal off our bill but that is not the point. He could've handled that better. He managed to serve 11 other people and couldn't even serve our son after realizing HIS mistake. We are regulars at the flamingo location and never had a bad experience until now. This location has very bad customer service."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always delicious. The sushi and hibachi are both equally delicious which is rare but awesome. They also have the best chicken fried rice and chicken yakisoba. Right on par with the amazing food is the host and the service. They are friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Definitely one of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"Never did I think I would have to write a review about how a food establishment made me sick. Im more mad at myself because I should have known yet I still ate it. I'm never coming here again and I'll explain why. So last Thursday I came for dinner at 6:30 because I was going to watch Star Wars at the theater next door at 7:30. This place had good reviews so I stopped in and it was beautiful! The decor was nice and authentic the staff was friendly and the chefs even said hello. We were seated in a booth and ordered the teriyaki chicken and beef teriyaki. The presentation was beautiful I mean down to the placement. Our entrees came with a green salad and a soup. The salad dressing was amazing but they drenched my salad in it! Literally I finished all my salad and still had a large amount of dressing leftover in the bowl. The miso soup had great flavor but it had a weird little after taste to it. Now let's talk about what made me sick. My chicken teriyaki was THE MOST bland, cold, rubbery, tasted reheated, piece of chicken I have ever eaten. It had grill marks on it but I could tell it was NOT fresh. Imagine a piece of chicken that you grilled then kept in the fridge for a day then microwaved in a few days and left out for a bit. That's what this tasted like. I wish I was making this up. It didn't have any flavor no salt no seasoning absolutely nothing. I drenched it in teriyaki sauce to eat it. While I ate it I felt forced to take bites just to get something in my stomach but I stopped after a while. Why did I eat it and not send it back? 1. It was my first meal of the day and I was starving. 2. I was in a time crunch and didn't want to send it back because it would make me late for the movie. 3. I needed to eat in order to survive a 3 hr movie and didn't want to get food at the theater. I had someone else taste my chicken and they said it was the worst piece of chicken they ever had. Later that night at the movies I started to feel sick. When I got home I felt worse. I don't want to share what kind of sick I got because it's TMI but you can imagine. This place ruined chicken so bad for me I don't think I can ever eat another chicken teriyaki plate without gagging. Also the other person I was with said their beef was cold and tasteless while they were eating it. I don't know what went wrong, maybe they were in a hurry and didn't feel the need to make a fresh piece of chicken but that's something I would expect at McDonald's and not a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"We went as a large group on New Year's Eve. The food was good. Our cook was excellent. We had a great time for a fair price."}
{"text":"Came in for a birthday dinner. Very poor service and cooking. I ordered the shrimp meal. The cook was absolutely horrible. No show like the last time we were here. All he did was poop food on the grill and cook it. He did talk with us but only said how important his customers were. So I the food. Every egg he broke had egg shell in it and he mixed it into the fried rice. Then he kept adding oil, oil, and more oil. No season at all. The rice was brown but only from over cooking it and burning all the oil in it. When I took a bite it tasted of oil and I was so pleased to get some broken egg shell. I set the bowl right back in the grill and said something to the cook. I got no answer. On to the shrimp. I got 5 pieces of shrimp in my meal.?and it was loaded down with oil. Thank good ness for the sauce on the side. It took away some of the oil taste. Buy wait, I didn't get any vegetables when the other did. When I said something he asked for some vegetables from the back. Again drilling with oil and even after I asked him not to use so much. So my 5 pieces of shrimp cost me $19.00. Almost $4 a shrimp. Expensive dinner. I didn't eat the rice or vegetables. Not one person in that resteraunt asked about the meal or why I left the food there.  I don't recommend this place anymore. And if you get the chef with the orange camo hat run for the hills."}
{"text":"We like it here. Tried both hibachi and sushi. The staff is professional and food is good. Never had issues."}
{"text":"I really like it. It's my first time. The food good, service is good. And my server give me a really good recommend about sake. I will back."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were looking for somewhere good to eat in the area. I yelped and found this place. The cook was very fun and entertained the entire table. The food was great. We didn't have any complaints. I ordered the chicken and he ordered the steak and shrimp. We would return."}
{"text":"Been here at least 100 times! We always celebrate birthdays and any occasion honestly! All the hibachi chefs are awesome and hilarious! I have yet to go there and be disappointed! This is our go to place and will continually come back!"}
{"text":"I will admit the food was pretty good. But, I have never felt more rushed to eat. We arrived at the restaurant around 8pm and it was NOT busy. Our server was very quick to try and get our order, and we were not AT ALL ready. So we quickly decided on what to order.  Our soup, salad and appetizers were all delivered at the same time, which made us feel rushed once again.  The hibachi chef came over to our table shortly after and made our food to perfection. (Best part of the experience) We were barely In the middle of our meal when the server dropped our check without even asking whether or not we would like another drink or dessert.  I think the worst part of the whole experience was when 5 buss boys & a manager hovered over our table waiting for us to get up.  I confronted the manager about feeling rushed, he said \"we are very busy\" I looked around to see Nobody waiting... hummm. This was not a good experience what so ever!"}
{"text":"First off the positives: nice atmosphere, friendly staff and well stacked bar and nice wine/beer/cocktail menu. I've been here about 4 times and every sushi dish and roll I've ordered has been very good to excellent. The not so good news: So far every dish Ive had not sushi related has been mediocre to poor. Once I had a noodle dish that was obviously made the day before and reheated. It was sticky, clumped together and tasteless. Tonight I had a fired won ton appitaizer. At first glance it looked nice, but then I noticed the lettuce it was served on was wilted and brown. If the won tons were good I won't not have cared, but they were so bad I couldn't eat them. The cream cheese inside was cold and pasty while the won ton themselves were tough as shoe leather. Again obviously made the day before and heated up and served. This place has so much potential, but the corners they are cutting is going to make people stop coming here. I may come again for the sushi, but Ill never order anything else here."}
{"text":"Great experience here. They put you in a separate room away from others that didn't want hibachi. They have a great wait staff that kept coming in and checking on you. Also with dinner you got to pick a protein and a starch, and both are extremely reasonably priced. With that though you also get a soup and salad. Delicious sake and the hibachi grill show was amazing. I don't remember the chefs name but he had us laughing and made the show great. Definitely love this place, I will be back for sure with more friends!!!"}
{"text":"We visited Ohjah on our Groupon mission and were pleasantly surprised with overall value and quality of the meal.   We decided not to go with the hibachi grill as all members of the party has to opt for the grill.   However I am a sucker for the hibachi grill fried rice. I dont know it is - probably the child hood visits to Benihana and the buttery goodness seeping from the rice.  But Ohjah provides a more affordable experience of what you can get from Benihana.  The fried rice was perfect with huge chunks of chicken, not over cooked.  We ordered the sashimi combo which came with 20 pieces.  This was such a bargain.  5 pieces of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, garlic tuna, and super white tuna.  The pieces were gigantic, fresh and for $23 was worth it.  We'll be back for their hibachi.  There s no real big specialty items that i saw but overall everything was cooked to perfection and we were provided with great service - will be back to one of their many locations in vegas."}
{"text":"We normally love the food a Ohjah. We normally go to a different location and decided to try this one for a change. It was their anniversary and we ordered Sushi the rules were very big had a lot of rice tasted very fishy. It wasn't fresh.  very disappointing for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I love this place, the customer service is excellent, I recommend visiting Ohjah for its great food and experience that fits any budget."}
{"text":"We walked in and we're greeted immediately but we're confused because their front door leads to a sushi restaurant with no hibachi tables present. Looking confused, the hostess then asked us what we are here for sushi or hibachi.  There was only two of us and three hibachi stations with about 10 seats for each. The lady then placed us at some seats off to the side of the hibachi table where this was our first time, we wanted the full experience and she said \"is this ok?\" And we said is it ok if we sit in the front and she said \"no we can't because we have a large party of 7 people and they need to sit together\". So other than us not be accommodated, the prices were really reasonable. $5 for a glass of wine that was shockingly really really good. We walked out of there each paying $25 and getting wine, a full meal and dessert.  For the meal you can choose between fried rice or noodles and you get a side salad and soup and then you pick your entree (shrimp, beef, Kobe beef, chicken) and get a side of vegetables too.   I had the mango cheesecake that was really good but tiny."}
{"text":"Fantastic food  with friendly service. My family took me for Mother's Day dinner it was awesome . I had the New York steak teriyaki , my hubby the salmon teriyaki and my daughter had seafood udon. For appetizers we had toro sashimi , blue fin sashimi , agadashi tofu and a gangnam roll. Everything was delicious. I had Fuji apple sake (too die for), my daughter had a Mocha boba smoothie yummy! Great place to take friends and family. The decor is lovely very serene and conducive to getting your nom on!  We will be back! Cant wait to try the rest of what Ohjah has to offer!"}
{"text":"Best Hibachi in town! Service/food/experience is always the best! We've been there near closing time, during the busiest dinner hour, on the weekends, during the week, we've always experienced the same great quality! We usually dont have to wait very long either. The pricing is excellent as well! We will always recommend this place to anyone and everyone! :)"}
{"text":"First time here for 702dentist.com Christmas party. Nick was not only an awesome chef, but a lot of fun and a great entertainer. We will definitely come back and bring our girls too for the cool experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Across the street from h I best in the west shopping center so it's not that hard I fundm pretty good deal for the California Rolls. 8 for like 6 or 7 bucks"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious,  we sat at the hibachi tables and had a great cook. While doing his show a little oil splashed from the top and hit me in the eye which is going to happen sometimes they are cooking right in front of you... Just as if you were cooking in oil at home. I understood and said no big deal. The cook, server and manager were so worried I was ok which was so awesome I explained it happens and it's ok. They came over when it was time to pay the bill and gave us 20% off (which was not necessary) but they wanted to let us know they were sorry. Then on our way out they handed me an envelope with a gift card in it... To say the least from the cook to server to management they were absolutely amazing. We will definitely be back for the food and the simple fact not all management knows how to do business but this one definitely did.   Thank you so much for the experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"In general, I'm not a huge hibachi fan. Of the few places we've tried, the quality of food and level of service just doesn't justify the price. Our last venture to Geisha House (which is terrible in my opinion) a while back had turned me off on seeking out other similar restaurants. But when some friends invited us out to Ohjah on two separate occasions, I think I may have had a slight change of heart.  This Ohjah location, which is one of three in town, is located on Rainbow & Lake Mead directly across from the Best In The West shopping center. Inside, you'll find a very typical hibachi setup. Aside from an area with booths for those who want to do maybe just sushi only, there's an entirely separate room setup exclusively for hibachi. It's basic, but it's nice, and they keep it extremely clean.  The menu here is quite extensive. Besides the hibachi dinners, they have offer a ton of different stuff. They've got everything from entrees and bowls, to a long list of rolls and other sushi types, even a handful of Thai dishes. I was to surprised to see they even offer boba drinks as well.  If you are going for hibachi though, they do require that everyone in your party order from that menu. The basic setup is about $9, but includes a soup of your choice, salad and then grilled veggies and your choice of noodles, or one of a few different rice styles. Meat add ons run anywhere from just over $6 for chicken, all the way up to nearly $50 for Kobe beef. You're also able to mix and match if you want multiple items, or to add on seafood, like salmon, scallops, lobster, shrimp, etc. It's basically limitless and there's options for really anyone.   I've now tried their chicken, steak and scallops alongside fried rice. The rice was cooked very well, but I'm not a fan of the way they serve everything. First you get rice, then veggies, and then finally your meet. The rice and veggies are bound to start getting cold before the meat comes, but it is what it is. All the add-ons I tried have been fairly decent with the scallops surprisingly being my favorite. They were seared well, and not overdone. Both the chicken and steak were just above average, but nothing that stands out as excellent.  I also have ordered a couple different types of nigiri and have been mostly unimpressed. The garlic tuna was way overpowered and the hamachi didn't appear to be very fresh. They aren't bad for the price though, and I have to give the chef credit for putting together a special avocado nigiri for the misses who hates seafood.   Of course, with hibachi, it's all about the chef and the experience. We've had Tony & Nick, who are both excellent! They are very interactive and do some really clever things while they work. I love that they get the youngins involved in the fun too. It's much appreciated and so fun to watch. And I mean c'mon, how can you not have fun while trying to catch flying shrimp with your mouth?    The servers are also very friendly, and really stay on top of everything. Glasses barely get half full before someones there to refill, and they just downright do a good job.   It can get pricey here quickly, but Ohjah is a solid 3.5 stars when it comes to the food. With excellent service and a memorable experience though, I'm rounding it up to a 4. They're definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place. We are seafood lovers and sushi lovers as well. Great place to have a nice date/dinner with your significant other."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I had the spicy steak but wasn't spicy at all. The service could be better, I should point out first Everyone was very friendly. First We ordered appetizers one of them being chicken and they brought us beef instead (It was still very good) they also brought all our meals separately, first we got one meal and appetizer then another meal, then another meal and a appetizer, then a appetizer and finally we got the last meal. So my complaint is we didn't get the appetizers before the meals and the first person meal was brought out atleast 10 min before the last meal brought out."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this location 3 stars - the food is excellent, but the waitstaff leaves something to be desired. My daughter and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night. We sat in the main dining, not hibachi, and the restaurant was nearly empty. Once seated, it took our waitress 15 minutes to come to the table and take our drink order. Another 15 minutes later, drinks were delivered and food order was taken. It was still another 30 minutes before we got food (not what we are used to based on our experiences at the Decatur/Blue Diamond location).  We are dining on the hibachi side tonight, so I'm hoping our experience is better."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service and food, food lacked flavor, and took forever to get a simple refill. Maybe I expected more for a place that serves hibachi style, to be honest not worth the price it's not expensive but for the price I could have eaten and so many other delicious places, such as goyemon, monta, hell even samurai sams was better. If you go there don't set you expectations high, from a person who is not a stranger to Asian cuisine I was just disappointed like I said"}
{"text":"We had a chef named Chad that was amazing! Food was phenomenal and Chad made the whole meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time here, and every time I've gotten awesome service! Such nice people, and the food is awesome and reasonably priced. It's always kinda empty, idk why. I love this place! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The customer service is always great the food never takes too long and the price is just right!  They have a 3 roll special for $25 which is great considering most of the rolls are around $12ish! This is definitely my favorite sushi place in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've read the good reviews and we were looking to try a new spot near home on a Friday evening.  We had originally made reservations at Ichiza in Chinatown but realized that we had the $40 Groupon for Ohjah and changed our plans.  The location is convenient but not one that we normally visit for good food.  We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in and found such a nicely designed restaurant.   We walked passed the main dining room and sushi bar, and we entered into a packed hibachi dining room.    The service was incredible.  Our group ordered some sushi for starters, the Filet Mignon with some shrimp for our hibachi entrees, and all the food was really good.  The only real disappointment was the \"show\" aspect of the hibachi chef.  We've had better, but our guy wasn't bad.  He gave his best effort and our group was entertained.  It looked like there were other chefs who were more entertaining and engaged with their tables.    The food was great, the service was superb, and we will be back.  I think Ohjah is the best in town for teppenyaki, and based on the pack group in the dining room, I think others agree."}
{"text":"The wait is over. The 5th Ohjah finally opened in Henderson.  A huge Ohjah sign is out at Pecos and Windmill so you won't miss it from either way.  Looks like each time a new Ohjah location opens, the decor inside and out are getting better. Small tatami-like room with Japanese sliding door open or close, makes each  room a very private space.  I love every Ohjah location, but this Henderson one will draw all attention since this is the newest and biggest. For the food, besides sushi and hibachi, I saw a slight changes such as small tapas that  are added to the Ohjah's originals. The warm and cozy atmosphere , fired  teppan and great service is really inviting for all ages, group and family.  Can't wait  go back again for the good food!"}
{"text":"Knowing that there is another  Ohjah  that opened in the neighborhood, we decide to check it out tonight.  We  tried out an eel-unagi don  first,  and I realized right away that Ohja's unagi donburi has a few more slices of unagi  and thicker, tastier sauce than any other Japanese  restaurant. Donburi is a typical Japanese restaurant menu item. Ohja's unagi don is not only     delicious, but the presentation  and  even the box is  exactly like what we had in Japan.  Since there is a live tank in this Ohjah location too, we tried live abalone and sweet shrimp sashimi.  Surprisingly, I found out the real  minced wasabi on the sashimi plate.   I can smell the freshness of the wasabi and when I chewed it, I got the spicy kick in my nose right way.  Special roll plate is a choice of my own, and three rolls were beautifully presented on the plate.  It looks appealing and taste  good too.  As always , we were verey much enjoyed Ohjah's night , and probably will come back for another dinner very soon!!"}
{"text":"Went with 6 people to celebrate wife's birthday.  We did the grill experience. All the food was fresh and delicious. Staff was great. Good value for the overall experience. We will be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meal with top notch service!!! We were beyond impressed. A must visit restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Have been to quite a few hibachi style restaurants, the food was good. Jason was very entertaining. I have to say the best onion volcano I've seen. It's great for kids they love the fire and show. It was 5 on a Wednesday and it was moderately busy. My sister has decided to take her Girl scout troop for a outing!"}
{"text":"I mean you've seen one habachi cook,  you've seen'm all. Good food, alright atmosphere  , Lots to offer ..full menu , sushi , habachi,  Thai, and Chinese! Not bad prices Full bar! I'm not overjoyed about this place but I'll def go back.  can't complain about the service."}
{"text":"Came here not sure what we were getting....we went to Musashi's and was not impressed but this hole in the wall was Awesome!!! Great service! The chef was hilarious. Bring your friends and family, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recommend for lunch crowd,  great service, decent food, good sake, ok price."}
{"text":"Really yummy sushi. We've been twice now and only orders off the regular menu.  The sushi is really good and their special roll deal makes it super reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxing and overall enjoyable.  We have liked everything we've ordered and this will probably be our sushi spot from now on."}
{"text":"Very happy with our meal.   I don't like mayonnaise salad dressings so the creamy ginger dressing was my only disappointment.  Good service and fun teppanyaki experience close to home. Our two little boys loved the entertainment!"}
{"text":"Went in last Friday night.  Didn't want tableside cooking but to order off the menu.  It was so busy, I figured I would  wait, it had to be good if it were that busy!   Gosh after waiting more then a hour I can say I'd never be back.  The  food was tasteless and basically each entree tasted the same!  Just with a different garnish?  I was very confused!  The hostess was a hot mess!  He kept running around and going nowhere!  The server said that they had a chef call in sick!  I guess he has the recipe book.   HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"this place is bombbbbbb.commmm the sushi is amazinnnn doeeee fa shooooo my g . adrienne is the best"}
{"text":"For me, hibachi grills are like the cirque du soleil of food -- you're there to be entertained. By the acrobatics of your main entrÃ©e, the chef's one-liner puns, and of course, the sudden blazes of fire erupting from the famed onion volcano.  Although they do offer sushi and many other items on the menu, my boyfriend and I decided to go forth with the hibachi grill for an early v-day dinner. He made us reservations which was very convenient on a Saturday night. We were seated right away despite the small crowd in the waiting area. To start, we both got the HIBACHI BASIC ENTREE ($8.95) which consists of their house salad, onion soup, vegetables, and choice of rice/noodles. From there, you select your choice of your meat/seafood which range from $6.95 (chicken) to kobe beef ($48.95).  He got the chicken which the chef sliced up nicely into bite-sized pieces, and I got the shrimp which came to about seven pieces. Both were seasoned with lemon, garlic, and butter -- yum. The fried rice was good, too. However, the mixed veggies are not. That's probably why they give you ginger sauce for them to offset the blandness. Mine came with a lot of onions, and really, I think they're just there for decoration. The people next to us didn't really eat theirs either. To drink, I had a taro boba smoothie ($4.75). The boba balls were kind of hard, but the smoothie itself was the right amount of sweet.  Overall, great interactive experience and good place to take guests. Funny to watch people's reactions, especially the little ones. Warning: Don't be surprised if the chef attempts to throw food into your mouth not unlike a sea world trainer to a hungry seal."}
{"text":"Favorite hibachi in Vegas! We always bring family and friends here and consistently have great service, food and drinks! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was a great dinner at the hibachi grill with the chef being very entertaining with a fire show and juggling. There was five adults and a baby. The Thai tea was delicious and so was the food one orders a soup, salad, noodles or rice and vegetables for $8.95 and than order beef, chicken or fish for an additional charge. Our reservations were for 8:30 pm Saturday and it wasn't crowded. We are regulars at Ohjah. The chefs at the hibachi grill are pros and put on quite a show. Such a friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Habachi Grill is my favorite thing to do. I Love some show and good food. Noodles, veggies and meat are incredible. Just brought my niece there that was in town visiting from Germany and she enjoyed the show. I tell everyone how awesome this place is. You want habachi, you'll have to go to Ohjah on Pecos!"}
{"text":"I love it ! Food is always so tasty and there prices are so good compared to other hibachi places , thank you for the good customer service!"}
{"text":"With everything that people have wrote about this place, I had high expections.  What was good about this place? Probably the ice tea and the crab rangoons that were complimentary because we had to wait an hour for our reservation that we made 3 days ago.  First off, we were in a very large party that took up two of the hibachi grills. The waitress was already pissed because half of use didn't want hibachi, which isn't our fault because the birthday girl wanted hibachi style.   This review is basically based off of service and a la carte. I ordered the spicy seafood+ a salmon roll and my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken. Before I even get to how the food tasted, I need to add that I asked one of the managers?? In a blue button up for a spoon, just because, well, I wanted a spoon to get the sauce/soup of my spicy seafood. The guy looked at me, then looked at my food and gave me a disgusted look and asked why. He had the nerve to say, \"I was wondering why you needed a spoon.\" I did not know I needed to explain myself as in why I needed a spoon in a first place??????? ANYWAYS, The spicy seafood was basically fake spicy mushroom 1/4 seafood. It literally tasted like just soy sauce/oyster sauce with sugar. It tasted better eating it with sriracha sauce. My boyfriends chicken teriyaki tasted so rubbery and the sauce tasted like the smell of cleaning chemicals for the bathroom. I don't know if it's because I'm Asian and like a lot of flavor or what it is because even my cousins Kalbi short ribs were lifeless and rubbery. My salmon roll was no big deal, the simplest dish... But.... The salmon just seemed warm and not fresh at all.    I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. The service was terrible. I don't know how many times we had to ask for drink refills. I guess for experience, you should try hibachi, but there are other places that would far more be worth it than this place. If it wasn't for the automatic gratuity, I don't even know how much I would even want to tip. After the first 5 minutes of sitting in the restaurant I was pissed. The only thing that saved this place from getting no stars, and the fact that you can't give 0 stars if you want to give a review, was the waitress named Ren. She was very nice."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the first time. It was my Wife's birthday and my kids recommended Ohjah. We had a great experience. Everything was excellent from the service to the food. Highly recommend. We will definitely be back very soon. Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been to many 5 star restaurants and I often go to fogo de chao. But for some reason, when I got their steak teriyaki, I FROZE UP! Literally it could closely top the places I go to! Such AMAZING quality!!! Cooked PERFECTLY however you want!!! Please please try their beef teriyaki here because it is really phenomenal! Their Thai tea is also really good. Their edamame is amazing and their sushis are phenomenal. The place overall looks so nice!!! This location specifically definitely tops the other ohjah locations. The staff were all extremely nice and checked up on us SOOO much before we even needed anything! Great food and great service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dining experience here tonight. I've been to a number of hibachi steak houses both name brand and one offs. The food was first rate. Our hibachi chef Jason, from my old stomping grounds of Rochester NY, was terrific...entertaining but not goofy. Support staff was warn and welcoming. The bill was half of what I would have had to pay on The Strip. Great place!"}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall fool you. This is a great restaurant. Better than the 3 other Hibachi restaurants I've been too. Friendly staff, good sake, excellent cuts of meat, and entertaining chefs. And they put up with our bachelor-party hijinks with a good attitude."}
{"text":"First time there started off with 3 rolls very good. Moved to the grill portion enjoying the friendly people around the table. Then the disappointment of finding hair in my main course. They handled the situation accordingly but will not go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on my bday...food was good, service was average...didn't like the wait time for hibachi chef to get going...just an average experience"}
{"text":"We love going here at least once a week.  Sushi chief Johnny is amazing.  The manager and staff treat us like old friends.  The sushi is so fresh.  Love the sexy geisha roll, French Kiss, Cowboy, blue diamond..oh I cant decide which is best!"}
{"text":"This is our first time at this location. I have gone to the Flamingo location numerous times to entertain out of town guests, Mother's Day, birthdays, anniversary and for no reason at all dinners. I was awfully disappointed tonight at this location."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the customer service; I should say lack there of was HORRIBLE! I had my family in town for my bday and wanted to have a nice birthday dinner. We read about the hibachi and family style menu and wanted to do family style since there were 7 of us (all adults). We were greeted very quickly, we opted for a table since they didn't have any hibachi open at the time for 7 people, it wasn't too crowded but there were a few people. We were seated in the sitting area and our waitress AUDREY came to get drink orders. Tried to sneak in a question but ignored me and left. Came back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order, when I said I had a question about family style since that is what we were interested in, she didn't even let me finish as she rudely spoke over me and said we don't do that, then I showed her on the menu where is said family style online and she said that they didn't do that we all had to order indivisdually and then share (that's completely fine portions are huge, I just wished she would have explained it or atleast let us ask questions without being bothered). She then brought out the soups, rather than giving each person one she just told the person at the end. \"Pass them down\" again with a huge attitude. Same thing with the salad. After she started bringing out the entreees we saw it was a lot and wanted to cancel one of the sides (vegetable fried rice) she said we couldn't do that since the order was already placed again with the attitude. We ate and tried to make the most of our time after all my family came in from California and Arizona for my bday and we were less than thrilled with our service. Like I said the food was phonomenal but AUDREY's service was horrific! Really going to debate on ever returning, especially to this location."}
{"text":"First time customer! Everything was awesome!   Greeted by a friendly hostess the second I walked in, everyone there just makes me feel so welcoming. They have a full bar with a wonderful bartender and the chef who made my hibachi was so entertaining, I enjoyed the whole performance and of course the food was very delicious!   Overall, I enjoyed so much of my evening experience at ohjah on pecos, they deserve to have the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"First time I laid eyes upon this steakhouse, I saw a man being taken out of the establishment via a stretcher into an ambulance. So from then on I knew their food meant some serious business. I dared myself then to have some of their cuisine and it turns out that I loved it! I especially enjoy their sushi bar. They not only had sushi but everything else on the menu available to me while at the sushi bar as well. I definitely enjoyed the variety of sushi that they could make. I tried many flavors and have my palate expanded 3 sizes that day. I definitely recommend to anyone nearby to come and try!"}
{"text":"You get the best of both worlds at Ohjah's: great, fresh fish AND unbeatable prices. They have a special where you can order three specialty rolls (with raw fish, avocados, sauces, all the good stuff) for $25!! PS: Each individual roll on the special rolls is around $12-$15 so it's a steal to order 3 for $25. I've been here three times now and with different people and they are always so grateful I showed them this place. Only thing that sucks is the location because it doesn't get very good exposure, but they are still steady during the weekdays so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"With Mother's Day around the corner I decided to try this place out before I took my mother here. Thank God I did !!! Otherwise she would have disowned me! The restaurant was  nice and looked well organized . I sat at the teppanyaki table and placed my order with the friendly waitress. I ordered the NY steak which came with soup, salad , vegetables and fried rice. I waited patiently for the grill to warm up so that the chef could start cooking, I didn't really need the frills and thrills of the teppanyaki show ( which was great btw) I just wanted to taste the food. Now , I'm not sure if it was because I was the only one at the table and the chefs are used to making larger portions of the fried rice, but my rice was super salty. Moving on to the meat which I ordered medium well and ended up being medium and was tasteless , I tried dipping it in the sauce the chef gave me but those didn't taste so good. Now to my beloved vegetables, they were bitter as if the garlic had been burnt . So basically I paid $20 for a cup of onion soup which was the best thing I ate while I dined here. 2 stars for service added an extra star for soup. Not sure if I would return again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for two years with my wife on date nights. I've been to most places in town, and this one is exceptional."}
{"text":"The Chad Man is the Pele of hibachi. He is the Gretzky of the grill. He is the Jordan of the fried rice. He is the Tom Brady of the spatula. Dude will wow you, take your breathe away, and shoot you in the face with sake.... He's the shit, if you get someone else, change tables!"}
{"text":"Big fan of hibachi eats and was not disappointed. This restaurant is clean, esthetically appealing, we loving staff and ambiance. The food was just as amazing. From the salmon nigiri to my now favoriting the \"Blue Diamond Roll\" was fresh and flavorful. The sushi and rolls not only looked delicious when served but we're a mouthful of flavor and freshness.   Our chef was entertaining and accommodating to our requests. I asked if he could make a little bit of garlic butter and sesame seed dressing and just when I had forgotten my own request he served me my little side of sauce and that turned this review from a good review to a FABULOUS review.   Everything ordered was cooked to perfection. Will most definitely add this spot to my top 5 in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly service!! Can't wait to try the hibachi at some point. The sushi rolls are amazing and the fried rice dinner is the best!! Great to bring home as well!"}
{"text":"Came for my daughter's 8th birthday and loved it. She was just at Nobu the day prior and she said this is one of her favorite. So we're going back soon for sure"}
{"text":"The price is good but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend bringing children at the habachi grill area as the chef was very inappropriate with his jokes no one was laughing because they were out of line. The food was ok."}
{"text":"Such a great environment, very fresh and good food and at around $20 a person. I'll be back again! Also great for kids."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun and my sushi was fresh and delicious! Thank you so much to Cody and Jason and for making this such a fun experience and thank you to Adolfo for keeping our table clean, and for helping us celebrate my friends birthday!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin! I was in NLV for work. I've never been to this end of town because typically it's all about the strip. My first night here we checked Yelp for a good sushi recommendation and decided on this place. Crowd-wise it wasn't what I was used to. A little rough around the edges, but we went with it. I'm so glad we did! We ate here THREE nights in a row, and it got better with each night. Our first night we decided to do the usual picks off the menu. We had 5 rolls, along with cold saki and Saporo. All of the rolls were outstanding! Our waitress (Yanny) was on point and brought us different samples of saki she thought we might like. They were all delicious! She was attentive and always made sure our drinks were full and the sushi was to our liking. I could not have asked for a better server. After we finished, the chef (Johnny) had a couple little dishes sent to our table. I was in shock! The flavor exploded in my mouth! I was literally in disbelief! My buddy, Josh, and I decided we had to return the next night. When we walked in, were instantly greeted by name by the manager, Joe. They sat us at the same table and the service got even better! We decided to go with a couple of our favorites from the previous night, and let Yanny and Johnny pick the rest. I was even more floored with what they brought us than what we had ordered. We left again saying we had to return for a third night. I didn't think our experience could get any better. I was wrong! We showed up tonight and they had a little folded paper on the table that said 'Reserved for Ken and Josh'! I was in disbelief! We decided to go with one of our choices, and let Chef Johnny choose the rest. I have been to sushi restaurants in many states, and this was BY FAR my best experience. Ever. Chef Johnny presented us with choices I would have never made on my own. The presentation and flavors were out of this world! No need for soy sauce and wasabi for these dishes! All I can say is go there and say \"Ken and Josh said this place is awesome and said that you will give us an awesome experience.\" You will NOT be disappointed! Wow! I will come here every time I'm in Vegas, even if it's a drive from the strip."}
{"text":"We come here regularly for the teppanyaki grill and the food and service is always great! We are greeted warmly once we walk through the door. The servers are very prompt in getting us seated and providing us with our drinks. The chefs are always top notch and professional in thier performance, especially at keeping my daughter entertained during the meal, she likes all the cooking tricks they do on the grill. They even cut the shrimp into little pieces so she can try to catch them. We always have a good time and the food is delicious! The prices are reasonable and the ambiance is great. The staff are all even there at the end to say goodbye. Wonderful place to have dinner and right next to the movie theatre!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! My father in law is a big fan of hibachi style restaurants so we thought we'd give this a shot instead of Benihana.  First off, the prices are reasonable and the way that the menu is set up allows everyone, regardless of your budget, the opportunity to partake in Hibachi. We each ordered the typical hibachi (soup, salad, vegetables, rice) with 2 meats for about $25. It is plenty of food too.  The food was delicious! I ordered the salmon and shrimp and could not have been happier. Dad ordered the chicken and steak and he was pleased too. We also got an order of the dragon roll and the volcano roll. I HIGHLY recommend the dragon roll. But both were fantastic.  For those that love hibachi, the show can sometimes get boring. It's the same onion volcano and egg roll every time. But not here. Our chef was HILARIOUS and tried out a lot of new stuff that kept us on our toes. We did sake shots as a table and it was a good time. Seriously, the best chef I've seen.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The filet mignon teriyaki & rice plate was really good! Same for the shrimp tempura appetizer.. The broccoli was yummy wish I could've gotten more lol.  You could definitely tell everything was fresh! I say at a regular table not hibachi.   Only dislikes were they didn't have any shrimp tempura rolls.. They have some but no classic ones for those of us that don't like raw Fish .. Oh & the smell when we walked in wasn't to pleasing but the food definitely made me forget about it :) I'd also like to see them have the option of getting fried rice with the dinner plates like they have for the hibachi plates .  * we also got a 10$ gift card for next time :) can't wait to go back & use it!!"}
{"text":"SASHIMI ALL THE WAY!!!!  More like 10 stars! Best sashimi  my husband and I have EVER had! So good we couldn't even bring ourselves to order a roll. Order the \"new modern style\" sashimi platter and let the sushi chefs blow your mind. The first two plates they selected for us and they did not disappoint. Each fish has their own garnish, their own sauce....absolutely stunning to the eye. l can't pick a favorite, everything we had was our favorite. Gotta try the salmon sashimi with truffle vinaigrette!!!!!! OMG! The couple next to us had the abalone prepared two ways and it was absolutely stunning. all of their plates have such great beauty and attention to detail. Next time i want to get the live lobster, it comes with raw lobster tail sashimi in shell and also lobster nigiri with warm miso butter, mmmmmmmm....We will absolutely be back and sing high praises to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"Hubby and i went here on a whim for date night, and we're very impressed! It wasn't busy as I thought it would be, which made me skeptical, but OH MY GOODNESS! It was delicious!   They don't have AYCE sushi, but that's okay with me. We each got a 3-roll plate ($24 per person) which was more than enough. Tried a few different rolls including the Volcano (ooey gooey and packed with scallops... mmmm) and The Black Widow ( eel, soft shell crab etc) which was amazing and by far our favorite!  All the rolls were very diverse and each had their own  unique flavor, and weren't drowning in the same sauce... which gets boring and repetitive.   I also must mention the green tea... they bring you a cast iron teapot with loose leaf Genmaicha (green tea with the toasted rice). Love love love.    We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how the rating of this restaurant is so high.  I did not eat from the hibachi menu, so maybe that makes a difference.  I ordered the sizzling steak, which is basically described on the menu as steak and onions.  More than half the plate was covered in other grilled vegetables, and very little of it was actually steak and onions.  The taste was ok, nothing that would make me want to go there again.  It was mediocre at best.  The yakisoba tasted like it was drenched in butter.  Every dish was just ok, good enough that you don't have complaints, but not good enough that I would recommend going!  Save your money."}
{"text":"Thank you chef and Henry and Cody for serving me the other night. I came in by myself around 8:30pm and it was a slow night. Good quality service and knowledgeable staff. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for off the strip Teppanyaki!"}
{"text":"Overall Oh Jah is a subpar suburbia establishment located where the old Pumi's used to be. The decor retains the same kitschy Americanized view of Asia. The food here is pretty bad through the service is fine. The sushi and Chinese dishes are bad enough that no one in my dining group bothered to eat more than two bites or bring any \"leftovers\" home. If the menu was completely revamped and the food made better than perhaps this place can avoid the same fate as Pumi's. Otherwise, I would avoid this pricey tasteless restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"Didn't realize I didn't review this place have been going here for a few years the hibachi is really good as is the sushi. Nice and clean. Every time I go it's pretty busy so I know the food is fresh. You're guaranteed to have a pretty damn good meal here."}
{"text":"So the reviews definitely drew us here. We were looking for a place for a large group and hibachi sounded fun. They were able to seat six right away on a Saturday night. The service was very friendly, everything was clean and the decor was lovely.  Our waitress was attentive, the chef was funny. Of course he has a script that he uses but there were several instances where he has quick comebacks and we had a bunch of good laughs. The food was delicious - I got tofu. Everyone else got scallops, salmon, steak, shrimp, lobster and all loved their food.   A typical hibachi experience, if you've been to a restaurant like this before, so you'll get a solid, fun and delicious experience here."}
{"text":"Great as usual. Be sure to get their salad dressing as a dipping sauce for the meats. Other hibachi places call it their 'yumyum' sauce. It's great on everything, except salads."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and Hibachi cook. The food was delicious!! The service was slow to start, but once they got started it flowed nicely. My 8 year old loved catching shrimp tossed to her!"}
{"text":"Beautiful very clean Restaurant all around .Sushi was fresh and delicious. The Sushi Chef was awesome ! Very talented and great to talk to .Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place! Did Teppan-Yaki and we loved it! Great food and even better service. Ask for Johnny at the sushi bar. He's funny and he'll make awesome creative rolls for you that aren't on the menu."}
{"text":"It's our first time to try this place. They have teppanyaki and regular dining. We decided to sat in the dining area. The place is very clean. The host is very friendly, and also the servers. The food was great. The sushi is so fresh. The price is reasonable. We will be back again."}
{"text":"The chef at my table was absolutely hilarious. My steak was cooked perfectly. I would recommend this place to anyone it's highly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent hibachi and Japanese restaurant. They have a hibachi-side and a non-hibachi side. The menu is amazing on both sides--you can get your normal hibachi items, sushi, and an excellent array of Japanese cuisine.   We chose the hibachi side, and it was excellent. The chef was awesome, humorous, and took great care of us. Our waitress was great as well, especially having two small kids with us. It was very enjoyable, and I would totally recommend this place. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off, the food was incredible, exhibition cooking was fun! Would give that 5 stars easily. But our first impression was awful and we almost left. Got there on time for our reservation. Told they are busy. Made two older sons to go back to waiting area at door to wait while we came in. ? Sat at bar to wait and the young lady bartender I am giving 0 stars. Didn't acknowledge us. Mind you, maybe 8 stool bar. Finally get her attention (she was right in front of us). Beer ordered and that was an ordeal, another asked for plum wine. OUT OF IT! Said they have been busy. ? I see customer with margarita, ask for that (was peach) and told they only make those as custom requests. ? So no margarita. Settled on a rum drink. Tasted like water, she tossed in a .. lemon ..? Tried to order another beer ( was way past reservation time) and she continued to ignore is. Squatted down below bar on her phone. Telephone ringing right beside her and she did not answer. Then she wandered away .. kept showing her empty glass to get another beer and she fills another, loudly puts it in counter and leaves. For the prices of everything, we will definitely go elsewhere for the customer service we expect for a nice evening."}
{"text":"Super amazing fun place to dine.  Asked my sister to come and test this place out with me.  I was searching on Yelp to find a Benihana type place that is more conveniently located for us Henderson folks.  I am excited to return with my Girl Scout tour in the 1.5 weeks!  I had to sit at the hibachi table.  Amazing food and show for great price.  Our Chef Jason kept us laughing.  He is quite the showman.  Best onion volcano!  He was engaging and required crowd participation.  Fried rice was yummy.  Steak cooked well.  Sister's calamari was so tender.    Hope we get Jason for our chef when I come back with my girls!"}
{"text":"ok so while visiting las vegas, my husband found this place trying to eat something good and different. well, to our surprise this place is great !! the food, customer service, imagine, they even have a certain place inside for your family to eat in like a room? private little rooms with door yeah, I know kind of weird but true... I will definitely go again. the food is delicious, tried the baby ribs mm yummy ...easy to find"}
{"text":"I won't lie, I am livid as I'm writing this review. We've been to this Ohjah multiple times and usually it's pretty good. Tonight we went and every single part of my hibachi dinner was horrific.   The chef comes to the table, and he verified each persons order and asked how everyone would like their meat cooked. I ordered my steak rare. He starts making the fried rice first, and once it's done he's somehow confused about who ordered which sides. Everyone at the table ordered fried rice except one person who wanted noodles and one person who wanted fried rice without egg. So he separates the fried rice without egg first and gives it to the person. Then put egg in the rest of it. He's somehow confused about who has fried rice once it's done cooking. He starts passing it out starting with the two people on my right, then somehow skips me and serves my husband and the entire rest of the table. Then he's STILL confused about who had fried rice. Well now that I'm the last person and he's been confused the entire time I get maybe 1/2 a bowl of rice while everyone got a full helping and since he waited so long and tried to make the bowl fuller by scraping all the burnt bits off the grill, mine is entirely burnt and crunchy and pretty much inedible.  Next came the vegetables. Thinking he'd feel bad for messing up the rice I thought I'd maybe get adequate vegetables but I was wrong. He went around starting on the other side so I was one of the last people and my portion was 75% onions and I got very little of a portion anyway, while he then passed around extras to others.   He then started the meat. He's cooking all of it and AGAIN comes back to me to ask the temperature of cook I'd like, I again say rare and he responds with \"medium rare?\", I say \"no, rare\" and he says \"medium rare?\" I say again \"no rare\" and he says \"oh, okay, rare!\" So I have he audacity to think that this is the one part of my meal he'd get right. NOPE! There's shrimp, lobster, chicken, and two types of steak on the grill. Somehow, my steak is the LAST thing to come off the grill and it's WELL DONE, like dry nasty well done. I'm fuming at this point and $70 later I didn't get to enjoy any of the hibachi dinner and left hungry. I hate being the person who sends food back or asks for the manager and with how irritated I was I just wanted to go home. I would never want to have that chef again and I probably won't be back as I've never had bad hibachi until tonight."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm japanese so I may be biased, but only because I know what its supposed to taste like. Second, whenever the menu is multicultural, you know its bad. There is a thai food menu when the restaurant is \"japanese\". Its like having french food at a british pub. Totally different language, culture, and of course food. Third, we ordered yakisoba and got chow mein. It didnt taste anything like yakisoba. Wrong type of noodles and sauce. Lastly, the miso soup tastes a day old. My grandma would weep if she drank it cause its so wrong. As I see it, its panda express food jacked up in price just because they serve sushi and hibachi. Stay away from their hot food menu.  I will admit that the quality of rice was good and the salad dressing was delicious. The rolls were decent, nothing special."}
{"text":"The Alaska King Crab roll is a must-have!  Unfortunately, the tiger roll was a little disappointing. Service was ok.  Our server was nice but I'm a firm believer that servers have to be very outgoing and I feel like they need to work on that."}
{"text":"This place has some of the rudest people I have ever met except the bartender. We were told not to sit in the seat the host seated us in by the Chinese drink lady!!! So we went to the bar and waited for another table to open, nice bartender. Same man seated us at new table, when I look over two people had been seated in our old seats. I told this man that I was leaving directly. This place has kitchen nightmares written all over it. WORST PLACE EVER. BULLS$$$$ people. That Chinese lady is so rude. BTW my girlfriend is Chinese. Go somewhere else. Everyone have a great day."}
{"text":"Finally! I've been waiting for (literally) years for a new place to open up in the old Pumi spot! First of all, 5 stars for location. Love having a cool place in walking distance. Second, I really like what they've done with the dÃ©cor - it's definitely upgraded from the old Pumi days, with a smaller sushi bar in back, and a larger \"bar\" bar in front. Third, the food. There are the Sohos and the Yonakas and the Yojies of the Southwestern Vegas world, but we didn't really have any inventive Japanese places in the Southeast...until now! We had tuna carpaccio (yum), suzukiana (or something - halibut....super yum), Bluefin tuna (awesome), a raw beef dish (medium good...but at least it was really huge), and the screaming o (typically not my style, but I ordered with the sauce on the side and just dipped it and it was really good). Oh yeah and the salmon nachos (good. Served on a pringle!). Food was excellent. Prices are reasonable. For all that, plus edamame and a bottle of really good sake, it was about $120. Hibachi meals start around $18 I think. Overall, we'll definitely be back, with the kids."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing here! I brought grandma this time and she liked it! She is the real food critic lol. I had a pink lady, gentleman's club and show me the love (in that order). Service is prompt and friendly on top of the amazing food. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and environment! The live performance of the hibachi is definetly worth the trip. If you go also look at their sushi menu, some of the rolls on there are too die for!"}
{"text":"OBSESSED with Ohjah. This location is always beyond hospitable, friendly, consistent and fun! Very clean and food is ALWAYS amazing. Every server, especially the kind man who always does Sake Bombs with us, is wonderful. Best hibachi place in Henderson."}
{"text":"Just as delicious as the other location. So happy they are right around the corner from us."}
{"text":"Most teppan places are pretty much the same.   Over time, Benihana and the rest tend to seem to have mellowed and become a bit of a yawn; the same jokes, tricks, and narration no matter where you go. The food is good, and for the most part reasonable priced. What made this one incredible was our chef, \"Chad\".  Remember when you first experienced teppan and it was fresh and fun?  Yep! That's what Chad was like.  Enthusiastic, humorous, and an excellent chef.  Of all the many teppan places in Vegas, I will go out of my way to return to this specific one, just to get Chad as our chef! Well done, guys!  The fact that they don't close until 11pm was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Thank you to our teppan Chef Hou. You were awesome and completed a wonderful meal.  Entertainment,  good food, prepared very well and  lots of fun.  Thank you"}
{"text":"my favorite sushi place! me and my boyfriend are like regulars here, they offer an amazing 3 special roll combo that I get everytime along with other food. also they are open till 11 which is amazing because most resterauntS in this area close pretty early!"}
{"text":"This is a very good Japanese hibachi steakhouse! The filet was excellent. The chicken was very good. Excellent noodles.  I had an order of tamago and found it to be excellent -creamy, sweet, and tasty. Perfect size.  Our chef was just a bit lackluster in entertainment value, but he cooked up a storm.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to another location and enjoyed the food. We wanted to take friends from out of town to this restaurant location because it was the closest. We took our kids too. Our kids loved the California and Philly rolls so much that they ordered a second serving of each. Our friends enjoyed their order. No complaints. My husband got the terriyaki chicken bento box and said he has had better from the other location. I ordered the duck...   If you plan on eating with your friends and you don't want them to watch you eat while their plates are empty then don't order the $18 duck! My food came once everyone was finished eating. They also charge extra if you don't want rice and only want vegetables. They had to also fix my \"crispy\" duck which wasn't crispy.   I give 4 stars because the waiter was super friendly, attentive, great with kids. The manager was kind to follow us and make sure we were sure about adding extra gratuity on top of the added gratuity on the ticket. I appreciate that since some places don't do that."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday, not at all busy. Our first tie there to. We even made a reservation the night before just in case. Walked in and was greeted right away. They sat us along with three other people. The only thing that got me under my skin was the guy who took my drink order, literally stared me down , rushing me to make a decision on a alcohol drink. I even told him I'm not ready but he didn't get that. He wouldn't leave till I ordered, that was annoying sorry.   Anyway, the salad was OK. Wasn't that great, I probably will skip it next time. Wasn't fresh... the soup was delicious! Our cook was funny and was very cool. He cooked our food really good. I had the shrimp and New York steak, husband had the lobster, clams and steak. Lobster was very good and he said the clams were rich. I loved the veggies too. We will definitely be going back :)   **I gave them four stars for the guy who rushed me and the salad. Maybe next time it will be better experience:)"}
{"text":"We always have a good time and a good meal when we come here. The chefs always cook the food to perfection. The filet is awesome. We have about four Japanese steakhouses around us and this is our go to place. The salad dressing as a dipping sauce and over the rice is a must. We defiantly come back again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place went here for my first time today, it was great customer service, and really cool how they cook the food right there in front of you and the cook is not just sitting there quiet like some places they are nice and the tricks they do with the food are amazing I would recommend anyone to go here and eat. The price is not too expensive but is not cheap either."}
{"text":"My family LOVES habachi, so we're always looking for the best place. We used to go to Sushi-Ko which is great but most of the time it's so hard to get a table. ohjah has a lot of tables and we can always get a reservation for the day/time we want. We've never had a bad chef and the food is great!"}
{"text":"First of all, make sure if you have a reservation, go to the right location. I made a reservation for 12, then as we were getting ready to go my friend put it into GPS. It never dawned on me that he didn't know which one we were going to. We finally made it 30min late. I called as soon as we left the wrong location and they were so nice. It was no problem. Got to the restaurant and the food was amazing. Hot sake was perfect and the chef provided excellent entertainment. I love going to Hibachi's and I think this is as good as, if not better than, Benihana. Prices are very reasonable. This is a must in Vegas if you're able to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"Went here on a friday night around 8pm.. We had our own table at the hibachi side. Our food came out quickly and everything tasted great. I recommend buying the groupon: $40 worth of food for only $20"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a friend because he said they had good bobas.  We left the movies down the street and arrive about 10 mins before they were about to close.  I decided on the combination fried rice and got it to go.  It was good and I would return to this place to try their other items."}
{"text":"I love this place..love the edamame - it has a special seasoning that's to die for.. I've had several of the sushi rolls, loved them all. I've had their salmon & it was bursting with flavor.. overall it's a lot of fun for a couples date night or family get together.. service is great but can get pretty busy on weekends !"}
{"text":"I love this place , I always go too the cooking grill for dinner. Really good food and good intertainment."}
{"text":"Went to the location on West Sahara.   Very limited menu compared to the other locations. so they want  you to have the hibachi, which was tasteless.  The best part of the meal was the fried rice.   If you want variety, do not go here."}
{"text":"My family and I went to celebrate my niece and nephew's birthday. Everyone is really nice but the food is very bland. The hibachi was okay with the fried rice being the best part of the meal; probably because the chef added lots of garlic.  So the sushi...OMG the poor sushi. I don't think I've had sushi this bad before. The quality isn't good, the rice isn't prepared with vinegar or the appropriate amount of water (it had way too much water), and the sauces were so BLAH! I don't know if the usual sushi chef was on vacation or what, but I honestly do not understand why other reviews praise the sushi. I normally go to Yama or SAKANA  but I wouldn't say I'm a sushi snob. It was so sad I just don't understand. Sad face."}
{"text":"Our server was really sweet and attentive . We ordered dinner plates with chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura appetizers . We also ordered California rolls, spicy tuna rolls and tempura rolls . At the end we ordered tempura ice cream . Overall I think our meal was just ok . No bento boxes here for dinner ... maybe we should of had the hibachi ."}
{"text":"The food is priced right and very good, however, our hib. Chef wasn't that good. I do know they have others there that are very good - so hope you get a good one:)"}
{"text":"Since this FINE restaurant is only a 45 sec. Drive from the house, we have been there several times and will continue; the presentation as well as the taste of the food is Superior to any-other Hibachi House in town."}
{"text":"I was here earlier in the day, not a pleasant experience. The waitress kept rushing us, like if they were even busy. The host or manager who ever it was said oh we are quite busy but we can accommodate your party of five. On that note I was happy but soon as we walked I immediately notice only two parties, really come on people get your shit together. The food was mediocre not sure why, I used to love this place. Might be back in a year or so, however this experience left a sour taste. Note to management: don't rush your customers especially if not busy, the waitress needs to give us time to go over the menu rather than scolding us five minutes in. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"We live close by so it is our fall back restaurant when we go out. It never disappoints and always entertaining. The food is good, too. Best to make a reservation or expect to wait."}
{"text":"Been there twice now and both times the food and service were excellent! The Sushi quality is fantastic and the variety is very good. If you like wasabi ask for their fresh wasabi!"}
{"text":"My family and I went for my sisters birthday and it was awesome. Food was good, chef was fun. He made the night fun."}
{"text":"The servers are friendly and attentive and keep things moving at a comfortable pace.   The chefs are wonderful...you can tell at some points the trickery gets mundane..but all in all I will definitely return and bring friends   Try the spider roll"}
{"text":"This spot really exceeded my expectations. I've been hearing how good the location on Blue Diamond is from co-workers so I was excited to see that this location opened up closer to home for me. Added bonus, they mail me coupons since I live in the area.   I ate here on a weeknight and the restaurant still had a nice crowd. We did make a reservation to be safe and were seated immediately. There was another party at our table, but the hostess spaced us out so that we weren't on top of each other which was nice. Dinner started leisurely with time to choose drinks and a sushi starter. Our waitress was attentive with help from other staff as well.   Before the chef arrived for dinner and a show we were served salad and an onion soup. I really liked the soup and I loved the cold ginger dressing on the salad. Once the chef (and the show) arrives the fried rice (or noodles) comes up followed by veggies and then the protein of your choice. I loved all of my food and found it to be even better than I expected. The portions were definitely not lacking either. The pricing was much less than I expected for Hibachi as well.  This is a nice spot for good food with friends or family. I'd definitely recommend coming in here in a group."}
{"text":"Very clean. Great sushi. Good service. I went on Mother's Day and they gave me a ten dollar gift card for my next visit it was pretty awesome. Crunch roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday there. My kids and I truly enjoyed the experience!! Place is new and clean. Service is friendly and attentive. Everyone happy and smiling. They never kept us waiting long. Hibachi chef was friendly and very interactive with all his guests. Food was delicious and fresh. We each tried a different item on the menu. Steak, shrimp, chicken, lobster. It was all amazing. So much food for such an incredible price!! And at the end they surprised me with singing and a mango cheesecake with a birthday candle! What a wonderful experience indeed! We will definitely be back with our family and friends."}
{"text":"Before moving to Vegas I used to frequent a different Japanese restaurant but this one is quite a nice replacement! Our hibachi chef was so entertaining and made our date night dining experience so fun! Everything was cooked perfectly. I especially loved our japanese lasagna rolls! I could definitely be a regular here!   The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is bc they don't serve shrimp sauce regularly."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on two occasions, but unfortunately were disappointed both times.  First time we ate sushi, and while the pricing was very reasonable, the quality of the fish was only average.  The second time we ate at the hibachi grill. Our chef was good but not exceptional in his 'act' while preparing our food.  You could hardly hear his comments as he performed.  More importantly, the hibachi food was uninspired.  The Gyoza were under-cooked. The fried rice was basically rice with egg and a little scallion and lots of minced garlic.  The vegetables were properly cooked but bland, with the primary taste being the onions.  The NY steak was properly cooked, but a mix of chewy and parts that were tender.  The scallops were large, for the most part properly cooked (except for one under-cooked) . Again, the pricing was extremely reasonable, but food not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The staff are always amazing and the food is great! I grew up in Japan and can say first hand that the sushi is fresh. My only request is that they would offer a combo meal that included authentic rolls and sushi."}
{"text":"Ok....my husband and I gave up on sushi places in Las Vegas over 6 months ago since we always left disappointed ( go figure...a San Diego and Hawaii Native, we're bound to be critical). I know it's a desert but c'mon, you can still get fresh stuff daily. ANYWAY... This place is absolutely amazing! Found it through a groupon!  My husband got the Kamikaze Roll and Crunchy Roll and thought they were excellent!!!!  I got their \"modern style\" sashimi (tuna with garlic chips, yellowtail with micro fries, salmon with truffle oil, Ono wrapped crab, albacore Cajun with wakame, and surf and turf steak and crab). The yellowtail, Ono, and tuna my favorites!!!! The salmon being the least favorite.  Also had soft shell crab, very good as well!  We even got a gift card for next time when leaving! Wow!  Conclusion - excellent service, food, and environment!!!!! Even though we live on the east side, we're going back! A must go!"}
{"text":"I first tried this restaurant in blue diamond and I loved it, I was in the area and noticed you had another location and I decided to give it a try. Just as good!!! Will always keep in mind this location as well."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing teppanyaki/hibachi experience, look no further!! I came here last week with my boyfriend and two best friends to celebrate my birthday. We came in a little late for a Tuesday night (10:15 and they close at 11). But you would have never guessed. We were treated like ROYALTY! The chef was so incredible and very entertaining. And the food? The BEST!! I ordered the filet mignon, and I have never had a steak melt like butter in my mouth! The shrimp, noodles, and fried rice were also incredible. They ended the night playing \"happy birthday\" on the restaurants sound system (I'm assuming because we were the only people in the restaurant) while singing and presenting me with a delicious green tea cake and candle!! Such an amazing evening. Thank you for making my birthday so memorable!"}
{"text":"I really love teppanyaki and have been to several places here in the Vegas area. That being said i feel that i may be a bit picky seeing as i have found my favorites. Ojhah is a pretty average plave the food is ok nothing special and the chef we got did a fairly basic show nothing to write on here about honestly just wasnt a vwey special evening in all fairness. We prefer Geisha house and samurai steakhouse for the nights out looking for teppanyaki. If you want a great show i would suggest going elsewhere but the food is okay and if it is close to you go ahead and give them a shot. I would rather go to the places i have found so i won't be returning though i do wish this establishment the best I'm just not a huge fan."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were average as well as the sashimi. Restaurant was cute and the waitress and manager were very attentive and friendly. Smelt eggs didn't taste well and informed the manager who had no problem returning it and taking it off our bill. We tried the red and white sake sangria that tasted good but not sure it's worth what they charge. We got a $10 gift card so may return to just use that. If they worked on the taste I think this place would see more customers."}
{"text":"I grew up in Japan and whenever I eat Japanese food, such as yakisoba, I look for that familiar taste. The yakisoba was NOT authentic. It tasted like butter and soy sauce. I've had way better yakisoba and Japanese food at other places in town. The atmosphere and the hibachi grill is fun, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Having a late craving for fried rice, we had to hit this place up and because of its proximity. From there, the appetite grew!  For starters, a well fried and not too oily gyoza with a tasty ponzu sauce, a sushi and salmon sashimi, and beef sukiyaki, a clear noodle soup with a sweet sukiyaki base.   I hadn't ever tried beef sukiyaki before, and it surprisingly delicious, although I'm not always into sweet main dishes. The raw egg served on top of the cast iron piping hot soup was like the cherry on top of a sundae. It's something I love, and breaking the egg was like food porn. At that point, I could certainly say, \"Oh yeah!\" to Ohjah!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for my daughter's birthday.  The food was outstanding at the hibachi.  We all had two meats with our standard required meal.  A bottle of wine and a few beers later, the bill was only 140 for 4 people.   Keep in mind that this is not a gourmet restaurant, food was great and there was plenty of it.   We are going back for the next birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is great! Great sushi rolls. Excellent service. We sat at the hibachi grill for my brother birthday. Excellent food and great atmosphere. Everything we tried was yummy. Great experience and will be happy to take more out of town visitors! (Also very clean)"}
{"text":"Wonderful first experience for hibachi in Vegas. It was very clean and the food was delicious. The service  was excellent.  They were fast and friendly from the moment we walked in the door. We were seated right away and our drink order was taken immediately. Not bad for a Saturday date night!  We will definitely be back!  Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"What can i say i'm a sucker for hibachi, I had the opportunity to try several hibachi restaurants around town and this one is a pretty good one. When you walk in you do not have to wait very long. The service is great, the entertainment is awesome and the prices are even better! For less than 20 bucks you can get soup, salad, vegetables, rice and your main entree (just chicken for only $15!). I would recommend the filet mignon and maybe the scallops. This is probably one of the only places where you can have the option to pick fried noodles or fried rice."}
{"text":"first of all it is a lot bigger inside than it looks outside. nice decor and atmosphere. the wait staff arealways willing to accommodate your needs. The sushi chefs are very entertaining and knowlegable. They have a huge hibachi room with plenty of seating and short wait times. Ren was our server last night. She was amazing! We will back and request her...  Now for pricing, they have average prices on rolls etc... but then they hsve specials and a \"boat\" of sushi,nigiri etc.. that is one hell of a deal!  I highly recommend trying it and ask for Ren( I probably spelled it wrong)!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of hibachi, but this place was pretty dope. Definitely likely it better than our Manhattan annoying chain restaurant. Although you probably wont catch me back, I got nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Best habachi deal in Vegas. All sides for $8 And steak salmon $8-10. Chicken only $6. Yum"}
{"text":"Dropped by to try the Tepanyaki. The food was good, although its not quite Beni Hana. The chef was great. Entertaining, fun to watch, completely engaged with the people at the table!   Regarding the food. I had the Filet. It was cooked perfect. t just lacked flavor. Even with the sauces they provide. The sauces tasted watered down a bit. Not a lot of flavor in them.  About the service. Our waitress was just \"there\". By that I mean she never paid attention to what we wanted. I asked for water with no lemon, I got water with lemon. I asked for white rice, I got fried rice.   Not sure if I would return. Especially when Beni Hana is here!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a hibachi place in about 10 years, but I'm really looking forward to going back to this one soon.   We did the hibachi dinner (of course), although I do want to go back in the future specifically for the sushi boat as that looked awesome.   It was a really short wait from when we ordered to when the chef started cooking and the wait felt even shorter as after ordering they almost immediately brought out the salad and onion soup (yum). The entertainment factor was fun and it was interesting to actually get to watch everything get cooked.  The actual grilling takes place in 3 stages: the rice/noodles (FYI that brown rice is brought out to you by a waiter and not from the hibachi grill in front of you), vegetables, and finally meat & seafood. I like to eat my food groups mainly separately anyway so this worked out well for me as I could start on the items as they came off the grill, but if you're a big \"combined plate\" person, waiting through 3 stages for your complete plate might seem to be a little much.   I decided on the shrimp and brown rice and also got to try the sole. The shrimp came off the grill with great flavor and cooked perfectly. The sole was flakey and delicious and was a fairly large piece of fish. I am looking forward to trying the fried rice and the scallops in the future as those looked amazing coming off the grill and the scallops were huge.   One of the best things about this hibachi grill though is the pricing. I wanted to price compare so I looked at the Benihana menu on the strip (the next closest hibachi grill) and the prices there were $10-15 dollars more per plate than Ohjah. Dinner at Ohjah was a really fair price and I'm excited to bring more friends and family in the future."}
{"text":"Helpful staff and delicious food! Prices are reasonable.  The place is usually busy but never a super long wait.  They tKe reservations, been to a couple of the locations here in Vegas and they never disappoint with the different things they offer. Awesome and talented Hibachi chefs, super friendly as well"}
{"text":"I usually go to musashi but this place is around the corner from my house and I wanted to give it a try.  The prices are actually pretty good when it comes to the hibatchi grill.  The chef that we had did the usual funny routine while cooking, but really didn't seem into it as much as another chef that was cooking at the other grill. It might just be because the people we had next to us weren't very into it so maybe that's why he didn't give it more effort.  The food tasted great and I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Overall it was a great experience and I will be back for more"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try this place as nothing in that area is remotely interesting. Once inside I realized it's a hidden gem. Gorgeously decorated, incredible service and terrific food to boot! I was very pleased with the sushi and on my second try even more impressed with the Habachi room! Best fried brown rice ever! I'm bringing my family here for a gathering bevy it's the perfect place for good food and good times!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The entertainment was nice nothing over the top. You could tell that the chef was overworked from his forced happiness. Nothing really gave a wow factor but still was nice."}
{"text":"So good! Reasonably priced, chefs are funny and very experienced! Great service too! Highly recommend. I've been to this local and the one on Flamingo and Hualapai. Super fun!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! The sushi is amazing! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the yum yum sauce wasn't what I'm used to. It's kind of watery. Other than that great service great food."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for my birthday, we did the Hibachi. The food was delicious and they give you good portions of food. The employees and the cooks are very friendly and put on a great show. Definitive tried other Hibachi places in the past and this is definitely the best one so far! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place me and my chick loved it so much cheaper than Benihana with the same exact quality plus ohjah sushi is Way better"}
{"text":"Had a great time I took my grandson there for his birthday he loved it!!! Thanks for the experience 2/6/16"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner the chef was so entertaining food was delicious. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to this place for Mother's Day and it was great! our chef was really friendly and interactive, the good was great and our server was very nice! really nice atmosphere. they even have all the women 10 dollar gift cards! it was very sweet and I am definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"We love Hibatchi/Teppanyaki table side cooking, but we had a mediocre experience at one about a year ago and just hadn't gone in awhile.  While shopping, we found Ohjah near Lake Meade/95 and decided to give it a try. We've now been there three times in the last few months. Each experience was different, but they were all fun. I'd say that if you want to really have a fun/lively time, try this place and make sure engage the chefs."}
{"text":"We used to think this place was awesome. This time was a major disappointment. We are a couple with 2 smalls kids. The chef was ok in the fun department, but the food was horrible. Our kids got the chicken and it was so over cooked, neither one of our kids would even try it. My husband got the filet and asked for it to med rare, it came out well done :(. I got the scallops, they were alright but very little flavor. Our kids ask to go to \"fire\" all the time and we are sad to say we will have to find a new place to go. I am a foodie at heart and love going out for good food, but to pay over $100 for inedible food is hard to take."}
{"text":"My family brought my brother here after his graduation, we had a reservation for 8:30pm and it was awesome. We're from California, and I have to say my experience was the best, better than any Benihana I've ever visited. Dennis was hilarious, he was entertaining, funny, and witty. He tossed the shrimps in the air for all of us to catch in our mouths, made a tune tapping on the grill when he pushed the flaming volcano along, needless to say it was great. We will definitely be back and request Dennis!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fun and entertaining, the habachi master was fantastic will go back again for sure.  If you plan on going at night during the weekend and interested in sitting at the habachi table make sure you call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and a friend recommend this place. Food and atmosphere were good but what really made this experience so memorable was our cook Chad. He was HILARIOUS and just all around awesome. Would go again but only if Chad was my cook."}
{"text":"Came here with the family and we had a great time. The services was fast and the food was outstanding. We plan on returning soon and to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We love this place. We needed to find another local sushi bar where we could hang out and just enjoy ourselves. Well we have found it! We do not even have to tell them what we want to order. They just know and get it right every time. Very friendly!!! AND GREAT FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"The lady & I's first ever hibachi experience!! After reading a few reviews prior, we were hoping to get Jason as our hibachi chef and sure enough we did. He was definitely brag worthy!!  We came on a Saturday night with a 7:30 pm reservation, and waited about 10 minutes. We were seated along with another party, and Jason introduced himself while doing a few things with his knives that will definitely catch your eye and as he put it, \"wake up!!\". I'd rather much not tell about the entire experience with him because I really think it's worth seeing it for yourself! Overall he was a nice man with funny comments and definitely kept us smiling and laughing.  For the both of us, it came out to about $40 but that's also with my appetizer of teriyaki chicken on the side. We were so stuffed! We chose the hibachi teppanyaki that came with onion soup, side salad with their own style dressing, and fried rice. With $6-7 more for the protein choice, (we had chicken).  It's definitely worth checking this place out. Highly recommended, and worth every cent. Fresh, and a nice experience. Perfect for a date night too!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and great prices. We got the Blue Diamond special that includes 2 rolls, 4 sashimi and 4 nigiri for $26...if that's not a good price, I don't know what is! If you like edamame, get the garlic edamame- it does have a spicy kick to it, though.  My husband and I have been there 3 times - last time we went we had 2 beers, garlic edamame, a blue diamond special and an additional roll and the bill was less than $65...lots of food for a reasonable price (especially for quality sushi!). I encourage anyone interested to go and try this place. My only complaint is that it's a bit chilly in there so I always bring a jacket."}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience here and it was awesome. The staff was very friendly and attentive and the food was very tasteful and delicious. We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Got a hibachi table without reservations in 30 minutes while having sushi and sake. The Hibachi table was worth the wait for sure , we had an great time laughing and eating with our group as well as the others at the big table. The staff did a great job ! And the combo is the way to do for the hibachi too"}
{"text":"If you are the type that likes teppanyaki style food, you will enjoy this restaurant.   While not the most traditional and a more franchise generic type of establishment, you will find your hankering for steak, chicken, seafood and alcoholic drinks well taken care of here.   The ambiance is very nice, there is a small sushi bar and plenty of teppanyaki tables. If you are entertaining, or just gathered with friends this is a great place.   Service is very good here.   In terms of a real authentic Japanese meal, well don't choose this place for that reason. I would put this place on par with those Brazilian steakhouses in terms of a style more than an authentic experience. This is like having your meat grilled with salt pepper and soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.   GK says good for what it is."}
{"text":"Fun experience. Didn't over oil and butter the fried rice which I appreciated. Food was good. I had salmon which was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my husband's birthday and had an entire hibachi table to ourselves with Nick as our chef.  It was very good and a much better choice than Geisha house (which is where we tried to go however they had no AC).  Will definitely check it out again.  Not busy on weeknights.. kind of a bad location."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant! I would eat here daily if I could. The service, entertainment, and food are impeccable!"}
{"text":"Was pretty happy and surprised at the quality of the sushi in this strip mall sushi restaurant. The service was great and I hope they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing services and staff... Our first visit here & we will be back !"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been here a few times and we've never been disappointed to say the least.    I just remember one night we were both craving sushi and unfortunately we haven't really established a go-to place.  Yummy Sushi Grill is great, but it didn't fit to our taste buds.  I was really hesitant to try sushi again, as a couple years back I went to Sushi Ko off of Craig and Tenaya and got really sick from their quality of eel.  So we decided to try here and I seriously was not disappointed.  For me, usually with sushi places if I start to yak that means it's not good.  But that never happened here, meaning their quality is pretty good.  My favorite rolls as of right now are the Alaskan King Crab, Give Me a Break, Shogun, and Gentlemen's Club.   Of course I'm going to try more when I come back!  Their service is also exceptional, I remember my second visit the young waitress was making sure I was okay because I noticed their dinner menu had bell peppers in it as vegetables and I didn't know, which I'm allergic to.  I ordered one of them and I had to pick it all out, but I assured her that I was okay.  I would definitely recommend everyone to come here.  Of course it is a lil bit more pricey depending on how much you get, but the food and the service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent!! VERY affordable hibachi! Great selection of meats and fresh veggies. They also have a great looking sushi bar that I will be going back to try. The restaurant was very clean. All in all a great experience!! I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and entertainment.  Be ready to catch shrimp with your mouth. Staff is great. The filet is the best! This is one of my favorite restaurants. I will eat here at least once a month if not more. I forgot to mention their prices are excellent. The best for hibachi dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place!! We go here every time we visit my kid in Vegas. The food, service, and chef act ... they're all great. It's so much better than the hibachi grill we've frequented before where their cooking and service have depressingly gone down due to their famed name. I strongly recommended this place to friends and families whenever they're in the area. Haven't been disappointed at all."}
{"text":"This place was great! Its been a few years that we've been to an Ohjah restaurant so we were really excited to come eat! The cook was great and was very entertaining for the kids and the adults as well... we had a blast! The only thing that was off was the lady going around taking the orders and filling up our drinks ... I didn't catch her name but she wore glasses... she wasn't very friendly and didn't smile once... it's packed in there so I'm sure she's busy and we also had a large group that split our checks into 3 (from the beginning we let her know tho) .. anyway besides her the service was great! Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, polite staff and one of the cleanest restaurants I have ever been in. Doesn't hurt that it's so close to home as well."}
{"text":"It's been a Been weeks since..than, There is a manger named Cody who curses me for some misunderstanding communication..he is very rude...plus he has no professionalism yelling at his employees in front of the whole restaurant!!!!!! Should have take her to the side and talk to her like human. Never experienced anything like this before, this dude has no work ethic what so ever."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fun for a group of friends or just to meet new friends. The combination hibachi for $31.95 is what my husband and I both did so we could try a bunch of things. We did filet, chicken, scallop and shrimp between the two of us. Everything was good. Service was entertaining. We had a good time and will be back."}
{"text":"I must say the staff is lovely and I wanted to give 5 stars but there were a couple of issues. We had. 7:30 reservation we were seated by eight and we basically didn't eat anything until 845. They did apologize for the delay, they were busy but wouldn't you be prepared for being busy? The soup, salad, vegetables, and rice were delicious and worth 5 stars. the filet ordered med. rare was well done and ultimately tough.  I would definitely go back and give them another chance and let them know that med rare does not mean well."}
{"text":"Great place for udon soup. Always go hete for seafood udon soup, which is plenty to fill me up. Have tried appetizers on the menu, which is also good."}
{"text":"A great hibachi sushi hybrid establishment. Available seating for an authentic hibachi grill experience, traditional tables and intimate enclosed rooms for dining. I got to try items from both the sushi and hibachi portions of the menu. Excellent fried rice and grilled vegetables. The tuna tatake and wagyu beef tatake were wonderful and well presented. The Sex on the Beach roll was spicy and fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Dinner was wonderful, I had sushi my husband had Chilean sea bass.  Service was great we had a gentleman server and I mean he was very kind and gracious. Awesome place to go for a special occasion with the steak tables!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the ambiance and seating were really nice. the food was pretty good as well. There were some rolls that didn't really fit my taste, but the presentation was really, really nice. I loved the sashimi. Loved it. The Cajun tuna was really yummy!  As far as I could read on the menu, they didn't offer AYCE, which made it really expensive for me, so if I hadn't had a coupon..other than that I really liked this place, it was cozy and inviting."}
{"text":"Second time this week. Great on the hibachi side and sushi is just as good. Happy that this location is near me because there isn't too many hibachi style restaurants in the Northwest side of Vegas. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great good, big menu, lots of options for non sushi eaters like my husband. Portions were large."}
{"text":"Teppan grill was outstanding and our grill master was very entertaining! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch/early dinner with a large group and were graced with the teppan showman, Ramon! Our group definitely enjoyed the food more so because of our chef!   The food itself was good and full of flavor, and I didn't have any leftovers to take home!   I ordered the shrimp teppan bundle, which comes with soup and salad to start, grilled veggies, and my choice of fried noodles and the shrimp.   The noodles were really good and flavorful, with the shrimp tasting fresh and cooked perfectly. Ramon really entertained well and got the group incorporated with having us allllll catch food in our mouths and having fun discussions with us all getting the group engaged! Not one person was on their phones during the meal!!   Even though I normally don't go to teppan places, this was a fun location and I would come back with groups for good food and a show."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, a must try for hibachi lovers  I haven't tried the sushi here yet, but the hibachi here is amazing. The chefs are friendly and do a great performance, and communicate with customers very well. It's a blast coming here, I have more fun here then I do at some entertainment shows on the strip.  The overall design of the place is great, when you first walk in it's the normal restaurant, and a whole separate room for the hibachi. The colors are dark but not depressing, and it's an overall romantic ambiance that's perfect for evening dinners.  Pricing is a-ok here compared to other places, if not cheaper. The service is very attentive and polite.  The food is great, I usually just get extra vegetables with mine (which are cooked just right), but my friends had the salmon, beef, and scallops and claim they are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Really good I love the sushi killer bees yum The food was well prepared I also enjoy the fried rice"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner... Chef was great!  Had filet and Sole fish and would definitely come back once in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice now and had even better time the second time around. As usual, the customer service is always great. What really stood out is the level of thoughtfulness, we came in right at opening time and we had my sister and my 6 month old nephew with us. The owner and our waiter saw us lugging a car seat so they sat us in a bigger booth to give my sister more room. That really stood out for me. Our waiter(Feng/Joe) was very thoughtful as well, we never had to seek him out for a drink refill or to clear a plate and he was very careful of the baby when serving. As usual, the food was fantastic. I'm not a fan of sushi at all but my sister is and she loved the dragon roll she ordered. But there are plenty of other non-sushi entrees that can please. I had the chicken katsu this time and the beef teriyaki before. Both were delicious and the servings are so large that my sister and I were able to split it. I will definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"We went and tried out the sushi side - not the hibachi.     Compared to the other places around town, it's comparable and mediocre. They have a decent variety of rolls and a few specialty rolls. The taste is good, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.   This place is new, and I'm surprised it's not that busy. The hibachi side wasn't busy either. I heard from a neighbor that hibachi is good, but I'm not that big into it because you're paying more for the show, which is fine. I've never had amazing hibachi, but I can't rate this place based off of that. It could be the most amazing hibachi in the entire world.   The customer service is alright, especially since it was pretty slow. There were only 3 other tables being waited on. Our server was very sweet, but she kept forgetting things. We had to ask for additional waters when we asked for 1 per person, ask for our beer twice and she forgot one of our rolls. (Which we were pretty grateful for since we were so full.) We didn't complain or say anything, but the manager seemed to notice. He came by a couple of times to make sure everything was okay. He also gave us a $10 gift card for our next visit. I'm not sure if he was trying to make us feel special... or if he gave one to everyone that night.   I would like to try this place again, and maybe on the hibachi side. As for the sushi, I'm not the biggest fan."}
{"text":"Soup is very different if you have had the traditional Japanese hibachi dinners. The service is slow and waited with a reservation for 2.5 hours to eat and get out of there. Then waitress messed up bill. We paid the balance of what we owed and they still took the 30.00 from the party that already paid it.  We told the other party and the manager came and said if we made a mistake I will spank her. Very inappropriate and immature. The hibachi chef was very blah and food not bad but not like many other places where you can get. Go to geisha house if you want good hibachi and a fun time for a date or family.  My credit card also has 2 charges. So pay cash if you go"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my brother after a long day of work. Initially, we had planned to go to another sushi restaurant but read the reviews for this place.  First impression of the place was really nice. The restaurant is split into two sections: the hibachi tables and booths on the side. They also have a bar up front as well.  The menu offered a great deal of options. However if you want hibachi, you have to sit at the hibachi tables.  My brother and I ended up going with the Ohjah Boat, which includes your choice of 3 special rolls, 12 pieces of sashimi, and 10 pieces of nigiri. The sashimi and the nigiri are chef's choice. I was initially sad that I couldn't pick certain nigiri; however, the presentation and quality of the fish really pushed my rating to 5 stars. The fish pieces were fatty and well portioned when it came to the rice to fish ratio. Also the sushi rolls were great (my brother and I chose the Black Widow, Tsunami, and volcano roll). My personal favorite was the Black Widow. Besides the boat, we also got 2 orders of eel nigiri and a salmon Kama. All of which were cooked perfectly and delicious. The service was also excellent. Our server frequently checked up on us and gave us suggestions when we had difficulty choosing options.  I would definitely recommend coming to this place. It's decently priced for a place that does a la carte. Will definitely come back but to try the hibachi next time!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was great! Our teppanyaki chef was very skilled, entertaining, and funny. I ordered the new york strip and my friend got the filet mignon, both cooked to our liking. It came with a miso soup and house salad as starters. The entree included grilled veggies and your choice of fried rice or noodles. My favorite trick of the night was the flying shrimp where the chef flung a piece of shrimp into each diner's mouth.  I haven't tried their regular sushi menu but I may go to their other location that's closer to my house for that.  Overall, a very wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner after going to the movies. The place is nicely decorated and has separate areas for hibachi, bar, sushi bar and regular seating in the front. Ohjah would be great for groups as well as intimate settings. Now onto the food.  My husband and I can eat a lot of sushi and typically leave places with over $100 meal. We ordered one Ohjah boat with the Snow White roll (garlic ponzu on super white tuna), Sweet Heart roll (spicy tuna with yellow tail on top) and the Golden Gate roll (shrimp tempura). We loved the Sweet Heart and Snow White rolls the best, not that the Golden Gate was bad it just wasn't as great as the other two rolls. It was more of a meh.   The boat presentation was beautiful. We also tried the strawberry smoothie, some sake and the seaweed salad that came with the Ohjah. With the giant Ohjah Boat which also included 12 pieces of sashimi and 10 pieces of nigiri we were happily stuffed and our entire bill was $75. That is amazing considering how much sushi we can eat. Although Las Vegas is known for all you can eat sushi this was much better quality and the rice was a minimum versus other places that pack on the rice.  Service was quick, efficient and friendly. Get a booth because they're both comfy, private and the wood tables are gorgeous."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT! Our cook \"Chad-Man\" was so funny and entertaining and cooked our food Perfectly! We loved it and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Brought my family here when it first opened. Let's start with food is really good, waiter was awesome, hostess was real polite. Will recommend to friend and family!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and well priced for those thinking this place would be expensive!  My 3-year old loved the show and got to experience an environment of people laughing and enjoying the chef!  Definitely plan a dinner or party here. Super kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Great entertainment but food was a little bland for my taste. I had the New York strip, I do recommend you try it out and judge for your self."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to OhJah and looks like we officially found our chef!  If you decide to go to this location, make sure to request Chef Jason!  He's by far the most entertaining, very funny & great with kids to date!  Salad wit ginger dressing is phenomenal, the onion soup is to die for.  Fried rice(brown rice ), chicken & shrimp is my go to choice.  New York & Filet Minot is amazing too!  Never cared for deserts bcuz I'm already full! Portions are just right.  The price, I can't complain there!  Overall best experience, food and company(waiters) for the price can't be compared!  This is our #1 Japanese teppanyaki steak house ever!  U won't be disappointed if you get chef jason!"}
{"text":"very busy Saturday at 6pm- we were sat right away-Place was full and staff was moving in a scurried fashion-Priced moderately-hibachi selection were very moderately prices-large menu many options- we sat in dining room-my wife had asked for water three to four times before she received it. refills on Beer and Sake were slow most likey due to them being slammed earlier than expected this evening! Food took a while to come out and apps came with entrees? Manager apologized and told us kitchen was slammed- near by four top got three of four entrees and several apologies - and excuses- fourth meal came ten minutes after first three! Our food was presented very beautifully and was delicious! The server was very friendly and became more attentive as her section seemed to thin out. The decor is stunning and CLEAN! We really enjoyed it and will return- perhaps the Hibachi table next time!"}
{"text":"I am so glad my husband found this place! The waiter was so friendly and helpful! He convinced my husband to try something new which is a first!!! The chef was so nice and very very funny! It definitely gives dinner and a show a whole new meaning!!! We will being coming back every time we are in Vegas together!!! They deserve 2 thumbs up and if I had more thumbs I'd put them up too!"}
{"text":"Jimmy made the most delicious chicken ever and is our favorite chef! Fantastic food, great show, awesome customer service, and really reasonable prices. We love it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ohjah for nearly two years now, and I'm glad they opened a location closer to me. The food here is incredible. The \"Gentleman's Club\" roll is to die for. Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious. The sushi is fresh and good quality fish, some of the best I've had in town! The hibachi is great too."}
{"text":"Just finished up another annual office Christmas party with my Rainsprings peeps at our usual hang out.  Good times, really good food, and white elephant gift exchanging with lots of laughter!  Ohjah's prices are really affordable if you want the chef entertainment factor.  Portions are a lot better than others in town, but for the average guy you can feel a bit unsatisfied despite ordering two kinds of meats.  Servers are really nice and attentive.  Always a must if you're in the mood for this type of dining."}
{"text":"I'm new to this city and I'm glad that I found a hibatchi place to go to regularly. This place is relaxed and the people here are friendly. There hasn't been a time where our family had to sit and wait for a table. The hibatchi chefs are so entertaining, I love how they have smart and witty jokes... that are hilarious and make the show more enjoyable without overdoing it! One of my favorite spots. Keep up the good work! You guys are amazing"}
{"text":"Rude a** chef and waitress F this place I will never be back!!! Even the food was disappointing!!! I dont know how this place has 4 stars, probably made more then half of these review themselves!!!    Update - after all that bs I talked to the manager and he made me think about going back, he treated me an my family the way customers should be treated amazingly nice guy! Ill try it again after the 16th when the chef will leave to the other location!!"}
{"text":"If you love Benihana but think it's too expensive, this specific place is a great spot to eat! They have a restaurant AND a hibachi place where they cook in front of you. They also have AYCE Sushi!   This place is clean and the customer service is good. They have good and funny chefs in the hibachi side. The hibachi has ala carte so you have the option to create your own combo! Plus it's anywhere from $10-$20 cheaper with good quality food!! Definitely the place to eat more often!!!"}
{"text":"For the prices, this place does a great job. My boyfriend and I have been here on multiple occasions for the hibachi grill and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The chefs are very nice, and definitely are very skilled at what they do. They have a variety of things on the menu, so if you're not into hibachi they have sushi as well. I do wish you get more food, but honestly, the food tastes so good I don't even mind! If you want to enjoy the experience but not pay an arm and leg then this place is perfect for you. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The sushi was so good and fresh. The Show Me the Love and King Salmon rolls were amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here on a date with my boyfriend, casual lunch and another time for my nieces birthday; so this place is for all occasions. The hibachi grill chefs do a great job, and the prices are reasonable. The sushi here is also good, my personal favorite is the killer bee!"}
{"text":"My son and I have been here too many times to count. The main reason this place gets 5 stars in by book is Jason. He is the best Hibachi chef here. He cooks the food to perfection every time. The table servers/hosts make us feel rushed sometimes while we decide on what we want, or after our food has been cooked, but while Jason is entertaining us with his awesome skills and great personality we never feel like he's on autopilot like some other chefs are. That's why we make sure to request him every visit. Another great thing about him is how he interacts with the kids. My son falls for the ketchup trick every time.   I hope this place treats him as well as he treats their customers."}
{"text":"Service was good. Sushi in my opinion was not. I have been to numerous sushi restaurants and some of the sushi here is lacking. Bland...no flavor.   I didn't even finish my rolls.  My boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken entree, that was good.   But like I said, service was on point for me."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here this past weekend and I must say it was delicious! I'm a very picky eater and even I enjoyed the offerings here. I had the New York Strip steak and my girlfriend had the chicken. Both are recommended."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and coworkers. The ambiance and show were good.   I got the noodles, steak, chicken and salmon.  Everything was good, no complaints.  However,  I think Benihana is better."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, it was decently filled, hubby and I went with the hibachi combo, comes with soup, salad, rice, veggies and 3 meat choices. Soup was a typical consommÃ© topped with green onions, meh. The salad was great, very refreshing, though it was just an iceberg medley but the dressing was really delicious.  I went for the NY steak, shrimp tepan and scallops, while hubby went with NY steak, filet, and chicken. NY steak was tender, but it seems like it had been sitting in the chiller for a while, it had a weird taste to say the least. Filet was great, very tender, and it tasted like how beef should taste like. Chicken was chicken, nothing special. Shrimp was ok, a bit overcooked. Scallops, yet again perfectly seared, and very tender but it had a weird ammonia taste, will never order that again. Food, all in all was ok in proportion to the price tag. Just don't order the Kobe beef, 48 bucks for a 8 oz piece, if you're gonna pay that much, at least get that experience at Raku with Kobe and Wagyu beef.   Unfortunately, the food did not impress me, BUT the customer service did, our server Raelyn? Was phenomenal! Our drinks were always topped off, she was sure to ask about food allergies and was checking on us every now and then at polite intervals. I would've only given 2 stars coz of the food but the service gained them another star."}
{"text":"Love this place good lighting, great food, fat service and worth the price definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Very deceiving being in a strip mall but lovely inside. Very good service and the the food is very good. Love the pink lady roll. The cocktails are at least 9 dollars a little pricey but very tasty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now, and we always leave quite satisfied. The fish quality is great, and they have great dinner specials. I mean, 3 specialty rolls for $25.00 is a phenomenal deal! The service is always pleasant, and the restaurant ambiance is relaxing. If you are looking for good sushi at great prices, I recommend Ohjah."}
{"text":"Just got done with my first visit here. My boyfriend & I ordered kani nachos, the 3 roll dinner special, & chicken pad thai. I had big expectations of the kani nachos because of reviews. I was disappointed when I realized they weren't actual nachos & weren't on wontons but a pringle-like chip. The nachos were topped with spicy crab & avocado. The topping was pretty good. They would be much better if the \"chips\" were actually fried wontons. I saw pics from other locations & they look different than what we had so it may just be this location or maybe they were out of wontons the time we went. The pad thai also had good taste even if thai food isn't their specialty. The pink lady roll was yummy & my boyfriend enjoyed the dynamite & tiger roll. We will probably visit again & try more things."}
{"text":"Decently placed and traditional feel to it, not your typical sushi place though. would love to see an all you can eat option."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! This beautiful restaurant is fabulous! The Teppanyaki is so awesome, the sushi is excellent, I love it all. The people here are so nice, the decor is gorgeous, you must go here!"}
{"text":"Took my mother here with my fiance for an unexpected hibachi meal. Our chef was delightful and had some great tricks however I've had better as far as the flavors and quality go. The scallops were not really cooked well but our filet and shrimp were on point. Overall it's decent for the price but there are better places to go to in my opinion."}
{"text":"Been to multiple hibachi places! This was great but definitely not the best. Exceptional service however and very nice staff."}
{"text":"I haven't been to any of the other Ohjah locations, but I've been to this newest one twice at the hibachi grill in the last three weeks. They have pretty classic teppanyaki at very affordable prices along with a fairly large menu which includes sushi, Thai, noodles, and rice selections.   The atmosphere is relaxed with everyone having fun catching shrimp in their mouth and watching knife tricks. On our last visit, we came before the dinner rush on a Friday night around 6, and by the time we finished dinner, the bar and waiting area were full with overflow into the dining area so reservations are recommended, especially on the weekends.  My rare filet was so good from my first visit, that I ordered it again on my second along with a the You and Me sushi roll. The sushi roll was OK, but there are still some other items that I want to try. The chefs season the vegetables and the fried rice very well, which are items usually not too memorable for me. They're very receptive to requests of adding flavors such as butter, garlic, or sauces. And I've noticed the chefs are more interactive with the guests in general compared to other places I've been.  The price of my hibachi dinner was under twenty dollars. As long as I can contain the amount of sake and Sapporos that I consume, my wife and I can get out of here full and paying around $60 for dinner which price I like and will keep us coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I love this place. The hibachi area is entertaining and the cozy dining is rather cozy. I'm not a big tempura fan, but the sushi and other Japanese dishes are always delish."}
{"text":"We went to Ohjah for my sisters birthday. She nice there was only 6 of us we were seated with 2 other people (12 people can sit around one grill). The waitress came and took our order and headed off to get our drinks. She was very nice and attentive, great service.   The cook came out and verified our orders and cleans the grill. He started with the fire show asking is how big of a fire we wanted. We responded \"big\".  Then all of a sudden There was a big ball of fire hot enough to burn our eyebrows off. We clapped in enjoyment. He then started to cook our food and entertain us with his tricks and jokes. The kids loved it and we all had a good time.   The food was just ok. We ordered a variety of things like chicken, steak and shrimp. Our orders came with vegetables and a choice of fried rice or noodles. The noodles were not that good. They seemed like spaghetti noodles and didn't have good flavor. The fried rice was better. The chicken was blah. I wish I got the steak or shrimp.  Overall we had a good time and that was good enough for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this restaurant.  We took a chance and wen there for our daughter's graduation dinner.  We were so impressed that we have been back 5 times.  The show is pretty much the same every time but the food is just great.  The staff is very friendly and always make sure you are taken care of.  Don't let the location fool you, it could be in one of the casinos on the strip, but it is a nice out of the way spot instead."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Our server Cody was always on top of it. Then, I couldn't stop laughing because of our chef. It was a dinner and a show. My family and friends enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of butter and soy sauce our chef used, but it was enjoyable. I'm just a health freak haha.   If you order the shrimp, the chef plays a little game with you where he throws the shrimp. Then, he makes a volcano and train out of the onions. You'll see when you come ha.   The hibachi consists of onion soup, house salad, your protein, and choice of fried rice, brown rice, and noodles."}
{"text":"Do the 25.95 dinner special.. We ordered that and the baked mussels and Kani nachos and my fiancÃ© and I both left full!! Their fish is super fresh and their rolls are very flavorful!! We will definitely be back or maybe visit the one closer to home on Hualapi.."}
{"text":"Have been at this location twice and the pahrump location many times. Always excellent service and the food experience is incredible   The staff is very friendly and  efficient"}
{"text":"Oh where do I begin! The staff are so nice and after only 3 visits they remember my family, what we drink, certain food allergies, etc...  Johnny and Jason have top notch service.  The food!!!! The food is perfect every time.  The fish is fresh and beautifully designed in each dish to compliment the sauces. Dessert plates as big as dinner plates!! I love this sushi spot, definitely a gem hidden off the strip.  The restaurant itself is designed perfectly with different table styles to accommodate dinner occasions. You have to check this place out!!! Ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"I ate here with a group of 10 for my boyfriends birthday. We sat at the hibachi grill and Cody was our server. He informed us that they had a deal going on, buy 3 saki bombs, get one free. We all had multiple rounds and were definitely keeping Cody busy. He did a great job keeping up with everything we asked for and went above and beyond for us! He was very personable and made us have a great time! Our cook, Jason, also did a phenomenal job! I have done hibachi many times and know most of the jokes by now, but Jason did a great job and surprised me with some new jokes that's aren't commonly used else where. Not only was the staff here great but the food is AMAZING as well! Needless to say we will definitely be back because of our incredible food and service!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a new sushi place to try and I'm glad we did! Great service which is always a must, amazing atmosphere (very helpful) and prices/menu specials are affordable.   First time here and our server was very helpful.   All of our rolls came out fast and fresh.   Wine was fantastic and average priced, great beer too!  Always ask yourself what are you looking for in a sushi place? Then look for the reviews that match your expectations! That way your NOT disappointed.  I highly recommend this place because it hit everything I mentioned was perfect!"}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the BEST food I have had in I can't even remember how long!  Every single dish was fantastic. The drinks were delicious, and the bartender can pour! We had an array of things, chicken egg rolls, oysters on the half shell, chicken katsu, teppanyaki steak(which melted in our mouths like butter) soup, 4 aces roll was the best sushi I have had in years and no rice! EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.  We'll be regulars and bringing the whole family!"}
{"text":"Beef skewers were burnt and so tough and inedible. Chicken skewers are tasteless frozen breast shoved on a stick. Thai curry was super spicy even at 4 out of 10 stars - still pretty tasty.green tea was hot and wet, not much to say about that. Decor was nice a typical Japanese fusion. Dust falling of the light fixture wasn't too cool either."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give Ohjah a 10 star rating. Me and my fiancÃ© went in on a Friday and had Chad Man as our hibachi and he was amazing! Food was very fresh and delicious. Chad Man was personable and hilarious. We will continue to go to Ohjah and get Chad Man as our hibachi. The soup and salad came out almost immediately, followed by our sushi and hibachi. The waiter was on top of drinks throughout the meal. Just an overall great experience. Chad Man, you're the best!!"}
{"text":"Tried the hamachi here with friends... it was entertaining and scary at the same time. I kept wondering if any of the customers have caught on fire or have been dismembered with flying utensils but we survived. Food was pretty good too and much cheaper than Beni Hanas."}
{"text":"The food, the ambience, and the service is amazing! We had been here once before, but we sat at a booth, so we felt like a second experience was needed before I wrote a review because we wanted to try something different this time around by sitting at the Hibachi tables. Just like the first experience, our second time here was just as amazing! Everyone is so friendly, our server was incredibly helpful by giving great suggestions and answering all of our questions, our chef was so entertaining, and the manager was very kind. We enjoyed the Hibachi table just as much as we enjoyed dining the first time we were here. We left happy and completely stuffed. We will definitely be back again! :)"}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Sat down in the dining room and ordered chicken teriyaki which was so tough I could barely chew it. Also ordered the Spicy tuna roll which I absolutely love at other places and here it tasted like the tuna was old and bland. Edamame is basically impossible to screw up so I ended up ordering that and left there starving.   The waitress barely said two words to us and didn't even let me know what types of soups they had when I ordered the dinner special ( which comes with a soup and salad). No interaction with us at all. We should've had the hibachi which was packed and at least I know the food is fresh. I heard this place was the \"best\" Japanese cuisine in town and it was far from it. Maybe I'll come back one more time and try the hibachi instead."}
{"text":"Jason our chef is above and beyond amazing!!! Susan our waitress is above and beyond amazing!! The manager is so sweet. This place is A1. I had the steak and lobster with scallops. I usually do the sea food well done my steak medium well. Hot sake is a must. Wonderful place. My #1 choice in Henderson."}
{"text":"Delicious tuna tartare! the habatchi is always on point! good service in a central location, try the plum wine if ur up for a sweet wine."}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing experience for the service to the food! We celebrated my daughters 13th birthday and she had a great time..."}
{"text":"Standard teppanaki fare. I really like that you don't have to pay for their combos and can get the teppanaki a la cart. The chef's have many tricks but it's hit or miss as to which ones really have the flair. The food is good but not very healthy considering the amount of butter and oil in everything. Still for a once in a while treat the kids love it!"}
{"text":"I would have given them a 3.5 but it wasn't truly a 3 star. We have been wanting to try this place since it opened but waited until the crowd died down.  The food, service, and atmosphere were good. We started our dining with vegetable tempura. It was amazing and I think I could have eaten 2 orders and be full. Our entrees were teriyaki chicken, miso soup, salad, and rice I upgraded to fried rice for $2 more. The filet mignon teriyaki with miso, salad, and brown rice.  The chicken was as expected not to die for but good. The filet was cooked well and tender but again not to die for. If your into fried rice its worth the upgrade. Both of our meals were good and we would be back since it's so close to home.   The biggest problems we had with the restaurant was the entrees weren't very hot (temperature) and when I called to make a reservation I requested the tatami and they said since it was only 2 of us it would need to be a $200 minimum. What is this the strip? That was a joke! Especially since it wasn't even busy.   We did notice that a couple got the sushi boat! That looked dank... we will have to try that next time."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to this place about a month ago and got to use it with the b/f on a Thursday night after the gym.  - Located in the same shopping plaza as Cost Plus, Aaron Bros., and Barnes & Noble, on Rainbow, between Lake Mead and Smoke Ranch. - From the time we walked in to the time we walked out, service was excellent. - We opted for the hibachi dinner.  Hing was our chef and we had him all to ourselves.  He was very entertaining and had some mad skills with the utensils, swirling and swinging them as well as making the food catch fire, in a good way. - I had the shrimp and chicken combo dinner, which came with soup (onion or miso) and a small salad to start.   - Brown rice is available! - 5 ounces of chicken and at least 4 ounces of shrimp for my dinner.  Mel got the filet mignon and salmon for his. - Vegetables included mushrooms, onions, carrots, and broccoli. - Everything was very tasty. - For his finale, Hing did that thing where he tries to catapult a piece of food into your open mouth.  For us, he took one of my shrimp, cut it into three pieces and flung one piece at the b/f.  Missed on the first try, made it on the second.  My turn:  missed and the shrimp piece landed in my napkin--I ate it. - Our dinner came to $52 minus the $40 Groupon = deal.  AND, they gave us a $10 gift card to use on the next visit! - The place is very nicely decorated and spotless.  Even the bathroom is elegant and pristine. - We agreed that we'd return; next time, we'll try the sushi, but it probably won't be as exciting on that side of the restaurant unless Hing has mad skills with nori."}
{"text":"It really says something when the line is out the door at 7PM on a Sunday Evening. Luckily we had a reservation. It seemed they were short handed on Hibachi chefs, but, no problem. We didn't get in a real big rush. We just took our time and enjoyed. Our chef Ken was wonderful. It made it fun to watch and great to eat. 5 People with appetisers and full dinners was only $125 with tip. 3 of us had the filet mignon.  The service was fast and well done. Thank you for a great evening."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Japanese steakhouse. I've been to several, and this one seemed especially clean and well-maintained. The food was good, but if you are coming to a place like this, you are really coming to be entertained.   Our chef was very exceptional, and did a great job for the whole table. Sometimes you run into a chef that is very obviously bored with the routine, and just trying to survive it all. Not the case here. I was very pleased with that.  If you are in the mood for some great steak and noodles prepared table-side, then you've found your place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I came with a group of 10 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner. We all ordered ed hibachi dinners and they were awesome! All meals start off with a salad with a creamy ginger dressing (very tasty but a tad too mayonnaise-y for my taste) and miso soup and come with veggies and rice. I ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. Everything was very tasty! The meat was cooked just right and the rice was delicious. Others from our group ordered the lobster, chicken and scallops and everyone was pleased with their meals. I tried one of the scallops. It was very large and extremely tasty. I'd definitely order scallops next time. We all had sake which was tasty as well. The restaurant gave the bride and groom a cheesecake dessert for their celebration. The chef was entertaining and very funny. I'd definitely recommend this place and will be back next time I'm in town visiting again!"}
{"text":"I also was a first time visitor using a Groupon.  I have to One-Star them because they refused to honor the Groupon.  I print Groupons the day I buy them as a physical, visual reminder to use them.  My day of purchase printed Groupon clearly stated on its face that it's expiration date was December 5.  I ate at the restaurant on December 5, and the management falsely claimed that the Groupon was expired. Beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management, the food was very mediocre IMHO.  The chicken teriyaki was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would buy by the bag at costco or sams club, cooked barely long enough to no longer be raw, with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  The salmon teriyaki was the same story.  The yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction, too much salty seasoning.  The decor is very nice, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe, but the mediocre food and bad Groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since they opened. I called today for reservations it is Father's Day! They where not able to get me an appt at 8pm I understood because of the day. So I hung and decided to call back and place a Hibachi order so I give my order of two Hibachi dinners one lobster and sea bass and lobster and  filet mignon with rice and a blue diamond dinner for pick up and the only request I have is that Jason make my to go order and the gentlemen that answered the phone said he could allow Jason to cook my food I always take care of your staff when I am in there. I have spent a lot of memories there and I don't think they are that busy to throw some food with the rest of the food they are cooking isn't that what the chef is paid to do and went to hibachi school for. I feel I should of been treated better. I have had a $25 sea bass burnt and that is why I requested because I new it would be cooked right!"}
{"text":"Like the sushi.  Hibachi was average but I loved the stir fried brown rice.  Service was slow but my customer neighbor at the table said this was unusual.  Spacious family restaurant w/nice bar and huge menu.  Other Japanese and Asian selections are available on the cooked-food menu."}
{"text":"It's been more than six months that I have eaten at Ohjah. The first time was at the Flamingo location which the food was awesome. Well I'm back in Vegas and was happy to find out that there was an Ohjah near my hotel. I visited them in hopes that they would be just as good as the other location. I was not disappointed. The sushi was delicious.   I am knocking off 1 star due to the waiter not coming by once to ask how my meal was or if I wanted more water. I had to ask for more water when he came to take away the plates. Other than that, you can not go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"So we got this cooker named Chad three nights ago and let me tell you he was AWESOME. We haven't laugh like that in a while. Definitely go back because of him (Thanks Chad)! The food was really good.  We will come back"}
{"text":"Went with the family and really enjoyed the food and ambience.  Kids loved the hibachi show and the food was delicious.  Server was kind and always had a smile on her face.  It was our first time and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thanks to the Yelpers rec. of Chef Chad for a stellar experience. This dude is a true champ at what he does and he had the entire table fully engaged with his show. The food was very good (and plenty) but the Artful comedy and cooking of Chef Chad made it a memorable and special evening.  While we waited for our chef, we started out with Sex on the beach sushi roll which was excellent. We both ordered the 3 item combo with shrimp, scallops and filet mignon. We had a choice of rice, fried rice or fried noodles. We both enjoyed the fried rice and noodles. All the food was plentiful and very tasty at a moderate price. (Beats hell out of Benihana)  Make sure you ask for Chad when you make your reservations. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"The welcome staff here can be hit or miss on whether they are going to be happy and accommodating or grumpy and not  but we have always left happy because of the yummy food and good wait staff. The way you order your meal is a little different then most places you go, other places you go you pick your meal for instance chicken and steak and it's 24.99 and you know rice, salad and soup is coming with it but here you order your base which is fried or steamed rice, salad, soup and veggies with your meal and that's 8.99 then you pick your meats and they have a list of meats or seafoods to pick from with their prices listed so you add your meat and your base price then you get your total meal price. I kind of like the way they do this because if you just want one or the other and not both your not charged the huge fee and a bunch of food your not going to eat.  I'm always impressed with how fast the salad and soup come out and usually the chef comes out within 5 minutes of ordering. We have been here 4 or 5 times and we have never been disappointed by our chef they all have been entertaining and friendly. One in particular we really you loved and I wish I could remember his name but he included our 2 year old in the show and made her feel like part of the group by giving her pieces of veggies and a little bit of fried rice of her own (we don't order for her since she just picks off of our plates) we appreciated that so much because most people just pretend she's not there and interact with our 8 year Olds. We have never been disappointed by our food everything we have ordered has always had great flavor and left us saying wow that was a great meal. We also aways order a sushi roll which always comes out tasting fresh and yummy my favorite roll is the love roll. It's a must try if you love sushi you will thank yourself for it! All in all this is a definite must try."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, and kid friendly. This is my second favorite place to bring my 4 year old. I really appreciate the patience of the staff."}
{"text":"Finally decided to drop in here and try out their hibachi dining after reading all the great reviews. Easy to get a seat as a solo at 5pm, I joined a small family celebrating their daughters birthday. At the other table was another family celebrating Grandma's birthday. I'd say the birthday girls were about 60 years apart in age, yet chose the same place on the same night......(insert spooky music)  I'm a huge fan of hibachi dining (teppanyaki) and have had many meals here and all over the US and world. The chefs are all good, but the show is running a little stale (how many onion volcano's can you see?) Someone needs to take it up a notch with some new jokes besides egg roll.  Anyways...on to the food. Pretty good. I had the combo with filet, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki salmon. All cooked perfectly. Just lacked some flavor. As did the opening salad, the soup (not miso), the dipping sauces, the fried rice....all of it lacked an exciting flavor. So my 3 stars is mostly for the flavor of the food. Service was great, 5 stars. The chef was great, 5 stars.....Just the food needs to get punched up a bit and add some new seasonings besides basic salt, pepper, and butter.   Its a nice restaurant, with a sushi bar as well. Its definitely a great price ($30.95 for the combo) which is lower than Geisha, Osaka, and others."}
{"text":"One star for easy parking and ample waiting area. I made reservations a week ago, they lost it. The host offered no compensation. Only said, \"You can have the next Hibachi seating in 45 minutes.\" Yeah, no thanks. You lost my reservation, you lost my business."}
{"text":"Great value, friendly service and awesome sushi.  They offer special sushi rolls for $24 and they were really good makis. Calamari tempura was good too and they make poki to order.  This is a great find."}
{"text":"Was very happy after eating at this place. Food was great and I thought the pricing was more than fair. Loved all of it and our chef was so fun!"}
{"text":"I've had the worst experience two night ago here at ohjah I went to take my best friend out since I haven't seen her in forever so I'm like hey let's get sushi and some hibachi keep in mind I been here with family had a wonderful experience but this time was so different idk if it's because we are in our early 20's or what but they treated us like crap  1st we get there standing at the door for about 10 minutes two guys are just talking then finally one comes over do you want the show or a booth I choose both guy sits us then disappears for awhile we are sitting there already know what we want to eat blah he asks if we want a drink I say water with lemon for both he brings it and leaves comes back 10 minutes later do you finally know what you want like uhh yeah I already knew what I wanted before coming in and we tell him he says uhhh you might want to choose something cheaper my friend ordered a bunch of sushi rolls again I have the hibachi then he asks me is this going on one or two bills before the foods even came out I'm like 1 bill since you know I'm taking my friend out to dinner  so he's all like hmm walks away it's been about 15 minutes since they bring my friend her sushi then 10 minutes they bring my soup and salad after my friend already basically ate all her sushi still haven't got my rice and shrimp veggies sit there waiting for that and finally guy comes 1 it was cold 2 there were only 6 shrimp on my plate and the veggies gave were basically only mushrooms and then they guy went to bring the bill and was acting as if I couldn't handle the bill tell me why it was only 60 bucks I was prepared to pay over 100 dollars at this place I was treated very poorly and it's sad because I loved this place when I went before but you can trust me when I say I'm not going back they acted like if me and my friend were going to dine and dash I make pretty damn good money for my age and I felt disrespected wouldn't give any stars if they didn't make me"}
{"text":"Of course im sitting in another sushi place wishing I was here !!!I wish you guys would do extended hours !!! After all IT IS VEGAS !!! THE STAFF HERE and can't eat any sushi joint in town without comparing to YOU GUYS!!!! YOUR SUSHI HAS DEFINITELY LEFT A MARK IN OUR TUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"Great habachi place the food is always good and the employees are always nice and funny. It's also a good priced place for the amount of food you get.  It has a great atmosphere and it's a fun place to visit."}
{"text":"I was driving by one day and decided to stop by and give Ohjah a try.  The staff was quick to serve and polite.  Even better was the sushi. The fish tasted so fresh and clean, the portion sizes of the roles and slices of the fish were larger than average, and the prices were reasonable.  To top it off, they served us complimentary hot sake during our meal.   What more could you ask for?  I think I found my new favorite sushi place.  I highly recommend Ohjah!"}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to come get a quick bite to eat here and we sat at the sushi bar. Tien was our sushi chef for the evening and he was fantastic. Very kind and professional. Tien even gave us complimentary orange slices with plum liquor on top! I love this place! If you are coming here by yourself of with a couple of people I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar. We ordered the cowboy, spicy Mexican, volcano, and the French kiss roll. All the rolls came out perfect!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my boyfriend and I eat here all of the time, and usually have an amazing experience. We have spent birthdays, date nights, and graduations here. I've brought friends and family here and also got them hooked. However, the service is seriously declining. Last Sunday we came for my boyfriends birthday and our hibachi chef was clearly drunk (not surprising since you can constantly see the hibachi chefs drinking on shift). It is OK if they do a saki bomb with a guest every once and a while, but the amount of drinking by the employees thats going on at this place is starting to become trashy. My boyfriend and I sat with a larger party (not with us) and I believe that he even made them uncomfortable. He consistently continued to make jokes about the fact that my boyfriend and I are in an interracial relationship, myself white, my boyfriend black. While we are the type that enjoy a good laugh it started to become too consistent and made everyone at the table uncomfortable. He talked about what our kids will look like, asked how did my boyfriend get me, asked how our parents reacted to our relationship. UM its 2018 people and were paying customers!! Consistent paying customers at that. He also made comments about black people stealing newport cigarettes???? Totally bizarre things to be discussing as a hibachi chef. He also admitted to being drunk, forgot my noodles, forgot the other parties chicken (had them bring out chicken from the back that wasnt even cooked on hibachi) and forgot their shrimp. The only reason that the review is still so high is because we've had other great experiences here, but we will likely go to another location. We just wanted to sit and enjoy a hibachi show... not be the show, or the joke of the show by being interracial. As we left he yelled \"happy anniversary\" and the other individuals we sat with were like, \"no, it was his birthday.\" Just proving how totally loaded this guy was.. Highly disappointing since this is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A discerning diner wanted to introduce me to Ohjah, so I accepted the invitation to dine here with Diane and our host couple.  And, throughout the night I was quite pleased with the very brisk and attentive service and the quality and preparation of food served here, as well as the sophisticated Asian ambiance of the premises.  A medium-size Rainbow Roll was fine, and hot Calamari Tempura excellent.  Onion Soup was tasty, but with only a couple of curlicues of Green Onion circling about in the broth, about as basic as it could be.  The salad was more complex, and was a refreshing start.  Fried Rice with egg was nicely seasoned, and surprisingly included in lieu of Steamed Rice at no additional charge.    When the entrees were plated, my medium rare Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly to order and melted in the mouth.  And my accompanying double order of shrimp featured very big and succulent plump shrimps that would have been fun to chomp down on had there not been so many to devour!  I had never before seen shrimp this large sizzling on a teppenyaki grill.  Al dente vegetables, including mushrooms, were good.  The grill master put on a good show, but the tricks were fairly standard except for suddenly pulling back a bowl of rice extended on a spatula just as a diner opened his hands to grasp it.   A well-deserved 4-1/2 star overall rating this initial time out!"}
{"text":"Both times we have came in we never waited and service and food was perfect! It's a big restaurant and extremely clean... All staff is awesome especially Henry the chef! He went above and beyond with our food and was truly so kind...food was delicious! By the way my boyfriend did get served more meat than in the picture, but we thought of taking pictures after a few bites lol!"}
{"text":"OMG they really work as a team really fast Turn and Burn Hibachi tables customers leave two three minutes later it's ready for the next round just a remark for previous Yelp reviews I couldn't tell there Japanese Chinese Korean it doesn't make any difference unless you are on the really high in place chicken is chicken and the soy sauce is the same They always overcook  to my steak is the same in all tampiyaki grill even if I ask please don't kill my steak ... any ways the show is always nice . Customer service well you're working too fast and that's what compromise few things by the way my reservation that I made yesterday got lost somehow but that was able to send me on the next table all the tables was full portion a little smaller than I expected."}
{"text":"Great place,good friendly people ,service and food is always GOOD!!. We are coming again in the near future."}
{"text":"First time here.  Three adults and 2 kids.  We had so much with Chef Chad Man. The \"White Guy\" as he refers to himself is a riot. He was so good with the kids and made some tasty food for all at the Habichi Grill. Definitely a place we will be returning to.  It is so affordable and you can get sushi at the table and grill along with your dinner."}
{"text":"Some of the best hibachi I've had. The filet was tender, juicy, and flavorful. All the veggies and rice were cooked to perfection. Gyoza was on point. The spicy tuna rolls were quite good. Finely diced cucumber and tuna, all fresh and flavorful. I'll be back. Service was good all around."}
{"text":"They have both A regular restaurant and sushi area as well as the hibachi/teppan section. Both are excellent. Good service. Good flavor. Number one go to place for us now."}
{"text":"**WOULD NOT RECOMMEND; WILL NOT BE RETURNING** the chef JASON was very rude to me! he was throwing veggies in everyones mouth & i politely told him \"no thanks\" as i wasn't comfortable doing that. i got a text msg & he continued to harass me saying, \"get off  your phone, stop catching pokemons\" while everyone at the table busted up laughing. i was humiliated. then when it got to our steaks of course i was the only one who wanted mine well done, in which he gave me super attitude saying he would mail it to me & that i was not as easy as the others. ive been to several places like this & never once had anyone say anything due to me liking my steak cooked longer. im sorry, but is this not your job? am i not paying $80-$100 for my dinner, am i not able to have my steak cooked the way i want to eat it? he continued to embarrass me while making the other diners laugh at my expense. when i had enough i just got up & walked out. they tried charging my husband the $84 & offering a $40 gift card. WHY WOULD I WANT TO COME BACK?? finally the owner who was a nice guy, refunded us our money since we told him we had no plans on coming back. FYI - maybe you shouldn't insult the person who would be leaving you a TIP!!! also, it was my husband's BIRTHDAY & we spent it not eating anything since our appetite was ruined & i was left crying due to the service i received."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and awesome food. My husband and I are out for Valentine's dinner and it is just a very nice experience. Not my first time but first without the kids and it is worth me getting on my phone and posting right now."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. This place has great food and great service! Both obviously really important  when seeking a new restaurant. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Sit and do the hibachi, fun experience, go see Henry and Cody!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner.. The food was fresh and came out quickly.  The tempura was light and crispy and not overly greasy like so many.  Our server was delightful.  I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"One thing I cannot stand is being rushed at dinner, and that's exactly what happened at Ohjah.  We had a reservation for 5:00 and arrived early. We were seated at 4:55 and noticed that the other diners at the hibachi table already had appetizers and drinks.   The waitress (Susanna?) came over and gave us our menus and asked what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order. She was not the least bit friendly. We hadn't even opened the menus yet. We placed our drink orders and the soup and salads were placed in front of us and the other guests. She brought our drinks and again asked what we wanted to order. It was a really bad way to start our dining experience.   The food and the hibachi chef were good but nothing exceptional. One thing I don't like is getting all the components separately. I had finished each one before the next was ready. First came the fried rice, then the meat (which was a small portion) and then veggies were last. The check was brought before we were even finished eating or offered a dessert menu which I had to ask for. We actually left a little hungry.   We were rushed out at 5:50, Im guessing so they could seat the 6:00 guests. I thought it would be a nice relaxing dining experience but I was very wrong. Don't see any reason to return here."}
{"text":"We sat at a booth for 15 mins and no one came to our table to help us!!!!!The waiter at the booth behind us came to see the party twice and not a soul came to us"}
{"text":"Fun environment, entertaining, kid friendly, food is great, & enough seating for everyone! Most would relate this to another type of restaurant. Friendly staff, quick service! This restaurant is for sure a dine in experience. Most spend about 1-2 hours here if you ask for the hibachi show dining. If you like sake the peach sake is really yummy as well as the white sake sangria!"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in North Vegas for sure! Ohjah sushi always has the freshest ingredients, and the service is great.  There are many rolls to choose from, as well as pork katsu, chicken teryaki etc...  My roommate and I both have boyfriends that don't eat sushi, so this is our weekly place to go get away from the boys. It's always quiet, the booths are private, and the rolls come out in a timely manner.  Last time we ate here, we got the 3 roll special,  we got to choose 3 rolls from the list for 24$. We chose the Volcano roll (good, served wirh imitation crab salad and tiny scallops on top)  Spiderman roll (perfect! My favorite, with eel, and garlic crunchies on top) Show me the Love roll ( a little spicy, salmon and avocado on top).  We also ordered the tempura banana (delicous) and the red bean mochi (different)   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SUSHI RESTAURANT !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service, and great prices! We had the hibachi grill. The chef was excellent...very skilled and quite personable. The server was courteous, attentive, fast, and efficient. The food (chicken, filet mignon) was delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would have liked (and I should have asked for) would have been hot mustard to go along with the meats (I love hot mustard). But, everything was as perfect as can be.  I've been to quite a few other hibachi grills in Las Vegas and around the U.S. (New York, Honolulu, Orlando, etc.), but none can match the value of Ohjah (I'm almost tempted not to post this, since I'd hate to see the prices go up...LOL).  It really is as good as the other reviewers have posted and we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Ordered the hibachi salmon of which came out perfectly crisp on the outside but most and tender on the inside- the teriyaki -lemon glass was light and tasty- my fiends had order envy. Also, the tables are Great for entertaining for business, and the restaurant does a good job controlling the table flow and the accompanying noise. If your eating low carb/keto ask for no rice but extra veggies!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Hibachi meals are delicious and entertaining.  Ask for Jason particularly with family.  Funny dude!"}
