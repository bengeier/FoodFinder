{"text":"The blue chip truck has amazing poutine. I don't know about anything else they serve because I've never tried it. Most of the price of a poutine order is the real cheese curds. Delicieuse. I usually try to share it with a friend since that lessens the caloric hit and because I can never quite finish a whole one.   I also find that they put on a little too much gravy for my tastes, smothering the bottom layer of fries. I keep meaning to offer to pay extra for a second cardboard boat for them to put the gravy on, but I'm usually too shy in the moment and forget. One day.  In summary: POUTINE POUTINE POUTINE"}
{"text":"I've tried some of the other chip trucks around but this one has some great fries. They don't feel super greasy when they are served crisp and fresh to you. And they are cut daily by the truck staff themselves (unsure if in truck or prior to parking at St. george). The hot dog was fine and i used the variety of condiments (incl. Cajun spice) to customize it myself. I like how they have good options for the hot dogs (incl. Halal) and the poutines. I have yet to try the poutine however."}
{"text":"Favourite food truck in the area, prices can't be beat and food is always hot and fast."}
{"text":"This is a perfectly acceptable food truck to eat at if you happen to be very near/passing by it. It is not worth hunting down, searching for, or otherwise actively getting to. Don't get me wrong: it's not bad, just not exceptional or warranting anything more than three stars.  I ordered a chicken burger and a poutine; the former because I was warned off of their hamburgers by Avitania B., and the latter because the other reviewers have raved about them. The chicken burger was acceptable, but not special. There was no mayo available, the lettuce was somewhat wilted, and the tomatos were nothing to write home about. The chicken itself was tender but also was deep fried: don't expect this to be a healthier option! The bun was unexceptional as well. I've had remarkably worse chicken burgers in the city (such as down along the waterfront) but being 'not-the-worst' isn't exactly high praise.  The poutine wasn't bad. It's not something that you could really rave about unless (a) you dismiss the potential for getting excellent food from a food truck; (b) you've never had truly excellent poutine. I have had excellent food from a food truck before, preventing me from taking advantage of (a), and my numerous Quebecois colleagues have spent so much time teaching me about poutine (and finding me the good stuff along the West coast) that I can't fall back on (b) to help spruce up my review.  So, how was the poutine? It was ok at best. They do use a healthy amount of curds, though none are so fresh that they squeak, nor will they all be hot or even warm by the time they get served to you. This is exceedingly disappointing because you get nice hot fries and gravy that are contrasted by very cold cheese. The fries themselves aren't bad - far better than most fast food restaurants, for sure - but lacked anything that made them truly special. The same can be said of the gravy: it would stand out against something from Burger King but lacked the hearty richness that I really look for in a gravy. It was also somewhat lacking in salt, though I admit that saltiness of gravy is often a pretty subjective thing.  So, would I go there agin? Maybe, if I was walking by and happened to be hungry. I wouldn't go out of my way to get food from it (as I did this time) and would suggest that there are far better places around this area of get your fill of fast and cheap food."}
{"text":"My favourite food truck of all time!   The guys here are sweet, and sort of genius. I've seen them take up 15 orders at a time, remember them perfectly and then hand them out in order. I used to go here once a week for poutine. Then I got fat, and decided to cut it down to once a month.   I would definitely recommend this truck for all your unhealthy meal needs."}
{"text":"What can I say?!? Cheap, plenty and good junk food. The portions are generous. See pic of poutine. That was a small."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! The two guys are friendly, their stuff tastes amazing for the price,  there really isn't much else to say. One complaint though is that they don't label their sauce containers (the ones just inside the widow). That means I have to try the sauces one by one until I found the honey mustard. Otherwise it's fantastic."}
{"text":"At $4 for a small poutine with real curds and beef gravy, it's a pretty good deal, especially if you've got a craving to fix. Was it the best poutine I've ever had, no. It was definitely tasty though. I appreciate that the whole mess (if your poutine isn't a mess, they're doing something wrong) was hot enough that the curds were melty. I'm not a fan of squeaky curds.   I can see why U of T students rave about this place."}
{"text":"Usually parked in front of the Astronomy and Astrophysics buildings at the University of Toronto, it's hard to not notice this giant blue truck. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries from the super nice, mustachioed guys inside. They listened to classical music while the fryers were going, which was unexpected and quite nice. :)   First, the burger. Don't order one. It's wretched. Nasty mass-produced patty, Costco-quality bun, anemic slice of tomato, sad little lettuce leaf. I took one bite and tossed it.  On the other hand, the fries were the best I've ever had. I'm not kidding, they're absolutely delicious. They're chunky cut, skin on, and fried a crispy, beautiful brown. I don't care that the generous portion of fries probably equalled twice my daily calorie allotment. I ate every single one.   From the other people crowded around the truck, I learned that I should have had the poutine -- it's supposed to be fabulous. They also have hot dogs and sausages, which I hope taste better than their burger. That said, I'm actually looking forward to being on campus again on Monday just so I can eat more of their delicious frites. Yes, I'm crazy.  Crazy about the Blue Chip Truck! (Although next time, I think I'll bring a friend -- otherwise, by the end of the year I'll have my own show on the Discovery Health Channel: The Half Ton Grad Student.)"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get food from truck vendors is in New York City, and I must say that the truck vendors here in TO don't come close. But I recently found this truck vendor and I am pleasantly surprised.   I am attending school again at the U of T and this truck is right outside my class; it has been a stomach saver. I have had the hot dog, burger, and fries so all the staples. And they are all good choices, the food is made to order, the service is quick, and the gal was friendly to me;) I have gotten something from here almost every day of class. As I have mentioned the food is good and it is the only truck that comes close to the quality of New York City.   I have enjoyed my food here and I intend to eat here for the duration of my course at the University."}
{"text":"I've never seen this truck at UofT, but I do see it in front of City Hall on the time on Queen Street West.    I love coming here for lunch.  I like that there's a variety of options (hot dogs, sausages, hamburgers, chicken burgers).  The meat is always a good side, and cooked well.  I'm picky with fries, and I really like these ones.  Always fresh, hot and well cooked.  It's the cheapest lunch in Toronto.  The service is always fast and friendly.    They have all of your standard toppings.  I love that they also have the french fry seasoning and malt vinegar as well.  Soooo delicious.  I get the gravy (which is always free!) on occasion.  It's just the right consistency."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are the best thing here, but that's not really saying too much. the fries are not a good size or texture, and you're forced to put ketchup on all the fries at once instead of dipping them. would not recommend the burgers."}
{"text":"The cheap poutine served by this truck actually tastes better than what's served by many upmarket restaurants.   I was also a regular consumer of their sausages when I was a U of T student.  They operate at breakneck speed too - even during peak hours when the lines are long, I rarely waited over 5 min."}
{"text":"Great portions and prices! I always get their poutine :) Quick spot to grab something between classes at UofT."}
{"text":"The sausage and onion rings are soooo good and the wait is a lot shorter than the Chinese food trucks around so I come here when I want something faster.   The two guys are pretty pro. Sometimes I doubt their ability when they just say ok to like 5-10 orders in a row but they Always get them right!!!!!! Pretty crazy"}
