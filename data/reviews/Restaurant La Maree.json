{"text":"Found La Maree on our first night in Montreal.  The menu looked good and though it's a touristy location, we liked the outdoor seating and the view.  We had excellent service, with great recommendations from our waiter.  Weren't terribly hungry, so each got soup and split the scallops entree - they were amazing.  Seriously, some of the best scallops I've ever had.  Nice view, good food.  Nice way to kick-off a good trip."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. Can't believe I even left a tip for horrible dining experience. Having to ask water to be filled up 3 to 4 times and the waitress gives a nod but never arrives. Even ask for a glass of water when settling the bill. Does not arrive. Food lacked flavour and rice and vegetables that come out with their speciality dish is all same and generic. Save your money and calories and go else where. I have never ever had this sort of service before in Canada. Shame I can't give a zero star. (I don't normally write but had to do it to save others making the same mistake as I did)"}
{"text":"We had a lovely time in Montreal, but a TERRIBLE experience at La Marée. They literally kicked us out of the restaurant because we intended to ONLY spend $40-45 on appetizers, desserts and drinks.  Unless we wanted a full multi-course dinner with entrees, they did not want our business.  When we asked to speak to the manager, we were told he wasn't there. When we asked for his card, we were told he didn't have one. Then the gentleman who kicked us out PERSONALLY INSULTED me when I told him I would write the restaurant a negative review.  For the record, I never raised my voice. We were not boisterous customers. They simply didn't want to give a table over to a couple that might spend $30 less than someone else.  Of course, this all went down only after we waited (literally) at least 20-25 minutes for a waitress to even show up and speak to us. The ONLY bright spot of the experience was that their greeter successfully managed to greet us without insult."}
{"text":"Bland food, small portions, and overpriced. Nothing special about this place, other than its location. Food took forever to come out, especially my fish & chips, which arrived halfway through the others' meals. I seriously thought they would finish eating before my plate came. Two thumb-sized pieces of boring fish! Mother-in-law had chicken parm, her noodles were cold and bland. The lasagna looked OK. Crappy beer on tap. However, the server we had was great, her name is Catherine or Christina or something. But don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Very cozy and good service. The food was extremely tasty, especially the tiramisu and the vegetable soup.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauces were excellent."}
{"text":"Really some of the worst service ever. Food was ok. Something was crunchy in the Ceaser Salad. Mussels were ok.  Service was just so bad, very slow.  Not friendly. There are so many other places to go......keep walking"}
{"text":"horrible. tourist trap. the waiter smell like he had never bathed in his whole life. worst onion soup ever."}
{"text":"I should have read the previous reviews where they were stating how bad the service and the food is.   It was 3pm and the restaurant was fairly empty. We had waited for over 15 minutes  before someone arrived to wait on us.   Furthermore, when our server finally did arrived, upon finding out we did not speak French, his attitude towards us was very rude.   We placed our orders but they never arrived so we left. It is unfortunate that this restaurant is in a prime location but is marred by its extremely horrendous service.   The service was so bad, I think I might have gotten cancer!"}
{"text":"It was not an initial destination. We found out the other restaurant we had reserved was not suitable for a BD party and chose this one last minute. All average and even below average: food, service, drinks. The bill is not proportionate to the food (quality and quantity) I say. I liked the interior (furniture and wood decor) though. But this does not make me dine there again. The most irritating thing was confused waiters/waitresses. They would easily forget who ordered what. My partner's drink and food were served after everybody was indeed served. Finally there was a mistake in the bill and they had forgotten to include a drink! The only plus is the location I say. You can find much better places in the old port area."}
{"text":"Really shitty service. It  was really slow and we had to ask everytime we needed something and they would come back at us 15 min after. When we asked for the bill, the waiter came back with the terminal after a while he just left it on our table so I had to punch in the amount of our bill myself and swipe my card. So we decided to leave 2$ tips because it reflected the cheap service we receives and the waiter instead of feeling bad told us that next time we should eat at mcdonalds... And i'm not even talking about how the food tasted. I guess they dont really care since it's in the old port and there's tourists around"}
{"text":"We should have read the reviews first ... this place was awful.  They seat you, expect you to have your entire order, including beverages, ready when the server appears.  Water is served in plastic cups.  Then the meal, including salads, were served at the same time -- barely had enough room on our table.  My Caesar salad was soggy, including croutons, with a dressing that tasted like mayo in a bottle.  Steak was chewy, and when we asked for ketchup (for fries), the server tossed on the table a couple of small squeeze packets."}
{"text":"Horrible food, service restrooms, just everything. Nothing good to say about our expensive experience here to be treated like garbage and get overcharged,. Our food took over an hour and half and was over cooked and cold. I couldn't even use the restroom as it was filthy and disgusting with garbage overflowing, no toilet paper or soap, just filthy!  Avoid this place as there are way to many good restaurants in the area to be disappointed by this place. Hopefully the health board visits soon and shuts it down..."}
{"text":"Charming resturant, very good food. I'm from the state's, but my husband is from Montreal. In the past 27 years we have been to many restaurants together, but never this one. We sat outside as the weather was beautiful, but it was just as beautiful inside. Nice selection of wines and entrees"}
{"text":"Excellent carrot soup.  Their fish & chips is also very good.   The French Bordeaux red wine is also good.  Their service is friendly, but after giving food need to come and check after if you need anything."}
{"text":"This could be the worst choice I ever made. I rly want to give a 0 to this restaurant. There is rly no service at all. The waiters, they don't care about u and kind of mean to u. For food, we ordered salmon and steak. Next time, even if they give me $80(I spent $80 this time and are this terrible food) and ask me to eat, I'll definitely say no!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Unfortunately the poor service and inattentive staff left me feeling very unhappy with the experience."}
{"text":"The service was very good   The host was friendly and helpful. The location is amazing. We sat and had drinks while watching all the activity in the square. Our server was Christina - she was great! I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"One star only for the waitress and her service. Otherwise I wouldn't even have given that. Food, ambience and even restroom were horrible :("}
{"text":"Service: Really slow. Waited a good 15min before getting served. At some point I had to give an evil look to the waitress to order. It wasn't even busy... And when the bill came, she charged me the table d'hote instead of just the plate itself. Unfortunately for me, I have the bad habit of paying before even looking at the bill so I had to ask for my money back afterwards. The manager just looked at me and asked what would be the price difference and I answered 4$ each (I had paid for my own meal as well as someone else's so that would make it 8$). He then gives me 8$ in cash and left us. Now, technically speaking he owes me more than 8$ since he didn't even consider adding in the taxes and tip from the previous total. I was already too upset about my experience so I didn't feel like arguing for an extra 2$ refund.  Food: Other than the French Onion Soup, everything else was NOT worth the price. The Fish&Chips (in the menu it was written \"Fish&Chips with fries\"...) was nothing special and the Mussels&Fries were bland. The mussels didn't even have sauce on them. It tasted as if they just steamed the bucket and topped it off with green onions. We've had better elsewhere for way cheaper!  FYI: I'm usually not very picky with restaurants and food, and this is my very first review. So, it kinda gives you an idea of how displeased I am with this place."}
{"text":"We went to Maree last evening after spending the day in Vieux Monteal. We wandered around the square, know that all the restaurants were geared towards tourists. Our expectations weren't too high, but we wanted a place that had a decent selection for adults, and options for our kids.  My wife had the duck confit, and she thought it was well prepared. She tries it whenever possible, so she knows how she likes it. I had the moules, since I wasn't very hungry and didn't want a heavy meal. The children had pasta (of course).   The service was good; the waiter was around enough to grab him if needed, and he checked in often enough. I hate hovering waiters, so if you prefer to have someone check in after every bite, this may not be enough for you.  The food received thumbs up from everyone. I was a little concerned given how touristy the area looked, but I was pleasantly surprised. My mussels weren't overcooked, and my wife enjoyed the duck, The kids were satisfied, which pretty much means the pasta didn't' have \"extra stuff on it\".  The beer selection was meager, but my wife was able to get a Riesling by the glass, which made her happy.  The kids received desserts with their meals, and paid the \"parent tax\". The desserts were nothing special, but we still finished them.  The one thing which bothered me (even recognizing we were eating outside) were the number of flies around. The tables were clean, so there wasn't an obvious source. Since the porch is on a raised platform, I suspect the ground underneath isn't sufficiently cleaned.  Overall, I would say it was a perfectly good tourist restaurant in a touristy area. I can understand a lot of the negative ratings; I just did not have that experience."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  3 people asked us if we had placed our order.  My chair was broken when we were seated.  There was a bug in my water.  My husbands chicken came out cold. My burger came out under cooked and my bun was frozen.  They didnt even have ketchup for my fries.  There are so many options in this area and we made the $50 mistake of going here."}
{"text":"In the middle of the touristy section so it was packed. My mom picked this place because she just wanted to eat inside where there's air conditioning. Well, they do have it, barely though. One thing I've noticed in Montreal, they don't blast their AC like businesses in the States and they serve you room temperature water. We had to ask several times for ice- this place and the other restaurants we ate at.  The food was inconsistent-  The fried calamari was bad. It was soggy and was served with a weird dipping sauce. The fish and chips was okay. Two people from our group ordered mussels and they were delicious! The chicken and brie sandwich was good and the serving was good for 2 people.  The server was friendly. Checked on us a few times to see if we needed anything- more ice please!!   Are we going to eat here again the next time we're visiting, probably not. There's plenty of other places to try."}
{"text":"I typically don't write reviews unless an experience has left a strong impression on me. This place is so very disappointing when it comes to not only the food but also the service. They have the location going for them but apparently that's the only thing that keeps them confident. My girlfriend and I ordered salads which we waited over 40 minutes for. When we finally got the dish it was a big plate of iceberg lettuce with few other added ingredients (none that were fresh-rotten Tomatoes, overly boiled eggs), no dressing, and dry salmon (mine was most likely canned tuna). That waiters and waitresses also don't care to check up on their patrons regularly to ensure their dining experience goes smoothly. Besides the location, this place has nothing going for it. DONT go here! Unless of course you appreciate a subpar dining experience..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the small handful of five star reviews are coming from because this place is to be avoided at all costs. Most of the other stuff I've read about it has been spot on, that is to say not very good. It was pretty much the only negative dining experience during an otherwise wonderful summer weekend in Montreal.  It was getting a little past supper time and we were tired from all the walking so my girlfriend and I somewhat arbitrarily picked a place near the Old Port that seemed to have a decent looking menu and wasn't either completely dead (never a good sign) or totally packed. Sadly it's my guess that most of the other, better establishments were already full and that those that were here were just happy to find a place on a patio (we didn't even end up sitting outside).  First off let me say that the decor is simply atrocious...that's not something I often comment on when reviewing establishments unless it's highly impressive or highly offensive. In this case it was the latter. Old, dingy looking and inexplicably lined with grotesque paintings of dead animals. It didn't really offend me as a vegetarian rather so as an art critic. Ugh.  The food itself was nothing to write home about. I had an uninspired pasta and my girlfriend, a so-so salmon. The house wine was abysmal and the bread had to have been day old...there's no way it was baked that same day. If it was, something was clearly wrong with it.  Service was acceptable though not especially attentive either.  If you're in Old Montreal and want a nice dinner go elsewhere. Yelp would have really been my friend in this instance...I could have avoided La Maree."}
{"text":"Inedible food. I don't even know how this place has 1 and a half stars. The mussels stunk... Not like \"oh that stinks\" but they actually SMELLED. They stunk up the entire restaurant and frankly made me sick to my stomach. The service was horrible. We were ignored for the first 20 mins of sitting at the table. I ordered a Coke and it tasted flat. If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. Just writing this review and thinking of the place turns my stomach. If you see this place, keep walking. There are plenty of other places on Jacques-Cartier that are worth spending your money at. Don't waste your precious time and money here."}
{"text":"My family couldn't decide what we were in the mood for, and this restaurant has a little bit of everything.  We sat down, they brought bread and ask us for drinks.  I ask about the steak with scallop sauce and I am promptly told there is no steak. My dad orders a local beer.  The waiter comes back and says they also don't have the local beer.....we left."}
{"text":"Food portions were underwhelming for the price. Get the mussels for the most VALUE. Otherwise do not get the shrimp cocktail!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most regrettable dining experiences. As soon as we were seated I could sense something was off. Soon enough I got a taste of the conniving and insulting modi operandi used by the wait staff. Our waiter was completely aloof and acted like he was on crack. he never checked up on us and when he did 'interact\" with us, he had the most suspicious look on his face. The only thing that drew me to this tourist trap was the \"lobster bisque\" displayed on the outside menu. After confirmation from the waiter that the bisque was \"truly amazing\", I ordered it. When it arrived, I noticed there was absolutely NO lobster in it and it was super thin. I asked the waiter about this and he said the lobster is pureed. Really? You take something with such immaculate texture like lobster and pulverize it? If that really were the case it would not have been so thin. Anyway, I gave it a try and I can honestly say it was the most disgusting soup. Tasted like 80% water, 10% lobster broth and 10% metal from a can. And at $10, this attempt at bisque was just comical. After my one taste and my bf's confirmatory taste, I asked the waiter to take it back.  25 min later, my bf received his steak and fries. The steak was definitely over-sauced to mask its sub-par quality. When the bill arrived, I see that the lobster was not removed. When I inquired, the ignorant waiter said it could not be removed, but don't worry \"it can be in place of [his] tip\". Haha, did he think we were planning on giving him a $10+ tip? I asked to speak to the manager and he hesitantly went to get him. Some other employee then told me there was no problem with taking the \"bisque\" off the bill.  Our waiter was the bald late 20/early 30 year old guy. Note to the owner: you should fire him and work on your menu. I truly hope people see this review and do not waste their money here."}
{"text":"It was a nice place to eat. The outside patio where we sat was cramped,  but all restaurants appeared to have similar seating arrangements.  We had four adults and one child in our party. I would not recommend this restaurant if you're bringing children.  No childrens menu and asked if they could make a grilled cheese they wouldn't.  All of the adult entrees were delicious."}
{"text":"I truly believe their survival is due to their location. Terrible service, terrible food, and apparently they don't mind."}
{"text":"Great view and people watching, right in the center of things. Service was slow by American standards but fast for European. They were extremely accommodating and I had the best Greek salad all trip. Loaded with feta and olives. Plus the wine was really unexpectedly good for the price. Wish I would have found it earlier."}
{"text":"Look elsewhere. This was pricey, with a very limited menu that was not allergy friendly. Decent service but I would stay away given the abundant nearby alternatives."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Duck confit like cardboard smothered in BBQ sauce.  Bad Italian which did not taste like Italian, but what someone thought it might taste like.  Caesar salad was creamy but not tasty. Wine was also just awful, as if it sat around open for days before serving.  I want to say the wait staff was wonderful replacing my terrible wine with a glass not on the list of glass wines and not charging. They were attentive and sweet.    Go to another place. Really. Too many good restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my parents while on a trip to Montreal. The hostess & maitre d were very welcoming, there was outdoor seating, and the menu seemed extensive so we decided to give this place a shot.   They had a fixed lunch menu that came with dessert and we also had the option of ordering from the full menu-- so there were plenty of dishes to choose from. We ordered the chicken and brie sandwich, the salad with goat cheese and pecans, and the mussels. The salad and sandwich were average, but I highly recommend the mussels with the marinieres sauce... The white wine sauce was DELISH! Also the maple creme brûlée was also very very good.   Our waiter was very, very friendly. We were visiting from America and he made a point to converse with us whenever he had the time. He was funny and attentive.   If you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite, come here. The location is great, plus the food and service was on point !"}
{"text":"Writing this review as a warning - This ranked as one of the worst meals I've ever had.  French onion soup that was just gross - A pile of soggy onions.  Followed by walleye that was obviously frozen and had nothing but the flavor of some kind of green raw garlic mash sprinkled on top.  The place looks inviting, but I got sloppy and didn't check Yelp before going in.  Drowned my sorrows and washed some of the bad aftertaste away in the Ben & Jerry's across the way."}
