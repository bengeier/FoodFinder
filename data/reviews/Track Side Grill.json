{"text":"We eat at trackside several times a week now. Our workplace has fell in love with this restaurant. Good service and the wraps are great."}
{"text":"I typically buy gas at Clemmers Convenience Store which makes going to Trackside very convenient. I typically get food To Go and it is always very good. I do occasionally sit down and eat the service is good. One can get a full breakfast at Trackside for around $5 or $6 and it is made to order. Now days we pay that much for a drive thru breakfast and most often it is never made to order."}
{"text":"Frozen veggies inside my omelette, sent it back and got a new one. Same result. Haven't been back."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger and fries. Service good and friendly. Had meal quickly and to order. Food hot and presented well. Fries salty and had slight fish flavor. Burger was overcooked badly! Dried out but bun was fresh and tomato was good. Could have been much better burger had it been cooked properly."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service in the business sense, really sweet waitresses but the owner or whoever behind the scenes refused to cook a fresh pot of coffee- CRAZY at a breakfast place! The veggies were all canned and the hash browns are frozen. I hope this place makes more of an effort to cook fresh, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Take a chance and fill up great cozy place food is good home made cakes if your hungry give this place a try"}
{"text":"Trackside catered and supported a fabulous dinner for our school's Teacher Appreciation week. It was awesome! The vegetable lasagna is out of this world! They have fair prices and friendly staff. Overall, this is really a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Great little grill that I didn't realize was there until Facebook pointed it out!  Gals were super friendly, place was clean and food was good! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Like home cooking. Pancakes are good. Atmosphere is simple and pretty clean. Servers are personable and friendly. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and our food took only 11 minutes to arrive."}
{"text":"Food is expensive for no reason. A burger alone is $6 and that's with just adding cheese and maybe some bacon!!! The girls are always too busy talking amongst each other. Talking to the cooks that work in the background. They are never consistent with the desserts. They take forever to give you ur food. Smfh just not a good place to go to. When black's barbeque is down the block for cheaper AND Better. Even cookout is a better option than this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kick back southern dogs and burgers, fries are seasoned with old bay .. reminds me of the old days ...."}
{"text":"Bacon burger and fries. The service was friendly, however I ordered a bacon burger to go and there was no bacon! Fries were salty and burger was mediocre at best! (Could have went to cookout). The restaurant was very busy so something must be good just not the burger."}
{"text":"A place is cozy and warm. Food is good quality and cheap. Nice place. Everything is fine. I will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I would give the place4 stars but, my french fries were barely warm today.  The two specials, ham or turkey were very fairly priced even if the turkey was processed instead of fresh breast cuts.  For the price you can not find a better value!  The staff is always friendly and the service super fast.  If you have never eaten here give it a try."}
{"text":"A simple little short-order diner (with country music playing on the overhead speakers.) The decore is a bit minimalist.    I can understand the service being hit-or-miss depending on who is working or how busy the place is, but seriously - this is not a 1 star joint and some of the reviews have been too harsh. Locals line up quickly on weekend mornings, so get there before 9:30 or after 11 if you want breakfast reasonably quick.    Pricing is very fair for their breakfast combinations. Cooks may under-prepare some food when there are many orders, so I usually specify \"eggs crisp\" or \"extra hard\" to prevent getting runny eggs. I'd like a little more variety in side items, but I suppose I should be ordering from the lunch menu more.    There are a few outdoor picnic tables you can use if the weather is nice. And assuming the local hobos are not hanging out at them. :-)    It can be entertaining sometimes while waiting for your food, to listen to the employees conversations, and the drama of their lives, or friends lives. Yelpers should chill a bit. This is South Gastonia. If you want efficient, corporate service there are plenty of fast-food places around."}
