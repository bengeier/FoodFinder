{"text":"Had lunch today, our first visit to Forno 301.  We were delighted!  The food was fresh, hot and delicious.  The wood-fired thin crust pizza was one of the best, and also enjoyed the daily special gnocchi.  Outstanding!  The house red Italian wine was a perfect compliment to our meal.  Love the ambience and friendly atmosphere.  We look forward to a return visit to this hidden neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Love having such a consistently great place to go for late night food. Visited last night with some friends and we ended up closing the place. Even at that late hour, Roberto's hospitality was unfailingly gracious. Grazie!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying...the antiquated notion of \"Oh look at the funny Italian! So passionate! So devil-may-care and flirtatious!\" no longer works in a restaurant. I'm half Sicilian and even I myself acknowledge that. Especially in a small restaurant where the owner's actions are completely viewable to all customers, and in a time when there are tons of places to choose from.

I had been here twice previously and had pleasant enough experiences. In hindsight I think it was that I went earlier in the day. My third visit left much to be desired...namely, that I now desire another place altogether to dine at. We arrived for our reservation at 7pm on a Sunday night and were seated at a 4 top to the light sounds of Andrea Bocelli on the sound system. After waiting 15+ minutes just to get our drink and appetizer order in with the server, I noticed (by recognition of a couple of the folks seated) that there was a table of about 15 people adjacent to us populated by members of a small opera company here in town. And it was obvious they were there post-performance to dine and enjoy. But apparently - they were also there to give an unsolicited performance...whether the other patrons wanted one or not.

Without warning, Bocelli goes full blast over the speakers, and two of the opera singers start singing at full voice in this tiny, railroad style restaurant. It was the equivalent of screaming Motley Cr√ºe into a shoebox. This went on for about another 20 minutes - and I couldn't even hear my friends sitting 2 feet from me. I had been multi-tasking - keeping an eye on the owner (Roberto) because he seemed to be encouraging this, all the while giving very obvious attention only to other tables occupied by female ASU students less than half his age, strutting around behind the bar while barking orders at servers, and trying himself to sing along at this impromptu Bocellipalooza. He seemed more caught up in showing off and preening for the customers rather than actually serving them.

I managed to get his attention and upon his arrival to the table I asked \"how much longer is this going to go on? We can't hear ourselves talk and we weren't expecting a concert\". Here's what followed:
R: \"That's the opera - they're celebrating. It's their night.\"
ME: \"Oh? What about the other customers filling your restaurant? Is is their night, too? If it's just the opera's night, then close your restaurant for a private event so other customers can have quieter dinners elsewhere.\"
R: \"This is what we do here. Everybody knows. At night we turn up the music and sing and scream. EVERYBODY knows.\"
ME: \"I guess I didn't get the memo. Also - I've been here twice before and it wasn't like this. The music and singing is way too loud and customers can't enjoy themselves - including the four of us.\"
R: \"It's THEIR night.\"
ME: \"Actually, I think it's YOUR night...because all these people you see seated in your restaurant? They're putting money in YOUR pocket. And you're singling out one table.\"
R: \"Well I'll turn the music down but not off. This is what we do here.\"
ME: \"I didn't ask anyone to shut any music off. I just wanna be able to have regular, reasonable dinner conversation without blaring music or tenors screaming at the next table.\"

So needless to say, I won't be back. And apparently I'm not alone in my experience with this juvenile, arrogant owner who thinks he's some sort of Italian celebrity and whose proprietary focus is hitting on college girls and parading himself around like an ex-member of the Rat Pack rather than practicing good customer service and creating an atmosphere that everyone can enjoy."}
{"text":"Italians making Italian food. Wonderful personalities and even better pizza. We had the antipasto, spinach ravioli and two pizzas with the understanding that we'd take whatever was left home. There was nothing left, we didn't stop eating when we were full but when the food was gone. 

I really liked it, the wife likes it and the kid liked it. 

Good job fellas, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this cute little place, and I have to say I'm surprised by the other reviews. The pizza crust was ok, but they used a tomato sauce, that tasted like it was just spooned out of a can. The other ingredients were very sparse. The waitstaff was friendly, and very nice, and Italian. Its just not that hard to make a good pizza"}
{"text":"Loved this place very authentic Italian pizzeria can't wait to take my boyfriend here!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place purely by accident.  And boy am I glad I did!  The staff were amazingly friendly in the Italian family style.  Jovial, smiley, truly interested in what I had to say.  The barmaids were both on top of my drinks all night, making sure I was never thirsty. Admittedly I made it easy on them, staying with Peroni, I figured \"when in Rome\"!

The bruschetta was a portent of the amazing flavors I would experience that evening, all fresh components, all extremely flavorful.  

The pizza?  Simply AMAZING!  Places like Forno 301 really make me marvel at the skills a talented chef possesses.  The pizza ingredients were selected to complement one another.  The texture, flavor and consistency of the dough works harmoniously with the amazingly flavorful sauce and the perfectly textured/consistent/flavored cheese to create a whole much greater than its individual parts.  Whether the topping was \"diavlo\" (pepperoni), basil, or simply 4 cheeses, the pizza delivered time and time again.  Typing this review makes me want to go back tonight!

Buona Fortuna Forno 301!  I hope you all are extremely successful in your venture!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished up with this one. Disclaimer: I'm just on a quick trip to Phoenix so I don't know the standard and I'm coming from Chicago, so any pizza is bound to taste royal. But, I have lived in Italy for multiple years and can say confidently that this is real Italian pizza and these guys put on an excellent informal turn romantic experience. Quattro Stagioni was delicious, but they all looked excellent and I can't wait to try the Margherita. Pro tip: brush up on a few Italian phrases before you walk in. Roberto on the floor and Luca on the stove will help make you look like Rico Suave in front of your date. I rolled in solo, so was more on the \"How's Your Girl.\" Bravo."}
{"text":"Fantastic as usual.   Roberto and his crew do a fantastic job and make fantastic food.  Relaxed and fun with great food....  what else is there?"}
{"text":"Fantastic wood burned pizza and salads makes these place an awesome dinner or lunch spot. But what sets Forno 301 apart is Roberto the owner. Not only is he hilarious, cracking jokes with us everytime we come in, but extremely generous. He made an extra pizza for my friends picky eater son one time or giving free tiramisu with our dinner. 
I highly recommend supporting this small spot"}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant came highly recommended by a couple of friends. I ordered the pasta of the day and my lunch companion ordered the ravioli. Both pasta dishes were delicious. The portions were average in size (not the obscenely large portions that most places serve); sufficient for lunch. For dessert we shared a panna cotta which was delightfully creamy and light. The prices were very reasonable. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Real italiano! Love this place, owners are extremely friendly. Very clean and fancy inside. The food is very delicious as well."}
{"text":"First time here had their gnocchi with pesto sauce and focaccia de Rocco ( I think that's right it was a special).... Amazing:). Will he back for sure."}
{"text":"First time in and will be back soon. Skipped the menu and just said, \"bring me the house wine and every recommended dish.\" Had some friends with us and they loved it too! This place rocks and the owners know how to take care of their patrons. We own Rott n' Grapes and see a similar vibe. 

First time At the new location! Are you kidding me? By far the best Italian Restaurant in the Valley! Love these guys and their fabulous food. And closer to the house! Can't say enough about Forno 301. I would give them a 10* if possible!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious pizza, fresh salads, great service and overall a a wonderful place! The crust though.... Yum. One of the owners was our server. He was so much fun! We will definitely be back! 
Ps don't forget to try the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I genuinely love this place. The Italian bartender/server is a riot although his service can be on the slow side. It doesn't really matter though, because the dude is hilarious. Food is on point. Pizza is great, best downtown imo, and I'm a big fan of their pasta and salads as well. The only reason I didn't give five stars is their penchant for playing sexy time r&b music at obscene volumes at times. Sorry, but hearing a dude sing about laying his girl down on a bed of flowers and oil while describing licking her entire body doesn't exactly wet my appetite. For food, that is. Please pick a less obnoxious dining channel and I will be happy to upgrade to five stars"}
{"text":"Homemade pasta is great. Ordered the special, pear salad and meat pizza. 
Service was also great. Owner is very friendly and made great suggestions. Highly suggest this place if you have been to Italy and love authentic Italian food. 
Fantastico!"}
{"text":"Most amazing Italian food, like being on a trip to Italy. Wood fired pizza, handmade pasta. We had the prosciutto bruschetta, arugula salad with pecorino dressing, and meatball appetizer is TO DIE FOR. follow by eggplant Parmesan, ricotta stuffed ravioli with light butter sauce was the most amazing thing I've ever tasted and pesto gnocchi that melted in my mouth. Dessert was strawberry panna cotta that was straight out of Italy. Amazing authentic Italian staff so friendly and accommodating. A MUST!!!!! Best meal I've had in a long long time."}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food! The staff is great there, and the food is delicious. We had all kinds of small dishes there and every play was amazing."}
{"text":"So this was our third attempt at a restaurant on a Sunday night. (The other places were closed contrary to advertised hours) anyway I'm glad we came here! Late night hours is always a plus for me. The decor is simple yet chic. Reminds my partner of a New York restaurant. Wine bottles stored in the wall were a very unique but cute touch! The food was great! They seem to specialize in pizzas but also have pasta and pasta specials! We ordered the anchovies pizza, gnocchi, cannelloni, and another pizza. Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time and the taste did not disappoint! Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Italian meal!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Italy, or at least visited any length of time; you are certain to be transported to Sanremo when visiting this distinguished establishment. 

Roberto e Lucca are delightful, engaging, and warmly Italian!

The Pizza is pretty darn good too! 

They are Italian, not Chicago Italian, not New York Italian, but Italian from Sanremo. Known for its beautiful coast and Song Festival. 

Hugs and warm appreciation always!

If you like american soppy pizza...  This isn't for you"}
{"text":"First time at Forno last night and yet it felt like we were regulars.  A warm greeting at the door by the owner set the tone.  Basically the place is just fun.  Obviously lots of regulars and a welcoming vibe.  Pizza and salads were great and the wine was nice and very reasonably priced.  It is so great to see places like this in downtown Phoenix .  A waive and nod from the owner on the way out are all you need to know that this place will have staying power."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in town, fresh and authentic. Service can be a bit slow but it is worth the wait. Wonderfully quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian food I have ever had!!!! The wood fire meatballs are to die for I was even  tempted to lick the plate because the sauce was so good. I highly recommend this place. The lasagna was perfection."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and drinks all amazing. You don't feel like you're in Phoenix, and that's a compliment. This isn't some local, greasy pizza joint. I love other award winning places that have been featured on several cooking shows but this place takes the cake with fresh ingredients, great flavors and ambiance. This is a place I could eat at several times a week and I plan on it!"}
{"text":"Thank you Roberto and Luca for being so personable and giving soo much good service!! We love your place and your pizza. That is a real traditional italian pizza!! We love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Prosecco me.

Top notch service. I was happy to see the door opened and to hear laughs spilling out onto the Roosevelt sidewalk.  The glowing soft light at 11:30 p.m. in DOWNTOWN phoenix was inviting to say the least after just getting off a shift a work.  I secured my bike and proceeded to see what fun I was about to be encompassed in.  
The smell of pizza absolutely kissed each cheek twice as I lead myself to the bar. 

Greeted by the handsome Luca I was handed a menu while water immediately provided = immediate desert bonus points. 

The gals at the bar had been there for some time and looked fantastic. I was introduced within 2 minutes of ordering my flute of delicious bubbles, and away the night flew as the lot of us discussed travels afarr and told stories over each cheers. 

After two prosecco and plenty of cocktails tasting, I was ready to go.   Paid my tab and thanked these charming gentlemen for their hospitality and vowed to myself to order a whole pizza to myself upon my next visit. 


Next dinner date spot for sure. Although, It's tough to peel my eyes off the staff.  Yikes and meow. 

Vibe, menu, service, location and open times.  A+"}
{"text":"Always a good solid choice. One of our absolute downtown favorites. Don't go for a quick in an out dining experience, go for the traditional Italian way to dine -- meant to be enjoyed slowly with a glass of wine and good company. 

Gnocchi is a must order."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Forno 301 last Friday night.  Everything we tried was delicious and there's more on the menu I need to get next time.  We shared the burrata and tomato bruschetta, the pizza with prosciutto and olives, and a tiramisu.  We also got a carafe of red wine and cappuccinos.  Its all tasty and very afforadable.

I also thought the service was really good.  Unlike a lot of other restaurants, it was not too pushy.  I never felt rushed and so I could really relax during the three courses. 

I look forward to going again."}
{"text":"It's a darn shame - this place. Great atmosphere, the food was excellent - but the service was an all time nightmare.

We went later in the evening on a weekend night. They barely acknowledged us when we sat down, then they proceed to forget our salad. Followed by forgetting our pizza. Followed by forgetting our pasta. Followed by forgetting out check. Followed by forgetting to pick up our check.

I couldn't believe it. Our waiter must have walked by us a dozen times throughout the night and never quite got it. 

Food was so good - too bad we'll never go back to enjoy it again. 

Get it together Forno 301, your food is too good to give service this bad."}
{"text":"Just finished every last bite of our pizzas and it was absolutely delicious! We ordered take out and it was right on time. There are a lot of pizza options in the neighborhood and after tonight, I doubt we'll order from anywhere else. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Greatest fire roasted pizza, but the Bruchetta with fig jam and gorgonzola and arugula is the best of all.  The volcano chocolate cake with pear is simply heavenly.
Be sure to stop by and get a little big dose of Italy in this lovely quaint neighborhood restaurant.   Service is extraordinary!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful wood fire pizza restaurant. Ambiance is lovely! Can't wait to come back for more pizza and salad."}
{"text":"I stop by here with friends . This place is amazing. The staff superfriendly and the food phenomenal. Sure we comeback"}
{"text":"I live in the apartment complex that's attached to this amazing p?ace . So i enioy the wonderful pasta and pizza here at least twice a week! It's that good! The best Italian food in Phoenix and I've been here 10 years , I say go for the gnocchi for pasta and Margarita for the pizza! Love the owner Luka and Roberto is also fantastic . Great bar too! 11/10"}
{"text":"Amazing service very personable. Felt like I walked in for pizza but left with a new Italian grandpa."}
{"text":"What a wonderfully authentic, tasty, and affordable place! Superb flavor in the salads and pizzas, but don't expect the typical American twist because you won't find it (and for that I am grateful)! Great environment, friendly owners, oh and did I mention the food? If you want an authentic taste of Italy, I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Wish the service was a little better (one of the staff members wasn't so friendly) plus my waiter was a little slow to check me out (payment wise) or check on me during my meal to see if I needed anything (to go box, drink, how my meal tasted, etc). For this reason I didnt give five stars. I would for sure go back as the pizza was amazing! Plus it's literally down the street from my work so it's perfect :)"}
{"text":"Roberto and Forno make for a great experience. Simply ask him to bring his favorites and you will become a loyal regular! Did not know Italian food could melt in your mouth. Order anything you will not go wrong."}
{"text":"After a trip to Italy, we stopped by this neighborhood place and from the back door entrance to the lovely friendliness of the staff to the smells coming from the open kitchen, we were back in Lucca!  (Although Roberto is from the coast of Italy and probably wouldn't appreciate the reference.)  Since then we have had intimate dinners / glorious lunches / family events...all at Forno.  Love this place."}
{"text":"LOUD, but the food was delicious. It took awhile for the food to get to the table but when it did it wasn't wasted. We had 4 different types of pizza and a dish of pasta as well. It was unanimous 'Hood Food'! Service was the only ? as it took awhile to get 2nd drinks and because of the loudness, getting the right drink, but after the smoke cleared and all in all the group left smiling, full and happy. Consensus \"We'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it is simply incredible!  The staff, music, ambiance, location and mostly the food doesn't get much better than this.  Please don't change, Forno 301!  Fantastic addition to downtown... Grazie!"}
{"text":"We're in town on holiday and came here for our first dinner.  It was good. Our server, who we presumed was also the owner, was cool + casual with his heavy Italian accent and typical European curtness (with an occasional warm smile).  You could tell he loved what he was doing and the myriad people who come through his restaurant's doors.  The portions are not the standard American XL, which may or may not please fellow patrons, and everything tasted fresh.  The handmade gnocchi in pesto was quite a treat for one's tastebuds, and the eggplant parmesan was very good (served with crusty bread drizzled with olive oil) - though on the very small portion side.  A margarita pizza and \"0\" salad complete the order, both were happily enjoyed by their orderers.  We shared a creme br√ªl√©e and tiramisu, both were just ok. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and we left full and satisfied, but I wouldn't seek it out if in town again.  Great for families with kids."}
{"text":"LOVE THE PIZZA!!! Frankly, I'm a little shocked reading the bad reviews. I think the service issues are a cultural thing - anyone who's been to Europe knows that dining and eating are not rushed and lunch or dinner is a time to both socialize and eat. Earlier today I went in to watch the Barcelona @ Atletico Madrid game and the owner turned the TV toward me (seated at the bar) and I said \"I have a meeting at 1\" and I had my pizza and paid quickly. The guys there are so friendly and nice. 

The food snobs writing the bad reviews crack me up. Read their reviews, they're the types that are just looking for something to complain about. Enjoy the food, enjoy your friends, enjoy the restaurant. If you want speedier service then simply tell them that you have a limited time for lunch. Problem solved. 

The guy who ripped on the pizza and included a photo got the pizza to go. This isn't Papa Johns bro, you don't get this type of pizza to go. You eat there when the pizza comes fresh out of the oven. It's your fault for being stupid. I've been to Forno a dozen times and the pizza is phenomenal, one of the best in the valley. 

And the other menu items are also phenomenal. 

Like I said, if you're going in for lunch and pressed for time simply tell the waiter and you'll be fine. And eat your food there. It's not meant to be take out."}
{"text":"I will never return to this establishment again. I've never been treated so poorly while dining out in my life. The owner was extremely rude and embarrassed our entire table. He became upset when asked to split the drink tab. It was only a request considering we had reservations for a group of 14. Once asked to split the drink tab he began to yell at our table and grabbed his crotch. We were a group of 14 woman and that was extremely uncalled for. It was almost like he was on something. He was the most unprofessional person I've ever encountered while dining out. If he cannot handle customer service then he needs to stay behind the scenes. What kind of person grabs their crotch then serves food? Disgusting."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in AZ!! Please stop by and meet the incredible people behind Forno and try their beautiful dishes!!! Best pizza in AZ!! This is real traditional Italian food!!"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant!!  We went there with friends on a Tuesday night and it was packed!  It's so great to see the hustle and bustle of downtown.  We started with some Italian wine in little tumblers and then we shared some meatballs (not my favorite) and some good cauliflower for appetizers. I had the gnocchi with bolognese sauce which was delicious. One of our party had the pizza -- very good.  And the salads were delicious as well.  We had a great authentic Italian waitress.  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Roberto, enough said.  Hilarious and the perfect host.  Wonderful environment, in general, including a nice interior setup and a great patio.  Pizza is to die for, heavy on the tomato sauce - and that's a good thing!  Nothing not to like about this little gem..."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem near downtown.pizza is legit,guy is from Italy and their pizza and salad is amazing. Housewife is reasonable and good and their is nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Hospitality is the gift that this restaurant was given by the powers of the universe. Authentic Italian family atmosphere is how I would describe this.  I often leave thinking they think I'm a celebrity by the way I'm warmly treated!

The \"new\" location is like the trophy they won by succeeding in the previous real estate. The location and style is modern and perfectly placed in our Phoenix landscape. 

The pizza here is amazing - I'm stuck on diavola right now! Red sauce pizza with mozzarella and crazy good pepperoni. I'm someone who tries to avoid meat but count me in for this any day. Like 3 times a day. 

They have a solid house wine that's similar to a Chianti but Roberto says it's \"better\" like a table wine or everyday thing. See he gets me! The cocktails here are solid as well, don't worry.

Got to love the salads here served always with bread.  Housemade pasta is probably the real highlight of I wasn't such a pizza fan.  My bestie makes her own pasta and raves about Fornos.

Lastly the desserts- tiramisu I love you.  They serve it like a parfait which usually makes me feel like I'm at hometown buffet but once you dive in to the custard and ladyfingers all is forgiven.

ELITE TIP: The Italian charm is best experienced at the bar."}
{"text":"Owners are super funny and very nice. The food is always great, the wine top notch and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"I don't know how there are 4 and 5-Star reviews! I'm sorry but this was the worst restaurant (food and service) I've ever been to. Food (every dish we ordered) was soggy and service was non-existent. We had to wave him down every single time we needed something (water, food cuz it took FOREVER, the check, everything.) And the hostess kept seeing us wave for our server and didn't alert him. She just stood there staring at us! So bizarre!! We'll never go back. Oh and it's so loud."}
{"text":"Perfect texture and taste on the crust, salad was simple yet full of flavor.  Very apparent that they are using high quality ingredients. Very friendly staff. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very cool location and building downtown. The pizza is very good, but not great! I would still choose Federal Pizza or The Parlor if I wanted premium pizza, plus the bar choices here are definitely lacking....but I guess you don't really come here for cocktails because it is pretty much a pizza and wine kind of spot. I would definitely go back because it's a cool hip spot with good food and close to downtown."}
{"text":"Super delicious food, super great people! Every time I go I feel like family. I just love this place!!"}
{"text":"I like the food, the prices are decent for location and quality...  service is horrific.   Great spot for lunch if it isn't busy but stay away if it is a weekend night..      it's defiantly worth visiting and if they got someone their over worked servers some help
It would be a great weekend spot...


So overall, food is awesome, server was really nice and literally running, price was good... if they hired one more person it would be 5 stars..  will come again just not on a weekend"}
{"text":"ROBERTO, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE FUTURE OF FORNO, PLEASE STOP BEING A JACK ASS TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. Seriously, my first impression of Forno was all positive when they were on Roosevelt. Within 2 minutes I knew I would be back. That's how good the service was. Angel and Luca (the other owner along with Roberto) both greeted us, were prompt to make suggestions, and followed up on everything. Drinks were immediately ordered and served, along with the food. Ever since they moved to their new location on McDowell and Central the exact opposite has been true of the service. 

My girlfriend and I live in Willo, so we were delighted that they moved to our neighborhood. However, service has been non existent. I understand being busy. My girlfriend and I have both worked several years in the industry, but please acknowledge that we exist. On more than one occasion I have to wait several minutes before being asked what I want. Food, drinks, water, etc. When my order is finally taken, no one follows up. I like to drink alcohol, and my first drink tends to be finished rather quickly. No one ever asks if I would like another. The staff will see my empty glass, but no one seems to care about generating more profit, or at minimum, tips. On several occasions I have been forced to flag someone down. Then there's Roberto at the bar. 

Let me preface this with saying that from my very first experience my first impression of Roberto was that he was rather direct, sarcastic, and crude, however, when employed effectively, those traits can be rather endearing and entertaining. HOWEVER, when I am ignored, and I'm sitting in front of you with an empty glass for 20 minutes, and my food is finished, perhaps you shouldn't mock me and embarrass me in front of several other guests at the bar when I have to ask you to bring me another drink. \"Now, now, now, \" was his response. Uh, yeah, NOW! How about NOW 20 minutes ago when I actually needed a drink. I'm sitting right in front of you. You're the bartender. Bring me a drink already.  

Now given that in the New Times interview a few years back Roberto is quoted as saying \"I don't give a shit what Americans want (we do our restaurant and food our way),\" I can gather that this strategy of being your own man/ restaurant/ personality works has worked for you. However, it doesn't matter what country you're established in, mean, spiteful, obnoxious, rude, and flat out poor service doesn't make you unique. It makes you lose customers. 

I want you guys to succeed. You're in MY neighborhood, not the other way around. It is only from previous experiences that I'm rating Forno with 2/5 stars. I will be back because you're close, but please read this and improve your behavior and service. We wish you the best of luck."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!  Wonderful, crusty panini with smooth tasty fresh mozzarella. The pizza looks good, too.  The decor is very European and the severs charming.  A terrific addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Dark, nice bar, great food with authentic service. Wine in a small glass like Italy.  Can get a little noisy when crowded but still romantic. Wood fired pizza oven produces!"}
{"text":"Just drove all the way over here going out of our way to also pick up others, and this trap is closed for a private party.  No word on their website and no answering machine when I called earlier today.  Horrible."}
{"text":"I stopped-in on a hungry whim, after a foodless evening meeting next door. Roberto was instantly FUN to be around as I waited for my to-go order. The ambiance was low-key and calming. If you order the prosciutto pizza, make sure that you're ready to dive-in. Don't judge me, but I may have been a danger to others on the roadway... as I could not help but eat half of the pizza on the way home. I was astounded at the value and amount of ingredients on this $11 pizza. The crust (and everything) was delectable. In essence, the pizza is very sexy, and so is Roberto, Luca, and the rest of the Italian crew. I positively recommend trying this spot. Next time I go back I will be dining-in."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here because it was a convenient location.  The food was good but the noise level was so high i couldn't hear my friend across a small table. They refused to turn off the loud music which in a industrial space is even louder.
The owner even argued with me when i told him my experience. The menu looked good but i won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very cozy and comfortable with the Italian family feel I enjoyed in Italy. The pizza was tasty and large enough to split. I am looking forward to coming back and relaxing with a beer n pizza like Florence. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome local pizzeria! Best pizza I have had in a long time! And the tiramisu is NOT to be missed!!!! Definitely will be returning soon :))"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews, I popped into Forno on a Saturday night with a gal pal, and experienced my dreams of tasting its pizza come to a very slow end. 

The restaurant was buzzing with customers, but not packed to the gills, with at least three open tables and bar seats available. There's no signage about whether you need to seat yourself or wait for a server, so we loitered in the doorway for about 10 minutes. Ten very sad minutes, where we were passed by at least three servers without recognition. Eventually my friend approached the bartender, who told her we could seat ourselves. 

We sat down at a table outside, and a server immediately came by with glasses of water. A good sign, you might think, but all immediately went to status quo. We sat at our table for another 20 minutes where we went ignored by all the servers. 

So, we left. Good luck Forno, but good riddance."}
{"text":"Eh. We had the burrata bruschetta and it was just all right. The wine selection was extremely limited to one red and one white....although it was inexpensive...I would appreciated a higher quality wine even I had to pay more. We ultimately went to Pomo for our pizza."}
{"text":"Just driving down Central Ave and spotted this restaurant decided to try it out.  Husband ordered Panino Prosciutto Crudo and I ordered Calzone Spinach.  My calzone was authentic,  felt like I was in Italy, bread was outstanding. Husband loved his sandwich would order it again but we have to try other things on the menu as we watched them go by we wanted to try all of them.  We will be back.  Roberto waited on us, we just loved him."}
{"text":"this is one of the best pizza place in phoenix the owner is very polite and helpful food is great and have a excellent taste.."}
{"text":"I consistently go back and forth on whether I like this place or not. Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing but the 5 or 6 times I've been have always been filled with service issues. This last time our waiter completely disappeared. I wanted to order another round of drinks but since he never came back that wasn't going to happen apparently. Then the issue was our table had to wait 30 minutes just to get our check, even after asking another waitstaff member that we were wanting to cash out. Will I be back? Probably, but just be aware that you'll most likely encounter rude service."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but the service is pretty bad and the owner's behavior is APPALLING.
Our book club met there for dinner on a Wednesday night. At first the owner, who also waited on us, was very nice. We had six people and told him we would have four checks, which he said was no problem. We all enjoyed our food, but it was pretty hard to get service. We had to go to the bar to get water refills, and one member was just feet away from the man, saying \"excuse me\" and waving the hand, and he simply looked right past and ignored the customer.

But none of us will come back because of how the owner lost his frigging mind when we tried to pay. We waited a good 20 minutes to get the bills. What should have been four bills, was instead one, with everyone's meals all together. The owner was called over and reminded very nicely that we'd asked for separate bills. No one was upset or scolding him, we just pointed out that it was all on one bill and thought he'd just take it and correct it. Instead, he began screaming at us. I went to pick up the bill and he actually knocked my hand out of the way and grabbed it off the table. He was screaming repeatedly \"Give me your credit cards!\" One member, who hadn't seen the bill at all and didn't know what her total was, asked him to hand it to her. He repeatedly screamed at her, \"No! You don't need to see it!\" The whole restaurant had stopped talking and was turned around watching him. The woman hadn't raised her voice at all and everyone at the table was stunned by his uncivilized behavior. She asked him why he was refusing to let her see it and he yelled, \"You don't need to see it, just give me your credit card!\" Then he suddenly yelled, \"You do it! You do the division! You do it!\", threw the bill and board onto the table and stormed away, the animal. We happened to have a member who works in the penal system dealing with crazies everyday. He gathered up our credit cards, went to the bar and calmed the guy down enough for him to separate the bills so we could pay and get the hell out of there."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you're missing out. 

Hands down probably the best Italian restaurant we've been to in Phoenix to-date. Roberto is a hoot and took amazing care of us from the time we walked in the door to the time we left. 'We' were a group of 9, and we offered Roberto to set up our order with all of the best dishes they have. BEST DECISION EVER - ENDLESS SUPPLY OF FOOD! 

No but really the food was amazing, we had an array of appetizers, two pizzas and a pasta dish - all were extremely well done and better yet, the atmosphere of the restaurant along with the employees created a memorable dinner that will leave a long-lasting impression on all of the friends in my group. I can't wait to recommend this restaurant to all of my friends!! 

Again, if you haven't been to Forno, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and service!!  Eggplant parmigiana so good!!!  Meatballs great!  Tiramisu fabulous! Luca the owner so welcoming!   Thanks for great food and experience!   Will go back next time in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Been to it many times and it has always been great food. Pizza, appetizers and desserts. Great owners and staff. It's awesome to have local owners succeed because they are mindful of their products. Looking forward to going to new location."}
{"text":"We love Forno and the staff.  We have been there many times with guests and everyone loves the food, location, reasonable wine and staff.
Try Mili's meatballs if available, they are terrific.
All the pizza's and salads are really good and every pasta special we have tried was well worth it.  The Gnocchi with pesto sauce is hard to beat and always on the menu.
if you want real Italian food, not americanized, try Forno, you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"So good! I'm an Italian citizen (check my name) in Phoenix on business and can say that Forno 301 is super legit Italian food. I'm not talking about NYC or CHI town Italian, I'm talking fresh from the soil Italian. The host at my Air BNB told me to come here when I checked in and I was skeptical but I did two days into a four day trip. What a mistake! I should have been at Forno 301 each day. My wife and I ordered three pizzas and a buratta on our trip and wish we could have eaten more. This is exactly what you would get in a small town in Italy. Not sure how they did that since the air, soil and water are different in Italy but they managed to do it right. I'm actually considering of taking a quick trip from Austin, TX (where I currently live) to Phoenix just to eat here since we don't have anything close to this back home. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came here to celebrate my parents 32nd year anniversary and read some great reviews. As we came in the restaurant was empty and we tried grabbing a bigger table since we planned on ordering a lot of food to try out, they quickly and angrily instructed us to take a smaller table.... Next we had an awful experience with the server. He was in a huge rush when they had barely opened. He never once came to check on our food. Never asked us if we wanted another bottle or wine or beer. He took the plates without asking or talking to us. Pretty much said 2 words. The food was great but would never come back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A well deserved five stars. Sporcacciona pizza was very good. Lots of flavors, you taste the quality ingredients. Goat cheese salad was a hit. The new kid on the block is coming up fast, this place is great. Liked the funky music and vibe inside. Coming back again, I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"This place is blissfully delicious. Loved everything and the wine was perfect. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Owner is awesome.... pasta was fresh and amazing.. seafood from rocky point. Moved from NYC and the best pasta in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"An Italian trattoria gem in all of AZ!

I promise myself, for my own sanity, that I will be back here as frequently as I can. 

I absolutely love Italy's delicious offerings not least of which is a good glass of spritz and authentic margherita pizza. This is the place to be! Best to come here mid- to late afternoon where you can sit on the patio, enjoy the pleasant AZ weather and kick it with an antipasto/pizza/insalata, and a good glass of spritz! You know, lazing away the afternoon deliciously. You'll get lost in your own little world munching and sipping. When you have Forno's authentic food & drinks by your side, you really don't need another company. Salute!"}
{"text":"Back again after a bit of a hiatus because of personal reason
Continues to be a terrific, cozy, friendly place. Food is excellent including pizzas, eggplant appetizer and deserts. The owner waiter mister everything is as good as is the restaurant
A great find in old town Phoenix"}
{"text":"SO glad we stumbled on this wonderful spot. I loved the family-like atmosphere. I appreciated the opportunity to practice my (molto mal√©) Italiano and the FOOD - fantastico! Grazie mille for making me feel welcome.  A presto!"}
{"text":"Came here for a family birthday dinner. We ordered about 7-8 pizzas. When I told my group I was lactose intolerant, the waitress overheard and was making faces at me and seemed like she was irritated that I was born with this condition. I found her to be very rude. I ordered the roast beef instead and it wasn't what I was expecting. It was cold cuts drenched in olive oil. There was another huge party waiting for our table staring at us and talking about us right next to us! Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"DON'T MAKE A ORDER OR DON'T EAT HERE!!!!!!!!! ******** I make a order with the uber eats for 2 testosterone pizzas. The uber driver just bring me 1. He ask to call to restaurant. When I call...the manager starts to shout out on the phone in Italian, spelling the error is the driver...he just make the pizza. It's show the total unprepared guy management this place. I don't recommend to anyone to eat in this place or make a order with uber eats. Probably the uber refund me, but I never more put my money in this place.********"}
{"text":"It's really an impressive combination of modern furniture fixtures and equipment with 2 guys who were born in Italy delivering awesome food. 

I was extremely impressed and can't wait to come back. The new location makes all the difference in the world."}
{"text":"Came here on a double date with some friends for dinner. The service was lackluster at best...but basically non-existent. No one acknowledged us as we came in and we were left to fend for ourselves for a table. Once we found our own table, we didn't receive any service for almost 20 minutes. Then it took almost an hour to get our food. Extremely disappointing. As far as the food goes, we had the bruschetta which was ok but the pizza we ordered was just blah. Between the service and average food I would have rather spent my money down the street at Cibo. Better food. Better service. And much better atmosphere. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem ... Delicious food (pear salad is great), and Roberto is a gracious host ... My only concern is that it gets so popular we can't get a seat there."}
{"text":"I will confidently give this place a 5 star rating. I've been here 4 times and each time has been amazing. Great service and the owner is to die for! He is so sweet and you can tell he really knows what he's doing. The guy making the pizza is also really sweet. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a very similar experience of many of the people who have written poor reviews of this place.  The boorish owner was loud, rude, and condescending, and at one point more than once berated us \"you're American, I'm Italian\" while literally (and in a very unsightly fashion, especially for a restauranteur) foaming at the mouth. Furthermore, in the middle of the bar area, he expressed his disdain by lewdly simulating masturbation with the TV remote (he looks to be at least 60 years old). For the first time in my life, I left a restaurant without even ordering. The location is rather tacky in the bottom level of an apartment building (didn't exactly remind me of the places I ate at in Italy), and parking is inconvenient."}
{"text":"Wonderful, just wonderful!  The food is amazing, the owners are warm, funny and friendly. Feels so good to be there! . 5 stars!!!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The best food I've had in so long!  The owner is fantastic and I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Loved it, absolutely loved it. It was incredibly authentic and delicious Italian food for a very fair price with wonderful staff and service. I would definitely return here as soon as I had another chance."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  It's the TRIFECTA....Great Food Great Prices and Great Service.
What a fun night!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great, the wine was great... the service was very European (slow and customer-driven), and unfortunately their old home felt a lot more natural than the cold, corporate feel of the new location."}
{"text":"This authentic Italian spot is truly a gem for dining in downtown Phoenix. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. The pizza is delicious, but the stars of the show here are the homemade pasta and desserts. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. The wait staff was completely on point from seating us to delivering the check. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. The service was outstanding  and friendly.
The food was so delicious. Everything we ordered was perfect. Eggplant parm excellent. Gnocchi was perfect. Ravioli was excellent. Pizza supreme. 
Definitely coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Great place!! Loved the food, atmosphere and customer service was exceptional! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to eat in downtown Phoenix. The food is amazing. They have the best Italian style pizza you will find in the whole state. Also ask if they will make any pasta dishes that aren't on the menu... most of the time they will."}
{"text":"I actually live directly next to this place. I must also say I'm writing this review after the first day it has been open. 
Yes, I went on Monday, the day they opened up shop. 

For a while this little strip hasn't had much success with businesses. So for the people living in this area we were really excited to have a new restaurant/bar opening literally next to our apartments. 

I ended up walking over and having the Margherita Pizza. One of my neighbors met me for drinks a little after dinner....This is on par if not better then Federal Pizza's Margherita Pizza (which is my favorite, until now). 

Custom Brick Wood Oven!!!!!!

The owners are from Italy and speak Italian. VERY FRIENDLY. They have Tiramisu that is really fresh, they were nice enough to give me a slice on the house. 

Variety of Italian beers around $4-5, everything very affordable! Cocktails, Wine, Coffee & Soda. They also have Bruschetta and Panini's as well. 

Interior looks really great. I'm happy this is here and I wish them many years of success."}
{"text":"I loved this little place we order the home made pasta which was seriously the best I have ever had and the pizza was outstanding. next time I am in AZ will definitely going back."}
{"text":"I will go back--but I will never go back on a Friday night or other night that is super busy.  The food itself was terrific--I had gnocchi in pesto which was excellent.  We also had two salads for the table which were both had significant texture and flavor.  There were two pizzas for the table and I heard no complaints.

Here are my issues--This restaurant has been around for a long time and there was no excuse for the service.  It was uneven--people got served wrong things, you couldn't catch a waiter for things like water or red pepper.  The pace was completely off--we were never offered a dessert menu, no one ever checked to see how the meal was.  I get it it is a First Friday and they were busy, but if you are going to have a business at Central and McDowell then you should staff to your crowd.

Secondly--I admit, I am a pretend urbanite.  I like to be around the energy of a group of people having fun--but still want some space.  There are simply too many tables on the patio--every time someone got up--or a waiter went by --somebody bumped into the back of a chair.  Between that constant disruption and the pace and lack of service, it took away from the actual quality of the food.  

The whole purpose of good Italian food and wine (which it was) is to linger with good friends.  This is not the place to do that--at least on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good Italian in phoenix but this place impressed me... very cute inside and the owner is great. His gnocchi melts in your mouth!!"}
{"text":"If you aren't amazed by the pizza, then you have to try the gnocchi!

You can taste the freshness in every bite of Forno 301 entrees. There's a little slice of Italy from the people that work there to go along with their excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went yesterday to Forno 301 as we heard many rave reviews, well it did not dissapoint!  It was one of the best meals we have had in Arizona (living here 13 years).  The eggplant parm appetizer was amazing and the pasta dishes were so fresh and seasoned perfectly.  Forno will be our new go to bistro."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant! Whether alone, or with friends and family, you will always be greeted and served with a warm welcome and smile. Roberto and the Forno 301 family are amazing people. The food is superb and high quality--all for a very good price! Outdoor seating for dining or cocktails is a great way to soak up the hip, urban vibe in Phoenix's Central Arts District, located just north of downtown."}
{"text":"We ordered a few appetizers and these were all great: wood fired  meat balls were very good, bruschetta with fig spread and prosciutto was my favorite and the wood fired cauliflower were also very tasty. 
The margarita pizza was done well, not too hard, not too soft. Right amount of sauce and cheese. 
I was not expecting onions on the fettuccini, so was not a fan of that dish. 
Overall it was good eats"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot! When you walk in the decor is modern but not too cold. It was bustling on o Wednesday night with the energy of a local friendly neighborhood spot. I'm guessing it was the owner behind the bar who appeared to know half of the people at the bar, and was having a blast. The by the glass wines were tasty (and I'm not always a fan of Italian wines). We started with the Mista salad. It was a simple salad, but one of the BEST salads I have had in a long time! We then had a pizza and a pasta dish. Everything was delicious. Everything tasted very light and fresh. I also think the portions were very generously sized for the price/quality. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is not the pizza your looking for.
Atmosphere was very loud, I couldn't hear the person next to me on either side!
we ordered meatballs, 2 pizzas, and a salad.
First pizza (forno 301) was burnt and soggy at the same time some how...
Second Pizza (Diavolo) tasteless, no kick to it what so ever, I had to add red pepper flakes and pepper oil to make it worth-while at all.
The salad was reportably very good and refreshing.
The meatball starter was spicy and terrific.
Service was very fast.
If i wanted a good  fire roasted pizza I would go to sal's. Skip this place entirely, unless you want to be the guy that goes to a pizza place and orders salad."}
{"text":"I don't ever take the time to write Yelp reviews but figured I would offer up my experience to save others the trouble of a trip. My girlfriend and I love trying out local restaurants, so when we saw this place we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, the service was bad, and the experience as a whole was unpleasant.

We found ourselves dining in on a Saturday night, and surprisingly, we were the only people save for two bar flies watching television, oh, and the owner outside with one of the servers sitting on a couch drinking and lounging about. It was strange. We had two different servers throughout the night and neither were anything to celebrate; in fact, the guy who you could argue as our main server was slow and didn't seem all that interested in helping us, nor did he seem aware that we had ordered a dessert with the other server after we finished our main dish. I typically forgive this kind of stuff and don't even remember it but we were the ONLY people eating so I kind of found it irritating.

I'm seeing others describe the owner as a nice guy, and I'm sure he is, but I couldn't help but find his antics oft-putting, such as when he touched my girlfriend's face at one point, jokingly asking if her Sprite was wine. It would've been charming if it didn't come off as unnecessary and creepy. He remained outside almost our entire 45 minute dinner with a rotating cast of servers who would go in and out of the restaurant to enjoy whatever the hell it was that they were doing out there. I don't want to claim he was drunk because I don't know for sure, but it did appear as though there were some drinks flowing. 


The food was okay. I would've given this place a higher rating if not for the weird atmosphere, strange antics of the owner and workers, and oh yeah, the bad music selection (I enjoy R&B but they played the absolute cheesiest R&B the ENTIRE time). The creme br√ªl√©e was messy and unappealing to look at. There are better pizzas around town, like Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Grand Ave Pizza Company, Pizza People Pub and Pizza Heaven. I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I really think I could eat here daily and never get tired of it - but I'm on a budget, so instead I aim for only once a week. The food is incredible (try the ravioli!), the owners are delightful, and the service makes you feel like you're a VIP every time."}
{"text":"Having pizza here reminded me of being in Rome, Italy.
The vegetarian pizza had eggplant, mushrooms, and artichoke. The sauce was so tasty with a hint of sweetness. Roberto was a delight to converse with. The Tiramisu was wonderful, served in a jar! Very clever. The whole experience here was great.
And yes, being a Sunday they were open. The menu is limited which I think is a good idea, keeps all fresh. There are bike bars in front to park and lock your bicycle. 
The place itself is quaint, about ten tables. Restrooms are handicap accessible and very clean.  Hope that the restaurant survives because we need an excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"Fabulous locally owned neighborhood restaurant that is reminiscent of a simple little trattoria in Italy. The owners are from San Remo and Italian is often spoken. My favorites are their salads and homemade pastas. Yes, there pizza is good but there are many places to get good pizza. What brings us back time after time is their amazing homemade pasta, the relaxed atmosphere that has you feel like family and the authenticity of this place.  Tip: When you're ready to leave, just ask for the check. The service is more European here, they're not concerned about turning a table, they let you take your time. Don't wait for them to bring you your bill or you'll be waiting for a long time.:)"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here.  Pastas and pizza were delicious. Nice mellow vibe.  On friday and saturday they do get busy.  645pm last night and seating was getting very limited quickly.
Great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Like some of the reviews, I will start with a WOW! Talk about great pizza. The sauce was perfect and toppings were perfect. One of my friend ordered the gnocchi and he loved it. Very rich and perfectly made. And of course the best part, as soon as my group entered (6 of us), Roberto asked red or white...and that's all that was needed to get me hooked! Will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza made by Italians in Phoenix. Deliciously affordable.
We tried the Forno 301 pizza, which was heavenly and enough for the two of us to get full on. Would highly recommend a salad as well since they use fresh ingredients and house made dressings.
I'm looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of our new favorite places! The ambiance is intimate, but lively. Immediately when you walk through doors you are greeted with an amazing aroma of fresh ingredients. The beautiful Italian music is loud enough to enjoy and calm you from a long week, but subtle enough to engage in conversation. The bar and restaurant seating is accompanied by those of friendly neighborhood regulars as well as those, like us, eager to experience such an incredible place. The food and beverages are nothing short of fantastic. The Sporaccio pizza was a recommendation and did not disappoint. In fact, this is my new favorite pizza joint. For dessert, we indulged in the Tiramisu, another recommendation, and a delightful cappuccino. I highly recommend this establishment for dates and small parties. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant and really wish I could give this restaurant a review on its food but we were turned away and told we couldn't even wait.  We understood that we were going to a restaurant on a Friday night and anticipated a wait, but once we walked in the (owner???) said can I help you with a puzzled face.  I said we would like a table for two and he said no table tonight.  I said can we wait and he said no.  Then he proceeded to give us a speech about how busy they are on the weekend and they don't take walk-ins.  We left a
nd went to old faithful, Pomo, had fantastic food and were treated like family. I will never be able to review Forno301 because this lack of respect is a deal killer for me and I will not support  an institution that is too big for it's britches.  I strongly recommend Pomo, fantastic food and service!"}
{"text":"Pizza so good you'll want to have it daily! I went, I saw, I ate! Forno 301 is so delicious it reminds me of this old place I used to visit when I was in high school. They had a brick oven in the middle of the restaurant and it was always so hot to eat inside- but it was heaven! That is what I just found at Forno, just a slice or two of heaven! The bruschetta was really different but good flavor, we had the vegetarian pizza which made me dream I was in Italy. Can't wait to return for lunch sometime again!"}
{"text":"DELIZIOSO! First time we arrived on a Saturday, right when they opened at 5:00pm, by 6:30-7pm it was a full house. Get there early so you can talk to Roberto, he's to the point, genuine, has stories for days and is an absolute pleasure to talk to. The food, wine, atmosphere and service is worth the 40 min drive for us. Everyone was sweet and accommodating. Been once and already my favorite. Grazie Roberto!"}
{"text":"Six of us enjoyed a great evening. Excellent pizza, pasta and salads. The fettuccine carbonara with the best I've had! The service was attentive and nice! Our friends gave it a \"TEN\"."}
{"text":"what a great neighborhood place.  The food was fresh, delicious, beautifully presented and way beyond my expectations.  The owner, Roberto, has quite the personality and all the staff 
are just special.  I'll be there a lot and be bringing lots of friends."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with Forno. Your food is great, authentic, and reasonably priced. Although, after tonight I will never be back. My beautiful girlfriend and myself sat at the bar and were not acknowledged or waited on in the slightest. Non of my family will be coming here either. I will get working on my co-workers next. 

You made a choice to serve us or blow us off.. Bad choice Roberto. Not cool"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It has a small menu of pizzas, salads, appetizers and pasta specials. It's owned by Italians and is reminds me of restaurants I've visited in Italy. The restaurant is quaint with a nice patio. I've had the #3 salad that has arugula, parmesan, pears and a delicious lemon vinaigrette dressing, it's one of my favorite salads. Their pizzas are Neapolitan style and have fresh tomato sauce and are on par with all of the other top pizza places in the Valley. Their tiramisu is worth coming here alone, if you're a tiramisu fan this is the place for you! The best part is that it's very reasonably priced. Dinner for two with 2 glasses of wine is under $40, which is hard to find quality food for that cost nowadays."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for Mother's Day and she loved it. There wasn't a set menu or a long line this Sunday. The service was great and the food was amazing. Thank you for a wonderful Mother's Day experience!"}
{"text":"Very good to excellent wood fired pizza. Crust isn't quite as light and airy as I like in a Neapolitan pie, a little bit denser, but still very good. 

Pizza selection is solid and service was excellent. The Testosterone pizza with egg is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is EVERYTHING an authentic Italian restaurant should be! I have not had one single item that I didn't LOVE and I've eaten almost everything on the menu. My fathers side of the family is from Genoa, Italy and he had a dish here that was on special that he hadn't had since his mother was alive over 40 years ago. He said it tasted like his own mother had made it. He was blown away! The eggplant is def one of my favorite dishes and is a magical experience. The pastas are fresh and homemade and live up to every expectation and more. I'm from just outside of manhattan and my family owned an Italian restaurant there for over 40 years, I know good authentic Italian food, and this is FANTASTIC! Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality that you are getting and the service is always awesome! I can't recommend this establishment enough!!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place since it's located just across my condo! I was pleased to see the place buzzing on a Wednesday night. The atmosphere inside was nice and the waitress came to take an order promptly. Upon placing the order the waitress bought us  the wrong salad ( I never addressed this) , which turned to be really good. We also had meatballs for appetizer, which I thought were a bit salty for me. The pizza was good. Unfortunately our waitress never came to check on us. She would pass to take orders from neighboring tables and never would give eye contact. I found this to be strange. Overall I had a lovely evening. Not the best Italian I ever had but surely refreshing to see this place in the Arts District!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it in to Forno 301!! I came here with a group of 9 last night and to our surprise, we were seated in their awesome private room. It was the perfect space for a group of 8-12. The service was VERY prompt, food came out quickly (almost too quickly!) and we really enjoyed our experience. 

But of course, the food. I've heard from so many people that this is some of the most authentic Italian food that you'll find in the Valley. Well, they were right! We started with their cauliflower, meatballs, and bruschetta appetizers. All were amazing. The main event was definitely the meatballs! The crunchy bread dipped in the unique red sauce was so dang good.

I ordered the cucumber and tomato salad and it was the perfect simple salad with a balsamic vinaigrette, mixed greens, feta cheese, caramelized onions, and olives. If you're ordering for a dinner salad before your meal, you can definitely split it. It is pretty large! For my entree, I ordered their pizza that came with artichokes, olives, mushrooms and prosciutto but got it without the prosciutto. It was DIVINE! Definitely just like Italy. The crust was chewy, yet charred to perfection. My ONLY complaint was that the toppings were a little too heavy for the pizza and they slid off on a few pieces but hey, I just piled them back on and all was good in the world. 

Many of my friends ordered the homemade pastas and I think i'll have to give those a whirl next time. They looked amazing.

One thing to note when coming here with a group - they do not split checks and will not give individual checks. SO, be prepared for one person to foot the bill and the rest pay that person back with cash or Venmo! I will absolutely be back to this tasty, authentic Italian gem."}
{"text":"Beautiful & cozy place, great food! For sure coming back soon!
The best pizza and caprese salad I have eaten in a long time! Delicious."}
{"text":"linguine al pomodoro  numero uno !!! Belle persone e soprattutto sembra di essere in Italia!!!! Complimenti. Staff eccezionale !!!! Buon giorno del ringraziamento!!!"}
{"text":"We visited late night and were pleasantly surprised. Great, romantic ambiance. I loved the style, lighting fixtures, and decor. Reminded me of my visit to Italy. We could see the wood fire oven from our table and enjoyed that. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and even shook out hands when we left. We ordered the cucumber salad and a pizza. The food was excellent quality. Again, the pizza reminded me of my visit to Italy. Awesome crust and great Italian toppings.  I was eying the calzone ordered by the table next to us. It looked amazing as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Having lived in Italy for 2 years, I can honestly say that this is a very authentic Italian restaurant. The employees and owner are real Italians that know how to cook! Americans are so used to greasy, nasty pizza. This is the real deal, whether you like it or not, it's legit Italian. Come taste and enjoy a real Italian experience. Don't settle for less. I highly recommend this place! I'll be coming back for sure (this is my second time here in two consecutive days. Si mangia benissimo qui!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience today. I am sure the food is great but The attitude and service attitude was disrespectful. They asked us to  sit outside in the patio and after waiting for service for 20 minutes , I walked inside to see if I can have attention from the server/bartender. Very curtly he said \" that we don't provide service in the patio \". Alleluia!!!"}
{"text":"As the Downtown Phoenix restaurant scene continues to explode, there are great new spots to discover all the time.  I've been at it nonstop for 2 years and I still find new places to fall in love with.  It should also be said that there are a number of culinary voids that Downtown Phoenix has room to fill.  Pizza, however, is absolutely not one of them.  Between outstanding establishments such as Pomo, Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, and La Piazza PHX, there's an all-star pizzeria pretty much around every corner of Downtown.  So it was with some confusion (and even a little annoyance), when I found out another Pizzeria would be opening up in the neighborhood.  With so many options, I feel like someone will inevitably get pushed out.  And yet, many of them really do bring something fresh and unique to the neighborhood.  Bianco brings a rich tradition, Cibo brings an unmatched ambiance, Pomo takes authenticity to new heights, and La Piazza marries tradition with innovative new ideas.  So what could Forno 301 bring to the table?  The simplest answer is, well, simplicity.

Tucked on the far west end of a strip of businesses on the southwest corner of 3rd Ave and Roosevelt, Forno 301 would slip right through your vision if not for a street sign outside directing you to the door.  The interior, while slightly elegant, is relaxed and approachable.  As many Yelpers have pointed out, Roberto the owner is byfar the biggest personality in the room and greets you with that booming Italian accent the moment you walk in the door.  He and his staff are talking up a storm in Italian to keep the atmosphere light and relaxed, but friendly and attentive enough to make you feel important.  My brother and I came here for an early Friday night dinner just before 5pm.  The place wasn't busy at the time but got busier as the dinner hour wore on.  We sat at the bar, manned by none other than Roberto himself.

Roberto chatted with us a bit about our day and then proceeded to take our drink orders.  I got a glass of cabernet to start things off.  From there I checked out the food menu, which as others have pointed out is VERY simple.  A decent variety of pizzas, but beyond that the selection of other dishes is fairly limited.  Which I don't mind, as long as the ones they're serving meet my expectations.  I ordered the type of pizza that I pretty much measure every pizza joint by.  A simple margherita pizza.  A simple thin 12 inch neapolitan cheese pizza.  Topped with a little basil as you'd expect.  After taking a few bites, I knew I'd hit pay dirt with this place.  The crust was crunchy on the outside but still had that thin soft chewy interior and just the right charr.  The tomato sauce tasted like the fresh San Marzano tomato sauces I've had at Pomo.  And the mozzarella hit all the right notes (though I wish there was slightly more of it).  I'm not sure I'm ready to say its better than Pomo or Cibo, but it can more than hold its own.  For dessert, I ordered, well, the only thing on their dessert menu.  A tiramisu.  Instead of its own plate, it came in a bowl with a spoon.  No forks needed for this concoction as it eats easily with a spoon.  Its not as hearty as the tiramisu I've had at Pomo, but plenty rich and decadent.  A very nice cap to the meal.

Total cost for the glass of wine, margherita pizza, tiramisu, tax and tip came to about $27.  The margherita pizza was actually priced a little cheaper than the other famous Downtown Phoenix establishments, though the rest of their pizzas are priced pretty much like elsewhere.  But echoing what other Yelpers have said, the staff here at Forno 301 was incredible to be around.  Super friendly, happy go lucky folks that clearly enjoy socializing with their customers.  Even though I've gotten great service at most of the big Downtown Phoenix pizza establishments, Roberto and his staff take it to a whole nother level.  Between that and the elegant simplicity of the menu and the restaurant itself, its a great fit for the Roosevelt Row area.  I have no idea how or if Forno 301 or any of the other outstanding Downtown pizzerias will survive the saturation of pizzerias in the neighborhood.  Without question they all deserve to survive and thrive with what they all bring to the table.  As for Forno 301, you can come for the pizza, but you'll come back so Roberto can put a great big smile on your face."}
{"text":"Great pizza and related Italian dishes
 Wine prices are excellent - and it tastes good
This place is such a super value that I hate to put the word out."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe in this place - neat interior design.  If you speak Italian, you'll love the chance to practice with the staff (my buddy spent summers in Italy as a kid, so he stuck to Italian while we were there.  

So, why 3 stars?  Just not the best pizza around.  The crust was really thin, but had a slight \"Saltine\" after taste, and could've used a bit more blackening.  The tomatoes they use were really fantastic!  I got the \"301\" pizza.  This had sausage, onions, and mushrooms as toppings.  The crust was too thin to really eat by picking it up.  The sausage was really nice (so often, italian sausage tastes like fennel, and not much else - not so this sausage - it was very nice).  Not a big fan of white onions on pizza and the mushrooms were a kind of unusual yellow color - just visually unappealing.  Maybe these are Italian mushrooms, but I didn't care for their look or texture (maybe sliced thinner they would've been better?)  

I love wood fired pizza, so this isn't a 'It's not NY style/Chicago style' thing, it's really that I just didn't particularly care for the crust or toppings.

Looks like a really cool place to hang out, but too far afield from my usual haunts for me likely to give it another go."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and awesome atmosphere. The R and B jams set the mood and the delicious Italian food fills your belly. The staff is all very friendly and will take care of anything you need. Favorite go-to spot in the neighborhood. 
Recommendation: pasta of the day!!"}
{"text":"Going frequently to the nearby Pita Jungle a friend of mine living in the neighborhood was dying to try this place out after seeing it on our way there. 
She really enjoyed the pizza and I can't say the same. It reminded me of the pizza at Cibo (which atmosphere wise I loved but in terms of the pizza, I have not returned to), watery sauce, not much taste and quite frankly forgettable. I wanted to like the place but really won't be returning unless a friend wanted to try it out."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are friendly and fun to be around. The food is always really good. The menu is not huge and the wine list is small, which I think is smart for them to do. They create more of an experience than just going for a meal. They just opened their new location and are no longer on Roosevelt. You'll find them at  1616 N Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85004 in the MUSE Apartment complex. Their new place is larger inside with a much bigger outdoor patio. They work hard and I'd love to see them be successful at this new location."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe I haven't written a review for Forno 301 yet?!?!?! I've been dining here ever since they opened. This place is a gem! A culinary jewel! It has a modern/old world look/feel about it. Daily specials and a simple menu, wood fired pizza, full bar featuring top shelf liquor and bottle beer and it is soooo reasonably priced! A 10 inch margarita pizza is $11! The panini are unlike any other- this ain't a squashed sandwich! Robert (pronounced r? b√´r) is warm and old school northern Italian as is his partner (forgot his name) and the waitress is a Pastry Chef from Cuba. Take a friend(s) or better yet- take a date! You will impress! Forno 301 located at 3rd Street & Roosevelt is just plain sexy!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food! Great atmosphere. We love the Diavola pizza and any and all of their pasta dishes! Very busy on a Friday and Saturday night so come early or make reservations. The Gabrielle drink is wonderful! Must try."}
{"text":"Not joking...it was seriously amazing! We had lasagna, prosciutto pizza, tiramisu and panna cotta. You can enjoy every single ingredient in the lasagna. You just want to know how they cooked it! Prosciutto pizza was also amazing. The tomato sauce was so fresh and it wasn't too heavy at all! Desserts...so good that we wanted to lick the plates! Highly recommended. In add to, the service is quick and very friendly. :)"}
{"text":"It's the best. You need to check  out this wonderful  place.  Great  service  and  fantastic  food."}
{"text":"This is a real bummer because I had reasonable expectations for this place. Living less the. 30 feet away for 2 months I finally ordered the sporcacciano pizza which I had hoped would be 'loaded'. To me utter disappointment, there were only 4 pepperonies and maybe 3 pieces of prosciutto on the entire pizza. And for 15$ after tax, I just feel like I was ripped off. sure the pizza did taste pretty good but for the money, size, & quality, I just don't think that this will be a return spot for me. I hope that the pastas fare better but I don't plan on wasting more money on a mediocre portion. pros- pizza was done in 10 minutes! cons-watery sauce, SCARCE toppings. any recommendations people? prosciutto & fig is my favorite but hard to get right for some reason."}
{"text":"I absolutely would not recommend this restaurant. The service is terrible and the food is mediocre. We waited over 20 minutes before the waiter even acknowledged us. My drink order was not correct, and since I figured he would not be back in a timely manner, I got up to remind him  what I had requested. I next ordered what I thought was a salad which came with no lettuce. I asked the owner for a bowl of lettuce to accompany the dish. He started yelling at me and telling me no because that is how it is prepared, and it was my mistake not his. The waiter then came to the table to berate me for having gotten out of my seat earlier to request the missing ingredient from my drink. He approached me again to complain that I shorted him a penny which he had dropped on the floor when I paid my tab. I honestly can say I have never been to a restaurant that has had such egregious and rude customer service."}
{"text":"The staff was slow and rude. The pizza was good but there are too many good pizza restaurants in the valley to settle for horrible service."}
{"text":"absolutely so amazing best italian food i've had comparable to the food in florence. the gnocchi eggplant parm ravioli and meatball appetizer are all to die for"}
{"text":"A group of us heard that this was a great place. We stopped in last night and felt like we had been transported to Italy... Handsome waiters and chefs... Spectacular food! Warm, cozy hip vibe We will be back"}
{"text":"It is real Italian, served by Italians! So be prepared for amazing quality ingredients, but also European paced service. My husband and I loved it and are already talking about next time."}
{"text":"If you want genuine Italian food try this place. Fresh, homemade pasta. Superb!  I had the cannolini special and felt like I was back in Florence. 

Oh, and for those reviews that complained about the wait, this isn't Pizza Hut!  Great food takes time to be prepared! Next time try Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Really great!  Everything I've had on the menu is solid.  Also, very affordable.  The owner is great and tries to get everyone to speak italian which is pretty fun.  They feature different pasta specials as well as salad specials from day to day.  Hidden little gem."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was skeptical about another pizza place opening up in downtown Phoenix, but this place definitely is a great add to our neighborhood.  We enjoyed the rustic atmosphere, friendly staff and great pizza."}
{"text":"Always on the mission to taste all the amazing pizza I can on earth , or at least in the valley.. Forno 301 was the chosen spot for last Friday nights outing. Having just moved into the Muse building on Central, Forno is lively, trendy and fun! The patio was packed but comfortably so. We were sat, luckily, within 5 minutes of our arrival, BUT it appeared there was a wait shortly after that. The decor is brick, metal and lots of industrial, yet homey touches. The bar was also poppin. One of the two native Italian owners was serving at the bar and greeting everyone! We started with chianti and prosecco and a Cioppata Salad to share. This salad is simple and fresh: Fennel;Endive;Heart of Palm;Mixed Salad with tomato , Evoo and vinegar. We then decided to order two pizzas. Even when we are only two, we order two pizzas to sample different flavors and have leftovers. The offerings for their wood fired pizzas are either 'Rosse', with fresh tomato sauce or 'Bianche' , without tomato sauce or 'white'. There are calzones too! Like, my favorite thing ever! They also have four homemade pastas plus one pasta of the day that I would love to try someday..and starters here ..lots of mozzarella!   BUT, tonight we agreed it's cheat day and it's pizza and wine night! Our 'Rosse' pizza was the Sporcacciona. This pizza was so good. The crust is perfectly wood fired; very important to my pizza palate! Topped with fresh mozzarella, fresh tomato sauce, prosciutto cotto, bacon, sausage and salame. The Amici was our choice for our 'Bianche' pizza. Fresh mozzarella, crescenza, provolone and salami make this pizza a cheese delight. I tasted garlic in this too and it was perfect. The chile oil that is brought to the table goes well with dipping the pizza into. We had no room for dessert , but we did have room for more great chianti! Loved the little glasses it's served in and it reminded me of Italy! Our waiter could have been a little more on his game of attentiveness , as our drinks and water went dry several times , but it was truly very busy the entire time we were there. I really loved everything about Forno 301 from the atmosphere, to the feel and vibe ; the food and wine were above amazing; bathrooms were clean and I love that the pizza is native Italian as it gets!"}
{"text":"Pizza is crazy good and the crust is perfection. Great salads and a tiramisu that will redefine your dessert stance.  I could be a reviewer and shit."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere. The service is excellent as well. The staff is very friendly as well. My favorite so far is the sporcacciona pizza. It's all made fresh and the ingredients are high quality. The beer selection is a little small, but I appreciate that they have an IPA on the menu. I've been here three times this week and will likely be a lunch time regular."}
{"text":"Goodness, the atmosphere here is GREAT! The owner is super energetic, friendly, hospitable, the music is lively with a mix of genres. 
The food - is Fresh and you can definitely taste it. It's light and you don't feel guilty from it being so heavy or eating an entire pizza to yourself lol which can easily be done. My 3 year old Ate Up the Margherita pizza and she is a picky eater so we are even more delighted. We also ordered the 301 and it's also delicious. The crust is thin and not too thick I would prefer a Little more crispy but still satisfying the way it is. The sauce is light and the cheese wasn't too much and simply tasted fresh.
The tiramisu and creme br√ªl√©e - both single serving size but easily shareable. Not too sweet or heavy. 
I'm pretty sure we're making this our new weekly pizza place."}
{"text":"I first found this gem of a restaurant a couple weeks ago by searching for the best tiramisu in Phoenix. Forno came up as the top result so I decided to call ahead to ensure they had some as it was late on a Sunday evening. I spoke with Luca and he teased that I would have to order 10 tiramisu if I wanted them to go. I arrived and was quickly greeted. I ordered 2 tiramisu and Luca came out from the kitchen to introduce himself. We chatted as I admired the outstanding atmosphere and learned a little about their past location and their upcoming plans for expansion. Luca described how fresh their ingredients are and that all pasta is made in house. He asked me to come back for a meal to which I assured him I would. I got home and had one of the desserts and found it to be quite delicious and incredibly balanced both in flavors and proportion of ingredients. I called to thank Luca and to compliment them on the dessert. He was incredibly humble and insisted that I come and see him again. 

Fast forward to last night. I went in with my roommate to have dinner around 630 on a Monday night. There was a constant stream of patrons, not too many that made it cramped and uncomfortable, but in an inviting way that compliments the atmosphere. We were seated right away and had our drink orders taken almost immediately. The menu does not have a large number of dishes on it, but enough to provide variety and helps order more decisively because you aren't trying to choose from 100 things. We ordered the prosciutto bruschetta with fig jam as an appetizer. We were at a table that allowed us to see into the kitchen a bit, right where the meat slicer sits which allowed us to marvel at the beautiful slices that were shaved from the ham for our appetizer. I ordered the cavatelli special which was stuffed with cheese, topped in a cream sauce with a line of bolognese across the top that ran perpendicular to the shells. The house made pasta was so light and delicate that it virtually melted in my mouth as I savored the way the bolognese sauce added a slight acidic tang to the delicate cream sauce. My roommate had ordered the prosciutto pizza with basil and fresh mozzarella which came out with a beautiful char to the crust without being burnt. We decided to try a couple of the desserts and ordered the creme brulee which has a hint of lemon that lets you know its there without overpowering the flavor of the shell or custard, the caramel gelato and a tiramisu. All three were fantastic and i sent my compliments to the chef through our server.

Luca came out and thanked me for coming back and introduced himself to my roommate. He told us to come back to try the ravioli as they normally serve a cheese and spinach version but will occasionally do a shrimp stuffed ravioli and on special occasions a filet mignon ravioli. I asked when and he offered to take my number and let me know ahead of time so that I can plan to come in to try it. As i was preparing to have my lunch today I received a text from Luca thanking me for coming in and letting me know he will contact me when they plan on making the filet ravioli. 

This has been the best eating experience I have had in Arizona since I moved here in 2010. The casual atmosphere is spot on, it lends to the business professionals who come in after work downtown, couples, families and its patrons who may be in jeans and a t-shirt without making you feel like you are over or under dressed. The food is phenomenal and their genuine appreciation for their customers exceeds expectation. I plan on going back again this week, even if its to have a Peroni or glass of wine to end a long day at work."}
{"text":"The bruschetta with Gorgonzola cheese is a must!  It was amazing!  We also ordered the fettuccini which came with an over abundance of onions, which was disappointing. Otherwise, dinner was great."}
{"text":"A small authentic Italian restaurant.  I was just in recently in Italy and this place reminded me so much of real Italian food; I think I even heard Italian spoken inside.  I had the homemade pasta of the day and it was excellent.  The price ($11) and portion-size was very comparable to what you get in Italy.  I can't think of anywhere in Phoenix with this kind of authentic pasta.  Don't come here for a big meal, because the portion size will be smaller than what Americans are used to.  You will have to order extra items.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! This might be the best pizza in Arizona right now, it is absolutely delicious! 

My friend and I ordered a pepperoni pie one night and we have not had enough of it since! So we ordered it again!! The entire pizza - whether it be the dough, cheese, sauce or ANY of the toppings are just amazing! I have no other words to describe this place. I am truly so excited to dine in at Forno and meet the owner and also try other dishes. After being in Italy recently and a native from New York, I will argue Forno 301 is pure Italian cuisine and the best around. 

I will update this review soon with my favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"Really great good. Prices are very fair. Owner are very good people. They are Italians and sometimes
Sounds like they re being rude but they are just joking. I go there few times a week."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, although a bit tight. The owner is very friendly, but service is a bit slow. He had a wait staff, but it seemed he was doing all the work! We ordered the 301 pizza. Excellent crust and fresh tasting  sauce. The only downside was the paucity of ingredients. Seemed like no slice had all three ingredients, mushrooms, sausage, and onions, and many just cheese and sauce. We would have been just as well off ordering the Margharita pizza for $2 less. It was delicious however! No beers on tap, so we ordered a couple Alaskan IPAs in the bottle. I personally would like to see a few more craft beer selections be available as they have only 7 or 8 bottled beers to choose from. This is a nice neighborhood establishment with good pizza, and we will certainly be back for another visit."}
{"text":"I had absolutely no expectations going here because of the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure who to believe. But because a friend recommended this place and last night my dad was craving pizza and we live nearby, we decided to make the walk to try Forno. Now it could have gone either way. But thank goodness we had an amazing experience here. And I know this because my parents just came back from a trip to Italy and decided it was comparable to authentic Italian food so great job, Forno! We came on a Friday afternoon after work, my parents, husband and I. The owner (I have learned from reviews is Roberto), sat us within seconds then went right into suggesting what we should start with which I didn't mind at all. The mozzarella (something) burata (on the specials menu) with saut√©ed spinach and heirloom tomatoes was the perfect start. The pizza (we got the 301) was so good and  the sauce the most amazing flavor and acidity was perfect. The homemade gnocchi was by far my favorite, I could eat that dish all day. We ended with the panna cotta and I was surely pleased. The appetizer, pizza, gnocchi, and dessert was the perfect portion for the 4 of us (and we are big eaters). I hope our next experience is just as lovely as this one was."}
{"text":"This place was a great surprise!  We all were delighted with our food and the server had the nicest accent!"}
{"text":"The absolute best for authentic Italian! Everything from the house red wine to the homemade pasta, caprese and bruschetta starters, incredible pizza with a soft doughy center and slightly crunchy outside, and the panna cotta and Creme br√ªl√©e - it's all worth getting! It's a really quaint place, great date spot! The entire staff speaks Italian so you know it's authentic as soon as you walk in. Molto delizioso!"}
{"text":"Location = Great! 

Food = Awesome! (Burrata Bruschetta, Prosciutto  Bruschetta, and the Sporcacciona Pizza) 

Service = Terrible! 

While I can sit and slam the restaurant for the service (seeing how I've been in the restaurant industry for 15+ years) maybe just some suggestions to management: 

- No host is fine but make sure everyone says \"hello, welcome, and some sort of acknowledgement to patrons that are leaving works WONDERS! 

- Sections vs No Sections....either is fine but make sure servers know who is taking what table. (Had 2 different people ask us for drink orders and then again ask about appetizers) 

- Server himself.....either WAY in the weeds, inexperience server or doesn't know how to manage multiple tables and orders as once. Server should write down orders to ensure correct order. 

- 30 second or less to greet a table.....don't believe me, have someone sit at a table for 30 seconds and time them....it's more uncomfortable then you may seem. 

- 2 minute / 2 bite rule. Server never came back to our table after food was delivered, had to flag down the busser to get another round of drinks, a box, and the check. 

- Bartender.....was there one? It seemed like every server was on their own; making their own drinks takes time away from customers. 

Like I said, I know busy and I know being in the weeds and this restaurant was not in these situations at this point. 

When it comes down to it, there are a NUMBER of places to eat now a days and what brings the customers back is impeccable service which this place lacks. 

I know Yelp seems to be a place to \"complain\" but I feel this review should actually help the restaurant succeed. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, definitely has that authentic feel to it. The service was a tad slow but the staff was very welcoming."}
{"text":"Pizza here is to die for! Everyone says the pastas are amazing as well, but I personally have not tried those yet! It's true Italian food that you're going to get seeing as the owners are born and raised Italians. It's a nice little hideaway place to go when you want a relaxing, cozy place to go. I love supporting our local restaurants and shops and this is definitely one of my favorites. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Homemade Pasta and AMAZING Pizzas (Try the Testosterone with Sunny-Side up Eggs on top) - BEST Eggplant Parm - and these OMG SERIOUSLY FAB Raviolis in Browned-Butter Sauce.. Oh, AND they have Amaro at the bar (one of my favorite drinks) - All served up by the FRIENDLIEST peeps downtown. I swear I'll never tire of filling up at Forno 301."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Reminds me of the north region of Italy! With true Italians working and making great pizza and pasta you truly are in for a great experience. Ciao."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and it is amazing! The menu is simple and everything is very good. They also do specials daily and change it up. I love that they are open late and that the kitchen stays open. 

The owners are so genuine and friendly, they offer great service and it feels like you are in Italy when you are here.

The pizza definitely competes with all other local pizza restaurants in Phoenix. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never have I loved Italian food more. Not only is the food excellent, but every time I come here I am treated like family. I have noticed it's not just me, but also every guest who arrives. The owners and servers AND cooks are so great at customer service and making you feel special. And it super helps that their food is outstanding. 10/10 I've recommended to everyone I know, and I'll continue to do so. Love it."}
{"text":"So apparently Forno 301 has been around for a while but they recently moved to a location that is very convenient to my office and now, I'm a fan! They take reservations which is good when it gets busy in Phoenix. The vibe is modern and very nice and the service is exemplary. I've eaten  in and taken out and been greeted with the same warm smiles and graciousness in both cases. I can tell they appreciate my business. Fresh fresh fresh food. I love the salads but everyone of the pastas is handmade also. Top quality ingredients and just a lovely experience.

Also: they are open to me ordering beverages without a straw. I'm trying to support the last straw campaign and really appreciate their willingness to work with me. Restaurants need to ask first."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today before a show at Phoenix Theatre. It was our first time. We started with the prosciutto bruschetta. Then we split a pizza and one of the pasta specials of the day (lasagna). And finished sharing a tiramisu. The lasagna was one of the best lasagnas I have ever had in my life! The service was fast! And the crew was amazing! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood type Italian place with a limited pasta menu.  The wood fired pizzas are the main event and well executed with perfect crusts and quality ingredients.  Meatball appetizer is good, but a bit lackluster.  The house hade pasta is quality.  Cocktails were poured generously and service was pretty good.  This place seems like it probably gets loud on weekends as it was borderline noisy on a Sunday night with football on at the bar and alcohol induced spirited conversations.  Tiramisu and espresso were perfect.  Ciao"}
{"text":"Here is the kind of place that can appeal to anyone. Forno 301 is located near one of the most urban and interesting intersections in all of Phoenix. Therefore, it will appeal to Millenials, or others who like that big city feel. Also nearby are several art and theater related attractions. Forno 301 is on the ground floor of the Muse development and right off the light rail. But most importantly, who doesn't love artisan pizza?!

On our way to one of the nearby theater offerings, my best friend and I decided to meet early for dinner. Even at the bustling intersection of McDowell and Central, sitting on the patio was comfortable. From what I could tell when we left, conversation outside was actually easier as the dining room was packed!

Our server was wonderful! She was helpful, gave suggestions, was patient and timed everything perfectly. (I'm embarrassed that I can't recall her name.) I'll have to visit again so she can receive proper acknowledgement.

Forno 301 was new to both me and my friend, but I'd heard of it recently. Regardless of their reputation for their wonderful pizzas, what I like best is how they combine a modern and relaxing atmosphere with class and quality. Seriously, the prices are very reasonable for the excellent menu and how everything is presented.

We had enough time to relax and enjoy everything from drinks to appetizers, entrees and desserts. Everything is delicious and enticing enough to make me want to return. There is more to the menu than just pizza. Check out the photos.

Forno 301 is a very nice addition to the downtown area. Plus their menu is diverse enough to appeal to lots of tastes, but seriously, who doesn't love Italian food? Throw in some great service with a unique location and you've got a restaurant I will happily introduce others to. Gratzi!"}
{"text":"I had the sausage and mushroom panini and it is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  Bread is fresh out of their own oven.  Everyone is very nice there.  I got to practice a little Italian with the owner."}
{"text":"The tomato sauce is THE. BEST. EVER. I had the Vegetariana pizza, and I don't like eggplant but wanted to go along with what my dad wanted. Holey buckets even the eggplant was good. I would eat that pizza again.

For dessert we had Panna Cotta, I've never had that before. It was fantastic!!! It was like cheesecake, but a little softer and without the crust. I look forward to coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastico as always!!!! Great prices, great ambiance, superb food. Fabulous service"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't terribly busy but there were some patrons inside and at the time no one was sitting on the patio.  We chose to sit inside since all of the windows at the bar were open so it provides a nice airy vibe.  When we were seated, the waitress asked me what I wanted to drink and never asked the person I was with if they wanted something to drink.  Never asked the ENTIRE time we were seated and ordered.  He had water which she provided to both of us plus my drink.  We shared a Pizze Forno, Insalata, and dessert. Although the food was delicious our service was horrible.  There were other waiters and I could tell they were extremely personable and attentive but our waitress was the complete opposite.  

I was hoping to return to try some homemade pasta but unsure if it will be worth returning.  I wish I would have had the same experience as some of the other reviewers.  This is not a knock on their food.  In addition, there was no parking in the lot next to them and the spaces outside.  So we had to walk a block to get here but I didn't care, I really wanted to try this place, only to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic. It's a brand new little restaurant downtown and the perfect lunch spot if you work/live in the area. I ordered the Margherita pizza which was cooked to perfection. The basil was fresh and the sauce was sweet and perfect, holy moley. We also enjoyed some wine and obviously had to have some tiramisu and now I've been craving tiramisu basically every day since.

Everything about this place is fantastic. The pizza was a great size (I had plenty to take home and enjoy later). You can choose between their red and white wine, and we tried both and they were excellent. Tirimasu was to die for. And the owner/employees (who are all Italian) were all so friendly and made it a point to greet everyone who walked through the door. They've created a wonderful little Italian atmosphere in downtown Phoenix and I can't wait to go back. I want to try one of their delicious-looking paninis if I can stop myself from ordering a pizza first!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and we were pleas entry surprised for a little late night grub down. Everyone here is very Italian which is seemingly great. The food options were on point. They have a wood fire oven in he back that is clearly manned by someone that has done this before. The wine list was slightly limited but sufficient and he ambiance was energetic without being rambunctious. Not sure if it's in my top places to get to but I'd def recommend it to a friend looking for some good grub late night."}
{"text":"Hand made pasta enough said. Eaten here twice both times where great experiences. We went to Italy this last year and this place reminds me of the food we had there. Going to be our new favorite place to take people."}
{"text":"One of my favorites.......excellent food, good service and reasonable prices!!  Easy parking in the rear and on the side and I believe this is all family run."}
{"text":"The appetizers we had( meatballs, bruschetta) were great. We ordered 3 pizzas , which were all fantastic. The only thing keeping them from 5 stars was the lack of service.  We were seated quickly but after we ordered our drinks, we had to flag down our server, which I don't believe in .  Otherwise, all was great !"}
{"text":"The gnocchi and ravioli was to die for!  Creamy, mouth watering and incredible. Great place to eat, relax and enjoy some amazing food options."}
{"text":"So yeah.... my fellow Yelpers got this one wrong. 

Hubby and I are in town for a weekend trip and decided on Italian. We walked up to the restaurant and it smelled like smoke- as in fire- but nobody was running so we assumed that this is the norm?.... we should have left but we are gluttons for punishment.... 

We were seated at a table inside, with no offer or option to sit outside, even though there were people eating outside. The space felt a bit tight, but ok. 

We ordered the meatball app and the testosterone pizza- both of which seem popular with Yelpers. Unfortunately, both were SUPER mediocre. This was the most average and bland tasting pizza that I've had in my life! The crust was not crispy, like typical wood fired pizzas, and it just was blah. It was also warm- as if it had been sitting around for a while to be brought to the table. The meatballs were good, but nothing to brag about IMO.

The waitress was nice, but she was pretty non- existent. Nobody brought or offered any type of table top items with our food such as Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, oil... nothing. 

 Lastly, the smoke situation was unacceptable. Midway through our meal our eyes started watering due to the amount of smoke that was in the air, and we heard other tables complaining and noticed other people wiping their eyes with napkins..... I don't know if this is normal for this restaurant, but it shouldn't be by any means. My eyes were watering even after we left and our clothes smelled horrible. 

Im sure you can find way better wood fired pizza somewhere else...."}
{"text":"This place is so great! It's intimate and really has that charm of being in Italy! The staff are hilarious and friendly. The food is to die for! It can get very busy, but they'll do what they can to find you a seat and make you feel well looked after."}
{"text":"Great late night pizza spot! Classy but cozy atmosphere, but the most important part....the staff!! The owner makes you feel like family, often times pulling up a chair and having a conversation with you! Like true Italian style :) keep up the good work guys! Pizza served until midnight!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another true Italian restaurant find! How did I get so lucky to come across this place? Oh yeah, fellow foodie, Britt C., introduced me!! Now I know why it's one of her favs!

On route to a concert at The Van Buren nearby, we decided to stop in and grab dinner. The place was crowded with people. They were happy ones, drinking wine and filling the room with laughter. At first, the staff told me it would be a super long wait, but luckily some customers left and we were able
to grab some seats at the end of a bar, but eventually once a table opened up, they offered it so we could have more room.

Britt and I shared the Sporcacciona. It's basically a meat centered pizza. It has prosciutto (my love), bacon, sausage, and salami (one of her favs). That sauce is soooo- good. Even though we're running close to the start of our concert, we scarfed the pizza down to not let its amazingness go to waste.

We also shared the pasta of the day. I didn't understand what they said it was since it was loud and in Italian, but it was the flatter type of pasta with a cream sauce (ridiculously good) and thick cuts of rich bacon. It's safe to say that we devoured that as well even though we were beyond full. 

The small little restaurant ran on the warm side since that large pizza oven was so hot and our table was one of the ones closest to it but it was well worth it to be able to taste this Italian greatness and at such reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Our meal was perfect! Everything from the AMAZING baked cauliflour to the gnocci and pizza was compeltely on point. This is my new favorite Italian restruant in Arizona, probably the entire South West."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this delicious and authentically Italian spot. Woodfire pizza, homemade ingredients and a hip and friendly atmosphere. Their wine is made with real grapes from Italy and is smooth, bold and so good. Try any pizza, the homemade ravioli or any of their desserts; you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"What can I say: sometimes you want to be where everybody knows your name.....la-la-la (music from Cheers....).
Fabulous place, bubbling life, outstanding food, great Grappa, great owners: Roberto and Luca found the right formula believe me!

Food is to die for and coming from an italian (from Italy) you can rest assured that it is the pure truth.

Thanks guys for having invented something that didn't exist before."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, DELICIOUS FOOD, and excellent service! This is a great little place directly across the street from the Phoenix Art Museum. We ordered the eggplant parmesan appetizer (YUM), a spinach calzone and a rossee pizza (Sporcacciona). Everything was cooked to perfection in the wood-fired oven. To finish off the meal, we tried the dessert and it was delish. Forno 301 is a trendy little place but not pretentious. All of the food had an authentic Italian flavor. The bar (which we did not sit at) is small and intimate with a large open window that faces the patio. This has overtaken Pomo as our favorite Neopolitan pizza place. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Food here is great, service is great. The decor is a bit off I thought, and you never really know who your server is, but minor details that are not entirely important. It also does get a little loud in the restaurant as it is very open, and small. Great food, fast service, convenient location and you can tell it is truly authentic. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Pizza is as good as any I enjoyed in Italy... And right here in Phoenix! Roberto and Lucca are incredibly hospitable! Cannot wait to go back... Bravo!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian place.  It was great getting to practice my Italian skills with the owner.  I had the Margherita Pizza, and overall it was good, great tomatoes and fresh basil. I wouldn't call the crust authentic Napolitana, perhaps the oven wasn't hot enough, or the flour is a bit different, it just didn't have that Naples Caputo 00 flour taste ~ reminded me more of pizza from Florence or Rome. 

Being a pizza professional I am super critical of pizza places, so I'm giving a solid 4 stars. Stoke the oven up a little more to get some leopard spots on the bottom of the pie for that 5th star."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner at Forno. Hubby and I shared the arugula pear salad, spinach ravioli, a diavola pizza and tiramisu. Each had a fresh taste and was nicely presented.

Our tab with two soft drinks and tip was $51.00."}
{"text":"So extremely glad that I randomly decided to check out Forno 301 today! After craving pizza for what seemed like ages, I finally had some time in my schedule to drive out and try this place. I read other reviews about parking and made sure to park in the retail parking garage attached to Muse Apartments so my drive/parking both went pretty smoothly. 

Upon arrival, the restaurant was busy, but not overwhelmingly crowded. We were seated right away and greeted by our server who brought us over some water. My friend and I knew what we wanted right away and were able to put in an order within a few minutes. We had the margherita pizza (never spurn a classic) and the gnocchi in creamy pesto. I had recently just had subpar food at a similar pizzeria/pasta place and was really hoping that Forno would turn things around for me and WOW, it definitely did. The pizza had a great crust and the tomato sauce on it was very bright and tangy. The gnocchi was complete heaven and was super fluffy and delicious. I really enjoyed how smooth the pesto was as well.

I did order a cocktail called the Gabriele which had limoncello, vodka, splash strawberry fresh juice, and proseco. It was super delicious (but a bit strong so be warned!) Now, we weren't exactly planning on getting dessert, but I couldn't resist! We went with the panna cotta which came topped with a strawberry jam on top. It was smooth and well balanced without being too sweet and really rounded out our dinner well!

Service was good overall, but did slow down a bit towards the end. They did give us dessert on the house as a \"sorry for the inconvenience\" type gesture which I really appreciated.

The quirky and intimate atmosphere of the restaurant and the great food will definitely have me going back here again."}
{"text":"Me and boyfriend Michael went to have dinner at forno and we were more than satisfied with the food and the service. Michael is an Italian native and his dad lives in a Naples so he always has big expectations on pizza. We have tried Bianco pizzeria since we heard lots of people raving about being the best pizza in Phoenix. Well that was an unpleasant experience and a restaurant that didn't live up to expectations. But Forno was delightful ! I had the daily pasta dish which was just the right portion and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Michael had a margarita pizza and he gave it two thumps up and said \"this is the real deal.\" Roberto the owner was so welcoming and made us feel like we were home. The whole staff was just so friendly. The atmosphere of the place is very relax and intimate ; which we love. They do have a bar. We thank Roberto for such a good first impression and we are definitely having many dinners to come at Forno."}
{"text":"This place was delicious, warm and very inviting. I came in with my family (5 adults, 1 toddler) was greeted promptly and sat quickly. (Very surprising since it was a Saturday night) Food came out pretty quickly after we ordered and was perfecto! The best part of the night was the special pasta dish they brought out for my daughter right when we sat down. Made everyone super comfortable from the start."}
{"text":"Great Neapolitan pizza.  I had the 4 formaggio Bianca pizza sans Gorgonzola add pepperoni and it was to die for.  BF had the Testosterone and the tomato  sauce was incredibly light and flavorful. Cream of Broccoli, bacon, pecorino cheese bruschetta was delightful. Tiramisu was also delicious.  Owner was very engaged and attentive.  We will definitely be back to try more pizza varieties. They have got something good here for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner here.  The homemade pasta was wonderful and so was the special pasta which was shrimp and clams - was linguine with white clam sauce and shrimp added but was one of the best I've had in town.  4 stars only because the server was a little standoffish and the bolegnese was good but not great.  Manager or owner came by several times though and she was very friendly.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm very fortunate that I get to travel all over this great country for work and eat at some of the finest restaurants on the corporate dollar. Have been to dozens of the \"best\" Italian restaurants in places like New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles I have a pretty good idea what great Italian food is. Additionally, I've toured Italy a handful of times  so I also know what authentic Italian is and should be. All that being said, I can honestly say that Forno is the best and most authentic Italian food I've had in the States. There are a few places that I've been that are more refined, but none of them are as good across the board as Forno. 

I've seen some reviews on here complaining about the service, and Roberto specifically. While I know that Roberto can come across as a bit crass at times in my opinion he's one of the reasons that the place is so magical. He's always treated me and my guests with passion and care. He's the real deal. Luca (the other owner) and Roberto just make the what it is supposed to be.......an authentic Italian restaurant with amazing food. 

When we go to Forno we always try some of the daily specials and eat our meals family style. The one thing we always, always get is the ravioli. I don't know if I've ever eaten anything better. Everything is made from scratch from the appetizers to the desserts to the drinks. It's my favorite restaurant not only in Phoenix but in the country."}
{"text":"After a week of straight bad luck, I finally ended my streak upon walking into this place. It's July in Arizona and everything is hot, including the inside of this restaurant (mainly due to the 900 degree oven that cooks perfect pizza pies). HOWEVER-I didn't care. And I'm the type of person that complains about the heat 24/7. It was so hot and the place was packed. Clearly no one cared about the heat because this place is heaven. The service, the food, the dessert, the energy, EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. I honestly felt like I was in Italy. The owner was just a dream, he was so hospitable, so funny, and so accommodating.

 I was there with a group of 5 other girls and we ordered the whole menu. We got the ravioli, diavola, calzone, arugula salad, gnocchi (OMG THIS WAS SO GOOD), 4 stagioni, and the pasta of the day that has changed my life when it comes to how a seafood pasta should taste. In the middle of stuffing my face I was already thinking of coming back and eating again. For dessert we got panna cotta and tiramisu. The chef even delivered all of our food to us. I love her. I love this place so much."}
{"text":"Hard to beat a tiny true Italian gem like this one. Even though the pasta items are few, they are solid."}
{"text":"We were supposed to go to Pomo Pizzeria which was one of our new favorite places... But they were packed... so we decided to try this place.... SO GLAD it turned out that way. The owner, Roberto was amazing. He's quite the character and entertainer. And the food is some of the best. They had an eggplant parmigiana special that was melted perfectly in a mild but tasty tomato sauce. The pizza is thin crust. And to my dismay we split a tiramisu... It was so good I wanted my own. Thank you Roberto for being so personable and having a great new neighborhood place to go to."}
{"text":"Amazing!!
This place is a small piece of heaven.
We had a party of 6 and was able to try a variety of their dishes.
The bruschette with the fig marmalade was to die for.
The eggplant, delicious.
Everything we had was seriously amazing.

The staff were not only friendly but also very attentive to our party.
Even the music was great."}
{"text":"Forno 301 has been an outstanding place to enjoy food & a lively evening. Sunday was our second time in and the service was absolutely fantastic. Roberto treated us like family the entire evening and gave us every reason to come back soon! We shared two bottles of their house made wine (great price, & delish), 301 Bruschetta, a caprese salad & an antipasto salad! We also enjoyed the vegetarian pizze, the house made ravioli & the pasta special cannelloni which were all impeccable! We even endured a few healthy shots of Montenegro as well as their tiramisu & espresso to finish the night. I'm excited to join them once more at their new location & will absolutely be visiting more frequently!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for more than just great food, this is the place!

The mood is always light and the staff is always very social, engaging, and friendly with the patrons. Keeps me coming back time and again. 

Roberto is an exceptional host with a killer sense of humor! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I spent nearly 5 weeks abroad, in Italy for two weeks solid. The social and culinary experiences had, left us wanting quite a bit upon return to the states. 

Forno 301 is without question the most authentic Italian dining experience AZ has to offer. The flamboyant laughter, the \"You don't like my food? Go fuck yourself!\" attitude embraced by Roberto, the owner, is as beautiful as it is a mirror to what we found in cities like Vicenza, Padua, Alessandria, and even Venice - although Venice is pretty touristy, thus, not nearly as authentic in spirit.  

Not only is 301's food exceptionally authentic - in terms of ingredients and presentation, it's fantastically delicious. The baked cauliflower, the pesto gnocchi, the 301 pizza, the fig bruschetta, the tiramisu, the texture of the lasagna alone is worth the trip alone. 

One thing we love, is the daily menu. Dishes that are only available on that day - which makes being a frequent masticator a new experience every single time. 

Let's put it this way - we've been going here for months, and have not told anyone but our closest friends. Why? Because we love this place so much - we don't want the stain of pretentious PHX \"foodies\" to stain the canvas of this beautiful place. 

If you love good food, a loud atmosphere, and mildly offensive conversation - go. If you're basic as fuck on the other hand, please stay away. 

Happy chomping."}
{"text":"You looking for Italian? Look no further. And just ask Roberto or Luca what's for dinner. You won't be disappointed ... just stuffed. Mangiare!"}
{"text":"Forno 301 is in walking distance from me so naturally I had to give it a try. What I'm about to say is probably sacrilegious but pasta/Italian food is not one of my vices so I wasn't expecting amazing things. We decided to start with the wood fired meatballs in spicy marinara. There was 4 large meatballs to an order and I think I could have eaten about 10 they were so good! For an entree we split the Forno 301 pizza {Fresh mozzarella | tomato sauce | sausage | mushrooms | onions} you can really tell the quality of the ingredients they use, everything tastes so yummy and fresh! I would highly recommend Forno 301 for anyone who wants some delicious Italian food!"}
{"text":"We went here for my brother in laws birthday. My sister managed to get a reservation for 10 of us outside. The service was ok, waiter would disappear for long periods of time, few times we had to go and find him. But that didn't take away from our food experience.  Pizzas were great, I enjoyed that over baked crust with fresh toppings. Their baked cauliflower was also delicious, and dipping the bread into the sauce was super yummy."}
{"text":"We've eaten there twice and it's awesome! Great service and so yummy! Their pizza sauce is tangy & Delish! Recommend the San Remo to drink!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This couple runs the restaurant and does a damn great job at it.  Food is great and the house wine is to die for. Come with a little patience and you'll have the best evening"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared two pizzas and wine here on my birthday. The staff is extremely friendly!!!  We felt very welcome from everyone. The pizza was amazing!  I could not have asked for it to be any better. Everything about it was fresh and cooked perfectly!  We'll be back again very soon."}
{"text":"The food is great, staff friendly and great location. Unfortunately the acoustics are bad and seated inside one cannot hear themselves think or carry on a conversation without screaming.  Sadly I was hoping to make it my go-to place weekly. I'll come back only when I can sit outside."}
{"text":"Refused to seat us and refused to let us order take out more than 40 minutes before their listed closing time.  They truly didn't care. Restaurant was empty so they decided to shut down early. We drove more than 20 minutes to try the pizza that looks great in pictures... went to POMO instead where they were happy to take our business."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, staff service not too great. Our waiter took 10 minutes to greet us. We received our meal in no time, and we weren't checked on after. We had to flag down our server for the check. Although, would return for the excellent food."}
{"text":"This place is always pretty busy and if you're eating inside it can get pretty loud. Aside from that the food is consistently AMAZING, the pizza and sandwiches are all great & if you can snag a table outside on the patio it's 10/10"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite place. The pizza rates up there with Cibo for me. The appetizers were outstanding with fresh buffalo mozzarella, roasted tomatoes and spinach on ridiculously tasty bread and a bruschetta with prosciutto and fig jam. 

Great service and reasonably priced wines. 

What more can you want?  Add it to your rotation."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner this evening.  I was with a customer and his wife who recommended this place for dinner.  I'm trying my best to watch my carbs and ordered an appetizer of meatballs and sauce along with a salad.  The meatballs were sooooo good.  Qty 4.  In all seriousness I really wanted another order but didn't want to embarrass myself.  The tomato sauce was very, very good!

Everyone enjoyed their pasta dishes, one of which was the seafood fettuccine and if it was half as good as it looked then I understand why his plate was \"licked clean\".

Service was good and the cocktails were perfect!

A great Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went back and tried a few specials they had including the Pulpo (Marinated octopus) which was outstanding!

They still have service issues when busy. Bartender seems overwhelmed and even if you sit at the bar, it's not good services. All three times I was there he forgot at least one drink order or my food order. Not good. 

They appear to be understaffed which is probably an owner/manager issue.  

Overall I think the pizza is good but I would try the specials before I'd order pizza here."}
{"text":"This place is a step up from the former location on Roosevelt. Full house, buzzing with energy on a first Friday. We lucked out with a table on the patio. 
- The house red wine is a tasty steal. 
- Arugula salad fab with toasted almonds, plenty of good shaved cheese, and just the right amount of dressing. Definitely recommend.
- Burrata bruschetta had potential- good bread, but not enough cheese.
- The anchovy+olive pizza were perfect with a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. 
- The \"heirloom\" was pretty good, too, with thick slices of tomato. I wanted just a bit more flavor, so we topped it with some of the dressed arugula salad- winner!

Will definitely return, and hopefully get a seat at their patio bar."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Their Heirloom Tomato, Mozzarella & Prosciutto Panini was the best I have ever had. I liked it even better than Bianco's. My only wish is that you could order a half sized or side salad to go with it. I think the Panini's are better than their pizzas but I have only had one. The service is great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a long day of spring training and beer tasting...holy s**t. The gnocchi is a perfect balance between dumplings and pesto, the pizzas are divine. This is going to be a new regular stop for my friends and I on our annual trips."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this after going to the museum! The owners suggested a appetizer to start with and I was hooked. I kept my order simple with a   pizza. It had fresh tomato sauce that was to die for. The portions sizes were really filling and they even make homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"We were craving some pasta and decided to visit this semi-upscale place. There are only a few options for pasta on the menu, but they do pasta right. Their cream sauces aren't too thick and the flavors are well balanced. I think they're more known for their pizzas.

The roasted meatballs were so-so. Nothing to write home about in my opinion.

Why my review isn't perfect: I was expecting more mushrooms in my mushroom ragu, it turns out more like a brown-meat sauce with very few mushrooms. For the price, I guess I was expecting out of the world, but instead I got 'very good.'"}
{"text":"Far and away the most authentic and delicious Italian food. It feels like you are in Italy! All the staff speaks Italian and the owner does a fabulous job of making you feel like a guest to his kitchen. Daily pastas are out of this world. Also love the eggplant parmesan!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian oven fired pizza, this is your place!  Awesome bruschetta, delicious salads, tasty paninis and inventive pastas round out the menu.

The staff is attentive and brings the old world to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Word of advice:  Stop reading this and drive over to Forno 301, now!  Hands down the best Italian food in the Phoenix area.  The pizza is phenomenal. The pasta is all homemade. The red sauce is sublime.  (What my grandma would call \"gravy.\"). This is not Italian-American immigrant cooking.  It's much better.  A flight to Florence is the only way to equal the meal.  I won't make a recommendation for a dish to order.  Get anything you want.  It will be delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant of all Phoenix. As someone who grew up around good Italian food on the east coast, it's often hard to find good quality, authentic Italian cuisine out west. However, ever since I started going to Forno that changed! They used to be located on Roosevelt in a smaller building, and recently upgraded to a large space off central and McDowell and its BEAUTIFUL. The food is astounding, authentic, and made from quality ingredients, and quality chefs. The staff always makes you feel part of their family, and treats their guests to an authentic Italian experience. Would recommend to everyone, and anyone! Make sure you check it out."}
{"text":"We went to Forno because we wanted somewhere close to the Phoenix Theatre but with a more robust menu than the Phoenix Theatre Bistro. It's right across the street so very convenient.  The pasta was delicious (I had the Gnocchi and it was as good as I've had in Italy).  I wouldn't be surprised if they make their own pasta on site.  The server treated my mother-in-law like she was his own grandma and when we mentioned it was my husband's birthday we got 3 free desserts - all delicious."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizzeria who serves a few (2-3) specials a day,  generally one pasta and one meat dish. The owners are friendly and very entertaining.  Great place all around! !"}
{"text":"The staff was very rude. The kitchen closed 1 hour prior to close--  having been informed the kitchen closed at 11pm on a Saturday despite the restaurant being open until midnight. Will not be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with my mom and I'm finally getting around to post this! We'd been wanting to try this place for awhile and I'm SO GLAD we did! It's probably the best Italian food that I have ever had. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious! The service was fast and accommodating! We started with a bruschetta and it tasted amazing! Me and my mom both ordered entrees (fettuccini and the cheese ravioli) and it was absolutely outstanding! Both pastas tasted perfect! The sauce was a very good taste, and not to heavy! We also got a salad, and their balsamic dressing was awesome! Last but not least I had an amazing homemade custard with strawberry sauce for dessert! Had an awesome server who gave the recommendation of trying the custard, and was very polite and outgoing! Will definitely see us here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Hmmm....I was expecting better. We shared the capresi appetizer which had practically no basil or balsamic vinegar/olive to speak of. I'm comparing it to the capresi salad at Time market in Tucson near the University which is so flavorful that I could eat it every day. Forno 301's was boring, as was the boring ravioli which was in melted salty butter-oil mixture and really, the salt took over. No complexity at all, and what ever flavor was there...well, just salt. Would have been nice with maybe a little garlic to take your mind off the salt. I'm comparing that dish to the Mickey white pasta at Federal pizza, which is so good and complex, your taste buds do jumping jacks. And finally, my husband's bolagnais was not the best at Forno..it felt like the meat was so over cooked that it was mush. We haven't tried the pizza, so I would want to try that. Chairs are hard, and table top rocked because it needs to be fixed. Nothing I tasted, I would crave or order again. Sorry."}
{"text":"The best pizza I ever had, friendly Italian owners and delicious food, the prizes are reasonable and is 100% recommended"}
{"text":"This is the real damn deal. 
I felt like I was a true guest of a loving family. It was a dining experience. 

Best pasta I have ever eaten. We shared the spinach ravioli and gnocchi. Good god. The pear salad was perfection. 

I was serenaded in Italian for my birthday and treated to delicious tirimasu.

Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I do not think it is unreasonable to ask a service provider to be so kind as to close the door of a restaurant on a 95-degree high noonday; keeping it open, with the thermostat at 74-degrees, as I was loudly educated, appears to be an odd fiscal decision. 

Then to be humiliated while the grand jester and master of ceremonies asks the people lunching at the bar if I am going through menopause was more than enough. The word in Italian is cafone?! 

Lucca and Sandra, you make the finest Italian food I have ever had in Phoenix; your food is like being in Italy or New York. Grazie Mille!

I regret to say that you have lost a customer, a new and loyal customer, who has raved about your restaurant and in the short time that I have lived in the Roosevelt District, which is a month, I have been there at least 5 times; I have been proud to bring friends and family.

Tomorrow, I was going to bring my father in for lunch.  

Lucca and Sandra and Angel, I wish you continued success; you deserve it. The food is divine and your personalities are friendly, and lovely. 

I will miss you, but I've been embarrassed and humiliated too many times by your partner to return. You remember the night he refused to give me the check and let me leave? The night he wouldn't let me take my food to go? The evening he told he wanted to make a pizza di cane al forno? 

A piedi nel tempo di 95 gradi oggi e viene chiesto se ho avuto la menopausa in della barra intera, era l'ultima paglia. Arrivederci, grazie e auguri per il vostro successo. Abbracci per quasi tutti!"}
{"text":"Best gnochi a bolognese I ate away from Italy.
My friend's pizza were to die for too. We all really enjoyed the food and the service.
Roberto, the owner, is a bit rough in dealing with clients, but honestly,  his food makes up for his \" attitude\" . I will go back over and over again."}
{"text":"Ignore any negative reviews from Yelpers who don't know authentic Italian pizza. Came to Forno around 11:30 pm on a Saturday night after a Dodger's spring training game. We were hungry and searched Yelp for an Italian restaurant that was still open. When we arrived, there were only about 3 other parties in the dining room. The owner (I never caught his name) seated us and was extremely friendly. And not just fake friendly but down to Earth, make you feel like you know the guy, friendly. He was extremely attentive to us the whole time. The food was delicious and authentic (at least three of the workers, including the owner, were Italian)! There's a wood-fired oven in the back of the dining area where the pizzas are cooked. We ordered a Margherita pizza, a Sporcacciona pizza and a calzone. All were delicious. Before we left, the owner gave us a free tiramisu, which was scrumptious! If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely visit again. Thank you, Forno!"}
{"text":"They have the best wood fired pizza around! I really enjoy their house wine. The atmosphere is relaxed. Everyone that works here is really friendly. Every time we go downtown we stop in for some delicious Italian."}
{"text":"Nice little cozy place, clean and organized. Run by family I guess. Good service overall. Nothing special, mostly ordinary Italiano dishes. The owners ate nice and serve on spot. A little bit dark for me since I prefer light. Found parking spot easily as they are located behind. The pizza crust is perfect to us, not hard not spongy."}
{"text":"One the best pizza in Phoenix area.....credetemi,e in piu' sono molto cordiali."}
{"text":"Fuggetaboutit. Forno is my favorite pizza place (and I love pizza). The best part is the atmosphere. The first time we went there, they greeted us like were family. The pasta specials are always good; we get a pizza, a pasta and a salad. Plenty of food for my wife and me. 
I will miss the homey little place on Roosevelt but with these guys, they could make me feel at home in a football stadium."}
{"text":"Great outdoor bar where one can easily converse with strangers.  My stranger and I shared food even though my wife and her friend were there beside me.  I had Panni.  Wife pasta bolanese. Friend vegetable pasta special.  All were delicious  ."}
{"text":"The food we tried was all very good. The Calzone, Pizza and antipasto plate were wonderful. The service on the other hand left a lot to be desired. It is a small place, we did not have reservations, so we sat on the patio, forgotten on the patio."}
{"text":"Four of us went last night and all of us will be back and soon! Excellent pizza (we had two different pizzas, the 301 and their version of a white pizza with a name I can't recall) shared by all in addition to fantastic eggplant and a cauliflower appetizer that must be tried! Roberto was attentive, humorous and fun! Great neighborhood spot for us, and if you don't live nearby it's certainly worth the drive to this little Italy!"}
{"text":"This is too easy. Have you lived in Italy? Not \"Little Italy\" or some other Italian district in some American city, but truly in Italia. Well, if so, get ready for pizza like you remember it. There are not enough superlatives in the English language to do justice to the food at Forno. This is how Italian food was intended to be, forget any pseudo Italian food knowledge you may possess. I love this place! Buon Italia!"}
{"text":"Amazing food  great wine and overall good experience! Will come back when I travel to Phx"}
{"text":"Once you enter the door you are a friend! The service is warm and attentive! The salad is large enough to share and the bruschetta is a wonderful way to enjoy their wine! The pizza is perfectly crusted and the desserts are to die for... Try both of them... Cream br√ªl√©e and tiramisu! Top of my list of favorite dining in a comfortable setting! BJ"}
{"text":"Legit Italian.  My GF says their lasagna is the best she's ever had but they don't always have it.  It's a pasta of the day.  I like their Calzones and Sporcacconia pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. The food was fresh and the service friendly! Recommend the ravioli."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in the entire valley//phoenix!! Such simple ingredients, but so flavorful!hands-down the best egg plant Parmesan I've ever had in my life... I don't even like cold pizza but their pizza is good to me even when cold!  They're all from Italy and don't speak a ton of English which is why this place makes me feel like I am right at home in Italy. Thank you forno!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE EVERYTHING. That is all!!!

The owner I swear is always there and literally shows love to all his staff and guests who come to visit.  Anytime I've visited I feel like a celebrity which of course makes me love this place even more.  I've been here when it was in a previous location and love the new location right under the Muse.  Pizza and Salad are a dime a dozen but take all my moneys because this place you can taste the time they put into EVERYTHING.  The dough, the dressings, the wine selection are something to admire.  The atmosphere is casual yet wouldn't hesitate to come suited up or just in a t-shirt and jeans.  This is a perfect neighborhood spot whether you are looking to eat like a champ or grab a quality bite and drink.

I suggest the house red for sure and of course the pizza because what else kills the guilt of a day than carb loading and vino chasing!!!

Any chance I get I'm always coming in."}
{"text":"Loved it! They were very welcoming and very funny! Food was out of this world, the Diavola pizza was/is my favorite! The restaurant was very nice, modern with a rustic twist! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The place situated in a new condo/apartment complex and the interiour is cold and far from \"home-y\" or comforting. 
The Diavola pizza is still lackluster with super watery \"sauce\" and the sausage topping doesn't have much of a spice to it. The crust isn't bad.
BUT they speak in Italian accents so there's that ... I guess."}
{"text":"We're all for trying new locally owned pizza places. Although considering some of the best locally owned establishments are within a 3 mile radius of this place, I've become somewhat concerned that an oversaturation will inevitably take place. In regards to Forno301, I was quite surprised that I've driven by this little eatery many times. If you blink, you'll miss it, as it doesn't quite stand out amongst the other buildings in this neighborhood.

The set-up and ambiance kind of reminds me of Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, sans their bizarre obsession with 90s R&B music playlists.

We opted to start with a Bruchette that featured burrata, tomato, and basil. I've never been a big fan, as I feel that quality bread needs nothing more than a bit of oil olive to be truly appreciated. Nevertheless, it was actually decent.

For pizzas, we chose a standard Margherita as a baseline and the Testosterone, which features one of the most underutilized ingredients on a wood-fired pie (the fried egg). While the ingredients aren't quite up to par with what I've had at other places, they were passable. What really turned us off, however, was the crust. As another reviewer pointed out, the crust seems to take on this bizarre flavor of a saltine cracker. Airless, crunchy, and offensively salty. Initially, I didn't mind it, but its novelty (which I'm pretty sure is unintentional) wore off very quickly.

For dessert, we opted to split the chocolate cake. The size itself was the equivalent of those Little Debbie brownies AFTER you cut them in half! In fact, a dried out brownie is essentially the best way to describe their version of \"cake.\" It's not even worth your time.

Maybe I would have went a little easier on this place with a 2-3 star rating if it wasn't for their abysmal service. Some of the worst we've ever experienced (and we dine out 3-4 times a week!). The restaurant was by no means crowded. There were maybe four tables with customers, including two guys at the bar. There were three or four employees that were constantly zipping by, never checking up on us and never offering refill our drinks. When our pizzas were served, I was not provided a clean plate, so I had to physically snatch one myself from their stash. I'm still not sure who our server was, as they all seemed to in a constant, but highly disorganized rotation.

When it came time for the bill, we waited and waited. People kept walking past us, but no bill was provided. In fact, waiting for the bill actually look just as long as placing our orders, waiting, and ultimately eating/finishing our food! We were just sitting there, looking increasingly annoyed, and absolutely no one seemed to pay attention, despite not being busy at all. Are you serious?  

Generally, I like to visit a pizzeria at least twice before posting an honest review, but this is one instance where we have absolutely no intention of ever returning. I'm sorry, but I can list at least five pizzerias within walking distance of this place that absolutely excel in both their food, and more importantly, the quality of the service provided.  

We won't be back - and I'm fairly certain that based on how preoccupied their staff was - they will neither notice nor care."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Super food!  Reasonable prices!  Friendly and efficient staff.  Becoming my hang out!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza baked in the classic Italian style. Homemade limoncello available. Caprese salad to die for. And the proprietor is always in a good mood and will make you laugh your ass off. Check it out after a visit to the art museum across the street."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about all of these new little places popping up in downtown Phoenix. I'd heard a lot of good stuff about this place so I decided to take my family. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by this extremely charismatic and personable man who was clearly native Italian. We were seated and the rest of the night kept that same welcoming feeling. The servers were great, the food was absolutely delicious, the ambience was relaxed and fun, and prices were reasonable. We all had a great time and we'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian pizza place I have been to in Phoenix. Lasagna was amazing too! Super friendly staff and service. Deserts are amazing and hand made too. Very authentic. Definitely going back. You can't order anything that is not absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Everything from the staff to the ambience was great.

The staff was efficient and pleasant (I even saw a couple of them dancing to the music playing)

The food. Oh my goodness, the food. We started with bruschette with heirloom tomatoes, basil, and burrata. Perfectly crunchy and the flavor combination was on point.

I had the ravioli and my spouse had the gnocchi. Normally, I'm a fast eater, but with the ravioli? I savored every bite. By far, the best ravioli I've had. Of course I tried some of the gnocchi as well, and that was almost as incredible as the ravioli.  Have I mentioned how good the ravioli was?

For dessert, I had the creme br√ªl√©e and thoroughly enjoyed it. My spouse had the panna cotta, which I may have tried to steal. It was that delectable!

I absolutely recommend Forno 301, and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night with a table of 9 friends was a blast!  We had great service and amazing food.  Thank you Roberto, Luca, Angel and Millie your desserts were sooo good.  Always a good time any time we stop in.  Thank you.  From Juanita, Juanita Jr. Etc"}
{"text":"Really tasty! We got the pasta of the day and the homemade ravioli, and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great atmosphere, great service. Made my brother's birthday a great experience. Would definitely recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone. It looks nice on the photos, but the service and food were not at the level of a \"true italian \" restaurant. If you are looking for real italian pizza go to Cibo or Pomo."}
{"text":"Real legit Italian restaurant, and I'm Italian 100%, from Italy.
Home made pasta, home made everything, wood fireplace for the pizza, everything from the appetizer to the dessert is amazing, 10/10 for this place!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza  and Ravioli's and cauliflower and. . . AND!!!!! Great way to celebrate my birthday!"}
{"text":"I tried the vegetarian pizza.I love the crust and the texture.
The only problem might be parking."}
{"text":"I wrote a lengthy review, took me about 20 minutes, got wiped out because of a password glitch, not going to re-write the whole thing...three things from previous review:

Food above average, service dependable, not friendly.
Too loud, owner/bartender - tone down the language please, there were children within earshot."}
{"text":"After spending the day at the Phoenix Art Museum, stroll on over to Forno 301. They specialize in wood fired pizzas, Italian style cocktails, and freshly made pasta. 

I loved the simplicity and the freshness of their cocktails. The Ormea and Gabriele were my favs. Great citrus flavors perfect for summer. The bruschetta features crusty wood fired bread. I got the prosciutto with fig jam and Gorgonzola. Super tasty and perfect compliment to the art at the museum.

The only downside is the service is really slow. I went for a work happy hour and we were rushing to get to an event. Took a long time to get the check, or a second drink."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. I mean really. I'm from NYC. I know pizza. This is the place. Ask for dessert not on menus. Like cannoli. Ciao."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since they opened and look forward to going again. The food, wine, and dessert have all been delicious! Most of all I love the people that work there. Very welcoming, do not rush you, and friendly."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to attend their grand opening and the pizza was FANTASTIC! It is real Italian pizza with fresh ingredients.  Forno 301 is a comfortable, fun place to hang out and seems to be fairly close to the light rail too. My family is definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I had such a great meal here! Cute little place. Great pizzas! 

Good date night spot!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and service.  We celebrated a birthday party on the patio last night with around 20  people and the delicious food never stoped coming! Absolutely amazing, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"menu is short. the pizzas are ok. the gnocchi and eggplant parm are so fresh tasting and delicious. the negroni and other cocktails prepared wonderfully. love coming here when wanting to relax and not cook. a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I felt
LIKE I Was
In Europe
All night!!! I really loved it. The food was the best everyone was having a great time and wanted all others to join! Just what the row needs!!! Great great pizza"}
{"text":"Love it -delicious and very close to the pizza from that \"famous\" Phoenix place, we can all not ever get into."}
{"text":"I had been planning my 30th birthday party for months,  doing research on restaurants and hotel to cupcakes.  My favorite food in the world in pizza,. When i found out this place was ran by Italians I was hooked,  then reading reviews got me even more excited to celebrate my birthday dinner at Forno 301. 
I called two weeks in advance to inform and ask about reservations.  I was told I'd be called 5 days before event for confirmation.  I was called the morning of my party,  and for a second time confirmed there be at least 10- 15 people attending at 8 pm, two weeks prior and morning of party.
When myself and gusts arrived to Forno 301, I was greeted by Roberto,  behind the bar.  He asked how many people. When we arrived there were only 9 of us,  with more showing up.  I told him there will be about 10.. he had table set up for 8. When we sat down, there were still more people to show up and I ask for additional chairs for more people in my party showing up, he then \"joked\" around with me,  saying I don't know what I'm even talking about.  
I get that Italians are passionate people,  but I've been confirming all along for at least ten people,  at least.. I shouldn't be scolded for their lack of planning,  or communication. I was looking forward to a great birthday dinner.  
With that aside,  I got over it,  didn't take it personal,  even though I am a little sensitive, I let it slide. We got our drinks ordered and food order in and enjoyed the evening.  
Angel was our server,  he took a group photo of us and we were appreciative. We only got offered one drink,  and myself being the birthday girl, did not get the attention from the server I assumed I'd get. He also told my boyfriend,  \"if we were planning this,  we should've given a notice or made reservations\"... I did twice, and said 15 people each time!! Because people change their mind last minute, only 11 attended, but I did everything I was supposed to and felt awkward with the outcome. 
Although the pizza was great and the ambience is very cozy, I just would've appreciated to feel special and prioritized, especially for my birthday.  
I'm going to give it one more chance.."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good prices.  Wonderful servers.  Very fun.  Roberto the bartender and owner brings a wonderful Italian flair.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here alone in the middle of the day on a Saturday. the ambience was very nice. The waitress I had was nice but could have been a little more personable. She was not happy that I asked for a high table, which seats 3 and I was only one. But she was nice the remainder of the time. I ate a pepperoni pizza and it was very good. They're filtered water they serve was also very good because this Arizona water is disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food is exquisite as well as the service. So happy these guys moved to the neighborhood... Although there are 2 other pizzerias close
By that compare, we choose these guys! Love the authenticity"}
{"text":"Amazing as usual. Been here several times. Always the best - sporchociana the best.  Roberto and staff always great."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, as I am an avid supporter of local establishments. However, this place fell short of any expectations I may have had. The owner seems pleasant enough, but our server wasn't quite on par. My husband asked about house wines, and 2 recommendations were given: a \"pinot\" and some white wine. He assumed the pinot was red (why give 2 white options?), and so he ordered it. He got a white wine (which my husband can't stand). We brought this to the attention of our server, but she didn't seem too concerned with the fact that he wasn't happy with what he was brought. Because he didn't want to make a fuss, he went ahead and drank it, but it was clear from his facial expressions that wasn't what he wanted to drink.

We asked to start off with the burrata, followed by a margherita (our go-to first time pizza order). I was shocked what we received both items at the same time! I thought that, being an Italian eatery, time was to be stretched out and the meal to be enjoyed.  The burrata came out as bruschetta, and there were minimal amounts of cheese.

The pizza left so much to be desired----the sauce was too sweet and didn't have a lot of depth. Nothing special about the crust, either. I was pretty much done after the first slice, but forced myself to eat more. Needless to say, I went home and just didn't feel satisfied.

On a non-food note: interesting music choice: there was a 90's soul Pandora stationg streaming (with commercials) throughout dinner. The music was loud and the random commercials distracting.

Overall, very underwhelming experience. Not sure if it's due to being a brand new restaurant, but this place is not on my list when it comes to good Italian food. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Where to start other than this place was absolutely de-licious! Took a recommendation from our hotel the Found:Re around the corner and was not sorry!

The place was packed when we arrived and. For good reason, but we waited only a few minutes for a table. It's lively, loud, hot, and feels like we were transported back to Italy with food quality to match! 

We ordered the 1 - Salad much like a house salad with kalamata olives, feta, and a vinaigrette worth drooling over! My husband and I devoured it! 

Next was our to die for pizza - I had the Margherita and oh my goodness was it amazing! I've had quite a few wood fired pizzas including in Naples and this one was right up there with it! The mozzarella was perfect, the sauce was fresh, I'd go back today for more if I could! Spot on! 

My husband had Sporcacciona and literally finished every last bite even all the crust and hasn't stopped talking about it since. 

If you are in the area, do it, stop by, get pizza, and order some more for us too!"}
{"text":"The pasta is excellent. Gnocchi with pesto and pasta Bolognese, especially. The panini was sub par. There are only four options for wine by the glass and they are all not good. Service was quick. Tables are close together inside. Recommend sitting outside, ordering pasta, and buying wine by the bottle."}
{"text":"Of the glut of pizza joints in central Phoenix this one stands out. The interior is tight like any small local pizzeria but it breathes of life and vivacity. Some may find the proprietor Roberto garish but it is with this Italian charm that the vibe comes together. I feel like I'm at a friendly urban house party and that happens to serve great food and drinks."}
{"text":"I loved the owner and the food was amazing!!! I definently have to recommend the FORNO 301, the owner came out and served us, i thought that was so cool! The atmosphere right on the street with that porch is PRIMO! The italian food is not flashy at all, it is as if you went to a small pizzeria within Rome and ordered food! The accents are thick, the wine flows free, and the heat from the pizza is on your cheek. Check this place out, I would recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"Ravioli was the best I've ever had in life!  Sorry I had already eaten half of the arugula salad  Authentic Italian food with great customer service. I am going to miss when they move to their new location....no longer across the street from me but only a quick light rail ride away!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix!! Better than Cibo or Pizzeria  Bianco! I am so thrilled it finally opened! However considering its within 100 steps of my front door, it is proving to be quite dangerous for my husband and I. The owner is so so friendly and even gave us a discount on our pizza!! I highly recommend checking this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was very awkward and unfriendly. We didn't even end up staying to eat because it was a very uncomfortable atmosphere. Maybe the food is good but I guess we will never find out."}
{"text":"The hubby and I walked here last night for dinner. We had the oven roasted meatballs, the linguine with pancetta, and pasta of the day which was ravioli filled with beef filet and a yummy au jus Sauce. The tiramisu was divine!  We even got the mushroom and sausage pizza to take home because we hadn't had enough! Oink! Seriously, everything was obviously home-made from scratch, cooked perfectly, and so uniquely delicious. We will go back to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and nice ambience! We received good service as well! We had pizza Bianca and the pizza they have with lots of meat! Very good"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch at Forno 301 new location at 1616 N Central Ave at the corner of Central and McDowell NW corner. Same wonderful food and staff, now much more room and ample shady outside seating. Wildfires cauliflower with b√©chamel and bolognese sauces, Delish! Parking a bit tricky must be heading south on Central and just before the intersection there is covered parking garage for free. Look for Muse Apartments and Forno 301 is right on the corner first floor! Will try to add a couple of pictures."}
{"text":"Cute place!
The owners friendly and plays fun music that he dances to. 
It is truly like being in Italy where you feel you are in a family run establishment and the owner is your host for the evening. 

I gave it only 4 stars only because the food and beverage list is a bit limited but the service, food, and drink were all great. 

Pizza and Bruschetta are the main extent of the menu. They are generous with their portions of prosciutto and other toppings. 
Red or White are the only two options on the wine list. I picked the Red which happened to be a Cabernet and it was very good. 

Will be back for more authentic Northern Italian Pizza and vino!"}
{"text":"I tried Forno 301 on a whim this week, and I am glad I did. This is a pretty small restaurant, but very cute! We ordered two of the bruschette, #3 and #0. The 3, was the least favorite dish we tried, the meat was very fatty even for prosciutto, and it overpowered all of the other flavors. But the 0 was delicious! The cheese and tomatoes were fresh, and the bread was nice and toasty. I ordered the Homemade ravioli, just yum! The pasta was soft and delicate, it was filled with cheese and herbs, placed in a light butter sauce, it was fantastic! My friend ordered the 301 pizze, and it was delicious. The pizza crust was thin and crispy, the sauce was light, but full of fresh tomato flavor! The reason I gave this place a 4 was because the service was less than great! The majority of the staff that we encountered seemed pleasant, but our server was not. She didn't crack a smile once and each time we tried to order, she started walking away before we were finished. This was the only reason I didn't give a 5, so I would definitely recommend getting some food, at least takeout."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious! Although I could eat many slices every day, I have to admit that Phoenix is becoming saturated with all these PIZZA NAPOLETANA places vying for the attention of a small foodie population. But while most of these joints are locales to see and be seen, Forno 301 simply cares about loving life and making good food. 

The menu is VERY simple. You've got your choice between red and white wine, like 3 different cocktails, and very few varieties of pizza. I guess it's more easily understood as the In 'n' Out model, where by limiting choices you can really excel at a few things. 

So I sipped on a very reasonably priced aperol, gin, and grapefruit mix (I love bitter! Legit!) and watched them place an order in the oven. The owners are very talkative, and come off as some of the most genuinely kind individuals I've ever seen run a restaurant. I wonder how they ended up here, of all places? 

When our pizza arrived, I was excited, but had reservations. Quite frankly, I can describe it most accurately as \"Just one notch below the top pizzas in the valley, but at a significantly lower price that makes the compromise easy to swallow\". I mean, the sausage was amazing, but whyyyy are the mushrooms canned? The sauce also seems canned, albeit the best canned sauce money can buy. The mozzarella tasted pretty good, but had a texture suspiciously on the waxy side. I am by no means saying I didn't enjoy my meal, but that you should lower your expectations from mind-blowing to above-average before you come here. Instead of a 5-star pizza at a 5-star price, it's a 4-star pizza at a 3-star price. It works. 

\"Every time you come, I will teach you a new word in Italian\" said the tall gentleman with a thick accent as I prepared to leave. And even though word he taught me (Quick! What's Italian for \"Good bye\"?) is already forgotten, the pizza was not...guess I'll have an excuse to come back, and hopefully try a variety of pie even better than what I had before."}
{"text":"This place was a great discovery. More than the delicious food it was the whole Italian experience. I happened to go on the night they were closing (moving to a new location). They served delicious dishes. It was unlike any Italian food I've had before. Everybody was so friendly. The owners are charismatic and attentive. I can't wait to visit their new location."}
{"text":"Maybe the best Italian food I have ever eaten and the owners make the experience top notch!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome with amazing food! From the great atmosphere, to the awesome service, it's a place you don't want to miss out on. The minute you walk in you are welcomed by the owners who make you instantly feel at home. The flavors of everything I've tried are delicious! The menu is not overwhelming and has many great options and they always offer daily specials. Everything is so fresh and so delicious. Do your mouth a favor and check out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My boyfriend and I made last minute reservations just hoping it would be pretty good and we were blown away! The ingredients are so fresh and the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town! I tried the 301 with sausage, mushrooms and onion...... Simply incredible!!! I'm Italian and When I come here i find the true Italian taste!!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix! The margherita pizza is to die for and the linguini special with clams, mussels and shrimp was like going back to Italia  for a moment. Thank you Forno 301! Come vogliamo benne!"}
{"text":"In October we were in Tuscany for two weeks, and enjoyed a number of great meals. Walking into Forno 301 was like being transported back to Lucca, to enjoy great food.

We were started off with roasted califlower in a tomato sauce that was delicious. The Forno 301 pizza and house special chopped salad of the night, with arugula, radicchio and fennel, were both delicious. The house vina rosa is a very good compliment to the courses. The service was great, and they're passionate about their food.

I'll definitely go back and recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday after getting a haircut nearby.  Sat at the bar and was greeted immediately.  Went with a pizza that had prosciutto, artichokes, olives, and a few other ingredients.  Pizza was very good and you could tell everything was fresh - only thing that could have been improved upon was the crust as it was a little soggy.  Price point is perfect and I would certainly return.  If you are in a hurry, this is probably not the spot for you."}
{"text":"Pizza and salads are fabulous! Love all the desserts! Roberto and Luca are very personable! Great music!! And wonderful specials. Had eggplant parmigiana today and it was awesome!! Definitely a yummy place!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Another great addition to the Valley pizza scene.

The owner is super friendly and you can't go wrong with getting either pizza or a pasta here.  I have tried the pasta once (they have a pasta of the day) and it was a perfectly al dente penne pasta.  Not over-sauced and came out piping hot.  It was quite good.

So there are a ton of pizza joints to compare this place to, all Neopolitan-style of course.  We got Bianco, Pomo (multiple locations), La Piazza PHX (and sister restaurant), etc.  Having ordered just the basic margherita from all these places, I would say Forno is at 4 stars.  It is a very, very good pizza, but doesn't quite reach 5-star pizza level like Bianco or Pomo.   My main knock on this place is that the pizza comes out just a liiiiitle too wet in the center compared to the other places.  But the cheese is good, sauce is tasty, and the crust comes out blistered enough to warrant a 4-star review."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of trying to go to Cibo on New Year's Day, but luckily Yelp showed me This place close by. I called to see how late they were open and whoever answered the phone was so jolly and obviously Italian, we drove right over. The service is slow, but It didn't strike me as disorganized. It seems cultural, like you're sitting in their house while they prepare dinner. I had gnocchi pesto which was delicious, my boyfriend had the prosciutto crudo pizza, and my friends had the arugula salad and the chicken parmigiana. Everyone loved it, we loved the atmosphere, the portions, the flavors, and the fact that we got to walk in through the back :). We also had creme br√ªl√©e and cappuccino to round it out, and we left very satisfied. I think diners these days are too demanding, and expect people from other cultures to jump when they snap their fingers. It's disappointing. I loved every moment in this restaurant. If you go, expect to have to make conversation with your friends. Maybe also chew slower, and savor the time you're sharing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Italian pizzeria, you found the right place!
Pizza, homemade pasta, great ambience.
The service is awesome - very welcoming too. 
Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Trendy and cheerfully loud. Stylish crowd. Pizza sauce too sweet for me, calzone had too much crust. Delicious grilled eggplant appetizer. Cauliflower appetizer was cold below the cheese. Lackluster Misto salad. Overall ho hum food, with the copious Italian bread the star of the meal."}
{"text":"We visited this enjoyable restaurant last week while in town on business.  Our party arrived a few minutes early and sat on the open air side of the bar.   Reasonable prices in the drinks and very good service.  

We were seated promptly and ordered several starters. Sampled three of the wood-fired dishes. The meatballs were excellent. A tasty serving of 4-5 large ones arrived in a marinara sauce.  The disappeared quickly. Maybe we were just hungry?  The eggplant was just as good.  The roasted cauliflower surprised us all.  Great beginning.  

All of the pizzas looked great.  Mine may have been a fraction underdone for me, but the flavors were excellent.  

I tried two desserts. The Creme Brulee was a good /classic version and the Tiramisu was very tasty.

The staff at Forno 301 is very good.  I won't say professional because they were having way too much fun taking to us.  The partner/bartender was friendly and entertaining as he chatted with each of us.  He really made us feel at home.  A great casual place for a relaxing evening of very good food and beverages!"}
{"text":"I drive by here everyday, and today my husband and I stopped in for dinner. We ordered an appetizer special, and two pizzas.. I just have to say this is the best pizza I have ever had. we are both Italian, and this is authentic. The staff is so friendly also. definitely a hidden gem!! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing Italian guys who treat you like family. Simple. The burrata bruchetta was awesome. Pizza isn't my favorite but there are plenty of reasons to visit here. Mainly for the vibe and the bruchetta. But talking to Luka and Roberto makes it all worthwhile. Super friendly Italians that make sure you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The food at this place is literally so good that I am currently sitting AT the restaurant yelling how delicious it is. Amazing olive oil, we had the caprese salad, which comes with crusty bread and prosciutto, the pappardelle ragu, and pizza. All of it was authentic Italian and absolutely incredible. Atmosphere and service are just right. Five stars for sure"}
{"text":"Gave it another try when a girlfriend was in town, pizza was still a 3, nothing to write home about. They had a calamari dish that was so delicious, the marinara we got with it was also complimenting. The house wine wasn't bad, it was priced nicely. The pizza dough doesn't have much flavor. The server was good, attentive and always on top of everything. Unfortunately they had an odd smoke out towards the end of our meal and it was AWFUL. It was so Smokey, many chefs were leaving the kitchen and our eyes were hurting and we all had to leave. I'm sure it's an isolated incident but maybe don't sit by the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until a couple friends suggested to meet them there.  It's a great spot right on McDowell and Central.  I was hesitant about parking, but it was easy to find, clearly marked, and FREE! What more could you ask for in downtown Phoenix?

Wine list and cocktails were both impressive and reasonably priced. We tried a couple different dishes that were all great, but the pesto pasta was amazing! 

Everyone on staff was nice, but one man behind the bar was extremely charming and lovely. Wish I remembered his name! Can't wait to go back and see him again.  Hoping to sit outside in the beautiful weather."}
{"text":"i have never actually been in to forno 301.  i've only ordered delivery through uber eats.  after my last experience i will no longer be ordering their delivery let alone ever step foot in this establishment.

after a mix up with a delivery order not being confirmed, then cancelled, was then followed by a phone call by me to an angry and confused owner, who ended up hanging up on me.  i was just trying to confirm yelling and screaming was his way of handling the situation apparently.  i called my husband to ask him to grab dinner on his way home because our order at forno 301 wasn't being made.  my husband ended up driving to forno 301 to try to reorder and pick up the order i had placed online.  unfortunately the owner was rude to my husband while he tried to explain about our cancelled delivery ordered. the owner finished with \"i don't deal with women on the phone\".  at that point my husband went straight to cibo, got our take out and called me on the way home to let me know we weren't allowed at forno 301 anymore.....my husband wasn't a fan of the owner degrading his wife so he made it known - enough that a few patrons started clapping hahaha!!!!!

we always loved the food we had delivered.  it was some of the best pizza.  unfortunately because of the owner's style of handling his business and his apparent views on women, we won't be back...allowed or not."}
{"text":"I had a sample of some pastas and pizza everything was cooked perfectly. The tiramisu was delicious."}
{"text":"I went for dinner not knowing it was the grand opening. I was told by one of the owners that it was the grand opening. I was told to basically piss off and wait for as long as it took. No direction at all. He kissed his fingers and as far as I know in an Italian insult to piss off and wait. I have always liked this place and have been multiple times but I was very insulted by this particular owners lack of professionalism. I have always liked this owner but will never look at him the same way. As far as the food it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Utterly charming and delicious.  The staff, well they're all from Italy.  The pizzas are thin, crunchy and cooked to perfection.  The pasta is made in house and I would highly recommend both the Ravioli and brown butter with sage or the Pasta Carbonara ...both were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great quality for a great price :) Their new location is very nice. Taste so much better than other pizza places in the area where prices are much higher."}
{"text":"Brick oven pizzas and panini. Had a pizza. Didn't taste bad but was very skimpy on the toppings.  Felt like I was just eating bread and sauce"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! I feel as if I have been transported to Italy- the Diavola pizza is amazing , the prosciutto crudo bruschetta awesome and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience!

I went with my friend, and we split a bottle of red wine and thought we'd split two plates of pasta. I got the ravioli, and she ordered the gnocchi. We both reluctantly shared a little after our first bites, since it was so amazingly delicious that neither of us wanted to give any up. My ravioli had the best butter sauce on it. I don't hesitate to say it was the best ravioli I've eaten in my entire life."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I had the Margherita pizza. Best I've ever had, hands down. Authentic Italian."}
{"text":"Excellent food, recommend.  Had the diavolo pizza, tomato cucumber salad, and pasta of the day.   All excellent and freshly made.  The greens seem to just come out of the garden.   

As the other reviews say, service is a bit unorganized, but good enough.  Appears family run. Recommend."}
{"text":"This is for new location at McDowell and Central. Short version is good was ok. Service was horribly slow. Noise factor was so bad we had to shout at each other. Their decor is mostly hard features so going to have some echo. But they chose to play music too loud to compound the issue. Back to service-I don't think they have been open at this location very long so maybe just working out bugs. But we sat for five minutes before someone came over and gave us water. Finally had to get up and go find a waitress to even get a menu. Spent about another 20 minutes waking for check. Tried to give her credit card so we wouldn't have another big wait but she dropped check and bolted away. No food is good enough to put up with this level of service."}
{"text":"Great food but bad service this time around. I would come back because I have been before and everything was great. Tonight our server barely came to the table and was unfriendly. Luka G. was our server and he could have cared less about serving our table. We had to flag him down to have our order taken. He gets two stars but the food, atmosphere and the rest of the staff were wonderful."}
{"text":"Roberto and Luca are the best. I get scolded by them if I don't come in often enough - and my taste buds agree. Best pizza in all of Phoenix, but branch out and try the pasta of the day. No matter what it is, it's always magnificent. If you're looking for dessert, my favorite is the panna cotta."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is homemade in the very best sense of the word. How lucky for the folks that can claim this is in their neighborhood! Original. Delightful. Will be back"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for one of their birthdays. The prices are decent... was $12 for a pizza and sodas are $2. I tried a piece of bruchetta that the other people who arrived before me had ordered. It was interesting with fig jelly. When it came time to order they said we had to order a pizza off the menu; we couldn't create our own. However we can take stuff off of it. So we got one with just bacon, sausage, and cheese. There wasn't too much cheese on it, but the sauce was fantastic. The pizza wasn't very filling but was fairly good. This is definitely more of an authentic pizza place so don't go and expect to order a large pepperoni. They did give my friend a tiramisu and she said it was AMAZING! They also sang to her in Italian."}
{"text":"This has become our go to Italian. We entertain guests or just walk over for a small bite by ourselves. We were lucky to spend the past two summers in Italy and can vouch that not only is Forno autentico, it is superior and more affordable than many of the highly rated ristorantes on the Boot. The friendly family service is like the best we saw in Rome and Napoli. Bravo"}
{"text":"Time and time I have come back to this spot and received authentic and quality service. It reminds me of a home style kitchen where you can come in and feel welcomed but not overwhelmed. Sometime, usually in a chain style restaurant,  the staff is overly enthusiastic in fear of a secret shopper or bad review. At Forno the staff feels like family, they offer guidance and suggestions without breathing down your neck or interrupting your experience. I am so happy Phoenix has this local gem and hope to see their success roll through the years. If you are looking for a restaurant with a causal vibe, delectable food options, wonderful, friendly staff and most importantly a culinary experience (don't be in a rush, that's not how things work there) then this spot is well worth a try. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Like going to your family's house for a home cooked meal!!  DELIZIOSO!!  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Super authentic experience eating amazing Italian food! Limited menu, but all made fresh and with great presentation. Tonight we had the cauliflower app and some pizza name i couldn't pronounce but was delicious. Service is a little slow, maybe it's an Italian thing? Will be back just to hear more Italian, all of the staff speak it fluently!"}
{"text":"My partner and I started off with the burrata bruschetta then for the mains had Margherita pizza and the house made spinach and cheese ravioli covered in a butter sage sauce. Everything was delicious and fresh! Starting from the bruschetta, the cheese was just so flavorful and fresh and the aesthetics with the baby yellow tomatoes was beautiful. The pizza was great, actually had a cooked, crispy thin crust. For the house made rav, the pasta freshness could be tasted and the sauce was buttery and delicious. 5/5 for atmosphere! All the staff were friendly and inviting look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Ignore any bad reviews. Everything from the house wine, to starters, to pizza and pasta...so good. I'm still thinking about the ravioli. The owner is so welcoming and incredibly nice. We pretty much had him pick all of the dishes for our table and we couldn't have been happier. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for awhile - love a good pizza place and heard good things

Entered the place through the gate - place is very cute. Definitely modern and \"hip\". 

Im a BIG pizza fan and this was probably the strangest pizza i've ever had. The best way to describe it was...the pizza was \"wet\". Not greasy because i love some greasy pizza but the ingredents and top of it was wet. Just wasnt impressed at all. 

Like others, we waited for SO long for the bill. I'm all good for not being rushed and i was with good company that we could chat all night but 30+ minutes was redic. Plus never got offered a refill or water filled up. 

Probably wont come back. Hope they do well. I love a local spot in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"This is serious 5 star materials, I just need to have a second wonderful visit to bump it up. I came here with my mom and the husband for my birthday and it was definitely a great choice. This little restaurant is super cute, kind of rustic in decoration, but comfortable. We got many items to share and I don't think I had a bad bite all night. We started with wine, which is a bit odd since they just say 'red or white' and give you some random wine, but it was fine. The service was good, I believe we were waited on by an owner and he spoke mostly Italian to us all night... that's kind of fun. For food we shared the 301 salad (amazing tangy and flavorful dressing, goat cheese, heaven) and 3 pizzas (margherita - very good basic pizza, the one with onion and sausage... really  tasty and fresh, and the best one - prosciutto.... so fresh and delicious, I want another right now!). All of the pizzas were simple and fresh and had a wonderful thin, but firm crust... I think I ate 10 slices haha. My mom was impressed because when she asked for oregano, they came out with beautiful whole leaf dried oregano (no flaky shake stuff)... it was awesome. For dessert, they graciously brought out a flourless chocolate cake, which was rich and delicious, and we ordered the tiramisu, which was served in a jar and was one of the best tiramisus I have ever tasted.... creamy, rich, espresso -y, chocolaty goodness.... I licked the jar. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"One can't go wrong eating here. Busy, local, and culinarily exquisite. Save yourself the round trip airfare. Eat here"}
{"text":"Currently my favorite restaurant for Italian Fare.  The Pizza's, salads and panini's are all fantastic.  They always have a pasta special, and the eggplant that is always on the menu is delicious.   Always very cozy with a great vibe to it.  Luca, Roberto, and Mele are doing a great job with this downtown gem of a place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here, no doubt.
The reason for my two stars is because he my mother and I were treated at this establishment. I had been to this place a few times prior to taking my mom and loved it! 
So my mom and I are seated and provided menus. I let the owner know we were only coming in for desert (the coffee cake- which they didn't even have that day). She told me in a rude way that we couldn't take up a table only for dessert. Then said she would let it slide this once after seeing the looks on mine and my moms faces. 
The funny part is it was in the afternoon with plenty of tables open. This happened at their previous location which was very small compared to the new one. 
It was a disappointing experience, but I will say the food is good."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza and amazing service. My family goes here every weekend...not sure if its because of the food or because of the friendly owners!! They have an amazing pepperoni mushroom pizza that is to die for. Ive never had a bad dish here and ive tried everything on the menu! Their house wine is also tasty."}
{"text":"Work in the area, decided to check them out. I received the most awful looking pizza EVER!!! NOT ONLY WAS IT COLD, it had what resembled puke, a hint of the smell, and was very soggy. I will never PATRONIZE that place again......I didn't notice until the second slice. I feel very sick!!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for a drink and a bite before heading down to the Diamondbacks game.  Service was great and drinks were reasonably priced.  They have a limited bar so don't expect a bunch of options.  It was a Tuesday night so it was very crowed but I can't say there was any special vibe, seemed like there was a number of regulars. Now to the food, well it was really lacking.  Had the Margarita pizza and Mix Greens salad, the salad was good but the pizza was well definitely not 4 1/2 stars.  The crust was under cooked for my taste and the sauce didn't add much enhancement to the experience.  Overall 3 stars, definitely not 41/2 that my fellow Yelpers have given.  Probably the first and last time I will make the trip."}
{"text":"The Pizza was a bit too charred for me, leaving something to be desired.  The fettuccine is good- and their bolognese sauce is more cheesy than meaty. Just visiting heard about this new spot from a friend."}
{"text":"Okay i know its hard to mess up a pizza right. ...okay i tuink its easily as hard to get it really right and boy do they. The crust is perfectly crispy and the cheese hood quality. Good sauce ratio and very fresh tasting. The hospitality was great. They did let us bring our dog on the patio which for us is a big deal because we work all day and are defenitly guilty dog owners. They past, had the bolognese was clearly made fresh in house. It was my favorite. The deserts (creme brule and tiramisu) were amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What an amazing experience. I was with friends who are major foodies. We'd heard about this restaurant, but hadn't had a chance to visit. If you are in downtown Phoenix for dinner, and you want authentic Italian, Forno 301 will not do you wrong. We started with the Arugula, pear, Pecorino cheese, with lemon Pecorino evoo dressing. And the focaccia de Recco . To quote my friend, it's a little slice of heaven. Two slices of focaccia, and in between was mozzarella and prosciutto, fired to perfection. We then moved on to the lasagna. Again, amazing. It had the consistency of gnocchi with a smoky meat sauce. The Sporcacciona pizza, with fresh mozzarella, fresh tomato sauce, prosciutto cotto, bacon, sausage and salami was simply incredible!!! We shared a bottle of Soline Santi wine. Best match I've had in a long time. Again, if you are the n Phoenix give this place a try. You'll come back."}
{"text":"Foods great, locations nice, ambience is very cool, service sucks.  If you can accept the latter go. Better than Cibo IMHO"}
{"text":"Great dinner! Roberto, as always, was gracious, kind and so hospitable! Kelly was our awesome server and Shae was wonderful! Can't wait to return! The new site is beautiful and it was so high energy!! Food was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place.  SO SO good. The owner is amazing- Roberto. The staff is amazing. This place is going to blow up. Going to be right in the running with cibo and bianco. It is a very small place but you can tell these guys know how to run a restaurant. 

Oh yeah the food... Is amazing. Could of ate 2 of the brick oven pizzas. The menu is small but you can tell everything is very fresh. I will be back soon and frequently after that!!"}
{"text":"Holly sh*t!!!! This place is unbelievably delicious!!! The ravioli is to die for! My sister and I tried everything on the menu and I must say \"WOW\" what a gem in Central Phoenix!  Place is super cool, lots of wines and beers to pair with your food.  I almost want to keep this place to myself but the world must know how delicious it is!"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The food was pretty good. But the drink prices pretty much on par or a little cheaper than other bars in the area."}
{"text":"Nice find. Recommended by friends. Nice neighborhood feel. Authentic, cozy & reasonably priced. Will def return"}
{"text":"Great little spot, snug seating but the food was on point. Some of the best pizza in Phoenix and the two Italian gents added an authentic element to the whole dining experience. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there yesterday and I miss it today. This place is so great! I feel like I went on vacation.Roberto is so fun and welcoming and the food is amazing. Thank you to the whole crew for creating an experience that I savored and want to have every day!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice location on the corner of Central Avenue and McDowell Road. Free parking in the apartment building but it on the light rail. Great outside seating. The service is better and I think the food has improved since they moved from the Roosevelt location. My second time at this location. Last time it was very busy Saturday evening. Tonight is Thursday and only 3 tables so far but I'm sure it will get busy. The food is very good."}
{"text":"I liked the place, the service and the menu.  I had the pasta of the day. The Il Forno.  It was way too salty. I could hardly eat it. 
 The arugula salad is one of the best salads I've ever eaten. 
Hubs had the antipasto. It was ok.  I sampled some decent capocollo and cheese from his plate."}
{"text":"Best Italian I've had in Arizona! For sure one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Place is small and crowded so I definitely recommend making a reservation. We had to wait for around 15 mins and the waitress was kind enough to let us know that the empty tables were for reservations. A lot of people talked about the salad and they are right. Delicious! But the pizza and the pasta are amazing!! The pizza has a very thin, crunchy dough. It's very light so u don't feel so heavy after eating it. The pasta is undescribable! Best bolognese sauce! This place is authentic Italian, not olive garden Italian. So if u like that crap, this place is not for u."}
{"text":"After reading the outstanding reviews we drove from Goodyear to check it out. My husband had the lasagna which was over salted. I had the vegetarian pizza which was okay....crust was soggy on the bottom. If it hadn't  been for the terrible service....we were never asked if we wanted another drink, did we need anything else, did we want desert, how was everything.... we would have given this place another chance but I doubt we will come back. This is disappointing because it's a nice restaurant with a fun atmosphere. Service is every bit as important as the food."}
