{"text":"Horrible Pizza, Horrible Management. The pizza took 90 minutes to arrive, and was cold and over cooked. The staff is rude and very unprofessional. Will not order again"}
{"text":"Very good pizza pie Jon! Great quality and service. I needed some specialty pizza information and the person taking my order over the phone was patient, helpful and nice even though they were very busy, They also didn't charge me any extra for modifying one of our pizza's. Lots of fresh toppings, good non-soggy crust so overall a great pizza. And if you like leftover pie the next day, I would say it's the best next day pizza I've ever had. I'll be back! 4.8/5."}
{"text":"Jon's pizza was sold awhile ago (changed hands at least once) and once it was the best pizza I've ever had hands down but won't be ordering again. Last two times the pizza was raw in the middle, and when I say raw I mean raw dough - disgusting. I did call to let them know and was told that next time I ordered to ask for well done. Well, I did and I got \"well done\" enough said, won't be ordering again. Sad, because I don't order out much as I make my own pizza (so easy to do and so much cheaper) but it was nice to have somewhere good to go when you did order out."}
{"text":"After Moving to the south I have always ordered pizza from franchises. The north had a ton of great little pizza places so I am extremely grateful to have stumbled onto jon's pizza! The toppings and cheese topping was generous and overall so delicious! Extra cheese is not required. Not only was the food amazing but the everyone was so friendly. Highly recommend if you are even reading this review."}
{"text":"We just moved to the SE in June and are so happy to have found Jons. The crust, the sauce and their fresh toppings are fantastic! We have found our new pizza joint :)"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Jon's customer for 7 years and I have nothing but good things to say. I saw another review on here about a change in management at some point and that is false. Same person has owned it for years and still Owns it today. They are bringing back old favorites from when I first had their pizza and I'm so happy. Lasagna, wings, even meat pies! They are awesome!"}
{"text":"For me, it's a slice that will stick in the old noggin'. Our painting crew was working nearby and I was looking for a quick bite so I could get back to things. I found Jon's on GPS, decided hey - let's get some grub. I went in and asked if they had pizza by the slice. It's a small place with a counter and a bench to sit and wait. It's not a sit down place if that's what you're after, more of an order and pick-up or have delivery kind of deal. A man I'd like to picture as Jon, gave me a pizza by the slice that was huge. It was even the last slice so it would have been cold, but Jon warmed it up in the oven, no microwave. It took longer but if it wasn't worth the wait I wouldn't be writing this. Sauce was awesome, lots of cheese, ham was sheets of ham style not cut up chunks:)). I had mostly ham, pineapple, and cheese - and also part beef and other delicous. I had both because this piece had multiple kinds -  it was a mix peice and I accepted gratefully because I would love to have many flavors, yes thank you. I feel like I'll always remember the crust. The crust was soft and crunchy at the same time. My co-worker wonders if the crunch came from the reheat - I have no idea, I guess I'll have to try it without. But if it was the reheat I'm just glad I got to hang out with that crunch. The people working there seemed down to earth, professional, and good humored. I took the slice to go, parked by location for lunch and mowed down. I was for whatever reason not expecting this to be so delicious. It consumed my lunch hour thoughts and then more. I thought maybe I'd run out for a quick dry, old, cold slice, wishing I'd packed a lunch that day. I would have been fine with that. Maybe since it's Friday I've been smiled on:)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the SE!!  Family-owned business with great service!  Pizza had a generous amount of toppings and cheese and was piping hot when I picked it up.  It's my new favorite pizza joint!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Jon's for years. Over the past year the quality has been steadily declining. From tasteless pepperoni to always soggy crust and less than appetizing sauce. The quality of ingredients obviously makes a difference to a pizza. I would rather pay a little more for quality."}
{"text":"If you want to support a local business - go no further, Jon's is the best. Just try it and decide for yourself. Perfect topping to crust ratio (not thin crust if that's what you're looking for). They recently updated their ground beef recipe - super flavourful! The guys are hard working and just make great pizza."}
{"text":"Jon's Pizza is a hidden gem, buried in the 'burbs just off Deerfoot & Douglasdale Blvd.  It is easy to miss!  They are tucked into a strip mall, share an exterior entrance with another business & is strictly take out.  Often, if you go in to pick up an order, you will see Jon himself working away!  He looks an awful lot like his caricature on the menu. So cute!  Plan on it taking a few tries to get through on the phone.  Especially on the weekend.  Also, plan to order at least 45 minutes ahead of time. Trust me - it's worth the effort.  Jon's spares nothing!  The toppings are loaded on. Piles & piles of whatever you order. If you order a square pizza, plan to get an upper body workout from just carrying your pizza out of there. Feels like the thing weighs close to 8 lbs (I've never weighed it, but it's plenty heavy.) I usually am good with one piece - two if I'm super hungry (& I can usually polish off half a pizza if hungry enough - just not Jon's version.)  They double bake their pizza - this gives you a nicely browned cheesy top, sealing in all the flavors & goodness. Nothing quite like it.  A particular favorite is back bacon, green pepper, pineapple & feta.  When I moved from the deep SE back up to Brentwood for a short time, I was known to make the cross-city trek just to pick up dinner from here.  I can't even blame pregnancy cravings for it.  It's just that good!  Go. Now."}
{"text":"Yummy! When we order pizza, this is the place. I made this MISTAKE once of ordering extra cheese. Let me tell you, you really do not need it. The pizza is terrific with heavy toppings, and you only need to eat one or two slices it is so filling. My favorite is the all meat with mushroom. Fair prices also."}
{"text":"I read all the good reviews and decided I needed to try it.. Not in my top 100.. Crust was way too thick, and sauce was ok at best. Honestly had good and bad points, just bad out weighs the good...  And the Caesar salad was a soggy mess."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the SE.  Thick and plentiful, lots of cheese and piled slices of meat.  2-3 slices and you are more than full.  Sure it costs a bit more and the place is always busy, isn't that the whole point to a good takeout?  Been going here 10+ years and always come back for more, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not big on pizza - but as far as pizzas go this was pretty tasty! So cheesy! We ordered take out as there's no seating and when we arrived to pick it up it was hot and heavy waiting for us! Yes heavy! Thick crust fresh tomato sauce (but not overpowering) and toppings. We got 1/2 Greek and 1/2 deluxe - both of us liked the pepperoni side better as there was a better flavour but both were good. They charged us the cheaper of the pizzas rather than the more expensive so I thought that was really nice.  The staff were super friendly and I enjoy the bright green pizza boxes.  They have specials if you order two pizzas too, and seem to always be busy - free delivery to the neighbouring Douglasdale and an online menu too!"}
{"text":"Went downhill since owners changed. Skimpy toppings so i never go back anymore. In this economy people only go to where they are getting real good food or they just stay home."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Calgary! Ordered the house special! Thick and Delicious! Fresh veggies and lots of them.  Will be my go to when I am in town."}
{"text":"I've been going here for my pizza for years. It's not like any other kind of delivery pizza you will get. It's super cheesy and just outright delicious. I love their pizza, some of the best."}
{"text":"Last few pizzas were not good,especially the beef and onion,pretty sure it was under the warmer for some time, very dry and  felt lime leftovers, just saying"}
