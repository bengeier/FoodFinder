{"text":"I've lived in Calgary for over 11 years, and when my family and I dined at Ginger Beef on Country Hills, we all agreed this was the best Chinese dinner we've ever had in our time living here - and we've had our fair share of food at popular and \"well-known\" places.  I want to walk everyone through the dining experience to give the proper credit this restaurant deserves.

Walking into the restaurant, the place was packed!  The first good sign of a worthy restaurant.  Even though we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated (we didn't have a reservation), the front staff were very pleasant, assured us we'd be served within the stated timeframe, and they called us by our last name when it was time (never had that happen at a Chinese restaurant since I'm usually designated as a number). 

When we sat down, I (being the youngest male at the table) was nicely greeted by a waiter and asked if I wanted a drink from the bar.  He was dead on regarding more than a couple of things:  1) I was in dire need of a drink, and his ability to identify that demonstrates an innate closeness with his customers, even new ones; 2) He was able to pick out the most likely drinker at the table, given my family is generally in an older generation than I; 3) He spoke in perfect English, which was great for me since I'm not so comfortable speaking Cantonese - this further elevated my confidence in myself to speak Cantonese in the future.  Honestly - has any waiter at a Chinese restaurant ever greeted you so warmly with such keen marketing sense?

We ordered the house special soup, Peking duck, deep fried pork chops with onions and peppers, fatty pork on preserved cabbage and onions, gai lan with beef, and house special fried rice.  All great dishes and I would highly recommend them - especially the fatty pork.  Not only were the portions more than enough and the quality well beyond expectations, but it came within 5-10 minutes...ALL of it!  At this point in time they were serving the soup as well and portioning it out into individual bowls - the nice lady pouring the soup was doing it with the ladle in one hand, but also holding another table's heavy pot of soup.  This highlights two things:  1) She cannot leave her customers unattended, and will go to great lengths to serve them (even holding a large pot of soup); 2) She is extremely skilled in what she does, and this reflects only the most pure corporate cultures where the employees truly value their jobs.  Also, the whole restaurant displayed great teamwork - when another waiter saw the nice lady pouring soup and holding a big pot, he simply tapped her on the shoulder and she went to the other table, while he served ours.  Great stuff to see!

A few more things to note:  the tea pots were ALWAYS being refilled, and that is a sign of a good Chinese restaurant.  I must've drank three pots myself given how fast they were keeping it filled.  Also, when I returned home, I wasn't even thirsty, which is indicative of the low usage of MSG and other preservatives in the food, which usually cause you to become parched 30-60 mins following the meal. This engenders even more credit to the aforementioned bartender - he was offering a drink for the purpose of pure enjoyment, not simply to quench thirst transpired by MSG.  Additionally, the two owners were very present.  They were busy getting their hands dirty helping with table set up / cleaning, and interacting with all customers.  It's always nice to see the big bosses on the floor with their employees and customers.  Furthermore, we were given actual lap cloths which is certainly not typical at a Chinese restaurant (usually receive a pile of napkins from a metal container).  The restaurant not only appeals to ethnically Chinese people, but Caucasians and other ethnicities were sprinkled throughout the restaurant, a true testament of the restaurant's ability to appeal to a variety of cultures and races.  Finally, the open-kitchen concept is a great feature.  Not many Chinese restaurants do this, at least for those I've seen, and it offered a \"cool\" twist to the typical Chinese dining experience.  And price-wise, if you thought Olive Garden gave you value, wait till you see this place.

All in all, I am definitely coming back here.  These guys have been quite well-known in Calgary, and they are doing a great job at keeping their reputation."}
{"text":"I've never quite understood why it gets busy here as I've never found their dim sum very good. The only reason we come here is because it's just a tiny bit cheaper than another well known dim sum place 5 minutes away and they don't charge for tea. Their kitchen is also open for viewing as it's only separated from the dining area by glass so at least you know your dim sum is pretty sanitary.

The skin/wrap on everything that is made in-house is super thick and/or hard, the food is \"roughly\" made (not delicately like dim sum should be) so one order of siu mai can get you 2 or 3 different sizes and shapes, the portion sizes of everything can vary greatly, sometimes they over cook things, and the taste of everything is definitely sub-par. The appearance of certain items will also make you think \"what happened?\"

A few of the waiters are nice but there are a few who aren't and service can be quite slow. They also skimp on sauce dishes so some items may come with the sauce already on the food instead of separately like every other place does it, which means you can't control the amount you actually want. The last time we went, the portion sizes have gotten smaller on certain dishes. Overall, nothing on the dim sum menu has wowed me as I've had much better elsewhere.

Their dinner is meh. The only thing I can recommend is probably the peking duck as everything else is not very flavourful and on the smaller side. We haven't been there for dinner in a long, long while as we've found hair in our food twice on separate occasions."}
{"text":"Have gotten my order wrong the last 4 times. Even though I clarify and confirm that the order I am making is correct. They seem to not understand customer service at all... Do not order take out from here if you want to avoid a headache."}
{"text":"YUM! I am new to the dim sum world, but I enjoyed every bite.
Keep in mind-how you order your food is by filling out a sheet of paper, and then you have to find a waiter. They don't come to your table and ask, fine with me because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Other than the address being wrong (posted in Yelp) this place is great.. service was wonderful...and the food absolutely delicious. Too bad i was eating my myself and could only order two dishes..... because some of the dishes i saw passing by me only means i will be back."}
{"text":"I had dinner this evening at the Ginger Beef Bistro. I had a very strong allergic reaction to the HIGH LEVELS of MSG in all the food I ordered. After I came back from the bathroom the waiter admitted to me and my lady friend that there is alot of MSG in their food and then explained to me that he thought that many restaurants use MSG in their foods.  I was so shocked!  I then asked him if any of the food in the meals from the Ginger Beef were organic or local.  He said that most of their food comes from Sysco and they import some in but all are conventional foods that are NOT free of chemicals.  We simply must be more selective when it comes to the food we eat in Calgary.  I wish more restaurants would make an effort to provide less chemicals in their food."}
{"text":"Pretty damn authentic Chinese food up in the NW! Coming from Vancouver and being spoiled by the vast amount of Asian restaurants, finding a Chinese restaurant that doesn't cater to the western culture is hard to find. 
The second surprise to the food was the above par service. We we're greeted politely and was asked how our food was. Which NEVER happens in a Chinese restaurant. I've also had dim sum here once and my stomach was satisfied with that meal as well. 
I would definitely be back again to satisfy my Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but service is not.
There are one or two \"Managers\" walking around the floor and you can never find a smile on their faces. They will just stare at each table as if we are prisoners, very annoying.
One of the young male waiter is very rude. We have a table of 10, and we ordered what we wanted before the last  two person are here. So we ask him not to send in the orders yet. And he was like \"when are they coming in?\"  and show tremendous annoyance. We ordered within 5 minutes after we sat down, I don't think its too much to ask the restaurant to hold on to the order for 5 or 10 mins? My friends arrived 5 mins later. 
Anyway, if you can stand to bad service, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Horrible. Not good. The ginger beef was unrecognizable as beef coated & deep fried, no taste of ginger & some kind of sweet dark sauce. Expected sliced fresh beef with fresh ginger. We ordered the dinner for two, wrong! The chic fried rice was tasteless. The sweet sour pork was hard thick and crusty and fatty. I gave it one star for the won ton soup. Sorry we're from California we had higher expectations."}
{"text":"This place is quite far from my home but well worth the drive. Absolutely the best Peking duck I have ever had. I have eaten here many times and is consistently great. Has really delicious ginger beef and western Chinese dishes but also some really great traditional Chinese dishes and a very nice dim sum."}
{"text":"Went on a really busy day and the customer service was pretty decent even with all the people milling around. Had to wait around for a little while though before getting a table. 

The food was also very good, had the classic ginger beef which is my personal favourite as well as some of the chicken dishes, etc. All good food, good service."}
{"text":"Nice renovations. Interesting concept with the floor to floor glass wall on to the  kitchen. I think their redeeming quality is the 'atmosphere' and decor. Service and food are just alright.

Been here twice. Once for Dimsum and then for dinner.

Went very early for dimsum on a weekday. When we called in the night before, they told us they opened at 8am, yet when we arrived at 9:30am, the signage on the door indicated they opened at 10am. So basically the person on the phone was not well informed at all... Dimsum was okay. A little overpriced. Extremely disappointed with their Shanghai Dumplings, they gave me the impression of drowned wontons. Liked the deep fried shrimp balls.

Dinner was also just mediocre. Peking Duck was a little dry. Portions were smaller. However, I don't know if it was because it was a month after I came for dim sum but the Shanghai Dumplings were much tastier! They also had a pan fried chicken dish that was good.

I will come by again someday and hopefully see if the food improves any."}
{"text":"Totally worth the drive across the city!  We brought a visitor from Ontario for the Alberta creation, and it was wonderful. All the dishes were, including the Candied Apples for dessert. Leave room for them: enough for the whole family."}
{"text":"food is pretty good, if you can handle the salt and MSG. Clean cooking area which can be seen through a glass wall. Pretty nice staff."}
{"text":"Although the wait for a table for dim sum was around 20 mins, it was worth it!

Food was freshly made and came out shortly after we ordered. 

I've ordered out a few times before and the food has always been great, this was a first for dim sum and I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Went here for a dim sum lunch. Overall the food are great and staffs are friendly. The dim sum are authentic and the variety is good - lots of steamed items that I personally like"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Calgary for Peking Duck.  They also have great dim sum! If ever I go to Landmark Cinemas on Country Hills Blvd.,I always stop here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Just picked up beef with broccoli and curried beef. Pricier than other places yet I counted exactly 7 slices of beef in the beef with broccoli. Curried beef is 75 percent onions. It has exactly 8 slices of beef. Avoid this place if you actually want meat dishes with more than a few slices of meat."}
{"text":"The ginger beef is delicious. 

I like to be able to see into the kitchen! Looks clean. 

Food is good. 

Service is fine. 

We like to bring the family and order lots of dishes. The prices are great."}
{"text":"We didn't have a very good experience here this last time. Things were definitely different from previous visits. 

We were celebrating a birthday party so we ordered the dinner for six. NOT GOOD. Lemon chicken was so tough that no one could eat it. Same with the incredibly red in color sweet and sour pork. Inedible. The ginger beef was alright and the stir fry mixed veggies were so so but the shanghai noodles totally lacked flavor.  Very disappointing. When we mentioned the problems with the pork and the lemon chicken, they couldn't have even cared less. And don't expect anything if it's a birthday celebration. They don't care. Period.  Not fun there. 

We definitely won't be returning any time soon. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Up in the NW there are not many awesome restaurants... this is one that we want to keep going back to.  The dried salt & pepper seafood dish at $14.75 is amazing.  We've talked about going there, and just getting two plates of that and some rice and veggies! It really is great - always perfectly cooked (squid is tender) and nicely seasoned, and it's a good price for a plate of seafood.  

We want to try the peking duck for sure, and also they BBQ their own meat. You can preorder a duck or anything else and pick it up with it's ready. 

The restaurant is always packed, and I think it's a good sign (and don't take this the wrong way) that it's always full of Chinese people. They have some traditional menu items available, so it's nice that it's not all westernised Chinese food - they have much more breaded and sticky chicken balls, sweet and sour pork and ginger beef!

I recommend!"}
{"text":"We picked up takeout tonight. The food was fantastic and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely bookmark this place for future cravings. :)"}
{"text":"Four of us went for brunch at Sunday 1pm. Waited in line for 30 mins. Good dim sum collections,??????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Only giving them a 4 stars because I love their desserts!  Their Stuffed Sweet Dumpling with Black Sesame and Egg White Red Bean Puff are DELICIOUS!  Yum!!  They make it fresh and when they serve it, they are still hot!  These two are a must try.  I recommend them.

I have tried both take-out and dine-in during dinner.  To me, they are just ok.  During dinner time, the restaurant does get really busy and packed.  So I think it's best to plan ahead and make reservation. 

I am a bit disappointed because everyone I talked to, they praise about  the Shanghai Style Juicy Pork Dumplings.  I think they are just ok.  Nothing too special in my opinion.  Their Fried Noodles are just ok as well, actually one of the fried noodle dishes we ordered came out luke warm which makes me wonder how long was the dish just sitting out there before it got served.  

Overall, food and service are average. The two desserts I mentioned deserve TWO THUMBS UP.  When I go back next time, I will try their Peking Duck which is also another dish people praise about."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. The dim sum is currently the best in Calgary where the basics such as ha gow & shiu mai (shrimp dumpling and pork dumpling), are consistently good. The crust on the egg tarts are amazing! So perfectly flaky and tasty! Theirs might be the best I've ever had (and I started eating egg tarts as a little kid in Vancouver).

The dinner here is also of great quality, with the standout dish being Peking Duck and the Shanghai dumplings. I also love the eggplant, egg tofu, scallop hot pot.

As for the service, for a Chinese restaurant (which generally have lower service standards than equivalent Western restaurant), they are pretty good. The people who bring the good out could smile a bit more, but most of the servers who take the orders and whatnot are friendly and efficient. Also, the restaurant is clean and it's neat to see the kitchen at work."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and the food was perfectly timed. It was the night before a day off and it was freezing outside so I wanted something good for two days so I could sit in comfort the next day as well with some good food. I ordered dinner for two and it fed me well both days. The chicken fried rice was great and huge portion. I tried the ginger chicken to try something new and wasn't too impressed. But the wonton soup and the beef with broccoli were delicious. Kept me fed well one evening two days for 30 bucks plus tip."}
{"text":"This review is for take out only which is amazing! This was our 3rd time tonight and the staff is great on the phone to speak to, very polite and makes a customer feel appreciated! The place is always packed and although there was a short delay for our food due to the place being so busy, there are a lot of other stores to stroll over to for some light shopping while you wait!
Ordered the chicken fried rice as always as well as the Singapore Noodles. One star I took off as I stressed EXTRA spicy to the kind cashier and somehow, the spice did not happen. This will not deter me from coming back to our friendly neighbourhood Asian eatery! The rice is some of the best we have had in Calgary!
Good portions!
PS
The fortune cookies here are deelish! Nice that a couple of those are always thrown into the bag free of charge here as some places to not do so."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can post that this place is good. The ginger beef was awful and so was everything else we ordered I would not recommend or go here ever again they have better food at deerfoot mall at chinese buffet atleast you can sift through the crap."}
{"text":"Awesome Peking duck. Great Saki.Great staff and very busy. looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Note: Rice is not included!! Food was honestly four stars, but the staff was a bit rude. This might because I ordered Take-Out and didn't add a tip. I am American and we usually do not tip on Take-Out that you pickup yourself. The interior seemed very clean and modern. In the back they had large windows, so that you could watch them prepare your food. I would recommend getting delivery instead of Take-Out."}
{"text":"Ok I'll admit it, I can be a little bit snobby and for a while, I've had snobby rants about how Calgary doesn't have any soup dumpling spots and needs to get it's life in order and move out of its parent's basement. Over time I've found SOME answers, but nothing too amazing to fully shut my dim sum eating pie-hole.  Is it just an online hipster food trend that most restaurants just don't see lasting for long or what's the reason? 

Anyways Ginger Beef has always cropped up in these soup dumpling conversations, but I always gave it a pass because it literally takes 50 minutes to drive to from my area. I might as well drive to red deer or Edmonton and make a day out of it. But when I found myself with an calendar-empty Sunday I made a straight shot and it was worth it. The soup dumplings, or \"juicy braised pork dumplings\" is legit. When I walked into the restaurant and saw an exposed kitchen (only separated by bulletproof glass) filled with a dozen cooks making fresh dim sum, I knew I had to get TWO orders of these pillows of soupy goodness.

And it's legit. I was satisfied. The dumpling wrapper was fresh and the soup was full of flavor, followed by a delectable chew of pork. It scolded the roof of my mouth and that's how it should be, because it's my sole responsibility as an adult to know how to eat a proper soup dumpling.

Aside from that, the dim sum here was good. A few \"mehs\" but there were no disappointing misses. Their ginger beef is savory and crispy, but not heavy on the sweet sauce and msg. The chicken and salted fish fried rice is a must. And their shrimp and pork shumai yield two big bites per person which is the perfect first bites to have. At the same time I'd recommend a better Gai Lan and beef tripe dish elsewhere.

Service was prompt and helpful, oddly enough one of the old managers here used to work at another Chinese restaurant we frequented for dim sum but closed, which was the only one located in South Calgary."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened in the old New Dynasty Restaurant location next to Studio 16.  We actually have been there twice already since its opening a week or so ago... once for Dim Sum and once for dinner.  The place is already well known, as the place was packed both times we were there.  The owners did a good job advertising the place in local newspaper and radio stations.  

Dim Sum - the restaurant has a good variety of dim sum on the list and prices are reasonable.  You can even see your Dim Sum being steamed/prepared in their Dim Sum kitchen, which is behind glass at the back of the restaurant.  I was sitting at the table right next to the dim sum kitchen, so we were able to see clearly what they were doing in there.  Some of dim sum are freshly made, like Siu Long Bao, Chinese donut rice crepes, and some of the Chinese buns.  Back to the food...  while they were fresh, they were not the best in the City but definitely above average.  We paid about $13 per person with tips included.  Now that we have this restaurant here in the area, we have a choice between waiting in long lines for dim sum at T.Pot, or waiting in slightly shorter lines here! 

Dinner - if you are looking for good Chinese food for dinner in the area, this is definitely one of the better place.  It is much better than the restaurant that it replaced, which was catered more to the non-Chinese customers at the expense of its Chinese customers.   This new restaurant seems to cater to both, and from line of people waiting for table, they seem to be doing a good job.  Service was good for a Chinese restaurant.  They have tons of serving staff to look after your needs.  The food was good too.  There are not many restaurants in the area that does Peking Duck and this one is above average for sure, but not as good as the old Ginger Beef in Sunridge Mall.  The Siu Long Bao at dinner time is the same as the Dim Sum ones, except they give you 3 more per order (the price reflects that of course)... and they are freshly made like they were at Dim Sum.  The rest of the dishes were good as well.  The nearby T.Pot will be the direct competitor to this restaurant when you look at pricing, quality of food, and location.  Of the two, I think I prepare this restaurant over T. Pot, because I think this one uses less MSG.  The dinner was about $28 per person with tips, but we ordered a lot including desserts."}
{"text":"always freah dimdum.  the chefs are behind glass so you can makr sure they are doing a great job with the food."}
{"text":"It's our favourite place for dim sum.  Great selection, tasty and always made fresh.  The dim sum are comparable to the ones in Hong Kong.  This means really good!  We also love the BBQ pork there, crispy skin and tender meat...something to die for!  Your experience there is not complete without trying the xiao long bao.  So glad this place is only 5 minutes away from our house."}
{"text":"Decent traditional Chinese dim sum place. Good food when you need a dim sum fix.  They have a large kitchen area that makes the dim sum , noodles, and the buns in house."}
{"text":"Always fantastic here. 
Best dim sum in Calgary. 
Dinner food is awesome with great selection. 
Highly recommend and very authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came here for supper with some friends, and we ordered the 3-course Peking duck and some other side dishes (steamed pork buns, as well as steamed plain buns served with sweetened condensed milk). The Peking duck dinner included the usual soup to start, then rice paper rolls to wrap thinly sliced duck pieces with cucumber, green onion, and hoisin sauce, finishing with handmade noodles (you can watch them being hand-rolled) served with duck meat. Ambience is more elegant than most Chinese restaurants, and they even have a fair selection of wines!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past and again today for lunch. First time back in a year but as always, dim sum has never failed me. I've never been here for anything else, but it's my favorite restaurant in Calgary for dim sum.

Food is always hot and fresh when ordered. So hot that it burns your tongue if you don't let it sit on your plate for a couple of minutes. I also think they make the best egg tarts in town as the crust is always flaky. I brought a friend here who is from Hong Kong, and she thinks the egg tarts are comparable to some of the better restaurants in her hometown. Portion size is slightly bigger for the price that is pretty standard all over Calgary (about $5 per dish).

Note that this location is the only Ginger Beef that serves dim sum of this caliber. Even if you're not in the area, it's worth driving up to the NW just to eat here."}
{"text":"Good XLB. Larger in size than most.  All the dishes are very good.  Their online ordering system is very quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Went there for the peking duck. You definitely have to try it! For the ultimate experience you have to get the crispy pecking duck that you cover with hoisin sauce, green onion, and cucumber, and wrap in a burrito bread. It's amazing!

Also, their ginger beef is fire and so is their sweet and sour pork. I'm telling you, go early too because the lines can get long, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Dim sum on New Year's Day!  What a way to celebrate New Year's!  We got there at about 10:10 a.m. and was whisked to a table for 4 right away.  The line was starting to build.  We checked off what we wanted to order on our dim sum list and the waitress came over promptly to fill our order.  We also ordered 2 dishes that start coming out of the kitchen at 10:30 a.m. but they all came out together with the rest of the dim sum dishes!!  

Highlights:  fresh, hot & piping dim sum served from kitchen to your table, chili sauce brought to your table without having to ask for it, ordered durian rice cake & pan fried turnip cake with XO sauce - both were supposed to come out at 10:30 a.m. but came out with the other dishes as I had mentioned above.  Both were delicious!!  We also ordered Har Kau (steamed shrimp dumplings), Sticky Rice, Taro Cake, Char Leung (Chinese doughnut wrapped with rice crepe comes with sweet sauce/peanut sauce), steamed BBQ pork bun, steamed whole wheat bun with coconut cream filling, braised chicken feet (could be cooked a little longer), pork & century egg congee.  All were delicious!

Will have to come back for more fresh dim sum!  Thanks, Ginger Beef!  In and out in 45 mins!  Serious."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Chinese food - that said...I felt like I was in a \"Seinfeld\" episode...and y'all know what I mean America....

Great food with an excellent assortment of authentic Chinese eats!  The dumplings stole the show in my opinion...but I'm also bias, I LOVE dumplings."}
{"text":"Where else can you eat dim sum AND peaking duck at 2 pm. Went in today for a late lunch with the girlfriend. Servers were attentive, which is rare for an Asian restaurant. Food came out in good time. The dim sum was HUGE and peaking duck crispy. The only thing was the rice that came with the duck combo was kinda bland for me. (July 12, 2014)"}
{"text":"I love the dim sum here. I also like the take out!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit the esteemed Ginger Beef Bistro in Calgary and of course ordered their famous ginger beef dish. I found the dish on the sweeter side of things, but decent overall. In addition, I was able to sample their lemon chicken. Unfortunately, the dish was disappointing as the sauce was too sweet and the batter chicken had little flavor.

Place was packed with patrons and a bit noisy overall. Service was reasonable and prompt. I also thought the restaurant was well maintained and appointed. Enjoy Calgary!"}
{"text":"This is our new family go to stop for dim-sum.  They have really good soup dumplings (Xiao long bao).   The food and service here is always great.  You can also make reservations when you have a group of 8 or more."}
{"text":"Impressive!

I am surprised that Calgary has pretty good Chinese food. I got the Xiao long bao (or soup dumpling), the lamb hot pot, yang fried rice and a vegetable dish. On top of it we ordered the beef soup.

The lamb hot pot is really good. No gammy smell.
The Xiao long bao has soup in it. This is a plus because the XLB is not easy to make.
The yang fried rice was ok. I mean I am usually not like a big fan of this dish. 
The ground beef soup was nice. Its almost like the cream corn egg soup but without the corn so its less sweet. Its not bad.
The vegetable dish ( not sure what its call) its good because it was stir fried with garlic. Anything with garlic is good. 

Décor is nothing fancy. Its a restaurant on its own building. Also this place is super busy and packed on the weekend. Come early or be prepared to wait

Highly recommend this place. Heard its the best Chinese restaurant in Calgary"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food in the city!!
They have the best peaking duck, ginger beef and dumplings.  You know when you arrive that it must be good when you see how busy they always are and you will not be disappointed.  
If your adventurous make sure to ask for the Chinese menu, there are some great dishes hidden on it!!"}
{"text":"Calgary doesn't have the best Chinese food offerings but this one is pretty decent relative to the competition available. it's a super busy restaurant so make reservations for dinner and prepare to wait a bit for dim sum. 

They are known for their xiao long bao Shanghai pork dumplings where there's soup inside along with the pork. The key to this dish is a really savoury and flavourful soup and a melt in your mouth pork filling inside. The soup was good and the dumpling skin was pretty good but the pork ball was more stiff then I expected. Stilll good but not great.

We ordered the ginger beef dish only because the restaurant is named after that dish! It was too sweet for my tastes but then again I don't normally order ginger beef for that reason. The lemon chicken was disappointing - lemon sauce was too sweet and the batter chicken had no flavour. 

For this place, stick with the more Cantonese style dishes - their seafood is exceptional. The halibut and a seafood medley dish with gai lan was really good. The peking duck was on par with most places I've dined at. 

Place is packed with patrons, service is prompt and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I always come here for dinner with my grandmother and we really enjoy it. We come enough that that staff usually remember us (good staff or we come to much). We usually grab the combination for 2 dinner, and let me tell you the portions are huge! I end up taking lots home eating for a few days so price to portion is great! Staff are friendly and polite so all in all this is a good place to eat Chinese... food"}
{"text":"nice clean contemporary decor and excellent freshly made dim sum. The steamed dumplings are outstanding!  You can watch them being made by master dumpling makers through the glass kitchen window."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum. We enjoyed siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, shrimp rice crepes, beef ho fun noodles, and egg tarts. All the food was very flavorful and well-cooked. The egg tart crusts were flaky and delicious. We had way too much food for the two of us, but were glad we tried everything we did. We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"What to eat in beef country? A constant dilemma during our travels out west. After scouring all the restaurant and review sites - we just relented and decided to go to Ginger Beef. We had visions of deep fried foods drenched in red sauces with a stale fortune cookie. What a pleasure it was when we arrived to see an authentic Chinese establishment.
We had a bit of problems with ordering and service, as most of the staff only spoke Chinese and most of the patrons were Chinese too. No biggie - we do this all the time in Toronto.
The food was good. Their signature dish is the Ginger Beef (big surprise eh?!?) and though a little too sweet for me, the kids were in it face first!
We ordered the hot and sour soup, snow pea leaves in garlic, cantonese chow-mein, chicken with veg and some other dishes. 
All in all, a good meal in cow-town...so good, we went back for dimsum next day!!!"}
{"text":"Truly a taste sensation, The ginger beef was outstanding. The coding was crispy the sauce just the right amount of spicy ginger we had a number of dishes each one of them equally tasty I highly recommend stopping here before or after a movie at the adjacent theater."}
