{"text":"I find I am typically underwhelmed when ever I eat at eggs oasis. The coffee is not great and the food is just OK. Maybe my hopes were high after having some great breakfasts at Nellie's, Dinner Delux and others of the sort. We still go from time to time as there are typically no lines and the food is not 'bad' but I would not overly recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Rating: ** 1/2 (out of 5 *)
Food: **
Service: ****
Decor: **
Bottom Line:  Sub-par food that was only balanced by good service.  There are way better places to go for brunch in Calgary with better food and personality.

My friend and I were looking for brunch so we thought we'd check the place out.  It was Saturday morning and was pretty busy with quite a bit of a line up.  However, the space is pretty large so we only had to wait about 10 minutes.

Food:
It definitely did not start off well.  They had a whiteboard with specials on coffee, one of which was for a salted caramel capuccino.  Sounds delicious right?  I'm thinking a frothy capuccino with salted caramel sprinkled on top.  Wow that was a big mistake!  It was nothing but some overly sweet Nescafe instant coffee mix.  

Given the name, I was expecting a menu full of unique egg-based breakfast items.  I was sorely disappointed since the menu pretty much contained your typical breakfast / brunch fare.  People are right in making comparisons to Cora's.

I ordered the Eggs Oasis, which is pretty much your standard brunch fare of eggs, bacon, sausage, beans and hash browns with the exception of the creton (Quebec pork spread) which I've never tried before.  Probably the tastiest thing on the plate, which really isn't say much.  The baked beans tasted out of a can and the rest were meh.

Service:
The service was actually quite good.  We were seated fairly quickly considering the lineup.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.

Decor:
It's a pretty large, bland and bright space but seemed pretty tight with the table layout."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. It was not super-packed busy but there were people there. 

Service Review:

The waitress seemed indifferent of us being there. She put our drinks and food plates on the table next to us instead of just walking around to where we were sitting to put the plates in front of us. Very weird. She even set our coffees at the end of the adjacent table as she \"dropped them off\" at the table. I have never seen a waitress not set my food/drink in front of me before. 

Food Review:

The food was absolutely DISGUSTING. We ordered the Florentine Benedict and the Beefsteak Benedict. 

First off, the Florentine Benedict was made with frozen shredded spinach heated up over the cooktop. It stank and was smothered in cheese. It was the most un-fresh food I have ever tasted. Just to get an idea of the food quality, I ate the benedict without the sauce. I could not eat more than two bites. We informed the waitress that the $14 benedict was inedible and she shrugged and charged us for it anyway. My boyfriend ordered the Beefsteak Benedict. The meat tasted like rancid horse meat. The eggs were poached with too much vinegar so that you could actually taste the vinegar on the eggs. A big NO-NO for good poached eggs. Neither of us ate our meals. Our bill was about $30 for the two sub-par inedible breakfast plates.

We left hungry.

Denny's would have tasted like a 5-star restaurant after this disgusting meal. Overpriced. HORRIBLE QUALITY. You can spend $30 for two people at MUCH nicer restaurants for breakfast in Calgary.

Do everyone a favor, EggsOasis, and close your doors!"}
{"text":"Marvelously underwhelming. The coffee tasted like diluted sewage water, the whip cream was tasteless oil, and the hollandaise sauce was terrible. ... At least the service was good."}
{"text":"Waited over an hr to get seat, I was a party of six, didn't mind wait but parties of 5 were sat before us, strange. Manager was very disorganized didn't have control of line up seating. Also we should of know when we hear others complaining they had receive wrong orders. We also had received wrong order and food was cold. Over all we were at this restaurant for greater than 2 hrs I will not return not worth it and manager owner didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a new taste for breakfast in Calgary.  Boy did I find it! Disgusting!  I ordered the hunter omelette,  I would like to know if this hunter has ever killed anything bigger than a mouse. No meat all processed cheese and bagged eggs beside some rather cold dry potato rounds. No seasoning no taste so I resorted in drowning my plate in ketchup,  which I never use. My wife had the chicken club which was lacking bacon, lettuce and tomato. My assumption is the hunter also farms for them. Laid on spongy bread with a chicken breast that was clearly highly processed. Accompanied by a salad that would shame only 7/11 version of a Caesar. Although 7/11 includes simulated bacon and a lemon wedge, when all ours included was a string from a rag. Our son got the winning plate which was a side of fruit and sausage. Remove the wrinkled berries and proof, not that bad! The free mints did help with the stomach pain afterwards but I don't believe this to be the intended function."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for brunch, the waitress was very personable and attentive. However, there was a hair in my friends eggs.. We tried to ignore it and enjoy our time but when we received hot sauce it was crusted  to the bottle and it was absolutely disgusting. We were repulsed by this and all agreed to leave. We told the server, and she couldn't FIND a manager...... Professional? I think not. We felt bad for the waitress, and left her a tip, but I will not return."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Despite the promise of their cringe-inducing \"eggcellence in eggxotic\" food motto, this restaurant has a pretty standard menu for a breakfast specialty joint.  The place lacks the charming over-exuberance of Cora's or the gritty authenticity of Nellie's. The menu and presentation is very reminiscent of Cora's, with pancakes, scrambles, crepes, etc. served with fresh fruit.

Seeing how it was lunchtime, I opted for the  one of the lunch specials (which I had to hunt down as the waitress didn't bring the specials insert). The deluxe burger platter special came with soup, tea/coffee, Caesar salad, home fries.  The soup was a good start, cream of mushroom with large recognizable pieces of 'shrooms.  The burger and sides were really big, and based on the tables around me, this carries across the whole menu. Unfortunately, the theme is quantity over quality, as the salad was flavourless, the fries undercrisped, and the burger just passable flavourwise.  I McGyver'ed the burger with one of the table side peanut butter packets, so this redeemed it somewhat.

In sum, this place is generic suburban styled, feeds you a lot, but leaves something to be desired on food preparation.  In a crowded market, EggsOasis needs to step it up to distinguish itself."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter in law and grand daughter purchased tickets to Ladies' Oasis Night.
Nothing was as advertised. No entertainment , no hand massages, no hair consultations , no music not even recorded. Everything had to be paid extra to the ticket price. They felt cheated."}
{"text":"Tables are VERY close together... Had numerous plates go directly over my head.  Only a matter of time until someone gets one dumped on them. The food was nothing to rave about and we found both our orders were cold upon arrival. Will definitely be making the longer drive to Cora next time we go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Been twice and there are still problems. I actually walked out today before my food came.

The first time I was there for breakfast. The service was great and the food was decent but when I ordered a latte the server warned me that people complain about their lattes. She said they don't have a real espresso machine because \"those machines cost a lot of money\". I went ahead anyway. It was undrinkable yet it cost the same as a latte across the parking lot at the Good Earth. Breakfast place with bad coffee drinks - not good. If you don't have an espresso machine then don't offer supposed espresso drinks and charge as much as if they were real.

I went for lunch today at 2 PM. I had a book and thought I'd get a quiet meal. The restaurant was 75% empty. I ordered a Diet Pepsi but they were out so I settled for water. I'm a diabetic so I can't drink the regular pop or orange juice offered. Then a large group of teens came in and were seated so close to me that we were almost bumping elbows. So many empty tables, I had a book and they couldn't spread people out a little? I'm not paying $12 for a tuna melt and water if I can't eat in peace so I left and picked up a grilled chicken sandwich, side salad and Diet Coke from Wendy's for half the price and ate it in peace."}
{"text":"I've been for breakfast there all the time and I liked it comparing to the rest of restaurants around."}
{"text":"Not bad. Unique home fries aka hash browns."}
{"text":"Great location, service and the food was fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch on the weekend, I ordered the smoked salmon+ tons of fruits( strawberry,watermelon,blueberry,grapes etc)+salads+brown bagel+cheese. Friend got the omelette. Very large portions only 15bucks each. A lot of people come to eat in the morning, n the waitress is very good."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. Can you call it a restaurant if they don't serve food?

I'm a breakfast person, and I've been a waiter. When this place was built near my house I was excited to try it out but quickly started hearing poor reviews. I like to give places a chance... but I should have listened.

I had some spare time on a Saturday morning and went by myself. It was unusually quite for a weekend (first red flag); for comparison, Cora's usually has a long line. There were less than ten people seated and about as many staff.

They sat me at a 4-person table and put down 4 menus, which was strange. Another waitress came by in a couple of minutes for drink orders and they came in a few more minutes. Not bad.

And then I was ignored for a full hour; wasn't asked to order food, didn't get refills on my drinks, no checkups. The waitress seemed to only have one or two other tables, I have no idea what she was doing.

When she finally checked up on me there was zero enthusiasm or empathy. Completely oblivious about whether my food was being prepared or not. Lethargic even. I asked for my bill and left; I wasn't going to wait another hour for overpriced food.

The Good Earth coffee shop across the street satisfied my hunger in minutes flat.

Questions: why are the staff so slow, are they volunteers? how is this place still in business?"}
{"text":"Not as egg-citing as I had hoped it would be. The fruit served with my breakfast was a little dry and so were the potatoes. The service was pretty good though. 
I think if they picked up on the overall food quality they will do well as there were lots of people lined up to get a table."}
{"text":"Heyyo, I've been there twice and I have no idea why the previous reviews are so negative... Maybe they went during the chaos when they were just having their grand opening? Not sure.. But both of my visits were positive. The first time I had an energetic, friendly and talkative waitress and she was fantastic! Sadly I forgot her name to give her kudos but I did tip well. Her service was great, the food was delicious, the cutlery was clean and the washroom facilities were very clean.

Second visit was much like the first but the waitress was different. Still kind with a pretty smile just not as talkative.. Maybe because it was 6am before I had to rush to the bus depot and we both felt like zombies hahaha. Still, food was still delicious and the service was good.

I'd definitely say Eggs Oasis is rated quite highly. Next time I go for breakfast in Calgary? It's either the buffet at the Kilkenny Bar or Eggs Oasis."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated place.  Like some other reviewers said, the food was really just ok.  The French toast I ordered - it's really just 2 tiny pieces of slightly toasted white bread; did a someone miss any ingredients or steps from the simple and classic French toast recipe?...  The friendly service earned most of the three stars I give here.  Was a little disappointed even though the service was good.  Food - it really feels like a knockoff version of Cora.  Thanks for the great service but no, I won't go again :-("}
{"text":"Average breakfast place.  The food came to us lukewarm which was a bummer as I would prefer a hot breakfast.  Eggs tasted fresh but the bacon strips tasted like from overnight.  Sausage links ok.  Never tried craton before and it's like a meat patty which tasted fine.  Potatoes can't really go wrong but because they came lukewarm, just didn't taste good.  The beans tasted good but its probably from can.

Waffles with banana and Nutella - the waffles were cold and soggy.  

Overall disappointed with the quantity."}
{"text":"Nothing What You Expect It To Be.
Food Is Very Bland, Dry, Service Is Alright (Depends Who You Get), Price Is Too High For The Bland Food. No Thanks. I'll Stick To Cora's."}
{"text":"Quite the evolution Eggs Oasis has made this year... and frankly I'm probably not going back at this point.  At one point they were an alternative to Cora's but they have slipped to an alternative to Denny's and my last visit they hardly made that standard. 

My last meal was pretty repulsive...  I ate half of it and regretted it for several hours following as I struggled with nausea.   I ordered an eggs benny but held the ham and added mushrooms (no substitutions anymore so the exchange of meat for mushrooms cost $2 more) with the eggs medium.  Neither egg was medium.  1 was underdone (the white was running) and the other was over hard.  Neither really work for a benny....   The Hollandaise was way to liberal and coated everything on the dish and it was a very poor example of a hollandaise.  If you cooks have issues making hollandaise,  you should probably buy it because it really messes the dish up when it's gross.  The hashbrowns were terribly over done and greasy so they really weren't edible either.   The fruit was the only thing that I enjoyed and even that wasn't the best fruit I've ever had (certainly not the fruit bowl Cora would serve). 

Service wasn't very good.   I think it's inexperience verse anything else but they should train the new servers if that's all they hire.   I pulled her over to look at the egg situation and she said \"wow, that sucks\" and that was that.   No offer to remake it or do anything to the bill.  She left me with the meal to finish without making sure it was OK to do so.  I finished the fruit and left the plate - she didn't say anything when she took away a plate that looked very similar to the plate she had brought out from the kitchen without further discussion about the product that came out.  If I was in a fighting mood I would have made a scene or got a manager but we just paid and left and I made a promise to myself not to be back."}
{"text":"We wanted to have a brunch style meal today and decided to try your restaurant.  It was busy which I always take as a good sign...lots of people equals quality service and food...not so this time.  We arrived and we got seated right away...took a bit for waitress to come but we ordered coffee and she was gone a long time before we got it.  My husband got a phone call at 11:02 the same time we were placing our order...meal took 45 min to arrive...time was tracked from phone call.  When meal finally arrived the waitress dropped off plates and took off.  When I looked at my order Oasis brunch my eggs were hard and looked like they had been sitting under heating lamp for a bit...ordered over easy.  Bacon was over cooked touched it and it crumbled.  Way too hungry to wait for new eggs as after I complained she went to the kitchen and they told her they could have 2 new eggs in 2 min...really than what took so long to make our meal?  No thank you...I was so surprised that there was no discount or even the coffee taken off the bill just lots of excuses about short staff and lots of customers.  Where was the manager walking the floor just reassuring the customers and taking accountability for the poor service...even a voucher for future visit would have been better than nothing.  Will probably not return to this spot with so many other restaurants in the area..."}
{"text":"i brought my 2year old son there and ordered him french toast upon its arrival it was only half cooked still wet and soggy i then asked for a new order when that one came again it was not fully cooked and the reply i received was well its french toast. french toast is bread dipped in raw egg which when uncooked can be extremely dangerous and to serve it not once but twice to someone especially a child with a bad excuse and no apology is unbelievable!!!!!

I will not be back as i can not trust that the food served there will be safe for my son to consume."}
{"text":"This place looks like a reliable chain from the outside, but more like a family run restaurant on the inside. Trouble is it's not really either. We got a table quick and the service was prompt and friendly but the food is definitely nothing to write home about. French toast was dry; bacon, sausage and ham all tasted the same. Just seems like they cut corners on food costs, yet charge big brunch prices. Kids enjoyed their meals but they were only filling with an adult-sized smoothie. I wanted to like it because of the friendly service, but with mediocre food I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"EggsOasis piqued my interest the moment it arrived on the elusive breakfast market. I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend on a Friday morning around 1 PM. There was no line, which is always a bonus. I was super impressed by how promptly we were seated and provided menus. However, the layout of the restaurant leaves something to be desired; crowded tables were laid out not unlike how a bad tetris player has poor spatial skills - it was a little too close for comfort, you could literally reach over and touch other patrons.

Now, I will deliver merit to the customer service. Our waitress was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and very quick. The food service is exceptionally fast; our food was rushed out in under 15 minutes. If you glimpse through an EggsOasis menu, something familiar strikes you: it's nearly identical to Cora's. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the food.

According to my beau, his food was fantastic. It was the DB5 (Eggs, Sausage, Potatoes, Banana Crepe). I ordered the ham benedict, which is your typical old-fashioned eggs benedict - it was...not nearly as delicious as I had anticipated. I am an eggs benedict lover and a bit of a self-proclaimed connoisseur, and this was a below average example of the dish. The good qualities? Delicious back bacon (albeit huge slices, enough to blanket the English muffins twice) and perfectly poached eggs (nice and soft, how I like 'em). The bad qualities? The sauce. Dear lord, the sauce. It definitely came from an inexpensive, cheap powder. No lemony flair, no buttery flavour. Absolutely gross. I would complain about the amount of sauce being too little, but...maybe that's a good thing. The eggs were also insultingly tiny - small grade, no doubt. I feel like they want to obtain as much profit as possible, not just from small eggs but from lack of fruit as well. I got three pieces of fruit, one of which had grey mould in the top. The only good thing overall were the potatoes; they're very different from anything I had ever had, and they were absolutely delicious.

For the quality of food you receive, I feel it's expensive. It wasn't overtly horrendous, though (about $28 for 2 of us). If you want more bang for your buck, though...I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Asked for a children's meal, as I have a card from my doctor saying that I can only have small portion sizes. I was told that the manager wouldn't honour the request, as the owner won't allow it. So not impressed. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the EggsOasis last weekend and were very happy with the service and the food. We had heard the name from friends, so decided to try it out.
The restaurant atmosphere is open and the decor is also nice. They advised us that the lineup would be long so we expected the waiting time. We were greeted with a very friendly and happy man. It definitely brightened the mood and he told us a little about the history of the place.

Time to order. The waitress was informative and suggested a variety of menu options. We had our heart set on the benedicts. So she ordered the ham benedict and I ordered the steak benedict with the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.

We got our drinks relatively fast, considering the place was very busy with a long lineup. The juices were fresh and that was a refreshing change. The food also came within a reasonable time and I really liked the steak benedict. It had sauteed mushrooms and the hollandaise sauce was lovely.

Overall we enjoyed our breakfast and would definitely go back! My only suggestion would be to improve on how we pay our bills. Better guidance from the servers. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this place. Thanks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and have been very satisfied with the food. The service isn't exceptional, but the waitress still met our needs considering how busy the place was.

The omlettes are fabulous, and the crepes are delicious.

Two people will run you anywhere from $30 - $40."}
{"text":"I ended up here twice in one week thanks to two unrelated business meetings.  Both occasions were for breakfast and I really have no complaints.  It was moderately busy, the service was good and the food was just fine.  Parking is easy and the place is nice and bright.

My first crack at the menu involved trying the Gardner's Medley.  I don't like raw onions and so they made it with sauteed onions instead.  The omelet was huge and I ended up taking half of my meal home.  I thought it was pretty good and there was a respectable amount of cheese.  My second meal choice was a crepe with cheese and spinach.  I did manage to eat the entire thing and I was full for the rest of the day.  No one else I accompanied had any issues with their meal.  

I would go back but check out the Royal Oak location for the next time."}
{"text":"Eggs oasis is a great breakfast place. Family friendly atmosphere, quick service, friendly staff. Food is always hot and cooked to order"}
{"text":"Hoping for excellent, I received average food with average service. Price slightly above average.
The setting and decor suggests this could be a great spot. Waited too long to get seated with confusion on the hostess list. When we were seated, our waitress did a solid job and brought the service level back up.
I ordered the ham Benedict which was accompanied by a fruit bowl and fried potatoes.  Hollandaise sauce needed some refinement but passable. 
Breakfast for two before tip - $30."}
{"text":"Horrible Service, Blah Food.  Will never be going back.

The waitress completely ignored us for about 15 minutes after we were seated.  I ordered a cappuccino only to be told they couldn't make me one.  Then my boyfriend and I ordered smoothies instead.  After another ten minute wait she brought us the wrong smoothies and said that it would be a hassle to make us the ones we wanted so to try these and see if they were okay, instead of waiting again we just drank them, even though they sucked, and had no taste.  

The food was nothing special.  Overall it was a very disappointing experience and I will never go back, and I have heard the same from 3 or four other people."}
{"text":"In the last year I have written a number of reviews on restaurants in proximity to my NW home, those reviews were easy to write as they followed a pleasant experience at those restaurants. I tend to call it like it is and how I found it, I am not only complementary as I do mention it when food, atmosphere, service and price are not, in my opinion, to my liking. Our particular far NW quadrant of Calgary has a very small selection of restaurants that are within a reasonable driving distance. For breakfast and brunch an even smaller selection. If we are to compare one against another it is only fair to compare, as they say, apples to apples and oranges to oranges. Until Eggs Oasis appeared five years ago we only really had a choice between Ricky's and Denny's. In my opinion when Eggs Oasis first came onto the scene, it was, and still is, head and shoulders above their established competition. Before I started this review I read every review previously posted on this site. Certainly many are not very generous with their remarks. I was motivated to write this review today after my breakfast there this morning. Once again I found my 'server' friendly and very efficient, my meal was there just as I finished my first coffee so obviously the kitchen staff were on their toes also. The food was hot and good, I immediately noticed and liked that they had changed to hash brown potatoes as I didn't really like the previous potatoes they had served since they had been open.

We definitely needed a better choice for a breakfast and brunch restaurant up here in the NW, Eggs Oasis has provided that, yes they have had teething problems, what new businesses don't. They have survived and even flourished during their five years of operation, that in itself is against tremendous odds. As a community we should be supporting them, in my opinion, as they certainly deserve it. If we compare apples to apples then they are the best choice also, I have frequented them all and I am speaking from experience.

If I was to rate the best breakfast / brunch restaurant in Calgary it would be Phil's, another local family owned several location business, something Eggs Oasis in years ahead could possibly aspire to be.

{"text":"I really love breakfast joints. I ordered the special bene: avocado with bacon. It was delicious. I wasn't wowed by the potatoes though (fairly bland). I like that I comes with a fruit bowl. It's like a little dessert.  Husband had DB 1 (typical bacon, saus, eggs, potatoes with the addition of a small blueberry crepe. He said it was alright, but nothing extra special."}
{"text":"Not really Gluten Free friendly, and over priced!"}
{"text":"Egg Oasis is a modern-looking restaurant with paintings of mountains and lakes.  I found out from the waitress that Egg Oasis is not affliated with Cora's.  The 2 restaurants are very similar in menu and fruit presentations.  Egg Oasis comes out of Quebec, the waitress told me.  

The food:  
Oasis Special - 2 eggs, over-easy, came with ham, baked beans, double order of sausages (opted for no bacon), crispy potatoes, crepe, toast, little bit of fruit - the baked beans are a nice addition to breakfast, the crepe was a plain crepe.

DB4 - Double something or another - came with 2 eggs, over-easy, spinach and cheese crepe, double order of sausages (opted for no bacon), crispy potaotes, toast, little bit of fruit - I liked the spinach and cheese crepe.  It was not bad.  My eggs were a little overcooked.  

Eggs with Sausages - basic over-easy eggs with potatoes and sausages and toast, little bit of fruit.

French Toast with a crepe and tons bananas and strawberries, side of cream, maple syrup - this was a pretty big plate; the crepe was the size of the round plate and top of the crepe was the french toast topped with bananas and strawberries.  Eat this only if you are extremely hungry!!  

The food took a while to come out; we waited for about 1/2 hour.  Coffee was refilled in our coffee containers.  Pretty good coffee.  

My pet peeve:  the tables are put too close together and it felt cramped and claustrophobic in the restaurant.  I can hear the whole conversation that is going on in the table beside us!  I could see the waitresses were also having difficulty meandering through the narrow aisles.  For some reason, the waitress never asked us how we wanted our toast as toast does come with the first 3 items listed above.  So, we waited another 5 minutes for the toast to arrive.  

To compare it to Cora's - I think this place is a little better in terms of quality of food.   We didn't have to wait in line today and merely strolled in.  I noticed that for a holiday Monday, people started to come in around 9 a.m. and the restaurant started to fill up pretty quickly.

Update:  The restaurant now has Shaw Free WiFi."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there 3 times and it is just enough. The first time we loved it, but the service was slow, though friendly. The second time we liked it but the service was even slower. The third time it took forever for food to come, the waitress apologized and said she would adjust the bill for inconvenience except she never did.
The food was good, can't complain. But they either need much quicker service or make the food worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Food is just average at prices indicative of higher quality.  Didn't even enjoy the toast.

Sad to say I've been twice now and just don't see the value.  My husbands eggs were poached hard and not soft and when he mentioned it the waitress made it seem like a big deal.  She wasn't sure what to do....just make it right!! 

Disappointing"}
