{"text":"I've enjoyed Politica several times now and tend to agree with several of the positive reviews here, so I'll simply add that Politica is  - Perfect for a comfortable yet classy date night thanks to a warm and welcoming ambiance (second to none for Patio season) and exceptional cuisine;   - An outstanding option for small groups, supported by more than enough variety on the menu to satisfy most every palate, and with just enough space so as not to feel crowded; and  - An absolute neighbourhood gem for the locals tucked away in the leafy low-rise King West district, with a kitchen that produces each and every dish with quality and consistency.  In short, Politica has never disappointed."}
{"text":"In the middle of residential homes and a mechanic's shop, I didn't realize Politica was even there until my sister mentioned it (she lives right across the street...and yes, I still missed it after a couple of years). Anyway, I went there on a Friday night for dinner at 6:30pm. I didn't think too much of getting reservations but I'm glad my friend thought ahead. Most of the tables were already reserved for the night. Dark, espresso brown decor (the usual) with a nice bar. Our server was thorough when he explained the specials, recommending a nice wine to go with my dish and we were well attended throughout the night. He gave us enough space for us to chat and didn't rush us out once we were done.   The complimentary bread came with hummus instead of butter, which was nice. I have a thing for hummus, so it made my boat float. I had the gnocci w/herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & shaved parm. The gnocci was lightly pan seared which gave it a nice subtle crispness to it. A good change from the way gnocci is usually prepared.  My friend had the veal capaletti which tasted as good as it looked (though the big chunk of brussel sprout threw him off. We didn't have room for dessert but we both ordered lattes. You can get a large or small (just less milk) for the same price. I enjoyed the latte - better than your typical coffee joint.   Overall this place was nice and I have no complaints. I'd go back to check out the desserts - my sister raves about it. Another thing, is that you can't go wrong with a  restaurant that plays Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels on the bar's TV."}
{"text":"I have to say I had concerns about going to this location as I received very mixed reviews from friends that had been there.  It is only a couple of blocks from the house so we decided to give it a try.  We made our reservation an hour later the day of and got a very cold reception when walking in the door, \"your reservation was at 8 PM not 9 PM\".  Our reservation was rescheduled to 9 PM so that did not get things off to a good start.    From there things went up hill, the atmosphere and vibe on a Saturday was good and we sat in a nice boot in the back.  The wine we ordered was fantastic but the grilled calamari was not my favorite.  Both of our mains were great!  I had the lamb and thought it was fantastic.  Based on the reviews I received I was very happy to get a great meal.    The service was average at best, if they put a little more focus on providing a better guest experience I think it would really boost their reviews and return business.  As soon as our plates were cleared the service ended, no cocktails and a quick check delivery.  It seemed like 80% of the people there were on date night so this surprised me.  Food was great, atmosphere was very nice and all that was needed to turn this into a perfect experience was better service.  That's just me though, I'm a sucker for a business that really focuses on the guest over and above the food."}
{"text":"Brilliant place, I come here every time I visit Toronto. Good food, a great atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went here for a Holiday Party.  The service was.. not good.  The waitress had a bit of an attitude and took her time coming around.    The food was good- not excellent.  The dessert was awful.  It was like a pita bread with some nutella on it.  Very dry and unsatisfying."}
{"text":"Found tucked between Queen and King West on Strachan you will find Politica. It took awhile for this \"resto bar\" to become popular, having walked by the patio for the last 2 summers only to see every table empty, but only a few Fridays ago it was almost impossible to find a seat. Thankfully my girlfriends and I arrived early since we had plans for after dinner and were able to grab a seat inside.   I have been to this restaurant a handful of times now and each time have walked away thinking \"we need to come here more often\". If not for the atmosphere, definitely for the food. In the summer the patio is now finally full and in the winter on those very cold nights, the inside of Politica feels like you are sitting in-front of a warm toasty fire having dinner by candlelight. Its a nice place for a romantic date ;)  On my last visit (like all my previous visit) I thought I would finally try the gourmet pizzas that everyone raves about, however after hearing about the Rack of Lamb special I couldn't resist. The Lamb is always on the menu, so I'm not really sure what was so \"special\" about it this evening but it didn't matter. The meat was mouth watering and it came with scalloped potatoes that are nothing like what your mother use to make at home. As a starter I had the goat cheese candied walnut salad and found it delicious! Overall, my meal was fantastic.   On previous visits I have tried both the Fillet Mignon (with goat cheese and prosciutto served along side) and Politica by the sea (linguine with shrimp, scallops, calamari and mussels) and would suggest these to anyone interested in having dinner at Politica.   I can't wait to return to Politica to try their pizza...if I don't change my mind again."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant with a nice interior, friendly staff in a colorful neighborhood. If you can find it, and handle the area you won't be disappointed. There pastas are great made with lots of fresh ingredients. I'll definitely be back ..."}
{"text":"My gf decided to write her one and only review on Politica.  A pretty good one at best.  I would agree with her on all that she's stated.  I was dying to check this place out since I found out an old high school classmate owned the resto.   The resto is located off of King Street next to the Dominelli body shop.  So maybe they own the whole block...lol.  Anyhow, so we sat on the patio.  Very quiet and away from all the hustle and bustle, I guess because of all the hassle from the G20 crap that was happening .  It was a quiet evening of people watching and enjoying each other's company, not in that particular order of course.   We first enjoyed our alcoholic beverages and shared some salad.  Then we ordered dinner.  I ordered their special which was ravioli and she ordered the osso bucco. I liked my ravioli but she wasn't a fan of the osso bucco because of all the fat.  I decided to get another drink and we ordered dessert.  I ordered a cheese cake and she had her nutella pizza and they were delicious too. She didn't finish the pizza.  Decently priced and definitely a place I would recommend going to for a lovely evening out as a couple or with friends."}
{"text":"Just got back here from a team lunch so I wanted to get this done while the memory was still fresh.  Never noticed this place before but from the outside you could easily miss it due to the trees obscuring the view but they have a nice enough patio where we chose to sit.  The menu looks good, some of the dishes with their own unique style. Ordered Mango Chili Ribs for appetizers and Grilled Salmon for mains.  If I was paying for this I would have skipped a starter that costs $14 and although nice was not worth that much.  The Grilled Salmon was a strange combination of a decent cut of salmon and fruit and salad. The Avacado it was served on is absolutely pointless not to mention tasteless, like eating green goo.  This dish did not tickle the taste buds and I was left wishing I ordered something else, looking around at the table the pasta dishes looked good and went down well along with one of my colleagues who ordered an omelette.  Service was great, the place was not too busy for a lunch time and we did not have to wait long for the food, which came all at once."}
{"text":"This one was a real crap shoot because my internet date chose it and when I got there at 7:30pm on a Friday night there were only a few people seated so I started thinking to myself, okay this could really turn out horribly in a number of ways (internet date included), but aside from some late-arriving wine (apology accepted) and kinda bland scallop appetizer, the sea bass entr√©e feature was perfectly cooked and presented beautifully in a little colourful painting on my plate and my date didn't turn out too bad either because we ended up staying for four hours and the restaurant was a bit more full by then (update: even though my date complimented my aesthetically pleasing brow-to-lid ratio to my surprise and delight, we don't see each other anymore because that's not really enough to sustain a healthy internet relationship, and I can't say for certain at this point whether or not I will return to this restaurant but maybe if I happen to be on that secluded corner at some point in the future)."}
{"text":"A neighbourhood restaurant for me, I'm delighted to be able to walk around the corner and enjoy delicious food and lovely service.  I've tried a few items on the menu - loved the mango chili ribs, the crab cakes and the lamb appetizers, the salmon main (I liked the fruit, a creative dish), the unusual pizza combo's and the yummy pasta's.  Always a good list of several specials, covering all the categories.  When I have stumbled across a dish I didn't like (personal preferences), the staff have been very accommodating.  They are also very accommodating of my likes/dislikes and have frequently adjusted a dish to suit me.  Prices, I'd describe as \"high-medium\",  I don't go every day, but definitely a favourite."}
{"text":"food was blanned, atmosphere was not there for the expectations and location, we had a creme bulee which was cold and not fresh at all, food was not exciting and service was not great"}
{"text":"Everything we've ordered from Caesar salad to rack of lamb to their pasta dish is unbelievably delicious. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and service."}
{"text":"OMG, this is the best Italian restaurant I know of. Grilled calamari, pizza, leaks-asparagus soup are to die for. Awesome menu, a little bit rich, but very tasty and versatile.  The only thing  that my frugal self is sorry about is that everything good in life costs money :) So I couldn't give it five stars even though I  understand they totally deserve 5 stars. But this is the place i would take anyone to, any guests, and they will be satisfied, I am sure. Especially is someone else picks up the bill :)"}
{"text":"When we went the place was completely empty. The server was very personable and attentive. The food was good but not great. I ordered the scallop carbonara which was very tasty. My friends had complained that their meals were fatty and they didn't finish them."}
{"text":"This spot is easy to miss - it's in a bit of a random spot, beside a car garage - but you do not want to miss out on this place!  I came here with my family for dinner on a long weekend, and it was oddly deserted. Great for us though - we got amazing service. It was very dimly lit, which I found annoying initially, but over the course of the night, it added to the calm ambiance of the place.  Our waitress was really friendly and knowledgeable, and gave great recommendations for both food and drink. We started off with a bottle of aged Italian red wine. Though none of us considers ourselves to be wine connoisseurs of any sort, my cousin thought the wine tasted a bit off. The bartender tasted it and confirmed this... They apologized profusely and gave us a new bottle. I had a really hard time choosing a main dish since everything looked so good! I ended up going with the tiger shrimp pasta, which was delicious. I licked the plate clean. Everyone else really enjoyed their meal as well, whether it was salad, pizza, pasta, or seafood.  Overall, we had a great experience at Politica. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Bought a voucher on Dealicious so I decided to redeem it tonight. I was really excited to eat here as I read the many wonderful reviews of this place... after the fact, I'm in my room scratching my head... wondering if I missed something.  Both the interior and exterior of this place are really nice. It's chic and swanky. The drink menu is extensive. I ordered the lychee martini and it was truly a 'meh.'  The menu is overly priced for mediocre food. I ordered the salmon and it was quite bland... reading the description in the menu, this dish had potential to be amazing. My dad ordered the pizza and it was apparently drenched in grease (you can get something like that at Pizza Pizza for 1/3 of the price).   I have one more voucher for this place (it's never a good idea to multitask while carrying a credit card... you might buy more than you want) so I have no choice, but to give Politica a second chance. I shall update my review if necessary after Visit #2."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the appetizer I ordered was unavailable, however a friend recommended the Grilled Calamari and it was quite good. My main dish was fantastic, Osso Buco on a bed of risotto, and the price seemed fair for the quality of the meal. The size of the meal was large without being obnoxious, I left feeling full.  One pet peeve of mine was the music. Granted I was with a friend so it was not a romantic meal, but how can an \"upscale\" restaurant play Retro 80s music?  It didn't fit with the ambiance of the restaurant whatsoever."}
{"text":"Politica is not just our most convenient local, but a huge bonus because it is consistently good, a nice atmosphere, provides good service, and has the best pizza around (yes, that includes Libretto and Terroni) - my fave is the Politica's Brother. We've brought many friends here and their reviews have been uniformly positive. It has taken awhile for the place to find its stride and now you need a reservation to make sure you get a seat. One additional note, we've had them provide food for a party at our house and they offered excellent amounts at good prices, and even helped walk the food over to our house - right from their oven to ours! (I wouldn't expect that as standard service, especially now that they are much busier.)"}
